BOARD OF TRADE, ^A7, WHITEHALL GARDENS,LONDON, S.W.1.I circulate, for the informa-tion of the War Cabinet, a !!emorandum by the Controller of Coal Mines on the subject of Brewing and Halting.A.H.S.15th August, 1917.
mmxsG   aid   miots &amp;1 IWASTE 01&apos; FUEL AID LABOURBreweries use Fuel both for power and for heating purposes 9 and when the considerable heat losses have to &quot;be distributed over a much restricted output the amount of fuel required for each &quot;barrel &quot;brewed (a largely increased as compared with the amount used under normal conditions of output *The voluntary returns of fuel consumption obtained in the First Census of Production afford data for estimating that the average amount of coal used in brewing, apart from malting, in 1907? when the &quot;bulk barrelage of the United Kingdom was 35,359,000 barrels, was at out 72 lbs, for each bulk barrelsShortly after the output was restricted to 10*000,000 standard barrels per annum it was estimated that the coal used per bulk barrel would be increased by 50 per cent oyer that used in normal times 9 and that in consequence, on the assumption that 12?500,000 bulk barrels woiLj-d be brewed, 200,000 tons more coal per annum would be used than if the permitted barrelage were produced in a limited number of breweries of average efficiency working at the output for which they were designed0As the coal consumption per barrel varies between wide limits in different breweries] the suggested saving of 200,000 tons would be largely increased by confining operations to the most efficient breweries^ each serving a natural area of supply, with the consequent elimination of fuel losses in unnecessary rail and motor transports.In the beginning of June the Coal Mines Pepartment obtained from all Steam Raisers Returns of the total amount of coal used in the year ending 31st March, 1917, and of their then weekly requirements.   The figures so obtained have, in the case of 18 breweries in the London district, with an aggregate output of nearly 4,000,000 bulk barrels in 1916/17, been correlated with the corresponding figures of bulk barrelage furnished by the Board of Customs and Excise0The results show that the average amount of coal required permbulk barrel rose from about 60 lbs. in 1916/17, when output was
already somewhat restricted to about 100 lbs..in the following nuarter or an increase of about 80 per cent..It   0&quot; Id therefore appear that the original estimate was considerably below the mark, and that the possible saying of fuel, if brewing were concentrated in breweries of only average efficiency, may bo over 300,000 to    ;u.r annum on the 10,000.,000 ot; -udard bar r el output .Returns of employment furnished to the Ij/u;,trial (W..r Inquiries) Br. neb   how that in eight of theso London breweries, with an aggregate output of ever 2-j- million bulk barrels in the year 1916/17 a reduction of the rato of output by about 54 per cent, as compared with the year 1916/17 was accompanied by a reduction of only 21 per cent of the male or 23 per cent of the total number of persons employed.Up to the present it has not boen considered judicious to make direct enquiries from breweries as to their fuel consumption per bulk barrel brewed under varying conditions of output except in a few isolated instances;   in the case of one large Mialvr-d Brewery where full figures have been supplied a reduction of the rate of output by 56 per cent as compared with the year 1916/17 was accompanied by an increase of fuel consumption per bulk barrel of nearly 70 &quot;ier cent,, and a reduction lof only 16 per cent cf the male and 6 per cent of the total number of persons employed.There is ground for partly attributing the small reduction of male employees to the operation of the Restricted Occupation Or.-.er of 27th February-, 1917.The Piixst Census of Production returns afford data for estimating that the average amount ef fuel user1, in malting amounted to about 90 lbs, per cuarter in 1907.ISo general investigation has bt?en made by the Coal Mj cs De-HMtment into the relative efficiency of different kilns, but it is understood that in the large Mirll...r&amp; Brewery already referred to only 56 lbs. per quarter were used in modern kilns, and 7? lbs.
per quarter on the average in old and modern kilns, so that the variations in fuel consumption would appear to he considerableoIf malting is again permitted steps should therefore be taken to confine operations so far as practicable to the most efficient plant, and if this principle could be extended to brewing the saving in fuel and incidentally of labour would be very considerable,Gr a    C 014th August, 1917.
