Of.10AGW/015.DEPARTMENT 03? INFORMATIONINTELLIGENCE BUREAU.WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   GERiLANY,August 2nd to August 9th, 1917.THE NEW GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENTS IN GERMANY AND PRUSSIA;State (who are not &quot;Ministers&quot; but technically, and in many respects, practically, &quot;representatives&quot; of the Chancellor) and of new Prussian Ministers, may not be a symptom of &quot;reac^ tion&quot;, but they at any rate furnish the strongest possible evidence that tbe system of authority and officialise is to be maintained.     There are only three members of Parliament among the appointments.    Herr von Krause, who apparently is not a member of the Reichstag but of the Prussian Chamber, is appointed Secretary of tbe Imperial Department of Justice. The aged Dr. Spahn, titular leader of the Catholic Centre, who has a seat both in the Reichstag and in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies, is made Prussian Minister of Justice. He is an eminent lawyer and judge, and is doubtless well fitted for the post.     But he is approaching senility and had a break-down after, and perhaps in consequence of, his democratic lieutenant, Erzberger&apos;s famous outburst in the General Committee of the Reichstag,     The third parliamentary appointment, Kerr v. Eisenhart-Rothe, the new Prussian Minister of Agriculture, is an agrarian from Pomerania, and will doubtless share the views of his predecessor, von Schor-lemer-Alst.2.      It may be conjectured that the appointment of a number of little-known officials to Prussian Ministerial offices, is intended to secure a greater degree of subor-dinafcion of the Prussian Ministers to the Minister-President,1.The appointments of new Imperial Secretaries of
Michaelia.     Successive German^ Chancellors, and especially Bethmann-Hollweg, have had to complain of opposition from their ministerial colleagues in Prussia.     Thus v.Schorlemer, at the time of the Hnperor&apos;s Daster Message, indulged in public criticism of the new &quot;democratic(I)&quot; line of policy in sympathy with the protests which were being made by members of the Prussian Upper House.     Hothing can be more discon-oerting for an Imperial Chancellor than the hostility of his Prussian oolleagues, a handicap of which Bismarck himself often had to complain.3.      It is interesting to notice that an official of one of the Socialist organisations, Herr August Mtiller, has been associated as Under-Secretary with Herr von Waldow, the new Imperial Food Controller.     Mtlller is an official of the Hamburg Social Democratic Consumers1 Union.     He has also edited a Socialist newspaper and has been imprisoned for lfese-majeste.It has been noted that the Social Democracy has created a bureaucracy of its own, which in many respects -particularly in point of efficiency - resembles the Prussian State bureaucracy.     According to Preuss (Das deutsche Volk und die Politik) the State bureaucraoy has to its great surprise discovered the bureaucracy of Socialism only during the war.     Preuss says that &quot;next to the German Army, there is nothing more Prussian than the German Social Democracy&quot;.4.      The appointment of von Kuhlmann as Prussian Minister for foreign Affairs and Imperial Secretary of State in the Foreign Office, is criticised in some quarters as entailing the danger of a too conciliatory attitude towards I&amp;igland.    l?o one who knew Kuhlmann In London will suspect him of any prejudice in our favour.     He doubtless has more brains than Zimmermann.     He is reported to have said here in
-3-Iioiido-n after relations--were&quot; &quot;broken off: &quot;If Germany had wnly waited ten years more, she would have had practically all she wanted without war&quot;.He is further reported to have said at that time that the entry of England would prevent a rapid decision on the Western front.     Germany would probably be held up there, in which case she would immensely strengthen her forces on the Eastern front and smash Russia.5.     It was generally expected that Helfferich would have to go as well as Zimmermann.     He was compromised in three ways: (l)   By his failure as Imperial Secretary of State forfinance - a post which he exchanged for the Imperial Home Office.(8) By his cocksureness about indemnities for Germany.(3) By his confident predictions of an early and decisive success of the submarine campaign. And now he is appointed to double office - (a) to the Imperial Secretaryship of the Interior, which makes him vice-Chancellor, (b) to   a Prussian Ministry of State without portfolio.     He is to act in the Prussian Ministry as vice-President, a very impor-tant post in view of tbe demands of iSax Imperial affairs upon the Chancellor.     It is probable that he is intended to exercise a liberalising influence upon the Prussian Ministry, or, at any rate, to keep it in tcuch with feeling in the Reichstag, where he will represent the Chancellor when Michaelis cannot attend.G. S.
1.     Telegraphic reports that have been received show that, as might have been expected, there is unfavourable criticism of the new Government in the liberal and Socialist press on the ground that it is a mere administration of officials, that there is no evidence of any desire to strengthen parliamentary institutions, and that the Reichstag has been ignored.     It is in fact a Government of authority, and the personality of the individual members of the administration is, as compared with this, of comparatively little importance.     There is, however, no suggestion that the new Government is in any way one of reaction, and it is to be assumed that the changes in the Prus-sian Ministry indicate a present intention of carrying out the promised reforms of the Prussian franchise.2.     There is a general agreement in all shades of the press that the attempt of the Reichstag to assert its authority has, for the time, failed, and the cause for the failure must be found in the weakness of the Reichstag itself.     On this there is much veryfrank comment.     It leads at the moment to a good deal of rather academic discussion in the liberal press; there can be very little doubt that the matter will be reopened when the Reichstag meets in September, and probably another attempt will be made by that party to assert its authority for the conduct of foreign affairs.     Evidence is accumulating from all sides as to the extreme dissatisfaction with which the con-duct of this department of Government for the last few years is regarded.3.    Por the moment, however, the new administration, which has avowedly been formed to carry on a &quot;defensive&quot; war, in close association with the military authorities, has got into a perhapi unexpectedly favourable position,     It has gained much from the circumstances attending its birth,   the Russian debacle has for the moment removed the fit of depression and deep anxiety which
did more than anything; else to bring about tbe fall of tbe late Chancellor.     $or the moment the fear of a complete collapse of Austria has been, if not removed, at least postponed.4.     The whole tone of the press has for the moment becomemuch more optimistic than it was. Among other things we may note that numerous articles haveappeared on the financial situation incorporating not ineffec-tive criticism of the financial position of Great Britain anddrawing attention to the anxiety which, it is suggested, existson this point.     Equally valuable to the Government has beenthe use which has been made in Germany of speeches reported fromEngland and other countries which were capable of being interpre-ted as showing that Germany has no choice erxoept to continue the&apos;war to a successful conclusion, because the intentions of theAllies, as translated from public utterances of responsiblestatesmen, are first to dismember Germany, and secondly to ruinher economically.     The encouragement of the belief that thevery existence of the country is at stake is the strongest cardin the hands of the German Government.     This, above all, helpsthe military party.     If this were removed, it would be difficultto stem the consuming desire for a speedy peaoe which, accordingto accounts which come to us from very varied sources, prevailsnot only in the country but also in the army.     The masses ofthe people are ready for peace and would welcome it on terms thata year ago would have been rejected with indignation.     They read another winter of war;   as soon as the autumn comes on the shadow of the winter will be over them.     vve shall hear of strikes and olisorders.5.     1* is noticeable that Scheidemann has been strongly opposed at public meetings, and it seems clear that the impor-tance of the Minority Socialists is much greater in the country than the actual number of their representatives in the Reichstag
-TKruld^-arppear. -to^ djo/lioate.     But on.alJ^e^eiitj*a^^^      .regarding peace Inarms, *Vb^Mixi&amp;xtt^ ^^ are on theside of the Entente against their own Government and againsteven the Majority Socialists.5f    THE PAPAX NOTE:     Knowing as we do the activiey ofthe Catholic Propaganda for Peace which has been conductedduring the last few months in Switserland and the apparent con-nection of this movement with Austrian, Bavarian and otherGerman Catholics, it is natural to suppose that the Papal Notehas not been issued without the previous knowledge and approvalof the Austrian and probably also of the German Government.As against this, it has been pointed out that the Note notobscurely suggests some compromise with regard to Alsace-LorrainaThe following is the relevant paragraph:. &quot;As regards territorial questions, as, for example, those in discussion between Italy and Austria, between Germany and Prance, there is reason to hope that in consideration of the immense advantages of a durable peace with disarmament the conflicting parties will be disposed to examine them with a conciliatory disposition, taking into account, so far as is just and possible, as we formerly said, the aspirations of the peoples, and with this object, accommodating sectional interests to the general good of the great society of mankind.&quot;6.      The fact thfirJ jiuch a compromise is suggested ishowever not necessarily inconsistent with general German supportand approval.     It is quite true that, especially during therecent weeks, the German press of all shades of opinion, exceptthat of the Independent Socialists, has taken the line thatthere must be no surrender on the question of Alsace-Lorraine;a strongly Liberal paper such as the Frankfurter Zeitung adoptslanguage identical almost with that of the Norddeutsche Allge-meine  eitun^.   They refuse to recognise that there is anyAlsace-Lorraine question, and treat with ridicule the idea thatwhen the German armies are occupying Lille, they should be askedto surrender Metz or Strasburg.     The whole honour of the Germanarmy and the German Nation is fully pledged to the positionthat they will not surrender any German territory.
-4-7.      As late as ..Satarday-,August 4, at a mee^thg held in the Reichstag buiiiing on the third-anniversary of the outbreak of the war with England, Michaelis said:   &quot;We will hand on the inheritance entrusted to us by our fathers to coining generations undiminished&quot;.     And this is quoted with approval by the Frank-furteir:   &quot;That is it, we will hand on Germany to our successors undiminished&quot;.     German opinion is very strong on this point.It may, however, be suggested that while they adopt this view as against the peace aims put forward in Prance and England, and would oppose to the uttermost any diminution of German territory so long as this would appear to be a surrender forced upon them by the Allies;   they might still envisage the possibility of some sort of compromise as to the matter if this could be put forward in the form of a concession to a request made by a neutral and friendly power such as the Pope, if he requested them to do it for the sake of the future peace of Europe.     If they could bring it about that the war ended in such a way that they came out victorious, or at least with such an amount of success that they could say: &quot;All the efforts of the enemies of Germany have not succeeded in diminishing by an inch the integrity of German soil&quot; - we can imagine the Emperor being willing afterwards to make what he would represent as a beau geste and offering a comparatively small part of Alsace-Lorraine to tbe Pope that he might transfer it to J&apos;rance as a gift.     This would have the advantage that the Germans might believe it would help to the establishment of a general understanding between the European nations as against the English and Americans.J.W.R. 17 August, 1917.
