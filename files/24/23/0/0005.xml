i p.OPERATIONS.SECRETFrom:- General Barter. To:-      C.I.G.S.12/8/17. Handed in at 5.55 p.m.1185.The Chief of the General Staff and the Roumanian Military Representative have given me the latest information regarding the situation in Roumania and I am sending it, in case Ballard&apos;s intelligence from Jassy is delayed.Roumanian Corps forming right wing of 2nd Roumanian army fell back on August 10th in conjunction v/ith Russian 24th Corps of the 9th Army practically to original positions west of Onecmi and Okna.   It is understood that five enemy divisions are attacking them.   Apparently, Sth Russian Corps is moving from its front westof Panci.....to support 2nd Roumanian army.    On tho right of thisarmy, the 9th Russian army oannot be counted upon to fight.2nd Roumanian Corps of the 2nd Roumanian army still holds line previously gained.    It has repelled several German subsidiary attacks but has been obliged to take up front vacated by 8th Russian Corps.In the centre of the Roumanian front the enemy is attacking with five divisions in front line and three in reserve from Focsani along the railway and in north-easterly direction towards Tetuch and have advanced about three miles.   1st Roumanian division is opposing it.   On the left of the front the Russian 4th Corps of 6th army is attacking with the three divisions of which it is composed on general line from Underecti-Nemoloca, in order to take Germans in flank in the direction of Focsani.   All depends on whether this Russian Corps will fight 6r not.   As the Germans have greatly %  thinned their general line to constitute their main attacking forces, it has practically nothing in front of it and it ought to be able to strike the German flank to-morrow August 13th, as it has altogether about 22 miles to march. I have been unable to ascertainiwhether
whether the Germans&apos;have reinforced this front lately.    Present fighting is considered decisive as regards evacuation or otherwise of Roumania,,I am informed that position on Russian south-western front is rather more satisfactory to-day.I have just returned from Petrograd where political position is worse than I expected.   Ambassador and I agree that it is of the utmost importance that Government should understand clearly that British Government cordially approves of Kornilof &apos;s measures to restore discipline,     I suggested to the Ambassador that he should congratulate Kerenski on his support of Kornilof3 whether he be genuine or not, if only to indicate what view is taken by the British Government.    He will speak to hira to this effect and will also delicately hint at the possibility of our refusing to send more guns etc, until there is some indication that they will be put to good use.In my opinion it is of the greatest importance that Kornilof should feel that he has support from outside, in order that he may not weaken in his intention.,   as, otherwise, I think he very possibly may.If he goes I see no hope of any improvement of efficiency for     a considerable time.Tomorrow I am seeing Kornilof to try to keep him up tothe mark.
