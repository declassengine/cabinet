From Viceroy, Foreign Department, ISth August 1917. (Repeated to Teheran.) (Received at India Office 19th, 4 p.m.)Secret. Persia. Your telegram of the, 10th. August. Frank and (? friendly) exposition of our very simple aims and objects in Persia, vide our telegram of the 16th August, regarding Persian Baluchistan, would appear appropriate preliminary to discussion of points raised in Persian Memorandum. If we could break down Persian mistrust of our intentions which appears to be focussed on South Persian Rifles, there should be some prospect of coming to a working understanding., To this end we might promply agree in principle to the two proposals put forward in the Memorandum. There would be little risk in this, as neither proposal is the least likely to materialise in the near future. We should at the same time point out that the South Persian Rifles, which were raised with the consent of recent Persian Government in our joint interests, and are being maintained entirely at our expense, are the Only safeguard we have against recurrence of outrages against our Consuls and colonies. We could not agree to break up of this Force in being until the Persian Government could show they.had an adequate force ready to replace it. As suggested, however, in our telegram of 25th J une, we might readily agree to discuss a greater measure of Persian control over South Persian Rifles even during war.
