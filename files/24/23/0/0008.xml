WAR CABIBET.BRETOG AgP THE RESUMPTION OF MALTING.Note by the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies.The Royal Commission on V/heat Supplies urge that the effect on jtocfcs of breadstuffs should be the first consideration when a decision is taken as to the extent to which brewing and malting is to be permitted.J.       The wheat available for importation into this country is definitely limited in quantity and it is already clear that the rate of admixture of Ither cereals In the loaf must be maintained at not less than 20;S throughout the cereal year commencing on 1st September nest.   Barley is the best grain for this purpose and it is therefore almost equal to wheat in breadstuff ?alue,[.       The barley grown in this country will not provide the quantity of Cereals required for admixture even if it were possible to reserve the faole crop for the loaf.   The importation of cereals must therefore be in-fcreaeed by the amount used for brewing.I[.        Tonnage difficulties make it necessary to obtain the main supply of 6orGals from the United States and Canada but even with their needs lessen-\(x by this shorter voyage, the Commission are urged at every meeting of  he Tonnage Priority Committee to reduce their present and future demands for tonnage.?.       The Commission have been requested by the Treasury to limit their fnirohases in the United States ..and especially in Canada, but if supplies If &quot;breadstuffa are to be maintained very large purchases must be made in these countries.   In Canada alone credits to the amount of some / l 70,000,000 pH be required from the time the crop commences io move early in October Intil the navigation closes early in December. Ih       The harvest in the U.3.A. and Canada is not complete and there is at present no reason to suppose that the exportable surpluses of the various suitable cereals will bo more than sufficient to meet the needs of the jnited Kingdom and the Allies for breadstuffs.U       For these reasons the Commission are strongly opposed to proposals vnich may result in a shortage of breadstuffs and must greatly increase fii:-iculties experienced in obtaining the necessary tonnage and finance at [ ulme wiien tonnage and finance are already definitely limiting factors.r Table is attached showing the effect of the various proposals onreadstuffs supplies, freight and finance.(3d) J.
