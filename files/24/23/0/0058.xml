T \15^)4 ^^ii&amp;^Raport^ ef the Commission of Enquiry into IndustrialUnre3t..I circulate to my colleagues a hound copy of the Reports of the Commission of Enquiry into Industrial Unrest, together with 9, brief note pointing out hov; far it has &quot;been found possible to take immediate -action to meet the recommendations made.At the same time I desire to draw attention to twovery im-portant recommendations which cannot be dealt with immediately, namely, the industrial position in Vales, and the inadequacy of housing accommodation in Borrow and certain parts of Scotlandand Wale?.   The first of these points I propose to discuss with the Chairman of the Wales Commission, Mr. D. Lleufer Thomas, on Monday next.   It is clear that something must be done to cope with the difficulties arising out of the industrial conditions in Wales, and action   should be taken before *.oute disturbances take place.   On the second point, I should be glad to h^ve the view3 of my colleagues.   Steps hsvo been taken by the President of the Loc*l Government Board to ensure that the housing problem is adequately dealt with after the war, but in the meanwhile it is quite clear to me that the position shewn in the report on Barrow callsfor urgent treatment.   I think that the limitation now imposed on the LocaI Government Board as regards sanctioning loans over  500 in value, should be modified so as to admit of sanction beins given to adequate loans for housing purposes in special districts, such as Barrow, where the shortage of housing is a very serious impediment to the prosecution of the war;   or alternatively that the Hunitions Department should deal with these places in the same way as- it has already done at Gratna, Clydebanic and elsewhere.0. iT. B.18th. August, 1917.
