SECRET DxtelligeBe a. JBureauDepartment of Information FFW/009Weekly Report on France     IXThe most definite event that has taken in plaoe in Prance since the report of July S7 is the adjournment of the Chamber.   And it is not at all the least favourable.     For under the present condition of things in France a Ministerial crisis of a serious kind might easily occur, if the Chamber were sitting, and might have very unfortunate results.     By the 18th September when the Chamber reassembles many things nay have happened to make a crisis loss likely and less danger-ous.     The Allied offensive in the Westts not likely always to be held back by a week of continuous rain;   and if it is able to attain suc-cesses which are not only real but visible, the purely parliamentary and personal questions which so often agitate the Chamber may be seen in their true insignificance.     By September 18th the Stockholm affair can scarcely fail to have become less immediately dangerous.     By then one of two things will have happened.     Either the Conference will have been abandoned in consequence of what now seems to be the definite de-cision of four out of the five principal allied governments not to grant passports for it:   or it will be taking place, or about to take place without the presence of British, French, American or Italian representatives.     In any case the question, like all ohoses jugees, ought to have a good deal less parliamentary explosive of the dan-gerous sort in it by that time than it has now.But there is no doubt that even now, with the Chamber not sitting and no opportunities of parliamentary oratory or intrigue, Ithe situation of K. Ribot and his colleagues is far from easy or ae-cure.     Just before the rise of the Chamber two divisions occurred,
- 2 -both of which were in different ways of bad omen.     One was in the last days of July when the government only had a majority of 200 to 157 (with 200 abstentions) in the debate on the business of a certain If. Chappedelaine who had received a commission (afterwards with-drawn) to &quot;buy steamers in Japan.     The other division though ap-parently much better was really in seme ways worse.     On the 2nd of August IL Renau&amp;el, the leader of the Socialists, interpellated the Government on their general policy especially with reference to the German allegations about the left bank of the Rhine and with regard to the &quot;society of Nations.&quot;    The result was a somewhat sharp passage of arms between him and U. Ribot and a majority for the Government of 392 to 61.     But large as the Majority appears to be it for the first time includes no Socialist.   On the last great division ongeneral policy after the Secret Session oifi June Sth nearly half the Socialists, Including M. Renaudel himself, voted with the Government, the real cause of the change is uncertain.     It may have been M. Ribofs frank scepticism as to the possibility of trusting for the security of Europe to the Sooiety of Nations, a great idea which has a little turned the heads of the Socialists, and has given a great opening to Paoifists of the Caillaux and &quot;Pays&quot; order, though all nominally admit that they recognise the preliminary necessity ofdefeating the Germans.     Ot It may have been his tactical unwisdom in alluding to the fact that a body of Socialists had made a written protest against going to Stockholm.     But whatever the cause, there is the result.   And grave in itself, it will not be made less so by the events of the last few days in England.     The English Labour vote for Stockholm and the resignation of Mr Henderson will certainly strengthen the opposition between the French Socialists and the French Government which refuses to let them go to Stockholm-     Already the important Socialist Federation of the Seme has voted a demand that
M, Albert Thomas should resign if the Cabinet maintains its re-fusal to grant passports.The whole change of attitude or a large part of it, both in Franca and England, must be^down to the credit or discredit of the Russian Revolution.     In France the conversion of the Minority Socialists and ultimately of the whole party to the Stockholm pro-gramme is due to the influence of the delegates who went t;- Petro-grad.     The same thing has happened with Mr. Henderson in England. In the French case the dominating influence seems to have been the fascination, always so strong in France, of idealistic theories. In the case of 1* Henderson it appears rather to have been thepractical advantage of conciliating one important Ally.     3ut therresult is the some and leads to a situation \vhich is as embarassingAin Franoe as it is in England.This is not the place to express any opinion as to the policy of going to the Conference.     But one or two facts may be mentioned.     On the one hand it is noticeable that the French Conservative papers treated the important argument of the advantage to be gained by setting out the Allied case before thB Germans and Neutrals more respectfully when it was put in England by Mr. Henderson than they had when it was put by their own Socialists in Paris.     And no doun from the French ^&quot;int of view as well as the English this argument would greatly gain in strength from the German Chancellor^ reported refusal to allow German Socialists to go unless the question of the responsibility for the outbreak cf war is eliminated from the programme.     On the other hand it may be noted that the -ussian delegates who have had so much in-fluence in this matter, at a banquet in Italy, reported in the Paris papers from the Italian Socialist &quot;Avanti&quot;, declined to join with their hosts in a telegram to M. Kerensky and that at
another meeting one of them made a great Panegyric of Lenin.     And one other point worth noting may be got from a hint in the Debate . If there are any risks in a Conference, can they be said to be equal as between the German Government and those of the Allies?   If the German Socialists bring back sheaves from Stockholm, the C-overnment ?d.ll make its nrofit cf them.     If they make any -ororiises or admissions the Government will merely repudiate or Igncre them.     It is totally independent of them and can use them without being in any way affected by their wards or actions.     But neither the French ncr the English Governments which are dependent on popular support would have either the desire or the ioower to set asicle without consideration resolutions anoepted by such powerful bodies as the French Socialist and the English Labour parties.This point has a special bearing on the aelicate -oosition of M. Thomas.     He had told the tJooialist party on &apos;u.7ust 3 and 4th that if they deoided he must resign, he would plaoe himself at the head of those elements in the party who were against a premature peace and wculd entirely support the Government of National Defence.     The re-3iilt was that by 59 vote3 to 9 the rcrty authorised his remaining on in the Cabinet.    But according to the &quot;ays a kind cf committee was    ^ appointed to watch the Government and H. ?nc?na3, and re-oT)en the question if either did anything questionable.     What will haupen now in view of the Governments refusal to issue passports for Stockholm?It is at present impossible to say.     Meanwhile M. Thomas has last Sunday made a long and important speech to his constituents ex-^luining in great detail the attitude of himself and his party.     No batter statement has appeared of the case of those who, with the fullefe sense of the objeotiens to the Conference, which he dees not conceal, have yet decided ont ihe balance of considerations that it is advisable to go.     The full report of only the first half of the speech has so
-far reached London. But even this occupies seven columns of the Humanity Mitch of it goes over familiar ground on both sides of the question. Other points are hewer, such as his own effort to admit to the Conference only those who accepted.such a definition-of the phrase &quot;without annexations or indemnities&quot; as ^culd fcer-tainly exclude the German Llajority Socialists.    As this proved in-acceptable to the Bussians he end his colleagues at the later Con-ference in Peris agreed to waive it on condition that full oppcr-tunity were given at the Conference for the discussion of the res-ponsibility for the war.     That is a first point:   and with it he is in favour of going to Stockholm.     For though he admits that the definition which he would havo preferred of the objects of gcing there was abandoned in favour of the one submitted by M. Renaudel, be considers that the latter, which was almost unanimously adopted by the party, gives him all ho wants.     It asserts that the party does not go to Stockholm to seek for a peace of compromise:   it goes there to demand a condemnation of the governments who brought about the war in 1914 and to demand that all socialists should work against them: and it demands a decision as to whether those who do not do this can remain members of the International.But this part of his speech, however, is net the most personal nor^perhaps the most important.     That is rather to be locked for when he makes his appeal against war-weariness and expectations of a peace to be found at Stockholm.     &quot;Some people,&quot; he says, &quot;say that if the Socialists go to Stockholm they may bring back proposals of peace which they can press on the Governments and so deliver hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen from death.     I see some of you applaud that. &apos;ell, I tell you frankly that any such idea is a grave and dangerous mistake.     The Conference will not, and cannot, give us immediate peace,     I implore you to fight against that fatal dream.     Consider the consequences the prevalence of such an idea flight havo.     7e co-nnot
go to Stockholm to aim at any peace by compromise, at finding some equivocal formula in support of which we are to put pressure on our Government.     If we were to do so, our action would at once render it impossible for the German Socialists to put any pressure on their Government and we should have allowed ourselves to fall into a trap ( nous jouerions un jeu de dupes).&quot;    And in a later portion of his speech, of which we have not yet received the full text, he added that so long as the Germans were on French soil and unless and until the French Government, having driven them out, entered u^cn an Im-perialistic policy the Socialists ought to act with the Government and no objection ought to be raised to his remaining in the Ministry, &quot;Whatever the military situation we must not relax our efforts. If we were to allow tt to be thought that we cannot break through, German Imperialism would at once profit by our discouragement and turn it to our disaster.&quot;      He further warned his hearers against expecting any revolution in Germany and told them the only thing to think of at present is how best to attack German Imperialism by every means of propaganda and diplomacy, and cn the field of battle. The&quot;International&quot; he concluded, &quot;was founded on two ideas, thco of peace and of right.   Before the war we washed fcr the first; now, after the brutal aggression of Germany, we can only be guided by the other - that of Right.&quot;Everyone will hope that these words will have a good effeot throughout the country and that the Stockholm business may net lead to      Thomas&apos; resignation.     He is known to be anxious to remain; but his position is obviously difficult in view of the issue be-tween his party and the Cabinet.     It is certain that M.Ribot,rif, as seems likely, he remains for the present Prime Minister, will not part with 1:1. Thcma3 if he can avoid it.     If they part ccm/nany it will be by the action of others, as to which it is for the moment impossible to prophesy.     However, whatever happens about
-7-M. Thomas, it is generally believed that when M. ?.ibot faces Parliament again it will be with a rearranged Cabinet, from which others besides Admiral Lacaze (who lately resigned) will have disappeared.     A correspondent who is in an exceptionally good position for judging of the current of French Parliamentary opinion thinks it most likely that not only II. Malvy but also M. Yivianl, who in some degree shared the responsibilities which produced !.!. Clemenceau&apos;s violent attack in the Senate and in his paper, will have been eliminated curing the recess.     If this should turn cut to be the case it will be absolutely open war with the Caillaux faction whoso representative Malvy has been. But though some people think that M. Ribot has improved hiB posi-tion by the somewhat stronger line he has taken of late, as by his bold acceptance of the Socialist challenge about the secret itussian treaty which he would have published if the Russians had se4; consented, and more reoently by the arrest of Almereyda, the editor of the suppressed&quot;Bonnet Rouge&apos;,&apos; and tho further suspension of Caillaux&apos;3 latest paper, the weekly &quot;Lea Nations&quot;, yet a definite breach with the large faction which supports Malvy in the Chamber would appear to be difficult.     Better Malvy in a iiibot Cabinet than the fall of rdbot if there is the smallest danger of what is much talked of in Paris, the return of Cail-laux to power.     But it is difficult to think that this is much more than the usucl alarmist gossip of Paris.     The best opinion now is that if M. ^ibot for any reason resigns he would be suo-ceeded by II. Painlevd&apos;, for whom the Session has on the whole been a series of successes.     The advent of Caillaux would of course be the beginning of the end, and it is surely impossible, in view of the interesting fact that the very pro-German Berlin correspondent of the Madrid A.B.C. has naively announced that statesmen who have been conducting the war are not the best for arranging peace and that as Jethmann-Hollweg has disappeared in
in Germany, so changes should be made in the Allied countries * 30 as to rip fee way for Giolitti in Italy and in Prance for an unnamed statesman who hjas shewn he can work with Germany, and who i3 of course Caillaux.     In vain surely is the net spread quite so openly as this.Meanwhile, though the arrest end mysterious death in prison of his friend Almereyda ccm scarcely help Caillaux&apos;s pro-poganda, the &quot;malaise&quot; throughout the country which he promotes by every means in his power, and on which he evidently places his principal reliance, undoubtedly continues.     It is easy to exag-gerate it, and when an English observer quotes with great alarm the saying of a banker &quot;it would be a good thing for the country if the Palais Bourbon was burned down&quot; one would ask him where he has lived in England if he has not often heard people say that it would be no great disaster if the House of Commons took a rest for a few years.&apos;     All Parliaments, and indeed most other governing bodies, are exposed to these amenities.     But they may not mean much more in Prance than in England.     Still, while the provinces are much less disturbed than Paris, there is no doubt that high prices, war weariness, and general disappointment have led everywhere to a certain increased readiness to listen to arguments in favour of the wrong sort of peace, nnd, among some of the workmen, to revolutionary talk.     More especially the women, for whom the war has brought not only losses of those dear to them, but new conditions of life involving temptations to drink and immorality, are impatient at. the delay in ending the war;   so that even very respectable peasant ^omen, on whom the burden both of losses and labours has above all fallen, are heard te utter very revolutionary sentiments.     The peasant, less influential &quot;fith the politicians than the to^m workman, has been made to bear the main military burden;   and his wife at home, and he in the trenches, both resent it.
Tlitsa are real dangers.     And Caillaux and his agents are un-deubtealy working upon thorn.     All is fish that comes into his not.cIt is said that ho has managed - it is difficult to see how - to sake his 3*aioe popular among the rural clergy.    But still it re-mains true that Prance will not call in Caillaux till She has dee-paired of the right sort of peace.     And she is far from being thero yot.    Hot even the extremest Socialists have yet shewn any sign of abandoniag the alaim to Alsace-Lorraine, though they have made of fare to submit the question to a plebiscite after it has been re-united tt-  ranee.    All reports point to a greatly improved state of things in the Army;   and doubts and fears among the oivilian population would soon give away in the faoe of visible viotory at tho front.Meaawhilo it is interesting to note that the Russian defeats neve led the Temps   to recognise very frankly the abselute necessity - &quot;the permanent and increasing neoessity&quot; - of the alliance witlc. England.     perhaps the Prime Minister&apos;s speeok at his breakfast to the Paris Journalists may have further enlightened them not only as to its neossslty but as to tho prodigious servioes it has rendered to Prance.     But so far as I have observed, except some generous comments in the right spirit from M. Clemenceait, the speech, when reported at all, was printed with little or no comment.     Even H the striking facts and figures given by Mr Lloyd-George ought to have some effect.     But the truth is that tho Frenoh are still too much inclined to regard their own efforts and sacrifices as heroic, and those of other peoples as a matter of course.     &amp;ne cannot fer a moment deny the splednour of Freneh patriotism:   there is probably a peculiarly enthusiastic quality about it not found elsewhere;   an Englishman for instance has no cry that msans to him what &quot;Vive la Franco&quot; means to a Frenchman.     But it would be better if at thi^ mo-mcnt Fre^ohmsH realised a little more that they are in this war be-
cause they had to be in it, while Britain, Italy and the United States are in it because they chose to be.Ji C.B.
