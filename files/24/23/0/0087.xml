War Cabinet. Gas.1amoraflduia by Secretary of State, for War.74t^ith reference is War Cabinet 198, minute 4, I submit for the information of the War Cabinet the subjoined note by the Master General of the Ordnance.20.8.17.(Sd.)   Derby.1.   The present position as regards fillings of Artillery Gas shell, 4-inch Stakes bombs and Livens drums is as follows.j.&apos;he fillings are of two kindsLachrymatory and Lethal.LAChHYioATOHY.K.S.K. - a powerful lachrymator, not quite, but verynearly as efficient as the German lachrymator, over which it has the advantage that it can be filled into steel shell without the use of glass or porcelain lining.S.K.     - Vfoich is K.S.K. mixed with alcohol.     It isslightly less powerful than K.S.K,, and is being superseded by the latter.LETHAL.Of these there are several fillings in use.C.G.     - (Phosgene) a highly lethal substance with delayed action.     Suitable for use only in Cast Iron Shell or Bombs, or in drums-.    For this reason it cannot be used in Artillery Shell, as Cast Iron shell are at present only in the design and trial stage.C.B.R.&apos;- (a mixture of C.G, and other substances)Same lethal characteristics as C.G., though ina slightly less degree.Is used in Artillery Shell,V.K.f^  - a Prussic Acid nixture. highly lethal substanceimmediate in its effects when in high concentration.Between these two classes isP.8.     - which has both lethal and lachrymatory effects, although it is neither highly lethal nor a powerful lachryraator.2.     The trend of research during the last few months has been in the direction of increasing the lethal effects of the existing substances in use and of obtaining mixtures which willpenetrate the German Ilask, whilst being stopped by our own.-The following new fillings are being introduced.P.G.
P.G,   - (A mixture of P.S. and C.G.)     A highly lethal filling with delayed lethal action, also lachrymatory to a certain extent.     It penetrates the German Ilaek but is stopped by our own.N.C.  .p- A fixture of P,S. with another substance which gives it the property of penetrating the German ..ask.     The mixture has proved on trial to be highly lethal.     The S.B.R. gives complete protection.C.B.R. Lark IIA mixture of C.B.R. with the same substance used in ii,C,This, it is believed from the results of trials with grenades filled C,B*R, ; ark II will penetrate the German i.,ask equally as well as i;.C.     Further trials are in hand to ascertain this point. If trials are satisfactory C.B,R. iiark II will replace C,B,R,All the above mixtures can be used in steel Bhell or bombs.A.K,   - A mixture of Prussic acid and K.S,K.     Highlylethal.     A.K. is suitable for use in Cast Iron shell or bombs.theseP.G,   - plant is not yet ready, filling will begin at end of August,A.K,   - Can only be used in Cast Iron bombs.     The supply of these has been temporarily stopped owing to defects in the bomb castings.     It will start again in six weeks.A.K. filling can then be begun.     Filling plant is now ready.if.C.   - 20,000 bombs have already been filled, 1,500 have left Assembling btation, en route for France,     A continuous supply of 1:.C. bombs will now be available.Progress as regards supply is shown in the attached table.
