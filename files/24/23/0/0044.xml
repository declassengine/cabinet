[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1917.SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION, 12.With the exception of the submarine lattack on trade there haVe been no operations ofimportance during the week.Submarine Attack on Trade.THE following table shows the number of ships sunk by submarines and mines during each of the last four weeks. The average works out at 17.5 large ships per week, compared with 21 during the June period of heavy sinkings: 	British Ships.		Week ending-			Allied and			Neutral Vessels.	Over 1,600 tons.

Similarly, with regard to the sudden fall in the percentage on the inward Gibraltar route during the week ending the 5th August.The losses of the past week were distributed in the following areas : North Sea, 5; North and West of Scotland, 3; Bay of Biscay and Spanish coast, 2 each; Channel, South and West of Ireland, and off the Cape of Good Hope, 1 each. The ship lost off the Cape has presumably been sunk by one of the mines laid by the [649-12] B

This is the first time one of the ocean convoys has lost a ship by enemy action. Out of twenty ships convoyed from Gibraltar, one was sunk by collision with the escort and one by ramming an object which might have been a submarine.From the 13th August all outward-bound British ships with a speed of thirteen knots and under have been deflected to various British ports, where they will be formed into convoys and escorted through the submarine zone by the outgoing escorts.The intention is to bring all the outward trade under convoy as soon as possible, and to continue as long as weather conditions permit.The question of reorganising the convoys in the Mediterranean, in view of increased coal traffic to Italy, will be considered by the new British Commander-in-Chief on arrival at Malta, in conjunction with the French and Italian authorities.Cruise of the Submarine &quot; Deutschland.&quot;The German submarine.&quot; Deutschland,&quot; armed with two 5.9-inch guns, has been at work in the vicinity of the Azores for over two months.

It is not certain that another submarine may not be operating with her in the same area.The importance of the foregoing information lies in the fact that it should help us to prepare for the advent of the new enemy submarine cruisers. It is believed that six of these will be ready for service shortly. Like the &quot; Deutschland,&quot; they are armed with 5.9-inch guns and are possessed of great fuel endurance, but they will probably have a much higher surface speed, and will therefore be able to make more effective use of their powerful armaments.raider &quot; Wolf &quot;in January of this year. She is the fourth ship sunk by mines in that particular area.Of the nineteen or twenty large submarines estimated to be out during the week, only,six or seven have been operating to the westward of the British Isles, the remainder being on passage to or from Germany.During the week twenty-four encounters have been reported with enemy submarines, and in one of these it is hoped that the destroyer &quot; Oracle &quot; sunk a submarine by ramming.There was considerable mine-laying activity on the East Coast of England at the beginning of the week: 
Apart from offensive measures to destroy the submarines before they reach their areas of operations, it appears that this new development of the submarine campaign can only be met by escorting all ocean trade with warships or heavily armed merchantmen. The difficulty of providing these is, however, well known. The fact that none of the neutral ships managed to escape illustrates the additional risks run by unarmed neutral shipping. As a large proportion of our trade&apos; is carried in neutral bottoms, its protection by convoy or other means becomes more and more urgent as the curve of available tonnage approaches the danger limit.The following table shows the number of merchant vessels fitted for defensive armament and guns available for same as on the 4th August: Types of * Gun.

During the last four weeks no enemy ships have arrived at, and only eight have left Rotterdam, compared with fifty-six and forty-eight respectively in the month of June.This trade, which mainly consists of coal and coke, is of great importance to the enemy, for in exchange he obtains iron ore, &amp;c, from Scandinavia, and relieves his heavily-taxed railways. Up till April, 1917, the above trade was carried on in neutral ships, and reliable information indicates that the enemy now intends to revert to that means of transport. In fact, two neutral ships have already left Rotterdam with German coal, seven are loading and eight more are being chartered.Minor Operations.During the week, some of the Grand Fleet light cruiser squadrons and destroyers have been patrolling the Norway-Shetland area on the look-out for a suspected raider. The destroyer &quot; Oracle,&quot; as stated above, rammed an enemy submarine when engaged on this duty.Minelaying operations have been carried out near Horns Reef, combined with&apos; a search by light cruisers off the Danish coast for enemy minesweepers and patrol vessels.On the 12th August enemy aeroplanes bombed Southend, &amp;c. This is the seventh daylight air raid in the last ten weeks. The average numbers of enemy aeroplanes and losses per raid are seventeen and two respectively, but against these figures must be set the loss of several of our own machines.by accident, &amp;c. These raids may not be of direct military importance, but indirectly they immobolize aeroplanes, personnel and guns.During the last three months, the machines of the R.N.A.S. have carried out no less than 40 raids on places of military importance in Belgium, most of them by moonlight, without the loss of a single machine.Summary of Naval Intelligence Movement of German Merchant Ships.To and from Norwegian ports:  Arrived, 9; left, 13.To and from Rotterdam : Arrived, 1 (with coal from Rhine); left, nil.

Denmark.Beports as to enemy minefields having been laid in Danish territorial waters, at the southern entrance to the Great Belt, have recently been confirmed by a German patrol boat which warned a Danish vessel that the passage to the southern end of the Island of Langeland at the entrance to the Great Belt was obstructed by mines.Presumably the object of these mines is to prevent British submarines entering the Baltic through Danish territorial waters.China.Now that China has declared war against the Central Powers, Japan will recommission river gunboats on the Yang-tsze, and may send a gunboat to Cantor!. Three American gunboats and two river gunboats are being commissioned at Shanghai. One French gunboat and four river gunboats are in Chinese inland waters.China has two light cruisers, three small destroyers and two gunboats, all less than six years old. The efficiency of both ships and personnel is, as far as known, very low. It is difficult to see where they could be used, though it would flatter the Chinese to do so.There is a large supply of untrained sea personnel, well accustomed to work in boats and small sailing vessels. The use of Chinese river craft, and especially fiver-craft personnel, on the waterways in Mesopotamia is worth consideration.Messrs. Vickers have a scheme to render the yards at Shanghai efficient. The principal difficulty is the supply of raw material. The Naval Attache, Peking, has reported on the scheme, and his reports have been referred to the Director of Transports and Shipping.Naval Staff, August 15, 1917.
