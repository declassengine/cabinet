g.T.1791. WAR CABINET.SECRET. TRIBUNALS AND MEDICAL BOARDS - SCOTLAND.***********1.      So far as Scotland is concerned-I concur in all respects with Mr Long&apos;s memo (.G.T.-1716)&apos;- of the 14th August.2.     Local Government Authorities in Scotland naturally look to the Scottish Office as the source from which Tribunals are to receive regulations and circulars seeing that that Office is the principal Department of Civil Government for Scotland and exercises even wider powers than belong to the Local Government Board in England-and Wales.The Appeal Tribunals are appointed on.the recommendation of the Secretary for Scotland, who has. secured in each instance for the important office of Chairman a trained lawyer in the person of the-Sheriff. &apos; .      , ; -   .It is indisputable that no other authority could carry the same weight in this matter &quot;both with Local Authorities and with Appeal Tribunals. &quot;  - .3..     The system has worked well and arrangements made with the Local Government Board have secured excellent, coordination between England and Wales and Scotland.-   Inevitably friction has occurred be-tween different Tribunals and between Tribunals and the Recruiting Authorities and other Departments..    In such cases both the recognised position of the Secretary for Scotland and the. fact that he occupies an independent position between the Tribunals and the various Departments have contributed greatly to his ability to settle disputes.: . ,4.     Such disputes tend to become more frequent and acute as the pressure for recruits inoreases and greater difficulty and hardship occur in getting them.   Tension already exists in some districts: and it would be dangerous to associate, the Tribunals with a new Department especially with one whose primary function i3 necessarily to get men Sfor.the Forces.5*   .. The control of Medical Boards in Scotland should it is thought, be transferred to the Secretary for Scotland.Scottish Office. ROBERT MUNRO.21st August, 1917.
