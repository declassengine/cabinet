Sir Archibald Hurray^ Despatch.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for War.1/Mediterranean/l317.The attached Despatch deals with operations of the Egypt Expeditionary Force from 1st March to 28th June, 1917, which covers the period up to Sir&quot;A. Murray&apos;s departure.   It has &quot;been read through &quot;by the General Staff who have marked passages -indicated in red ink - which it is inadvisable for military reasons to.make public.     The appendices also would be omitted.The first paragraph, however, touches questions of policy, and I wish to receive the directions of the Cabinet in regard to its publication.I ought to add that Sir A.Murray has seen me, and has said that, while ready to meet the Cabinet&apos;s wishes in the matter of publication, he thinks that, in justice to himself, the Despatch as written should remain an official record.DERBY.14th August, 1917,
SECRET.l2l/Medn.JlSl7.From the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Egyptian Expeditionary Force, to the Secretary of State for War, War Office, London, S. W.General Headquarters,Egyptian Expeditionary Force, 28th June, 1917.My Lord.I have the honour to submit a report on the operations of the Force under my command from 1st March to 28th June, 1917.1. Before entering into a detailed account of the operations during this period, the main events of which were the enemy&apos;s voluntary retirement from his position at Weli Sheikh Nuran and the two battles in front of Gaza, I think it necessary to point out that the policy of the War Cabinet, as communicated to me in instructions from the War Office, underwent several changes between the end of 1916 and April, 1917.   In October, 1916. I was informed that the policy in Egypt was to be mainly defensive, w.o. letter though it was hoped that all preparations were being made for an advance on El Arish. ^(g5^51&apos; With this policy, including the plan of occupying, if possible, El Arish, I agreed, though j^yletter, I stated at the same time that my previous estimate of the number of troops necessary No. G.s.z./ for holding and operating from El A.rish namely, five divisions and at least four ^iao. 16. mounted brigades still held good, but that with the four divisions then at my disposal, the 42nd, 52nd, 53rd and 54th, I was prepared to defend Egypt and undertake the advance on El Arish.    This advance, as I reported in my despatch of 1st March, 1917, was successfully accomplished by the end of December.Meanwhile, early in the month of December, I was asked by telegram to send my W.O. tele-proposals for action beyond El Arish, and to state the additional troops which I should IS^cipher, require to carry them out; and it was pointed out to me that the gaining of a military 9.12.16. success in this theatre was very desirable.   In my reply I asked that two divisions My telegram, might be sent to me, and, if possible, some more mounted troops.   A further telegram ^0A&apos;iL was sent to me on 12th December, instructing me to make the maximum effort possible 10.12.is. during the winter, and inquiring when the two divisions for which 1 had asked would w.o. tele-be required.   I replied that, while I was prepared to attempt the advance to Rafa with      ^&apos;her only four divisions, I considered that one additional division was now necessary to 12.12.16. ensure security and to hold, and operate from, El Arish thus once more repeating my My teie-oiiginal estimate- that five divisions would be required for this purpose and that AJtf.&apos;i389, another division would be needed, not before 15th February, for a further advance from I3.i2.i6. Rafa towards Palestine.   At the same time I forwarded in detail the plan on which I My letter, have since worked for my further advance along the sea coast into Palestine.   The next f^f&apos; communication which I received (dated 15th December) indicated that the War Cabinet 13.12.16. were not prepared to give me the troops asked for.   I was informed that, nctwith- w.o. tele-standing recent instructions to make the maximum effort possible during the winter,       cipher, my primary mission was the defence of Egypt, and that I should be notified if and15-12-1^ when the War Cabinet changed this policy.   I was further informed that no more mounted troops could be sent, and that the possibility of my getting two more divisions depended on whether they could be released from another theatre of war.   No further indications of policy were given me till after the occupation of El Arish, but early in January it appeared that the War Cabinet had decided to make everything subsidiary to the concentration of strong forces in France.   A telegram of 11th January informed w.o. teie-me that the War Cabinet had decided that, as the general situation would not permit      ^?-,ier of sending out the reinforcements for which I had asked, the undertaking of any 11.1.17. operations in Palestine on a large scale should be postponed until the autumn, and that, while preparing for this campaign during the summer, I was to be ready to release one or two divisions for France.   A few days later definite instructions arrived to send a w.o. teie-division to France, acting on which I withdrew the 42nd Division then the best in my fj^Ei&apos;^?&apos;, force forthwith, and it sailed early in March.   This indication of a changed policy was 22.i.T7!PKr&apos; confirmed by a letter of 11th January, in which I was informed of the acceptance by wo. letter the War Cabinet in principle of an autumn campaign in Palestine and instructed that JJ7fPROOF 2.-(B17/473)   20  8/17  H&amp;S  4831wo
my primary mission after the occupation of Rafa was the defence of Egypt during the summer months and the preparation for an offensive campaign in the autumn.   In reply t!&apos;f&apos;1, to this, I again stated that I adhered to my estimate of the need of five divisions to safeguard Egypt, hold El Arish and protect the Suez Canal.Between the end of January and the end of March, though I was now reduced to three infantry divisions, I made every effort as far as possible to keep up the offensive. Owing to the satisfactory state of affairs in the Canal defences and in the West, I was now able to employ all three of my divisions on the Eastern front, to concentrate all my mounted troops in two mounted divisions, and to commence the formation of the 74th Division from the dismounted Yeomanry brigades in the force. Several months, however, were bound to elapse before this division could be completely equipped, efficiently trained and supplied with its full complement of divisional troops. Early in March, to my disappointment, the enemy, whom I had every hope of successfully attacking in his position at Weli Sheikh Nuran, evacuated this position before our troops were within reach of him. It was to prevent a repetition of these tactics and to bring the Turks to fight that I determined to attack the Gaza position as soon as possible, considering that the advantage of thus exerting pressure on the enemy and possibly taking Gaza by a coup de main, would outweigh the risk of making the attack in a waterless counfay considerably in advance of railhead.Though the coup de main just failed, the military results of the first battle of Gaza, in my opinion, justified my anticipations.   The enemy was brought to fight, losing heavily in killed and wounded, and the advance of the railway to Wadi Ghuzze was assured.   It was at this time, the end of March, when the hitherto adverse situation in Mesopotamia was rapidly changing in our favour, that the War Cabinet &apos; i -   again changed the policy in this theatre.   In a telegraphic communication dated 30th ripjier March, I was instructed, in view of the altered situation, to make my object the defeat of the Turks south of Jerusalem and the occupation of Jerusalem.   I replied, drawing ;^ra,n&apos; attention once more to my never-varying estimate of the troops required, that a rapid 31.3.17. advance could not be expected unless I were fortunate enough to inflict a severe blow on the enemy, and that heavy fighting with considerable losses would have to be expected if the Turks held, as I anticipated, a series of strong positions between the Gaza Bir Saba and the Jerusalem Jaffa lines.   After consideration of this reply by ;ie-   the War Cabinet, I was informed that the War Cabinet relied on me to pursue the enemy with all the rapidity compatible with the necessary progress of my communica-tions, and was anxious that I should push my operations with all energy, though at the &apos; same time no additional troops were to be sent to me, since it was considered that, in view of the military situation of the enemy, my present force would suffice.   At that time, as always, I had fully appreciated the importance of offensive operations in this theatre, and, having failed to take Gaza by a coup de main, I was anxious to take it, if possible, by more deliberate operations before the enemy was further reinforced, chiefly on account of its water supply.   I was therefore ready, as I stated at the time, to attack Gaza with my present force before the end of April, and had good hopes, provided the enemy was not heavily reinforced, of capturing that town.The second battle of Gaza took place between the 17th and 20th April. I succeeded in pushing on to within a mile or two of the town, but was unable to take the key^ of the position, Ali Muntar. The enemy force in front of me was then five divisions, with considerably increased numbers of Austrian and German gunners and machine gunners, and it was abundantly clear that, owing to the relaxation of pressure further east, the Turks had been able to reinforce their units heavily from depdts in the north of Palestine.When, therefore, after the second battle of Gaza, I was asked to state my require-ments for a continuation of the offensive, I replied that my estimate of five fully equipped and complete divisions still held good, whereas at present I had only three considerably depleted by recent fighting, one just formed and incompletely trained, and six battalions the majority far from fit towards the formation of a fifth division. My requirements therefore were two complete divisions and enough field artillery to complete all divisions to normal scale. With the troops which I had at the time I could hope for no more than a local success. In view of this position and the inability of the Ptussian Army in the Caucasus to relieve the pressure, the War Cabinet decided to change the policy, and at the end of April I was informed that Jerusalem was no longer my objective, but that my mission for the present was to take favourable opportunity of defeating the Turkish forces opposed to me and to follow up any success gained with all the means at my disposal. To this task I devoted my energies throughout the month of May, during which time I was engaged in broadening my front by laying down&apos; pncr,No.
branch railway and pipe lines from Rafa eastwards and south-eastwards to the Wadi Ghuzze, so that I might eventually effectually threaten Bir Saba and the railway north of that place. ^ Thanks to the unremitting labour of all concerned, in spite of immense difficulties, these preparations are now well advanced, and we are now in a position to take the offensive in any part of the line from Gaza to Bir Saba, though the date of the offensive must depend upon when my deficit of about 9,000 infantry can be made good by drafts, and when reinforcements can arrive from Salonika.It would be of interest, as this is my last despatch, to review shortly here how the Egyptian Expeditionary Force has varied in strength between the beginning of 1916 and the present time.At the end of January, 1916, besides a small portion of the 46th Division, there were in Egypt, either in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force or in the Force in Egypt, the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division, three mounted Yeomanry brigades, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade and three double companies Bikanir Camel Corps, 11 infantry divisions (including the Australian and New Zealand troops), one Indian infantry division, three dismounted Yeomanry brigades, two Territorial infantry brigades, two brigades of 60-prs. and the equivalent of three brigades of siege artillery, besides garrison battalions and other minor units. The South African Infantry Brigade subsequently arrived in this country.Between this time and the end of May&apos; 1916, six complete divisions at full strength, three infantry brigades and nine batteries of heavy and siege artillery, besides certain signal, engineer and medical units, were embarked for service in other theatres. Meanwhile, the 4th and 5th Australian Divisions had been formed, the dismounted Yeomanry organized in four brigades, six companies of the Imperial Camel Corps raised and trained and the Camel Transport Corps raised to a strength of 18,000. So that in May the Force in Egypt having now been amalgamated with&apos; the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, the following were the principal components of the force : One mounted division, three mounted Yeomanry brigades, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade (less one regiment), six companies Imperial Camel Corps, six companies Bikanir Camel Corps, seven infantry divisions, four dismounted brigades, seven battalions of Indian infantry, three batteries of 60-prs.During June and July, 1916, the 4th and 5th Australian Divisions, and the 11th Division, embarked for France, thus bringing the total number of troops sent out of the country since January to 232,000, not including medical units. Between this time and the end of February, 1917, no material change took place in the composition of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, save that three further companies Bikanir Camel Corps arrived ; additional companies of the Camel Corps were raised (the total number of companies is now 18), the Camel Transport Corps was also considerably increased, and the Egyptian Labour Corps, the recruitment of which had begun early in 1916, had reached a total of nearly 50,000.During the period covered by this report the 42nd Division has sailed for France, the 74th Division has been formed from three of the dismounted brigades (one having been previously disbanded), with the necessary divisional troops; the 75th Division has been formed from battalions that have arrived from India and elsewhere and Indian infantry battalions. The arrival of an additional mounted brigade from Salonika has enabled me to reorganize my mounted troops into three mounted divisions, each of three mounted brigades. One more mounted brigade and the 60th Division are in process of arrival from Salonika, and reinforcements of heavy artillery (some of which have already arrived) are en route, So that at the present the composition of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, allowing for reorganization now actually in progress, is : Three mounted divisions (each of three brigades), four infantry divisions, one further infantry division in process of formation and one division en route, 18 companies Imperial Camel Corps, nine companies Bikanir Camel Corps, with a tenth now in process of formation ; six batteries of 60-prs., two siege batteries and a prospective total of 1\ siege batteries of heavy howitzers. In other words, the present fighting units of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, when all advised reinforcements have arrived, will form the equivalent of one cavalry corps and two infantry corps, with the necessary artillery.Having thus summarized these main developments of policy and variations of strength, I now proceed to the m .re detailed narrative.2. At the beginning of March the Eastern Force, under tho command of Lieut.-General Sir Charles Dobell, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., was concentrated in the neigh-bourhood of El Arish. The headquarters of the Desert Column, under the command of Lieut-General Sir P. Chetwode, Bt., K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O., were at Sheikh Zowaiid,. in advance of which place the mounted troops of the column were covering the con-
74struction of the railway, which was being rapidly extended along the coast towards Rafa. Our mounted patrols, as I reported in my last despatch, had on 28th February entered the village of Khan Yunus, which had been evacuated by the enemy. ^ Every preparation was being made for an attack in force on the strong position at Weli Sheikh Nuran, upon which the Turks had been working incessantly since the beginning of January. On 5th March, however, aeroplane reconnaissance established the fact that the enemy had decided not to face our attack and was evacuating this carefully prepared position. I at once instructed the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force, to do all that was possible either to prevent this evacuation or to inflict loss on the enemy during its execution, and the Royal Flying Corps were ordered to carry out bomb attach with the utmost energy against the enemy&apos;s communications. Accordingly on 6th March and the following days vigorous attacks were made by our aircraft on the railway at Bir Saba, Tel el Sheria and the junction station jon the Jerusalem Ramleh line; but it was found impossible for our infantry or mounted troops to make any effective move against the enemy, owing to the distance between railhead and Weli Sheikh Nuran. The enemy had retired while he was still out of reach, and his troops, which then consisted of about two divisions, were subsequently distributed between Gaza and Tel el Sheria, with a small garrison at Bir Saba.It thus became necessary to meet an altered situation, which was complicated by complete uncertainty as to the line on which the enemy would ultimately elect to stand, and also to decide on the method and direction of my advance into Palestine. I decided that it would in any case be unwise to make an attempt on Bir Saba, since by so doing I should be drawing my line of communications parallel to the enemy&apos;s front, and there was no technical advantage to be gained by linking up the military railway with the Central Palestine Railway, either at Bir Saba or Tel el Sheria. The true line of advance was still along the coast, since the enemy was no less effectually threatened thereby, while my line of communications was more easily protected and railway construction was more rapid, owing to the absence of gradients. The coastal district, too, was better supplied with water. I decided therefore to continue for the present a methodical advance up the coast, moving troops forward as the railway could supply them, together with energetic preparation of the force for an attack in strength as soon as the state of its communications should make that possible. The most important thing was to increase the radius and mobility of the striking force. The Desert Column was therefore reconstituted to consist of the two cavalry divisions (each less one brigade) the concentration of the Imperial Mounted Division, under Major-General H. W. Hodgson, C.V.O., C.B., being completed at Sheikh Zowaiid by 16th March  and the 53rd Division, together with two light armoured motor batteries^ Local arrangements were also made by which improvised trains, both of horses and camels, should be available for the three infantry and two cavalry divisions in the Eastern Force. At the same.timerthe-Imperial Camel-Corps-Brigade was constituted as^an,independent unit oLthree battalions, Imperial Camel Corps, with a proportion of brigade troops, including thejlong Kong and Singapore Battery, and the three infantry brigades which had been formed^out of the dismounted yeomanry regiments were -combined into the 74th Division, under the-command of Major-General E. S.jGirdwood. This division, however, had no artillery or other divisional troops; Jts-dSfigades had to be gradually collected from different parts of Egypt, and it^needed a period of divisional training before it could take its place beside the,.thre&quot;e other infantry divisions in the force. Its headquarters arrived at El Arish.,on-&apos;6&apos;th Marchflndjts first brigade at the same place on 8th March. I was engjded to form this division by^the^continued quietness of the Western front, wjijch^made it possible to amalgamate the Delta District and Western Force into^ne^command, which was entrusted to Brigadier-GeheraL II. G. Casson, (lM.Gr^md to garrison the posts on the Western front entirely with garrison-battalions, light- aiTnoured-motor-batterdes-au^^3. By the middle of the month the railway had reached Rafa. and the work of making a large station there with the requisite sidings was being rapidly pushed on. The Desert Column was between Rafa and Sheikh Zowaiid, the 52nd Division was at Sheikh Zowaiid and the 54th Division between that place and El Arish. There were distinct indications that the enemy intended to withdraw his troops without a fight from the Gaza-Tel el Sheria-Bir Saba line, a move which it was highly important to prevent, while it was necessary to seize the line of the Wadi Ghuzze in order to protect the advance of the railway from Rafa towards Gaza. The chief difficulty lay in deciding, in view of these considerations, the exact moment when it would be wise to abandon the methodical advance and to push out to its full radius of action a.considerable force, into a country bare of all supplies and almost devoid of water. I came to the conclusion
that it would be necessary to push forward the Desert Column as soon as it could be supplied from Rafa Station, and the two other infantry divisions could be maintained in support of it between Rafa and the Wadi Ghuzze. It appeared that these conditions would be fulfilled shortly before the end of the month. I therefore instructed the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force, to concentrate the Desert Column about Deir el Belah, a small village to the south-west of the Wadi Ghuzze, with one of the supporting divisions on the ridge to the east of Deir el Belah and the other in the neighbourhood of Khan Yunus, with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade to cover, the right flank of the force. When these dispositions were completed the Desert Column, with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade attached, was to march on Gaza, thus giving the enemy the alternative of standing his ground and fighting or of submitting to the attacks of our cavalry on his flanks and rear should he attempt to retire.On 20th March, General Dobell moved his headquarters to Rafa, whither, on the same day, headquarters Desert Column moved from Sheikh Zowaiid. The further preliminary moves, covered by the cavalry, who on the 23rd approached very near the outskirts of Gaza, were completed without any hitch by the 25th March. By the evening of that date the whole of the Desert Column were concentrated at Deir el Belah, the 54th Division was at In Seirat under the hills to the east of Deir el Belah, the 52nd Division at Khan Yunus and the Camel Corps Brigade and armoured batteries about Abasan el Kebir. All preliminary reconnaissances had been carried out and the orders to the General Officer Commanding, Desert Column, were to advance on Gaza in the early hours of the following morning, the cavahy pushing out to the east and north of the town to block the enemy&apos;s lines of retreat, while the 53rd Division attacked Gaza in front. The 54th Division was to cross the Wadi Ghuzze in rear of the mounted troops of the Desert Column to a position of readiness in the neighbourhood of Sheikh Abbas, a commanding ridge 5 miles S.S.E. of Gaza, where a position was to be selected suitable for defence against an attack from east or south-east. One infantry brigade and one artillery brigade of this division were to assemble at a convenient point to the west of this position, where they would be held in readiness to reinforce the Desert Column at short notice. One brigade&apos; group of the 52nd Division was to be brought up to replace the 54th Division at In Seirat. The enemy&apos;s main body was in the Tel el Nejile Huj area, south of the Wadi el Hesi, covered by detachments about Gaza, Sheria Hereira and Bir Saba. His strength appeared to be between two and three divisions.The object of this advance was threefold: firstly, to seize the line of the Wadi Ghuzze to cover the advance of the railway; secondly, at all costs to prevent the enemy from retiring without a fight; thirdly, if possible,, to capture Gaza by a coup de main and to cut off its garrison.On 25th March I set up my Advanced General Headquarters at El Arish for the period of the operations, and on the following morning battle headquarters of Eastern Force were established just north of In Seirat. *4. Early in the morning of 26th March the preliminary movements were begun and successfully accomplished. The Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division left its bivouacs at 2.30 a.m. and crossed the Wadi Ghuzze, closely followed by the Imperial Mounted Division. The leading division headed for Beit Durdis, 5 miles east&apos; of Gaza, having completed its crossing of the W7adi by 6.15 a.m. The Imperial Mounted Division, after crossing the Wadi, headed due east for El-Mendur, where it arrived at 9.30. The moves of the mounted divisions, as well as of the infantry, were considerably delayed by a very dense fog, which came on just before dawn and did not entirely clear till 8 a,m. This unavoidable delay had a serious effect upon the subsequent operations. The Imperial Camel Corps Brigade crossed the Wadi Ghuzze a little further south and also proceeded to El Mendur, where its role was to assist the Imperial Mounted Division in observing the enemy in the direction of Huj and Hereira, and to withstand any attempts to relieve Gaza from those directions. At 9.30 a.m. the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division reached Beit Durdis, and pushed out detachments to the west, north and east. In the course of these movements the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade closed the exit from Gaza and rested their right on the sea. A detachment of this brigade captured the Commander of the 53rd Turkish Division, with his staff, while he was driving into Gaza ; also a convoy of 30 Turks. Later in the morning the same brigade destroyed the head of a Turkish column with machine-gun fire as it debouched from Gaza in a north-easterly direction. The Imperial Mounted Division sent out patrols towards Hereira, Tel el Sheria and Huj, while two squadrons of the 5th Mounted Brigade were placed astride the Bir Saba-Gaza road, about 5 miles south-east of Gaza, and one squadron was sent north to gain
touch with the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division. Later in the morning these squadrons found themselves engaged with enemy mounted troops, supported by bodies of infantry, and remained so throughout the day against continuously increasing numbers. They were also exposed to the fire of heavy guns at Hereira, and suffered some casualties in consequence.Meanwhile, the 53rd Division, under the command of Major-General .A. G. Dallas, C.B., C.M.G., having thrown forward strong bridge heads before dawn, crossed the Wadi Ghuzze at a point some 3 miles from the sea coast, with the 158th Brigade on the right directed on the Mansura Ridge, and the 160th Brigade on the left directed on El Sheluf, some 2 miles south of Gaza on the ridge running south-west from that place. The 159th Brigade was held in reserve and crossed in rear of 158th Brigade. The Gloucestershire Hussars, with a battalion and a section of 60-prs., crossed the Wadi near the sea coast, and for the remainder of the day successfully carried out their role of working up the sandhills to cover the left of the 53rd Division, and to keep the enemy employed between the village of Sheikh Ahmed and Gaza. At the same time the divisional squadron secured a good gun position and an excellent observation station for another section of 60-prs. on the far side of the Wadi Ghuzze, in the neighbourhood of the main road from Gaza to Khan Yunus. The 54th Division, under the command of Major-General S. W. Hare, C.B., began to cross the Wadi at 7 a.m, and the 162nd and 163rd Brigades proceeded to take up a defensive position on the Sheikh Abbas Ridge, south-east of Gaza. These brigades remained in their positions throughout the day without coming into action. The 161st Brigade, with a brigade of field artillery, remained in the vicinity of the Wadi, so as to be at the disposal oi the General Officer Commanding, 53rd Division, when required. During the morning this brigade was ordered to Mansura, to come under the orders of General Officer Commanding, 53rd Division, and it finally assembled at that point about 3.30 in the afternoon. After the preliminary reconnaissances had been completed, the 53rd Division commenced to deploy from the line El Sheluf Mansura, to attack the Ali Muntar position, with the following objectives : The 160th Brigade astride the El Sheluf Ali Muntar Ridge on the enemys south-western defences; the 158th Brigade moving north from Mansura on the prominent Ali Muntar Ridge on the southern outskirts of the town; and the 159th Brigade, less one battalion in divisional reserve, pivoting on the right of the 158th Brigade on the hill 1,200 yards north-east of Ali Muntar, in co-operation with the attack of the 158th Brigade. The deployment of the 160th and 158th Brigades commenced at 11.50 a.m., and the 159th Brigade moved forward shortly afterwards to its assigned position. In co-operation with artillery fire and long-range machine-gun fire, the 160th Brigade pressed forward along the ridge, and the 158th and 159th Brigades over the flat, open ground, practically devoid of cover. The final advance, which began just after 1 p.m., was very steady, and all the troops behaved magnificently, though the enemy offered a very stout resistance, both with rifle and machine-gun fire, and our advancing troops, during the approach march, the deployment and attack, were subjected to a heavy shrapnel fire.About 1 p.m., General Officer Commanding, Desert Column, decided to throw the whole of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division against the north and north-east.of Gaza to assist the infantry. Both mounted divisions were placed under the orders of Major-General Sir H. G. Chauvel, K.C.M.G., C.B., General Officer Commanding, Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division, with instructions that he should bring the Imperial Mounted Division further north to continue observing the enemy, while the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade was ordered to conform to this movement and observe the country from the right of the Imperial Mounted Division. About the same time, considerable enemy activity was observed on the roads leading north and east of Tel elSheria and also about Hereira. By 3.30 p.m., General Chauvel had collected his division, with the exception of some detachments not yet relieved, and had commenced to move on Gaza, together with the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade from the Imperial Mounted Division. The attack was made with the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade on the right, with its right flank on the sea, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade in the centre directed on the continuation of the Ali Muntar Ridge and the 22nd Mounted Brigade, less one detachment, on the left, east of the town.5. Meanwhile, the infantry attack was being pressed with great vigour, and by 4.30 p.m. considerable progress had been made. Portions of the enemy positions were already in our hands and shortly afterwards the Ali Muntar Hill, a strong work known as the Labyrinth, and the ground in the immediate neighbourhood, fell into our hands. The Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division was already exerting pressure on
the enemy, and by 5 p.m. the enemy was holding out in the trenches, and on the hill south of the Mosque only. The General Officer Commanding, 53rd Division, called on the 161st Brigade (Brigadier-General W. Marriott-Dodington), which had been placed at his disposal, to take this position. The brigade responded with the greatest gallantry in face of a heavy fire, and after some hard fighting it pushed home its attack with complete success, so that when darkness fell the whole of the Ali Muntar position had been carried and a footing gained on the ridge to a point about 1,200 yards north-east of that position. Meanwhile, during the relief of the observing detachments of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division by the Imperial Mounted Division, the enemy, pressing his advance vigorously from the east, had succeeded in dislodging our troops from a prominent position on the east of Gaza. To restore the situation on this flank, General Chauvel sent back the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade. Thanks to skilful leadership of Brigadier-General J. R. Royston, C.M.G., D.S.O., General Officer Commanding this brigade, and his promptness in taking up his position, the mounted troops, supported by horse artillery and motor batteries, were able to prevent any further advance by the enemy from this direction. The attack of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division on the north of Gaza was pushed home with the greatest dash and gallantry, in conjunction with the infantry attack. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was soon in possession of the redoubt of the ridge east of Gaza, while the 22nd Mounted Brigade on their left carried the knoll running west from that ridge. During these operations the Somerset Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, in support of the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade, silenced two enemy guns, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade captured and retained, in spite of counter-attacks, two 77-mm. guns, which they used with skill on small bodies of the enemy which were still in the occupation of houses in the vicinity. As a result, 20 prisoners were taken, and eventually the guns were safely brought away. The whole division then established itself amongst the cactus hedges on the outskirts of the town, all brigades overcoming serious difficulties in fighting their way through the cactus hedges, in spite of the stubborn resistance of the enemy. The 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade, under the command of Brigadier-General G. de L. Ryrie, C.M.G., particularly distinguishing itself in this phase of the operations.6. When darkness fell, the situation was as follows : Gaza was enveloped, and the enemy, in addition to heavy losses in killed and wounded, had lost 700 prisoners. The 53rd Division was occupying the Ali Muntar position, which it had captured, but its right flank was very much in the air, only a thin line of cavalry holding orT the relief columns of continually increasing strength which were approaching from north and east. In support of this division, the 54th Division, less one brigade, was holding Sheikh Abbas, with ifcdeft about 2^- miles from the flank of the 53rd. The Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division was very much extended round Gaza and was engaged in street fighting. The Imperial Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, on a very wide front, were endeavouring to hold off enemy forces. The majority of the mounted troops had been unable to water their horses during the day, and it appeared that, unless Gaza was captured during the day, they would have to withdraw west of the Wadi Ghuzze in order to water their animals. Strong columns of the enemy, with guns, were moving to the relief of Gaza from the north, north-east and south-east. It was at this moment that the loss of two hours&apos; daylight made itself particularly felt, since, had two more hours&apos; daylight now been available, there is no doubt that the infantry would have been able to consolidate the positions they had won, and for arrangements to have been made by which the 54th Division could have effected junction with the 53rd. It is perhaps possible that, if General Dobell had at this stage pushed forward his reserve (the 52nd Division) to support the 53rd the result would have been different, but the difficulty of supplying water for men and horses would have been immense and&apos;impossible to realize by those who were not on the spot. As it was, after consultation with General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force, the General Officer Commanding, Desert Column, in order to prevent the envelopment of his mounted troops, decided to withdraw them during the night; he therefore directed General Chauvel to break off the engagement and retire his divisions west of the Wadi Ghuzze, using the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade to assist in his retirement. This movement made the maintenance by the 53rd Division of the very exposed position which it had captured no longer possible, and General Officer Commanding, Desert Column, reluctantly ordered Genera&apos; Officer Commanding, 53rd Division, to draw back his right and gain touch on that flank with the two remaining brigades of the 54th Division, which had already been ordered by General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force, to fall back westwards from Sheikh Abbas and take up a line on the El Burjaliye Ridge.
running south-westwards from Mansura, with their left in touch with the 161st Brigade, which was to fall back from its line south of Ali Muntar and establish an outpost line further back, with its right in touch with the remainder of its division. These move-ments were carried out during the night, the 53rd and 54th Divisions converging so that their inner (or northward) flanks rested one on the other, their lines running along the El Sire and El Burjaliye Ridges respectively, the Imperial Camel; Corps Brigade closing the gap between the right of the 54th Division and the Wadi Ghuzze. The retirement of the mounted troops was accomplished without difficulty, though during the movement the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade became engaged with the enemy advancing from the direction of Huj, but succeeded in driving them off with the assistance of No. 7 Light Car Patrol. At dawn on the 27th, the 11th and 12th Light Armoured Motor Batteries found themselves in the middle of a large body of the enemy, but brilliantly extricated themselves, causing considerable casualties to the enemy.7. The withdrawal of the cavalry and the retirement of the 53rd Division on to the El Sire Ridge, enabled the enemy to reinforce the garrison of Gaza with considerable bodies of troops. At daybreak, nevertheless, reconnoitring patrols from the 160th and 161st Brigades pushed forward seized the positions up to and including the Ali Muntar Hill, which had been captured on the day before. They encountered some resistance, but drove the enemy out and established themselves on this line. At 8 a.m., the 53rd Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade passed under the direct command of General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force. As soon as the advanced parties of infantry were established in the recaptured positions, preparations were made by the General Officer Commanding, 53rd Division, to reinforce them, but before the reinforcements could reach their objective, a strong counter-attack was made by fresh Turkish troops, which were pouring in from the north aud north-east. This counter-attack drove our patrols out of the position on Ali Muntar Hill, though further advance from it on the part of the enemy was prevented by our artillery, and our infantry still held the rest of the positions. Since, however, the junction of the right of the 53rd Division and the left of the 54th made an acute salient exposed to attack on three sides, it was necessary to withdraw the line here so as to eliminate the acute angle. In addition to the Turkish reinforcements coming from the east apd north-east against Ali Muntar, another body appeared early in the morning on the Sheikh Abbas Ridge, which they occupied. From this point they directed artillery fire on the rear of our positions on the Mansura Ridge, doing a certain amount of damage among the transport animals and making any movement of camel transport during the day impossible. Our positions were also exposed to heavy artillery fire from the north. Nevertheless, though tired and ill-supplied with water, the 53rd and 54th Divisions, now placed under the command of the General Officer Commanding, 53rd Division, remained throughout the day staunch and cheerful and perfectly capable of repulsing with heavy losses to the enemy any Turkish counter-attacks. At no point was any enemy attack successful, and the Imperial Camel Corps, on the right of the 54th Division, in repulsing the attack by the 3rd Turkish Cavalry Division, practically annihilated the attackers. The position, however, was an impossible one to hold permanently. It was narrow and exposed to attack and artillery fire from three directions; also, it was devoid of water, and hostile artillery fire made the approach to it by day of slow-moving camel convoys with water and supplies impossible. If it had now been practicable for the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force, to advance with his three infantry divisions and two cavalry divisions, I have no doubt that Gaza could have been taken and the Turks forced to retire; but the re-organization of the force for a deliberate attack would have taken a considerable time, the horses of the cavalry were very fatigued, and the distance of our railhead from the front line put the immediate maintenance of such a force with supplies, water and ammunition entirely out of the question. The only alternative, therefore, was to retire the infantry, and this movement, after a strong counter-attack at 4 p.m. on the northern apex of our position had been shattered by our rifle, machine-gun and artillery fire, was carried out during the night at the order of General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force. By daylight the whole force had reached the western side of the Wadi Ghuzze and taken up a strong defensive position covering Deir el Belah. The enemy made no attempt to advance on the 28th, but contented himself with the occupation of the Gaza defences, our cavalry remaining in touch with him throughout the day. Arrangements were made on the 29th for the defensive line on the western side of the Wadi Ghuzze to be divided into sections, to be held by the 54th, 52nd and 53rd Divisions respectively, to cover the further progress of the railway which was just reaching Khin Yunus.
8. The total result of the first battle of Gaza, which gave us 950 Turkish and German prisoners and two Austrian field guns, caused the enemy losses which I estimate at 8,000 and cost us under 4,000 casualties, of which a large proportion were only slightly wounded, was that my primary and secondary objects were completely attained, but that the failure to attain the third object the capture of Gaza owing to the delay caused by fog on the 26th and the waterless nature of the country round Gaza, prevented a most successful operation from being a complete disaster to the enemy. The troops engaged, both cavalry, camelry and infantry, especially the 53rd Division and the 161st Brigade of the 54th, which had not been seriously in action since the evacuation of Suvla Bay at the end of 1915, fought with the utmost gallantry and endurance, and showed to the full the splendid fighting qualities which they possess.9. Preparations were immediately begun for a second attack in greater force on the Gaza positions as soon as possible, though I instructed the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force, that upon no consideration was a premature attack to be made. Ate-the same. timerth&amp;4itmost-expeditiomwas made -necessary-by -the^eeeipt-^-the-instructions^ from the War-Office-to-press-on towards Jerusalem, to which J have referred in my first paragraph. The station at Deir el Belah, where the headquarters of the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force, had been set up on 30th March, was opened on the 5th April, and was rapidly developed into an important railhead. At this period the activity of hostile aircraft in bombing Deir el Belah and other advanced camps considerably increased, but little damage was done and all attacks were followed by vigorous retaliation on the part of the Royal Flying Corps. The troops were all concentrated ready for an advance and reconnaissances for artillery positions east of the Wadi Ghuzze were completed early in April, but the chief factor in fixing the date of the advance was our continual source of anxiety, the water supply. It was necessary for tile next advance that two divisions should be able to water in the Wadi Ghuzze, where the prospects of obtaining water by well-sinking were small. Tanks therefore had to be set up in the Wadi, and arrangements made to pump rail-borne water from Deir el Belah over the In Seirat Ridge to fill them. These-preparations were energetic-ahy-put4n-hand-and-even^Jerntr, and excavations for three -8,000 gallon -tanks at Tel* el&quot; Jemmi were completed, while-nine-oisterns-witb-a^ were located-a-t-A-basan-el-KebirrThe general plan of the attack had by this time already been decided. It was that the advance on Gaza with three infantry divisions and two cavalry divisions should take place in two stages. The first stage would be the occupation of the Sheikh Abbas  Mansura Ridge, south of Gaza, and its preparation as a strong point from which any flank attack could easily be repelled. A short period of development was to follow the first stage, during which water supply and communications would be improved as far as possible, heavy artillery and Tanks brought up and supplies advanced, so-that the final stage an advance on Gaza after a heavy bombardment should be accomplished rapidly. Meanwhile, the enemy in front of me had been considerably reinforced, and had abandoned all intention of further retirement. It became clear that five divisions and a cavalry division had now appeared on our front with an increase in heavy artillery. Not only were the Gaza defences being daily strengthened and wired, but a system of enemy trenches and works was being constructed south-east from Gaza to the Atawineh Ridge, some 12,000 yards distant from the town. This put any encircling movement by our cavalry out of the question, unless the enemy&apos;s line in front of us could be pierced and a passage made through which the mounted divisions could be pushed. Until that could be done the role of our mounted troops would be to protect the right flank of the infantry, whose attack in the final stage was to be on the same lines as the first attack. While one division advanced from the Wadi Ghuzze between the sea and the Gaza-Deir el Belah road, the two divisions occupying the Sheikh Abbas-Mansura Ridge were to attack the south-western defences up to tho Ali Muntar Hill; the right division, after overcoming the enemy on its front, to pivot on its left against the defences north of Ali Muntar. The 17th April was fixed as the first stage of the advance, and on the 15th April I.proceeded to Khan Yunus, where I set up my Advanced General Headquarters.10. For the first stage of the operations the dispositions of the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force, were as follows :-The 52nd and 54th Divisions, the latter on the right, to seize and occupy the line Sheikh Abbas-Mansura-Kurd Hill (on the El Sire Ridge). The General Officer Commanding, 52nd Division, Major-General W. E. B. Smith, C.B., C.M.G., to command this attack. The 53rd D ivision, under the command of Major-General S. F. Mott, to remain&apos;in position just north of the Wadi
Ghuzze between the sea and the Gaza-Khan Yunus road, but to carry out strong reconnaissances northwards (along the coast, The 74th Division to remain in general reserve in the vicinity of In Seirat. Of the Desert Column, now constituted of two mounted divisions and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, one mounted division was to be disposed about Shellal with the object of immobilizing enemy forces at Hereira, while the remainder of the column was to protect the right flank of the 54th Division. The enemy was disposed in a chain of detachments along the 16 miles between Sheria and Gaza, with strong trenches at El Atawineh (about 13,000 yards south-east^of Gaza) and very strong defences, known as the Warren, the Labyrinth, Green Hill, Middlesex Hill, Outpost Hill and Lees Hill, running south-westwards along the ridge from Ali Muntar. This position, which commands all approaches to the town from the south-west, touth and south-east had been very strongly fortified and well wired, in addition to the natural obstacles formed by thick cactus hedges, had been made into a nest of machine guns, largely manned by Germans. The right of his line, between Gaza and the sea, ran in the arc of a circle west and south-west of the town. This section consisted of a double line of trenches and redoubts, strongly held by infantry and machine guns well placed and concealed in impenetratable- cactus hedges built on high mud banks enclosing orchards and gardens on the outskirts of the town.The advance began at dawn on 17th April and the Sheikh Abbas Mansura Kurd Hill position was taken by 7 a.m. with little opposition and practically no casualties, though one Tank was put out of action by direct hits from artillery. The consolidation of the position was at once begun under intermittent bursts of heavy shelling. The Desert Column fulfilled its task of protection and reconnaissance, during which a strong body of enemy cavalry was dislodged by a brigade of-the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division from a ridge just east of &quot;the Wadi Imleih. The mounted troops of the Desert Column fell back west of the Wadi Ghuzze for the night, leaving an outpost line from the right of the 54th Division southwards. Consolidation of the Sheikh Abbas -Mansura position continued during the night, and all other preparations for the second stage of the advance, which was ordered to take place on the 19th, were pushed on during the 18th. On this day the Desert Column again made strong reconnaissances towards the east. The Imperial Camel Corps Brigade was detached from the Desert Column and placed under the orders of the General Officer Commanding, 54th Division.The dispositions for the final stage, in which the guns of the French battleship &quot; Requin,&quot; and of H.M. Monitors Nos. 21 and 31 were to co-operate, were as follows : The 54th and 52nd Divisions, acting under the command of General Officer Commanding, 52nd Division, were to attack the Ali Muntar group of works, the 54th pivoting on the right of the 52nd and including in its objective the group of trenches at Khirbet Sihan, east of Gaza, the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade being attached to it for this purpose. The 53rd Division was to attack the enemy trenches in the sand dunes south-west arid west of Gaza, the line Sampson Ridge Sheikh Ajlin being its first objective.The 74th Division, in general reserve, was to advance and take up a position of readiness behind the Sheikh Abbas and Mansura Ridges. Of the Desert Column, the Imperial Mounted Division was to make a dismounted attack on the enemy&apos;s position at El Atawineh, part of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division to seize a spur at Baiket el Sana on the right of the Imperial Mounted Division, and the remainder to be held in reserve to take advantage of any success gained by the Imperial Mounted Division.The containing attack by the cavalry began at dawn, and by 10.30 a.m. the Imperial Mounted Division was on the line Gaza Baiket el Sana Ridge, with its right refused, while the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division had seized the ridge at Baiket el Sana. The Imperial Mounted Division, under shell and machine-gun fire, continued the attack on the Atawineh trenches with the greatest gallantry, but could make little headway. For-the main attack, the bombardment opened at 5.30 a.m. The guns of the &quot; Requin&quot; and the monitors bombarded Ali Muntar and the works immediately to the south-west. These guns kept the enemy&apos;s defences and dug-outs under an accurate and sustained fire and were instrumental during the day in rendering several enemy counter-attacks abortive. At 7.15 a.m. the 53rd Division advanced on Sampson Ridge and Sheikh Ajlin, and at 7.30 a.m. the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, 54th Division and 52nd Division advanced to the attack.&quot; The 53rd Division, though meeting with considerable opposition, gradually worked up to Sampson Ridge, which was carried by the 160th Brigade early in the afternoon. This enabled the 159th Brigade to carry the high ground between this position and the coast with little
opposition, and the first objective of the Division was attained. The remainder of the main attack was not so fortunate. The 155th Brigade, the left brigade of the 52nd Division, made good Lees Hill, the nearest point to our line of the enemys defences on the Ali Muntar Ridge, by 8.15 a.m., but on advancing beyond Lees Hill this brigade came under very heavy machine-gun fire from Outpost Hill, which checked its progress. This prevented any advance of the 156th Brigade, which was echeloned slightly in the right rear of the 155th. A little later one of the Tanks came astride of the lunette on Outpost Hill, causing considerable loss to the enemy, but the infantry could not capture this lunette till shortly after 10 a.m. The Tank was unfortunately hit by three shells and burnt out. Meanwhile, the 54th Division, with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, had advanced steadily under fire on the right of the 52nd Division. Its left brigade, the 162nd, was in advance of the right of the 156th Brigade, and thus exposed to a heavy enfilade fire from the direction of Ali Muntar. At 9.30 a.m. the left of this brigade was heavily counter-attacked, but the enemy were repulsed by machine-gun fire. On the right of the 162nd Brigade, the 163rd Brigade fought its way forward against enemy works between Gaza and Khirbet Sihan. One Tank advanced ahead of the infantry and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy in a redoubt, but was afterwards hit by shell fire and burnt out. The Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, in conjunction with the 4th Australian Light Horse Brigade on its right, entered the enemy trenches at Khifbet Sihan by 9 a,m, the enemy withdrawing to a position some 800 yards to the north. The Imperial Camel Corps Brigade was unable, however, to advance beyond Khirbet Sihan, and the 163rd and 162nd Brigades, in spite of most strenuous and gallant efforts to advance, were repeatedly checked by very heavy fire from this front. Towards noon the left of the 163rd Brigade was forced back by a determined counter-attack from the north-east, and this left the 162nd Brigade in a critical position, but it stood firm until, assisted by the 161st Brigade, the 163rd Brigade was able to regain all the ground it had lost. The enemy-counter-attack against the 163rd Brigade was meanwhile continued against the 4th Australian Light Horse Brigade, which was forced to give ground, and, with the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade on its right, suffered heavy casualties. However, the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, though in a critical position, held on till the 6th Mounted Brigade filled the gap and stopped the enemy&apos;s advance. Heavy shelling and machine-gun fire were directed at the line during the remainder of the afternoon. Meanwhile, the 155th Brigade was shelled out of its position on Outpost Hill, but the position was most gallantly retaken on his own initiative by Major W. T. Forrest, M.C., l/4th Bn. King&apos;s Own Scottish Borderers (subsequently killed), who collected a few men for the purpose. All further attempts by the 155th Brigade to launch an attack from Outpost Hill were shattered by fire at their inception, and the 156th Brigade was forced to remain in the open under a heavy fire.11. The position at 3 p.m. was therefore as follows: The operations of the Desert Column (in effect a &quot; containing attack&quot;) were meeting with all the success which had been anticipated. A serious enemy counter-attack had been checked and driven back.The 54th Division, on the right of the main attack, had progressed, in spite of determined opposition and heavy casualties, as far as was possible until a further advance of the 52nd Division should prevent the exposure of its left flank. Reports received from the 54th Division stated that the situation was satisfactory, and that no help was required in order to enable the ground gained to be held until further progress by the 52nd Division should render practicable a renewal of the advance. I should like to state here my appreciation of the great skill with which General Hare handled his fine division throughout the day.The 52nd Division was unable to advance beyond Outpost Hill. Middlesex Hill, and a large area of extremely broken ground west and north-west of it, had been made by the enemy exceedingly strong. The nests of machine guns in the broken ground could not be located among the narrow dongas, holes and fissures with which this locality was seamed. Partly owing to this, and partly owing to the extent of the area, the artillery fire concentrated upon it was unable to keep down the enemy&apos;s fire when the 155th Brigade attempted to advance. The Reserve Brigade of the 52nd Division had not been employed, and the remaining brigade (the 156th) was in position ready to attack Green Hill and Ali Muntar as soon as the progress of the 155th Brigade on its left should enable it to do so. Up to this time, therefore, only one brigade of the 52nd Division was seriously engaged. The conformation of the ground, however, was such that the attack on Outpost and Middlesex Hills could only be made on an extremely narrow front.    It is possible that if the General Officer Commanding,
Eastern Force, had now decided to throw in his reserves, the key of the position micht have been taken with the further loss of between 5,000 and 6,000 men, but this would have left my small force, already reduced, with a difficult line of front to hold against increasing reinforcements of the enemy, who, owing to the conformation of the terrain, could attack from several directions. As it was, the General Officer Com-manding, Eastern Force, in view of information received that our attack had not yet succeeded in drawing in the enemy&apos;s reserves, decided that the moment had not vet come for an attempt to force a decision by throwing in the general reserve, though he moved the 229th Brigade of the 74th Division up to Mansura, so as to be ready to press home the attack of the 52nd Division whenever required.At 3.30 p.m. an enemy counter-attack against the left of the 162nd Brigade was shattered by our shell fire with heavy loss to the enemy, but otherwise no change occurred in the situation till 6.20 p.m., when the 155th Brigade was forced to evacuate Outpost Hill. Since it was evident that the action could not be brought to a conclusion within the day, at 4 p.m. I issued, personally, instructions to General Officer Com-manding, Eastern Force, that all ground gained during the day must, without fail, be held during the night with a view to resuming the attack on the Ali Muntar position under cover of a concentrated artillery bombardment at dawn on the 20th.The position at nightfall was that the 53rd Division held the Sampson Ridge  Sheikh Ajlin line ; the 52nd Division on its right was facing north towards Outpost Hill and Ali Muntar ; the 54th Division carried the line south-eastwards and south-wards round the Sheikh Abbas Ridge to El Meshrefe, whence the mounted troops continued the line southwards to the Wadi Ghuzze. Our total casualties had amounted to some 7,000.During the night of the 19th 20th I received a message from General Dobell to say that, after careful deliberation and consultation with all divisional commanders, he was strongly of the opinion that the resumption of the attack ordered for the following morning did not offer sufficient prospect of success to justify the very heavy casualties, which such an operation would, in his opinion, involve. He therefore urgently requested my sanction to cancel the instructions previously issued and my approval for the substitution of orders for the consolidation of the positions already gained, to be carried out on the 20th, with a view to a further attack on the enemy&apos;s line at some point between Gaza and Hereira as and when an opportunity might offer. In view of the strongly expressed opinion of the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force, supported by the General Officer Commanding, Desert Column, and the divisional commanders, I assented to this proposal.12. The ground gained by the end of the 19th April was consolidated during the 20th. No ground, in fact, gained on that dav has since been lost, and the position to which we then advanced has facilitated, and will facilitate, further operations. The enemy, contrary to my expectations, made no general counter-attack onthe20th, and all his local counter-attacks were easily repulsed. One counter-attack was nipped in the bud entirely by our aircraft; a reconnaissance machine having detected about 2,000 infantry and 800 cavalry gathered in the Wadi near Hereira; four machines immediately attacked this force, which they found in massed formation, with bombs, and the entire body was dispersed with heavy casualties.On 21st April, General Dobell visited me at my Advanced General Headquarters to discuss the situation. He repeated that in his opinion, which was confirmed by that of all his subordinate commanders, in view of the great strength of the positions to which he was opposed, the renewal of a direct attack with the force at his disposal would not be justified by any reasonable prospect of success. He was most strongly of the opinion that deliberate methods must be adopted, and that even the assumption of trench warfare might be necessary, pending the arrival of reinforcements. After full discussion, and not without considerable reluctance, I assented to this change of policy, and en-the-22nd-April I reported to the War Office that with my present force I-could not probably count on being able to effect-more than a local success.In the meantime, it became apparent to me that General Dobell, who had suffered some weeks previously from a severe touch of the sun, was no longer in a fit state of health to bear the strain of further operations in&apos;the coming heat of summer. To my great regret, therefore, I felt it my duty to relieve him of his command, and to place the command of Eastern Force in the hands of Lieut.-General Sir Philip Ohetwode, Bt., K.CM.G., C.B.. D.S.O. General Chetwode was succeeded in command of the Desert Column by Major-General Sir H. G. Chauvel, K.C.M.G., C.B. ; and Major-General E. W. C. Chaytor, C.B., C.M.G., succeeded to the command of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division.   Accordingly, on the morning of the 21st, I interviewed
General Dobell and informed him of my decision, in which he concurred.   I then interviewed General Chetwode, and instructed him to relieve General Dobell in the command of Eastern Force.

After-4his-time no-notable-change.took-place in the- situation on the Eastern Front, where4he4mmediate--^ held-bythe-minm^^operations.- The enemy continued to receive reinforcements for his units and additional troops, so that early in May I estimated that he had nearly six infantry divisions in his front line, while his total force in this theatre might amount to eight divisions. There was no doubt, moreover, that he had lately received considerable reinforcements in artillery and machine-gun units, as we]l as in mounted troops. Throughout the month he continued to strengthen his positions between Gaza and Hereira, and begun to build a military branch line from El Tine, on the Central Palestine Railway, towards El Me j del, north of Gaza.As the result of recent operations I was closely in touch with the enemy on a front of some 14,000 yards from Sheikh Ajlin, on the sea, to the north-eastern corner of the Sheikh Abbas Ridge. From that point my line turned back through Sharta towards the Wadi Ghuzze, with the right flank extended to Shellal in order to protect my southern flank and to deny to the enemy the valuable supplies lying in the Wadi at that point. In the meantime, arrangements had been made to construct a branch line of railway as rapidly as possible from Rafa to the neighbourhood of Shellal^, to-enable operations-4o-be-conducted-on-a-^railhead at Deir el Belah. By 23rd June this branch line had progressed to/the 25th kilometre, and stations had been made at Amr and Weli Sheikh Nuran. The process of strengthening the northern portion of the position, from the sea to Sharta, in order to set free^as many troops as possible, was energetically continued during the month of May, by &quot;the end of which it was possible, roughly speaking, to hold this portion with two divisions, thus leaving two divisions in general reserve. The mounted troops of the Desert Column were untiring in reconnaissance towards the east and north-east during this time. For the time being, however, the possibility of offensive action was governed by the fact that, exclusive of the -mounted troops, I had only three fully equipped and trained divisions ahdpne partially equipped and trained. The three former divisions required some 350 officers and 9,000 other ranks to bring them up to full strength. During April and May one battalion arrived from East Africa, one from Aden and four from India towards the formation &quot;of a further division, to be called the 75th, but the health of the two former was much impaired, and on the 12th May I was informed that the remaining battalions destined for this division were to be retained in Ind;a for the present. At. the same time I was informed that two mounted brigades would be sent to me from Salonika, together with complete artillery for one division, and also appreciable-feinforcements in heavy artillery. On 27th May I was informed that the remainder of this division, the 60th, would sail for Egypt from Salonika during June. These&apos; prospective additions to the force entailed a considerable amount of reorganization, and at the same time it became necessary to reorganize the transport of the fighting units, in regard to which, in the exigencies of recent operations improviza-tion to meet the needs-of the moment had, of necessity, been resorted to.13. From 6th May the defensive line from Sheikh Ajlin to Tel el Jemmi was reorganized into two sections, to be held on a regular system of reliefs. Cavalry patrolling was actively carried on by the mounted troops, who frequently came into contact with the enemy&apos;s mounted patrols to the east and north-east. During the earlier part of May, the enemy aircraft made several attacks with bombs on Deir ef Belah and other points near the front line. The Royal Flying Corps made effective retaliation against Ramleh and Sheria, and as the month advanced the enemys activity diminished in this respect. During May, also, our heavy batteries, with the co-operation of the Royal Flying Corps, made very effective practice on enemy batteries in the neighbourhood of Gaza. The only event, however, of any note during this month was a cavalry raid carried out on the 23rd and 24th May against the Bir Saba  Auja railway, with the object of preventing the enemy from recovering and using its material for the construction of his branch line from El Tine to Mejdel.The plans for this operation necessitated the movement of one mounted brigade and demolition parties to Bir el Esani, 10 miles W.S.W. of Bir Saba on the Wadi Shanag, during the afternoon before the raid took place.   Since this movement could
not be concealed, it was arranged that an artillery demonstration should take place on the left flank in order to draw the enemy&apos;s attention from the movement on Esani, and place him in doubt as to our intentions. For three days previously the artillery carried out wire-cutting on the Gaza defences, and the enemy&apos;s repairing parties were kept under artillery and machine-gun fire. The artillery demonstration was made more intense during the afternooon of 22nd and the early morning of 23rd May. This demonstration was very successful in making the enemy apprehensive on his right, and he appears to have suffered a considerable number of casualties.On the afternoon of the 22nd, one brigade of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division, with demolition parties from the field squadrons of both mounted divisions, moved to Esani. During the night of the 22nd/23rd this force marched on the railway at Asluj and Hadaj by way of Khalasa. Khalasa was surrounded during the night and no opposition was met with there. The demolition parties reached their positions on the railway line just before 7 a.m. on the 23rd. The Imperial Camel Brigade left. Rafa early on the 22nd and marched approximately down the Turco-Egyptian frontier on Auja. Owing to the difficulties of the country the Imperial Camel Brigade demolition party was unable to begin work on the railway before 11.45 a.m. on the 23rd. The demolition parties had previously been thoroughly trained and their work, once began, was carried out with great rapidity. Those of the mounted divisions completed the destruction of the railway from Asluj to Hadaj about 7 miles by 10 a.m. The destruction of this portion of the line made interference with the work of the Imperial Camel Brigade practically impossible. The demolition party of that brigade, therefore, had time to complete the destruction of six miles of railway eastward from Auja during the day.Thus 13 miles of railway line were completely destroyed, each pair of rails being cut in the centre. One 6-span bridge near Hasaniya, one 12-span bridge over the Wadi el Abiad, a viaduct over the Wadi Theigat el Amiria, and (between Thamiliat el liashid and Asluj) one 18-arched bridge, one 5-arched bridge, one 3-arched bridge, one 2-arched bridge and two culverts? were completely destroyed. All the points and switches at Asluj Railway Station were destroyed. A considerable number of telegraph posts were cut down, wires cut and insulators broken. A quantity of decauville material near Hadaj was destroyed. Finally, a large stone building near Wadi Inkharuba was demolished, with quantities of sandbags, timber and matting.While this work was in progress, the mounted divisions of the Desert Column carried out a demonstration towards Bir Saba and Irgeig. The divisions marched by night on the 22nd/23rd, and during the 23rd carried out a tactical and water recon-naisance of the area immediately west and north-west of Bir Saba. The 10th Heavy Battery, R.G.A., was moved forward behind this force and shelled the viaduct at Irgeig.The withdrawal of the mounted troops was affected without difficulty, the enemy showing no signs of activity. The Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division met a few Arab snipers. One armed Arab was killed and 13 prisoners were taken. The Imperial Mounted Division encountered only slight opposition from small parties of enemy cavalry. Our casualties were one man wounded. During this operation crops which could not be brought in and which would otherwise fall into the hands of the enemy were destroyed by our troops. It is estimated that 120 tons were burnt during the day. One of our aeroplanes employed for inter-communication between Desert Column Headquarters and the Imperial Camel Brigade was damaged in attempting to land near Auja. The Imperial Camel Brigade therefore remained at that place for the night 23rd/24th, and personnel of the brigade succeeded in repairing the aeroplane, the loss of which was thereby avoided, and which returned safely to the aerodrome on the 24th.For the month of June there is nothing of special note to record, the period being mainly one of -energetic preparation for further operations. For the time being, the infantry in the northern part of the line were confined to trench warfare, to which the troops soon adapted themselves, while to the south and south-east our cavalry patrols were daily in touch with the enemy.14. During the period covered by this report, the situation on the Western front has been such as to call for little comment. The light armoured motor batteries, light car patrols and Bikanir Camel Corps, who-form-ihe-gamsons-of-the-p)osts, have been able to keep the whole front free from disturbance. The route from Sollum to Siwa has now been improved, so that Siwa can be reached by car from Sollum in a single day.In consequence-of-an agreement between the Government and Sayed Mohamed
trade with Arabs of the Western parts through the market at Sollum, -the main object being to treat Sayed Idris as liberally as circumstan^s^in&apos;&apos;P&quot;errriit, while at the same time regulating the quantity of food offered foF&quot;sale at Sollum, so as to render it impossible for the Senoussi. to lay in reserve stocks of any appreciable magnitude. The General Officer Commanding, Coastal Section, has been instructed to co-operate wittr the Civil Admin^ I have also issued anew proclamation denning the western line of the Coastal Section, across which no person shall pass without special permit issued by the military authorities at Sollum, movement to and from Egypt, except through Sollum, being forbidden. With a view to preventing any disturbing effect on the local population, and also to prevent any feeling of mistrust which might arise in the mind of Sayed Idris by any action of our armed parties, I have given instructions that the latter should not operate beyond our western frontier, which, for purposes of convenience, was defined broadly as a line running north and south from Sollum to the western end of Melfa Oasis.The attitude of the Sheikhs and inhabitants at Siwa is very friendly, and the former are co-operating loyally in carrying out all instructions received from the civil and military authorities regarding restrictions of trade, repair of road passes and the destruction of the Senoussi &quot;Zawias&quot; or teaching housesNo incident has occurred in the Southern Canal Section, the garrison of which has been considerably reduced since-the beginning of the year. The extent of the Northern Canal Section increased continuously as&apos; the Eastern Force advanced, and at the beginning of May this command was reorganized as that of the General Officer Commanding, Palestine Lines of Communication Defences, wi fla- headquarters at El Arish. This command now extends from the northern part of the Suez Canal to Khan Yunus, and includes the responsibility for the defence of almost the whole length of the military railway and pipe-lines. Except for attacks by hostile aircraft, no enemy attempts have been made against the lines ot communication, but between 7th and 11th May a small force from this command, consisting of two companies Imperial Camel Corps and a field troop, made a successful expedition to El Auja, Birein and Kossaima, for the purpose of blowing up the wells and water supply at those places to the utmost possible extent. The force met with no opposition, captured five prisoners and completed successfully the demolitions, including that of the railway bridge north-east of El Auja.I^-Arpril-^Sofe^ Officer,wlhle-forming-part-of-a^oint^^nglo-Freneh---Ptv]itical--M-ission&quot;m---w-hich&apos;&apos;Mi---Picot-was- the chief French-representative.---^ begiuning-of-May-and subsequently paid a visit to the Hedjaz:I have great pleasure in recording the addition to the force under my command of a French detachment under M. le Colonel Piepape and of an Italian detachment under Major da Agostino.

An inspector, Palestine Lines of Communication, was therefore appointed. His headquarters were established at Kantara on 2nd May and the advantage of this appointment has been proved by the increased efficiency of the lines of communication services east of the canal.15. In conclusion, I should like to place on record my appreciation of the magnificent work done by all the fighting troops before Gaza. No praise can be too high for the gallantry and steadfastness of the cavalry, infantry, artillery, Royal Flying Corps and all other units which took part in the two battles. Particular commendation is due to the infantry. The 52nd, 53rd and 54th Divisions, though actively engaged for over a year in the Sinai Peninsula, had not, since their reorganization after the operations in the Dardanelles, been able to show how they had improved out of all knowledge in training and discipline and in all that goes to make up an excellent fighting organization. Under severe trial they have now given ample proof of the finest soldierly qualities. It is hardly necessary to reiterate the praises of the Australian and New Zeahmd mounted troops, who have always come up to their high reputation, and their comrades in the mounted yeomanry have shown themselves to be endowed with the same bravery, vigour and tenacity. The Imperial Camel Corps, manned by Australian, New Zealand and British personnel, has proved a corps d elite, possessed with a quite remarkable spirit of
gallantry. The distinguished service rendered by the troops from India is deserving of high commendation. Units of the Indian Regular Army, mounted and dismounted Imperial Service troops and the Bikanir Camel Corps have shown soldierly qualities in action, discipline and endurance; and I wish to record the unfailing devotion to duty of the battalions in garrison in Egypt and to the British West Indies Regiment. The Camel Transport Corps and the Egyptian Labour Corps two units raised in this country are worthy of the warmest praise for their untiring labours, under the severest conditions, in close conjunction with the fighting troops.The health of the troops has throughout been singularly good. All branches of the medical services, under Surgeon-General J. Maher,&apos; C.B., deserve the highest commendation for their successful work at the front, on the lines of communication and in the base hospitals. The presence in the force of a number of civil medical consultants, who have so patriotically given their services, has been of the very greatest value, and they have worked in successful accord with the regular medical services of the Army. The Australian Army Medical Corps and the New Zealand Medical Corps have also been remarkable for their efficiency and unremitting devotion.The workings of the supply and transport services have had to take into account quite abnormal conditions, both of supplies available and terrain, involving in some cases complete reorganization of units to suit local conditions. In spite of this, the functions of these services have been discharged in a most admirable manner, and great credit is due to the Director, Brigadier-General G. F. Davies, C.M.G., and to all ranks under him.The same local conditions above referred to have rendered the force more than usually dependent on animal transport, while operations have involved the use of important mounted forces. The remount and veterinary services have consequently held a vital place in the organization, and they have carried out their respective tasks to my complete satisfaction.I have, in a previous despatch, brought to notice the admirable work pf the Signal services, and I need only now add that this service has continued in its efficient and highly satisfactory condition. The work done by the engineer services and the works directorate deserves high commendation.There is, perhaps, no department which has a greater influence upon the morale of an Army than that of the Chaplains&apos; Department. The thorough and self-sacrificing manner in which chaplains of all denominations, under the principal chaplain, Brigadier-General A. V. C. Hordern, C.M.G., have carried out their duties, has earned the gratitude of all ranks.The impossibility of granting leave home on any extended scale has rendered the Army in tl*e Field dependent on rest camps and voluntary institutions for that rest and relaxation so necessary in view of the arduous conditions of campaigning in the desert and in tropical heat. I wish to take this, my last, opportunity of expressing the thanks of the whole Field Force to those ladies and gentlemen who have done so much to obviate the deprivations imposed on it by those conditions. Especially are they due to the Church Army and the Young Men&apos;s Christian Association, whose recreation huts are provided, not only in the rest camps, but also throughout the front. It would be hard to exaggerate the value of these institutions, both in sustaining the morale and the health of the troops.The dealing with reinforcements and material arriving from England, the transference of such large numbers of troops to other theatres of war, the keeping of records thus affected and the registration of casualties and evacuation of sick and wounded, have thrown very heavy work on the base ports. The staffs responsible for these matters have discharged their arduous duties with marked efficiency, frequently under difficult climatic conditions and abnormal pressure.In spite of the important operations in progress during this time, military training has been continued with undiminished vigour. The Imperial School of Instruction at Zeitoun has by now passed over 22,000 officers and non-commissioned officers through its hands.A staff school was started early in the year for the training of junior staff officers. Three ; courses, each of about six weeks, were held at this school for which accom-modation was found just outside Cairo, the number of candidates at the first two courses being shared between this force and the Salonika Force, while the last course was confined to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. The results of these courses have been exceedingly useful, and the instruction has been extremely well carried out.His Highness The Sultan has, throughout the period of my command, given me valuable encouragement and wise counsel, based on his unrivalled knowledge of Eastern affairs.
I wish once more to thank His Excellency The High Commissioner, General Sir F. R Wingate, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., K.C.M.G., D.S.O., for the ready assistance and quick sympathy which he has given me in all my work; all branches of the Civil Government of Egypt have assisted the Forces in the Field with unfailing readiness.My gratitude is also due to Vice-Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, K.C.B., C.M.G., M.V.O., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies and Egypt, for his part in securing the unfailing co-operation of the Royal Navy at all times ; and I wish to make special reference to the admirable and gallant work done by the Naval Air Service, which has been of the greatest assistance to my operations.My Chief of the General Staff, Major-General Sir Arthur Lynden Lynden-Bell, K.C.M.G., C.B., has-given me unvarying and loyal support at all times. He has proved himself an ideal Chief of the General Staff, combining a thorough knowledge of his duties with an activity and an energy that overcomes all difficulties. He has earned the confidence of all ranks.Major-General John Adye, C.B., has been an excellent Deputy Adjutant-General, having great knowledge of all administrative work and sound judgment. He has been of the greatest assistance to me.Major-General Sir Walter Campbell, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O., my Deputy-Quarter-master-General, is an organizer of great general ability, very sound and hardworking. I owe a great debt of gratitude to this officer.The General Officer Commanding, Eastern Force, Lieut.-General Sir P. W. Chetwode, Bt., K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O., has united the qualities of brilliant leadership and sure judgment, and has invariably inspired confidence in all ranks.The labours of a Commander-in-Chief in the Field are considerably lightened when the complex and difficult duties which fall to the military secretary are ably discharged. In this respect I have been fortunate. Lieut.-CoIonel S. H. Pollen, C.M.G., is an officer of outstanding ability and sound judgement, and the manner in which he has carried out his duties has greatly contributed to the smooth working of the staff, and is beyond praise.I am submitting, in a further despatch, the names of officers, non-commissioned officers and men and others whom I wish to bring to notice for gallant and distinguished service during the period under review.I have the honour to be,Your Lordship&apos;s most obedient Servant,A. J. MURRAY, General,Commanding-in- Chief, Egyptian Expeditionary Force.



rAPPENDIX I.WATER STJPPLT EAST OP THE SUEZ CANAL. From January, 1916, to Juke, 1917.When it was decided that the construction of a defensive line east of the Suez Canal should be ta&apos;ten up seriously, tbe important question of how the troops could be provided with an adequate supply of pure water was at once considered.No known source of fresh water existed for many miles eastward of the Canal line. Opto November, 1915, the small garrisons and posts stationed on the east bank had been supplied with water by means of water-barges from Port Said, Ismailia and Tewfik ; but it was obviously impossible to employ these means on so large a scale as the new system of defences indicated.If, by sinking deep tube-wells on the spot, drinkable water in sufficient quantity were obtainable, this was obviously the simplest and most economical plan. It was decided, therefore, after consultation with the Egyptian Geological Department, to make experimental borings at various selected points east of the Canal. Nothing, however, but salt water was obtained, although the wells were sunk to a depth of 300 feet. Later, similar borings were made in the Romani-Mahamdiya region with a like result.The only other possible source of supply was the Sweet Water Canal, which runs, roughly, parallel with, arid contiguous to, the Ship Canal on its western side throughout, practically its entire length. But before this supply could be utilized for the camps and defence works, which were to be established eastward it would be necessary to filter the water as well as to get it across the Suez Canal.Ten concentration points were selected at intervals throughout the length of the Suez Canal; and at six of these points, viz.:-Kantara, Ballah, Ferdan, Serapeum, Shallufa and Kubri, filtering plant has been installed. The filters are close to the Sweet Water Canal, except at Perdan and Ballah, where special water conduit^, four miles long, have had to be excavated.Of the other four selected points, Ferry Post b;is received its water, already filtered from Ismailia town supply; El Shatt has been connected up on the eastward side with the Kubri system, while both Kabrit and Quarantine are supplied by water barges, the latter having a salt-water condensing plant as a stand-by.From the filters at the six points first mentioned the purified water is carried by syphon-pipes across the bed of the Suez Canal into re-inforced concrete reservoirs on the east bank.Near these reservoirs machinery has been installed, and the water pumped forward to the camps and defences through a system of pipe lines. This pumping-machinery had to be ordered to meet requirements, which it was impossible to adequately forecast, and the plant was therefore not always equal to the task allotted to it.When preparing the original scheme of water-supply it was estimated that it would be necessary to pump water to an elevation of about 200 feet. In some cases, however, posts have been established at considerably greater heights, even up to 450 feet above sea level. To meet this difficulty, intermediate reservoirs and relay pumping stations have been provided on the pipe-lines.Instructions to prepare for an advance in force from Pomani to El Arish were issued in July. It was decided to lay down a pipe line of 12 inches diameter to supply water for the troops and railway, and orders for the necessary material were at once placed in England.Steps were taken to provide at Kantara an additional filter plant capable of dealing with 500,000 gallons a day, three more 6-inch syphons under the canal, two 250,000 gallons reservoirs, two sets of pumping engiues, each of 66 h.p. in separate engine houses to drive the water to Romani, and a special wharf to discharge machinery and pipes from ocean steamers.The first shipload of pipes for [this new main reached Kantaia on the 20th September, and filtered water was flowing through the new main into reservoirs at Romani 25 miles away on the 17th November.At Romani, at Bir-el-Abd, and at Mazar, in succession, storage reservoirs, and pumping stations similar to those at Kantara have been provided. At the last two places construction con menced as soon as the advancing troops had secured the situation. Filtered water reached Bir-el-Abd, 47 miles from Kantara, on tiie 1st December, 1916, and it reached Mazar, 70 miles from Kantara. on the 10t.li January, 1917.The pipes necessary to complete the last section of the line into El Arish reached Kantara on the 30th December, 1916, and the pipe line into El Arish was completed by 5th Eebruary, 1917.With the completion of the pipe line into El Arish, the available stock of piping of over 6 inches diameter, and also of heavy engines and pipes, had been wholly absorbed. When, therefore, it was decided in the middle of February, to extend the piped water system east of El Arish, through Sheikh Zowaiid to Rafa, it became necessary to supply the additional piping required for this extension by the collection of all available 6-inch, 5-inch, and 4-inch pipes from lines in re:ir, the maintenance of which was no longer essential.This line has now been still further extended to the Wadi Ghuzze in the neighbourhood of Abu Bakra, to which point it is possible to supply by pump from Rafa up to 60,000 gallons a day.As regards the development oflocal*water resources in the immediate area of our present operations, there are at Khan Yuuus three stone-lined wells, producing an average daily supply of from 100,000 to 120,000 gallons of good water. Pumping plant has been installed, and the greater part of this water (approximately 80,000 gallons per diem) is now distributed by pipe line to the troops in the neighbourhood of Abasan-el-Kebir and Abu Sitta.At Deir-el-Belah wells exist, but the water is brackish, and is not at present fit for consumption by white troops, who have thi-refore to be supplied with drinking water by rail from El Arish, the local supply being utilized exclusively for watering animals. There are, however, indications that a supply of drinking water might be developed at a lower level in this neighbourhood by deep boring, work upon which is at present in progress in the Mendur Jemmi area.On the main line at present occupied by our troops on in front of the Wadi Ghuzze arrangements for supply and distribution of water are, briefly, as follows: Near the mouth of the Wadi water has been developed in shallow wells in the sand dunes in sufficient quantity to supply approximately two divisions.
In the Sheikh Abbas section it has not yet been found possible to develop any local supply, and the troops are supplied with water rail-borne from El Arish, pumped forward through a pipe line from temporary reservoirs at railhead (Deir-el-Belah).Arrangements are now well in hand to supply troops in the Mendur area with water pumped from Kantara along the pipe line, vid Rafa, Abu Katli, Abu Sitta and Abu Bakra. The Khan Yunus supply can also be.pumped into this pipe line.At Shellal springs which now produce a supply of about 200,000 gallons a day have been developed, a reservoir has been constructed to store water, and preparations are being made to instal a pumping station to pump water forward in the direction of Abu Hareira.At El Gamli and at Bir-el-Esani there are springs believed to be capable of extensive development, but these have not yet been fully reported on.During the advance of the troops through the desert it was not always possible to provide a piped supply of water. It has been carried forward many miles in fantasses by camels and in water tanks by the railway line.Sidings have been specially laid where trains of water tanks on railway trucks were filled from batteries of stand pipes. At the railhead, at block-houses and intermediate posts permanent reservoirs have been built or temporary canvas tanks installed.The JR. E. Field Companies and Field Squadrons on the Eastern front have, provisionally, been specially organized and provided with equipment to enable them to develop local resources to the fullest possible exteut. Each field company equipped for desert warfare carries 12 complete sets of pumps, water-troughs, tube wells and linings for shallow wells.At Mnhamdiya, on the Mediterranean Coast, and at Quarantine Station in the Gulf of Suez, condensing machinery has been erected and is available for use in the event of failure nf supplies by water-boat or other sources.With regard to the system of filtration adopted : After careful consideration of the subject and consultation with engineering authorities in Egypt, it was decided that the method of mechanical purification by filters, as used in Cairo, Alexandria and other large Egyptian towns; should be employed ; and the results have been most satisfactory.At Moascar Camp a slow sand filter was installed and has proved very successful.APPENDIX II.RAILWAYS.Fkom Januaky, 1016, to June, 1917. A. Suez Canal Defences.As it had been decided to increase the force in Egypt and to adopt a line of defence in front of the Suez Canal, a considerable amount of railway had to be laid. The general idea was to have nine depots on the east bank of the Suez Canal aud to have a 2 foot 6-inch gauge railway and a road from each depot.to the second line of trenches, and a 60 centimetre gauge Decauville line and a road from ea^h depot to the front line of trenches.From a railway traffic point of view it might have been better to have had two long loop lines, one south and one north of the Bitter Lakes, and one spur line from Port Said east to Mahamdiya, but tactical considerations outweighed the question of -convenience in railway working and short spur lines were laid. The depots on the east bank of che Suez Canal were to be connected with the State Railway line by swing bridges over the Suez Canal, and branch lines from the Suez Canal west bank to the State Railways&apos; main line whenever the distance rendered such branches advisable; the State Railway line between Port. Said and Suez runs more or less parallel to the Suez Canal and west of itOrders were received by the State Railways to prepare a general scheme on these lines on the 25th November, 1915.It was evident that in order to deal with the proposed numbers of troops the line from Zagazig to Ismailia would have to be doubled. On the 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th November, 1915, the general manager went over the ground with the General Officer in charge of the defence and arranged to carry out his orders. Work began on the 1st December, 1915, and it was to be finished by 15th January, 1916.The following work had to be done : 1. Zagazig Ismailia doubling. Line from Zagazig to Ismailia had to be doubled.2. Sidings from, State Railways to Suez Canal. Sidings had to be laid from the Port Said Suez branch of the State Railways to the Suez Canal west bank at Ferdan, Ismailia (Ferry Post), Serapeum, Shallufa and Kubri.3. Stations for camps on State Railways. Special stations and sidings for camps were required at Ballah, Ain Ghosein, Abu Sultan, Abu Halab, Kantara, Ismailia and Suez. Large stations had already been made at Moascar and Tel-el-Kebir.4. Extra crossing stations on State Railways. Besides the special stations and sidings for camps, extra stations for crossing trains were wanted at El Hersh, Fanara and El Gebel.In carrying out items 1, 2, 3 and 4, 150 kilometres of new standard gauge track belonging to the Egyptian State Railways were used, this being the quantity bought for doing renewals for the two years 1916-1917.   All renewals have accordingly been postponed as far as the State Railways are concerned.5. Light railways east oj the Suez Canal. These lines were 2.6-inch gauge except the one at Kantara which was metre gauge.
6. Standard gauge east of Suez Canal- A standard 4-8^-iach gauge line from Kantara was decided on in February&apos; 1916, the original destination being a point in the neighbourhood of Katia.7 Metre gauge and Decauville lines.-The metre gauge line east of Kantara, which went as far as Romani and had a branch to Deuidar, and the Decauville lines were all laid by the Engineer-in-Ohief.The metre gauge line has been closed and as the material is only hired it will be pulled up and returned to the owners.B.  Western Frontier Defences.1. Alexandria-Dabaa Line-In addition to the works for the defence of the Suez Canal, it was decided to enlarge the stations on this line in order to deal with the troops of the Western Frontier Force.2. JBaharia Line. It was decided to lay a 2 feet 6 inches guage railway from Sandafa westwards for 134 kilometres m the direction of the Baharia Oasis.3. Ei tension west of Kharga Oasis.-The 2 feet 6 inches gauge line from the Nile Yalley to Kharga Oasis was extended to a point 30 kilometres west ot Kharga Oasis.Item No. 1.Ismailia-Zagazig doubling.-The doubling of this section of line began on the 6th December, 1915&apos; and was completed on 6th January, 1916. It is 79 kilometres long; 15,000 men were employed on the work. The new line was laid with Egyptian Railways&apos; standard track, which has 47 kilometre rails. Some ridges had to be widened and, of course, stations and signalling had to be altered to suit double line working.Item No. 2.Sidings from State Railway between Port Said and Suez to west bank of Suez Canal. These were laid at the following places: (a.) Ferdan. Siding about 1^ kilometres, with sidings for supply depot, &amp;c, at the end.(b) Ismailia. Siding about 2^ kilometres long from main line to West Bank of Suez Canal at aplace called Ferry Post.&quot; At Ferry Post there are railway workshops for all the 2 feet 6 incLesgauge lines east of the Canal and Supply, Ordnance and Royal Engineer Depots, (c.) Serapevm. Siding about 3 kilometres long with opening bridge over the Sweet Water Canal andsidings for Supplies, Ordnance and Royal Engineer Stores on the Suez Canal bank. (d.) Shallufa. Siding 3 kilometres long with opening bridge over Sweet Water Canal and sidings forSupplies, Ordnance and Royal Engineer Stores on the Suez Canal bank. (e.) Kubri. Siding 3^ kilometres long with opening bridge over the Sweet Water Canal and sidings forSupplies, Ordnance and Royal Engineer Stores on the Suez Canal bank.Item No. S.The existing stations at the following places had to be provided with extra siding accommodation, platforms, &amp;c. : -(a.) El Hersh. New loop and platform.(b.) Kantara. Very large alterations, partly owing to the necessity of providing for the traffic goingfrom the west to the east of the Canal, partly owing to the new line from Salieh, which was i constructed in 1916.   For many trains Kantara became a terminal station, so a triangle had tobe provided for turning engines and extra sidings for remarshalling trains were wanted.Platform accommodation had to be largely increased and sidings and hospital trains aaddisinfecting plants had to be laid, (c.) Ballali. Loop and sidings with new platform to facilitate work on troop trains. (d.) Ferdan. -Extra siding in old station to work with siding to Canal bank mentioned in Item 2 (a)above.(e.) Ismailia. New sidings in old station and three new sidings for a new goods station for armytraffic, two new sidings for emergency trains to stand on. (/.) Ain Ghosein. New station for cavalry camp.   Two loops siding for water train, and platform. (g.) Serapeum. New station on maiu line for camp and for working siding mentioned above, Item 2,paragraph (c).(h.) Abu Sultan. New station for camp.   Two loops, water, train siding and platform. (i.) Abu Halab. New station for camp.   Two loops, water, train siding and platform. (j.) Shallufa. New station on main line for camp and for working siding mentioned in Item 2 (d), above.(h.) Kubri. New station on main line (two loops and water siding) for camp and to work with sidingreferred to above, Item 2 (e). (L) (i.) Suez.   Camp Station. A new station at the north end of Suez, with siding 2 kilometres longand two loops at the end of. it, for dealing with supplies, &amp;c. (ii.) Suez Docks. The railway accommodation was insufficient here, and some new sidings were laid in;but there was very little room for sidings, and until more land has been reclaimed the quay lineswill always be very cramped. (in.) Loops for crossing trains were put in at Fanara and El Gebel.   These were for convenience inworking the traffic.Item No. 5.Details of 2 feet 6 inches gauge lines. The material used was mainly 25 lb. rails and steel sleepers provided by the War Office. The engines were petrol driven and gave a great deal of trouble at first The wagons were good as regards underframes, bat the truck platforms are too narrow, and chilled cast wheels are not the best type for work in the desert. The- lines were, of coursa, not designed for the use to which they were put. Some of the lines were laid with heavier rails and wood sleepers from the Egyptian State Railways. At first six branches were decided on, but later one was added from Port Said east to Mahamdiya, and the line from Shatt to Quarantine was extended to Ayun Musa.
The lines as eventually laid are as follows : Length in kilometres.Port Said, east, to Mahamdiya.......... 41Ballah, eastwards   ..      ..      ..       ..                * *       * * 8*8Ferdan, eastwards ..      ..      ..      ..      ..               * * 9*8Ismailia (Ferry Post), eastwards..........

The traffic varied&apos;considerably from time to time, a large part thereof consisting of stone for road-making.The greatest tonnage on any one line in a week amounted in the case of the Shallufa line in Majr, 1916, to 2,900 tons, of which 2,100 tons were stone.The weekly average tonnage carried on all the 2 feet 6 inches gauge lines in January, 1917, was 6,500tons.The maximum train load varied on the different lines, according to their ruling gradient, between eight and 18 five-ton trucks or the equivalent thereof.These lines have all been closed, but have been left in such a condition that they can be reopened if necet-sary.Item No. 6.Standard gauge lines east of the Suez Canal. The standard (4 feetS^- inches) gauge line from Kantara east-wards was commenced towards the end of February, 1916, the original destination being the neighbourhood of Katia, the materials used being- 75-lb. Vignolles section steel rails on wooden sleepers with bearing plates and spikes.Siding accommodation for locomotives and trucks was laid down at Kantara proportional to this length of line.   It has had to be larsrely increased subsequently owing to the extension of the line to El Arish.The line reached Romani (kilometre 40-5) on the 15th May, 1916, when a branch line to Mahamdiya (5^ kilometres) was taken in hand and completed on the 20th June. 1916.The extension of the line beyond Romani began again on the 7th July, 1916, but was stopped at kilometre 47 on the 18th July and was not resumed till the 10th August. During the intervals, much work was done in providing additional siding accommodation at Kantara and elsewhere.The line reached El Abd (kilometre 76) on the 5th October, 11)16, from which point arrangements were made for an increased rate of progress.Bir el Mazar (kilometre 113*5) was reached on the 17th November, 1916, and railhead on the 16th February, 1917, was at kilometre 170 or 15 kilometres east of El Arish.During this period the depot at Kantara was further enlarged and to some extent re-arranged to cope with increased traffic and the greater length of line served.From the 16th February, 1917 (kilometre 170) to the 28th March, 1917, when kilometre 215 was reached, construction continued regularly, stations being laid in at El Burj, Sheikh Zoweiid, Rafa and Khan Yunus  besides some smaller crossing stations necessary for traffic working.At kilometre 215 there was a slight check due to military operations, but work was soon resumed and railhead reached Deir-el-Belah on the 4th April, 1917. Here a siding had to be laid down to the beach, four kilometres away ; also a long siding (about three kilometres) for watering a post; besides the usual station with siding for supplies, hospital, &amp;c.The mileage of track laid in this railway is greater than might be supposed, because every alternate station has to be large enough to deal with the traffic necessary for feeding, munitioning and, to a certain extent, watering the force.On the 23rd April, 1917, orders were given for the construction of abranch line from Rafa to Wadi Sheikh Nuran and from there southwards to Gamli. Sbeikh Nuran Station was reached on the 18th May, 1917, Gamli (kilometre 26 from Rafa) on the 13th June, 1917.A branch line to Shellal was started from kilometre 22f on the Rafa Gamli branch.The large Wadi at Shellal was reached on the 15th June, 1917, and bank parties are now doing the heavy earthwork necessary to get the line down into the bed of the Wadi, across it and up the other side. There is a very large cube of earthwork here, and a bridge is wanted over the Wadi itself. The whole work is estimated to require 40 days from 3rd June if no very hard soil or rock is met with.Meanwhile, the track-laying parties are occupied in laying in loops for the extra crossing stations and diversions referred to above.On the 9th March, at a conference with the Commander-in-Chief, it was settled to keep the line beyond Gaza near the coast and not to try for an inland route.On the 10th March, 1917, a bad sand storm began which lasted for six days-and interfered with traffic very much. It was impossible to see far and the line became covered with sand in many places. An attempt to push traffic in spite of the storm led to six derailments in one day. It took some time to catch up the arrears of traffic.   Fortunately, since then there have only been two bad days.A steel girder bridge on cylinders is being built across Wadi-el-Arish and should be finished before the next rainy season; another minor bridge is being built. So far there have not been many water courses to cross, but as the line goes north the climate changes, more rain falls, and a number of culverts will be required besides a few^ larger bridges. Provision has been made for these, and the girders for the next section of the line are in the country. Rails, fish-plates and a large proportion of the sleepers have been supplied from India. The finish of the rails is equal to the best English work. It remains to be seen how they will wear.For various reasons (mainly water and the necessity of laying large stations at frequent intervals) the capacity of the line was put at 13 trains a day on an average.   This, of course, means that more than that
number have to be run occasionally. The coastwise water transport has helped very much and so far the 13 trains have seldom been needed.A few more crossing stations are being put in and some other alterations made which will bring the capacity of the single line up to 16 trains each way daily on an average. If more than these are needed the water supply must somehow be increased, and I think it would be wise to double the line as far as Rafa at all events, and several other points will need attention.More rolling stock and engines have been seut from the Egyptian State Railways; 14 more South-Western locomotives and 6 more coaches have been received from England.The total engines and vehicles now on the Kantara East Line are as follows : 			Supplied by War	Supplied by Egyptian	Total.

Water supply has been one of the chief difficulties to contend with, water having to be carried by rail beyoud the furthest point of supply by pipe-line, to some considerable extent.Communication with West Bank of Suez Canal. A fe:ry has been constructed at Kantara which is capable of carrying an engine (or four wagons), so that any engine or wagon which requires heavy repairs can be ferried over the Suez Canal and run up to the State Railway shops in Cairo.B. Western Frontier Defences.Item No. 1.  Western Frontier Force.Alexandria Dabaa Line. The stations on this line had to have all the crossing loops lengthened to take larger trains than the line was designed for. Full-sized trains cannot be used on this line as the bridge over the channel from Lake Mariout will not cany the heaviest engines.Water. The great difficulty on this line is water. There is none fit for troops or boilers, and all water has to be carried in tank trucks.Rolling Stock. Provided from Egyptian State Railway stock.The 4 feet 8^ inches gauge line from Alexandria to Dabaa is now working on a peace basis again. 166 kilometres of good rails could be obtained from this line if necessary for use elsewhere, but a large number of the sleepers would need replacing and a considerable percentage of new fastenings would be required.Item No. 2.  Western Frontier Force.JSaharia Military Railway. The line from Sandafa towards the Oasis of Baharia is 134 kilometres long. Gauge. 2-feet 6-inches gauge.Materials. Steel rails, wooden sleepers, spikes, no bearing plates.   Material all second-hand, bought from various light railway companies in Egypt or provided by the State Railways. Gradient. The ruling- gradient is 1 in 100Tiaffic. Traffic for this line goes by the State Railways main Upper Egypt line to Maghagha, then over the Upper Egypt Auxiliary Railways to Saudafa, where it is transhipped to the 2 feet 6 inch wagons of the Baharia military line. The Upper Egypt Auxiliary Railways are light 4 feet 8  inch gauge lines, the property of the Egyptian State Railways.Bridges. A large bridge had to be built over the Bahr Tussef Canal at Sandafa.R Ming Stock. There are 20 engines and 200 wagons.   A train consists of 1 brake van and 13 five-ton wagons useful load, 65 tons.Sa?id. Sand gives trouble ou this line, it drifts over it very rapidly if there is a strong wind. This line is still working but with a greatly reduced traffic.
Item No. 3.  Western Frontier Force. Extension west of Kharga Oaszs.-There was a line from the Nile Valley to Kharga Oasis before the war   ength, 195 kilometres Gauge. 2 feet 6 inches.Gradient. 1 in 30 on worst-section, which is that leading down to the Oasis itself. Materials. 41^ lb. rails.   Steel sleepers mainly, but some wooden.Boiling stock. Four engines, 24 ten-ton wagons.   The engines are powerful for this class of line. Composition of train. An engine can pull 10 ten-ton wagons up the steepest gradient. It was decided to extend this line to a point 30 kilometres west of Kharga in order to reach a part of the country which was comparatively free from drift sand and more suitable for motor cars. The line is still working, but with a greatly reduced traffic.Work on Egyptian State Railways.Traffic. The work on these lines has been much increased by the army. There are troop and hospital trains to be dealt with and supplies, stores and ammunition as well. A table is attached which will show the traffic dealt with during 1916.The State railways are feeling the loss of rolling stock and engines sent east of the Canal, but not seriously so far. When the force is increased more wagons will be needed on the State lines for collecting and distributing food, &amp;c, for the army, and with this and the necessity for sending more wagons east of the Canal shortly there will certainly not be enough rolling stock to meet the usual demands made made by the public during the cotton season. Cotton and seed will have to be moved more slowly. This will probably lead to complaints, but is unavoidable.Workshops. Besides the extra repairs to rolling stock necessitated by the extra traffic, a great deal of special work has been done in the workshops, such as construction of and repairs to wagons of all sorts, making camel saddles, parts of guns and machine guns, bombs, &amp;c. Extra men have been taken on to deal with this work or to take the place of meu who are employed on it.EGYPTIAN STATE RAILWAYS.Summary op Military Transports during 1916.Special Troop Trains Run (including Camel Trams, Specials for Labourers, &amp;c.).Number of trains.

r24APPENDIX III.EGYPTIAN   LABOUR   CORPS.January, 1916, to June, 1917.Organization, Recruiting and Development.With the exception of the Naval wing, which is still at Mudros, the Egyptian Labour Coips, after proving a useful unit during the Gallipoli campaign, returned to Egypt in January, 1916.Headquarters were at Alexandria and only 500 men were working at Mersa Matruh.The Engineer-in-Chief asked for 500 men for work on the Canal, and on the 7th January these arrived and were distributed equally between Port Said, Ballah, Ismailia, Serapeum and Suez Docks. Shortly after this camps were opened at Shallufa, Kubri, Ayun Musa, Ferry Post and Kantara, bringing the strength up to 1,000,men, all for Royal Engineer services,During February and March demands for labour were continuously received from A.S.C. and Ordnance, and the numbers employed by the Engineer-in-Chief were increased. Sanitary gangs were asked for by medical services to undertake the sanitary fatigues by all camps. By the end of April the strength of the corps was 42 officers and 9,000 men.In order to meet the persistent demands for men the formation of a recruiting department under the Egyptian Labour Corps was necessary, the establishment being 1 officer, 1 doctor and 1 native clerk for each 10,000 men of the corps.During May 5,000 additional men were indented for by the Engineer-in-Chief and obtained with ease ; 150 of them were despatched to Alamein for road making, and it is interesting to note that the road con-structed was first made by the Romans, repaired by Napoleon, and remade by the Egyptian Labour Corps.Also during May and June four new canips were established in Upper Egypt at Kharga, Samalut, Shusha and Fayum. These camps were at first administered separately from Alexandria, but later on an Officer Commanding, Upper Egypt, with headquarters at Minia became necessary.During June and July the strength at Kantara and in the Katia area increased considerably to meet military requirements, and it was found necessary for purposes of administration to divide the Canal into three sections.During June it had been found possible to reduce the pay of unskilled labour to T.P. 5 per day without impairing the efficiency of the corps.In July a depot was formed at Hadra Camp for recruiting and training volunteers for Egyptian Labour Corps and other units required. The training of 1,000 drivers for horse transport units was at once put in hand.   They were drafted into divisional trains thus replacing an equivalent number of Biitish troops.On 2nd August instructions were received to recruit all the men required by the Camel Transport Corps and to attest them for continuous service at a pay of T.P. 7 per day. This pay was afterwards reduced to T.P. 6, and 19,000 camel drivers were recruited up to 30th November, and all demands for drivers met in the promptest manner.Owing to the fact that Egyptian Labour Corps labourers serve on a 3 months&apos; contract, it is necessary to recruit one-third of the total strength of the Corps each month.As all men under orders for overseas must be trained a second large depot was formed on Roda Island, Cairo, for recruiting and training volunteers.Recruiting. As the demand for Egyptian Labour Corps men increased it became necessary to open recruiting camps.The first camp for recruiting was opened at Assiut Upper Egypt, on the 16th October, 1916, which was followed by a second camp, with the same object, at Sohag, 90 miles south of Assiut.Both these camps have proved of great value, and men can now be collected in the camps and despatched to the coast by special trains in drafts of 2,000.On 12th February, 1917, a separate recruiting service was formed for recruiting men in Upper Egypt for the Camel Transport Corps and Middle and Lower Egypt.were developed as a recruiting area for the Egyptian Labour Corps.On 8th May, 1917, recruiting for all services wasj taken over by a recruiting department, which is now being developed.The following recruiting figures are of interest: Recruited by the Egyptian Labour Corps for Egyptian Labour Corps from1st Jauuary, 1916, to 12th February, 1917 ..........      127,862Recruited by the Egyptian Labour  Corps for Camel Transport Corps during the same period..      ..      ............       28,305156,167Recruited by the Egyptian Labour Corps from 13th February, 1917, to8th May, 1917, in Lower Egypt for Egyptian Labour Corps       ..       .. 27,599Recruited by special recruiting service from 13th February, 1917, to 8th May,1917, for Egyptian Labour Corps     ..      ..       ..      ..      ..      .. 7,235Recruited by new recruiting department from 9th May, 1917, to 23rd June,1917, for Egyptian Labour Corps     ............ 23,086214,087Egyptian Labour Corps men working in Egypt and Palestine are engaged on a 3 months&apos; contract. Egyptian Labour Corps men for overseas are engaged on a 6 months&apos; contract dating from the day of embarkation.In September, 1916, contractors&apos; men were replaced by Egyptian Labour Corps on the east bank of the Canal. The numbers have decreased in the southern section, but have increased considerably in the northern section, or on Palestine Lines of Communication, and East Force.
The total strength of the corps now is 51,000 labourers, distributed as hereunder:		Non-			Officers.	commissioned	Privates.	Other ranks.		officers.

Steps were immediately taken to recruit and attest men for this grading who in all cases volunteered for the period of the war.The men were selected from British and Allied subjects, the greatest care being exercised in selecting men with a knowledge of the languages necessary. Altogether some 470 non-commissioned officers have been attested, equipped and drilled in Hadra and Rocla depots, and reports on their work from the various camps to which they have.been drafted are so far satisfactory.Owing to the large numbers of native labourers employed in the canal zone, it became evident that additional police control would be required.The raising of a police force was entrusted to the Egyptian Labour Corps, and authority was given on 19th April, 1916, to raise a force of 260 men, with the necessary officers.The duty of this force was the issue and control of passes to cross the Marine Canal and to guard pontoon bridges.This force has grown considerably and is now employed for guarding stations and camps on Palestine lines of communication and the villages of Southern Palestine. The present strength of the force is 1,000 men.It is interesting to note that in Mesopotamia Egyptian Labour Corps men have been selected, trained and formed into a police force for policing Baghdad.Salonika draft. A specially trained company for railway construction was requested for work at Solonika.Company No. 70 was selected and trained for this work and embarked for Salonika in March last. The company was up to establishment, and favourable reports are being received.French draft. During January, 1917, an application was made for the services of Egyptian Labour Corps for France, and it was decided to send 18 companies, having a strength per company of: 3 officers, 11 non-commissioned officers, 660 men.Companies Nos. 71 and 72 embarked on 23rd March, 1917, and arrived safely at Marseilles. Later Companies Nos. 73 to 84 have embarked, and Nos. 85 and 86 are standing by for orders. It has been decided that the remaining three companies, viz., 87, 88 and 89, will not leave Egypt owing to the lateness of the season and the difficulty of obtaining transport Reports from France are so far satisfactory.Cadets.-Authority was obtained on 14th February, 1917, to invite applications from suitable non-commissioned officers and men of other units to apply for commissioned rank in the Egyptian Labour Corps. A school for the purpose of teaching selected cadets Arabic was organized. 209 cadets passed through this school, out of which 128 were selected and finally obtained temporary commissions on probation, General List, for duty with the Egyptian Labour Corps.Maltese Wing. The Classification Committee, whose object it was to obtain information of British subjects living in Egypt, forwarded large numbers of names for interview, and Egyptian Labour Corps officers interviewed all British and Allied subjects wishing to serve. A large number of men came forward, who were of little value unless drilled and disciplined.The Egyptian Labour Corps &quot; Maltese Wing &quot; was organized with a view of giving discipline to this class of man.  *Jfhe men were invited to attest for the period of the war as soldiers and under the usual conditions and pay.Although Is. a day did not prove attractive, the prospect of obtaining promotion to the non-commis-sioned officer foreman rank for service with the Egyptian Labour Corps did appeal to Europeans of Allied nations, and altogether 1,043 men have been attested, trained and are now serving with the Egyptian Labour Corps in Egypt or overseas.The privates remaining in the wing are working in exposed positions in Palestine, and are well reported on.Large numbers of the Old Zion Mule Corps attested for service, and are proving useful men.An interesting feature is that Egyptian Labour Corps labourers who have been working with the corps for various terms during the last two years are now offering their services for the period of the war for this wing, with the knowledge that the work will Jake them into exposed positions.
Administration.With a unit which has developed from 500 to 51,000 the question of organization and administration I:as proved one of considerable anxiety. The corps has been reorganized under the company system, which provides for an establishment, viz.: Headquarters, General Headquarters ..       ..   Officer commanding, adjutant, officer i/c indentsand staff.Base Office, Alexandria........Officer commanding, officer i/c pay duties, officeri/c records.Branch Headquarters   ..      ..      ..   each    10,000 men.Camp Headquarters     ......each    1,200-1,800 men.Company ..      z.       ..      ..      ..   each    600 men.Distribution Camp.Eecruiting Camps &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.&quot;The advantages expected to accrue from this reorganization are: (a.) An authorized establishment (b.) Mobility of companies, (c.) Regimental system of accounts, (d.) Permanent Reises (headmen), with promotion. This is expected to help recruiting, as men will re-volunteer for their old companies, (e.) Organized recruiting depots, which will allow recruiting to be continuous and not spasmodic (on receipt of indents for labour), as previously.Equipment and rations.Various scales of equipment and rations were laid down for Egypt in summer and winter and for the men serving overseas, which were ample and much appreciated by the men.During summer in Egypt and overseas the men wear a neat khaki uniform, consisting of shorts and a smock, with &quot; E.L.C.&quot; worked in red letters on the chest. A suitable head-dress and boots are supplied when the climate or work necessitated them. During winter an ample supply of underclothing is allowed and a militaiy overcoat. When men become time-expired, these articles are returned to store, disinfected and re-issued.Rations have proved ample, but a complete systems of canteens became necessary, and have been established to supply the men with every possible want. Sanction has been obtained for the profits from these canteens to be used as compensation for dependents of men who have lost their lives or have been disabled whilst serving in the corpe.Work completed.Western Frontier Force. Coastal Section. At Matruh and Sollum Egyptian Labour Force personnel have laid a Decauville, built blockhouses, erected sheds, quarried stone, cut roads and constructed piers, where thousands of tons of stores, equipment, guns and armoured cars were unloaded. On one occasion 900 tons were landed and stacked by 150 men in a day. Captured female camels were broken in and formed into a transport unit, which accompanied the column to Sollum, carrying all the stores necessary for the defence of the advanced base.The corps also provided stretcher-bearer parties at Matruh in connection with the engagements there. Samalut. Shusha.   Blockhouse line to Baharia was constructed.Kharga. Skilled men have constructed the water dump. After a recent collision the line was cleared by Egyptian Labour Corps men and communication with Egypt re-established, thus enabling supplies to be brought up in time for the troops in the oasis.Canal Zone. With the exception of some private contractors working on roads up till July, generally speaking all the labour for the Army has been supplied by the Egyptian Labour Corps on the east bank of the Canal. Supply and Ordnance DepSts have been worked by Egyptian Labour Corps men. Sanitation of camps has been done by special gangs under the supervision of Sanitary Section, R.A.M.C., and the great bulk of the work of R.E. services has been performed by the Egyptian Labour Corps. A large proportion of huts, stables, messes and recreation rooms have been constructed by the carpenters. It is interesting to note the number of different trades required to keep an Army in motion, viz.: Carpenters, blacksmiths, tinsmiths, rivetters, platelayers, tent-menders, wheelwrights, masons, quarrymen, stonecutters, plumbers, bakers, engine-drivers, stokers, wood-caulkers, boatmen, pipehands, painters. Egypt was able to supply all these trades.Southern Canal Section (including No. 1 and No. 2 Sections). Egyptian Labour Corps have completed practically all the inner and second line defences. Men working at Shallufa filled and laid on an average 150 sandbags per man per day. Pipelines have been laid at all posts, all roads maintained, many new ones constructed. A narrow gauge railway has been constructed between El Shatt, Quarantine and Ayun Musa, and extensions of existing lines at other places. Owing to the advance in Southern Palestine and the clearing of the enemy from the Sinai Province, work in the Southern Canal Section has diminished to a considerable extent.No. 3 Section or Palestine Lines of Communication and East Force is an exceedingly large area extending from Kantara to the &quot;front&quot; in Palestine.. During the early summer of 1916 the Egyptian Labour Corps was employed and in fact made every permanent trench east of Kantara.The 12-inch pipe line was carried out to Romani and the metre gauge railway constructed.Later in the summer the important work of building the Romani Redoubts was undertaken and completed by these men. The men soon understood rivetting and wiring, and although they were constantly bombed the work proceeded without delay.Taking into consideration the climate of Romani in July, it is doubtful if British troops could have done the work as well or in the time required.The men came under fire freely on 4th August. They were also employed as stretcher bearers and were well reported on. .It is gratifying to know that these men on returning to their villages re-enlisted after a few days, and in fact a large number new look on the construction of defences as their profession.Laying the pipe line from Kantara to the defences in Palestine for a distance of 160 miles is perhaps the most important work yet done by the Corps.
The work of laying the pipe line can be divided as below : 1. Discharging pipes from steamers and loading them on rail trucks.2. Discharging pipes from trucks and transporting to the pipe line, often on the shoulders of men. 3. Cutting a way for pipe line through sand hills and filling in low levels to carry the pipe. 4. Laying the pipe and connecting it. 5. Covering the completed pipe line.The total weight of pipes so handled is approximately 12,000 tons. The A.S.C. largely employ Egyptian Labour Corps men.At Kantara depot over 2,300 men are continuously employed in discharging steamers brought alongside the dep3t and in loading trains for the advanced depots and dumps at the front.The work usually goes on day and night and after three months the men certainly require a rest.At the advanced dep6ts and dumps Egyptian Labour Corps men are also working by day and night. The work is well organized. It is interesting to watch a train steam into a depot, to see the men spring on the trucks and in the shortest possible time the empty train steams out again.A service by sea is also maintained to a beach in Southern Palestine where Egyptian Labour Corps boatmen, stevedores and men discharge stores from transports into surf boats and from the boats to the beach.As there is little or no surf boating in Egypt the work at first was not good but the men soon learned what was required, and the average tons (weight) discharged increased to 31*6 tons per hour over a period ; the best day&apos;s work being 628 tons with 18 boats.Defence work. After the battle of Romani on 4th August there was a great deal of cleaning up to do and the defences to repair and complete.The pipe-line layers were always working in advance of the defence workers but El Abd, Mazar, El Arish and Rafa were fortified by the Corps, without difficulty or outside help.At El Arish materials were carried long distances by the men through heavy sand without complaiut, and it is geueral thought that the men take an interest in their work.Ordnance Department. During the latter part of 1916 and to date the Egyptian Labour Corps has been employed in ordnance depots, and as various tradesmen were required it was necessary to specially train men for this service.It is anticipated that the men so employed will prove of great, value to Egypt after the war.Ammunition is now discharged and stored in dumps by Egyptian Labour Corps men at a cost of bd. per ton, average weight per man per day being &apos;3 tons.Pay and Records. The development of the Corps from 500 men to over 50,000 in 18 months has put a great strain on the Pay and Record Departments at the Base Office, Alexandria.Each mau when recruited is paid 100 piastres advance, and he probably receives two advances during his period of service and the final payment on discharge. The Records are kept on a modified Army system but provides sufficient detail to allow of the relatives of any man being communicated with immediately in case of casualties. It is interesting to note that no soldier or Englishman of military age is employed on the clerical staff of the Corps.Egypt has contributed her man power towards the prosecution of the war and without in any way interfering with the cultivation of the country. This has only been possible owing to the fact that the woman and child power had been so splendidly developed in pre-war days.APPENDIX IV.CAMEL TRANSPORT CORPS...  January, 1916 to June, 1917.1. General remarks. At the end of December. 1915, orders were given for the raising of two Camel Transport Corps, each of 10,000 camels. At this time, there was in existence on the canal, one company of about 800 camels fully equipped and with its full personnel. This was at once raised to 2,000, the strength fixed for the establishment of the new companies, and the Ministry of Interior commenced the purchase of camels on a large scale. By the end of February, the strength of the companies reached 18,923 camels; this has since been increased and the present number is about 33,594. Companies were organized and marched out of depot as follows :-&quot;A&quot; Company, in existence on Canal Zone.&quot; B&quot; Company, 13th January, 1916, to (Janal Zone.&quot;C&quot; Company, 17th January, 1916, to Mobile Column, Sollum.&quot;D&quot; Company, 10th February, 1916, to Canal Zone.&apos;;E&quot; Company, 5th February, 1916, to Canal Zone.&quot;F&quot; Company, loth February, 1916, to Canal Zone.&quot;G&quot; Company, 21st February, 1916, to Canal Zone.&quot;H&quot; Company, 1st March, 1916, to Western Frontier Force.&quot;1&quot; Company, 1st March, 1916, formed at Suez.&quot;K&quot; Company, 1st July, 1916, to Canal Zone.&apos;-L&quot; Company, 11th September, 1916, to Canal Zone.&quot;M&quot; Company, 26th September, 1916, to Canal Zone.&quot;N&quot; Company, 14th September, 1916, to Canal Zone.&quot;0&quot; Company, 6th October, 1916, to Western Frontier Force (in relief of &quot;C&quot; Company, to Canal Zone).&quot;P&quot; 3rd November, 1916, to Western Frontier Force. &quot; Q&quot; Company, 4th February, 1917, East Force. &quot;R &quot; Company, 20th April, 1917, East Force.These animals were all clipped and dressed for mange three times before being sent out to work.
Since the beginning of the year, &quot;P,&quot; &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;R&apos;&apos; Companies have been sent &quot;to East Force. &quot;H&quot; Company has been brought in from the Western Frontier Force and reorganized at Kantara, the Western Frontier Force being supplied with transport from No. 1 Depot in detachments at Baharia 200 camels, Matruh 250 camels and Sollum 250 camels. &quot;0&quot; Company which is composed of female camels has been transferred from the Western Frontier Force to the Canal Zone.2. British personnel. Of the officers who joined at the formation of the Corps, one had had six months experience with the hired transport companies and one for a month. The first companies that were formed, were officered by officials who were lent by the Egyptian Government and from gentlemen who had been some years in Egypt in business, and though they had no military experience or knowledge of camel transport, they had the advantage of knowing the language and the natives. A year&apos;s experience has proved that for the successful working of transport with native drivers, a knowledge of this kind is very necessary. The officer commanding company and adjutant should always have local knowledge. About 50 per cent&apos;, of officers were recruited locally.3. Native Personnel. When the corps was formed native drivers were recruited from the villages of Upper and Lower Egypt,on a three-months&apos; contract. Their period of engagement has now been extended to six months, which has greatly improved the efficiency. They have continued to work well and their conduct has been very satisfactory. The past six months have been very trying, but their behaviour under fhe in all cases have been exemplary. Several instances have occurred of natives showing particular devotion to duty, and these have been rewarded under No. G.R.O. 2491, dated 23rd May, 1917, Over 380 have been admitted to hospital from wounds from camel bites, about 70 of whom have lost a limb. At present the total native personnel employed numbei s 20,000.4. Classes of Camels.-Eight classes of animals have been received (1.) Delta heavy camel. (2 ) Upper Egypt camel. (3.) Sudan camel. (4.) Indian Camel Corps.(5.) Somali camel. (6.) Egyptian female camel. (7.) Western desert camel. (8.) Algerian camel.The best animal up to date has been the heavy Delta baggage camel, the better class of Sudan camel has also done well, but he takes a long time to acclimatise. The Indian camel, though given time to acclimatise, was a failure, and they had a very heavy casualty list, though not hard worked. The Somali camel soon settles down, but his carrying capacity is small, being limited to 250 lbs. The female camels have done well, what little they have had to do, but in this case also their value must be put to a longer test. 4,078 Algerian camels have been received as remounts. The majority of these camels are small in size compared with the heavy burden Egyptian. They arrived in the country with very heavy long hairy coats and very soft in condition. The majority of them have not yet been put to work, so that it is impossible to say as to whether they will be a success or not.The dealing with mange has been a continual trouble, but it has been most successfully treated. The camel is a difficult and delicate animal to work, and casualty lists in all campaigns in which he has been used have been very high. Over 30,000 camels were worked during the first 11 months of last year, and of these 1,473 died, 202 were killed in action, 189 sold owing to injuries, and 7,741 admitted to hospital; and though the number of hospilal cases seems large, it should be borne in mind that hardly 50 per cent, of all camels were received with clean backs. There has been a marked decrease in the number of casualties during the last six months, it being reduced to 2-4 per cent, during the month of May. The casualties of animals killed in action has increased, 188 having been killed during that period. A certain number of casualties occurred at two periods owing to excessive hrat.5. Equipment. Beyond 750 Egyptian Army pack-saddles which were issued to the first company, no saddlery was available from the Ordnance Depot. Camels began to arrive quickly and contracts were entered into for the supply of 20,000 saddles, but owing to difficulties of wood and rope not being available, both contractors failed to supply anything like the required numbers. Camel purchasers were asked to purchase the native saddle with the camels. This was done, and in this way some 10,000 saddles were received, but all had to be overhauled, retied, pads restuffed, girths, breastplates and cruppers renewed and made from any rope that could be procured, and as a rule it took two saddles as received to make one strong enough for military transport work. This overhauling and remaking of saddles was undertaken in workshops at the Camel Depot and in workshops of departments of the Egyptian Government. The great advantage of these saddles was that they were made of seasoned wood; they were put in serviceable condition at an average cost of P.T. 20 per saddle, and all have given 12 months or more hard work and a gi eat many are still being used. During the year several types of saddles have been experimented with, and we have as a result two sizes of saddles which are working well. The Indian pattern saddle did excellently for the Indian camel, but owing to the different shape of the Egyptian camels back, is unsuitable for that animal Experiments were also tried with the captured Turkish saddles with unfavourable results. An improvement has lately been made in girths to enable them to be tightened at any time when the camel is loaded.Headcollars. The Egyptian Army pattern is the only practical one; others were tried, but were not successful. Last wiater sacks were used as rugs, but this year a camel rug made from old blankets and sacks by the Ordnance Department is being used with some success.6. Loads. The average load carried was 350 lbs. over very heavy desert on the eastern side. The marches in most cases were not long, but owing to operations, the animals at times remained loaded for long hours.  Of good camel grazing there was at first very little, but lately some good grazing has been reached.
