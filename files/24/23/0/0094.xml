MEMORANDUM ON GERMAN WAR AIMS.1. Three Possible Issues.There are three possible issues of the war: -(1) An issue which involves a net loss for the Central Powers:(2) A draw, which, apart from the losses in men and treasure suffered by the several belligerents, restores the status quo of July 1914 :(3) An issue which leaves the Central Powers with increased territory.The first kind of issue, the only one which could be satisfactory to us, is still universally treated in Germany as unthinkable. No party or individual is willing in any public utterance or writing to contemplate it.\ 2. A status quo Peace.There are unquestionably numbers of people to-day in Ger-many who would welcome a peace on the status quo ante basis, a draw, in which no belligerent Power occupied any territory beyond that of which it stood possessed in July 1914, and, in respect of the material losses incurred during the course of the war, each side (in words attributed to Scheidemann, but repudiated by him) &quot; bore its own burden.&quot; But it is impossible to say how far this view has spread among the people, because naturally where it exists, it has had small opportunities of public expression. The Social Democrat &quot; Minority &quot; was till lately the only Party which made it a part of its professed programme. The more central part of the Social Democrat &quot; Majority,&quot; whose mind is expressed by Scheidemann, have also now declared in favour of a status quo peace. But the proportion of the German people which has come to adhere to the &quot; Minority &quot; or to the views of Scheidemann cannot be known till new elections take place in which those now at the front record their votes. During the last few days (July 8) it appears that the bulk of the Centre Party in the Reichstag has come over to the &quot; no annexations and no indemnities &quot; formula, whereby a status quo peace now has the support of a substantial majority of members of the Reichstag.It is obvious that if the German people ultimately come to accept a net loss as inevitable, they will pass to that frame of mind through the intermediate stage of a willingness to accept a status quo peace. It is to be expected that if the war continues to go against Germany, offers to conclude a peace on this basis wall be made, when the pressure reaches a certain point.3. The Five Ideas.Apart from Social Democrat &quot;Minority&quot; circles, there is general agreement that whatever the issue of the war, somehow or somewhere, it must bring Germany a balance of gain. When, however, the question is raised in what direction this gain is to be secured, there is a notable conflict of views. Five, to some extent rival, ideas govern the German &quot; war aims &quot; : 1. Sea-Power plus Annexations on the West.- The annexation of the Belgian coast and, if possible, a good strip of the adjoining French coast is represented as an essential condition of Germany&apos;s future sea-power. The same group which demands sea-power and the harbours on the North Sea demands also the annexation of the French mining districts (Briey) and the French frontier fortresses (Longwy is now the fortress specified).   There seems noa  (33)3531   Pk 14  250  8/17  E &amp; S A
theoretical reason why the demand for sea-poAver and the demand for Briey and Longwy should always go together, hut so far in Germany the two demands have been found to go together as a single scheme. Possibly in the future a group in Germany may arise, which demands Briey and Longwy without demanding Belgium and sea-power, but up till now the party which lays stress upon sea-power and the party which demands annexations in the West has been identical:2. Mittel-Europa, i.e., the constitution of a Central European bloc of Allied Powers, politically, militarily, and economically associated, under German leadership (in the first instance, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Poland, and Bulgaria) :3. Berlin-to-Bagdad, control of the Ottoman Empire : 4. Colonies, i.e., an African Empire, reaching acrossthe Continent from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic :5. New land on the East, i.e., annexations of Bussianterritory (Courland, Lithuania) for agricultural colonisationby Germans.4. Competition between the Ideas.It may be doubted whether there are many people in Germany to-day who think it possible that all the five ideas will be realised  or at any rate realised as a result of this war. There is no one German programme; it is a case of choosing which of the five ideas to pursue and which to let go. Hence we find a variety of programmes according to the combination selected. To some extent even those who hold the same body of ideas, distribute the emphasis differently, and are apt to guard jealously the ideas they especially champion, against the competition of the others. This is true even of the Pan-Germans. In foreign countries, for in-stance, Mitteleuropa is commonly spoken of as essentially a &quot; Pan-German &quot; idea. If, however, we use the term Pan-German in the strict sense, for the body of opinion represented by the Alldeutsche, the Alldeutsche Verband, these people continually disparage the Mitteleuropa idea, as a proffered substitute for the/ Sea-power idea, which is for them the all-important one. Nor is it only that different groups distribute the emphasis differently; it is that the vicissitudes of the war give now to one, now to another, the chief prominence in public discussion and in the press.5. The Memorandum of the Six Associations.During the first 7 or 8 months of the war, little was said about &quot; war aims.&quot; So long as the German people expected to win a sweeping victory, the discussion did not seem called for. It was the protraction of the war which gave urgency to the question of what concrete ends the people was fighting to realise. If it could not get everything it might once have wanted, what was to be marked out as the indispensable ? Besides this in the earlier months of the war, the Government had issued a prohibition against the public discussion of war aims (Kriegsziele).In March 1915, reports were current of approaching peace negotiations, and especially of a separate peace with England, in which concessions were to be made to British demands. Jingo circles in Germany grew uneasy as to the Governments firmness of purpose. Eive of the great Economic Associations of the Empire presented to the Imperial Chancellor a memorandum, dated March 10, embodying what they considered the essential objects to be secured by Germany in the war. The five associations were the &quot; Agrarian League &quot; (Bund der Landwirte), the &quot; German Farmers&apos; League&quot; (Deutsche Bauembund), the &quot; Central Asso-ciation  of  German  Industrialists&quot;   (Zentralverband   deutscher
classes: University professors and Oberlehrer     -      -      - 352Artists, writers, and booksellers    -      -      -      - 252Business men....... 182Schoolmasters and ministers of religion - 158Judges and barristers   -      -      -      -      - &apos; &apos; - 148Higher civil officials (burgomasters, &amp;c.)      -      . 145Country landowners     -      -      -      -      -      - 52Members of the Reichstag and Parliamentary bodies 40Retired admirals and generals       -      -      -      -&apos; 181,347It is said that many more signatures might have been obtained if the Government had not interposed at a certain moment and forbidden any more canvassing.In the summer of 1915, after the successive defeats of the Russian armies, when the &quot; Petition of the Professors&quot; was presented, the hopes of the Germans were flying high. The &quot;Petition of the Professors&quot; embraces more than the Memorandum of the Six Associations; it includes the whole gamut of the five ideas.   Sea-power with annexations of Erench territory &quot; alongA 2Indiistneller), the &quot;League of German Industrialists&quot; (Bund deutscher Industrieller), and the &quot;Association of the petite bour-geoisie of the German Empire &quot; (Heiehsdeutsche Mittelstandver-band). These five associations were soon after joined by a sixth, the: &quot;Central-&quot;Board of the Christian Earmei-s&apos; Associations&quot; (Vorort der ohristlichen Bauernvereine), and in May the six associations presented an amended and enlarged form of the memorandum to the Chancellor (dated May 20).The demands urged in the Memorandum of the Six Associa-,tions are- of the &quot;Pan-German&quot; type. The mark of the Alldeutsche,/as distinguished from the champions of Mitteleuropa, is that they lay stress upon the first of the five ideas annexation of territory in the &quot;West. The Memorandum declares that as the indispensable condition of the security of German sea-power, Belgium must be subjected to German Imperial Law. both in military and in tariff matters, whilst the industrial undertakings and landed property in Belgium must be transferred to German hands. In Erance the coastal districts must be retained as far as the Somme, the mining districts of Briey, and the fortresses of Longwy, Verdun, and Belfort; in these Erench districts also &quot;industrial establishments,&quot; including large and moderate-sized properties, must be transferred to German hands. This is the typically Pan-German doctrine. &quot;With this the Memorandum combines the fifth of the five ideas annexations of Russian territory on the East. It explains that since by the annexations on the &quot;West industrial Germany will have been notably increased, districts on the East must be taken in order to extend agricultural Germany and so right the balance-&quot; at least parts of the Baltic Provinces and of the lands to the south of them.&quot; As to the remaining three of the five ideas, the Memorandum touches perfunctorily on the fourth idea, the Colonies, i.e., it premises, as something which almost goes without saying, that Germany must have a colonial empire adequate to its &quot;many-sided industrial interests,&quot; but about the second and third ideas, Mitteleuropa and Berlin-to-Bagdad, it says not a word.6. The Petition of the Professors.On July 8, another Manifesto of a similar tenour was presented to the Chancellor, the &quot;Petition of the Professors.&quot; It was  signed by 1,347  persons, representing the following
the whole western front from Belfort to the coast &quot; if possible a portion of the North-French sea-board&quot; Belgium, of course, and lands for colonisation taken away from Russia, are all there, as in the Memorandum; but we have also Mitteleuropa (&quot; On the &quot; Continent in immediate connection with our frontiers as large a &quot; consolidated economic area as possible, which will render us &quot; independent of England and the other World-Powrers &quot;) Berlin-to-Bagdad (&quot; our political friendship with Austria-Hungary and &quot; Turkey must open the Balkans to us, and we must secure &quot; Austria-Hungary, the Balkans, Turkey and Nearer Asia, as far &quot; as the Persian Gulf against Russian and English greed; trade &quot; relations with our political friends being furthered by all &quot; available means &quot;), and the Colonial Empire (&quot; Central Africa &quot; by itself would furnish us with extensive territory but not with &quot; proportionate colonial profit; we therefore need adequate gain &quot; elsewhere &quot;). The &quot; Professors&apos; Petition &quot; also goes circum-stantially into the question of indemnities. It admits that the amount of indemnities Germany can get must depend upon the issue of the war &quot; if we were ever in a position to impose an &quot; indemnity upon England, no sum of money could be high &quot; enough &quot; : on Erance &quot; however severely she has had already to &quot; bleed financially through her own folly and British egoism, a &quot; high war-indemnity must be pitilessly imposed&quot;; from Russia an indemity might well be exacted in kind.In Radical and Socialist circles the Pan-German propaganda created irritation and alarm, but it continued active. An &quot; Inde-pendent Committee for a German Peace&quot; was formed in 1915 under the direction of the historian, Professor Dietrich Schafer (himself associated with the Pan-German League) to educate the public. In the daily press the Pan-German ideals were put forward by the Conservative and National-Liberal papers, such as the Kreuzzeilung, the paper of the Prussian Junkers and higher military circles, by the Rheinisch- Westfdlische Zeitung, the paper of the big armament firms, by the Tagliche Rundschau, the Sam-burger Nachrichten, the Deutsche Kurier, and especially by the Prussian agrarian paper, the Deutsche Tageszeitung, which the fire-eating Count E. Reventlow uses as his rostrum.A chief organ of the Pan-Germans is noA\r also the weekly, Das grossere Deutschland, which till the end of 1915 was edited by Rohrbach and Jackh.7. The Pan-German Scheme.If Germany was to become so strong a power on the seas as to put an end to Great Britain&apos;s predominance on that element, then it was not only necessary for the German navy to be increased, but also for Germany to possess ports on the North Sea, outside the &quot; wet triangle &quot; (the Bight of Heligoland). A t the beginning of the Avar, when the Germans had hopes of pushing their conq uest of the sea-board much further to the west, Calais and Boulogne were among the harbours they had in their mind; latterly, for obvious reasons, we do not hear much of the Erench harbour-towns in this connection, but&apos; the Pan-Germans and other annexationists continue to affirm that Germany must at all events never let Belgium go, since without the Belgian ports they could not have that access to the open sea which is necessary if they are really to &quot; hold England by the throat.&quot; They would also need, for the purposes of sea-power, naval stations at different points in the line of maritime traffic, such as Great Britain possesses in Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, &amp;c. Sea-power, presupposing the annexation of Belgium and the Erench mining districts (Briey), has been during the war for the Pan-Germans the thing of supreme importance. Their hero is Admiral Tirpitz, whom they would like to substitute for Bethmann Hollweg in the Chancellorship. The chief enemy for them is not Russia or Erance, but England.   Their motto is
&quot;Porth from the wet triangle!&quot; a saying of the Hamburg shipmaster Ballin.. The increase of German sea-power is euphemistically termed by the Pan-Germans the &quot; freedom of the seas.&quot; This term has, of course, a number of different meanings; in Germany itself, it is&apos; used in certain circles to mean a modification of international law with regard to the right of capture at sea, but the Pan-Germans state perfectly explicitly that what they mean by the &quot; freedom of the seas &quot; is the increase of German sea-power. The seas&apos;at present are &quot; unfree &quot; because Germany&apos;s activities in the world at large are hampered by British sea-power. To remove this impediment any paper international law would be utterly nugatory. The only way in which it can be done is for Germany to oppose in solid fact to EnglancFs sea-power a sea-power of its own. To say that Germany wants to obtain a dominion over the seas, such as Great Britain now claims, is (we are told) a slander. Germany need not even aim at having as large a navy as England. What it must do is to diminish the present disparity between Great Britain&apos;s sea-power and Germany&apos;s to such an extent that it would be a prohibitive danger for Great Britain to thwart Germany in any part of the globe.   Then the seas will be &quot;free.&quot;8. The Pan-Germans and the other Ideas.The attitude of the Pan-Germans to the other of the five ideas Mitteleuropa, Berlin-to-Bagdad, Colonies is not one of repudiation, but one of relative disparagement. They are all very well, but are mischievous in so far as they are offered to people as a substitute for sea-power. The Naumann-Bohr bach policy, which found a panacea in Mitteleuropa, was inadequate, said Count Beventlow, speaking in April, 1916. &quot; Our statesmen must &quot; not let themselves be dazzled by the phantom idea of a Mittel-&quot; europa, which we might very well create and elaborate, but &quot; which cannot take the place of sea-power for us.&quot; &quot; There is &quot; still one gross error haunting German heads. We gain, through &quot; and with our Allies, the advantages of the Berlin-Bagdad line, &quot; and that is considered enough. Let us (the cry is) turn to the &quot; South-East; we can then afford to be restricted on the West! &quot; We could then exert sufficient pressure out there upon English &quot; weak points. It would be a grievous error a fatal error to &quot; found the Ereedom of the Seas upon any group of alliances.&quot; (Kreuz-Zeitung, January 16, 1916).&quot; The enthusiasts for Mitteleuropa say : &apos; We shall secure the &quot; &apos; same thing if a strong Turkey can put pressure on England&apos;s &quot; &apos; neck, the Suez Canal! Well, there is a good deal of difference &quot; &apos; in practice between pressure upon the neck (Genick) and &quot; &apos; pressure upon the throat (Gurgeiy&apos;.&quot; (Karl Graf vonHolstein, in the Europdiche Staats- und Wirtschaftszeitung, July 21, 1916.)The position of the Pan-Germans is that, if they acquire the necessary sea-power, all the other desirable things, such as colonies, will be added unto them, whereas if they fail to acquire the necessary sea-power, colonies would be no good to them, would indeed only constitute hostages at Great Britain&apos;s mercy. With sea-power, therefore, with the annexations in the West, the whole future of Germany stands or falls. Even the &quot; Professors&apos; Petition &quot; says: &quot; He who desires to obtain colonies at the price of giving &quot; up our security against English sea-tyranny on the coast of the &quot; Channel, of giving back Belgium, not only under-estimates the &quot; value.of a sure foundation at home in Europe-a value exceeding &quot; that of all colonial possessions but he also commits the grievous &quot; political error of trying to get colonial possessions without &quot; security on the sea-ways, possessions dependent, as before, upon &quot; England&apos;s good or evil will.&quot;A 3
9. The Pan-German Campaign.The publication of the Memorandum of the Six Associations was forbidden in Germany. The German papers of the time seem to refer to it with only a distant allusiveness. The &quot; Petition of the Professors &quot; was circulated as a &quot; strictly confidential lnanu-script.&quot; (It was published in the January of this year in Das grbssere Deutschland.) Yet the contents of the two documents became generally known in Germany and were a topic of heated discussion. Eriedrich Naumann wrote in July 1915 : &quot; &quot;Whilst the &quot; open discussion of war-aims is forbidden, a dangerous manu-&quot; facture of war-programmes flourishes in secret. . . . Large &quot; economic associations put forth their views as if the world lay &quot; already at Germany&apos;s feet.&quot;By August both documents had been published in foreign papers practically in full. Theodor Wolff notes this (Berliner Tageblalt, August 16, 1915), and says that &quot;it is impossible to exaggerate the harm clone to the German cause.&quot;10. Mitteleuropa and Berlin-to-Bagdad.Whilst Pan-German circles were working to rally the German people under the banner of the first of the Five Ideas, concurrently the gospel of Mitteleuropa and Berlin-to-Bagdad was being preached by those who bore the label of &quot; Moderate.&quot; If it seems strange that such an epithet should be applied to the exponents of such ambitions, it must be remembered that both Mitteleuroim and Berlin-to-Bagdad could be realised with practically no alteration of the map as it was in July 1914. It was only needful that Germany should unite more closely its allies; Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, under its leadership, and the stretch of one organised Power from the North Sea to the Persian Gulf was made a reality.The idea of Mitteleuropa had been in the air before the book of Friedrich Naumann appeared in the middle of October 1915. In May 1915, for instance, the eminent jurist, Franz von Liszt, published a pamphlet projecting for the time after the war a closer union between the Continental States, for which Germany and Austria-Hungary were to be the nucleus,,and which was ultimately to include even France, Spain and Portugal. The League was to counterbalance Russia on the one side and the British Empire on the other. Then the eloquent writer, Eriedrich Naumann, ex-pastor, Christian-National Socialist, publicist, editor, Member of. the Reichstag, constituted himself the chief apostle of the idea. His book Mitteleuropa (translated into English under tlie title &quot; Central Europe &quot;) written with imagination, colour and fervour, stirred the hearts of many in Germany and attracted the attention of the outside world. It is undoubtedly one of the most notable literary products of the war. One may refer to it as the standard expression of the Mitteleuropa gospel.The basis of Naumann&apos;s gospel is to some extent sentiment rather than reason-the sentiment of kinship between the Germans of the Empire and the Germans under the Habsburg crown, the sentiment of comradeship begotten by the association of Germany and Austria-Hungary on a hundred battlefields in this war,&apos; the sentiment attached to the memory of the Holy Roman Empire and medieval Germany, the imaginative suggestion of the terms &quot; Kaiser &quot; and &quot; Reich &quot; ! But it has also a rational theoretical basis. Naumann&apos;s fundamental thesis is identical with- that of Seeley&apos;s in &quot; The Expansion of England.&quot; It is that under the conditions of the coming time, no State will be able to hold its own as a perfectly independent Power unless it has a certain territorial extent, unless its population reaches a certain figure.   The day of
small States is over. Every small State, even if nominally, inde-pCndent, is destined to be drawn within the orbit of one or other of the World-States. Seeley drew from this the conclusion that the old England was not large enough to hold its own unless it expanded into the British Empire. Naumann draws the conclusion that the, German Empire, with its 60 odd millions of people, is not large enough to hold its own against the World-States unless it expands into Central Europe. The existing World-States are the British Empire, Russia and the United States. Germany alone cannot stand on the same footing with them, but the Central-European bloc, in which the German race would have the hegemony, would be large enough to do so. &quot; The question shortly,&quot; says one writer of this school, &quot;is whether there are going to be three World-States or four ? &quot;So far the considerations determining Mitteleuropa are those of Macht (Power), Le.&apos;, are political and military. There is also the economic factor. The pains which have been suffered by Germany in consequence of its oversea, exports being cut off have made the idea of Germany&apos;s becoming the part of an economically self-subsistent Continental area a very attractive one. It is anti-cipated that in the days to come the great World-Powers will all be exclusive economic spheres, protected by tariff walls against foreign competition. Here too, Germany alone could not be self-subsistent, but Central Europe plus Bulgaria, plus the Ottoman Empire, shut off from the outside world as a single economic sphere, would no longer need to dread any maritime blockade.Eurther, as has been noted, it is contended that this complex of Allied Powers, led by Germany, could always bring effective pressure to bear upon Great Britain through its neighbourhood to the Suez Canal. &quot;We need only wait for the moment when an &quot; adequate railway line has been laid across Asia Minor and Syria &quot;to the Egyptian frontier, and the English will give up their &quot; game of disregarding German interests.&quot; (Rohrbach). &quot;The &quot; main ganglion of the British Empire is Egypt and the Suez &quot; Canal. If Turkey comes out of the war a strong State and &quot; provides itself with railways, England can never go on holding &quot; Egypt with 6,000 European soldiers. And if England loses the &quot; Canal, all the bands connecting its Empire are loosened. Even &quot; the Central Government in London might grow insecure, and &quot; what then &quot; ?   (Delbriick.)11. Rohrbach and the Committee for an Honourable Peace.Mitteleuropa and Berlin-to-Bagdad belong together as two parts of a single scheme. Whilst Naumann is the chief exponent of Mitteleuropa, Paul Rohrbach, known before the war as an active Imperialist writer, is the chief exponent of Berlin-to-Bagdad. Up to the end of 1915 Rohrbach was associated with the Pan-Germans on the editorial staff of Das grossere Deutsch-land, but he then split away from them and together with other &quot;Moderates&quot; started a new weekly, Deutsche JPolitik. When some foreign writer spoke of Rohrbach as a Pan-German Impe-rialist, he accepted the appellation &quot; Imperialist,&quot; but denied being a &quot; Pan-German.&quot; Berlin-tc-Bagdad is indeed, as we have seen, the &quot; Moderate&quot; rival to the Pan-German programme of Sea-power. The bitter campaign against Bethmann Hollweg which has gone on for the last two years, has been carried on by the Pan-Germans; the ex-Chancellor had the support of the &quot; Moderates.&quot; The Imperialist wing of the Social Democrat Party, whose organ is the SozialisticJie Monatschefte, has been at one with the &quot; Moderates &quot; in enthusiasm for the Berlin-to-Bagdad idea, and in fidelity to the Government against the Pan-Germans. After Bethmann Hollweg had denounced his Pan-German traducers in his Reichstag speech of June 5, 1916, a society wTas formed by the &quot;Moderates&quot; toA i
carry on a work of enlightenment, by popular lectures, in support of the Government; it was known as the &quot; German National Committee for the Preparation of an Honourable Peace.&quot; Naumann, Rohrbach, and Delbruck, and some &quot; Majority&quot; Socialists (Siidekum, Eendrich) were prominent amongst its members. This indicated a withdrawal of the prohibition against the open discussion of war-aims, and enabled the Pan-German &quot; Independent Committee for a German Peace,&quot; which had been working for a year, more or less secretly, to come out into the open. Which of the two societies had the largest backing it is hard to know. But it may be conjectured that while the &quot; Moderates &quot; included a number of distinguished Intellectuals, the Pan-German propaganda made a much wider appeal in upper-class and middle-class circles, certainly in the commissioned ranks of the Army and Navy. It is significant that in 1915 the Pro-fessors&apos; petition had been able to get 1,347 names, when canvassing was stopped by the Government, whilst Delbruck, who got up a counter-petition of &quot; Moderates,&quot; was able to secure only 141 names. We cannot base on this a conclusion as to the state of feeling a year later, when the gospel of Mitteleuropa and Berlin-to-Bagdad had been given much wider popular vogue, yet wre may note that whilst the &quot; Committee for an Honourable Peace &quot; sinks out of public notice within a few weeks of its inception, the &quot; Committee for a German Peace &quot; continues active till to-day.12. Contradictions between Pan-German Theory and the Mitteleuropa Gospel.There are certain salient contrasts between the Pan-German and the Mitteleuropa doctrine. Por the Pan-Germans, who face towards the West, the chief enemy, as has been said, is England. Eor the school of Bohr bach, which looks towards the South-East, the chief enemy is Russia. The irreconcilable enmity of Germany and Russia was based by Rohrbach, before the Russian Revolution, on the clashing interests of the two peoples with regard to the Bosphorus and Dardanelles. It was an absolute necessity for Russia, if it was ever to be a great Power, so Rohrbach taught, to possess Constantinople and the Straits; it was an equally vital necessity for Germany to keep Russia away from them. There was no possible accommodation; it was simply a question of German strength butting against Prussian strength. Since the Revolution, although the Provisional Government has apparently renounced any exclusive claims to Constantinople, Rohrbach has not let his Russophobia go. He has kept up a steady sceptical criticism of the optimistic views as to the future Russia which the Russian Revolution spread through Germany. The Russian danger has not really been removed.Again the Pam Germans continually assert, with all possible emphasis, that a peace on the status quo basis, a &quot; Scheidemann peace,&quot; would mean an utter defeat for Germany and a triumph for England. The Rohrbach school maintains that a peace on the status quo basis (although something more is to be hoped for) would mean a complete defeat for England ; Germany would have secured everything that was vital. Eor England everything turns upon whether she can break the alliance between Central Europe and Turkey. &quot; EnglancPs poor prospects will not be substantially &quot; changed, even if the war (instead of ending in a German &quot; victory) has what, according to English ideas, would be an &quot; &apos; inconclusive &apos; end.&quot; &quot; If at the conclusion of peace, England &quot; has failed to achieve all this [the disruption of Turkey and the &quot; limitation of Germany&apos;s submarine activity] then, according to &quot; her own confession, she will have lost the war.&quot;It is sometimes explained that if Germany contrives to come out of this war with Mitteleuropa a reality, and the connection
with an intact Ottoman Empire unbroken, Germany will have got the necessary basis for further expansion later on. The solid stretch of power from the North Sea to the Persian Gulf is not to be regarded as something finally adequate, but as a secure foundation. No blockade will be formidable; no assault of outside enemies will imperil Germany any more; no one will be able to hinder her while she organises herself for the next advance.We may notice an extension of the Mitteleuropa idea which has come up in certain quarters; for instance, in the Sozialistische Monatshefte. This consists in dropping the Mittel; it is not only Central Europe which is now seen in visions of the future consolidated against the outside world, but Continental Europe as a whole. In these quarters, there is hope that even Erance may be won; Erance may be brought to see that her true interests lie in her joining the European bloc and not in alliance with the Island Kingdom. The Imperialist Socialists who collaborate in the Sozialistische Monatshefte (Schippel, Jansson, Kranold, Miiller, Quessel) have always (in striking contrast to most enthusiasts for Mitteleuropa) been notably friendly to Russia. They forecast a time when the whole of Central and Western Europe will be a solid aggregate of Powers, in friendly understanding with Russia, united against the British Empire of the Seas. With the entrance of the United States into the war, the antithesis of the future becomes that of Continental Europe to the &quot; Anglo-Saxons.&quot;13. The Colonial Empire.We come to the fourth idea, that of an oversea Colonial Empire. It does not appear that those in Germany to-day, who put oversea colonies in the first place, are numerous. Eor the Pan-Germans, as was said, colonies go without saying, when once Germany has the necessary sea-power. Eor the Mitteleuropa school colonies are an adjunct and extension of Berlin-to-Bagdad. There is, of course, a group of colonial enthusiasts, represented by the Kolonial-gesellschaft, whose interest is mainly centred on the fourth of the five Ideas. Occasionally, one still meets with utterances to the effect that Germany must get back all her colonies, even the Pacific ones. But this does not seem the general view. Kiao-chao and the colonies in the South Seas have almost universally been given up as lost for good. On the other hand, there is a widely-expressed anticipation of getting a much larger African empire than was possessed by Germany before the war. It is a common thought that Germany made a mistake in the past in acquiring colonies haphazard all over the world instead of aiming at one large continuous dominion. In Africa there is room for such a dominion. Germany will have, of course, to get back East Africa and the Cameroons, and must have the Congo State as well, and the other territories which lie between them, so that one unbroken tract of German power will extend over the whole central part of the African continent.It is rather the &quot;Moderates&quot; than the Pan-Germans who expatiate upon this future African Empire. Delbruck talks about the &quot; German India &quot; in Africa, and Rohrbach gives it a place in his propaganda second only to Berlin-to-Bagdad. If indeed the English could ever be got out of Egypt and that country made once more a part of the Ottoman Empire, the territories belonging to the Central European bloc would be actually in land-contact with the German African Empire and the necessity of sea-power, upon which the Pan-Germans insist, would be proportionately diminished. A &quot;German India&quot; in Africa belongs indeed to the same order of conceptions as Mitteleuropa; in both cases, what the &quot; Moderates &quot; have in their mind is a definite tract of continental territory within which Germany commands, whereas the Pan-Germans want to see Germany, ina  3531 B
virtue of its sea-power, carrying through its will all over the globe. &quot; Our&apos;field is the world &quot;-also a saying of Ballin&apos;s-is a phrase they&apos;habitually play off against the ideals of limited continental dominion characteristic of the &quot; Moderates.&quot;The reasons for which, a colonial empire is. declared to be essential to Germany are commonly given as (1) The increase of power ; and (2) Economic necessity.The reasons sometimes given in very ill-informed circles . in England, viz.: that Germany needs territory outside Europe for her surplus population, is not commonly adduced in Germany, except occasionally by a chauvinistic minister of religion or some -one whose view of the world is more emotional and imaginative than drawn from the knowledge of facts. In Germany it is generally realised (1) that Germany has ceased for some 25 years to have any considerable surplus population, (2) that the startling fall in the German birth-rate makes it doubtful whether Germany will have in the near future any considerable surplus population, (3) that, even if Germany had any surplus population, it is questionable whether a white race could settle and thrive in any part of Central Africa.But it is urged that the possession of Central Africa would be a substantial increase of German power. The German Colonial Empire of the future, we are told, is not going to be left as defenceless as the German colonies have been in this war. They will be abundantly provided with munitions and their black man-power turned to account under German organisation. &quot; The &quot; black garrison-troops in the Cameroons and in German East &quot; Africa have given such excellent account of themselves under &quot; the leadership of German officers that one may affirm confidently: &quot; if Central Africa becomes German and our former colonies are &apos;: given back to us, German Central Africa, adequately supplied &quot; with munitions, could hold out for the longest war. The larger &quot; this German colonial empire is, the more troops will it be able to &quot; furnish, the more risky will an attack upon it be for our enemies, &quot; and the more enemy troops will our garrison-troops keep engaged &quot; in Africa in the event of war.&quot; (Eranz Kolbe in Deutsche Dolitik for December 22, 1916. It is to be noted, however, that the German Colonial Secretary, Dr. Solf, in his speech of June, 1917, expressed his readiness to adhere to the demand of General Smuts, that the formation of,black armies should be prohibited.) It has been pointed out that according to the Berlin-to-Bagdad scheme, Germany would haye it in her hand to cut Great Britain&apos;s com-munications with the East by the Suez Canal. Some writers have pointed out that if Germany possessed ports on the West Coast of Africa she could also make Britain&apos;s alternative route to the East by way of the Cape insecure. Central Africa, in fact, stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic, would, in the event of war, form a basis from which the bands of the British Empire could be altogether broken up. Hence the accession of power which its African Empire would bring to Germany would be far from negligible.In the propaganda for the Colonial Idea in Germany the chief prominence, especially when Social Democrat circles are appealed to, is given to the economic consideration. It is shown how German industries depend upon certain raw materials imported from the tropics, rubber, &amp;C. If the Central European bloc is to be self-sufficing, it must, therefore, have an extension in the tropics. With an African adjunct, everything Germany needed for its economic welfare would be produced in territory within the German sphere of power.   It is represented as likely in the future that all
the great World-States will be enclosed by tariff walls. A good deal is made of the resolutions of the Paris Conference in this connection. If Mitteleuropa is to hold its own in such a world, a tropical empire is a necessity for it.14. Annexations in the East.There is lastly the fifth Idea Annexations in the East at the expense of Russia. This, as was stated, was combined with the first Idea in the Pan-German semi-secret memoranda of the summer of 1915. But the demand for annexations1 in the East is not characteristically Pan-German. Hans Delbruck, one of the most moderate of the &quot; Moderates,&quot; one of the most emphatic opponents of annexations in the West, who, in April 1915, wrote regretfully in his &quot; Bismarcks Erbe,&quot; that there was no longer any empty land left in Europe for the best sort of colonies^-peasant colonies  admitted that he had changed his view after the German advance into Russia. He wrote in the Preussische Jahrbiicher in November 1915 that Germany could no more think of giving back Mitau and Riga (the second of which, as a matter of fact, the Germans have never taken to this day), than she could Strassburg. Even Scheidemann was understood before the Russian Revolution to be not averse from annexations in the East (he is now against all annexations). It is contended that to extend the territory of the Empire over the Russian Baltic provinces is a real expansion of Germany, an expansion of the German people as well as of German dominion, of the sound peasant stock upon which the whole fabric of the Empire reposes. With a broadening of the foundation, there is the possibility of a more imposing superstructure, of a greater German world-power. (A proposal sometimes made in Germany is to colonize the Baltic provinces by inducing the large German colonies now settled in the farther parts of Russia to migrate to these regions.)15. Opposition of &quot; Minority &quot; Socialists to all Five Ideas.Such are the five Ideas, one or more of which we see in all the German programmes which look for some gain as the result of the war. To all of them the Social Democrat &quot; Minority &quot; are opposed, because they see in them all nothing but capitalist imperialism. If the annexation of any territory beyond that possessed by Germany in July 1914 is ruled out and it is expressly ruled out by the &quot; Minority,&quot; and now by the Scheidemann section too-then the first and the last of the five Ideas at once fall to the ground. These Socialists contend that any annexation of fresh territory would make the war a war of conquest instead of a war of defence, and, if so, no further argument is needed against either the annexation of Belgium or the annexation of Courland.But adverse criticism of the five Ideas has not come only from Socialists. There is, as has been pointed out. a certain rivalry between the Ideas, and adverse criticism of one of them often comes from the eager champions of another.16. Criticism of Pan-German Scheme.To begin with the first Idea, the Pan-German Idea of annexa-tions in the West. This is adversely criticised by Delbruck, who stands both for the African Empire and for annexations in the East. In the Preussische Jahrbucher for Eebruary 1917, Delbruck takes hold of the favourite Pan-German formula for the annexation of Belgium that it must continue attached to the German Empire &quot;in a political, an economic and a military sense.&quot; Political?. Even if Belgium were prohibited from having formally accredited representatives of its own, Germany would be unable to preventB 2
Belgium carrying on by hidden ways an independent policy. Economic ? A Zollverein, so far from producing a union of hearts, would, according to all experience, lead to friction and hostility. Military ? Even if the Belgian army were trained by German generals, Germany would have no guarantee that the Belgians would not turn against her, when it came to a war. If there were a Belgian army, isolated German garrisons would be at its mercy; nor would it be feasible to keep the whole Belgian army in Germany. Belgium in the permanent occupation of the German troops would mean permanent martial law an inconceivable thing. No, the only way of really attaching Belgium to Germany would be to incorporate Belgium altogether in the German Empire and embody the Belgian troops in the German Army. But that no one surely in Germany can desire.And as to the possession of Belgium being necessary for purposes of sea-power, Delbruck says that he knows a good number of naval officers who do not believe that the Elemish coast has any very essential value from the point of view of naval strategy. &quot; That &quot; increase of power which we must seek, and Avhich will make us &quot; secure, Ave must exert ourselves to win in the East alone.&quot;In a more recent number of the same periodical (June 1917) Delbruck writes : &quot; Supposing that either by victories on land or &quot; by the submarine Avar, Ave so far brought England down that, in &quot; spite of the help of America, she gave up further fighting and &quot; Avas Avilling to concede us a direct or indirect dominion over &quot; Belgium, even so we ought to say : &apos; Not Belgium, but Africa ; &quot; &apos; not the coal fields of Charleroi, but Nigeria; not Zeebrugge, &quot; &apos; but the Azores, Madeira, and the Cape Verde Islands; not &quot; &apos; Antwerp, but Lagos, Zanzibar, and Uganda, and Gibraltar for &quot; &apos; Spain.&apos; Is it true that we should get no enjoyment out of &quot; a colonial empire, that we should be only in the position of &quot; &apos; precarious tenants&apos; unless we permanently kept England &quot; intimidated by our possession of the Elemish coast ? There &quot; can be no more baseless superstition! Even suppose the &quot; U-boats failed to end England&apos;s sea-hegemony for good in this &quot; war, even suppose England remained permanently our superior &quot; on sea-even so, that Central-African Germany would be strong &quot; enough in itself to repel every attack from outside. Has not &quot; our East Africa, as it is, maintained itself for nearly three years &quot; Avith nothing but its own diminutive forces ? But Ave should so &quot; equip our African empire with A\reapons and munition factories &quot; and depots that it would be able to hold its own against a Avorld &quot; of enemies. By means of our mercantile U-boats, it would even &quot; then remain in communication with the home country, supposing &quot; the English were once more complete masters of the open seas. &quot; A certain number of war U-boats stationed there Avould &quot; even defend the islands and their harbours against English men-of-war .... But ought we, perhaps, to aim at getting both the Colonial empire, and the dominion over Belgium ? &quot; That would be to fall into the error of Napoleon I. He, too, &quot; aimed at acquiring a great colonial empire for Erance. But, because lie simultaneously extended the Erench frontiers in &quot; Europe, he in the end lost both.&quot;A similar line was taken by the Colonial Minister, Solf, in those lectures of his in the summer of 1916, which brought upon his head the Avrath of Eeventlow.&quot; Even should we fail both to win control of the seas and to get the principle of a mare liberum established, even so, whatever the sceptics may say, no sentence of death would have been passed upon our colonial policy. And this is by no means to preach a colonial policy &apos; by England&apos;s favour.&apos; It is not Germany alone which possesses oversea ! &quot; colonies. Other nations do so too, and are not troubled about England&apos;s dominion over the seas.    Neither the
United States of America nor France nor Italy nor Holland nor Japan have ever thought of giving up their colonies because then respective fleets are not strong enough by themselves to command the seas. Moreover, England&apos;s sea supremacy is not an indefeasible prerogative; at the present moment, it is shared with the combined French, Russian, and Japanese fleets. &quot;We ought to be able to make some day as strong a coalition against England as she has now made against us.&quot; (Solf, as reported in the Weser Zeitung, June, 1916.)17. Criticism of Mitteleuropa.The second Idea, Mitteleuropa, does not come under the Social Democrat condemnation of annexations, bufit is condemned by them, because they are opposed to the idea of mutually exclusive economic areas. They still are faithful to the principle of Free Trade, and also consider such protective systems incompa-tible with international friendship. But Mitteleuropa is also regarded suspiciously from the opposite, Pan-German, quarter. The Pan-Germans dislike Naumann&apos;s gospel for two main reasons : (1) More than any other party, they represent &quot; Nationalism &quot; in the sense that word has to-day in Germany, i.e., narrow jealousy for the predominance of the German race and the unadulterated German tradition. Naumann has taught that, for the constitution of the Central European bloc, the German must be prepared to fuse more or less with other Central European peoples, to develop a Central-European, as distinguished from an exclusively German, consciousness, to adapt himself to the sensibilities of Bulgarians and Turks. This idea of the German type being blurred in a nondescript Central-European type is hateful to the Pan-Germans. (2) According to the gospel of Mitteleuropa the Central-European bloc is to be strong as a group of allied States, whereas the Pan-Germans hold that it is a wrong line to seek to build German greatness on any system of alliances. Germany must be strong in its own strength.Further, the economic side of Mitteleuropa has been looked at with disfavour in some of the high business circles in Germany. The remarkable series of articles which appeared in the Frankfurter Zeitung in May, 1916, expressed the views of such circles. Ger-many, it was insisted, could not sacrifice her world-market to an Austro-Hungarian system of preferences. Herr voa Gwinner, the chief director of the Deutsche Bank, also showed himself cold to these projects. The German specialists in economic theory did not give them much encouragement. Several of those who contributed to the composite book edited by Professor Herkner (Die wirtschaft-liche Anndherung zwischen dem deutschen Reich und seinen Verbundeten), the most important study of the subject which has appeared in Germany, arrived at conclusions similar to those of the Frankfurter Zeitung articles. All this economic criticism of Mitteleuropa in &quot; bourgeois &quot; circles is taken up and enforced by the Social Democrat &quot;Minority.&quot; &quot;The real motive behind the &quot; Mitteleuropa movement,&quot; writes a Socialist economist, &quot; is, as &quot; Rohrbach frankly admits, not economic, but military and &quot; imperialist. Manufacturing states do indeed strive toward &quot; association with agricultural states, but for two manufacturing &quot; states like Germany and Austria, to form a Customs Union, &quot; would be economically monstrous.&quot; (&quot; Spectator &quot; in Die Neue Zeit, May 19,1916.)18. Criticism of Berlin-to-Bagdad.The third Idea, Berlin-to-Bagdad, i.e., the German control of the Ottoman Empire, is disparaged, as has been seen, by the Pan-Germans in so far as it is offered as a substitute for sea-power.B 3
Pressure on the neck of the British Empire is not equivalent to pressure upon EnglancTs throat. .- Utterances from such circles are also apt to speak of the Turks with cavalier depreciation, which Bohrbach or Naumann would carefully avoid. &quot; A good deal also &quot; depends upon who exercises the pressure-. With all respect for &quot; the military achievements of Turkey in this war, no one can &quot; deny that there is a mighty difference between the German &quot; Empire and Turkey.&quot;   (Karl, Graf von Holstein.)We also find the idea disparaged by an enthusiast for the African Empire, like E. Zimmermann. He is anxious to show that the German expectation of .what Turkey could furnish economically has been pitched much too high. Hence, for the supply of what Germany needs, an African empire is indispensable. -&quot; * !- - -   -   -19. Criticism of the Colonial Idea.The fourth Idea, Colonies in the tropics, is adversely criticised by the Social Democrat &quot; Minority.&quot; So far as it is the increase of power upon which the necessity of colonies is based, these Socialists see in them only a form of the imperialism against which they fight. So far as it is the need of German industries for raw materials, they Contend that it matters little whether the things which Germany needs are produced in territories politically annexed to Germany or not. Whether, in the event of war, a. country can be cut off from its sources of supply depends not on whether those sources are within tlie sphere of its sovereignty before the war, but on whether they are accessible or not to the enemy. Erance, for instance, is now cut off from the mining districts of Lorraine. Similarly, if an enemy cut the lines of communication between Germany and Africa, Germany&apos;s African Empire would be able to furnish it nothing. Stress is also laid upon the statistics which show the growth of German trade before the war in countries under the British flag. Behind the demand for colonies, writers of this school say, is no real economic need, but a mere childish craving for prestige. &quot;If the others have colonies, Germany must have them too.&quot;Outside Socialist &quot; Minority &quot; circles, however, no one dares to indicate publicly that a peace could be contemplated, which did not give back Germany its former colonies, or their equivalent. On the other hand, one may question whether there is much spontaneous enthusiasm for the colonies among the people as a whole. The colonial group is eager and vocal, but according to one of the editors of the Berliner Tageblatt in an article he contributed to a book recently published &quot; it would appear that &quot; during the war the idea of a colonial activity on the part of &quot; Germany has not gained many adherents. At home one may &quot; now often hear the words: &apos; What is the good of colonies to &quot; Germany when they can so easily be taken away in war ? &apos;&quot; He goes on to say that soldiers write home from the front, that they are well enough able to defend the home-country, but that oversea dominions are merely hostages given to the enemy. &quot; These ideas are becoming increasingly general.&quot;20. Annexations in the East become Delicate Subject.Lastly, the fifth Idea of annexations on the East has, of course, been very much affected by the Russian revolution. Scheidemann and his following now definitely exclude such annexations from their scheme of peace. So long as there is any hope of detaching Russia from the Allied cause, it is obvious that the idea of annexing Russian territories requires delicate handling.
21. The Ex-Chancellor.With these five Ideas in various combinations occupying the public mind, what has been the line of the Government? It is plain that the Pan-German view is widely diffused in high military and court circles, but it is also plain that the Chancellor himself, who was till lately upheld by the Kaiser, refused to give the Pan-Germans the assurances they require. A venomous pamphlet and press campaign was persistently carried on by certain Pan-German circles against Bethmann Hollweg. After the presentation of the Memorandum of the Six Associations to the Chancellor in May 1915, he had a sharp correspondence. Though strongly pressed on every side, Bethmann Hollweg avoided identifying himself with any of the opposing parties. The formula he used was that of &quot;guarantees.&quot; &quot;We must hold out till we &quot; have created and won by fighting all possible real guarantees &quot; and securities that none of our enemies, either alone or com-&quot; bined, will ever again dare to enter the lists of war with us.&quot; (May 28, 1915.) &quot;We hold in our hands very valuable gages &quot; (Faustpfande). .... I cannot say what guarantees the &quot; Imperial Government will demand in the Belgian question, what &quot; concrete factors of power it will consider the necessary basis for &quot; this guarantee. Yet there is one thing of which our enemies &quot; ought to assure themselves: The longer and the more bitter the &quot; war is which they wage against us, the greater must be the &quot; guarantees which we demand. .... Neither in the East &quot;nor in the West must our enemies of to-day have gates of &quot;-invasion at their disposal, by which they may again threaten us &quot;in the&quot; near future, and threaten us more grievously than before. &quot;It is well known that Prance lent money to Russia only on the &quot; express understanding that Russia would build its Polish for-&quot; tresses and railways against us, and it is equally well known that &quot; England and Erance regarded Belgium as a territory giving &quot;them facilities for hostile approach. Against this we must &quot; secure ourselves both in the political and the military way, yes, &quot; and in the economic way too.&quot;   (December 1915.)&quot; We shall create for ourselves real guarantees that Belgium does not become an English-Erench vassal state, is not constituted, in the military and in the economic sense, a rampart against Germany.&quot;   (April 1916.)These expressions of the ex-Chancellor&apos;s were claimed both by the annexationist and by the Social Democrat opponents of annexation, as signifying agreement with them. According to the Social&apos;Democrats &quot; gages &quot; are essentially things ultimately given back. The controversy between the two views went on in the Reichstag and in the country. The Socialists claimed that the Chancellor&apos;s silence, when their interpretation of his utterances was given in his presence, implied consent. The Chancellor was said to have declared in a private meeting that his silence did not imply consent. In June 1916, Scheidemann announced that a year before he had had an interview with the Chancellor after the memorandum of the Six Associations had been presented, when the Chancellor had told him with his own lips that he emphatically repudiated these plans for annexation, and disapproved of all such plans. A &quot; Minority &quot; Social Democrat immediately pointed out that if. the Chancellor had said &quot; these &quot; plans, &quot; such &quot; plans, that need not mean that he disapproved of all plans for annexation.It was about this time that the Committee for the Preparation of an Honourable Peace; was formed with the special purpose of supporting the Government, and no doubt with the Governments encouragement. As against the Pan-German scheme for annexa-tion on the West, the Committee for an Honourable Peace was predominantly &quot;composed of the exponents of Mitteleuropa, Berlin-to-Bagdad, and the African Empire.   We may infer that it wasB 4
not displeasing to the Government at that moment that the popular mind should he turned rather to the &quot; Moderates&apos; &quot; pictures of the future than to the Pan-German ones. But we cannot infer that the Government intended to commit itself definitely to any one of these ideas any more than to a particular policy as to Belgium or as to the pursuit of sea-power. If indeed the negotiations between Germany and Austria-Hungary for a special economic accommoda-tion, which we have been repeatedly told were about to take place, had ever really got under way, the German Government might have had to commit itself to a particular policy with regard to Mitteleuropa. So far, however, the uncertainty of Germany&apos;s economic position and the failure to arrive at a fresh Ausgleich between Austria and Hungary have prevented the adumbrated negotiations between Germany and Austria-Hungary from taking substance. *22. Government Peace Plan in 1916.A great change was brought about by the military events in the year 1916, viz., the failure of the Germans at Verdun and the joint offensive on the Somme.   The result of this is seen in the German proposals for peace negotiations.   These were determined on at the end of October, i.e., at the time when it became apparent that they would no longer be able to hold their original line.  The object, therefore, clearly was to start negotiations at the time when the enemy territory occupied by Germany  (including Rumania) was at the greatest extent, and before retreat of any kind had begun.   No indication was given as to the terms which the Germans would propose except that (1) they would be based on the German military success, and (2) that they would be very reasonable.   We might, perhaps, assume that they would offer in return for the restoration of the German Colonies to vacate Prance and probably to restore the kingdom of the Belgians, subject to Belgium coming into a permanent alliance with Germany.   The establishment of a Kingdom of Poland under German or Austrian protection would certainly have been included, and also considerable extension of Bulgaria.   Whatever the details may have been, the object would certainly have been, under a probably conciliatory form, to secure the complete political, military, and commercial supremacy of Germany on the Continent.23. Present Situation.Since that time, the continued pressure, both military and economic, has completely changed the situation. The question is now in fact not-what are the war aims which Germany will impose before she grants peace, but what terms she herself would be willing to accept. There is no doubt that the Government are anxious at the earliest moment to get out of the war on any terms which will secure them against revolution at home and national collapse.The Paris Conference, followed by the entry of the United States and many of the South American Republics, has put economic matters into the foreground. The German Government must obviously view with extreme apprehension the situation at home in the months immediately succeeding the declaration of peace. The physical exhaustion of the people and of the country, combined with the want of food, which cannot be immediately remedied, and the want of raw material for starting manufactures will create a most serious situation. If when the troops come back from the front, it is not possible immediately to start again the industrial life of the country, and provide them with food and* Since the above was written a statement in the London evening papers (July 24) makes it appear that the negotiations are being begun.
24. The Government waits on events.Whilst the Government itself keeps in the dark background, refusing to forgo its untrammelled opportunism, which will allow it ultimately to throw itself in the direction of whichever of the five Ideas seems the easiest to realise according to the development of the military and economic situation, it no doubt finds both the Pan-German propaganda and the Scheidemann propaganda useful in different ways. The extravagant demands of the Pan-Germans are useful in view of future bargaining ; the higher that anticipa-tion is screwed up in enemy countries of what Germany desires, the wider margin will the German Government eventually have for making proposals which have the air of concessions; on the other hand, the Scheidemann campaign against annexations is useful, in so far as it conciliates Socialist and Radical opinion in the enemy countries, and enables persons of pacifist tendencies in those countries to argue for concessions to Germany on the ground that Germany&apos;s demands are really quite moderate. There is no reason to think that when the time comes for the German Govern-ment to formulate its demands, they will be any more moderate than is necessitated by the pressure of force majeure.E R B15th July 1917. J.&apos; W. H.Postscript.The above memorandum was written before the resolution passed in the Reichstag on Thursday, July 19th. The discussions that took place in connection with this event and the comments on them in the press are of great importance in connection with the matter of war aims. From them it appears that the members of the Reichstag who, in this matter, probably represent general German opinion, fall into three large groups.   The Majority,a   3531 Cwork, there will almost inevitably be a very dangerous revolutionary movement; this will be started by the Minority Socialists, but if Germany comes out of the war without a definite increase of strength and prestige in some form or another, the influence of the Government in the middle classes will be so much weakened that it will be impossible any longer to depend on their active support against a revolutionary movement. The Prussian military and agrarian party remains as firm and uncompromising, in domestic as in foreign affairs, as ever, and many of them will undoubtedly prefer civil war to any surrender which would deprive them of the political power which they regard as then right.For this reason, that which the Government probably most regards is security that, as soon as the war is over, there should be a free flow of food and raw material into the country, and at the same time, free markets for German produce. If this could be secured, the energy of the people could be at once directed to the restoration of commerce and industry and their interests so con-centrated on this that they would be turned away from dangerous political considerations. But in this connection it has now become apparent that all which is included under the formula Ilittel-europa, even in its greatest extension, i.e.t commercial control over South-Eastern Europe and Western Asia, will not be sufficient; there must be free and favourable commercial inter-course with the rest of the world, and especially an adequate supply of tropical products from Central Africa, wool and cotton from America and Australia.
consisting of the Centre Party, the Radicals, and the Majority Socialists, have agreed on the following resolution: &quot; As August 4 will he the threshold of the fourth year of war, the German nation endorses the words contained in the speech from the Throne: &apos;We are not animated by the lust of conquest,&apos; Germany took  up arms in order to defend liberty, independence, and territorial integrity. The Reichstag stands for peace and understanding and for the lasting conciliation of nations.   Annexations, political, economic, and financial oppressions are contradictory to such peace.   The Reichstag rejects all plans which aim at economic separation and the instigation of hostility amongst nations after the war.   The freedom of the seas must be guaranteed.  Only an economic peace will prepare the soil for friendly relations between nations.   The Reichstag will energetically foster the creation of the organisations  of international law.   As long, however, as hostile Govern-ments do not accept such a peace, as long as they threaten conquest and violence against Germany and her Allies the German nation to a man will be united and will stand unshaken, fighting until right of existence and evolution are secured for it and its Allies.   The German nation in its unity is invulnerable.   The Pteichstag knows that it agrees in this respect with the men who, in a heroic struggle, are protecting this country.   The lasting gratitude of the whole of the nation is assured to them.&quot; Here, then, we have the majority of the Reichstag formally dissociating themselves from the policy not only of annexation, but also of war indemnities, if this is what is meant by &quot; financial oppression,&quot; and from those vaguer plans for the forced union, for instance, of Belgium, with the German system, described by the late Chancellor, under the elastic expression &quot; guarantees.&quot;It is probable that strong influence was brought to bear on these parties not to insist on passing this resolution; they were, however, sufficiently strong to adhere to it, and it has been accepted by the new Chancellor, with the saving qualification, &quot; as I interpret it,&quot; thus:&quot; First of all, the territory of the Fatherland is inviolable. With an enemy who demands parts of our Empire we cannot parley. If we make peace we must in the first line make sure that the frontiers of the German Empire are made secure for all time.&quot; We must by means of an understanding and give-and-take guarantee  the conditions of existence of the German Empire upon the Continent and overseas.   Peace must build the foundation of a lasting reconciliation of the nations.   It must, as is expressed in your resolution, prevent the nations from being plunged into further enmity through economic blockades, and provide a safeguard that the league -   in arms of our opponents does not develop into an economic offensive alliance against us.   These aims may be attained within the limits of your resolution, as I interpret it.&quot; The resolution was strongly opposed by the Conservatives of the Right and the Pan-Germans, who have bitterly deplored it as weakening the German cause; and, notwithstanding the long negotiations, the majority of the National-Liberals  refused to accept, and the whole Party voted against, it.   The Conservatives and the National-Liberals therefore refuse still to dissociate them-selves from annexationist plans.On the other side, the Minority Socialists have refrained from identifying themselves with the middle or moderate party, pre-sumably for the reason that they refuse to accept the position that
the war was one which was forced upon Germany and has been carried out for defensive aims. There is little doubt also that they would accept the principle of a plebiscite for Alsace-Lorraine, and possibly also for the Polish provinces of Prussia.That which is of chief interest in this new grouping of parties is that some of those, especially the Centre, who are now apparently ready to go back to the status quo of July 1914, in previous dis-cussions accepted the principle that there should be an enlargement of the countries of the German Empire, and accepted also the late Chancellors formula of guarantees, including, as this certainly was intended to do, the military, political, and commercial control over Belgium. Nor must we even now be too ready to conclude that all those who voted for the resolution were really against all annexations. It seems to be agreed, both in the Conservative and the Radical press, that the majority behind the peace resolution is &quot; only formally &quot; homogeneous, and the &quot; Centre understands by it something different from that which Social Democrats do&quot; (Frankfurter Zeitung, for July 19, 2nd edition). In a meeting of the Centre Party at Rottenburg, Botz, a member of Reichstag, explained that the Peace Resolution &quot; did not exclude Germany&apos;s &quot; acquiring extension of territory in different places, nor did it &quot; exclude Germany&apos;s getting an indemnity (schliesse nielit aus, &quot; dass Deutschland da mid dort dock G-ebietserweiterungen bekomme, &quot; sie schliesse auch nicht aus. dass es auch eine Kriegsentschddigung &quot; erhalte).&quot;E R B25th July 1917.
