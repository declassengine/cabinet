SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information,CRW/018.Weekly Report on Russia.   XVIII. (August 20th, 1917.)The Government of the C.W.S.P.One of the most important factors in the political situation is the attitude of the C.W.S.D. towards the new government, and vice versa.     There is no Joubt that the government itself, though still largely composed of Socialists, is more to the Right than the old government for the reason that the Socialist Ministers are no longer the mere puppets of the C.W.S.D..     At the same time there is as yet no sign $hat the government will openly oppose the C.Y/.S.D. on anv fundamental question.     The raison d&apos;etre of the government is that it is a national and not a party government, but thafact remains that never did party feeling run so high in Russia as it does at the present moment, and it is difficult to say that the new government is above party feeling.     There is little doubt that Kerenski himself has risen entirely above party feeling, especially since the disasters on the South-Western front.     Eis one object is to save Russia, and he would squash the C-^S.]). to-morrow if he thought this was necessary in order to save Russia.     The same may be said of Tereshchenko and Ifekrasov, who now both style themselves as/non-party, but it is certainly not trua of all the members of the government a,s for example Chernov.     Thus the presence of Chernov in the government is the best ino.ica.tion that Kerenski and his immediate followers do not yet consider it advisable, in the interests of Russia, to break with the CW-S.D., and it is not likely that the present government will move any further to the ,
/I 7 QRight so long as Chernov remains.     Kerenski is probably relying on Tsereteli to keep the C.W.S.D. in as close touch as possible v/ith the government and it is inlikely that he will do anything in the early days of his new Ministry that would put a strain on the loyalty of the CW.S.D..     It is this which Will in all probability very largely influence Kerenaki*e attitude towards the Stockholm Conference, which is still ver^ strongly desired by the C-W.S.D..The CW.S.D. is faced with an extremely difficult situation. It has suffered a very serious loss of prestige owing to the military defeats, and if the defeats continue further it may suffer still more heavily.     The Cadets lose no opportunity of pointing out the mistakes the C.W.S.D. has made during the past few months, with the result that the latter feels itself in direct antagonism with the bourgeoisie as a class.     This makes still more difficult the position of the extreme Left of the bourgeoisie who are trying to bring bourgeois and socialists together.    The attitude of the Left of the bourgeoisie is particularly interest-ing.     They are insisting on the lessons taught by the military defeats and urging the Socialists to profit by the failure of the Maximalist campaign.     As the object of that campaign was the overthrow ef the Coalition Cabinet and the seizure of power by the C.V.S.D., the first lesson of their failure is that a Coalition government is absolutely essential, and that the actions of the CW.S.D. must always be guided by this consideration.     This is the link between tho Socialists and the bourgeois, and it is Tsereteli&apos;s object to maintain that link.     The chief difficulty, however, is the connection which still exists between the C.W-S.D. and the Maximalists.    That link will still be preserved (1) so long as the Cadets and other parties to the Right refuse to conceal their open hostility to the Socialists in general, and (2) until the leaders of the Maximalists are proved to be corrupt.     But until that
happens 4he Maximalists will increase in numbers, especially in jbe factories, and the C-W.S.2). will refuse to cut themselves adrift from them.     As Kereask^e main object is ts keep the country united, it is essonti.il to him to keep the link with -While doing nothing to flout the Cadeta. The Socialist Press.Since the Maximalist rising Pravda 1ms been suppressed and presumably the whole Maximalist provincial press has suffered the same fate with the exception of the papers published in Finland. The result is that Maxim Gorki!s paper Nor ay a Zhizn now finds itself to the extreme Ltft and does not appear to realise- the position.    This paper has been strongly anti-English and has been moterate Maximalist, but has never had the courage to take the bold line adopted by ffravda, and its influence ia not very great. For example when the Russian offensive was launched on July 1 it had not the courage to oppose it, and since tht- Maximalist rising it has been distinctly wobbly.     Gorki remains so popular as a writer that violent attacks on him are not a great success.    More-over his pacifism, to judge by tht- ton&amp; of his articles, is of a sentimental character.     Of the other Socialist papers the Rabochaya Qazeta, the organ of the Minimalists, is strongly supporting the government, while Pyelo ffaroda, Chernov*s organ, is following suit less willingly.    The most interesting change is in the attitude of Dyen, which now calls itself Socialist.     It represents the extreme Left of the bourgeoisie, and is trying to form a link between the middle classes and labour.    While rubbing in the lessons of the military failures, it is sympathetic to the CW.S.D. and is ready to make terms with the Cadets so long as they sink their p*xrty feelings.The Ukrainian Question.There has been no new development in the Ukrainian question * as the centre of interest has botn transferred from Kiev to the
front-     The agreement concluded with the Rada by Tereshchenko and Tsereteli is still being attacked by the Cadets, who maintain that the Provisional Government acted prematurely and exaggerated the strength of the Ukrainian movement.     Since the German offensivs Petlyura, the Ukrainian Minister for War, has issued an appeal to the Ukrainian troops to resist the enemy, and the Rada generally appears to have adopted a firm line.     At the same time it is not impossible that the Ukrainian leaders are reinsuring themselves with Germany in case the German army succeeds in overrunning the country. Reports from Switzerland state that Archbishop Szeptytki on the way from Russia to Rome passed through Switzerland, where he conferred with Erzberger, the German Catholic, and with a represent-ative of the Austrian government.     It is said that Szeptycki has been delegated by the Ukrainian government to conclude an agreement for a separate peace in the event of the- occupation of the Ukraine by the German armies. Finland.The Finnish position is still unsatisfactory, and there are signs that the Socialists mean to resist the order of the Russian government for the dissolution of the Diet.     The key to the situation in Finland is the food question.     Finland is not self-supporting and can only hope for food either from Russia or America. Provided America makes it clear that Finland will get no food supplies until she changes her attitude to Russia, she will almost certainly be compelled to give way before the approach of winter. This would be a great help to Petrograd as Finland is now the centre of Maximalism and German propaganda.In Sweden the Finnish question is boing closely followed. Sentimental feeling towards Finland, that was kept alive under the Tsar, has now almost entirely disappeared.     The only supporters of the extreme claims of the Finns are the Activists who hope for a
German landing in Finland.     Thus the olearing-up of the Finnish situation would be a great help to the pro-JSnjJSnte elements in Sweden.R.A.L.20/ /l?.
