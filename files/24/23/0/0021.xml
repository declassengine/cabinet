ft   /?     Of(AhA, ml hi/4935.War Cabinet. ^--&quot;dieufs letter en French military effort.^TOrnorandurr, by&quot;Ihe Secretary of State -r^r JVar.With reference to ^ar Cabinet 208(5), 1 invite my colleague to read the subjoined note by the C.1.G..S. in conjunction with M. Tardieu*s letter of which a copy is re-produced in an Appendix for facility of reference :-1.     H. Tardieu&apos;s statements in his letter to Mr. Baker respecting the present condition of the French Army and the extent of France&apos;e effort in the war, are liable to give a false impression of the actual situation in France at the present time,while M, Tardieu says correctly that the strength of men in the zone of the armies alone shows the maximua figure reached during the war, and that this figure is a little less than 3,000,000 he leaves the impression that this is the strength of the French armies in the field which is far   from being the case. Tiie effective strength, according to French figures submitted on 1st June, was only 1,873,750, and this figure includes a considerable number of men who cannot properly be classed as fighting troops. The fighting strength of the French Army, so far from increasing, has for some time past steadily diminished because owing to exhaustion of man power the great majority of divisions have been reduced from 12 to 9 battalions and the strength of infantry unite has also been reduced.     Some idea of the extent of this reduction may be gained from the fact that in January 1916 the French had 1,103 regular battalions of infantry on the Western Front of which 27 were sent to Salonika, whereas there are now only 1,009, while in addition a very large number of Territorial battalions have been disbanded or formed into labour unite.     M. Tardieufs comparison of;the numbers in the zone of the armies at the present date with those numbers at the beginning of the war is misleading, as the French Army did not of course reach its maximum strength for many months after the beginning of the war.2.    M. Tardieu asserts that with the resources in the depots the French can maintain their strength up to the present level for a long time to come.The following are the only reserves at present availablein FranceTrained and partially trained men 60,000now in the depots.The 1918 class now in the depots. These will be ready in Septemberor October 130,000Returned wounded per month; 5,000 to 6,000As the French estimate their wastage at 40,000 men per month, it will be seen that their reserves are inadequate to maintain their present strength in the field, for more than six months, and that a progressive reduction in that strength must take place.3.     M. Tardieu*s comparison of the extent of front held by the Britith and French Armies shows the usual error., which consists in omitting to mention that the enemy has far more men to the yard on the British than on the French front..     Ke states that the French Army holds more than two-thirds of the Western Front, that the number of German divisions last June opposite the British front was 42, and opposite the French 81, and that a German division holds on an average 4 kilometres 700 metres, while a French division holds 5 kilometres 500 metres.While
While it is: true, roughly speaking, that the French hold two thirds, of the Western Front, about 260 kilometres of that front, between St. Mihiel and the Swiss frontier, is very lightly held and is in parts little more than an outpost line; on the whole of this front there are only: IB German infantry and 2 cavalry divisions while the French have only 15 infantry divisions. The number of German divisions opposite the British and French armies is incorrectly stated; they were last June 56 and 90 respectively.     The statement that a French division holds on an average a greater extent of front than a German division is- wholly incorrect.     The French have 3.97 battalions per mile while the Germans have on the French front-2.73 battalions per mile. Presumably in this, comparison %% Tardieu is talcing the average front held by a German division on the whole Western front, but he forgets a very Important point, namely, that the enemy\&amp; strength per mile on the British front is more than double his strength on the French front.     Opposite the British the enemy has 5.5   battalions per mile to our 9.1 battalions per mile.The only true comparison is of course the relative strength of the British and French armies to the enemy on their respective frontB.     The British strength is to the opposing German strength as 1.65 to 1. while the French strength.is 1.45 to 1.    The fact that this comparison is slightly in our favour is due to the fact that we are at present taking the;chief share in offensive operations.4.     There are some other inaccuracies in the letter such as the number of heavy guns in the zone of the armies, which he puts at 6,000, while the actual figure is 4,559; and the daily output of heavy artillery is also exaggerated by some 30,000 rounds; but these are comparatively unimportant.It will be seen from the above that M. Tardieu&apos;e statements are in several important respects, wholly inaccurate, that he draws a much more favourable picture of the present and prospective situation of the French Army than is warranted by the actual facts of the case, and that his comparison of the res-pec tive efforts of the British and French Armies gives an entirely false impression of the real situation in the Western Theatre.M. Tardieu&apos;e statement appeared; in the &quot;2*Tew York Herald&quot;, Paris Edition-, of 6th instant.   : Presumably it has also appeared in the United States PresB.
i CIRCULATED TO THE KIHO AHD WAR QABIHET.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Telegram (en clair) from Mr. Butler (Hew York)R. August 7th 1917. To Colonel Buchan, &apos; .Tardieu&apos;s letter follows July 30th. Dear Mr. Baker:*I brought to your knowledge in recent talk surprise I felt in reading in American newspapers utterly inaccurate information regarding military conditions prevailing especially in French Army.     I &quot;believe it of interest to present you some figures which will show you France as she is, powerful in spite of three years suffering.     Strength in men now in zone armies alone shows maximum figure reached during war; this figure little less than three million men exceeds by over million number men actually in zone at beginning, and one must add men in zone of interior and colonies.    We are aertain with resources of Metropolitan and Colonial depots to be able to maintain that number up to present level for long time to come; our strength in men, by reason of better command and better methods of instruction, has shown since beginning of war constantly decreasing definitive casualties. Following figures substantiate this:   Battles of Charleroi and Marne casualties 5.41$ first 6 months 1915, 2.39$ second 6 months 1915, 1.68$ first 6 months 1916, 1.47$ second 6 months 1916, - 1.28 in proportion to the total mobilized strength.     Western front has extension of 739 kilometres; 27 kilometres are held by Belgians, 138 kilometres by English, 574 kilometers by French, French army holds accordingly more than two-thirds of western front where enemy has always directed chief exertion,     German divisions on western front were in June 1917 distributed as follows: 42 Opposite English, 81 opposite French.     German division holds average front 4 kilometres 700 meters, French division average front 5 kilometres 500 meters - that is one-sixth mare.     We werft amply furnished with 75&apos;S; since beginning war number of these guns was constantly increasing: it is adequate to needs.     As for heavy artillery, we had in August 1914 300 guns grouped in regiments in June 1917 we had 6,000 of them, mostly modern.     During our present offensives we have on average one heavy gun for 26 meters. If we sum up all trenoh field heavy artillery we have one gun for eight meters in sector of- attack.     Output munitions was arranged in August 1914 for 13,000 shots of 755 a day; it ie now arranged for 250,000 shots of 755 and 100,000 shots of heavy guns.     If you consider weight of projectiles shot on German trenches during one of last offensives you will find following figures for one lineal meter:   Field artillery kilos 407, trench artillerw. 203, heavy artillery 704, High Power Artillery 128, total 1,452.    H ere come figures on monthly expenditure in ammunition for 75*S: July 1916 6,400;000, September, 1916 7,000,000 October 1916 5,500,000; during last offensive expenditure was 12,000,000 shots all calibres; we completely re-equipped Belgian Serbian and Greek Armies, number of heavy guns given by us to Allies exceeds 800.    Financial effort cannot be separated from military effort; Frante has expended since beginning of war, following sums1914.     8,040,000,000 Francs 1915.   22,800,000,000     tt 1916     32,640,000,000     n 1917     19.167.000,000     &quot; TOTAL       82,647,000.000     &quot;She
She received from foreign countries from 1st August 1914 to 1st January 1917 6,000,000,000 Francs.     Durinr: same period she loaned to several Allied Governments 4,000,000,000 Francs.   Such is situation: severe was ordeal, stronger is national energy now.     It is question of striking last &quot;blow to adversary.     You will help us hut, at moment when American soldiers arrive France, it is proper to let them know that they will find country which today, as well as during last three years, hears principal exertion of our dreadful foe.     Secretary Baker!s reply 49 follows August 2nd 1917:-My dear Mr. Tardieu:-Have just read with admiration splendid account of present military strength and civil and financial effort of French people, and am glad to have your permission to publish letter in order that people of United States may have basis for admiration they have felt from first for France in this great struggle as well as re-assurance with regard to present situation.     This struggle is so vast that perhaps not strange to have occasional accounts from individuals who have seen but small fraction of situation and therefore give distorted and unjust view of whole, and (it is; fortunate so comprehensive a statement as yours can be made available for public information.     I am constantly in receipt of detailed reports from American officers in France, they are unanimous in their praise of splendid morale of French people, their superb industrial and military efficiency, and their greatness of soul in bearing, as they are bearing, almost superhuman burdens successfully under inspiration of great cause.DERBY.14th August, 1917.
