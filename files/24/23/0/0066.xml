jbIntelligence Bureau,Department of Information.BPW/013.Weekly Report on Poland. XIII. (18th August, 1917.)The recent conferences in Warsaw between representatives of the Central Powers and of the Poles dealt not only with the wider problem of the Polish government, but also with the narrower administrative question as to how the transfer is to be effected and what 1b to be the basis of future relations between the oocupying authorities and the new polish administration.    The Landrats from the German sphere of occupation under the leadership of Herr Von Kries, Chief of the Civilian Administration in Warsaw and a Pree-Conservative member of the Prussian Diet, were in favour of restricting the concessions to the Poles within narrow bounds. They are reported to have had the support of Dr. Lewald, Director in the Imperial German Home Office, whilst Governor-General von Beseler and Prince Hatzfeld favoured much wider concessions.     The final decision on the principles involved was expected to be arrived at during the visit of Herr Michaelis to Vienna.As to the political parties which are to take part in the new government, the latest news seems to indicate that the Inter-Paiffcy TJnion, the organisation of the Realistb and National Democrats, expects to see its leaders and friends, obtain some of the most ia^ortant posts in it hut wishes them to take office 4,not officially, but privately&quot;.

Prince Iiubomirski and Arch-
Military questions also seem to have been raised at the conference and a memorandum was submitted &quot;by Colonel Sikorski, late Chief of the Military Department of the Supreme national Committee of Galicia and the most prominent opponent of Pilsudski in polish military circles.    He is in favour of forming a polish army immediately, though even he and his friends demand from the Germans that the control of the Polish army shouifi be left to Polec    Yet their ideas of &quot;control&quot; are very much more modest than those of Pilsudski, and within the army itself these men are in favour of suppressing completely all political movement and discussion.It is given out by fairly reliable authorities that only about 8,000 men are now left in the Legions.    E?en this number will have to be reduced still further by weeding out the followers of Pilsudski from among the Galician Poles, who have not been put to the test of the oath.    Only the second and third infantry regiments (the so-called Carpathian Brigade, now commanded by Colonel Jaauszajtis, which during the first year of its existence was separated from Pilsudski&apos;s brigade) and the second cavalry regiment are described as reliable by Pilsudski&apos;s opponents.     The promoters of this new army-echeme profess the hope that with the help of volunteers from among Polish prisoners of war they will be able to raise the effectives of the Legions to the strength of 10,000 men, and thus to obtain by October the necessary cadres for three divisions which are to be formed by enlisting 24,000 to 30,000 fresh recruits.    The first army corps is thus to be ready by January 1918.    The new recruits are to be obtained by con-Bcription; the idea of raising volunteers is naturally becoming unpopular in &quot;moderate&quot; circles because the volunteers whom they would be most likely to get at present are revolutionaries anxious to arm themselves.    But clearly conscription could not be enacted by tha present Provisional Council of State on its deabh-bed, whilst the new government and Council are hardly likely to start their
