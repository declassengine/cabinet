From : Brigadier General Ballard.TO: D.M.I.llth AugustB.A, 678.Sunday July 29th.Following report from Major KeyesFitawilliams and I have visited 9th Army&quot; Headquarters &amp;nd 2nd Rifle Division of 40th Corps in front line.     Army, which is reported to have fought well under former commander, is now the worst on the Roumanian front.     This is largely due to power allowed t&amp; committee by the G.O.C. General Stupin. Committee at Army H-,^. at Roman is divided into sub-committees, one of which is for propaganda among Roumanians of revolutionary ideas.     It is reliably reported that Committee order detailing these sub-committees was signed by Stupin.     Committee is subsidized by Army Staff and apparently also received money fxom Odessa via Galatz..     Greater part of its expenditure is on revolutionary propaganda amongst Roumanians.     Committee&apos;recently tried to obtain footing in Army Staff.and was backed by Stupin but project; was defeated by Army Staff..     Our propaganda campaign was-welcomed, by Staffs of.Army-and 40th Corps.Morale of artillery! and death battalions excellent but remainder of Infantry deplorable.     They are very well fed, clothed and are undergoing no hardships but are hopelessly sick of war.&apos;    There .are very few old soldiers.and formation of death batt-alion ,;has further reduced good men.     Great majority are young and devoid of all :;military -feeling and swayed by many discussions in ranks-,.
