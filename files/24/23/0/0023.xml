. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE BILL,I strongly support Mr, Hayes Fisherfs Memorandum 0f the 9th instant.    The opposition of the National Health Insurance Commission I regard as nothing short of a grave scandal, and in my opinion it should not be allowed to delay the passage of this Bill.    The powers sought by the Bill are urgently necessary,iTho alternative proposals submitted by Sir E, Cornwall are indefensible.     If they came into force they would lead to overlapping and great friction; and I am confident would meet with hostility on the part of Local Authorities.RHOKDDA.MINISTRY OF FOOD.14th August, 1917.
