Jot yfnj?-*illA.B.,155/29.-ilkii,700assort to the Cabinet.ALhGeneral Policy.16th August, 1917.1,.     Lieut. Gen. Sir D. Henderson has laid before tho Board an estimate of tho number of squadrons required for ^/ork * ith the armies in the Field in the summer of 1918; the C.I.G. S. has concurred in this estimate.   The numbers required are as follows:-	Corps He-	Fightor.	Fighter Bom-		Sight	Total.	connais-		Rocon-	bores.	KLy-		sance.		nais-3an.ee ,..		ing.	B. 2.

The Field-Larshal Commanding Home Porsos has dra^n the attention of the War Office to the increased height (15,000 feet) attainable by Zeppelins of the latest design and has suggested that the machines at hiB disposal may not be able to cope 7ith Zeppelins at that height.   The V?aa? Office have referred the matter to tho Air Board for their opinion and the latter have care-fully considered the evidence as to the height v/hich the latest typo of Zeppelin can&apos;attain.   Y/hile it appears clear that no existing Zeppelin, ^-ith its full load of bombs, could attain a height of 15,000 feet, it seems to be established that after dropping its bombs the L.48 type could reach this and even greater heights.    The Board are - considering the steps to be taksn in view of this situation.    The production of a special night flying machine of improved performance has for some time been in hand and the first of these, -all shortly be ready for trial.3.     At the instance of General Squier, commanding the American Signal Corps and Mr. Coffin, the Chairman of the American Aircraft -&quot;Production Board, it has been decided to send to Washington a representative of the Air Board-to keep in close couch ^ith the American, authorities on questions of aeronautical policy and aircraft production.    Colonel Cormack, the Assistant Controller of Aeronautical Supplies has been selected for the purpose and. will leave for America in a ^eek.
4.     Colonel Yakowleff, the head of the Russian Air Service, whose previous visit was referred to in the Report dated the 2ist July, has returned from Pavis and had a further conference with representatives of the air Board. . His modified request for the supply of aircraft from British sources is still under considoration hut an agreement has already been arrived at &apos;&quot;ith him as regards the item in it -&apos;hich presents the most difficulty, namely: the supply of 50 De Havilland 4 machines.    it is hoped to be able to despatch the parts of these before the winter for assembly in Russia in conditions i&quot;hich ^ill be satisfactory to the Russians.Supply        5.     The position, nith regard to the supply of ball bearings continues to cause grave anxiety; the measures taken to increase the ho e production for aeronautical purposes will not take effect to any very considerable--&apos; extent before February, 1918.    in the interval -e shall be, to a large extent, dependent upon the luck of shipments  &apos; from Sweden and America,    it is understood that the position as.regards ball beamings for motor transport is equally unsatisfactory and that no relief can be obtained by diverting bearings from transport to aircraft.   The supply of this essential requirement of aero-ongine.....production may prove a limiting factor in the output........ of engines.6.     The deliveries of engines and aircraft have been as follows:-Total for the ^eek ending August 11th..............iiinft-ine,^. Aeroplaneb. Seanlanes.41*994Total for the month to date..................59538929Total for. July 19171221115485Total for July 1916431527* Including 25 from Prance.HOTB: Production has been very seriously reduced owing to the august holiday.(Signed) H. P. HaHOT,Secretary to the Air Board.
