Enclosure &quot;A&quot; to letter from LUnlstry of Shipping to War Cabinet 18th August; 1917. TRACT.itSince I last \vrote to you, the arrangements for the discharging of lighters with high explosives have been ameliorated, owing to tho pressure brought about by the allied local representative, and consequently the situation has been relieved to a oortain extent.   It is fortunate-, however-, that generally speaking the tonnage coming to Archangel is considerably less than last year, as otherwise there would be a Complete stoppage of work.The labour question is still unsettled, and on Saturday and Sunday week, work in the harbour was totally suspended and a great-demonstration-of all labourers from A-rchangol and surmmcLLngs. was- organised.   About 40,000 men and women from all parts assembled in Archangel, and an endless procession with hundreds of red flags with &quot;ond-the war&quot; inscriptions,-, all more or Iobb of an extreme socialistic tendency, paraded the streets-.   Fortunately the weather conditions were such that their energy received a con* eiderable damping, and the masses dispersed more or lees drenched hot to reassemble again, and took up- their work peaoefully the following morning-.The local authorities, not knowing to what excesses the demonstration might lead, were very nervous ,concerning the considerable alcohol supplies, and requested us to make arrange-ments for the steamer ST, THOMAS.to leave the port as soon as possible.Since the demonstration considerable numbers of labourers have left Archangel^ patftly owing to the lack of sufficient employment and the food difficulties, and partly to do the so necessary agricultural harvest work on the land.Notwithstanding all these difficulties, we were getting on comparatively well with the work of our -steamers, when suddenly we were informed on Monday afternoon that we Would have to stop the loading of wheat Immediately, as the export of all wheat is forbidden, and the demand was even made that the wheat already loaded in the &quot;FLOES&quot; and &quot;TYNEMEDE&quot; should be discharged.   Mr. LeBourgeois, however, succeeded in getting permission for these two steamers to leave with the cargo1loaded,, but he was requested by the Government to get the vessels out. of the harbour as quickly as possible, only giving them the additional cargo to keep the wheat from shifting.This action does not appear to have been directed by the provisional Government, but has been-forced on the local authori*-t^s by the Committee of Soldiors and; Labourers, who were urged on by the general public opinion foaring that the northern provincesit        itit9of
of Russia were not sufficiently supplied with food. It is difficult to say, at the moment, if wheat shipments will be resumed again in case supplies for this district are guaranteed. In general, however, the extraordinary cost of living and scarcity of food has made the Russian population very antagonistic towards the export of any food-stuffs from Russia, and the fact of this export has certainly not added to the popularity of foreigners in this port.

To illustrate the temperament of the people, we had yesterday afternoon quite a small excitement with regard to the despatch of the "FLORE". After all the necessary documents and official permit for leaving the port had ben received from the authorities, the pilot refused to go on board saying he had instructions not to take the steamer out of the harbour. On telephoning the port authorities, we were informed by the Assistant Chief of the Port, in the absence of his Chief, that they would not permit this steamer to leave, and that if she attempted to go out the fortress had instructions to fire on her. The matter was again taken up by the French Consulate with the Government, and at last final instructions were issued to the pert authorities, and we were able to send the "FLORE" out to the Bar last night.

Generally speaking, since the last offensive of the Russians, the situation seems to be more hopeful, although the difficulties which the Provisional Government have still to overcome to enforce their authority are tremendous, but it is certainly a good sign that everybody, with the exception of the socialistic elements which to my belief is certainly influenced by German intrigue, is trying their best to support the authority of the Provisional Government.

For the port of Archangel, and the work in the harbour, it is very unfortunate that the Assistant Governor and head of the Russian Transport Department, Captain Strahowsky has been removed from his post owing to intrigues. Captain Strahowsky has held this position practically since the outbreak of the war, with great ability, and the change now will be certain to have an adverse effect on the general work at Archangel.

The general rise in the cost of living in Russia is enormous, and has more than doubled since last year. For your information I am enclosing a table comparing the prices of 1915 and 1917, which shows an approximate average increase of living amounting to about 500%, and even then the prices of 1915 in most cases show a considerable increase to pre-war prices.

ENCLOSURE &quot;B&quot; TO LETTER FROM MINISTRY OF SHIPPING TO .WAR CABINET 18th Augustj 1917.Estimated Imports in August-December, 1917.(Memorandum by Statistical Advisers to the Ministry of Shipping.)The striking increase in the recorded imports in July, following upon certain important changes of administrative policy which have been recently effected, hae necessitated the re-examination of the position as to probable imports during the remainder of the year.The gross tonnage now engaged in mercantile work appears to be about 7-j million tons against rather lees than 6j- million tons estimated for the present time in our report of 21bt May.   The difference, which has arisen in the: intervening three months, is attributable to various oauses of which the following may be definitely named:-(i) Reduction in the number of ships assigned to France.(ii) Reduotion in the White Sea programme and consequentdiminution in the number of vessels taking cargo to Russia and returning in ballast.(iii) Excess transfer to United Kingdom service from&quot;permanently abroad&quot; as compared with the oxpect* ations current when our previous estimates were framed.In addition to these factors our mercantile- tonnage has been Tendered more effective by the redistribution of the liner services, leading to the great increase of shipping on the North Atlantic route.The result of those changes was that in July we imported, it is estimated, 3,600,000 tons (inclusive of goods imported directly by the Government as part cargoes and not broughtinto the Trade Accounts) against the forecast of 2,750,000 tons.
A somewhat similar difference was experienced in May;   but in the intervening month of June the imports were almost exactly in&apos; agreement with the estimate.   It would appear that the importing oopacity of our tonnage has been increased for the time being by about 20 per cent, but that the increase is uneven, a month of great excess being followed by a subsidence to previous expectation.In proceeding to revise our estimate we have made careful enquirios as to the probabilities of maintaining the present distribution of our moroantile shipping.   We understand that we nay not rely upon the maintenance of the North Atlantic service at iis present strength when winter conditions set in, and that for this reason caution must be exercised.   We must also take into consideration the possibility of having to provide much earlier than last year for such augmented services as coal for Italy and possibly France.   We must also bear in mind that the quantity of damaged tonnage awaiting repair has now reached a high figure and is constantly increasing.On the other hand we must take into account the gain which will result from the large increase in the tonnage which is expected to be completed in the United Kingdom and in the purchases from abroad in the current year.   The completions in the months July-December instead of being 509,000 tons - as arranged by the previous programme - will now,, the Navy Controller states,, be 1,090,000 tons;   while the new tonnage purchased abroad will, it is stated, be Increased from 162,000 tons, the previous figure; to 326,000 tons.   Recognising that tho Ships delivered towards the end of the year will bring no cargo in the yoar, these increases of new tonnage will still have an appr-ciable effect on the imports of the later months oft 1917.On bringing sill these elements into account we present thefollowing
following figures as the best foreoast we oan make of the probable imports for the remainder of the year.   The figures include direct Government imports carried as part cargoes.August.........       3,100,000 tonsSeptember ....... .   3,100,000     &quot;October ......... .    2,800,000     n- November ........       2,800,000     n .December ........       2,400,0&apos;Dp     wTotal 14,200,00,0     B8, The estimated total of imports in the first seven months ofthe year is 21,200,000 tons.   Adding to these the above amount for the final five months an expected total for the year of 35,400,000 tons is reached.    It may be of interoet to mention that the figure estimated by us in connection with our first forecast (19th February 1917) was 36,700,000 tons.   Our present estimates may therefore be interpreted as indicating that in the course of the year the steps taken bv the Department will be effective to within about a million tons In making good the losses of imports, both in British and foreign shipping, resulting from the intensification of the. submarine campaign.stioal Branch, . v-inistry of Shipping,    &apos; a.&quot;.w.W.P.E.    &apos;17th August,  1917.
