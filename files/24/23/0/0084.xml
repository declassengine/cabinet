OPERATIONS.From General Barter, Russia., To C.I.G.S., War Office.No,1192.16th August 1917.Following received in supplementary letter from Staff dated July 29th.    &apos; Begins:-Regrouping of enemy forces in the European theatre during period July 1st to date has assumed the ferm of considerable strengthening of his forces on Russian&apos; Roumanian front.      During this period following transfer of units have been identified:-A. From Anglo-French front to Russian front: 7 German divisions (2nd Guards, 1st Guards, 5th, 6th, 20th, lath Reserve and an Alpine detachment) and in addition 76th Reserve Division formerly erroneously considered to be on French front.     Not a single division has been sent to French front.B. From Italian te Russian front: 3 Austrian divisions Infantry (7th, 28th, 62nd) and in the opposite direction1 Austrian Infantry division (73rd)*C. From Macedonian to Russian front: 1 German Infantry Division (part of 302nd and 101st).Thus according to reliable information Russian front has been strengthened by 11 Infantry divisions ^2 Austrian and 9 German) and all other European fronts have been weakened.     Moreover unconfirmed reports from agents and prisoners tell of continued transfer of German units from Anglo-French front and Austrian units from Italian front.As pointed out in my previous&quot; letter considerable strengthening of enemy on Russian front may at present time have very serious consequences and therefore it is of the utmost importance that the Allied armies should commence energetic operations and stop this strengthening of enemy forces as soon ss  possible on Russian front.   Commander-in-Chief has therefore asked me to beg most urgently that these operations may be undertaken by British Army at once in order to meet conditions which have arisen (?now)This letter has been sent also to other representatives.
