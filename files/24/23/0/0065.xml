CORN   PRODUCT I PIT   BILL. (Note &quot;by IF. Long) .I hope the Cabinet will accept the amendment moved by Lord Lansdowne to Clause 10; part 4 of the Corn production Bill.I do not propose to discuss this matter no?/ from the point of view of the owners or occupiers of land. It is sufficient to say that there is very strong feeling throughout the country amongst many of those who are connected with the land, and who really understand their business, that this part of the Pill is neither necessary nor just;and that its passage has been unduly hurried, in the House of Lords, coming on,  as it has done at the very end of the Session when it has been impossible to give proper consideration to these very drastic proposals.   But I am convinced that unless the owners and occupiers give their cordial co-operation it will not be possible to secure   the increased cultivation which is so necessary if we are to be in a position next year to improve our food situation: and it is with this object and also on the ground that the proposed po?/ers ma;/ have a very serious effect upon local government, that 1 urge the $r$y&amp;e4tfi: of a right   of appeal in regard both to the question of good husbandry, and that of policy, namely, iiaticnal interest, which means, of course, breaking up grass land under the plough.I understand that an appeal in regard to the first of these provisions is to be allowed, but there is some doubt as to frhether the second can be accepted.   Apart from the desirability of doing all we can to remove any feeling of bitterness amongst owners and occupiers,  I desire to urge upon the Cabinet that they TTo well to hesitate before they place such drastic powers in the hands of the Local Authori-ties.I am convinced that all those who have experience of local government will agree that it:is most undesirable that powers of this kind contained-in the Bill should be exercised  by any local Authority,  and certainly not by the minor Local Authorities.   And it is to be borne in mind that these Local Committees are not confined to elected members of the Local Authorities but are composed of these and of co-opted members from outside,  and to give them these autocratic powers is to fly in the face of all that hafs^een done in connection with local government and to open the door to an amount of tyranny and favouritism which must have a most injurious effect upon the members of the Local Authorities in the country.   I have consulted some of those who have the widest experience in connection with local government,  and I have not found one who docs not agree with me.I. understand the view of the Board of Agriculture is that this power of appeal would be availed of to a large extant and their policy subsequently interfered with.   I venture to say that there is no foundation for this fear always provided that the powers are reasonably and wisely . exercised, but, on the other hand, the knowledge that this right exists and can be exercised will form a very valuable cfteck up^r- t;-s-i.vfci.cn of local Authorities who may be
inclined to make a very despotic use of their power, and, for these reasons, I beg the Cabinet,to accept the amendment.I kmow that Lord Lansdowne feels, very strongly indeed on the subject as indeed,  so far as I know, do the vast majority of people who have had real practical experience of agriculture during the last 30, years.(Intd)   Y/.K.L.18th.August, 1917.
