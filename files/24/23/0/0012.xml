Your Majesty:-The Holy Father in his anxiety to do all that he can to secure an end to the conflict which has for more than three years devastated the civilised world, has decided&apos;to submit to the Heads ot the Belligerent Peoples the concrete proposals of peace which are set forth in the document which I have the honour to annex to this letterrMay God grant that the words of His Holiness may this time produce the result so much desired for the good of all humanityrIn view of the fact that the Holy See is not in diplomatic relations with the French Government,, the Italian Government and the Government of the United States, I respectfully beg Your Majesty to cause a copy of His Holiness&apos; appeal to he forwarded to the Presi-dent of the French Republic as well as to His Majesty, The King of Italy and the President of the United StatesrI take the liberty also of enclosing twelve addi-tional copies, which I beg Your Majesty to deign to forward to the Heads of the Nations friendly to the Allies with the exception of Russia, Belgium and Brazil to whom the document has been sent directoIn expressing to Your Majesty my most sincere thanks for your extreme kindness,I am &amp;cc,(Signed)        Pierre Gardc Gasparri,
NOTE from The Pope to the Heads of the BelligerentPeoples,Prom the beginning of Our Pontificate, in the midst of the horrors of the terrible war which has been let loose upon Europe, there were three objects above all which We set before Ourselves:   to maintain a perfect impartiality in regard to all belligerents as is fitting for Him who is the common Father and Wo loves all lis children with a.like affection;   to strive always to do to all the greatest amount of good possible and that without distinction of persons and without difference of. nationality or religion, even as is enjoined upon Us by the universal law of charity as well as by the supreme spiritual charge entrusted to Us by Christ:   finally, as is demanded also by Our Mission of Peace, to omit nothing, in so far as may be in Our power, which might contribute to hasten the end of this calamity by endeavouring to induce the peoples of the world and their leaders to adopt more moderate resolutions and to enter into the calm consideration of peace - of a peace &quot;just and durable&quot;cWhoever has followed air work during these last three painful years, must surely recognize that, while remaining always faithful to Our determination of ab-solute impartiality and to Our humanitarian activities We have nonetheless continued to exhort the beiliger-&quot; ent nations and Governments to resume their brother-hood, although all that We have done to attain thisnoble
noble object has not become public knowledge.Towards the end of the first year of the war We addressed the most lively exhortations to the belliger-ent nations and We at the same time Indicated the road that they should follow in order to arrive at a:stable peace such as would be honourable for all*Unfortunately Our appeal was not regarded;   the war has continued pitilessly and with all its horrors for another two years;   it has in truth increased in cruelty and has spread over the earth, over the sea and even into the air, and desolation and death have been showered upon defenceless cities, peaceful villages and innocent populations.    No one can now imagine to what extent this universal suffering will be increased and intensified if further months or, worse still, if further years are to be added to the blood-stained period that has elapsed.    Is the civilised world then to become no more than a field of death?    and is Europe so glorious and flourishing in the past to plunge into the abyss as if driven by some universal madness and to contrive her own suicide?in this agonising situation, in the presence of this grave menace, We, Who have no private polil&amp;cal object, Who give ear to the suggestions and interests of no special one of the belligerent parties;   but $ho are inspired solely by the feeling of Our supreme duty as common Father of the Faithful by the prayers of Our children who beg for Our intervention and for Our words of peace, by the voice even of humanity andreason,
reason, We again raise a cry of peace and &quot;te renew an urgent appeal to those who&quot; hold in their hands the destinies of nations.    But, in order no longer to confine Ourselves to general terms such as circum-stances have in the past rendered desirable, We now wish to descend to proposals of a more concrete and practical nature and to invite the Governments of the belligerent countries to agree upon the following points which We feel should constitute the basis of a just and durable peace while leaving to them the task of defining and completing Our proposalsrBefore everything the fundamental point must be that the moral force of Eight should be substituted for the material force of Armsr    This would enCail a just agreement between all countries for the simultaneous and reciprocal reduction of armaments according to rules and under guarantees to be established later, to the extent necessary to, and sufficient for, the mainten-ance of public order in each country;   it would further entail in the place of armies the institution of arbi-tration with its high pacificatory functions, accord- , ing to rules and standards to be concerted between the Powers and subject to sanctions to be employed against whatever state might refuse either to submit interna-tional questions to arbitration or to accept the decisions of such arbitrationWhen once the supremacy of Right has thus been established, all obstacles to the free communications between peoples should be removed by assuring by means of rules similarly to be established the true freedom and community of the seas, an ideal which would on theone
one hand eliminate the many causes of conflict and which would on the other open to all new sources of prosperity and progress...As regards compensation for damages Caused and the costs of war, We see no other means of solving this question than by laying down as a general princi-ple a complete and reciprocal condonation, which would moreover be justified by the immense benefits which would be secured by disarmament;   all the more so as the continuation of tft&amp;s carnage for objects of an economic nature only is not comprehensible^    If there exie s in certain cases particular reasons against this solution, these reasons should be weighed with justice and equity^These pacific agreements with all the immense ad-vantages whiclilthey imply will however not be practic-able without the reciprocal restitution of the terri-tories at present occupied.    There should thus be on the part of Germany a complete evacuation of Belgium with a guarantee of absolute political, military and economic independence as regards any Power whatsoever; there should also be an evacuation of French territory; as also a similar restitution of the German colonies on the part of the other belligerent PowersrAs regards territorial questions, as for example, those under dispute between Italy and Austria and between Germany and France, there is reason to hope that in consideration of the immense advantages of a durable peace with disarmament the opposing parties would be willing to examine them in a conciliatoryspirit,
-spirit, taking into account as far as is just and possible as We said on a former occasion the aspira-   -tions of the peoples concerned, and when necessary co-ordinating particular interests with the general good of human society,.i The same spirit of equity and justice should in-spire the examination of the other territorial and political questions at issue and notably those which concern Armenia, the Balkan States and the territories forming the ancient Kingdom of Poland, whose noble, historical traditions and the suffering endured especially during the present war should make a special appeal to the sympathy of the nationsrSuch are the principal bases on which We believe that the future re-organisation of States should rest. They are of a nature to render impossible the return of similar conflicts and to prepare the solution of the economic question which is so^lmportant for the future and the material prosperity of all the belligerent Statese     In laying them before you who at this tragic moment direct the destinies of nations,We are in-spired by the pleasant hope of having them accepted and of seeing thus this terrible struggle which appears more and more to be  in useless massacre concluded in the nearest futurer    On the other hand the whole world recognises that on the one side as on the other military honour has been preserved.    Listen there-fore to Our prayer, accept Oxv fatherly invitation which We address to you in the name of the Divine Redeemer, the Prince of Peace,    Reflect upon yourvery
very grave responsibility before God and man;   on your decisions depend the tranquillity and happiness of numberless families, the lives of thousands of young men, in one word the felicity of those peoples, whose well-being it is your duty to securer    May God in-spire you with decisions in harmony with His Holy Will; may Heaven grant that in winning the applause of your contemporaries you may also assure for yourselves among future generations the fair name of PeacemakersrAs regards Ourselves, in close unison in,prayer and penitence with all the faithful souls who sigh for peace, We implore for you the gift of the Holy Spirit to grant you light and judgment.(Signed)        Benedictus XV rVatican,AUgUSt  IStr    1917r
