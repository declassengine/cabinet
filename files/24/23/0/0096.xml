12SB C B I T .From:-    Caucasus Military Agent,To:Repeated General Barter.D.M.I. .12th August, 1917.7 p.ni.T.L. 242. : Operations. Following from Brigadier-General Shore.Today Colonel Marsh and I -visited General Averianov the Director-General of Supply, Caucasus front and late Chief of Russian General Staff.2.     He said that on the part of part of the 2nd Caucasus Army Corps in Persia action which is required hy British (T.L. 157 July 1st) is not feasible without 3 essentials, viz. money, transport, moral. .3.     As regards money 18,000,000 Persian Zrity (in silver) required immediately and 15,000,000 monthly, for local supplies lor lines of communication and for one third part of payment of troops.   Can British supply this or force Russian Government to do so?   Without this no Russian offensive against Mosul can he genuine or sustained.4.     As regards transport probably requirements of 1st Cavalry Corps can be met, but those of 7th Corps certainly not from Russia, probably not even locally. (This point will shortly be ascertained by personal enquiry on the spot).5.     As regards moral.   Discipline is bad in both Corps (T.L. 191 July 18th). (This point one for personal enquiry also).6.     Finally, as a soldier, General Averianov emphatically stated his opinion that British must not expect any serious co-operation from Russian army in this or any other theatre until discipline is restored, that there are no signs of this, nor any grounds for prophesy as to when it may be hoped for.7.     Above has been read over to the Chief of Staff of Caucasus front General Tomilof who concurs in these views and strongly deprecates offensive against Mosul without preparation, adequate means for which are lacking. With regard to paragraph 4, he knows the country well and is certain that it is impossible to get required transport. (All remarks within brackets are commentary).8.     I leave on August 14th for Urmia.&quot;U.Ii.l.
