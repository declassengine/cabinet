ORE Tr-11 &quot; 1 1 * 1&quot; &apos;   &quot;lV 1710.1*r  ^TH^o       4 4WAR CaBIEET.THE CUSTODY Off WAR CABINET DOCUMENTS.Hotc by the secretary.iin important question of principle as to the ultimate custody of War Cabinet documents issued to Ministers is rais:d by the resignation of Mr. Henderson and Mr, Austen Chamberlain.2,    I am informed that the immemorial custom has been for Cabinet docu-imcnts to remain tho personal property of Cabinet Ministers on their vacating office.   I foci it my duty, however, to draw the attention of tho War Cabin t to the fact that there are many differences between the peace conditions in whioh this practice grew up and those under which -the present V/ar Cabinet works.3,    In the first place it must be remombcred that before the War nearly all papers dealing with ngebional defence, foreign policy, and kindred subjects, were issued by the Committee of Imperial Defence.   By a docis-ion of that Committee taken on Hay 14, 1908 (Minutes of the 99th Llect-ing) (Appondix) all Papers issued wore subsequently to be returned to tho Secretary, the only exception being in the case of a vory limited number of Permanent&apos;Officials in the. Admiralty, *Jar Office., treasury, Foreign Office, Colonial Office, and India Office   By the same decision icrs of the Committee were allowod access to CI.D. Papers prepared during their term of Membership.   Considerable use has been raado of this latter provision.   Now, however, the War Cabinet has absorbed the Committee of Imperial Defence, so that a very large category of highly secret papers is issued to Members., documents corresponding to which in times of peace would, by the rules of the Committee, have boon returned Oiho Secretary.   Before the War a small organization was maintained in he Committee of Imperial Defence for; ensuring the recovery of documents,ad in thc vast majority of. cases they wore., in fact., recovered..- -    The
4.     The second now factor is that, probably for the first time in tho history of the country, certainly for many decades. Cabinet Minutes arc-kept.   This introduces a no?/ class of document in which many very secret matters arc dealt with.5.     Thirdly, the number of documents issued to the War Cabinet is very much larger than it was before the War,   For example, I calculate on .a rough estimate that Mir. Arthur Henderson must have not much less than . 2,000 doouments.   It must be remembered also that the tfar Cabinet has always made a very great point of receiving the very fullest information from all Departments.   Anyone who has been through the War from its commencement up to the present time knows that thero is no comparison botv?cen the amount of secret information placed at the disposal of the War Cabinet now, and, before the present Government assumed Office.   This in itself is a. strong argument for the adoption of special measures to ensure secrecy.    If tho Admiralty, v/ar Office, and Foreign Office believe there is a danger of their secrets leaking out they will be so much the more reluctant to give frank and full information.6,    Finally, the importance of socrecy in time of war is greater than, in time of peace.    In the aggregate, the War Cabinet documents contain.very oomplete information on nearly every aspect of our war policy and aims,7*     I am particularly anxious not to suggest for one moment that anyCabinet minister,, past or present, would be so. indiscreet as deliberatelyor unintentionally to allow national secrets to leak out, or to permitunauthorised person; to have access to secret documents.   Every CabinetMinister is bound by his Privy Councillors oath to :-&quot;keep secret all matters committed and v revealed unto me or that shall be treat-ed of secretly in Council&quot;, his is not tho danger to bo apprehended..   Thero.are,.however, otherrisks
:8.    There is, therefore, I submit, a strong case for re consideration ox the vhole cucstion.   Elaborate precautions&quot;are taken in this and other bfficoa to prevent leakage.   To. allow&apos;national secrets to pass beyond tho control of the Government is seriously to impair tho valuo &apos;of- these pre-cautions.9.    From the point of view of the Secretariat oi the v?.,r Cabinet, thoDaly really satisfactory decision would be to&apos; apply to the War Cabinettho rules of tho Committee of Imperial Defence Uppcndix)-, that is toDay, to insist on the return of all Cabinet documents, subject to the.fight of ex-Ministers to have aooeos to those prepared during theirrm of membership.   The ainutes of tho late        Committee had printedm them the following notice ;&quot;To be returned to The secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence, 2 Whitehall Gardens, oIn the first month of the i-ar Cabinet1s existence the same notice was tainted on War Cabinet Ilinutes.    The difficulties of obtaining recovery, lov;ovor, proved&quot; insuperable, both iii the case of the ear Committee aidfro f/ar Cabinet, and the notice, which had no Government sanction beyondtncrisks,   When an ex-Cabinet Jinistcr dies hie secret papers become the property: of his executors.   These are bound by no Privy Councillor1 s oath, and are not necessarily persons of the same discretion as the Cabinet Minister himself.   It is easy to imagine a good many cases in wbich information in Cabinet documents might leak out, whether by -ocidont or design, without any technical infringement of tho Official Secrets tlot.   For example, there might be a case of an ox-Cabinet linistor having a wife of foreign extraction who would become his oxocutrix and might elect to reside in the country of her birth, in vhich case the documents would pass with her beyond the control of the ovornmcnt.

 the decision of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which was not strictly applicable, was abandoned.

10. If the War Cabinet cannot see their way to approving this drastic solution, I would at least ask for authority to take the following action in the case of all War Cabinet Ministers going out of office:-

(i) To ask them to return certain specified documents of great secrecy. In this category would be included:- Minutes of the War Cabinet; documents of the War Policy Committee; documents dealing with Naval, Military, and Foreign Policy; Terms of Peace; any documents containing unparaphrased cypher telegrams, and others which I am not in a position to specify until I have carefully scrutinised  and the list of documents furnished to Mr. Henderson and Mr. Auston Chamberlain. In asking for the return of these documents it is proposed, subject to the approval of the War Cabinet, to state that the outgoing Cabinet Minister can have access to any document issued to him during his term of office:

(ii) To ask that the outgoing Cabinet Minister should make such testamentary depositions as would provide for the immediate return of the documents to the Secretary on his demisc.

11. It is necessary to draw a distinction between a Member of the War Cabinet, such as Mr. Henderson, and a member of the Govenment outside the War Cabinet, such as Mr. Austen Chamberlain. I understand that Mr. Chamberlain considers that the War Cabinet Minutes and other documents are his personal property, although he has lent them temporarily to his successor. I would submit that the intention of the War Cabinet in their decision of December 12, last, to issue copies of the War Cabinet Minutes and other documents to certain Ministers was to send them for the ? of the Office and not for the individual. The War Cabinet Minute on the subject designates the persons to whom Minutes are sent by their official titles and not by name.

12. Every case, however, will be provided for if the War Cabinet can see their way to adopt the rules of the Committee of Imperial Defence which ? attached in the appendix. I would most strongly urge, as the result of years&apos; experience under very varying conditions, that this course should

be  
be adopted.   Failing this, I would ask   -(a) for authority to take the action referred to in paragraph 10 in the case of outgoing members of the War Cabinet,   and(b) for a decision that War Cabinet,documents supplied to members of the Government, r/ho are not members of the &quot;Jar Cabinet, should bo regarded as the property of the Office and not of the individual.(Intd.)
