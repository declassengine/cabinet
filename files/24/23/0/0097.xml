C.I.G.S.OPERATIONS.SECRET.13.8.1917. 5.45. p.ra39467 cipher.     Following for General Foch.&quot;I am informed by General Milne that he has requested General Sarrail to relieve his left division in order to enable him to withdraw.one division, as agreed at the recent Conference, and that General Sarrail states that he is unable to do so.   British front is now held by five divisions and one brigade, and for remainder of Allied front there are 18 divisions of varying strength.   Opposite the British front are 93 hostile battalions, while opposite remainder of. Allied front there are 140 hostile battalions.   The rifle strength of the British is at present 54,600 and when the division goes to Palestine, will be only about 43,000.   The remaining Allies have 149,000 rifles, that is to say,more than three times the rifles the British will have, while the hostile battalions opposed to them are much less than double those opposed to the British.   At the end of November, at General Joffrefs request, I agreed to British relieving 35th Italian Division and 34th French Colonial Brigade, in order that Sar-rail might concentrate troops for the offensive.   As no offensive is now in question Sarrail must have troops available to carry out the required relief.   The front held by the British includes two out of the three main lines of approach, and General Milne reports that four British div-is ions are not sufficient to hold this front.   I am entirely in agreement with him,   2i French divisions, one Servian and one Greek are, I understand, now in reserve.   I request that you will kindly send the necessary instructions to General Sarrail to relieve the left British division, in order that the division may be sent as early as possible to Palestine.&quot;
