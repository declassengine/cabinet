Rec. 16.8.17. 12 midnight.

Following for PHILLIPS, 10 Downing Street, for the PREMIER and Cabinet from NORTHCLIFFE:-

I have Jast returned from long series ef interviews with Colonel HOUSE at whose suggestion I retrained at Magnolia Friday to Tuesday. He has constant stream of visitors from Washington end telephone rings continuously so that consecutive conversation is difficult. Altogether my memorandum interviews lasted eight hours.

I asked Colonel HOUSE if he would tell me what was attitude of the Government towards the four hundred million dollar loan and Russion contracts. He avoided Russian question.

Regarding four hundred million dollar loan he said McADOO came to see him last Wednesday and discussed it at great length. Matter ought to be cleared out of the way as soon as possible for the sake of McADOO&apos;s position with Congress. McADO was willing, he added, to (?)advance upon your issue ninety days Treasury Bill. HOUSE thought we ought to sell some of our collateral to which I strongly demurred. He repeated paramount objections to MORGAN.  HOUSE said whole winter will he spent in Congress wrangling financially, and for this reason McADOO must be in position to make perfectly clear to Congress that the money of the people of the United States was not being used for the benefit of MORGAN who typified Wall Street and the money power to which the Democracy so strongly objected. It is obvious to me from the Press and from conversations everywhere that the almighty dollar will be more talked about during the rest of the war then ever, house reiterated his suggestion that some liberal politician of high place should be here. I referred to the Ambassador&apos;s expressed racial objections to but HOUSE dismissed these objections of being of no importance. Essential thing was to have
a liberal of distinction regarding inter-Ally Council; he said he had impressed upon McADOO that in the allocation of credits utmost support should be given to Great Britain. He had pointed out to McADOO the possibility of England and America being left alone to fight enemy.  H0USE&apos;s reports from France were not hopeful. He was anxious about CAILLAUX&apos;s movement and asked me what I thought France would do if Germany gives autonomy to Alsace Lorraine.

HOUSE quite appreciates force of our objections to the proposed powers of Inter-Ally conference, but he urged that endorsement of this kind was essential for McADOO&apos;s political position. McADOO has many enemies and is about to go to Congress for permission to issue another immense loan. He must be fortified by expert military opinion from Europe that these vast loans are neccessary to victory. I argued matter at considerable length. Eventually HOUSE, who really raised his voice said with much emphasis "McADOO will insist on the "Inter-Ally Council", The war, he continued, was not popular although things were going smoothly and there were ramarkebly few strikes or conscription riots; but there was ugly spirit in Congress and McADOO must be able to prove that no money is being wrongfully used. Question of French and Russian influence here is directly bound up with finance. In view of popular under-estimation of Great Britain&apos;s efforts, says House, it was most difficult to explain immense appropriations, for Great Britain.

TARDIEU and BAKHMETIEFF are naturally working for themselves using to the fell the historical sympathy for the French Republic and keeping America&apos;s Interest in the new Russian Republic. They visit House about one a month. We are crowded out by France. We have no British Military representative who has seen anything of the war. American soldiers in France write home only about French Army: nothing is heard of our
* a -float. Itage says; * en ought to send to ^htngtoa British *!offloors of high distinction aisd war experience.     &apos;-&apos;e do neta military mission Mt it v?ould &quot;be advantageous to us &quot;if you would ssad such Officers end if they were efterwtr&amp;s &quot;reinforced by Offleers in various branches ef the service with &quot;technical experience rained recently in the field.,?    Mil this hm direct bearing; *on money situation end on U&amp;UlQGUi position before 0ongrese*-  C$rivets).   I have to mention that 2Go/JD00 Is known to look forward to every reversion of the Presidency and must stand well with Congress,
-  - lit YOKE.August 16, 1917. Eec. 16-8*17. 11.5. p.m*fallowing is in continuation of      taX&amp;grsua 10. 11 of the XSthJ-Ao to Shipping, aoaiCSS of MJSTItALXA, has sent very warmly worded protest which 1 gave to iiOiiBK.     MMim says kin 14 sM pi&apos; building here are the property of the mmm^^hTB, and that to take them will he regarded m unfriendly.     I fear ships will he confiscated.     At later interview 1 returned to this subject of the confiscation of the ships which we are mm building here.   I told hire what we had dene with reference to neutral tfhipe in a similar position in JSngland, and gave hi&amp;(?) abstract of xaetoerandum on the whale, position dram up by KGYMH. and theJPKSSIM1T like to have iseatoranda on all subjects (to) discuss with them.1 find 8011826 well aoqu&amp;inted with details of the submarine memorandum of August 4th submitted to the FESSISMf and also with details of submarine loesses off FilMCJI Goaet of which X was unaware.   He observed that the situation is one of profound anxiety for the tf  BZ$AS people in view of transport cf their soldiers and supplies.   Everything possible, he said, is being dons to epfed up ship construction.     fiis reports from all parts BHITiSD 8?AfSS indicate that HPI, the new shipping mm, is already infusing great activity into building.Ha showed me plan of new methods for making chips untinkable and      knots s all about CmQWhAm one ofinterned a KMAH Ships which has been fitted with the non-sinkins box, as he called them, is to be torpedoed ne*t week to ascertain whether plan is effective.   If it is, reduced iuauraaee rates are te be granted to all ships so fitted.   But
inasmuch as it will take many months te equip American mercantile marine with til! non-sinking device, anxiety will   , not greatly lessen for some time.   HOUSE regretted  no concerted action had   been taken by the BBXfSSH and Aii&amp;hlOM Ctevernments with reference te submarine m&amp; ether Questions to which 1 will refer later en*As to RUSSIA, pointed out that the Allieshod been altogether outwitted in propaganda there and everywhere else.    If a email portion of money which has been expended en war materials had been put into effective propaganda in Kuseia, neutral countries, and in SOUTH AM&amp;KICA, v?hers m allowed the (tomans to spread their lies unchecked, the i?ar would have nearly reached conclusion.   In our inter-view August 14th. t he had also laid great emphasis en tlile matter.He told me of plans tvhereby leading $ermsn-Americansare te proceed te neutral countries adjoining Germany andintroduce into Germany by all means possible news of thegigantic war preparations of the United states all ef whichnews, he said, is being belittled in in Germany.   Specially willthey emphasise great air preparations which are te ay kno**ledge being made here.     H0UB1 passed through KARLSRUHEimmediately after our ^ir attack on that town.     The raid, hepointed out, created consternation net only in KARL0BUHE  ^ut outthrough/AMY, indicating difference between Germane and English psychology.   Germane were, he said, evidently under the impression their raids on our towns produced on our people the same effect as our raids did on theirs.   (Message incomplete mom follows).
August 15th, 1017. Bee. 17-b-17 7.25, a.m.In continuation of aiy telegram Ho. 13. of the 15th1 do not know how far HQUtUi speaks for the President on this matter of propaganda, but in the course   of our interviews he referred to it again and again.   He said the war was being fought without imagination; that *?here the Germans have spent millions on propaganda we have spent only thousands, and that ours mm   poor matter at that.     Be repeated that it is essential to spread in Serraany though neutral newspapers, by aeroplane, and by the numerous Serman visitors to be found in Switzerland, Denmark, Holland, Sweden and Hor*ay* neisfa of the immense expenditure and preparation being made by United States.lie regretted, but not unpleasantly, that all our conversations with this Government are about money, and suggested that the number of our financial intermediaries sras legion, referring no doubt te the fact that President, McADGG and CB0SB1K are interviewed about money by Ambassador, Bir Richard Crawford, Lever, Gordon and jssy&amp;elf.We discussed great many other ear topics, recently exchanged memorandum having made him thoroughly acquainted *ith our efforts.     He was not impressed by TAKDIiSU1 &amp; manifesto which 0mV$m  mtum cabled for further instructions and vhUuk he knew was intended for Congress.     He assured jae that the President was absolutely aware of the great part we had played in the ^ar.X mentioned possibility of visit by the Premier.   He said he believed thin will be very necessary, but should be reserved for emergencies, and again asked if General could net come and speak in the Weet.
American people, he said, suffer from the fact that they hove had no centa -t with the great personalities of war except BALffOUR and COFFEE.     I am sure appreciateshow anxious they are to see people of distinction and bow nsuch good can he accomplished in this way.H0BS1 is busily discussing with the Poles here formation of Polish Army to be sent to France.I found him as before quite up to date ns regards KngU si: political noveraents and personalities.     lie was not pleased about imKD1?HSOU-HACPO?TALD incident!     other matters discussed were the Irish Convention, difficulty caused by Congressional sympathy with France and Congressional ignorance of our efforts, various causes antagonism to England, arrival HIH Pfv^TfUCK BLACK and Mr. OOHIK of whose mission he had been informed,evidently from London, German casualties- which he has reason to believe are greater than Germans admit, plan American air fleet, remarkable ability STHTTI1XUS of MORGANS, and horror caused in the United States by the German submarine treatment crews of the Belgian &quot;Prince.wHe asked me if X would remain over until Wednesday for further consuittion, but I informed him that I could stay Tuesday only as 1 had to preside at the British Army Film display in Hew York, work which is now being admirably organised by   BUTXsKR,     I regret disjointed despatch but I am very short of assistants owing to illness of staff caused by continued heat.
