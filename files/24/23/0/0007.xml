CIRCULATED TO THE CABINET.&quot;Foreign Commercial Intelligence,Joint Memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIt is clear that after the War the demands upon the Government for the collection and diffusion of commercial intelligence for the benefit of British Trade are likely to be very much greater than in the past.   Both the Board of Trade and the Foreign-Off ice have for some time past been maturing plans for developing and improving the official arrangements, for commercial intelligence so far as they fall within their scope.   The Board of Trade have obtained the sanction of the Treasury for a large development of their Department of Commercial Intelligence and for a wide expansion of the system of Trade Commission^ ers within the Empire, which was originally established by the present Prime Minister when President of the Board of Trade.   On the other hand, the Foreign Office has carefully examined by means of a Departmental Conn mittee the best means of increasing the utility of the Commercial Attache1&apos; and Consular Service to British trade, and lias drawn up a scheme for the purpose?Some difficulties, however, arose in defining and adjusting the limits of responsibility of the Foreign Office and Board of Trade with respect to the collection and distribution&apos;of commercial intelligence obtained through the medium of the Commercial Attaches and Consuls in foreign countries,.   Eventually Viscount Grey and Mre Hunciman agreed last Autumn on a compromise for dealingand Lord Robert Cecilywith
with, the sub-^ectv--which is appended to this memorandum (See Annex ItpJJ3   Subsequently, at the request of the Foreign Office it was decided to appoint a -Com-mittee, under the Chairmanship of Lord Partiigdon, with power to review the whole question.   This Com-mittee, however, failed to come to an unanimous agree-ment, and presented two reports which are annexed to this memorandum (see Annex 1).,The War Cabinet will observe that there were in effect two main questions, submitted to the Paringdon Committee.   The first was whether the Foreign Office or the Board of Trade should control the commercial intelligence service abroad, which is supplied bp the Commercial Attaches.   Upon the first point all the members of the Committee were in substantial agreement that the control of Commercial Attaches should be left to the Foreign Office, acting in close consultation with the Board of Trade as regards in-structions and appointments, and that both this ser-vice and the Consular Service should be enlarged and improved.   A Committee on which the Board of Trade are represented has been appointed by the Foreign Office to consider what changes in the present system are necessary to carry out the views of the Committee. This Committee has had several meetings and has made considerable progressc   If the Treasury approve of the arrangements recommended, a second Committee will immediately proceed to select the personnel necessaryeThe eeccrd question was whether the work of collating and distributing commercial intelligence from foreign countries among the commercial community in this country should continue to be performed by theDepartment
Department or t)ozine^ the Boardof Trade or should he dealt with by a Department to be created at the Foreign Office.   Upon the second point the Committee were not in agreement. The Cteirman and the representative of the Board of Trade decided in favour of the former course,    Tho majority of the Committee favoured the work being done by the Foreign Office*Subsequent discussions have taken place With a view of arriving at an agreement between the Depart-ments, with the assistance of Lir, Montagu (then Vice^ Chairman of the Heconstruction Committee)cThe following scheme has now been agreed upon by the President of the Board of Trade and by hort Robert Cecil representing the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and is submitted for the approval of the War Cabinet,,It is proposed that a new and enlarged-Commer-cial Intelligence Department shall be created on a scale adequate to meet the reasonable requirements of British trade after, the War. &apos; Parliamentary con-trol over the Department. will be exercised through a new Parliamentary Secretary, wjio will occupy the position both of Additional Parliamentary Secretary at the Board of Trade and also of Additional Par* liamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Tfls Parliamentary&apos; Secretary will be responsible to the President of the Board of Trade for all matters within the competence of that Department, and res-piisible to the Secretary of State for  foreign Affairs for all matters concerning the Foreign Office0An
An agreement has T)eearfarrived-s$ as to the matters which under this arrangement will be referable to the Foreign Secretary (See Annex II).   On all other matters the responsibility will lie with the Board of TradeaThe Commercial Intelligence Department will eventually comprise the existing Department of Com--mercial Intelligence of the Board of Trade, and the Foreign Trade Department of the Foreign Office; and will take over such of the staff and records of the War Trade Intelligence and Statistical Departments aS may be available and required,The official head of the Department will be an officer appointed jointly by the President of the Board of Trade and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.   The appointment and control of the Trade Commissioners will as at present rest with the Board of Trade and the appointment and control of the Commercial Attaches and Consular Service with the Foreign Officej but the work of the new Department will comprise all matters dealing with commercial in-telligence, and so far as is necessary for that pur* pose, it will give directions-to the oversea services and make the necessary arrangements for keeping them in close touch with the commercial classed in this country.   All official instructions given by the De-par tment to Commercial Attaches or Consuls will be issued in the name of the Foreign SecretarycIt is proposed that there should be a constant interchange of staff between the Department and both the Foreign Of::i:G and the Board of Trade,, so that members of those&apos; Departments may be thoroughlyacquainted
acquainted with the work.   Opportunity should he given to diplomats and consuls in training to serve for a period in the Department.   It should also draw personnel from the Consular and. Commercial Attache Services and from men of outside, business experience.It is submitted that these proposals go far towards solving a problem which for some years past has been urged on the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government by the Commercial and industrial community^ Their criticisms have been especially directed against the duality of the existing systems under  -which, while the direction of the Commercial Attache, and Consular Services rests with the Foreign Office, the utilisation of the fruits of their commercial work lies with the Board of Trade.   Under the new scheme the direction of the commercial work of the foreign services and the distribution of the intel-ligence collected by them will be dealt with by a single Department, and as the same Department will also direct the Trade Commissioner service within the Empire, uniformity of policy will be secured in respect of overseas trade as a whole9The constitution of the proposed Department presents no. doubt an unust&amp;l feature in that the C      new Parliamentary Secretary will be responsible to the President of the Board of Trade -for one group of questions and to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for another, ,Some such duality,-however, is essential if overlapping and duplication sm to beavoided,

Report by Mr. P. Dudley Docker, C.B., Mr. de P. Pennefather, M.P.,and Mr. Victor Wellesley.To the Eight Honourable the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Right Honourable the President of the Board of Trade.Gentlemen,1. Our &quot; terms of reference &quot; require us in the first place to consider &quot; the best form of organisation for promoting our foreign trade through representatives abroad, including the consular service.&quot; In our opinion, any efficient organisation abroad for the promotion of trade must necessarily be based on an efficient consular service. The reports which have recently been published on this service include the Report of the Royal Commission of 1912-14 (compiled before the war), the two Reports of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, dated December 1916 and January 1917, and the Report of the Federation of British Industries, issued last December. As they contain many- of the reasons which have convinced us that the consular service requires considerable extension and reform we do not consider it necessary to burden this report with much recapitulation, or with detailed suggestions as to the manner in which reforms and reorganisation should be carried out. We believe that the details of effective administrative reform can only be instituted and carried through by those immediately responsible for the service, after careful and thorough investigation of new circumstances resulting from the war as affecting the different countries in which the consular service performs its duties.2. We desire to state, however, that we consider that most of the recommendations contained in the report of the Departmental Committee of the Foreign Office (which is attached as an appendix to this report) appear to us to be based upon correct principles, although details may require amendment and some more careful definitions may be desirable. We desire to emphasise most strongly our opinion that the consideration of these proposals with a view to their adoption should be undertaken without delay by a small Foreign Office Committee upon which the Board of Trade should be represented, and that reforms approved by this committee should be carried into effect promptly under its supervision. We feel it necessary to add that the reforms should in any case include a considerable addition to&apos; the number of existing consular posts, together with their careful redistribution in accordance with commercial advice, a large increase in the number of salaried officers, a reduction in the number of unpaid (i.e., trading) officers, and the elimination to the greatest possible extent of consular officers in any capacity who are not of British birth and descent. We also recommend to the attention of the committee, which we have suggested above, the desirability of revising the scale of pay, and especially the scale of office and other local allowances at present allotted to the consular service, together with the question of more rapid promotion, retirement of those who are no longer efficient, the provision of better consular premises, and an increase in the clerical staff at many consulates.3. At the same time we desire to record our opinion that the consular service at present contains many officers of great zeal and ability, and that the shortcomings of this service in the past may have been largely due, in many cases, to the employment of unsuitable honorary officers, to lack of staff&apos;, to failure to provide the facilities and funds required to enable consuls to perform their duties efficiently, and to lack of proper direction from this country rather than to the faults of the officials themselves.4. Assuming an improved consular service to have been organised, we consider it should be supplemented by the creation of a new class of officers consisting of men (in sufficient numbers) who would be neither consuls nor trade commissioners, nor commercial attaches (as those terms are at present generally understood), but who should, in fact, be &quot; commercial intelligence officers,&quot; although preferably called ^commercial counsellors.&quot; These commercial counsellors should receive diplomatic rank (as the present commercial attaches do), and connect up the consulates (with which they should work closely) the commercial side of the embassies to which they are attached, and the commercial side of the Foreign Office in London.5. While the heads of missions abroad would naturally turn to these commercial counsellors for information and advice, precautions should be taken to prevent commercial counsellors from becoming absorbed in the ordinary * routine work of the embassy. One of these precautions Should be the provision of staffs for the commercial counsellors, each of whom should have at least one competent permanent assistant, capable of taking his place and doing his work during his absence, and, wherever
possible, of separate offices. In addition to this, junior members of the embassy should be obliged to give definite assistance for a definite period in the office of the commercial counsellor as a necessary step towards promotion.6 We think that the main functions of a commercial counsellor should be to watch over British financial, commercial, and industrial interests in the country or area of a country in which he is stationed, and to collect and transmit promptly to the Foreign Office all information likely to be serviceable to such interests. He should travel in his district, in order to visit and confer with the consular officials therein (who in any case should, on their own initiative, report regularly to him on commercial matters in addition to replying to his enquiries) and to increase his knowledge generally. He -should co-operate and consult with any bodies or persons approved by the head of his; mission (for example, the local branches or agents of the proposed British trade banks), and be able to obtain freely the assistance of &quot; experts &quot; in regard to matters which require special or technical knowledge. We do not think that com-mercial counsellors should be &apos;&quot; glorified commercial travellers,&quot; pushing the interests of particular persons or groups of traders, but rather that they should investigate conditions, analyse their causes, observe recent changes and indications of impending changes, study the nature, extent, and fluctuations of competitive trades, M&apos;atch for openings for British trade, and report and advise upon all these matters in the national interest. They should, from time to time, return to this country in order to report to the Foreign Office, and to be brought by it into touch with the commercial community through the Chambers of Commerce or otherwise.7. It is obvious that anyone possessing the knowledge, tact, initiative, and character essential to the proper discharge of the duties of a commercial counsellor, must be entitled to good position and rumuneration, and it is to be hoped that the prospect of promotion to these well-paid and honourable posts of commercial counsellors and assistant commercial counsellors will add to the inducements of the consular service as a career, and stimulate the interest of consuls in the commercial side of their work. With this object in view, we suggest as a general rule that in making these appointments preference should be given to consular officers (irrespective of seniority) who have proved themselves to possess special aptitude in regard to commercial matters, and who are generally suitable for the posts. At the same time, if men more suitable can be found outside the consular service, such men should not be debarred from being selected as commercial counsellors or their assistants. There are no doubt men of commercial experience who after a short preparation would be more suitable for such posts than others who have only had diplomatic, consular, or departmental experience. So much will depend upon the selection of the right men for these posts particularly at first that we think they should be appointed by the Secretary of State, after consultation with a selection committee consisting of representatives of the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade, and the commercial community, and later, if the service developed into an Imperial service, including representatives of the Dominions, India, and the Crown colonies. We also recommend that a representative of the commercial community should be represented on the Board of Selection for candidates for the consular service.8. Assuming that this new class of commercial counsellors has been created, the question arises under whose control and direction should the commercial counsellors and their assistants be placed ?   There are apparently three alternatives : (1.) More or less dual control or direction divided between the Foreign Office andthe Board of Trade. (2.) Sole control and direction by the Board of Trade. (3.) Sole control and direction by the Foreign Office.After verv careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that the adoption of No. 1 in any form would merely mean a compromise between the two Departments, leaving untouched the great and obvious objections to placing our agents in foreign countries only partly under the direction of the Department which is responsible for their actions, and partly, perhaps mainly, under the direction of another Department which\has no such responsibility, and which cannot either reward them for good serviceXor mmish them for inefficiency ; we therefore decide against alternative No. 1.If it Xere practicable to hand over the sole control and direction of our consuls and commercial counsellors to the Board of Trade, much might be said from some points of view in favour of that course, but, as it is admittedly not practicable, we are obliged also to reject alternative No. 2.
This elimination forces us to the adoption of No. 3. Apart from this, we consider that, as the commercial counsellors form an essential link between the consular and the diplomatic services, and as both of these services are (and admittedly must remain) under the Foreigh Office, it is clear that the proper Department to control and direct the commercial counsellors and their assistants must also be the Foreign Office.9. We are strengthened in this view by the fact that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is the only Minister who can be held responsible in Parliament for the actions or errors of our representatives or agents in foreign countries, and for any con-sequences arising therefrom. It would be impossible for the Foreign Office to exercise proper control, or for the Secretary of State to be held fully responsible to the country through Parliament, if the commercial counsellors were to receive instructions from, or be interfered with by, any other body. Divided direction or control wGuld also infringe the elementary rules of sound organisation, and ultimately lead to inter-departmental friction,, duplication of work, delay, loss of efficiency, and needless expenditure.Moreover, we do not see any necessity for such division of control or direction, since it should be the obvious duty of the Foreign Office not merely to obtain and supply the Board of Trade with all the foreign commercial information required by it, but also to direct the attention of the Board of Trade to all foreign matters of com-mercial importance, even although the Board of Trade had not enquired about them, just as it should be the duty of the Board of Trade to draw the attention of the Foreign Office to all matters arising in this country which ought to be known to it or communicated to our representatives abroad. All statistics compiled by either Department should of course be promptly supplied to the other.10. The question remains : How is the information collected by the commercial counsellors abroad to be distributed at home and by whom ? Under the present system, most of such work is done by the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade. We think that in future all this work should be done by a Trade Intelligence Department at the Foreign Office, and that for this purpose the principle should be accepted of transferring to this Department as much of the existing staff of the Com-mercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade as may be practicable, thus introducing into the Foreign Office elements of business knowledge and details with which it is very desirable that it should be brought into the closest possible contact in order that our foreign commercial interests should be intelligently dealt with.11. We attach the greatest importance to the commercial counsellors and the Department responsible for them being thus brought in close and constant touch with industrial, commercial, and financial interests at home, in order chat they may acquire full knowledge and feel the full and direct force of the views of these interests, instead of obtaining them (possibly in a devitalised form) at second hand.Iu this connection we quote the following passage from the just-issued Final Report of the Dominions Royal Commission (Cd. 8462, paragraph 638, p. 142): &quot; It appears to us that any organisation for the purpose of fostering the trade or commerce of a country cannot, and should not, deal solely with economic oppor-tunities abroad. Enquiries in oversea markets can only be properly directed and the results adequately utilised in the light of a full knowledge of industrial require-ments and industrial capabilities at home. The ideal Commercial Intelligence Department of any Government must therefore depend for efficient working as much on a staff of experts conversant with home industries as upon well-trained commercial representatives abroad. We fear that, in the organisation of commer-cial services in the past, this consideration has sometimes been overlooked ; but we emphasise it, as it is obvious that after the war there will be a keen competition amongst manufacturing countries to secure overseas trade for their industries.&quot;We concur so&apos;completely with the above that we urge that in future the Depart-ment which has control of our consuls and commercial counsellors [i.e., of our foreign commercial intelligence agents), and which (for reasons already given) should direct them, ought also to be made fully conversant with the requirements and capabilities of j our manufacturers through constant and direct touch with them. We see no reason why any desired number of &quot; experts &quot; should not be added to the existing Commercial Department at the Foreign Office, as this commercial intelligence staff need not be recruited on the same lines as the purely diplomatic staff, but can be created ad hoc as required. IThe fact that various Government Departments, including the Board of Trade, have successfully brought in from outside heads and staff without any previous
departmental training, proves that it is quite possible at short notice to introduce m business experience and acumen into a Government Department.12. We think that other advantages in having the proposed new Commercial Intelligence Department at the Foreign Office would be that the information collected abroad could be issued from that Department with the least possible delay and with the greatest discretion, and that from such a Department enquiries and suggestions emanating from traders at home could be sent abroad with the greatest despatch.13. Our suggestions are not intended to cast any slur upon, or in any way to affect prejudicially the status of, any member of the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade as at present constituted, or of any member of the existing Foreign Trade Department of the Foreign Office, which has, we believe, done much valuable commercial work since its institution in January 1916. We do not suggest any change in regard to the present connection between the Board of Trade (or other Departments) and our consuls abroad in regard to shipping and other matters which do not affect and are not affected by our foreign commercial policy.14. Nor do we suggest any transfer of that part of the Board of Trade Commercial Intelligence Branch which relates to trade with our Dominions, Crown colonies, or India. Our reference being limited to &quot;foreign&quot; countries, we do not feel justified in making suggestions in regard to such points which obviously would require separate consideration by the Colonial and India Offices or representatives of the Dominions and Crown Colonies, and which might open up larger questions, such as that of a Ministry of Commerce, which, of course, is a matter quite apart from our present enquiry.15. We realise that our proposals involve for the present, at all events the maintenance of two Trade Intelligence Departments, one under the Foreign Office in connection with foreign countries, and another under the Board of Trade in connection with the Dominions and Crown Colonies. While this might in some respects be inconvenient, we consider that any such inconvenience would be mainly a matter of detail capable of adjustment. We are, in fact, informed that there would be no difficulty in arranging to house these two Intelligence Departments under one roof. In any case, even if some slight inconvenience were permanent, it would, we feel sure, be much more than counterbalanced by the advantages of the changes we propose.16. It would, of course, be difficult, if not impossible, to force upon an unwilling Foreign Office the new duties and responsibilities which are suggested, but, as will be seen from the annexed report, the Foreign Office, so far from objecting, have expressed a desire to undertake them and to carry out the reforms necessary, in order to make the proposed new departures a success. We think no obstacle should be placed in the way of the development within the Foreign Office of this commendable spirit of greater interest in commercial affairs.17. That the Board of Trade should hesitate about parting with a portion of the Commercial Intelligence Branch which it has built up is only natural, but we are more concerned with what we deem to be national interests than with departmental interests. For this reason we desire to state that we regard it as being of the greatest importance that members of the diplomatic service and of the Foreign Office should be assisted to realise that a knowledge of commercial matters is essential to their fitness to perform their duties, and to recommend that a certain minimum period of employment upon the commercial side be made a necessary qualification for promotion in each grade of the service, and that ample opportunities should be given to these officers to acquire a knowledge of commercial work through exchange of duties with the officers of the Intelligence Department and by other means.18. Having now dealt with the organisation of commercial intelligence, we proceed to consider the commercial policy which that organisation is intended to assist. We think it is impossible to sever questions of commercial policy in foreign countries from general foreign policy, of which they are an integral part. International relations in general depend, and must tend to depend more and more in future, upon commercial relations, and it is inevitable that foreign policy will consequently be affected to an ever increasing extent by commercial and industrial circumstances.&quot; We believe that any attempt to retard this development in the interests of mere administrative convenience W will react fatally upon the general interests of the country, and that a favourable development can only take place if those in charge of foreign affairs are kept in close and constant touch with commercial requirements.On the other hand, it is of equal importance that the general commercial and f industrial policy of the country shall be kept in the closest possible co-ordination with the foreign commercial policy, and above all that any measures taken to develop and improve industrial and other commercial activities at home or within the Empire shall [477] C
be taken with a full knowledge of facts relating to foreign trade. We believe that even the best organised intelligence service will be to a great extent useless unless in the sphere of policy the closest possible touch is kept between the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office, and that, while in order to secure the necessary directness of control, a sharp line of demarcation should be drawn between activities abroad (such as foreign commercial intelligence), which properly pertain to the sphere of the Foreign Office, and the regulation of industrial and other matters at home, which properly belong to the Board of Trade, this line of demarcation should not exist as regards matters of policy.19. In order to avoid any danger of conflicting advice being tendered to His Majesty&apos;s Government by the Board of Trade on the one hand, and the Foreign Office on the other, we recommend the setting up of a joint committee to deal with all matters of commercial policy. This committee, to keep up to date, should sit regularly at frequent intervals to consider, and, if necessary, to make recommendations to His Majesty&apos;s Government on all matters and measures relating to commercial treaties and policy (as distinct from the detailed administration of the duties respectively allotted to the Foreign Office and to the Board of Trade). This joint committee should, in our opinion, consist of a preponderance of representatives from the different departments of the Board of Trade, together with representatives of the Foreign Office, and several representative business men chosen from a panel selected by the most important commercial and industrial bodies of the country. This would render it unnecessary for the Foreign Office to have any separate &quot; advisory committee,&quot; and might possibly render a separate advisory committee of the Board of Trade superfluous.In any case, this joint committee would focus the knowledge and experience of the two Departments and of our business men at the point where it would be most serviceable in the general interests of the country. Possibly this joint committee might afterwards be further strengthened by the addition of representatives of the India andr Colonial Offices.20. Having thus disposed of the first part of our reference we come to the second part, which instructs us to &quot; consider whether the agreement between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade, dated the 3rd October, 1916, requires any and what amendment or alteration.&quot;In view of all we have submitted above, we think it is unnecessary to discuss this agreement in detail, as it must be evident that we consider that it should cease to be operative, and that an entirely different set of conditions should become applicable.We have the honour to be, Gentlemen,Your obedient Servants,G. C. Upcott, Secretary. April 4, 1917.(Signed) F. DUDLEY DOCKER.De F. PENNEFATHER. VICTOR WELLESLEY.Report by the Chairman and Sir W. H. Clark, K.C.S.I., C.M.G.To the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Right Honourable the President of the Board of Trade.Gentlemen,1. The terms of our reference direct us to enquire into the best form of organisation for promoting our foreign trade through representatives abroad, including the consular service, and in particular to consider whether the agreement between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade, dated^) the 3rd October, 1916, requires any and what amendment or alteration. In view of the wide interpretation which might be given to these terms, we felt it necessary at the outset of our deliberations to consider carefully what should be the scope of our enquiry. The organisation of the consular service, which must always be the foundation of any^:) system of commercial intelligence abroad, has been frequently investigated in recent years, notably by the Royal Commission on the Civil Service (Fifth Report, Cd. 7748 of
1914), and we have not felt it expedient to go in detail over the ground already covered by these and former enquiries. We have endeavoured rather to set^ forth what, in our view, should be the broad lines on which our commercial intelligence machinery should be organised, and have not attempted to deal with details of an administrative order or to frame estimates of the expenditure which will be required, if the principles which we recommend are adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. The scope of our enquiry having been thus defined, we have not found it necessary to take a large amount of evidence. * We have, however, had before us certain alternative official schemes for the improvement of our commercial intelligence service in foreign countries, namely : (1.) The proposals originally put forward by the Board of Trade, to which we referin paragraph 4 below; (2.) A scheme prepared by a Departmental Committee of the Foreign Office in1916, which we attach ; and (3.) The scheme contained in the agreement between the late Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the late President of the Board of Trade which,we understand, was arrived at as a result of their joint consideration ofschemes (1) and (2).We have also considered the reports issued by the Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom in December 1916 and January 1917, and the recommendations recently published by the Federation of British Industries, and we have lately had an opportunity of reading chapter 12 of the Final Report of the Dominions Royal Commission (Cd. 8462 of 1917), which deals with certain aspects of the matter.3. The questions at issue may be readily comprehended by comparison between the above-mentioned agreement and the proposals contained in the report of the Foreign Office Committee and they fall conveniently under the two following headings, viz. :  (1.) The position and duties of the commercial attache or trade commissioner abroad;(2.) The organisation in this country of the system of collecting enquiries from the commercial community, of framing instructions for the guidance of the agents abroad and disseminating the information contained from those agents.We think that the principles involved will be found to be clearly defined in our report, and, having regard to the desirability of extending our export trade after the war, we would emphasise the importance of a speedy decision upon these questions, in order that the new arrangements may be brought into effective operation before the end of the war.4. We understand that it was originally proposed by the Board of Trade that trade commissioners for service in foreign countries should be appointed by that Department on the advice of a selection committee on which the Foreign Office would be represented, but in the agreement referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, it was decided that commercial attaches at His Majestys Embassies and Legations should be replaced by trade commissioners who, in the first instance, should be appointed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade in consultation, the method of future appointment being left for further consideration. The commissioner would, under this agreement, be part of the diplomatic staff, and be directly subordinate to the head of the mission, but, subject to these and certain other conditions, he would be in effect an officer of, and responsible to, the Board of Trade. The system would be, as it is in fact intended to be, the counterpart of the service of trade commissioners which has been established in recent years by the Board of Trade in the self-governing Dominions.5. The evidence brought before us points to the necessity for a more vigorous and systematic collection of commercial intelligence, and we agree, therefore, that for this purpose the consular service should be supplemented by an organised service of permanent officers who should be stationed in foreign countries, and should devote their whole time to commercial matters. But both on grounds of general principle and also in view of the close relation which will necessarily exist between their duties and questions of foreign policy, and of the fact that they will be in constant touch with the -public in the foreign country in which they are stationed, we think it essential that
these officers should be appointed by, and should be under the control of, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. We recognise, however, the important interest of the Board of Trade in the matter, and, while we concur in the recommendation of the Foreign Office Committee that the existing system of commercial attaches should be organised and extended, we recommend that these officers should in future be appointed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs after consultation with the Board of Trade. Systematic methods should be devised in order to secure that, both in the preliminary consideration and in the final choice of candidates, such consultation is a reality, and while the final decision in case of difference must, of course, rest with the Secretary of State, the fullest opportunity of indicating their views should be given to the Board of Trade. We suggest that a selection committee might be appointed for the purpose, consisting of representatives of the two Departments and two or three business men.6. We are of opinion that the commercial attaches should receive diplomatic rank, and should be directly subordinate to the head of the mission in the country in which they are stationed, They should be recruited in future mainly by promotion from the consular service, subject to the strict understanding that such promotion is made, not on grounds of seniority, but in the light of proved capacity for the special commercial work required. At the same time it is in our judgment very important that a free hand should always be kept to select suitable officers from other sources, and in particular to appoint men of actual commercial experience from outside the public service. We believe that many well-qualified officers can now be found in the existing consular service, and we hope that the prospect of advancement to the post of commercial attache, by emphasising the importance of the commercial work of the service and by enhancing its attractiveness, will in course of time increase the number. But it must not be overlooked that the latter consideration will necessarily have a gradual effect only, and in view of the immediate necessity for an improved system of commercial intelligence we recommend that at the outset and for a certain number of years a proportion of appointments should be made from outside.   The salary should be sufficient to attract men of standing and ability.7. The duties of the commercial attache abroad should in our opinion be primarily those of an intelligence officer, that is, to report upon trade generally in the country to which he is accredited, to watch for and advise upon opportunities for the devolopment of British trade, and to furnish reports, both on his own initiative and in reply to enquiries addressed to him, upon all matters of commercial interest and importance. He should have authority to instruct consular officers, when necessary, to make enquiries and supply information to him on these matters. We recommend that he should be provided with an assistant and adequate clerical staff, and, wherever possible, with separate office accommodation, and that he should travel frequently throughout his district, and pay regular visits to this country with a view to meeting the commercial community.8. It has been represented to us on behalf of the Foreign Office that the commercial attache should also be the chief adviser of the head of the mission in commercial matters, and that he should be charged with the duties of superintending generally the commercial work of the consulates, of carrying out consular inspections and of making recommendations as to changes in consular establishments. We have no doubt that heads of missions will certainly desire to obtain the advice of experienced commercial attaches on questions with regard to which they will obviously have acquired expert knowledge. On the other hand our attention has been drawn to the view expressed in the report of Sir Eldon Gorst and Mr. (now Sir Hubert) Llewellyn Smith in 1906 (Cd. 3610 of 1907), lhat in missions which are the headquarters of a commercial attache there was a tendency to devolve on him all the current commercial work. The difficulties thus arising would no doubt be met to some extent if, as we propose, the commercial attache is provided with assistance, but we attach great importance to the view that the current secretarial work of a mission relating to commercial matters should be discharged by the ordinary diplomatic staff, who should be impressed with the importance of giving special study to such matters.9. Although it m&amp;y be found convenient in a certain number of cases to continue the present arrangements under which the commercial attache is charged with the duty of consular inspection, we do not think that as a general rule he should be required to perform administrative duties in relation to the consular service. We are convinced by the evidence given to us that in the Far East, for example, such arrangements would be impracticable ; and while the objections may be less serious in other parts of the
world, we are strongly of opinion that the efficiency of the commercial intelligence system is likely to be impaired, if it is necessary in the selection of the commercial attaches to have regard to their suitability for these inspection duties. This require-ment would make it difficult to select for these posts consuls of comparatively short service, who may often be the best fitted for purely intelligence work,^ and still more difficult to appoint men of commercial experience from outside the service. It would, we think, inevitably give rise to a tendency which, as we have already indicated, should in our opinion be guarded against, to limit the selection to officers of seniority in the consular service. We think that consular inspection should be the duty of the head of the mission, who would no doubt delegate his powers when he thought fit, and it would frequently happen that the most suitable officer for the duty would be the commercial attache.10. We proceed to consider what should be the commercial intelligence organisation in this country. This has hitherto consisted in the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade in the City, which has recently been reorganised as the Department of Commercial Intelligence by the amalgamation of that branch and the Exhibitions Branch of the Board. The Board of Trade are also assisted by an advisory committee on commercial intelligence, which includes representa-tives of certain public departments and of the Dominion Governments, as well as commercial members. The Board of Trade witness informed us that in the past the intelligence work of the Department has been hampered by insufficiency of staff both at home and abroad, and it is admitted that the absence of any recognised method of communication with the commercial attaches hitherto appointed has been a serious defect. The question of staff will now, it is hoped, be met without difficulty, and it was part of the original scheme put forward by the Board that instructions should be issued direct to the proposed trade commissioners in foreign countries by the Depart-ment of Commercial Intelligence, and that the commissioners should similarly send their reports to that department, heads of missions receiving copies for information. The agreement between Lord Grey and Mr. Runciman did not depart in principle from the proposed arrangement, but provided that, while the Department of Commercial Intelligence should correspond with the officers overseas, such correspondence should go through the Foreign Office under flying seal.11. Widely different proposals of a far-reaching nature have been laid before us on behalf of the Foreign Office. In the report of the Departmental Committee, mentioned in paragraph 2 above, it is proposed (paragraph 22) that a Foreign Trade Department should be established under the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs &quot; controlling the consular service and the commercial attaches, directing the system of intelligence derived from these agents, and keeping touch with those in this country who are engaged in foreign trade, so as to make available to them without delay the intelligence so obtained.&quot; It is further proposed that this department should be assisted by an advisory committee (paragraph 29) consisting of representatives ofthe Board of Trade, Foreign Office, Colonial Office, and India Office, and by a large number of panels of business men, representing each important branch of finance, industry, and commerce (paragraph 37).The position which it is suggested that the Board of Trade should occupy in relation to the proposed Foreign Trade Department is laid down in paragraph 43 of the report as follows : &quot; In order to avoid any misapprehension which may arise out of the proposals made in the preceding section, we make the following explanation: So long as channels are established to convey a sufficient flow of directive requests from the business community to the foreign services, we do not wish to make proposals for establishing such channels which would ignore the representative character of the Board of Trade in relation to the business community of this country. It is on this point that the joint advisory committee proposed in paragraph 29 of this report will be most useful in establishing from time to time the precise relations between the two Departments. , It does not seem to us that by assigning to the proposed organisation under the Foreign Trade Department, and especially to the commercial attache, the duties of the distributing as well as of the collecting side of the intelligence system, we are, in fact, neglecting the representative character of the Board of Trade, and we certainly do not wish to imply that the channels should not run through that Department in any case where the latter is prepared to undertake the transmission of the information desired. We do, however, feel it necessary to insist that personal touch of the closest and most constant kind [477] B
must exist between the Foreign Office and the business community, and we hardly think that this conclusion will be combated by anyone.&quot;12. We are convinced that mutual relations so obscurely defined would lead to confusion and overlapping of work and divergency of methods which would be extremely wasteful and highly inconvenient to the commercial community.It has, however, been urged before us in evidence that a clear line of demarcation should be drawn, and that the Foreign Trade Department should have exclusive charge of the collection and distribution of commercial intelligence as regards foreign countries, while the Department of Commercial Intelligence of the Board of Trade should confine its activities to purely domestic questions and the trade of the United Kingdom with the Empire overseas. There would, in fact, be two entirely distinct commercial intelligence departments the Foreign Trade Department, in Whitehall, and a department in the City for internal and Empire trade intelligence.13. We are unable to recommend the adoption of this scheme. In our opinion it is essential, both to sound administration and to the convenience of the commercial community, that there should be in this country a single department charged with the compilation and distribution of commercial intelligence, from whatever source it is obtained. The manufacturing and trading interests of this country in Imperial and foreign markets overseas cannot be absolutely separated, and to compel the British manufacturer or trader to seek information and advice as regards overseas trade from two separate departments, which would inevitably tend to work upon different lines and by different methods, would lead to serious inconvenience and waste of effort.14. Similarly, we do not believe that in connection with commercial intelligence work a distinction can satisfactorily be drawn between domestic and foreign trade. In this connection we entirely endorse the views expressed on the question of trade intelligence by the Dominions Royal Commission in their recently publ ished final report. They write (paragraph 638) :-&quot; It appears to us that any organisation for the purpose of fostering the trade or commerce of a country cannot and should not deal solely with economic opportunities abroad. Enquiries in oversea markets can only be properly directed and the results adequately utilised in the light of a full knowledge of individual requirements and industrial capabilities at home. The ideal Commercial Intelli-gence Department of any Government must therefore depend for efficient working as much on a staff of experts conversant with home industries as upon well-trained commercial representatives abroad.&quot;We conceive that the soundness of the principles laid down in the passage we have quoted will meet with general acceptance. They are, however, clearly inconsistent with a scheme such as that we are now discussing. The Board ol Trade is the only Depart-ment of Government which is in a position to acquire the necessary knowledge of industrial requirements and industrial capabilities in the United Kingdom. The peculiar functions of the Foreign Office as the Department of Government concerned with international relations are of quite a different order, and its staff, as is well known, is recruited under special arrangements, which have been designed solely in view of its diplomatic duties.15. We do not overlook the fact that the existing Foreign Trade Department, which has been established for the special purpose of administering the Statutory List during the war in certain countries, has thereby acquired valuable information relating to British trade in those countries and possible openings for its extension. The control which that Department now exercises over British export trade for the purposes of the war must, however, terminate with the war, and we strongly recommend that the experience and information obtained by it in the course of its special activities, together with such part of its staff as may be deemed advisable, should be placed at the disposal of the Department of Commercial Intelligence of the Board of Trade.16. We recommend therefore that the commercial intelligence organisation in this, country should remain in the hands of the Board of Trade.   It has been represented t(0 us that this arrangement results in a &quot;dual control&quot; of the consular officers and commercial attaches abroad, to which it is argued the existing defects of the service are due.   We think that this criticism rests upon a misapprehension.   The Department primarily responsible for the trade interests of the country as a whole is the Board of(% Trade,jwhich cannot divorce itself from interest in, and responsibility for, the promotion of British commercial interests in foreign markets.   On the other hand, trade matters
are constantly interwoven with questions of general policy for which the Foreign Office is responsible, and that Department must therefore be regularly consulted in connection with the administration of the commercial intelligence system, and must exercise control over the commercial agents of the Government in foreign countries. But we are convinced that, if the Foreign Office were to attempt in the manner proposed by the Departmental Committee to place itself in direct daily touch with the commercial community by means of the suggested panels of business advisers, grave evils would ensue which would far outweigh any difficulties arising from the necessity for joint action in relation to commercial intelligence. The advisers of the Government on questions of commercial policy are and must be in the first instance the Board of Trade, through which the views of the commercial community should be obtained. But, if business interests had alternative access direct to the Foreign Office, the tendency would inevitably arise for that Department to have separate recourse to its panels of trade advisers,&quot;and to revise the recommendations of the Board of Trade in the light of its own independent information, with the result that the Government might often receive conflicting advice from two Departments, each claiming to represent the commercial community.17. In the light of these considerations, it is our opinion that the proposals put forward by the Foreign Office Committee would be likely not only to cause incon-venience to the commercial community in this country, but also to lead to serious friction and embarrassment in departmental administration. The problem is one which must be met by co-operation and good-will between the Departments concerned, and, given these conditions, we think that the modifications of the existing machinery which we propose will be sufficient. We recommend that the general instructions to be given to the commercial attaches should be drawn up by the Board of Trade and Foreign Office in consultation, as has hitherto been the practice as regards the consular instructions. Particular enquiries which the Department of Commercial Intelligence may desire to address to the attaches should be transmitted through the Foreign Office and the head of the mission concerned. The reports of the attaches, whether made on their own initiative in pursuance of general instructions or in reply to specific enquiries addressed to them by the Department or by traders, should pass through the same channels. In order that co-operation between the two Departments may be ensured and delay avoided, we desire to urge that regular and frequent personal consultations should be maintained between the Comptroller-General of Commercial Intelligence and the Con-troll er of the Commercial and Consular Department of the Foreign Office.18. We are also of opinion that the advisory committee, to which we referred in paragraph ] 0, should be brought into more active relation with the Department of Commercial Intelligence,and we concur in the recommendation contained in paragraph 646 of the Final Report of the Dominions Royal Commission that a sub-committee of the committee should be appointed which should meet at frequent intervals and advise the Comptroller-General upon the current work of the Department.Although in our opinion the commercial intelligence organisation in this country should remain under the Board of Trade, we do not intend to imply that the activity of the&apos; Commercial Department of the Foreign Office should be curtailed, and we think it important that business men should continue to enjoy the freest access to that department whenever diplomatic support for British commercial interests abroad is desired.19. The commercial attaches should return at regular intervals to this country, and during the period of these visits they should be utilised to the fullest extent by the Department of Commercial Intelligence, and arrangements should be made by that department to enable them to pay visits to Chambers of Commerce at industrial centres and to meet traders.In addition to the foregoing arrangements, special trade missions should be arranged when the circumstances appear to warrant such a course, and it will no doubt be found convenient that such missions should be undertaken in some cases by a commercial attache specially detailed for the duty, and in other by means of the temporary appoint-ment of an outside commercial or technical expert, the temporary appointment to be approved by the Foreign Office.20. We have only to add certain recommendations as regards the consular service which are connected with the subjects of our enquiry. As already explained in paragraph 1 of this report, we do not think that any useful purpose would be served by Our attempting to undertake a general enquiry into the conditions of that service. Many of the criticisms directed against it arise from misapprehension of its proper functions, and we notice that similar criticisms are common in other countries.   We
think that the defects, which admittedly exist, will to a large extent be remedied by the reforms which we understand are contemplated as the result of recent enquiries, by the establishment of an organised service of commercial attaches on the lines which we have recommended, and by the gradual effect upon the consular service of the prospect of promotion to the grade of commercial attache.21. The number of consulates and the staffs to be attached to them should be considered by the Foreign- Office in the light of the probable requirements of British trade after the war. The evidence we have perused seems to point to a larger number of consuls being required. Wherever possible consuls should he natural-born British subjects.We desire to endorse the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service (Fifth Report, Part II, chapter ii, paragraph 6) that a longer period should be spent by consular probationers in the Department of Commercial Intelligence.22. We do not recommend any change in the existing arrangements under which that department is authorised to communicate direct with consular officers upon detailed trade enquiries and their replies are sent to it. Care should, however, be taken at the same time that the Foreign Office is kept in touch with the working of these arrange-ments, and we would suggest that consular officers should be instructed to forward to the Foreign Office copies of all communications, whether replies to enquiries or reports on their own initiative, which they may address to the Department of Commercial Inel ligence.Summary.23. Our main recommendations may be summarised as follows : (1.) For commercial intelligence purposes the consular service should be supple-mented by an organised service of commercial attaches appointed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, after consultation with the Board of Trade. A selection committee should be appointed, consisting of repre-sentatives of the two Departments and two or three business men. (Paragraph 5.)(2.) The commercial attaches should receive diplomatic rank, and should be directly subordinate to the head of the mission in the country in which they are stationed. They should be recruited mainly by promotion from the consular service, but a free hand should be kept to select officers from other sources, and at the outset a proportion of appointments should be made from outside.   (Paragraph 6.)(3.) The duties of a commercial attache should be primarily those of an intel-ligence officer, although the head of the mission should not be debarred from utilising his advice in commercial matters and entrusting him with consular inspections under certain conditions. He should be provided with adequate staff and separate office accommodation, if possible; should travel in his district, and pay regular visits to this country.   (Paragraphs 7-9.)(4.) There should be in this country a single commercial intelligence organisation, which should continue to be in the hands of the Board of Trade. (Para-&quot; graphs 13-16.)(5.) The general instructions to the commercial attaches should be drawn up by the Board of Trade and Foreign Office in consultation. Particular enquiries from the Department of Commercial Intelligence should be transmitted to them through the Foreign Office and the head of the mission concerned, and their reports should pass through the same channels. Co-operation between the two Departments should be ensured by means of regular and frequent personal consultations between the Comptroller-General of Com-mercial Intelligence and the head of the Commercial Department of the Foreign Office.   (Paragraph 17.)(6.) A sub-committee of the advisory committee on commercial intelligence should be appointed to advise the Comptroller-General of the Department of Commercial Intelligence upon the current work of his department. (Paragraph 18.)(7.) During their visits to this country the commercial attaches should be utilised by the Department of Commercial Intelligence, which should arrange for them to visit Chambers of Commerce and meet traders.   (Paragraph 19.)(8.) We add certain recommendations of detail regarding the consular service. (Paragraphs 20-22.)
Conclusion.w 24. The effective working of the intelligence system must, in our opinion, dependupon the cordial co-operation of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade. While laying down the general principle that the Foreign Office should control the service abroad, and that the Board of Trade should control the organisation in this country, we recognise that there is a borderland where the two Departments must be in intimate touch, and we desire, in conclusion, to emphasise again the importance of close personal relations between their responsible officers.We have the honour to be, Gentlemen,Your obedient Servants,(Signed)        FAEINGDON, Chairman.

APPENDIX.Report of Foreign Office Committee.(1-)GENERAL PRINCIPLES.1. THE objects and functions of any Government organisation to promote and assist British, trade in foreign countries are (1.) To collect, co-ordinate, and present all information relating to tlie trade, industries, and shipping of those countries in such a way as to (i.) enable the Government to form a correct appreciation oi the general commercial relations between the British Empire and the several foreign countries from the point of view of British commercial interests ;(ii.) afford advice to the Government on questions arising in connection with, the negotiation of commercial treaties and tariffs, based on a comprehensive knowledge of the commercial geography, history, legislation, and actual conditions of the foreign countries concerned ;(iii.) enable the Government to furnish to British traders reliable information as to (a.) local laws, rules, regulations, and trade customs; (6.) existing or potential markets for British exports ; (c.) supplies needed by, or useful to, British industries, which areor may be produced in the countries concerned ; (d.) openings for British capital in developing the natural resourcesand general commercial prosperity of such countries; (e.) suitable agents for British firms in foreign countries ;(2.) To facilitate the efforts of British traders to get into touch with the mercantile and industrial community in foreign countries as well as with the national or local authorities where necessary ;(3.) To enable the Government to promote, and if necessary assist in negotiating through its agents abroad, commercial or industrial concessions to British subjects, where such concessions are of sufficient importance to call for Government intervention;(4.) To afford, within the limits of diplomatic or consular action, assistance in composing or smoothing over any difficulties that may arise between British subjects in the exercise of their trade or legitimate commercial activity, and foreign government or local authorities.*2. In order to carry out the objects above indicated, there must be (a.) a body of agents distributed over foreign countries ; and(6.) an authority at home who appoints and controls the agents abroad ; to whomthe latter report; and who informs and advises the Government and thetrading community.3. The principles governing the intercourse between independent States require that the relations of each with each be treated as a Unit and conducted as a whole. For it is only a Sovereign or Government representing the State as a unit that is capable of entering into such relations, and, as the mouthpiece of the State as a single body, the Sovereign or Government must speak with one voice, that is, the voice of ^   the particular officer to whom the conduct of foreign relations is specifically entrusted.4. There cannot be a British foreign policy as regards commercial matters abroad separate from general foreign policy, of which it forms an integral and important part.* It is not the function of Government agents in foreign countries to take any part in the actual m  , carrying-on of a traders private business ; to assume responsibility for individual commercial transactions ; ^     to collect privats debts; interfere in ordinary trade disputes; or intervene in private litigation on behalf of British claimants, save in exceptional cases and on the express authority of the Secretary of State.[477] &apos; F
There may be special agents charged more particularly with carrying on in a foreign country the commercial side of foreign policy. But if there is to be unity of foreign policy, such agents must derive their authority and receive their instructions from the same Minister who directs the general foreign policy ; and, as a general rule, unity and efficiency in policy will best be secured by the greatest possible consolidation of all such agents with the permanent foreign service.5. Similarly, in so far as the Minister may have to be furnished with expert advice in regard to questions of commercial foreign policy, such advice must, if unity is to be preserved, be submitted to him by or through the Government Department whose function it is to advise in matters of general foreign policy.(HONEED FOR LARGER ORGANISATION.6. We have thought it right at the commencement of our report to define the objects and the limitations of a foreign trade organisation, and we desire to emphasise the fact that one of the main reasons, though not the only one, for proposing a more comprehensive intelligence system on the lines of this report is the prospect of the enlarged duties likely to be imposed on the Government in the future.7. In the past, the extent to which, and the manner in which, commercial intelligence has been made available for the British trader has left much to be desired, but this cannot, in our view, be attributed, except in very small measure, to lack of energy on the part of officials either in the Foreign Office or the Board of Trade, and still less to lack of efficiency on the part of consular officers abroad. Much good work has, on the contrary, been done in all departments, and if the result has on the whole been disappointing, this is because there has been insufficient consolidation of responsibility or definition of duties necessary to a sound administrative system. These defects have, in their turn, been fundamentally due to the fact that the nature of the trade carried on, and more particularly the attitude of successive Governments towards foreign trade, have been such as to cause no demand for any complete and active organisation by the Government which, while supplementing individual enterprise, might have tended to influence the policy and direction of that trade.8. For the last half century successive Governments in this country have not thought it right to take an active part in directing the development of foreign trade. This has resulted from various causes, and especially from the fear of governmental interference and from the competitive character of the relations of British traders among themselves. Distrust of governmental interference, a distrust common to both traders and Governments, has tended to create, in the mind of both, a confusion between the idea of interference and that of legitimate Government assistance, and the normal reaction on trade produced by such assistance has been wrongly regarded in the light of dictatorial intervention.9. The British trader exporting to a foreign market has done so not merely in competition with Germans and Americans, but with his own countrymen; in many cases, being slow to realise the dangerous extent to which German and American competition was affecting the position of British exports, he has preferred to use German distributing agencies as more likely to enable him to maintain his own export business in competition with other British exporters, and he has therefore not placed much value on consular and commercial information or assistance which are open both to him and his British competitors.10. In comparing our commercial organisation with that of other countries, we have to remember that in other countries there has been a constant touch between the Govern-ment and the commercial community, arising from the periodical revision of highly complex tariffs. Such tariffs have not only necessitated a much more complete system of commercial intelligence on the part of the Governments, but have drawn together those affected by them into associations much more representative than any of our Chambers of Commerce. This more complete intelligence system, ana the better organisation of those for whose use it is intended, have reacted on each other so as to cause a definite &apos; demand, which has obtained a suitable supply. Not only has this country omitted to create or use fully adequate channels of information, but other functions also of an efficient commercial intelligence organisation, such as the rendering of active diplomatic assistance in obtaining commercial or industrial concessions, or in obtaining orders for f British supplies in connection with loans for foreign States, have been rarely exercised except to some degree of recent years.
11 For these and other reasons, the Foreign Office has not been in a position to f develop an organisation such as exists in other countries and, m the absence of any effective stimulus to the systematic collection of information relating to foreign trade through the consuls and commercial attaches, the function of collecting such information has not been definitely allocated, but has been discharged partly by one department, and partly by another, according as enquiries chanced to be addressed to, or subjects of interest happened to be brought to the notiee of, the Board of Trade, the commercial attache, the Foreign Office, or a diplomatic officer abroad. Diplomatic activity in support of British trade has been inadequate in precise proportion as the collection of information has been deficient, and the two are interdependent.12. During the war, however, we have committed ourselves in many ways which make a return to old methods impossible. A policy has, for instance, been adopted of discouraging and, indeed, preventing British exporters from distributing their exports through enemy firms established in foreign countries, and efforts have been made to find British, Allied, or neutral substitutes. This policy has been attended by many inconveniences and some loss to individuals, due largely to the want of information as to the substitutes available. It is fair, however, to add that the aggregate export has probably not been affected seriously, for the British firms established abroad have succeeded to the trade previously done through enemy channels.13. These and like war measures are, according to the resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference, to become, during the period of reconstruction after the war, the basis of a policy consciously directed towards the maintenance of the Quadruple Alliance against German encroachment. This not only provides a great opportunity for the use of an extended and improved commercial intelligence organisation ; it also necessitates a very close observation of the tendencies of neutral nations, especially the United States, with whose interests so far-reaching an economic policy must be constantly adjusted by diplomatic effort, and it opens up a vista of complicated and detailed negotiations with foreign Governments entailed by any system of reciprocal commercial arrangements.14. While new demands are thus about to be made upon the Foreign Office in regard to policy, the war will also leave on our hands a mass of information, more or less digested, which has been collected by the Foreign Office, the War Trade Intelligence Department, the Foreign Trade Department, and other departments in the course of regulating war trade. The proper co-ordination, tabulation, and use of this information at the end of the war will in itself be a work of the first magnitude. Much of it has been concentrated in the Foreign Office, more than in any other executive department, and the possession of this information in a properly digested form will be of the greatest importance to that office in the execution of the new policy abroad. The method of dealing with all this information in such a way as to make it the raw material for the discharge by the Foreign Office of its enlarged responsibilities in foreign countries needs to be carefully considered.lo. Though the tendency of the above considerations leads towards the conclusion that the commercial intelligence system abroad must be allocated to the sphere of the Foreign Office, it is impossible, however the problem may be regarded, to create any organisation under the Foreign Office which will not depend for its success upon close co-operation between it and the Board of Trade, corresponding to the inevitable interaction between the commercial and industrial policy of the country and its foreign policy abroad. In our opinion, the logical basis for such co-operation lies in the accepted principle that the Foreign Office ultimately controls, and the Board of Trade advises in, all questions abroad, while the Board of Trade controls, and the Foreign Office may be in a position to advise in, questions at home; the advice in each case being the product of the separate executive responsibilities of each department in its own sphere.16. Thus, in order to carry out the new policy, and to base it on the new information already collected and to be collected in future, the Foreign Office must be linked far more intimately to the Board of Trade as being the department charged with the general, commercial, and industrial policy of the country than it has been % before, and must be enabled to co-operate more closely and continuously with it.17. Many conditions which have been favourable in other countries to linking up the commercial community with the Government commercial intelligence organisation will also prevail here, and what was probably impossible in the past has now become ^ not only possible but a matter of urgent necessity.18. We are now committed to a national trade policy which will enter largely into the conduct of our foreign relations and may dominate them.
19. In future the instructions issued to our diplomatists must place trade and. finance in a different relation to general policy than was the case before the war, and their action in regard to such matters will therefore take on a new character. Trade and finance can no longer be things apart, outside the sphere of their general diplomatic work. Trade and finance must become an essential subject of their study. The way for this has been prepared, and the attitude of the foreign service has already been radically altered by the work done, the experience gained, and the information collected during the war, and it is therefore a question of maintaining and extending tendencies already fairly well established.20. If this view is correct, there will be little difficulty in organising a department of the Foreign Office on large lines worthy of its importance. There must be no divorce between those concerned with the trade side and those concerned in general foreign policy, and care must be taken that, in emoluments, promotion, and ultimate prizes and rewards, this view is put into practice.21. Even if many of the assumptions made above as to the institution of a new trade policy after the war were to prove erroneous, the necessity for the organisation we are about to propose would remain; since a more vigorous and systematic collection of commercial intelligence will in any case be demanded, and the control of any organisation for that object by the Foreign Office is called for by the considerations put forward in the first section of this report. Moreover, British trade will need not. only information, but specifically diplomatic assistance, closely adjusted to the trend of the information collected, and this essential duty cannot be properly performed if diplomacy and intelligence are under different systems of control.22. The main features of any organisation seem to be :  (1.) A Foreign Trade Department under the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, controlling the consular service and the commercial attaches, directing the system of intelligence derived from these agents and keeping touch with those in this country who are engaged in foreign trade so as to make available to them without delay the intelligence so obtained ;(2.) Such a measure of consolidation between the foreign service, the Foreign Trade Department, and the other branches of the Foreign Office as will enable the whole service to acquire knowledge of trade matters and of the working of the intelligence system ;(3.) Close co-operation, through an advisory committee, with the Board of Trade and other departments charged with the care of British industry, internal transport and shipping, so that the foreign trade policy, and the direction of intelligence in accordance with that policy, may be shaped and carried out in conformity with the practical considerations arising on the one hand from domestic policy, and on the other from the situation in, and our relations with, foreign countries.26. W e have accordingly framed proposals for such an organisation on these lines. 24. In proceeding to our detailed proposals, we wish to emphasise two points which apply to them generally : (1.) It would, in our opinion, be desirable that if the Secretary of State should approve the general scheme set out in this report or any of the suggestions for detailed organisation made in connection therewith, the recommendations so approved should, in so far as they apply to matters within the present competence of the Foreign Office, be put&apos; in force as soon as possible, and that, where necessary, detailed instructions in this sense should be issued to the officials concerned.(2.) In considering the important questions of personnel, methods of promotion, salaries, &amp;c., arising out of our recommendations, we are precluded from making any very detailed recommendations by the fact that these questions are inseparable from the consideration of various recommendations made by the Royal Commission on the Civil Service in its fifth report (1914), a matter which does not seem to lie within the scope of this report, and we^ have consequently confined ourselves to a general statement of the require-ments which will be essential if the scheme here proposed is to be carried out efficiently.
(in.)ORGANISATION OF A FOREIGN TRADE DEPARTMENT.25. A Foreign Trade Department should be created under the Foreign Office, and, indeed, within the Foreign Office. It should consist of three sections-the Consular Section, the Commercial Section, and the Section of Commercial Intelligence. The whole department should be put under the immediate direction of a permanent official as Controller, with the rank and status of an Assistant Under-Secretary. The development of this department and the organisation of its work will demand great administrative energy, and the direction of its activities within the framework of the general foreign policy will make serious and continuous demands on the time and attention of the responsible Minister. In order to assist and relieve the Secretary of State as much as possible in the discharge of these duties, it is suggested that, following the recent analogy of the delegation to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, subject always to the Secretary of State&apos;s ultimate control, of the special work connected with the enforce-ment of the blockade, the Foreigu Trade Department should be placed under a second Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. In principle, this is no very great innovation, since analogous arrangements exist already in the War Office and Admiralty. The relation of the whole department to the Permanent Under-Secretary is a point on which we only desire to touch tentatively, but we would suggest that while the second Parliamentary Under-Secretary should deal directly with the Secretary of State, the Permanent Under-Secretary must be kept constantly informed of the work of the department by the circulation of papers, and the department must be actually under his supervision in order to enable him to carry out the requirement, which we regard as - essential, that the staff of the Foreign Trade Department and of the other branches of the Foreign Office should be consolidated by constant interchange of personnel.26. The additional Parliamentary Under-Secretary, or whoever will preside over the Foreign Trade Department, must have the means of direct, immediate, and constant access to the Secretary of State. He must at the same time be equally approachable on his part by the officials of his department, who, in turn, must remain in the closest touch with the Permanent Under-Secretary, and with the staff of the political and other departments of the Foreign Office. It follows that the Foreign Trade Department must bodily be incorporated in the office, and be lodged under the same roof. We regard this as, in the long run, an essential feature of its proper organisation, whatever temporary expedients in the matter of housing it may be necessary to adopt now, or continue, during the period of reorganisation, immediately after the war. Location in another building means separation and disintegration. The department would at once and necessarily tend to become a more or less independent body, correspondence would take the place of personal intercourse, the necessary co-ordination and subordination would be gravely impaired, and rapidity of action on the lines indicated by the constantly varying aspects of the complex play of foreign relations would become impossible.27. We are ^ aware that the addition of a large new department to the existing establishment raises some practical difficulties. But we believe these can be over-come once the necessity for this development is recognised. We are convinced, moreover, that a not inconsiderable increase of the normal staff of the Foreign Office will in any case be required after the war, so that the question of fresh accommodation will have to be faced quite apart from the creation of an enlarged commercial establishment.28. Jn view of the emphasis which we have laid upon the close connection between the commercial side of the work of the Foreign Office and its political side, we recognise that the relations between the Foreign Trade Department and the political departments of the office and the exact methods of keeping the two in close touch are subjects for careful consideration, but, given the constant supervision of the Permanent Under-Secretary, we see no difficulty in securing this. Experience may show that a closer consolidation of this or that branch of commercial work with the work of the political departments may be desirable, and devolution from the Foreign lrade Department may therefore become necessary, but we prefer to leave these possibilities to be worked out in the course of practical administration. It appears in any case self-evident that the transition from the war period, involving the collection and co-ordmation of existing information and the elaboration of methods for taking advantage of, or where necessary continuing, portions of the war trade work as [477] G
elements in permanent policy will make a separate Trade Department necessary to begin with., whatever measures of devolution may become necessary at a later period, when the lines of organisation and policy have been laid down.29. In order to carry out the recommendation made under heading (3) at the end of the second section of this report (see paragraph 22 above), we propose that a permanent joint advisory committee be constituted, composed of representatives of the Board of Trade, Foreign Office, Colonial Office, and India Office (say two members from each). This committee should advise as to the regulation of the respective spheres of the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office; as to the maintenance of methods of communication between the business community at home and the foreign service abroad adequate to seeure a constant flow of information from one to the other; and as to the establishment of proper relations between the commercial intelligence system and the Dominion, Colonial, and Indian Governments.(IV.)THE WORK OF THE FOREIGN TRADE DEPARTMENT.30. The Foreign Trade Department will have to undertake :  (1.) The execution of trade policy abroad in general.(2.) The direction and administration of the consular and commercial attache services. Some suggestions as to broad lines of direction and administra-tion are given later in our Report. - (3.) The digestion of the accumulated war trade information already alluded to, and the current intelligence work. This will be the duty of the Com-mercial Intelligence Section of the department, and is the main subject of this Report. We must therefore make some general remarks on the nature of the intelligence machinery to be set up.31. Every intelligence system must necessarily consist of two parts, a collecting and a distributing side. The collecting side consists of the diplomatic service, the consular service and the commercial attaches. The distributing side is at present represented by the Board of Trade and its Commercial Intelligence Branch. In order that the collecting side should act with the maximum of efficiency and the minimum of effort, it must be made to correspond very closely with the needs and requirements of the trading community at home. This implies a strong direction from the distributing side. Without it the whole system can be but partially successful, for the absence of direction means a vast amount of ill-directed effort, waste of energy, and consequent loss in general efficiency.32. This much-needed direction has not hitherto been forthcoming from the distributing .side. Hence the cause of the failure of the commercial attache system and the criticism levelled against both the commercial attaches and consular service.-Experience has shown that the dual control exercised by the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office over the collection and distribution of information does not conduce to full and harmonious co-operation. Whatever the causes of this defect may have been, there can be but, one remedy for it, namely, that the purely intelligence work should be subject to single control under the Foreign Trade Department. There is evidence to show that the same difficulties as to allocation of commercial work between the Government departments have been experienced in other countries, and that the principle of entrusting the intelligence branch to the department responsible for foreign affairs is gaining recognition in such countries as Germany, France, and Belgium.33. As a basis for consideration, the present Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade may be taken as showing the classes of work with which the Foreign Trade Department will have to cope. In Appendix I to this Report will be found a more or less detailed examination of these classes of work and of the methods which should be introduced to establish each class on a proper basis. It is sufficient here to recommend strongly the proposals made in this Appendix, and principally the proper use and publication of manuals of standing information and the compilation of detailed lists of foreign firms.34. While, h owever, the adoption of these recommendations will clear up and put on a business-like basis a large body of work, the partial discharge of which by the Foreign Office and the Commercial Intelligence Branch has in the past involved much duplication,
m overlapping, and waste of energy, there remains the whole system of special reports &quot; from the &quot; collecting side &quot; on questions arising from day to day, as well as the annual reports for the various consular districts and countries. A detailed examination of the best manner of systematising such reports is contained in Appendix II. We recom-mend that the system stated in that appendix be adopted. At the present moment, there is, we feel, a deplorable lack of systematisation of such reports, resulting in much misdirected effort as well as in the absence of reports on many subjects of the first importance, owing to complete uncertainty on the part of the foreign services as to whether such reports are needed, or will be used, or noticed, at home. It is this want of direction and consequent discouragement of the foreign services which, in our opinion, provides the strongest argument in favour of the definite abolition of any conditions such as, at present, entail dual control over the &quot; collecting side.&quot;(v.)CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FOREIGN TRADE DEPARTMENT AND  THE BUSINESS  COMMUNITY.35. A reference to Appendices I and II will show that the proposals there made are wholly dependent on close touch being constantly maintained with the business community at home. This touch should be operative at all points of the organisation, and, so far as possible, in all ranks of the service. The methods of securing this object fall under three heads : (A.) Direct Communication with the Foreign Trade Department.36. All the officials of the Foreign Trade Department should be freely accessible -to business men. This applies in particular to the senior officials and to the com-mercial and assistant commercial attaches, who, during their periods of residence in this country, should have offices in the department; but the efficiency of the organi-sation will very largely depend on the extent to which the junior officials of the department are encouraged and given opportunities to act in the same spirit, and to communicate with, and take the advice of, business men in the course of their work.(B.) Paneh of Trade Advisers.37. Advisers specially qualified to represent the needs and possibilities of particular branches of British finance, industry, and trade are essential to any proper official organi-sation. The Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade has attempted to fill this need by the institution of one large Advisory Committee, which is consulted on general matters of organisation and policy. There are, however, certain objections to this solution. It is evident that the value of the advice which can be obtained by a department from its commercial advisers depends upon the extent to which the latter are actively engaged in the business about which they are consulted, and also upon the departments range of selection. Unless the department is to be spoon-fed by its advisers, it must have a certain freedom in choosing them from among the persons specially qualified in each case. We therefore recommend that the expert advice required should be drawn by the Foreign Trade Department from a large number of panels, representing each important branch of finance, industry, and commerce. In order to secure the greatest possible range of advice, and to interest the largest possible number of business men in the work of the department, we recommend that one-third of each panel should retire periodically, and be replaced by new members. The appointment of the panels, and the problem of keeping them free from improper influence or unduly self-interested motives, will always be difficult, but recent experience has shown that this difficulty is not insurmountable. Their functions must, ^however, be exclusively advisory, and they should not intervene in questions of administration.(C.) Visits to Centres of Industry.m 38. The senior officials of the Foreign Trade Department should, whenever necessary and possible, visit centres in the United Kingdom with a view to acquaint themselves with the situation and needs of the various industries and exports.   While
0this responsibility must, of course, fall upon the senior officials of the department, the department will, we hope, be largely staffed by younger men from all the foreign I services as well as by consular probationers. It has frequently been urged in all proposals for improving the consular service that probationers should visit the important industrial and mercantile centres in the United Kingdom before going abroad. While we believe that such &quot; sight-seeing&quot; visits have their value as an elementary education, yet we do not think that real training is acquired in such ways, or in any way except by the actual discharge of professional work. It is therefore important that juniors and probationers in the department should, as their capacities allow, be sent periodically to centres of business in the United Kingdom. In this way they could prepare the ground in advance for the visits of commercial attaches, or of senior officials of the department who may have to visit such centres on particular business, and they would acquire, in the course of such duties, an acquaintance with the community and a knowledge of the local interests which would stand them in good stead when they go abroad. The extent to which such a system of regular visits by juniors can be developed is one of administration, and can only be determined by experience, but we hope that it may be found possible to adopt the principle as a recognised part of the commercial intelligence organisation. The visits of juniors must be, to a considerable extent, subsidiary to the visits of the commercial attaches. The latter form, in a peculiar way, the direct link between the business community at home and the intelligence service abroad in all matters of current commercial intelligence.39. The present system of sending commercial attaches to visit periodically the more important industrial and commercial centres of the United Kingdom has suffered from certain defects which should be remedied. The visits were, in the first place, exclusively confined to granting private interviews at chambers of commerce. These personal interviews are certainly much appreciated by those who have taken advantage of them, but they do hot, except quite incidentally, afford the commercial attaches any insight into the larger issues of industrial developments, or enable them to become acquainted with the needs and requirements of trades as a whole. For this, closer touch with trade associations, general meetings of the chambers of commerce and similar methods are necessary. In the second place, these visits have not been brought nearly prominently enough to the notice of the public, with the result that after nearly ten years&apos; experience it is no exaggeration to say that the great bulk of merchants and manufacturers are still ignorant of the existence of such a system. Again, the visits have been arranged somewhat at random, and the commercial attache has been far too much at the mercy of the secretaries of the chambers, upon whose good-will the success of these visits largely depends.40. In order to remedy these defects, the visits should be arranged with greater discrimination by the central organisation, and should be more extensively advertised. They should be restricted as&quot; far as possible to the more important centres, and should be notified to the chambers of commerce, trade associations, and other interested parties some weeks in advance. The Foreign Trade Department should acquaint itself, through the medium of personal visits to the local centres, with the nature of the enquiries with which the commercial attache will have to deal, should ascertain whether visits from other commercial attaches would be welcome, and should generally encourage people to take advantage of the Government machinery. In addition to the time allotted to private interviews, the commercial attache should devote one clay to calling a meeting of the chamber to invite suggestions and criticisms on the system as a whole.41. With a view to utilise the results of such visits, the following system has been adopted with very satisfactory results by certain commercial attaches for some years past. The commercial attache draws up a report on the visit in the form of a printed memorandum, and circulates it to the consuls in the countries which he represents. As there will always be a certain number of questions put to him which he cannot answer on the spot, the consuls have standing instructions to furnish the information required within one month from the date of the receipt of the memorandum. These replies are collected at the Foreign Office, their contents noted, . i and forwarded in a batch to the enquirer.42. Arising out of such regular methods of communication between the official organisation and the business community, it will probably become possible to systematise many of the reports on particular industries which tend at present to be prepared by the foreign services in a somewhat haphazard way, according to the    I interests or ideas of each reporting officer.   For instance, it may be possible to obtain
from trade associations or other kindred bodies standard questionnaires on each trade or industry requiring regular reports from the foreign services, together with such notes on the nature of the industry as will furnish a guide to the reporting officer in his investigations. Work on these lines is already proceeding. Wherever the system can be applied, it will be possible in future to make the reports on such subjects uniform throughout the consular service, with the corresponding advantage that they can be easily compiled and rendered available to the persons interested in this country.(VI.)POSITION OF THE HOARD OF TRADE IN RELATION TO THE FOREIGN TRADE DEPARTMENT.43. In order to avoid any misapprehension which may arise out of the proposals made in the preceding section, we make the following explanation : So long as channels are established to convey a sufficient flow of directive requests from the business community to the foreign - services, we do not wish to make proposals for establishing such channels which would ignore the representative character of the Board of Trade in relation to the business community of this country. It is on this point that the Joint Advisory Committee proposed in g 29 of this Report will be most useful in establishing from time to time the precise relations between the two departments. It does not seem to us that, by assigning to the proposed organisation under the Foreign Trade Department, and especially to the commercial attache, the duties of the distributing as well as of the collecting side of the intelligence system, we are in fact neglecting the representative character of the Board of Trade, and we certainly do not wish to imply that the channels should not run through that department in any case where the latter is prepared to undertake the transmission of the information desired. We do, however, feel it necessary to insist that personal touch of the closest and most constant kind must exist between the Foreign Office and the business community, and we hardly think that this conclusion will be combated by anyone.(VII.)ORGANISATION ABROAD.(A.) The Commercial Attache.44. Every part of the foreign services must be brought into active relation with the Foreign Trade Department, but the central point of the organisation abroad must be the commercial attache. There is at present a considerable lack of system in the commercial attache service. At this moment the service is composed of some ten persons, drawn for the most part from the paid or unpaid consular service, with nominal seniority according to date of appointment, but with emoluments and conditions of rank bearing no relationship to years of service. In our opinion, these conditions must be remedied, and the service must be built up into a regular branch of the foreign services, with definite methods of recruitment, promotion, and rewards. A large increase in the service, both as regards number of posts and size of staffs, such as will in any case be found necessary, will make this possible, and a more developed grading of the service will furnish the prospects and inducements which are at present lacking.45. The commercial attaches should be mainly recruited from the consular service, and their posts should be recognised as a normal reward for efficiency in the discharge of consular duties, more especially of those relating to commerce. We do not wish to exclude the possibility of the appointment of Foreign Office officials or diplomats to such posts, as some freedom in this respect is a corollary of the principle of constant interchange of personnel which we have advocated in Section (III). Nor do we wish to exclude the appointment, of specially qualified men from outside the services in particular cases, so long as such persons become members of the service in the ordinary way with all its implications, their fitness to discharge all the duties of the post being taken into consideration equally with their commercial training. But we do lay it down as a principle that the commercial attache service must be a regular part of the government service, and that variations from the ordinary course of appointment must be^ brought within the same limits as those recognised as necessaiy to preserve the special character of the Civil Service in general, and to furnish proper professional inducements to its members. The infusion of the professional business element into the work of the commercial intelligence system is very necessary, but this element will, as a general rule, be supplied with &quot;better results, both to the public service and to the business community itself, by the appointment from time to time of [477] 1 H
specialists to report on particular trades or commercial problems, as advocated in paragraph 70 below, than by a confusion of that element with the commercial attache service.46. The commercial attache should have his headquarters abroad, unless there are special reasons against this in any particular case. He should, however, visit the United Kingdom as often as possible. He should have diplomatic rank and be under the authority of His Majesty&apos;s representative or representatives in the country or countries forming his district. He should not be a member of the chancery, and should not be expected to do the routine commercial work of the mission. He should, where possible, have a separate office and be provided with a separate staff. The size of the staff must be a matter for administrative consideration in each case, but we think that it should never be less than one assistant commercial attache and a clerk.47. The post of assistant commercial attache should be a regular grade in the commercial attache service, and consuls should pass through this grade before appointment as commercial attaches. The grading and rank of the service might follow some such lines as the following : Assistant Commercial Attache-Second Secretary. After ten years&apos; service from date of first appointment as Assistant Commercial Attache First Secretary.After fifteen years&apos; service Counsellor; provided he has been promoted to the full commercial attacheship.48. The commercial attache should be charged with the duties of consular inspection. If there is to be close and ordered co-operation between the consuls and the commercial attaches, it is absolutely necessary that the latter should be placed in a position of authority over the consuls, and should be the intermediary in general between the diplomatic and consular services. The function of consular inspection is a corollary of this position, and as the commercial attache must be in constant personal touch with the consuls, he can judge their efficiency more thoroughly and discharge the duties of inspection more economically than can be done by the periodical visits of special inspectors, who have no function but inspection and no immediate connection with the work done by the consul. We are aware that the Royal Commission reported that they saw &quot; strong objection to entrusting these functions to Commercial Attaches, whose proper duties lie in another direction and are of sufficient importance to occupy their whole time.&quot; But we think we are justified in disregarding this recommendation in virtue of our proposals as to the provision of an adequate staff for the commercial attache and his conversion from his present status as a kind of free lance into a member of a definite branch of the foreign service in every country. We do not, however, wish to exclude periodical visits of officials of the Foreign Trade Department to consulates, and indeed we believe that the officials of the consular section of that department should visit consulates as much as possible in order to get into touch with the personnel of the services they are administering. This is, however, a different matter from regular inspection, and can, as a general rule, only be applied to consulates in fairly close proximity to the United Kingdom.4;.). Before passing on to other parts of the foreign service, we desire to emphasise as strongly as possible that the position of the commercial attache must be regarded as the key to the whole proposed organisation, and that unless the necessity of proper pay and proper staffs is faced, the whole organisation must inevitably lapse into stagnation. However much the commercial attache may be assisted or supplemented by members of the diplomatic and consular services, or by experts specially appointed from the business community to report on particular subjects, it is in the ultimate analysis only by his constant activity and initiative that intelligence and direction will circulate freely between the business community and the official service, and he must be given whatever pay and staff is necessary in order to free him from routine office work and give his initiative full play.(B.) Diplomatic Service.50. Members of the diplomatic service should be accustomed to the idea that they are expected to participate in commercial work as much as in political work. Proficiency in commercial work might well be made a qualification for the post of Counsellor. Diplomats of all ranks should pass periods of employment in the Foreign Trade Department, and juniors should, as much as possible, be employed temporarily in the commercial attached office abroad.
51. We are in agreement with the recommendations of the Royal Commission that the post of secretary in charge of commercial affairs in the chancery, together with the allowance attached thereto, should be abolished, and that it should be clearly understood that every diplomat is expected to occupy himself with commercial matters.52. The q uestion of requiring some training in economic subjects for junior members of the diplomatic service is well worth consideration. We hold strongly that the best training is always obtained by the actual discharge of professional duties, and that the economic training of the junior diplomat will be best carried out by giving him work during his employment in the Foreign Trade Department as well as abroad which will necessitate his taking the advice of, and co-operating with, business men. At the same time, we do not see why diplomats during their employment at home should not go through some such course of training as that given by the London School of Economics to army officers.(C.) Consular Service.53. In view of what has been said above with regard to the commercial attache service, we have to consider the consular service, both as a service in itself and as a preparatory service for the post of commercial attache. We do not wish to overload this Report by detailed recommendations as to methods of recruitment for the consular service and such like. These, and many other points arising from our Report, must be left to the decision of those responsible for the administration of the foreign services, and are hardly suited for the deliberations of a committee like the present.  We only intend, therefore, to lay down very general lines of improvement.54. The consular service is the base on which alone any proper commercial intelligence system can rest. The staffs and to a less degree, perhaps-the pay of the consular service are at present often quite inadequate for the work. Consuls are overwhelmed by duties which are, indeed, proper to the consular service and must always be discharged by them, but which, so long as the staffs are, as at present, reduced to a minimum, prevent the consuls from devoting their time to the duties of commercial intelligence. It is useless to devise any system of commercial intelligence unless the attitude of the Government and of the country as a whole in regard to adequate provision for the consular service is fundamentally altered.(i.) Entrance into the Consular Service.55. The consular service must continue to be a regular part of the Civil Service. The training required is not the same as that required for a business man in any particular line of business. The consul cannot, and should not, be an expert in any particular line of business. He has general functions of advice in regard to the whole field of British trade, and requires a peculiar type of knowledge of that field which hardly any business man possesses, and which no ordinary business man can be expected to acquire in the course of the active conduct of his business.56. The peculiar training needed by members of the consular service can, as we have already emphasised, be best obtained by the practical discharge of their professional duties, and consequently that training must largely be acquired after their entrance into the service. But they should come to the service with a well-trained mind, capable of acquiring, with reasonable rapidity, the special knowledge required for the service after they have entered it; and during the early years of their career their work should be so arranged as to enable them to acquire that special knowledge. We agree with the Royal Commission that young men should be taken for the consular service at an age corresponding to a definite stage in the educational system of the country, and we think that they should then, after entrance into the service, pass two or three years as probationers, partly in the Foreign Trade Department, partly as assistants to a commercial attache, and partly as vice-consuls in large consulates. In exceptional cases they might be attached to a commercial house of a kind capable of giving them the largest possible survey of the general field of trade or to a chamber ofw commerce ; but this must largely depend on the extent to which leading firms and chambers of commerce are prepared to take special trouble to train probationers with the express purpose of fitting them for their official duties. We think it advisable to retain the system of preliminary elimination of unfit candidates by the Secretary , i  State, on the advice of a board of selection, constituted on the general line.; recommended by the Royal Commission for the diplomatic service, but including a member of the consular or commercial attache service, or both.
(ii.) Consular Staffs.57. The number of officers attached to consular posts must be much increased in such a way as to leave the consul or consul-general free from all routine duties and from many reporting duties of minor consequence, in order that he may devote his time to enquiries needing initiative, leisure, and free intercourse with the local business community. This also entails that he should have time and money to travel freely in his district. Not only must the staffs of existing consulates be increased, but the number of consulates must probably also be largely augmented. z\s an instance, we may adduce the case of Italy, where it has been pointed out that the district of His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Milan, which includes the provinces of Lombardy and Venetia, contains the growing towns of Bergamo, Brescia, Como, Cremona, Mantua, Pavia, and Venice, all of which towns possess many trade possibilities, but none of which, except Venice, have a British Consular officer, while, similarly, we have no consuls in any such growing trade centres of the provinces of Turin and Emilia, as Alessandria, Cuneo, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Novara, and Bologna. Such conditions must be met, as each case may require, either by the creation of new consulates or by giving the existing consuls time and money to travel in their districts. This applies with special force to Russia and the South American Republics.58. In general we need a great increase in the consular service in those countries where trade is expanding, and is apparently responsive to the British effort. The relative value to Great Britain of the trade of a country should form some indication to the consular staff required. While the figures of exports and imports are not a complete guide, the disparities shown between the staff and the importance of the trade of a country should be examined. For example, there are in France four consuls-general, seven consuls, and sixty-five vice-consuls, with total salaries of 16.000L, and a total trade of 588 millions, of which 63 millions is with the United Kingdom. There are in the Argentine one consul-general, one consul, and sixteen vice-consuls, with total salaries of 7,800/., and a total trade of 180 millions, of which 67 millions is with the United Kingdom. There are in Brazil one consul-general, five consuls, and twenty-seven vice-consuls, with total salaries of 16,312/., and a total trade of 132 millions, of which 22 millions is with, the United Kingdom. The explanation of this discrepancy is, of course, to be found in the number of sea ports in each country and the extent of the shipping work, but it indicates the undue extent to which this consideration has dominated the distribution of consular posts.59. Such facts as these appear to indicate that a considerable reconstruction and redistribution of consular posts should be undertaken, after a careful consideration of the probable trend of British trade after the war. The question of the reduction of unsalaried posts falls for consideration here. The usual crude complaints against the existence of such posts have been effectually disposed of by the Report of the lioyal Commission, but many such posts should probably after the war be brought within the salaried service. .60. In thin connect ion we should like to recommend that, so far as it is at all compatible with the heavy burden of war work now imposed on our consulates, consuls should at once be instructed to make such tours of their districts as may be possible with a view to report on the need for increased consular representation, or, perhaps better and more feasible, that one consular officer should be deputed to take a general survey of the whole or part of various countries without confining himself to his own consular district. We have had before us a recommendation to this effect from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Rome, who urges strongly that stock should be taken of trade possibilities in Italy without delay, and that Mr. Towsey, who has been given the honorary rank of commercial attache, might be deputed to take such a general survey.61. In dealing with the increase of staffs, there are two points which should be considered, namely, the position of consular and shipping clerks respectively. The shipping work is the most wearisome and distracting of the duties laid upon the British consuls, and, taking the service as a whole, it probably occupies more time than the whole of the rest of their duties put together. This work should be almost entirely taken off their shoulders by junior vice-consuls and shipping clerks, although it must be carried on under their general authority and responsibility.(iii.) Salaries and Allowances.62. We do not feel called upon to enter into any detailed consideration of the question of emoluments, and would prefer merely to lay down that they must be
sufficient to give the consul the social position in the local business community, the leisure, and the mobility corresponding, to the duties outlined above. In a very large number of cases, better offices must be provided, and, where necessary, the consulate itself must be separated from the shipping office.63. But there is one point which we must raise, though we cannot decide it, namely, the possibility of increasing the funds at the disposal of the Foreign Office for the administration of the consular service by the institution of a general system of consular certificates of origin and consular invoices. * This is important, not only, or even chiefly, for the income derived in fees, but for the fund of otherwise inaccessible trade information which will thus be put at the disposal of the whole organisation. We would most strongly recommend that this proposal, which is now being put forward on all sides, should be carefully considered.64. We recommend that the system under which these or any fees collected by the consul are retained in whole or in part by him should be entirely reconsidered.(D.) Miscellaneous.65. There are some miscellaneous, but important, questions which remain to be considered in connection with the organisation of the commercial intelligence service abroad.(i.) Chambers of Commerce Abroad.66. British chambers of commerce in foreign countries are a most important part of the system, but at present such chambers have not in general been of much assistance in the expansion of British trade, mainly for the reason that they are largely formed by local business men who are disposed to regard the general expansion of British trade only as an encouragement of competition with themselves. Certain facts in regard to French trade may here be quoted : 67. M. Yves Guyot, French ex-Minister of Finance, says : &quot; Les chambres de commerce nationales a 1&apos;etranger peuvent rendre de grands services quand elles ont a, leur tete des hommes a large vue, qui ne considerent pas que les residents groupes autour de la chambre possedent le monopole du commerce du pays dans lequel ils se trouvent et ne regardent pas avec mefiance comme des concurrents a ecarter les compatriotes qui y viennent.&quot;68. Since 1883, thirty-six French chambers have been founded abroad, of which twenty-six are believed to be in existence to-day. They are maintained by the subscriptions of their members and by government subsidies amounting in the aggregate to 80,000 fr. a year.69. Recommendations have been made for example, by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Petrograd in favour of imitating the French example of government subsidies to chambers of commerce abroad and, as a corollary, their control in certain matters at least by the commercial attache and by His Majesty&apos;s representative. We think, however, that there are great advantages in His Majesty&apos;s representative being able to disclaim, as towards the Government to which he is accredited, any responsibility for the activities of the local chambers of commerce, and we dp not therefore favour any control by government officials over these chambers, such as might follow from the grant of government subsidies. The maintenance of such chambers of commerce is, however, an obvious advantage, and if in some countries, as most probably is the case in just those places where they are most needed and where they would be willing to furnish the most assistance to British trade, the funds of the local British community are not sufficient to maintain the chamber, it would seem necessary that some provision should be made for financial support from the United Kingdom.(ii.) Special Enquiries by Experts.70. At the present moment there is a fund for the appointment by the Board of Trade of commercial experts to report on particular subjects or countries. The fund is much smaller than that at the disposal of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce of the United States Department of Commerce, and this Bureau has consequently developed a much more extended system of special missions of this kind. We recommend that the fund for this object should be largely increased, and that experts should he freely appointed. They will be of utmost assistance to the official organisation which we have outlined in this report, and especially to the commercial attache. A regular system by which the consuls and commercial attaches, who are [477] I
not, and are not intended to be, experts, are supplemented by persons drawn from the business community who are experts is, we believe, absolutely necessary.71. We have had our attention drawn to advertising periodicals published at Berlin in Spanish by the &quot; Export Verein &quot; for Spain and Latin America, and at New York in Spanish and Portuguese for Latin America and for Portuguese East Africa. These are examples of activities very rarely indulged in by the British mercantile community, but which, we think, might with advantage be actively encouraged by the Government.I (iv.) Relation of the Organisation to the British Empire Outside the United Kingdom.72. Some efforts have been made in the past to put the commercial work of the consular service in some definite relation to the Dominions, especially Canada. These efforts will be more fruitful in proportion as some measure of unity in commercial policy is secured between the different parts of the Empire. So far as commercial intelligence is concerned, some co-ordinating authority at least is needed to advise in cases where the encouragement of exports from the Dominions to foreign countries appears likely to clash with exports from the United Kingdom. Questions of policy of the first magnitude are here involved. We can only express the hope that the organisation above outlined will be an Imperial Service contributing to the commercial prosperity of the whole Empire, and we have made our recommendations with this object in mind.(iii.)

APPENDIX I.(A.) Present Work oe the Commercial Intelligence Branch of theBoard oe Trade.1. According to the reports of the Advisory Committee on Commercial Intelli-gence, the enquiries received by the Commercial Intelligence Branch and answered from material collected from the diplomatic and consular services and the commercial attaches, as well as from the trade commissioners in the Dominions, can be classified as follows : Names of firms abroad engaged in particular lines of business in different localities ; foreign and colonial contracts open to tender and other openings for British trade; foreign and colonial tariffs and Customs regulations ; commercial statistics ; regulations concerning commercial travellers and their samples; laws affecting patents, designs, and trade marks in foreign countries ; certificates of origin ; and trade conditions (terms of payment, credit, agency conditions, means of recovery of debts, &amp;c.) in various countries.2. During the years in which the Commercial Intelligence Branch has been working, the number of enquiries received on these subjects has increased very largely. It is, however, to be noticed that, to a certain extent, such particular and separate enquiries and the answers to them should be unnecessary. Enquiries on such subjects as tariff and customs regulations, statistics, regulations concerning travellers, patent laws, certificates of origin, and trade conditions would all be more suitably dealt with by the preparation and periodical publication of manuals of standing information relating to the different countries. Such enquiries could then be answered merely by referring, in a printed letter, to the manual and page on which the information could be found. There would then remain only (1) some slight correspondence regarding the &quot; Board of Trade Journal,&quot; railway and freight rates, and incidental foreign publications not listed in the manuals of standing information ; (2) enquiries as to tenders and openings for trade, of which 767 were received by the Branch in 1912; and 3) enquiries as to names of firms abroad and various other incidental matters connected with foreign trade, which form the largest item in the correspondence, amounting to 6,320 enquiries in 1912. At present, the Branch answer the enquiries in this last category out of the unpublished lists of foreign firms prepared by the Branch. These lists are, however, of doubtful utility, if not actually misleading and dangerous, for they simply contain names with no details as to standing, volume of business, connections, references, &amp;c. There should be some indication in these lists as to the importance of individual firms ; but, in addition, attempts should be made to obtain much fuller details in the manner explained below.(B.) Standing Information.3. By standing information is understood information which, though liable to change, is yet of a more or less permanent character, such as &quot; commercial treaties, tariffs, all laws and regulations relating to commercial matters, transport and shipping arrangements, credit conditions, means of advertisement, lists of legal practitioners, information bureaux, &amp;c, &amp;c,&quot; in contra-distinction to &quot; current information,&quot; such as tenders and openings for trade, which may be of value to-day but out-of-date to-morrow. At present a great part of the information falling within the former category is either not published at all or is to be found scattered in various government publications, such as blue books, old consular reports, or the &quot; Board of Trade Journal.&quot; It is often fragmentary and out-of-date, but the main defect lies in the fact that it is not classified nor readily accessible to the general public. A [4771 K
great public need would, be met if all information on these subjects could be collected and published in a handy and compact form in the shape of a manual for each country. These compendia would be kept up-to-date by means of an annual return from the embassies and consulates. It is claimed that this method of collecting and publishing information will have the advantage of (1) making it easily accessible to all; (2) preventing a considerable amount of unnecessary correspondence between government departments, as well as with the public ; and (3) maintaining it permanently up-to-date, which, if not impossible, is very difficult under present conditions. The more important changes reported during the year would, of course, be published as usual in the &quot; Board of Trade Journal,&quot; and would then pass into the manual.(0.) Current Information.4. Current information is information of an ephemeral character, and consistB chiefly in openings for particular articles of trade and commerce. It is suggested that the best method of dealing with this is (I) to classify articles under generic headings and sub-headings; (2) to keep all such information in card index form, which admits of all obsolete information being easily weeded out; and (3) to. instruct consuls and commercial attaches to furnish all information of this nature not in despatch form, but on cards of a prescribed size, under a generic head and sub-heading thus: Generic Heading. Sub-Heading.Leather      ... ... ...   Boots and shoes.Portmanteaux. Saddlery.Electricity  ... ... ...   Machinery.Gables. Fittings.5. By this means the sum total of official knowledge on any given subject is constantly ready for reference, it can easily be duplicated in as many card catalogues as may be necessary, and much time and labour is saved by not having to register, docket, jacket, and minute papers on which there is nothing to be said and no action to be taken beyond the normal distribution to firms or chambers of commerce that may be interested.(D.) Standing op Foreign Firms.6. In view of the importance of the enquiries in regard to foreign firms, and the defects in the present system of furnishing this information, to which attention has been drawn in paragraph 2 above, it is recommended that the consuls, under the direction of the commercial attache, should undertake to send out questionnaires to all the more important and most trustworthy firms in their districts. These will contain the following questions : (1.) Name of firm ? (2.) Town and address ? (3.) Date of firm-s foundation ? (4.). Does the firm act as commission agent ? (5.) Does the firm act as buying agent ? (6.) What are the firm&apos;s usual terms of payment ? (7.) What languages does the firm correspond in ? (8.) References in the United Kingdom firms or banks. (9.) References abroad. (10.) State in detail what articles the firm deals in.(LI.)&apos; What firms does the firm already represent, foreign or British, and in what articles ?(12.) Is the firm seeking an agency ?   If so, state (a) in what article; (b) on what terms.
7. Any further particulars which the firm is willing to give concerning their capital or other particulars would, if so desired, be treated as confidential.8. Experience has shown that at least 35 to 50 per cent, of replies may be expected. The number will no doubt grow in proportion as the system is developed and found to lead to business. References to persons, firms, or banks in the United Kingdom, or the British dominions or colonies, as the case may be, are of course particularly valuable. It- is recommended that consuls should repeat this circularisation from time to time. The value of the system, however, consists essentially in proper discrimination being exercised, only firms of known reliability being selected. It would add to the value of these circulars if the consuls were to endorse the answers with their own confidential observations.9. Conversely it might be useful to obtain at this end similar information fromBritish firms for use abroad.APPENDIX II.Intelligence Reports.T. The reports to be furnished by agents abroad can conveniently be divided into three categories : (i.) Reports furnished in the ordinary course on miscellaneous subjects, (ii.) Special reports on industries and: trade, (iii.) Annual reports.2. The ordinary miscellaneous reports can be left as they are, except where susceptible of being brought under the card system explained in Appendix I.3. The special reports should, where possible, follow a lead, as explained in paragraph 42 of this Report, and, where necessary, should be drawn up by experts appointed ad hoc. These reports should be printed together for all countries by subjects, and distributed to interested parties in this country. The collected reports can be supplemented from year to year until it becomes necessary to draw up a new report.4. No consular district covers completely auy one trade or industry. The annual reports are, therefore, at best fragmentary, and are incapable of giving a comprehensive survey. For this and other reasons it is recommended that the annual consular report should not be published, but should be sent in duplicate to the commercial attache to he worked up into an annual report for the whole country. The commercial attache&quot; should send one copy home for the fuller information of the Foreign Trade Department.5. The annual report should retain its character as a summary of annual industrial, commercial, and financial development. It should not supersede or overlap the special reports. It should be stated on the first page of every report that it is intended to be a general review of the trade of the country or district during one year, and is therefore supplementary to the separate reports on special subjects issued during the year, which it should enumerate. All matter belonging more properly to the manual of standing information should be rigorously excluded. Special attention -should be paid to the following points :-(a.) Taking the industries and trades in their order of importance, a summary of the most recent developments should be furnished, and where Special Reports exist, reference should be made to them for more detailed information.   The four main noints to dwell on in these summaries are xw (i.) Competition of third nations in the country concerned;(ii.) Competition of that country itself in its own home market; (iii.) Competition of that country in British home markets ; and (iv.) Its ability to compete in third markets.C (o.) Imports and Exports should be considered in their order of importance,and commented upon more especially from the point of view of their competition with British goods.   Statistics should be furnished.
(c.) Subjects of general interest bearing on industrial and economic developments as a whole should occupy a chief place in the reports, and should be dealt with comprehensively. Such as: tariff questions; legislative measures ; labour movements; development of labour and capital organi-sation; education, technical and other; trade-unionism ; politico-eom-mercial tendencies; traffic and transport arrangements; industrial organisation (e.g., minimum wage legislation, co-operation, collective bargaining, arbitration, scientific management, profit-sharing, &amp;c), as applied to each industry rather than as general political phenomena; trusts, cartels, and syndication; banking and finance; factory laws; municipal and poor law administration ; taxation, &amp;c.6. The subjects dealt with in each annual report should follow a prescribed order for the sake of uniformitv. If there is a real demand for the information at present appearing in the annual reports, as to the growth of individual towns, including such particulars as population, telephone service, new harbour works, &amp;c, such details might appear in a summarised form in an appendix. They seem, however, to be more suitable for the manuals.7. Every five years or so it might be useful to issue a report on industrial conditions, as distinct from industrial developments, existing in the more important countries, for the purpose of comparison with those prevailing in the United Kingdom. Such reports should include a discussion of factory laws and conditions, hours of work and scale of wages, workmen&apos;s compensation and insurance, benevolent institutions, housing, cost of living, social conditions, municipal administration, trade-unions, pauperism and thrift, elementary education, technical education, and so forth. They would have to be compiled at home from material received during each quinquennial period.
mm., n .By matters concerning the Foreign Office is meant all questions concerning the ^direction and. organisation of the Commercial Attache and Consular Services and the Commercial work of officers of these services and of the diplomatic Service so far as these matters are not dealt with by the Consular or other Departments of the Foreign uff ice; and also matters concerning the personnel of the Foreign Office and of the above services who may be temporarily attached to the Department3 and any matters arising out of the work of the Department involving questions of foreign policya   All instructions issued to any officers who are under the Foreign (Jffice should be issued in the name of the Secretary of State0   On all other matters the responsibility will lie with the Board of Trade0
