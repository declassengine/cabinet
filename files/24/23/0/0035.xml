TRADE       MARKS *Explanatory Memorandum by the Board of Tradeont .....Trade Marks Bill.
TRADS MASKS BillThe proposals contained in this Bill may be briefly summarised under three heads -1- Proposals having for their object the provision o  facilities for the registration in the United kingdom of l&amp;rks which although not registrable under exist-insr legislation are nevertheless common law Marks anS could be protected in the form of action known as a &quot;passing off action&quot;.2. Proposals having for their object the prevention of the abuse of word Harks;   such abuse consisting in the use by the Trade Hark owner of his word iaark not for its proper purpose of distinguishing the goods of the Trade lark owner from the goods of othe persons, but for the purpose of giving a name to - i Article;   and thus under the protection of the Ti-^e Mark Law obtaining in fact a perpetual monopoly c. the manufacture ox the article.3, Minor amendments to the Principal Act.The existing Trade!       Act defines in Section 9 the necessary characteristics of a registrable Trade Mark, and the limitations placed by this Section on registra-tion necessarily exclude a large number of Harks which are and will continue to be actually used in Trade and Commerce.    Such Trc.de liarks so far as they in fact indi-cate a definite proprietorship would be protected by the Common Law;   and it&quot;will be a&quot; considerable advantage to the Trading Community to have these marks collected and properly classified.:    Under the proposed amendment though they will not have the special&quot;remedies accorded to Trade Marks under Section 9 of&apos;the Old Act, they will be considered as registered Marks, and the registration will be regarded as prima facie evidence of&quot;ownership. Apart from this advantage the proposal will, it is hoped facilitate registration of British Marks in foreign Countries.Most foreign countries remire as a condition of registration in their country that any person who is not a subject of their State shall as a coned lion precedent to registration prove that they have obtained registration in tljeir country of origin.Many very valuable marks which are in fact distinc-tive of a particular traderfs goods cannot at present be registered as Trade liarks in the United Kingdom, as already pointed out, and cannot therefore be registered as Trade&quot;marks by British subjects in foreign countries.In the case of many of such liarks, traders abroad have actually registered&apos;such Marks in foreigi countries as their own Trade Marks, and have used them to pass off their own goods as the goods of the British Trader;   they have even endeavoured by means of such registration to restrain the importation of British goods bearing the Harks of the true British proprietor who was responsible in the pa&amp;bfor their creation and value.
In Clauses 1 to 6 of the Bill an attempt has&quot; &quot;beenmade to frame a complete scheme for the registration of such common law Trade Marks.Clause 1 provides that for this purpose a new part of the Trade li-ark Register, to be known as part B, shall be opened wherein such Marks shall be registered.Clause 2 provides for the registration of all such Marks which have been bona fide used in the United Kingdom for a period of not less than three years.   It is not intended that the Patent Office should undertake any search in respect of these Marks, but power is reserved to refuse-registration to any Mark which in the opinion of the Eegis-trar should not be registered,  in appeal is provided from the Registrar!s decision to the Court.Qlause 3 applies certain provisions of the principal Act to the Marks registrable under this Act.   These provi-sions are necessary to provide machinery for opposition and other proceedings before the Patent Office *Clause 4 provides that the entry of a Mark in part B of the Begister shall not be conclusive evidence that the owner has the exclusive right to the use of the Mark but only prima facie evidence, and the only powers tiiat the owner of such a Mark will have in the United Kingdom will be such powers as he would have had in apassing off action, except that the onus of proving that the Mark has not been infringed has been placed upon the defendant.Clause 5 makes it an offence to use the word &quot;registered&quot; in connection with Marks registered in part B of the Register unless at the same time it is clearly indicated that the Mark is registered in part B.   This is necessary in order that the public may not be misled.Clause 6 allows the Registrar when he is considering an application to register a Mark under part A of the Register and is of opinion that such application should be refused, instead of absolutely refusing to register the Mark under part A of the Register, to treat it as an application under part B ana proceed accordingly.These clauses will in the opinion of the Board of Tra^e enable British Trade Mark owners to obtain protection for their Marks in foreign countries and will at the same time be a more or less complete record of Marks in use in the United Kingdom.  As regards common law Marks so registered in part B substantially no greater rights in the United Kingdom will be acquired by registration than are at present capable of oeing enforced in a passing bxi action.Clause 7is framed with thed)ject of remedying the abuse of the Trade Mark law referred to under the Second head above.
The proper function of a Trade Mark is to indicate that the goods upon which it is used are the goods of a certain Trader by virtue of manufacture, Selection, Sale cc.    The name by which an article is commonly known - without any reference to its origin - is not a proper registrable Trade Mark; and the Courts have on many occasions removed such rnafrks trozi the Begister.    The evils resulting from the possession of any mono-poly in the name of an article, have been most conspicuous in the case of drugs, and in particular drugs which were originally protected by a patent/   It is a well known principle of law that; the name of a patented Article cannot be protected^as a Trade Mark.    Otherwise the rights of the public to manufacture the article after fourteen years might be practically destroyed, if they were unable to use the name by&apos;which alone the patented article has been known and sold,    A very good example of this abuse is the word &quot;Aspirin&quot;.   This word was registered as a Trade Mark for a drug.    The owners of the Mark instead of.using the word legitimately as a Trade Mark, viz, as indicating a drug of the manufacture of a particular firm, have consistentlv sought to use the word as the name of the article, and under the garb of a Trade dark, to obtain in fact a perDetual monopoly of the manufacture of the article,Although the law as laid down in decided decisions is fairly clear, the evil has continued., because of the.difficulty and expense of removing a Mark when once on the Register; and in many cases it is no one persons interest or province to undertake the task.   It is proposed therefore to define more clearly the right of removal in such cases, and to provide a simple remedy.   By clause 7 the Courts or the Registrar if the applicant chooses to apply to the Registrar in the first instance are to have the power of removing such marks from the Begister.It is recognised that there are many 7/ord Marks at present in use and registered as Trade Marks which if at once removed from the Begister would cause great loss to the owners and would cause considerable injustice.     A period within such the Trade Mark owner may amend his ways and make his use of the Trade Mark a legitimate use has, therefore been allowed.(3)       Clause 8. transfers the right of appeal in matters which involve legal interpretation of the Acts&quot; from the Soard of Trade to the Court.    Under the present law there is in &quot;the case of oppositions and other matters a dual jurisdiction on apoeal which has obvious disadvantages.    It is thought that all such appeals should be made to the Court, except appeals on unopposed appli-cations.    It further gives the CourtLpower to exercise the same discretion in dealing with cases as is now exercised by the Regis-trar.    Dissatisfaction has been caused in recent years by the fact that on appeal from the Registrar the Court has in certain cases avoided a direct decision on the merits, and has rejected appeals on the ground that the Registrar has exercised a discretion which should not be interfered with.   It seems better to give the Court the fullest power of revision and appeal.
Q^3 &amp;L2 gives to the Registrar an original Juris-diction to rectify the Register which he has not hitherto enjoyed, but which it is thought is desirable.    This will enable any Marks which have ceased to be used to be removed from the Register.    Many such marks remain on the Register at present, owing to the unwillingness of traders to incur the expense of applying to the Court to remove them.Clause 10 remedies a defect of the 1905 Act which does not give the Registrar the power which he should have to deal with the costs of all proceedings before him.Clause. 11 makes it compulsory to register all assignments oT Trade Marks.    A similar clause appears in the Patents and Designs Bill.    It is just as essen-tial that the public should be informed oi the true owner of a trade mark as it is that they should know the real proprietor of a patent or design.
