CONFIDENTIAL LIBRA!,.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for, the Cabinet.   November 1925,CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 459 (25).CABINET.BRITISH MONETARY POLICY.Note by the  Chancellor of  the Exchequer.MY colleagues will, I think, be interested to see the attached article, reprinted from the &quot;Manchester Guardian,&quot; Commercial Supplement, in regard to the views of Mr. Keynes concerning monetary policy.W. S. c.Treasury Chambers, November 9, 1925.Extract from the &quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot; Commercial Supplement,October 29, 1925.The Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes. A Policy leading to Protection and Inflation. (By our City Editor.)THE contribution towards the solution of present-day politico-economic problems which have in recent months flowed from the facile pen and tongue of Mr. J. M. Keynes have in the main been critical and destructive. That is inevitable in view of the rejection of Mr. Keynes&apos;s own plan for our economic amelioration. The fact, nevertheless, serves to remind us that Mr. Keynes&apos;s constructive proposals still stand as an alternative system to that which has in fact been adopted  namely, the restoration of our currency to the gold standard and the return more or less to the pre-war financial and commercial methods; and it suggests that this alternative system ought also to be subjected to critical counting. Accordingly, an attempt is made here made, it may be admitted, with some trepidation, for he who would attempt to do unto Mr. Keynes what Mr. Keynes has done to others begins his task under a severe handicap&apos; to examine Mr. Keynes&apos;s policy as a whole and to see in which direction it would lead us.The main planks in Mr. Keynes&apos;s economic platform are three : 1. Monetary reform;2. Discouragement of foreign investment; 3. Encouragement of home investment;and the comment which follows may conveniently observe the same classification. The superstructure of his platform, it need hardly be said, has been cunningly assembled into a solid and stable whole, though whether the stability extends to its-supports and foundations is a matter for enquiry.I.-Monetary Reform.Mr. Keynes&apos;s scheme for a reformed currency system is expounded at length in his brilliant &quot; Tract on Monetary Reform,&quot; published in the autumn of 1923.   It is obvious that we cannot pretend in an article of this length to give an adequate [13796] -
presentation of Mr. Keynes&apos;s arguments and conclusions, but we propose to refer briefly to some of the salient points of his scheme. What he proposed was, shortly, the abandonment by this country of the gold standard currency, and its substitution by an inconvertible paper currency, &quot; managed &quot; so as to retain the general index of commodity prices at a current level. The &quot; management &quot; is to consist of the employment of various expedients the use of the Bank rate, the buying or selling of securities by the Bank of England, the lending policy of the Bank of England, the regulation of the supply of Treasury bills, and so on in order to expand or contract, as occasion arose, the corpus of purchasing power, cash and credit, available for financing the interchange of goods and services.Theoretically the system is clearly a possible one, but in its practical application it is open to criticism on at least three important points :  (a.) It is based, in the first place, on the &quot;quantity theory &quot; that the general level of prices is completely determinable by the volume of goods and services changing hands, the amount of money in circulation, and the average &quot; velocity of circulation &quot; of each unit of money. Mr. Keynes&apos;s system assumes that it is possible to correct variations in the &quot; velocity of circulation &apos;&apos; by compensating variations in the supply of cash and credit. If, for example, the circulation of money is unduly sluggish and commodity prices are falling it assumes that that sluggishness can be corrected by lower interest rates, increased lending on the part of the banks, or the purchase of securities by the Bank of England. The assumption is, however, only tenable theoretically on the hypothesis that the variations in the volume of money circulating and its velocity of circulation are completely independent. If these two quantities are not independent, but are functions of some third variable, it may be theoretically impossible to preserve their product at a fixed value. In less technical language, in a period of profound business pessimism it may be impossible to stimulate trade by increasing the quantity of credit, because the additional credit will merely lie idle, will, in fact, possess no velocity of circulation, so that the effect of the increase will merely be negatived by a decline in the average velocity of circula-tion. It may well be, therefore, that the managed currency, whatever its apparent attractions, may in practice have no advantages from the point of view of price stability (except over a long period) over the gold standard.(&amp;.) It is a further defect of Mr. Keynes&apos;s plan that he is unable to define with precision the measure of prices which he proposes to adopt as his new standard. The &quot; Tract on Monetary Reform &quot; provides very little information on that point, but one would infer from it that it was on an index of wholesale commodity prices, such as the Board of Trade index number, that he proposed to confer the attribute of immutability. But in his later writings Mr. Keynes appears to lose his respect for the wholesale price index number, and to have hankerings after an index of a much more complex character, in which the prices of different classes of goods, ranging from raw materials to finished products, shall be taken into account. But, worse still, one is after all left wondering if Mr. Keynes really wants stability of prices when one reads at the end of the &quot; Tract on Monetary Reform &quot; the following passage defining the principles upon which the central monetary authority should act:  &quot; Actual price movements must, of course, provide the most important datum; but the state of employment, the volume of production, the effective demand for credit as felt by the banks, the rate of interest on investments of various types, the volume of new issues, the flow of cash into circulation, the statistics of foreign trade, and the level of the exchanges must all be taken into account. The main point is that the objective of the authorities, pursued with such means as are at their command, should be the stability of prices.&quot;Is there not here much scope for &quot; sensible&quot; variations upon the &quot;strait-laced&quot; theme of stability ?(c.) But by far the most serious weakness of Mr. Keynes&apos;s plan is the fact that it involves the momentary separation of this country from the rest of the world. There was never any chance of other countries joining Great Britain in an adventure into &quot;isometry.&quot; The experiences of the European countries of &quot;management&quot; had been too calamitous to tempt them to further experiment in the system, and neither the British Dominions, which own the unmined gold of the world, or the United States, the mortgagees in possession of half the mined stock, showed the slightest disposition to cry stinking fish. Mr. Keynes, indeed, did not shirk the issue.   He agreed that our adoption of the stable price system would involve the
disadvantage of an unstable exchange with the gold standard &quot;If ... .the external price level lies outside our control we must submit either to our own internal price level or to our exchange being pulled about by external influences. If the external price level is unstable, we cannot keep both our own price level and our exchanges stable. And we are compelled to choose.&quot; He goes on to say that the rioht choice is not necessarily the same for all countries; that it must depend partly on the relative importance to a country of external and internal trade, but that, nevertheless, there seems to be in almost every case a presumption in favour of stability of prices, for &apos;&apos; stability of exchange is the nature of a convenience which adds to the efficiency and prosperity of those who are engaged in foreign trade.&quot;There seems to be an almost incredible levity about this reasoning. If the choice between price stability and exchange stability is &quot;not necessarily the same&quot; for all countries, for which country should it be exchange stabibhVy if not for our own, with its almost unique proportion of external trade ? One wonders, indeed, if Mr. Keynes has not since been tempted to repent of his deliberate choice, for in recent months he has expressed the gravest concern at the overvaluation of sterling in terms of other currencies. Is it part of Mr. Keynes&apos;s case that the &quot;pulling about&quot; of the exchanges between our &quot;managed currency&quot; island and the external gold standard would never be so violent as to bring them out of adjustment with the purchasing power parity ? If not and it would require some boldness to assert positively that as between two entirely different monetary systems there must always be immediate exchange adjustment he must be prepared to face the recurrence of the state of affairs which he now condemns so whole-heartedly.II. Foreign Investment.However, the fact that he has made his choice in favour of price stability has an important bearing on the subsequent evolution of Mr. Keynes&apos;s economic thinking. His acceptance of the principle of monetary isolation leads him on to the advocacy of measures which would involve as their logical outcome the deliberate adoption by this country of a policy of economic autonomy, a revolution of our industrial system and the sacrifice of our natural advantages, not because these things are forced upon us, as, indeed, they may be from outside, but for the nebulous and hazardous advantage of a scientific monetary system.   The first of these measures is the imposition of restrictions on the traditional practice pursued by British investors of investing a large proportion of their savings in overseas countries.   To this subject of foreign investment Mr. Keynes devoted his address to the Liberal Summer School at Oxford in August 1924.  In that address he recognised the national advantage of the large-scale export of capital in the past.   But he questioned the wisdom of con-tinuing the practice on an unrestricted scale, for he doubted whether the present organisation of investment was calculated either to protect the self-interest of the investor or, taking the community as a whole, to yield an equal return to that w&apos;hich might be derived from diverting the capital exported to home investment.   His criticism was directed, in particular, to the stimulation of investment in the British Dominions afforded by the Trustee Acts, which enable the Dominions to borrow on far more favourable terms than they would obtain under free market conditions.   For the Trustee Acts there can, in truth, be no economic justification, but Mr. Keynes would not be content with the repeal or amendment of these Acts. He&apos;sees no justifi-cation for foreign investment in general, on the ground that it stimulates exports. There is no special virtue in exports which are not required to pay for necessary-imports.   The desire to get rid of goods out of the country is not &quot; sensible.&quot;   It stimulates employment, but it does not stimulate employment one whit more than does a real investment at home.  The argument, it would appear, is defective, in that it assumes that the advantage to be gained from a foreign investment is limited to the employment of British workers and profits to British capital resulting from the actual export of goods representing the investment.   Are  there no   secondary advantages to be gained in cheaper supplies of raw material or an enhanced demand tor our manufactures from the development by British capital of backward countries ? Are not considerations of  increasing and diminishing returns relevant to the determination of the relative advantages of investing capital at home or abroad? Ann again, assuming the end which Mr. Keynes seeks to be desirable, is there not a simpler means of attaining it than the plan of a &quot;managed &quot; investment policy which Mr. Keynes appears to favour? &apos;
III. Home Investment and Unemployment.We defer suggesting the answer to this last question, if it has not already suggested itself to the reader, in order first to refer to Mr. Keynes&apos;s crowning discovery, a &quot;drastic remedy for unemployment.&quot; Mr. Keynes&apos;s drastic remedy, which is the corollary to his antipathy to foreign investment, is (like all great discoveries) essentially simple. It consists in suspending the redemption of National Debt and devoting the sinking fund, &quot;not to redeem old debt, with the result of driving the national savings to find a foreign outlet, but to replacing unproductive debt by productive debt.&quot; The Government is to mobilise scientists, inventors, engineers and architects to tell how it can most profitably spend  100 millions a year on capital works, and the resulting stimulus is to initiate a national movement of &quot; cumulative prosperity,&quot; for Mr. Keynes, more fortunate than the brewers of herb beer, claims to have invented a medicine which is both stimulating and wholesome. Business has grown timid; it must be jolted out of the rut in which it has stuck; it requires to dislodge it the kind of stimulus which the rebuilding of the devastated areas, &quot; independently of its inflationary features &quot; (our italics), has given to France.The heady liquors, Protection and Inflation, which are the obvious means to his end, Mr. Keynes rejects with scorn, for they yield but false hopes and promises. He offers instead an elixir from which the intoxicating elements have been carefully distilled, the elixir of &quot;monetary reform, which will remove fear, and .... the diversion of the national savings from relatively barren foreign investment into State-encouraged constructive enterprises at home, which will inspire confidence.&quot; We wonder whether the essence thus refined could justify these ambitious claims. We wonder whether in eliminating the injurious substances Mr. Keynes has not eradicated the virtues as well. And still more do we wonder that Mr. Keynes can so easily persuade himself to overlook the vestiges of active disease, which must surely be treated before the most perfect tonic can be administered with benefit.Verbally, Mr. Keynes admits that there are defects in our economic system which are not purely functions of monetary policy. He admits that immobility of labour as between industries, trade union restrictions, and the disparity of wages as between sheltered and unsheltered industries are serious obstacles to economic prosperity. But he never faces the full implication of his admissions. These are immobile rocks which.must be &quot;submerged in a rising sea&quot; the very language savours of inflation. We must not force labour out of what is depressed, but attract it into what is prosperous; not reduce wages where they are high, but raise them where they are low. Yet how are these things to be done except under a regime of continuously rising prices? And under a regime of continuously rising prices what prospect is there that they will happen, seeing that all experience points to the con-clusion that it is precisely a rising general price index number which accentuates dispersion of individual commodity prices and maladjustment of wage rates in different industries ? And why, if at all costs the process of attacking the rocks with hammer and chisel is to be eschewed, multiply the rocks by gratuitously forcing our industry into channels in which the rocks are to be found, into channels which, when allowed its natural flow, it has always avoided? Are the fundamental adjustments going to be more easily effected or more easily evaded if our great export industries, the natural growth of our climate and mineral wealth, are to be deliberately hampered and discouraged ?The economic consequences of Mr. Keynes, the natural and humanly probable consequences, are, we suggest, Protection and Inflation Protection because that is, if not the only, the simple and popular means to the attainment of his object of financial and industrial self-sufficiency; Inflation, because his exaggerated faith in the power of monetary manipulation (coupled with his almost morbid aversion to the rougher methods of economic adjustment) must inevitably lead to its abuse. Mr. Keynes will repudiate this conclusion, and, so far as his own conscious intentions are concerned, we accept his repudiation in advance. But he who wills the end cannot complain if the means employed to attain it are cruder and more obvious than he himself would have used.o
