Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1925.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 431 (25).CABINET.MOSUL.Note by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE enclosed extract from a private letter sent on the 5th October by Reuter&apos;s correspondent in Constantinople to his Chief, Sir Roderick Jones, may be of interest to mv colleagues. Sir Roderick informs me that his correspondent has lived in Constantinople for twenty years and knows the Turks as few Englishmen do..October 16, 1925.(Confidential.)I have not. sent very much about the Mosul question beyond brief summaries of comments in the principal organs of the press. But the question may take a serious turn, and I hope our Government have fully weighed the consequences of persisting in a firm attitude. If we are really prepared for all contingencies, even hostilities, well and good ; we really have very little to fear from war with Turkey, and it would probably mean the end of Kemalism. But if we are going to back down at the last moment, if we are simply bluffing and not ready to back our word with the sword,, then Heaven help our .prestige. We are dealing with a clever, unscrupulous and desperate opponent. The Turk to-day is swollen with vanity and bursting with pride. He has not had a single check since the armistice of Mudania. He has trampled on the corns of all the Powers, has flouted their representatives and played ducks and drakes with their interests.   Nobody has dared say him nay.Everybody feels the humiliation of this attitude. Everybody is longing to see the Turk put in his proper place. But nobody is at present prepared to face the effort which might be entailed. Only in the matter of Mosul has he been thwarted. Our attitude has been straightforward, dignified and firm. , But are we going to continue it in face of the violent opposition our policy is meeting in certain quarters at home. You, Sir, are better able to form an opinion on that subject. I will just state some facts with regard to the position out here.The Ghazi is at hearta patriot. He has big schemes of reform in mind, and is setting about their realisation with an energy and ruthlessness that have often defeated their own ends. He must realise that all his ambitious projects would suffer a severe set-hack in the event of a conflict with Great Britain ; that in the event of war, the covert opposition which is smouldering in every part of the country might prove a serious factor to be reckoned with ; that the Kurdish movement, insignificant though it was, strained and crippled the resources of Government for months ; that a large majority of Kurds are only cowed and not subjugated, and might prove a source of danger if things went at all wrong; that Greece might have something to say, owing to the merciless persecution of all Greek elements remaining in Turkey.If the Ghazi seriously faced these facts there could he no question of a conflict, and he could check the agitation in press and party by merely raising his finger. But there are one or two considerations which upset any calculations based upon logic and reason. In the first place, the Ghazi is surrounded by a crowd of self-seeking sycophants, who are unable to take a statesmanlike view of any question.   All theL. S. A.[13688]
serious elements who served Mustafa Kemal and helped to build his reputation have Keen gradually&apos; driven (terven into opposition or obscurity. The only outstanding figure who remained Ismet is said to have lost the Ghazi&apos;s confidence since the latter&apos;s divorce from Latife Hanoum. Certainly Latife and Ismet were great friends, and since her departure Ismet has been very much in the background. The next Cabinet crisis will probably see his retirement. The Tewfik Rushdis, Shukri Kayas, Kedjebs, &amp;c, are all more or less nonentities who owe their position to entire subser-vience to the Ghazi.   They flatter where Ismet and men like Reouf would advise.Then there is the undoubted influence of. Moscow in Angora, especially upon Tewfik Rushdi. If Russian; can embioil things it will be all so much to her good. But I very much doubt if the Turks will be able to count on any active assistance from Russia, except in the matter of munitions and propaganda.Thirdly, there is the army. There is a new generation growing up whose memory does not extend beyond the defeats inflicted upon the Greeks, who were backed by all the might of England! They think their army is a match for any army in the world, and they would not mind putting their faith to the test-especially as they feel that our means of defence in Mosul are as insignificant as our means of offence elsewhere.Still, in spite of these considerations, I feel that the chances are against an actual breach over Mosul. Our friends the French are watching with very anxious eyes, as they feel that trouble in Mesopotamia would inevitably be followed by complications on the Syrian frontier. I had a talk with Colonel May, who is here on the Turko-Syrian Boundary Commission.   He says the Turks are &quot; impossible.&quot;
