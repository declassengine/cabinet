[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]      ^ 3 *Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No. &quot;]dCP. 472 (25).CABINET.IRAQ AND THE MOSUL QUESTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THERE are three main questions which have to be considered before the Cabinet can be in a position to come to a definite conclusion as to the line which the British representatives should take when the question of the Iraq frontier comes back to the Council of the League of Nations in December. The first is whether the general policy Which has governed our position in Iraq under successive Governments still holds good. The second is whether the retention of the present frontier is essential to the success of that policy. The third is the bearing of the particular issue of the Iraq frontier upon our general policy of encouraging resort to arbitration and strengthening the authority of the League of Nations.The main principles upon which the British political position in Iraq is based were laid down by Mr. Churchill at the Cairo Conference in April 1921 and approved by the Cabinet of the day. An autonomous Iraq State was set up under its own monarch and with representative institutions, conducting its own affairs, hut subject, in return for British support and protection, to the obligation to accept the advice of the British High Commissioner on important issues of policy. The conditions of this special relationship were embodied in a Treaty of Alliance, with special Military, Financial and other Agreements, which superseded the Mandatory position as between ourselves and Iraq, and was accepted by the League of Nations as fulfilling our mandatory responsibilities towards that body. This treaty, which was to have effect for twenty years, was signed on the 10th October, 1922.Meanwhile, the collapse of the Greek Army in Asia Minor and the obviously aggressive attitude of the victorious Turks, who had announced their intention of recovering Mosul Province for Turkey, created a new and menacing situation.   So serious was the view taken of the state of affairs at that time that Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s Government decided to reconsider the whole question of our position in Iraq ab initio, in order to see whether a complete abandonment of our responsibilities might not be preferable to the danger and expense which it was feared might be involved in maintaining them.    The matter was exhaustively reviewed by a strong Cabinet Committee, which came definitely to the conclusion that an immediate withdrawal, involving, as it certainly would, the downfall of the Kingdom of Iraq, was out of the question.   Such a withdrawal would, in their opinion, be,regarded as a breach of faith towards Iraq, which would inflict irreparable damage on British honour and prestige throughout the East, as well as a breach of faith towards the League of Nations.   It would carry with it consequences of a far-reaching character, including the loss not only of Mosul but of Baghdad, probably even of Basra, which would be as difficult and costly to defend as an intact Iraq State.   The Committee, after pointing out the danger involved to our oil supplies, and quoting the considered opinion of the Foreign and Colonial Offices that the return of the Turks to Iraq would be the inevitable prelude to an agitation which would not cease until Syria and Palestine had experienced a similar fate, concluded the case against the policy of immediate withdrawal as follows : &quot; If this were the case, Britain would have fought the Asiatic War in vain. Turkey would have been the victor, not in Europe alone, but in Asia also, and her triumph would not be a mere reversion to the status quo ante, but would plant an aggressive Islamic State in a central site, where it would be in a position[13808]B
to control the future of the Middle East, with results to British interests in those regions, and even in India, that might well in the long run be disastrous.&quot;Having thus dismissed the policy of allowing the collapse of the Iraq State, the Committee considered the question how soon the financial and military commitments we had undertaken could be honourably and safely brought to an end. The Military and Financial. Agreements attached to the Treaty expressly stipulated that Iraq should &quot; at the earliest possible date, accept full responsibility both for the main-tenance of internal order and for the defence of Iraq from external aggression.&quot; But no definite date, within the twenty years&apos; currency of the Treaty, had been laid down for the attainment of this essential condition. To remove the &quot; not unnatural apprehension &apos;&apos; aroused by the prospect of so indefinite a commitment, the Committee recommended that the Treaty, whose ratification it considered could not honourably be withheld, should be supplemented by a Protocol terminating the Treaty within a stated period, and providing for its possible replacement by some other arrange-ment. The stated period was laid down as at longest four years from the ratification of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey. It may be added &quot;that it was reasonable to assume at that date (March 1923) that the Treaty of Peace would have definitely settled the frontier question indeed, it was on account of the frontier question that the ratification of the Treaty of Peace was naturally taken as the starting point. That this period was not intended to mark the end of the special relationship between Great Britain and Iraq was made clear in the actual Protocol, which expressly laid down that negotiations for the new Treaty should be initiated before the end of the four years. The character of the future agreement was indicated by the Committee as one &quot;which may admit of British assistance being given to the Arab State, at no cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government, with a view to the development of its resources and the stability of its administration. In such an arrangement special provision for the maintenance of British interests, including those relating to the port of Basrah and facilities to Imperial air routes, may profitably be included. Should these expectations be realised it may yet be that Iraq will constitute a stable factor in the group of. British interests in the East, without either imposing a burden upon the British Exchequer or. entailing military liabilities which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be unwilling to assume.&quot;When I visited Iraq in April I was able to assure myself that the policy thus laid down was working successfully. Relations between the Iraq Government and its British advisers were excellent. Military expenditure had been drastically reduced, and only the uncertainty as to the frontier stood,in the way of substantial further reductions towards the goal contemplated in 1923 of a cessation of British expenditure on Iraq for Iraq purposes by the end of the first Treaty period. I found, however, and reported to the Cabinet (CP. 235 (25)), the conviction universally expressed that it was essential for the stability and prosperous development of the country that we should make it clear, as soon as possible, that we did definitely intend to replace; the present Treaty by one framed on lines more suited to permanent co-operation, both from the point of view of Iraq and from that of, the British Govern-ment and British taxpayer. I defined my conception of the general character of such a treaty in terms in no way inconsistent with the policy indicated in the 1923 Report, though in somewhat greater detail : 1     , ...&quot;Such a new treaty ought not to involve-at any rate, not after a brief initial period any further expenditure on Iraq for Iraq purposes. It ought certainly to reserve to the British Government the right to maintain forces, and that means primarily, and probably exclusively, air forces, in Iraq at whatever strength it may consider desirable on general grounds of Imperial strategy, and to receive some contribution from Iraq for any portion of those forces which may be asked to do purely Irao, work. It ought to secure a sufficient measure of control to the High Commissioner to enable him to safeguard the interests of Kurdish, Assyrian and other minorities, as well as to ensure that the general administration of public affairs should continue to be such as to afford reasonable protection to foreign commerce and investment.&quot;When the League Commission^ report was made public at the end of July, i pointed out (CP. 385. (25)) that the stipulations made by. the Commissioners with, regard to the continuance of the mandate did not in effect amount to anything more than an immediate declaration of the policy which we should have folloyved in any case.   The alternative to such a declaration would mean the reversal of our whole
policy and the sacrifice not only of our reputation for constancy and honour, but of the whole great commercial, political and strategic position which we had built up and of which we should soon begin to reap the positive advantages. This view commended itself to the Cabinet, and I was accordingly authorised to give the necessary declaration to the Council of the League, which I did, as far as possible, in the actual language of the Cabinet minute. I made it clear that I did not consider that anything like so long a period as twenty-five years would be required to create the condition of assured stability postulated by the Commission, nor was there anything stated to the League of Nations inconsistent with our declared policy of making Iraq stand on its own feet at the end of the first treaty period. As far as our relationship to Iraq is concerned, there has thus been no departure from the general principles of policy laid down by the Cabinet Committee in 1923. The only difference lies in the fact that we have now made the carrying out of that policy by the implementing of the Protocol to the Anglo-Iraq Treaty the subject of a definite under-taking given to the League of Nations. \wWhat other policy is possible for us ? If we could disavow our assurance to the League of Nations, as technically we might do in the event of an adverse verdict on the frontier question, what would be the advantage 1 Any course which we might take which involved the collapse of the Iraq State, whether as the result of a sudden military withdrawal or of a breach of our obligation to sustain to the best of our ability before the League the claim of Iraq to the integrity of its territory, would be open to-day to every objection conclusively urged against it by the Cabinet Committee in 1923. On the other hand, the policy initiated in 1921, and not fundamentally varied since, of helping Iraq to undertake the full military and financial responsibility for its internal and external security at the earliest possible moment, and of placing our subsequent permanent relations with Iraq on a footing which will continue our co-operation and retain our influence without involving a burden on the British taxpayer, has already achieved substantial results, and is steadily nearing accomplishment. The internal difficulties which still bulked large in 1921 and 1923 have disappeared. The only serious problem still to be disposed of is that of the frontier.The essential fact to keep in view about the present frontier between Iraq and Turkey is that it is substantially a natural frontier, and would, indeed, be a perfect natural frontier if carried a few miles further north, as we have urged, to the actual summit crest of the main mountain range. High mountains close it in completely along its whole extent except for a gap of about 25 miles on the north-west, which constitutes the only possible gateway for a serious invasion. Such a frontier requires a very small force for its defence on either side, and automatically tends to prevent any competition in armaments. An)^ frontier further to the south would sacrifice this natural advantage and impose on Iraq a much more difficult and costly defensive problem. The present frontier is also the natural economic frontier. Mosul is the natural local mart and entrepot of all the region to the north of it up to the main range, and almost all its trade, both import and export, is, and always has been, with Baghdad and the rest of Iraq, and not with Asia Minor, or even Syria.Lastly, it is also the natural ethnic frontier, or at any rate as good a one as can be devised. The Arab element extends close up to it and the gap between it and the frontier on the north-west and north is filled up by Yezidi and Christian tribes, who^ are at any rate not more alien to the Arabs than to the Turks in race and traditions,, and certainly no less hostile to Turkish rule. On the other hand, the Turkish population stops short of the frontier on the north. The scattered Turkoman settle-ments in the Mosul Vilayet, numbering some five per cent, of the total population,, are mostly in the south-east of the vilayet and far away from the frontier. The only ethnic element which crosses the frontier are the Kurds, who inhabit the north-eastern mountainous part of the vilayet and constitute an actual majority of its population and nearly a sixth of the whole population of Iraq. The idea of a Kurdish national State, including the Kurds of Turkey, Iraq and Persia, as a kind of Asiatic Switzerland may be theoretically attractive, and was toyed with at the time of the Treaty of Sevres. But it is not a practical possibility, and apart from it there is no reason either of sentiment or of material interest which would justify any transfer of the Kurds of Iraq from a State where they are content and enjoy a considerable measure of autonomy and special consideration, to Turkey, where their religious and national interests would bring them into direct collusion with the fanatically Turkicising and anti-religious policy of Angora.Iraq, within its present frontiers, is, indeed, a natural geographic, defensive,[13808] b 2
economic and political unit, and that fact has been the basis upon which we and the Allies have acted ever, since the war. At the Armistice we immediately, in accordance with its terms, occupied the territory up to the present frontier, but made no attempt to push beyond it. That frontier was accepted by the Turkish Government in the Treaty of Sevres, signed in August 1920, in which &quot; Mesopotamia,&quot; up to that frontier was referred to as a unit to be dealt with under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League. . The draft Mandate submitted to the Council of the League was based on the same assumption of the unity of the country. No suggestion that there was any difference between the Iraq districts comprised in the old Mosul vilayet and the rest of Iraq was ever made when King Feisal was elected, or when the Iraq Constituent Assembly framed the existing constitution of the country.The Turkish claim, which was not officially brought before the Allied Powers until the Lausanne Peace Conference four years after the final disappearance of Turkish rule from Iraq, is based on the National Pact passed in January 1925 by the Angora meeting of deputies from which the present Turkish Government sprang. That Pact declared that any parts of the Turkish Empire which were &quot; inhabited by an Ottoman Moslem majority, united in religion, race and aims, formed a whole which did not admit of division.&quot; It is possible that at the time the Turkish deputies who drew up the terms of the Pact genuinely believed that there was a large Turkish population both in the town of Mosul and in the province. The argument in the course of the Lausanne discussions was largely that the Kurds and Turks were essentially one, if not in race, at any rate in outlook, and political sentiment. Whatever element of genuine belief was behind that argument in 1923, it certainly is no longer a motive with the Turks to-day. Since the recent Kurdish insurrection, the main motive of the Turks in trying to secure the Mosul vilayet has been the fear that the measure of encouragement given to Kurdish nationalism under Iraq rule might render the suppression of that nationalism in Turkish Kurdistan more difficult. Apart from that, the only other possible motive is one of military and political strategy. In a military sense Mosul would dominate Baghdad. In a political sense it would give the Turks, through its Arab population, a lever to work on both Iraq and Syria. It would be the key to a possible reconquest, or at any rate a reassertion of hegemony over the Arab world.It will be seen that the Turkish case is not based on economic or defensive necessity or upon any sentimental reason which could keep national feeling alive, but only on motives of policy or ambition, which are not likely to lead Turkey to go to extremes in pressing her claim if she knows that she will encounter determined resistance, and which are not really consistent with Mustafa KemaLs main conception of developing Turkey as a purely national state. It is sometimes suggested that Mosul, denied to the Turks, will always be another Alsace-Lorraine, preventing any real co-operation with Turkey in future and always exposing a vulnerable point to attack. That is to misconceive both the Turkish character and the actual situation. The former was well summed up by an acute observer, Colonel Leake, nearly a century ago :  &quot; The Turks are a people seldom diverted from their purpose but by fear, but it is equally in their character to submit when they are conscious that what is actually done cannot be reversed, though it might be a most arduous task to obtain their previous concurrence in the same measure.&quot;As regards the situation itself, the essence of it lies in the fact that the present frontier is one of natural equilibrium and stability, and that any change will only mark the beginning of a period of increasing unrest and instability. With the present frontier once settled in our favour we can go ahead with the natural development of our policy in Iraq. If the,frontier question is settled against us, and Iraq is compelled, with shrunken resources in revenue and population, to sustain an infinitely more difficult defence our whole policy will have received a grave setback. The hope of seeing Iraq standing on its own feet will have been seriously, perhaps indefinitely, postponed,, while evacuation would be no less difficult and no less disastrous than it would be to-day. Our difficulties would be enormously increased if it were felt in Iraq that the dismemberment of the country had been due not to the adverse verdict of the League in spite of our efforts, but to weakness or deliberate ill-faith on our part.We are, therefore, vitally interested in the maintenance of the present frontier as a matter directly affecting the success of our policy of setting Iraq on its feet and
enabling us to free ourselves from the financial and military burden which its occupation at present involves. In any case, we are deeply committed by our whole policy in the past to doing our best to maintain that frontier. Throughout the whole period in which we set up the Kingdom of Iraq and negotiated our treaty of alliance with it, it was as an undivided State and with no suggestion that we could conceivably go back on the attitude we were taking up with regard to its frontier at Lausanne. In view of doubts which had apparently been created on this point by an answer in Parliament, Mr. Thomas, on the 28th July, 1924, directly instructed the High Commissioner to make it public that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no intention whatever of abandoning their support of the frontier claim which had just been brought forward on behalf of Iraq at Constantinople. When we further take into account the whole series of successive earlier pledges to the various elements of the population of Iraq, and in particular the special responsibility which we cannot ignore for the Christian population of the northern districts, it is clear that honour and interest alike preclude any other policy than that of defending the integrity of Iraq to whatever extent is compatible with our undertaking to submit the frontier question to the League.It has, indeed, been suggested that even if we are honourably bound to support Iraq diplomatically, we are in no way committed to defend its territory against military aggression. Even if there were no specific obligations, it is inconceivable that we could afford to tolerate direct aggression upon a State for whose welfare we are responsible to the League of Nations, whose administration, military and civil, we control, and whose foreign policy, above all, we should have conducted up to the point at which that foreign policy has led up to war. We are, however, definitely committed to Iraq up to August 1928 by a Treaty which is a Treaty of Alliance, a term which can hardly be explained away as of no significance, even if it had not included in Article VII an express undertaking on our part &quot; to provide such support and assistance to the armed forces of Llis Majesty the King of Iraq as may from time to time be agreed.&quot; That Article is expanded in a Military Agreement, of which the general purport is unmistakable. It is enough to point out that its First Article clearly assumes that we share the responsibility for the defence of Iraq against external aggression until Iraq is capable of assuming the full burden itself, while the Seventh and Eighth Articles specifically absolve His Majesty s Government from any obligation to afford military assistance to the Iraq Government against external aggression in the event of failure to conform to the High Commissioner^ recommendations as to the dispositions of the Iraq Army, or in the event of operations being undertaken without previous consultation and agreement, or in the event of hostilities provoked or occasioned hj action taken or policy pursued by the Iraq Government contrary to the advice, express wishes or known policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government exceptions, all of which no less clearly imply a corresponding obligation where the Iraq Government has acted in accordance with our advice. We may, no doubt, be entitled to help from the League of Nations both as a mandatory or in the face of a violation of the Lausanne Treaty or of a League decision, a point more appropriately discussed at a later stage in the argument. But that does not in any sense diminish our own undoubted direct obligation for the defence of a State to which we stand in the double relationship of ally and trustee.Whatever the merits of the Iraq frontier question or the extent of our direct obligations towards Iraq, the fact remains that by the Treaty of Lausanne the Turks and ourselves have agreed to refer the settlement of the matter to the Council of the League of Nations, and, pending a decision, to respect the existing frontier. That the method of settlement thus agreed upon should be faithfully carried out is of even greater importance to us, and to the future authority of the League of Nations, than the actual verdict itself. The pacification of Europe embodied in the Locarno Treaties is based on the assumption that wide general undertakings to refer all possible causes of dispute to arbitration and to the conciliation and helpful authority of the League will be loyally observed when the particular future difficulty arises. What will be the value of these undertakings if, in the meantime, a quite specific undertaking of a similar character, little over a year old, should be disavowed by one party, while the other party should be intimidated into abandoning the pursuit of its claim, thus making clear ito the world both its disbelief in the power or will of the League to see its decisions respected, and its own unwillingness to support the authority of the League&apos;? It seems clear that, apart from our own interest in maintaining the integrity of Iraq, we are vitally concerned in the principle at stake
in our reference to the League. And in this respect all the other nations represented on the League are equally concerned with ourselves. To uphold the principle of a settlement declared and enforced by the League, and to use our influence and example to make the other members of the Council of the League realise their responsibility in this matter, is at this moment at least as essential a part of our task as the effective vindication of the Iraq case.The next step, in any case, rests with the Council of the League itself. When the Council meets next month The Hague Court will have given its opinion whether the reference under the Treaty of Lausanne is to the Council as an arbitrator (whether by majority vote or by a unanimous vote exclusive of the parties to the dispute) or as a mediator. In the former event, the Council may very probably feel itself justified by the terms of the opinion of the Court in regarding both parties as already bound in advance by the Treaty of Lausanne itself, or by that Treaty and the assurances given by Fethy Bey taken together, and, therefore, in ignoring anything that Rushdy Bey said in September, and proceeding without further ado to its decision. It is possible, however, that it may regard itself as obliged either by Rushdy Bey&apos;s previous disavowal of Fethy Bey&apos;s assurances and his declaration that Turkey could in no case regard the League as an arbitrator, or by a, similar attitude on his part at the first meeting, to begin by addressing to each party, as it did only a few days ago in the case of the Greeco-Bulgarian dispute, the definite question whether it is prepared to accept in advance the finding of the Council. In the case of a refusal by the Turkish representative, it might then possibly dismiss the Turkish claim altogether, or it might conceivably postpone decision of the case until Turkey comes forward of her own accord to announce her readiness to accept a decision, at the same time making it clear that the obligation to respect the Brussels line remains in force. That would, in fact, amount to an indefinite postponement, and might perhaps be preferred by the Turks as avoiding the necessity of a formal abandonment of their claim. Our own part in the matter would be confined to making it clear that we are anxious for a decision and ready to abide by it, and to restating our case in so far as that may be necessary.In the other alternative, that of the Court declaring that the reference under the Treaty of Lausanne is only to mediation, we are in the strong position of being in possession and of being protected by the terms of the Treaty with regard to the maintenance of the statics quo until a settlement is reached. We can therefore sit tight and refuse to consider any proposal put forward which is not in our view acceptable. The question is whether there is, in fact, any concession that we can make which would be accepted by the Turks or would, at any rate, ease the situation.population make a territorial concession almost impossible. Any shifting southwards of the frontier means pushing it back from the mountains on to the plain and gives away the whole defensive position. Moreover, on the north-west it would mean the. abandonment of some 80,000 Christians, who could not possibly stay on under Turkish rule, and would come upon our hands as refugee^. Nor is there the slightest reason to suppose that any such partial concession would in the least appease the Turks unless it included most of the Kurdish districts and Mosul itself. The question arises whether, apart from a direct concession of territory, there is any possibility of finding some device which, however inconvenient, might possibly save Turkish face. I have discussed with the Foreign Secretary various suggestions which have been put forward from this point of view, but we have come to the conclusion that no merely face-saving device is likely to have any effect in appeasing the Turks, and might only create administrative embarrassment and provoke friction in future. These objections would not apply to any arrangement, whether in the nature of a treaty of mutual friendship and arbitration, of a scheme of development loans or otherwise, which could be made with Turkey elsewhere than in Iraq, and which might form the basis of a new period of friendly co-operation. The possibility of some such friendly solution, has been discussed in. a Foreign Office memorandum recently circulated, and it is not necessary to elaborate the point here. Everything in that case would depend on the choice of the right moment for the initiative on our part, which might arise soon, or even immediately after a verdict in our favour, or the definite breakdown of any attempt at mediation through the agency of the League.There remains to be considered the possibility of a Turkish invasion of Iraq in defiance of a verdict of the League or in violation of the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne if an attempt at mediation has failed to secure agreement. In either event we are entitled to the support of the League.  We have in General Laidoner a LeagueUnfortunatelyand the distribution of the
representative already on the spot, and in a position to convey immediate and impartial information to the League, and so enable it to come to a quick decision. The fact that we are entitled to the support of the other members of the League does not, indeed, diminish our own direct responsibility, both in our treaty relationship to Iraq and as in a peculiar sense the representatives of the League on the spot, to take the measures immediately available to resist aggression. But any general coercive measures against Turkey would presumably be carried on in consultation and co-operation with the Council and with such other members of the League as might be in a position to assist. The prospect of such a general intervention is bound to have great weight with the Turk as a deterrent, especially after the very efficacious intervention of the League in the graeco-Bulgarian incident, and it is consequently -of the highest importance that the other Powers on. the Council, and more especially France, should make it quite clear to Turkey that the Council is determined to see that the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne, or its own verdict, as the case may be, are respected.The contingency of Turkish aggression is, however, very remote. Turkey stands to lose so much and to gain so little of real value to her in her effort at national regeneration that it is hardly conceivable that she will run the risk. She may bluff for a time or refuse to give a definite acceptance to the verdict, but she will eventually recognise facts there as she has always done elsewhere. The more definite the verdict and the more completely it secures the present frontier of natural equilibrium, if possible with the rectifications urged by us, the sooner that recognition will come, especially&apos;if we can sweeten the medicine with some definite gesture of friendliness and helpfulness which will preserve Mustafa Kemal&apos;s prestige.To sum up the conclusions of the argument which I have laid before the Cabinet, &quot;they are I. That the general policy which we have followed since 1921 of helping Iraq to stand on its own feet as soon as possible, and of continuing our general co-operation with the Iraq State after that in the interests of its stability and prosperous development, holds the field.2. That it is of the greatest importance to the success of that policy that the integrity of the present territory of Iraq should be maintained&quot;.3. That it is of the greatest importance to ourselves and to the general cause of peace that the method of peaceful settlement agreed in the Treaty of Lausanne should be sustained and enforced not only by ourselves but by other Powers represented on the Council.4. That the British representatives at the next meeting of the Council should use their best efforts to secure a definite verdict of the League in our favour and, generally, should be guided by the above conclusions.L.
