ti1 c.;. tiCXRCUIAR (3n*:lancl and Wales).a try of Health, .Vhitahall, S.V/.1.November, 1925. Sir.,I an directed by the Minister of Bo a 1th to refer to the Circular Letter which was sent to looal authorities in May 1922 (soe Appendix&apos;:) in which it was stated that it would be for local authorities to make such arrangements for the maintenance of looal services as might bo thought to bo required, in the event of need arising.The events of recent years have shown that an industrial disputo may be so extended as to interfere seriously with communications, tho conveyance of food and of other necessities, tho supply of light and power and the health and moans of livelihood of the population at large.     The remedies for the dangers and inconveniences of ouch a situation can best be supplied by decentralised organisation designed to secure the maintenance of servioes essential to the well-being of the community.Should such an emergency occur it is to their looal authorities that the people will naturally turn for help in the difficulties whioh they may have to meet, and in order that any aotion initiated locally may harmonise with tho national measures which the Government consider it desirablo to take they think it necessary now to communicate to local authorities tho following outline of the organisation which would be brought into operation by the Government to deal with essential services which ore not purely local in character.     Tils outline will, if it bo necessary, be supplemented by further details in a later communication.   By &quot;emergency&quot; is meant a state ,of affairsTOTown Councils.^ti^^^I^^oroii^h Coune ils. tlTrJah Pi^rloT^CouncITs.Iviini
necessitating the issue of a Proclamation undor the Emergency Powers Aot, 1920, as a preliminary to the issue of Regulations &quot;for securing tho essentials of lifo to tho country&quot;.The organisation which the Government proposo is designed to supplement and to assist In an emergency the normal methods of communication, supply and distribution and to give to all thoso who can help en opportunity of doing 30 in the raannor most required.    It la not intended that the Government should substitute now machinery for that ordinarily oxisting to moot the essential needs of tho community.1. A Ministor will in suoh an emergency act as Civil Commissioner on behalf of tho Govornmont in oach of ton Divisions covering the whole of England and Wales *     Ho will be assisted by a staff consisting mainly of representatives of the Departments of Government concerned and dealing with tho following subjocts:   Transport;   Pood;    Postal Services;    Coa It will bo tho duty of the Civil Commissioner and his staff during tho emergency to keep In touch with tho Local Authorities In.each Division and to bo available for consultation by them;    and he will be ompoworod if neoossary to give decisions on behalf of the Govornment.Tho towns in which Civil Commissioners will bo stationed and tho general outlines of the areas of tho Divisions for which thoy will act are sot out in Appendix BoThe Officora who will act as tho Chief Assistants to the Civil Commissioners and those who trill act as Technical ftepraaentativoa for the services mentioned hs%&apos;e been appointed, and those officers will, when tho need arises, Put themselves in touch with representatives of Local Authorities, and pro-vido them with such information as may be practicable in regard to details of the organisation.
8.   Eaoh Division Is dividod. into suitable areas for administering essential national servioes end If considered necessary fo** recruiting volunteers for thoso purposes.    In each area there will on an emergency bo a local Pooa Of floor, a local Road Officer and a Haulage Committee, and a coal omorgency Offloor, besides representatives (where required) for other essential services.     There will also bo a Chairman, solootod by tho Government to conveno and proaido over a Voluntoer Service Committee in oach area for tho roeruitmont of volunteers to assist in maintaining essential national services.     In any town in which the Chairman of tho Committee might consider it necessary to open a recruiting contre, it is earnestly hoped that it would bo found practicable for the Local Authority ooncamod to combine with him in making the centre available for recruiting both for national and for local purposes, allocating by arrangement voluntoero to local and national services in accordance with their qualifications and tho needs of tho occasion.   Local Authorities ape not expected to take any action so far as national services are concerned, unless and until approached by tho Chairman.3.   On an emorgonoy arising reliance will be placed to tho utmost oxtent upon normal channels for tho supply and distribution of food, and to this ond tha Divisional Pood Representative upon tho Civil Commissioner^ staff will arrange for consultation with tho principal traders as to the stocks of essential food-stuffs in thoir possesoion or in transit. In the event of any shortage or delay in tho supply of essential food-stuffs to the Division, tho Pood Representative will be in possession of information as to alternative sources of supply and tho moans to make thorn available.Local distribution and looal shortages not affootlng
national supplies will ordinarily be dealt with by the local Pood Officer.4. Road Transport will be dealt with on similar lines. The Road Commissioner upon the Civil Commissioner^ staff will be assisted by Road Officers and Haulage Committees in each of the areas comprised in the Division, who will endeavour by voluntary arrangement to promote the economical use of existing vehicles and where necessary the diversion of vehicles from less to more important services.     Road Commissioners and Road Officers will be furnished with powers to this end should the exercise of such powers prove necessary.5. Should the need arise full directions will be sent as to the supply and distribution of coal.     These directions may. If necessary, limit the supply of coal obtainable for any household or business, and may also place upon Local Authorities responsibilities for regulating the consumption of gas and electricity within their districts.     They would probably necessitate in most cases the allocation of a particular officer or officers by the Local Authority during the period that they were In force.The Local Authority will have the assistance of a Coal Emergency Officer and of a Committee of Traders within their own district.6. The maintenance of law and order and the protection of persons and property from violence may be one of the moat important servioes.     The organisation of the necessary arrangements and the control of the Police and Special Constabulary rest with the Police Authorities and the Chief Constables, but the Local Authorities might oo-operate, for instance, in securing able-bodied citizens of good character to serve as Special Constables.     The arrangements for the
enrolment of Special Constables will- be made by the Police, and any men who oome forward a? Special Constables, or who offer their services in a general capacity and appear most suited for service as Special Constables ahould be referred to the Police Station or other place of enrolment appointed for the purpose.7. While it is impossible to draw any hard and fast line of demarcation between national and local services which I? universally applicable the position may be broadly defined as follows:    Local Authorities are expected to undertake responsibility for the maintenance of local public utility services;    in addition they are asked to co-operate with the national organisation in regard to local transport and the local distribution of coal.     In the absence of further directions they are not expected to undertake responsibility for the local distribution of food nor are they asked to accept responsibility for shipping, railway or postal communications, or docks end harbours except where the Local Authority are also the Port Authority.3. It will be realised that in an emergency the burden upon national resources must in any event be considerable and responsibility could not be accepted by the Government for expenditure incurred by Local Authorities in meeting local needs.     Where however a joint recruiting station is established the expenditure incurred would have to be allocated between the Government and the Local Authority concerned.Precise instructions on this point would be issued to Chalrxcen of Volunteer Service Comaittees.I am, et c.
