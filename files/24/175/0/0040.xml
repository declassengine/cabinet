Memorandum on the present position of Church&apos; Schools.At present the public system of Elementary Education is divided into two classes of schools:     those provided by the Local Education Authority and those provided by voluntary bodies.     Eor practical purposes, voluntary bodies may be taken as meaning tho Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.     In a non-provided school the cost of staffing, equipment, and (substantially) upkeep of classrooms falls upon the Local Education Authority, but the Local Education Authority cannot close the school unless its numbers fall below 30 or transfer any of the children to other schools, except schools provided by the same denomination;    it does not appoint the teachers, though it has an ill-defined right of veto on appointments &quot;on educational grounds&quot;;    and it cannot contribute towards structural repairs or extensions or towards the upkeep or improvement of the playground. If, through failure to oarry out tho necessary repairs, the premises become unfit for continued use as a school they can be &quot;condemned&quot;.     The school may then either continue as a private school or it may be closed by the Managers.     In the latter case the Local Education Authority is responsible for providing new accommodation out of the rates;     it oan only compel the owner of the premises to transfer them to it by the exeraiBe of its general oompulsory powers of purchase.The Conservative Party pledged itself at the election to two main points of educational polioy:     the repair or replacement of unfit schools and the provision of better advanced instruction for children over the age of 11 by the
establishment of Central Schools, to which such children can be transferred from surrounding schools.     The dual system makes progress in these two directions difficult, if not impossible.     It also involves inefficiency and extravagance, owing to the difficulty of amalgamating small schools.     This has been increasingly realised by all sections of opinion during the last few years and it is now -generally folt that the existing system is administra-tively and financially Intolerable.     There-has been muoh discussion between the various denominations and between them and the Local Education Authorities.     These discussions have shown that opinion is divided somewhat as follows:-(l)   A small minority in the Church of England and a . number of extreme opponents of the Churoh would like to maintain the existing dual system, - the one because they think they can raise money to . .        put existing Church Schools right and to ..build new Central Schools:    the other because they oalculate that if they wait and do nothing, the Church Schools will have to be transferred to the Local Education Authorities through lack of funds *.... (S)   A larger section of Anglican opinion andprobably the bulk of Roman Catholic opinion would like to maintain the dual system but insist that the terms of settlement on which that system is now based should be varied to the advantage of the Church and that Local Education Authorities should be given wider powers to make grants out of the rates towards the upkeep and improvement of Church Schools,
A still larger section of Anglican opinion and an influential body of opinion in the Koman Catholic Church would like to supersede the existing dual system by an arrangement giving Local Education Authorities power to provide Denominational SchoolB out of the rates, either by the adoption of the Soottish system or by some analagoua scheme which would secure &quot;unity of administration with variety of type&quot;* A very influential body of opinion in the Church af England, probably representing a majority of Anglican Churchmen, together with the majority of the members of Looal Education Authorities and the bulk of moderate Nonconformist opinion, wish to oupersedd the existing dual ays tern by ah arrangement for the voluntary trans-fer of Churoh Schools to Local Eduoati on Author-itiea on terms which would enauro that &quot;undenon-national&quot; religious instruction should bo given in ail schools, and that children in transferred and Central Schools should, in addition, have the opportunity, either of receiving denominational instruction at sohool on one or two days in the week or of being withdrawn from aohool at spec-ifled times for denominational instruction in ohuroh or elsewhere.     it may be noted that Local Education Authorities already in practice provide for the giving of undenominational religious instruction in all schools, subject of course to the conscience clause, but there ia no legal means whereby they can puarantefr the permanent continuance of such arrangements.     Such a guar-antee would now be welcomed by all aections of religious opinion,without, probably, any exception.
Of these,alternatives (l) would probably be the best if Anglican,Church Schools were, as , they are not,&quot; : ft &apos;controlled by one Central Authority or at least by one Authority in each Diocese.     In the case of Roman Catholic Schools, where the Bishop is, in fact, the controlling Authority, experience shows tha,t the necessary money can be raised, not only, for upkeep of present schools, but also for new Central Schools.     The &quot;dual system&quot; would work reasonably well if it were only dual.     A strong bentral Church Authority could probably raise money; it would amalgamate small Church Schools, thereby effecting large economies to the rates, and it would be wise enough to placate Nonconformists by surrendering to the Local Education Authority a number of small ,schools in &quot;single-school areas&quot; at the same time as it relieved the rates by providing new Central Schools for the older children.     In practice,, however, the Managers of each Anglican sohool are a law to themselves and, in tho absence of special inducements to transfer schools, such as those suggested in (4), schools are now being transferred or retained by the Church, not accord-Zing.to any plan, but haphazard according to the keenness or the slackness of individual Managers or Vicars,     Such a policy renders efficient and economical administration impossible and it does -not satisfy any important section, of opinion -Nonconformist, Roman Catholic or Anglican,Neither (2) nor (3) appears to be politically possible.      (2) is open to all the objections already advanced against (l) and, in addition, it would be opposed by the great majority of
Nonconformists as tending to. bolster up a dying system -which they have always disliked,,     It is, however j. remarkable,; as showing the happy state of public opinion at this momentt that a resolution in favour of this policy was adopted unanimously some time ago by the lancashire County Councils (3) would not only meet with the same opposition, but would be administratively unworkable.     It is feasible in Scotland.where there are comparatively few denominational schools., but in England it would involve a &quot;creed register&quot; of parents which would only be practicable in a few homogeneous Roman Catholic areas like certain districts in Liverpool.(4) has behind it by far the greatest weight of opinion and it has, moreover j, three great advantages. It makes any change in the existing system purely optional;   it throws upon Local Education Authorities who desire a change the: onus of negotiating terns suitable, to local conditions and aooeptable to local opinion, and it involves the minimum of change in the existing law.-   In the appendix to this Memorandum will be   found a report which has &quot;been made to the County Councils1 Association by a Committee which oaino to eee the President of the Board of Education on this subject on April Slst. As the members of the Deputation have taken the whole responsibility for this recommendation on their own shoulders without committing the President in any way, he did not foel that he oould raise any objection to the terms of the report,
So far as the President can at present foresee there will now he no need to make any formal public statement on this subject in the near future, but he feels that he must be in a position-to ;-define his attitude in general terms if he is consulted by Chairmen of Local Education Authorities cr ethers, as he has already been and will certainly continue to be. In dealing with Locai Education Authorities, it is, of&quot; course, impossible to keep such discussions private; quotation ia inevitable. We submit therefore that the-Government&apos;e.policy should be as follows:-1.&apos; &apos;        The Government has no intention of imposing a new national settlement of the religious question oh Local Authorities by general legislation.     It cannot undertake negotiations with any denomination for such a settlement, 2, The Government does hot, on the other hand,wish to prevent or discourage Local Authorities or School Managers and the authorities of the religious denomination providing the school from entering into such negotiations themselves with the objeot &quot;of removing the administrative difficulties inherent in the dual system on terms generally acceptable to the local- interests,concerned,&apos; &apos;   3,    .      In the event of a considerable number ofLocal.Authorities entering into ouch negotiate and producing&apos; agreed schemes. the Government wo in,&apos;principle be prepared to Introduce enabling- legislation to facilitate the adoption of such schemes, provided-that it&apos; is satisfied that su( legislation is generally acceptable.
4,        The Government is, in particular, anxious to co-operate with Looal Education Authorities in ensuring that adequate religious instruction shall &quot;be given in all schools within the provisions of Section 26 of the Aot of 1921.
lEKORANDIfll Off DEPUTATION.A Deputation, consisting of Dr. P.R,Jackson (v/est Riding), Sir Mark Collet, Bart. (Kent), Major A.Le2fcester-Penrhyn (Surrey) , Mr, P.E,Meadon (Lancashire), and Mr, P,G,Peek (Derbyshire), attended at the Board of Education on the 21st April to discuss with the President the Lancashire Resolution and the position created by the Board&apos;s action in undertaking a sux*vey of the premises of Elementary Schools throughout the country.They pointed out that a large proportion of the schools included in the Board1 s li3t would be voluntary schools -where the problem of providing funds would, in many cases, be acute.     The question of the grouping of schools for advanced instruction was also mentioned.It became apparent in the course of discussion that, while there was unanimity among the members of the Deputation as to the administrative difficulties of the present position, their views as to the best method of dealing with these difficulties differed widely according to varying local conditions, and that the remedy which they sought seemed to lie in the direction of an enabling Act which would allow Local Education Authorities and other bodies concerned discretion, within fairly wide limits,  to come to such voluntary arrengements among themselves as would best suit the conditions in each area.The President, having heard the Deputation, made it clear that he could not consider what action, if any, he* &quot;That the Education Committee of the County Councils1 Association be asked to approach the Board of Education with the view of ascertaining whether some steps can be taken by Local Education Authorities in the direction of improvement of buildings of Voluntary Schools&quot;.9 (\ 9ki y t*
oould take until he had before him definite expressions ofopinion from the Local Authorities, and the Sub-Committee,therefore, suggest that the County Education Authoritiesshould,  if they so desire, after conference -with all parties interested, work out schemes for dealing with thevarious problems arising in connection with voluntary schools in their areas.
