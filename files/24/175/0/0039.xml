Memorandum hy the Home Secretary.On receipt of Lord Eustace Percy&apos;s memorandum CPi 427(25) I took steps,  in conjunction with the Chief Civil Commissioner, to ascertain the views of the Civil Commissioners and their Chief Assistants upon the question of the recruitment of labour by the Government in advance of an emergency.    I now have these views and am In a position to communicate them to the Cabinet.    I suggest, however, that it would be better if the whole matter were discussed in the first instance by the Supply and Transport Committee of the Cabinet.    The Committee could at the same time examine the other matters referred to in Lord Eustace Percy&apos;s memorandum, including the difficult question of &quot;peaceful picketing&quot; on which my Department is preparing a full memorandum.W.J.H,20th October,  1925.,(This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s government..)SECRET. &apos;?-        &quot;H                                               CABINET.
