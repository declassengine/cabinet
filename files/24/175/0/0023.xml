THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. -RATIFICATION OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONVENTIONS. MEMORANDUM BY THS MINISTER OP LABOUR.-    -      - 1 -----     -------it ill r itin   r i. - -       . i ii i. - ir m,,r utiu- i  -     1.11 ijhii i.   -........l i i    i . . .iSECRET &apos;CP.423 (25).        &apos; **&quot;    &quot;&quot;&quot;1. Now that the Merchant Shipping (International Labour Conventions) Act has been passed into law, it is necessary to decide whether the Government will formally ratify the three conventions to which the Act gives effect,2,  The Cabinet Committee on International Labour Policy dealt in its recommendations with the policy to be followed by H.M*Government with regard to future ratifications  (C.P..198(25 ). Pages 9 and 10).    The Act.in question had already made conaider-able progress in Parliament before the Committee reported and does not therefore contain the safeguarding clause about ratification recommended by the Committee.    The Committee, however, recommended that &quot;while&apos; in cases where existing British legislation carries out the provisions of a convention the British Government need not bind themselves in advance not to ratify until other countries had done so, the question of delaying British ratification in order to secure ratification elsewhere would always be considered by the Government of the day&quot;.3.  In the present case the following ratifications of the conventions involved have already been registered:-Unemployment Indemnity.    Belgium, Bulgaria, Esthonia, Italy, &apos; Poland, and Spain.Employment of young Persons as   Trimmers or Stokers.:i Bulgaria, Denmark, Esthonia, India, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Spain and Sweden,Medical Examination of Young Persons.    Bulgaria, Esthonia, India, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Poland, Roumania, Spain and Sweden.
la4. It will be seen that none of these conventions has yet been ratified by Prance, Germany., Holland or Norway,  and It might be argued that on these grounds Great Britain would be justified in delaying ratification.     On the other hand the obligations imposed by the conventions are slight, the Act is already In operation and delay in ratification would most probably l^r misinterpreted as a mark of general hostility to the International Labour Organisation, while I doubt whether in matters of this calibre, such a course would have much effect in the direction of securing additional ratifications abroad.5. I should add that the Board of Trade has been consulted and share the views expressed above.In these circumstances, I hope my colleagues will authorise me to take the necessary steps towards ratification without delay.(Intd.)     A. S-M.Ministry of Labour,. 8th October,1925.
