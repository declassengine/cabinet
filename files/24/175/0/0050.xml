[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] 248Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.MEMORANDA RESPECTING THE IRAK FRONTIER DISPUTE,Circulated by Direction of the Secretary oe State for Foreign Affairs.Mr. Chamberlain has read these memoranda and directed that they should be circulated to the Cabinet at once. In the short time available to him before leaving for Paris, it has not been possible for him to add his comments, which he will make verbally to the Cabinet. .,Foreign Office, October 25, 1925.I.An Attempt to Estimate the Considerations that will Influence or Decide Turkish Policy in the Question of Mosul.General.For all practical purposes Mustafa Kemal is both the Turkish Government and Turkey. He is a practical idealist and a constructive patriot with far-reaching ambitions which have already attained a considerable degree of realisation. His aim is to create a new, modernised, independent Turkish State which will be recognised as an equal by the civilised States of the world. His model is Japan and his methods are those of Mussolini. His difficulties are formidable. The country is impoverished in population and wealth, and poor in commercial and industrial experience and organisation. Politically, it is hardly awakened and unfit, for at least a generation, for the parliamentary self-government which he plans for it. He has few able assistants and is unfortunate in having antagonised several of the men who might have been of greatest assistance to him. He will not tolerate personal or parliamentary opposition. The modern parliamentary system which he established has proved to be premature, and he has assumed an undisguised dictatorship. This has made him enemies and imposed on him the necessity of maintaining his popularity at all costs.Political: Internal.The question of prestige is the lesser of the two vital considerations governing Kemals attitude in the Mosul question. In mistaken reliance on the power and authority of the Rothermere-Beaverbrook press he launched the Turkish press, to which he allows less independence even than Mussolini to the Italian, on a campaign which has practically committed him to obtaining Mosul for Turkey. His failure to do so will be a severe blow to his personal prestige at home and abroad. And at home it is manifestly in need of the stimulus of a success; both the large and influential officer class and the mass of the population are chaffing under his necessarily autocratic methods and are inclined to ask whether the system of a personal dictatorship, with all its inconveniences, is justified by its results. A complete and confessed failure to fulfil his boasts and promises about Mosul will therefore be a very severe blow, and he may well be regretting the commitment deriving from his unsuccessful bluff at the time of the last meeting of the Council of the League.A second and more important consideration of internal politics is the Question of Kurdistan. KemaTs policy is to assimilate the Kurdish population into the new State of Turkey. The Kurds are essential, both racially and militarily, as breeders of citizens&quot; and as defenders of the State. The policy of the Irak Government and of His Majesty&apos;s Government, endorsed by the League Commission, 3117   [13742] B
Is to plant the seeds of autonomy among the Iraki Kurds. The inevitable result is that the Kurds over the Turkish border, always in a state of effervescence and at present openly rebellious, will be fortified in their resistance to the process of assimilation and sooner or later will claim their right to coalesce with their semi-independent brothers in Irak. This will mean the loss of valuable population and territory to Turkey a threat which must be averted at all costs. This realisation probably explains the Turkish suggestion of a guarantee of the Turkish and Iraki frontiers, and it might go far to satisfy Kemal if we could in any&apos; way guarantee Turkey against this danger. But it is difficult to see how we can do so without betraying the unquestionable rights of the Kurds to national development and ultimate independence.So much for the considerations of internal policy in Turkey. They are not calculated to facilitate acceptance by Kemal of any award by the Council that does not satisfy the Turkish claim.Political: External.Kemal undoubtedly looks to the time when the new Turkey will be received into the comity of civilised States, and probably, if it were not for the Mosul question, he would not hesitate to signify Turkey&apos;s accession to the League of Nations. For he would realise the value to Turkey of the guarantees contemplated by the Covenant as an insurance against the Russian danger. He would also appreciate the recognition of Turkey by the other members of the League. During the period between the armistice and the signature of; the Treaty of Lausanne Turkey enjoyed a fictitious power and importance, largely owing to her skill in exploiting differences between the Allies. Now she stands alone and friendless except for Russia, whose immediate motives and ultimate ambitions are the greatest menace she has to face. No doubt Kemal justly appreciates the value and danger of Russian support. In the past he was able to make good use of this support political, financial and military - without incurring counter-obligations. It is by no means certain that he could do so again. He is probably acutely conscious of Turkey&apos;s loneliness and, equally probably, would go to great lengths to secure a guarantee of Turkish territory by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Locarno meeting has proclaimed the solidarity of a saner Europe, with.which Tukey hopes to associate herself, and revealed the isolation and failure of Turkey&apos;s only friend and most dangerous enemy, Russia.Financial.Kemal is aware that Turkey will need foreign capital for the many development schemes which he contemplates. Her credit does not stand high abroad and her needs are probably becoming increasingly urgent. In these circumstances, deliberately to flout the League would inevitably jeopardise her prospects of obtaining loans from the members of the League. Military operations against Irak and Great Britain would throw a further burden on the already overtaxed Turkish exchequer and the expenditure could only be justified by desperate need or by the prospect of assured political and financial results.On the other hand, it is likely that the hope of securing for Turkey the wealth inherent in the oil deposits of the Mosul Vilayet remains a consideration of great weight.Military.On the face of it it would seem that Kemal could only be induced to embark on a military venture by the imperative needs of internal politics or by a confident belief that a military bluff would succeed owing to the refusal of opinion in this country to sanction a war with Turkey on behalf of Mosul. For there are cogent arguments against a military adventure, the success of which would inevitably be precarious. While a forced march on the city of Mosul might succeed, it would be another matter to occupy and hold the vilayet; reinforcements would probably be forthcoming from India and elsewhere, the lines of communication would be difficult, and, in the winter months, impossible, the imperfectly pacified and disarmed Kurds would be in the rear of the Turkish forces, the Turkish coast would be vulnerable from the sea and the interior of the country from the air, and the political and financial effects of flouting the League and defying His Majesty&apos;s Government would be incalculable.The deductions from the considerations suggested above (and both premises and deductions are necessarily of an exceptionally speculative nature) would seem to be as follows : 
1. A military adventure would be a policy of desperation and of doubtful success. It would not appear that Kemal&apos;s need is immediately desperate. May the adoption of the policy, therefore, not be regarded as unlikely?2. An intensification of military bluff, is a possibility, or even probability, which must be contemplated and met, if need be, with all firmness.3. Whether or not combined with 2, a continuation of the policy of obstruction and procrastination by the exploitation or improvisation of legal objec-tions and any other expedients that offer themselves may probably be looked for as long as the game pays.4. This mav be terminated by an eventual climb-down, represented as a reluctant-tant yielding to moral and material force majeure, in return for any compensatory and face-saving concessions that can be secured.Putting aside any possibility of territorial readjustments, it is perhaps not inherently fanciful to suggest that a compromise settlement might be attained, with or without the aid of the League, in return for the following :  (a.) Some sort of guarantee against the danger of the loss of Turkish Kurdistan. The obvious suggestion is a guarantee of the Turkish and Iraki frontiers, but it is questionable if we could give this. A frank recognition and discussion of this difficulty might be of value in evolving some expedient.(b.) Some face-saving device by which Kemal could justify himself to Turkey. This would have to be based upon some actual or apparent concession by His Majesty&apos;s Government and combined with some political comperisa-tion involving a personal success for Kemal and a political advantage for Turkey.We have heard much of the effects that would result from a friendly gesture, though we have hitherto been led to suppose that this was simply another name for submitting to the Turkish claim to Mosul. It may be capable of other interpretation and expression. Politically isolated as she is, and yet aspiring to recognition as a modern civilised State, Turkey should be doubly susceptible to any international courtesy. Uncouth, ill-mannered, aggressive and unreliable, she is at the same time conscious of her isolation and anxious to exchange the sinister patronage of Russia for political friendship and financial support. And, in spite of her mistrust of us, she would probably be glad to see us in the position of her insurance broker and financial backer. But while His Majesty&apos;s Government ask nothing better than to live in amity with her, and while British capital could probably Be attracted to her industrial development in return for adequate security, we cannot contemplate a reversion to the Victorian policy of guaranteeing Turkey against Russia. The suggestion of any guarantee of Turkish territorial integrity is, therefore, excluded. But might not something in the nature of a spectacular burying of the hatchet be contrived ? For example, might not a treaty of friendship and arbitration, combining the maximum of moral implication with the minimum of material commit-ment, be suggested ? The initiative would have to come from His Majesty&apos;s Government and the moment carefully chosen. It would unfortunately be useless to propose that Kemal should come to London, whether to discuss Mosul or a treaty, but something might possibly be made of a flattering invitation, conveyance on a British warship, &amp;c. However, in present circumstances, it is perhaps useless to speculate upon such possibilities. We are still too much in the dark in regard to feelings and intentions at Angora. And Sir R. Lindsay can be relied upon to offer suggestions for the friendly gesture that has on various occasions been hinted at, should he consider that the time for it has arrived. It is, however, conceivable that a variation of the policy adopted towards Germany at Locarno might succeed with Turkey.It would also be useful if His Majesty&apos;s Government. could give Turkey some assurances in respect of financial assistance, but, pending a settlement of the debt question, this presents considerable difficulty. It is unfortunately too late to offer her a share in the Mosul oil development scheme.Eastern Department, Foreign Office, October 23, 1925.13742]
An Appreciation oe the Turkish Attitude.The question has been raised, what action are the Turks likely to take in connection with the Irak frontier question? Will they await the outcome of the impending proceedings at The Hague Court, and the action subsequently taken by . the Council of the League of Nations ? Or are they likely to embark on aggressive movements against Irak, with a view to create an accomplished fact, as was done by General Zeligowski in the case of Vilna ?Several factors exist which may restrain the Turks from resorting to aggression. In the first place, the winter is coming on and in a few weeks the provisional frontier (&quot; Brussels line&quot;) will be well nigh impassable for any considerable bodies of troops with their baggage and ammunition, except in the small non-mountainous section at the western end of the line, where our defensive measures could be concentrated. Secondly, the Turks would have to the rear of their attacking force the region of Turkish Kurdistan, which is still far from completely pacified after the recent rebellion, and has kept a large part of the Turkish army busy throughout the present year. Thirdly, it would not be easy for the Turks, even if they succeeded in pushing their troops forward as far as Mosul town, to maintain the long line of communications with their bases at Jezireh and Diarbekir; for this line runs through a country with a mixed population of Arabs, Kurds, Christians and Turkomans, who would not be unanimous in welcoming the invading force, and the Turks must realise that we have quite sufficient air forces to impede their progress by aerial bombardment.Apart from these military considerations, there are certain indications of a political nature that the Turkish Government are not anxious to court a serious quarrel or an open breach with us at the present juncture. They have evidently &quot; called off&quot; the violent agitation in the Turkish press which persisted throughout the recent discussions at Geneva; the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs talked hopefully to Sir R. Lindsay at Constantinople (on his way back from Geneva to Angora) about the possibility of a settlement by diplomatic discussion between the two Governments; the Turkish newspapers have since then been full of statements that direct negotiations are about to open; the difficulties of the internal situation in Turkey (Kurdish unrest, financial embarrassment, &amp;c.) are still sufficiently acute to render a breathing space of peaceful progress highly desirable, if not an absolute necessity; and although Russian influence continues to count for much at Angora, the friendship of Moscow is not yet a factor on which the Turks can rely with absolute confidence. It may also be observed that while the Turks have declined to appear before The Hague Court, their message to the court was couched in studiously courteous terms, and they have not taken any step which could be construed as flouting the League or forcing the pace by any flagrant and open violation of the status quo apart from their habitual persecution of Christian minorities on their side of the Brussels line.On the other hand, it would be a mistake to suppose that all danger of the Turk running amok is now definitely eliminated. Like all dictatorships, the Kemal regime can only subsist on successes; and it seems more than doubtful whether Kemal could survive a complete climb-down from the Turkish claim to the whole Mosul vilayet (possibly excluding the small Diala irrigation region), which he has so long and loud proclaimed to be an irreducible minimum. It is therefore quite possible that the Turks&apos; motive in adopting a less truculent attitude and mooting the ideas of direct negotiation, of an Anglo-Perso-Turkish Security Pact, &amp;e, is to be found in a belief that these tactics are more likely to secure a settlement favourable to their claims than awaiting an arbitral decision or even a mere mediation by the League Council. Unfortunately, our whole position in Irak is such as to render it impossible for us to make any concession or abatement of our claim, which would save KemaTs face or give him a golden bridge over which he could retreat and justify himself to the Angora Assembly and public opinion.Eastern Department, Foreign Office, October 23, 1925.
Memorandum by the Legal Advisers to the Foreign Office.The Council of the League has, acting under the last sentence of article 14* of the Covenant, requested the Permanent Court of International Justice to give an advisory opinion on the following questions : 1. What is the character of the decision to be taken by the Council in virtue of article 3, paragraph 2, of the Treaty of Lausanne ; is it an arbitral award, a recommendation or a simple mediation? 2. Must the decision be unanimous, or may it be taken by a majority?  May tho representatives of the interested parties take part in the vote ?It is somewhat misleading to speak of the finding of the Court in such circum-stances as a &quot;decision.&quot; There is a clear distinction between the determination of a dispute by the Court under the second sentence of article 14 and an advisory opinion under the last sentence. The latter is merely an opinion given to the Council at its request to assist it in dealing with some matter which is before it. As between Turkey and Great Britain, the finding of the Court will not, from a legal point of view, alter the existing situation at all; it is merely a preliminary step in the pro-ceedings of the Council, and it is the final action of the Council for which Turkey and Great Britain have, under article 3 (2) of the Treaty of Lausanne, to wait.Further, while the opinion of the Court would no doubt be regarded by the Council as authoritative as regards the legal questions submitted to it, it does not necessarily follow that the Council would act upon it any more than an individual necessarily acts upon the advice of the lawyer whom he consults. If the Court were to advise that the Council has the power to give an arbitral decision which is binding on Turkey and Great Britain, the Council would no doubt accept this definition of its powers; but, although it may be hoped that the Council would then be prepared to give such a decision, one cannot be certain that political considerations might not lead it to attempt to effect a settlement by agreement. Similarly, if the Court advised that the arbitral decision could be given by a majoritjr of the Council, the Council would no doubt accept this as a correct statement of the legal position, but it does not necessarily follow that the Council would be prepared to promulgate a decision which was only supported by a bare majority.For present purposes it will suffice to consider the possible findings of the Court under two heads : 1. Where the Court holds that the Council has power to give a decision which is binding on the parties, even if it is not accepted by one or both of them.2. Where the Court holds that no settlement of the frontier question can be effected by the Council unless both parties concur in it.In the first case, it may, perhaps, be assumed that the Council would ultimately succeed in laying down a frontier line, but, if the Turks continue to maintain their present attitude, it is possible that the tendency of the Council would be to corn-promise, i,e., to divide the disputed territory. This tendency is more likely to prevail if opinion on the Council is divided; if the Court advises that unanimity (apart from the parties to the dispute) is necessary, a compromise may be the only means oi getting a decision at all, while, even if the Court advised that a majority decision would suffice, an appreciable minority might quite likely be in a position to impose a compromise.If, on the other hand, the Court advises that the consent of the parties is necessary, it would seem that the result must be either a compromise accepted by both parties or no decision, in the sense of a definitive fixing of the frontier, at all. In the latter case, it would seem that the &quot; decision&quot; referred to in article 3 (2) of the Treaty of Lausanne would not have been taken, and consequently that the status quo provided for in that paragraph would continue. The result as regards the status quo ought to be the same if the Court found that the Council had power to give an arbitral decision without the consent of the parties and %he Council gave i decision which Turkey refused to accept, for, as the Turks maintain that the powers of the Council under article 3 (2) do not extend to imposing a frontier upon them,* The relevant, articles will be found in the appendix overleaf.[13742] B 3
they would in the suggested circumstances be bound to hold that the decision referred to in that paragraph had not been given, in which case the status quo would have to be maintained.There remains the question of what the position would be if Turkey were to commit an act of aggression against Irak. This might happen either before the decision of the Council was given, or after a decision had been given which Turkey did not accept, or after the Council had failed to reach a decision.The normal procedure would be for Great Britain to notify the League of the violation of the status quo and of the existence of a dispute between Great&quot; Britain and Turkey, and Turkey would be invited under article 17 to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute upon such conditions as the Council might deem just.*If Turkey refused the invitation and resorted to war against Great Britain by invading Irak, article 16 would apply and the sanctions provided by that article should be let loose against Turkey.If Turkey accepted the invitation, the matter would be dealt with in accordance with articles 12 to 15. Acceptance of the invitation by Turkey should involve the cessation of any hostile measure against Irak, because otherwise article 16 would at once apply, since Turkey had accepted membership of the League for the purposes of the dispute, tThe action which the Council would take would depend on the circumstances in which the act of aggression had been committed. If the decision of the Council had not yet been given, Turkey would have violated not only the last paragraph of article 3 (2) of the Treaty of Lausanne, but her undertaking given to the League, and the Council could hardly refuse to call upon Turkey to withdraw her forces pending the League&apos;s decision, and if she refused, to apply article 16. If the act of aggression occurred after the Council had given a decision which, according to the opinion of the Court, it was competent to give but which Turkey did not accept, the Council would be bound to stand by its decision as to the frontier and to call upon Turkey to withdraw behind it, and, if Turkey refused, article 16 would again apply. If the act of aggression occurred after the Council had failed to reach a decision, the position would (assuming that it can be successfully argued, as suggested above, that the status quo is to continue until such time as the Council finally succeeds in reaching a decision) be the same as in the first of the three cases under consideration, since Turkey would have violated the status quo.In the above observations no attempt has been made to distinguish the present question from an ordinary frontier dispute, on the ground that Great Britain is only concerned in Irak as a mandatory under article 22 of the Covenant. The point is obviously important, but as the position of Great Britain depends not on an ordinary mandate, but on the Council&apos;s decision of the 27th September, 1924, accepting the Anglo-Irak Treaty and the British undertakings to the League in connection therewith, the situation is not quite the same as it would be in the case of an attack on an ordinary mandated territory. It seems probable, in any case, that the special position of Great Britain in the matter would result, not so much in any alteration of the procedure by which the League would deal with the matter, as in a greater willingness on the part of the Council to assist a country which may, at any rate to some extent, still be regarded as representing in Irak the interests of the League. It is obvious that this willingness should be increased if it could be shown that Turkey&apos;s action amounted to a flouting of the authority of the League, as it would do if it involved either a breach of Turkey&apos;s undertaking to the Council to maintain the status quo pending its decision, or a refusal to accept a decision which the Permanent Court had held that the Council was entitled to give.October 23, 1925.* It would not be so effective to bring- the matter to the notice of the League under article 11, because it is held that the powers of the Council under that article are Confined to making recommendations.j Under article 16 it would, following the resolution of the Second Assembly, be the duty of all members of the League, subject to the general initiative of the Council, in the first place to break off diplomatic relations with Turkey, and then progressively to, adopt coercive measures against her until she abstained from warlike proceedings.
APPENDIX.Articles of the Covenant referred to in Memorandum III.Article 11.Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary-General shall on the request of any member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.It is also declared to be the friendly right of each member of the League to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.Article 12.The members of the League agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter either to arbitration or to enquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the report by the Council.In any case under this article the award of the arbitrators shall be made within a reasonable time, and the report of the Council shall be made within six months after the submission of the dispute.Article 13.The members of the League agree that whenever any dispute shall arise between them which they recognise to be suitable for submission to arbitration and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, they will submit the whole subject-matter to arbitration.Disputes as to the interpretation of a treaty, as to any question of international law, as to the existence of any fact which if established would constitute a breach of any international obligation, or as to the extent and nature of the reparation to be made for any such breach, are declared to be among those which are generally suitable for submission to arbitration.Tor the consideration of. any such dispute the court of arbitration to which the case is referred shall be the court agreed on by the parties to the dispute or stipulated in any convention existing between them.The members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award that may be rendered and that they will not resort to war against a member of the League which complies therewith. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto. &apos;Article 14.The Council shall formulate and submit to the members of the League for adoption plans for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice. The Court shall be competent to hear and determine any dispute of an international character which the parties thereto submit to it. The Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or by the Assembly.Article 15.If there should arise between members of the League any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, which is not submitted to arbitration as above, the members of the League agree that they will submit the matter to the Council. Any party to the dispute may effect such submission by giving notice of the existence of the dispute to the Secretary-General, who will make all necessary arrangements for a full investigation and consideration thereof.For this purpose the parties to the dispute will communicate to the Secretary-General, as promptly as possible, statements of their case with all the relevant facts -and papers, and the Council may forthwith direct the publication thereof.
The Council shall endeavour to effect a settlement of the dispute, and if such efforts are successful a statement shall be made public, giving such facts and explanations regarding the dispute and the terms of settlement thereof as the Council, may deem appropriate.If the dispute is not thus settled, the Council, either unanimously or by a majority vote, shall make and publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are deemed just and proper in regard thereto.Any member of the League represented on the Council may make public a statement of the facts of the dispute and of its conclusions regarding the same.If a report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the members of the League agree that they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which, complies with the recommendations of the report.If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice.If the dispute between the parties is claimed by one of them, and is found by the Council to arise out of a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the Council shall so report, and shall make no recommendation as to its settlement.The Council may in any case under this article refer the dispute to the Assembly. The dispute shall be so referred at the request of either party to the dispute, provided that such request be made within fourteen days after the submission of the dispute to the Council.In any case referred to the Assembly, all the provisions of this article and of article 12 relating to the action and powers of the Council shall apply to the action and powers of the Assembly, provided that a report made by the Assembly, if concurred in by the representatives of those members of the League represented on the Council and of a majority of the other members of the League, exclusive in each case of the representatives of the parties to the dispute, shall have the same force as a report by the Council concurred in by all the members thereof other than the^ representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute.Article 16.Should any member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a member of the League or not.It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to, protect the covenants of the League,The members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and: that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.Any member of the League which has,violated any covenant of the League may be declared to be no longer a member of the League by a vote of the Council concurred.. in by the representatives of all the other members of the League represented thereon.Article 17.In the event of a dispute between a member of the League and a State which is not a member of the League, or between States not members of the League, the State or States not members of the League shall be invited to accept the obligations of
membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, upon such conditions as the Council may deem just. If such invitation is accepted, the provisions of s articles 12 to 16 inclusive shall be applied with such modifications as may be deemed necessary by the Council.Upon such invitation being given the Council shall immediately institute an enquiry into the circumstances of the dispute and recommend such action as may seem best and most effectual in the circumstances.If a State so invited shall refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, and shall resort to war against a member of the League, the provisions of article 16 shall be applicable as against the State taking such action.If both parties to the dispute when so invited refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, the Council may take such measures and make such recommendations as will prevent hostilities and will result in the settlement of the dispute.Article 22.To those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the late war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilisation and that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in this Covenant.The best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that the tutelage of such peoples should be entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position, can best undertake this responsibility, and who are willing to accept it, and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as mandatories on behalf of the League.The character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of the development of the people, the geographical situation of the territory, its economic conditions and other similar circumstances.Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the mandatory.Other peoples, especially those of Central Africa, are at such a stage that the mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience or religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic and the liquor traffic, and the prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory, and will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other members of the League.There are territories, such as South-West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands, which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilisation, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the mandatory, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population!In every case of mandate, the mandatory shall render to the Council an annual report in reference to the territory committed to its charge.The degree of authority, control, or administration to be exercised by the mandatory shall, if not previously agreed upon by the members of the League, be explicitly defined in each case by the Council.A permanent commission shall be constituted to receive and examine the annua? reports of the mandatories and to advise the Council on all matters relating to the --observance of the mandates
