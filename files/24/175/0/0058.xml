3.,       Matters arising out of First Report.(a) Merchandise Marks Legislation,    The Chairman reported that since Chr.&apos; last meeTThg&quot; of&apos; the Committee the First Report had been published and that a letter had, at the same time, been issued by the Prime Minister thanking the Committee for its work and promising to take the Report into early consideration, although naturally stating his inability to commit the Government in advance to any of the recommendations made.51ri Algernon Firth enquired whether any statement could be made as to the attitude the Home Government were adopting regarding the recommendations relating to the marking of Empire and foreign good3. He understood that the Ministry of Agriculture Bill, which the Committee had adopted as the basis of their recommendations regarding marking, was to be with-drawn and a Board of Trade Bill which would deal with both agricultural produce and manufactured goods introduced in the next session. He urged very strongly that any such connection of agricultural produce with manufactured goods would be detrimental to an early enactment of the Committee&apos;s recommendations. The question of manufactured goods was seriously complicated &quot;by differences of opinion between the Federation of British Industries and the Associated Chambers of Commerce, whereas the question of agricultural produce was a comparatively simple matter and likely to raise little opposition in the House of Commons, He suggested,  therefore that the Chairman should represent to the Government the importance of maintaining a clear distinction in their Merchandise Marks proposals between agricultural produce and manufactured good3, and that, if possible, these matters ought to be dealt with in separate Bills,This view was supported by Sir Sydney Henn and Sir Atul Chandra Chatterjee who suggested that the attention of the Government might specially^be drawn to paragraph 45 (4) of the First Report which referred specifically to the Ministry of Agriculture Bill.Other members of the Committee concurred in this view and emphasised the importance of action being taken as soon as possible in regard to Merchandise Marks Legislation to enable the publicity campaign which the Committee had recommended to be inaugurated without delay.The Chairman undertook to communicate the views expressed by the Committee to the Government at the earliest possible opportunity 0(b) The Executive Commission and the Publicity Campaign.Mr. Crawford, enquired whether the Chairman was in a position to give&apos; any information to the Committee regarding the action His Majesty&apos;s Government were likely to take on the recommendations contained in the First Report as to the establishment of an Executive Commission and also  as to the nature of the publicity campaign. He himself regarded the recommendations of the Committee on these subjects as the keystone of the Report. He recognised that those recommendations were not detailed but this had been intentional. He thought that the importance they attached to the principles laid down in their Rerort had not been appreciated. He suggested that the Committee should now consider the possibilityof
tl 1 *?of supplying to the home Government their detailed views in regard to both these matters.The Chairman replied that he understood that the Home Government&apos;had&apos;as yet taken no decision on the First Report. The Departments concerned had been considering the matter and he anticipated that the Cabinet would be deciding at an early date what action was to be taken. He agreed that the principle of an independent body carrying out the executive duties which the Economic Committee had proposed had been regarded as vital to the success of such a publicity campaign as they contemplated. He undertook, if consulted by the Home Government on the subject, that he would identify himself with the principles embodied in the recommendations Of the First Report, and would bring before the Committee any   Information which he received where he thought that this information was such as ought to be before them.Mr. MoDougall stated that in discussions he had had with Members of His Majesty1 s Government he had ventured to make two suggestions -(1) That the Committee should be given an opportunity of making clear in detail the nature of the publicity campaign which they had recommended; and(2) that they might, if it was found at all possible, be permitted to offer their views on the type of organisation which His Majestyfs Government proposed to entrust with the duties recommended in the First Report.He was very anxious that the Government should fully realise the kind of publicity which had been in the minds of the Committee, and that In addition to a general propaganda on behalf of Empire Goods it definitely contemplated that much the larger proportion of the  650,000 to be set aside in the first instance for ppbl1 i ty should be spent on the direct advertising of particular Xlnsa of commodity which were forthcoming.in satisfactory quality and quantity. With regard to the Executive Commission he expressed the view that the most important condider&amp;tion on which the Committee had laid emphasis was the fact that an ordinary Government Department was not the type of organisation which the Committee had contemplated but that it should be a body not subject to detailed Treasury control in its work of carrying out the Imperial Economic Committee^ recommendations.   The Committee signified their agreement with this view.Sir Algernon Firth stated that he generally agreed with the vlewswhlch Mr.&quot; McDbugall had put forward but that he doubted whether the Committee could with dignity at the moment submit a further report on the subject.   He felt that the initiative should come from the other side, and that while the Committee should be prepared   to give details   with regard to both   the Executive Commission and the publicity campaign when consulted by the Home Government they could not themselves press their views on these subjects without formal invitation.Mr. Forsyth Smith stated that he was most anxious that the Committee should&apos;have an opportunity   of laying before the Home Government its views in detail regarding a publicity campaign
campaign on behalf of Empire goods before any iwytion was taken by that Government on the First Report.    He was afvaid that there was a tendency on the part of the public, at any rate, to misapprehend the kind of campaign which had been envisaged,   A general campaign for encouraging the purchase of British goods as such was not. the only or even the most important work to be undertaken.    He felt that a supple-mentary statement might well be handed in to the Home Government at an early date emphasizing the Committees views on the subject.   Such a statement need not, of course, be for publication but merely for the information of the Home Government in coming to a decision on the First Report.Mr. Gubbt-.y stated that he felt no little perturbation at the possibility of the recommendations in the First Report being Ignored by the Home Government and action taken on line-s which the Imperial Economic Committee itself had never con-templated. The position of the Home Government was clearly to state whether they accepted the recommendations of the Committee, and if not to refer the matter back to the Committee.   He recognised that a formal reference back In a public manner might not be possible but there should be no reason why, if the Home Government were uncertain as to the nature and implications of the recommendations which the Committee had made, that they should not give the Committee a further opportunity of advising them in more detail on the subject.   He suggested that the Chairman should represent these views to the Home Government and should emphasise the feeling of  spprehension which existed lest the spirit of their recommendations should not be carried out in regard to the Executive Commission and the publicity campaign,Mr... Crawford stated that the view had been expressed that  650,600 a year for publicity purposes was excessive. This was far from being the case.   Much larger sums were spent annually by business Interests on behalf of the comparatively small objects.   He referred to the case of one firm which alone was spending  750,000 on publicity, and added that he had recently been approached by a tobacco firm with a proposi-tion to spend  75,000 in one year for the advertising of a single brand of cigarette, and that it was expected that this would increase   to  150,000 a year later.   Part of the importance of the Executive Commission would lie in the power it would have of transferring expenditure from one head of publicity to another and even to other items of expenditure, such as research or other plans which the Imperial Economic Committee have recommended.Sir Thomas Allen stated that he too regarded  650,000 on publicity as quite a small sum for the purposes In view, He knew of one firm spending  500,000 a year on one article only.   Sir Thomas further enquired whether the Chairman could give the Committee any idea whether the recommendations of the Committee In regard to the publicity campaign and the setting up of the Executive Commission were likely to be held up until the necessary legislation dealing with the marking of Empire produce had been passed.    He understoodthat
that the Ministry of Agriculture Bill was to be withdrawn end a new Bill introdweedr-xtext session by the Board of Trade. This Bill could not be introduced at the earliest before February or March 1926 and it was unlikely to be Law until some considerable time after that date.   The Government was clearly committed to an expenditure of the  1,000,000 a year on the marketing of Empire produce in the United Kingdom,   Neverthe-less if all action was to be postponed until the necessary Merchandise Marks Legislation had been passed much of the force of the recommendations contained in the First Report would be dissipated.   He recognised that expenditure on publicity and the legal requirements regarding marketing were closely related but it would be most unfortunate if the whole question were postponed until the Summer of 1926.   All that the recommendations of the Committee regarding marketing involved ms a slight extension of the present Ministry of Agriculture Bill, and if this could possibly be passed during the present session the publicity campaign would be very greatly assisted and there would then be no grounds for its delay.Other members expressed similar views.In reply to the discussioiS the Chairman stated that he would see that the views expressed by the members of the Committee were communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Government.    He suggested that an extract from the Minutes for the present Meeting should be prepared and that he should be authorised to forward this to His Majesty&apos;s Government.   He gathered that in the view of the Committee the important matters to be emphasised, were -(1) that the Committee attached very great importance to the main principles they had laid down for the Executive Commission, although they attached no great importance to the name^(2) that the most important feature of the publicity campaign which the Committee had envisaged was the advertising of specific lines of Empire goods and not a general campaign of propaganda, however important this might be as a background for the more speciflo^advertising of particular commodities; and(3) that the  sum of  650,000 a year on publicity was far from being excessive expenditure on such an object.   Forty millions of people had to be induced to change their habits.With regard to Sir Thomas Allen1s enquiry regarding Merchandise Marks Legislation, he had no information as to the views the Government adopted on this point, but he would not fail to represent the importance of very early action to enable the publicity campaign to be inaugurated as soon as possible .It was unanimously agreed that no formal resolution should be passed on the subject at the present stage but that the Chairman should be  asked to convey to His Majesty&apos;s Government the sense of the discussion v&amp;which had taken place and to hand to the Government an extract from the Minutes of the Committee on the subject,
