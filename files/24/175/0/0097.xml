Novemtaer 24 th, 1925 .The Secretary to the Executive Council of the Irish K&apos;ree state, Dublin.Sir eWith further reference to your letter of November 21st, and with reference to my earlier letter of today * s date, I am directed by the Irish Boundary Commission to say that in view of the inability of your Government to send a representative to the conference which&apos;had been arranged for today between this Commission and representatives of the Government of the Irish Eree State and the British government the proposed conference necessarily fell through;    but the Commission met this morning representatives of the British Government.      The Commissioners present informed the representatives of the British Government of their view, stated in my earlier letter,  that the resignation of Dr. MacNeill is not a valid or effectual resignation..The Commission further informed the representatives of the British Government that the Award of the Commission was in course of preparation,  and that the Commission expected to be in a position to deliver the Award at an early date,  the fixing of which would form the subject of a future di scussion.The Commission raised the question as to  the giving of preliminary information indicating the general character of the Award, at some date prior to its actual delivery to the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free state: and the question of the date at which such preliminary information should, be given was discussed r      In this connection I am directed to say that the Commission would be glad, to be enabled to make the communication proposed simultaneously to
*J j orepresentatives of the two Governments,  to neither of which, any communication respecting the nature of the Award contemplated has yet been ma.de &quot;by the Commission.The Commission considers that the early communication Of such information is desirable^ and I am directed to    suggest that it should be, made on Thursday next, November 26th.      The Commission hopes that your Government will be disposed to arrange that either- a Minister or the High Commissioner, of the Irish Free State in London should, meet the Commissioners on the date suggested for the purpose of inspecting the maps by means of which it is suggested that the information should be conveyed.I am,Sir ,Your obedient Servant, (Signed)      F .B . BO URDILLOK&quot;.Secretary to the Commission.
