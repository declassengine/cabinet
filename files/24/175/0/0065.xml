I have not, however, as yet received any further communication from you.The Commission now directs mo to say that its proceed-ings have reached a stage when it appears desirable that the Commission should have an opportunity at a comparatively early date of conferring on certain points with a representative of His Majesty5 s Government end a representative of the  Government1.
of the Irish Free State.      The points in question are -(1)    The question of fixing a convenient date for theamiivery of the Commissions Award. (2)    The procedure to be adopted with regard to thepublic at i 0 n of th e A;., ard. (5)    Certain questions concerning the publication andcustody of documents other than the Award. It has been provisionally arranged that the Commission should meet again early In the week beginning November 15th,  and the Commission trusts that Ilia Majesty&apos;s Government nay be able to maJke&apos; arrangements for such a conference as is suggested to take piaoe on Thursday November 19th. *   &quot;It is suggested that the   -conference should take place at the Commission&apos;s offices at 6 Clements Inn, London,A similar communication Is being addressed to the Secretary to the Executive Council of the Irish Free State.I am not addressing a similar communication to the Government of Northern Ireland.    In this connection I am directed to refer to the third paragraph of my letter of June 8th ana to state that in this case also the Commission proposes to leave to Hie Majesty&apos;s Government the question of making any communication to  the Government of northern Ireland,I am,    etc,(Signed)    F.B.Bouraillon.Secretary to the CommissionLt.Col.Sir M.P.A Harikey G.C CB . , Secret any to  the C ab inet,8 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,Copies of the Commission&apos;s letter of June 8th and of Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s reply thereto of July  8th, both of which are referred to in the above letter,  are annexed.,   (Annexes A and B.)
Our colleagues are. aware that a conference between representatives of His Majesty1s Government and of the Govern-ment of the Irish Free State was held on October 29th, and a summary account of what took place at that conference is being circulated to the Cabinet,   (See CP. 467(25)).      In view, however, of the decisions of the Cabinet at their meeting on October 28th, it was not possible to discuss with the representatives of the Freo State Government at that Conference the question of the date on which the Commission1s award should be delivered and of the procedure to be adopted with regard thereto.     In view of the letter now received from the Commission, however, it- appears to be necessary that a decision on this point should be reached; and we therefore propose to raise the matter again at the next, meeting of the Cabinet.     The Cabinet will also have to consider the views of Sir James Craig as expressed in a conversation with the Home Secretary, a note of which is being separately circulated.Subject to a decision on this point being reached, we are of opinion that His Hajesty1 $Government should accede to the proposal of the Commission if the Free State Government also accede to it;    and it is proposed therefore to send a despatch to the Governor-General of the Irish Free State of which a draft Is annexed (Annex C).      Meanwhile the Free State Government have been requested semi-officially to defer replying to the Commission&apos;s letter until they hear from His Maj e styles Go vernment *J.H.

Irish Boundary Commission, Knock-Na-Moe, Omagho 8th Jims,  1925.The Secretary to the Cabinet,2 Whitehall Gardens,  SoWdoSir,I am directed by the Irish Boundary Commission to forward to you the enclosed memorandum which has been drawn up by the Commission on the subject of the taking effect of the Commission&apos;?, decision when reached.The Commission would be glad to learn the view which 1?  taken by His Majesty&apos;a Government on the points dealt with in the memorandum...7vith reference to the Fourth paragraph of this memorandum I am directed to state that the Commission, while recognising that the Government of Northern Ireland is one of the &quot;governments concerned&quot; and anxious that the Interests of that Government should receive full consideration, has thought it better to confine this enquiry to the Governments representing the parties to the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland;    and to leave to His Majesty7s Government the question of making any communication to the Government of Northern Ireland *I am,Sir, etc. (Sgd.)  J.P. BOUEDILLON. Secretary to the Commission,,
IRISH BOUNDARY COffilSSION. Memorandum.,Confidential0The Irish Boundary Commission has had under consideration  -the terms of the proviso to Article 12 of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland so far as they deal with the effect of the determination by the Commission of the boundaries between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland.,The Commission understands the position to be that, under the terms of the proviso,  the boundaries as determined by the Commission become ipso facto the boundaries for the purpose of the Government of Ireland Act 1920,  and of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty, without further action on the part of the Governments or Parliaments concerned0The Article makes no provision expressly enabling the Commission to deXay the effect of Its determination, once that determination has been duly made0It appears to the Commission to be essential in the public Interest that a reasonable Interval should be secured between the announcement of any decision of the Commission determining the boundaries and the actual taking effect of that determination,-,      Such an interval will obviously be necessary in order to enable the Governments concerned to make satisfactory administrative arrangements in connection with the taking effect of the commission s decision;    and such an interval also appears desirable in order that private persons, both traders and others, may have some notice of any change of boundary directly affecting themselves.
The Commission will be glad to lsarn from the British Government and frov&quot; the Government of the Irish Free State as representing tho parties to the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty whether in their opinion the Commission itself has under the terms of the Article any implied power to postpone the effect of its determination so as to allow of such an interval, or whether further legislation -A:ill be necessary in order to secure such an intervaleThe Commission wishes to prevent any uncertainty arising as to the date of the taking effect of its decision, and feels therefore that it would be undesirable-for it to assume to act in exercise of an implied power to postpone the effect of Its decision, unless there is agreement that such power exists.The Commission considers that this question should receive timely consideration on the part of the Governments concerned so that any measures held to be necessary for the purpose of dealing with it, or of removing any doubt which may a rise with regard to it, may be taken without undue delay, and that the arousing of public anxiety on the  subject may be prevented.For this reason the Commission Is raising the question for consideration at this stage while It is still engaged in receiving evidence in Ireland on the subject of the  work  with which it is charged.The Commission Is not able at present to make a definite forecast of the date when it will bo in a position to arrive at a final decision determining the boundaries;    but-It is anticipated that after the conclusion of its sittings in Ireland for the purpose of
receiving evidence (which as at present arranged will continue till about the end of June) an interval of some months must elapse before it can be in a position to announce a decision.The Commission considers, however,  that the later stages of its work should not be so prolonged as to postpone the date of its decision beyond the end of the present year, and it is possible that the Commission5s work may be completed within four or five months of the present date.8th June,  1925,

I understand that since that despatch was written, the Irish Pree State Government have received, as His Ma majesty&apos;s Government have received, a letter from the Commission suggesting that both Governments should send representatives to a meeting with the Commission on Sovomber 19th.3c       It appears to His Majesty&quot;s Government that it nay be more convenient to deal with the question of the date of the Commissionrs determination by conference, at any rate in the first instance, rather than by despatch;  and they would there-fore propose to reply to the letter from the Commission that they will make arrangements, so far as they are concerned,  for the Conference suggested by the Commission to take place on Thursday, November 19th, at lloSO a*m* at the Commission^ Office at 6 Clementls Inn.      Before so replying, however, they would be glad to bo informed what answer your Ministers propose to send to the letter which has been addressed to them04.       It appears to His Majostyfs Government that it may be convenient that more than one representative of each Government should attend the Conference;  and they propose therefore to enquire in their reply whether the Commission would have any objection to the representation of His Majestyfs Government at the Conference by a &quot;number of representatives * not exceeding six.

Furthermore, it appc-arc desirable to His Majesty1^ Government that the questions to he considered at the Conforonce should have teen jointly discussed prior to the Conference, between representatives of the two Govern-ments concerned, and I am to suggest therefore,  for tho consideration of your Ministers, that, if they propose to attend the Conference,  a meeting between their reprosent-atives and the representatives of His Majestyrs Government should bo held at this Office at 3.0 p.m.&apos;the 18th November.I have etc.,His ExcellencyT.H.
