CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government. ] Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1925. &quot;SECRET. Copy No.CP. 499 (25).CABINET.[Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.]BRITISH COMMITMENTS IN REGARD TO IRAQ.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for information, the following statementsetting out the existing British commitments in regard to Iraq......   - L. S. A.Colonial Office,November 27, 1925.British Commitments in regard to Iraq.IN November 1914, Sir Percy Cox wrote to the various Arab chiefs in the Gulf region (including Ibn Saud, ruler of Nejd, and the Chiefs of Muscat, Koweit and Mohammerah), assuring them that in the event of our success, Basra &quot; would never again be allowed to be subject to Turkish authority.&quot;2. The proclamation published after our occupation of Basra on the 22nd November, 1914, made no such specific promise, but it stated that the British flag had been established &quot; under which you will enjoy the benefits of liberty and justice both in regard to your religious and your secular affairs.&quot;3. In December 1914, Sir Percy Cox asked leave to announce definitely that our occupation of Basra was permanent. He was not permitted to so do, but His Majesty&apos;s Government raised no objection to his letting it be understood m conversation &quot; that places where we assumed control with the co-operation of the inhabitants may in all circumstances count on our future protection against the Turks.&quot; &quot; &apos; ,4. In February 1915, Lord Hardinge, then Viceroy of India, visited Basra and informed a deputation there that &quot; w&quot;e may be permitted to&apos; indulge a very confident assurance that henceforth a more benign administration will bring back to Iraq that prosperity to which her rich potentialities give her so&apos; clear a title.&quot;5. The whole of Iraq, including the three vilayets of Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, was included in the area in respect of which Sir H. McMahon, in the course of the correspondence that preceded the Arab revolt, informed the Sherif of Mecca (now King Hussein of the Hejaz) in October 1915 that His Majesty&apos;s Government were &quot; prepared to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs.&quot; It is true that we made certain reservations in regard to British interests in the Basra and Baghdad vilayets, but they do not affect the question of Arab &quot; independence &quot; vis-a-vis the Turks.6. The Proclamation issued by General Maude on the occupation of Baghdad (March 1917) contained no absolute pledge that Baghdad would never revert to Turkish rule, but its general sense certainly pointed in that direction. The people of Baghdad were informed that we had come, not as conquerors, but as &quot; liberators,&quot; and they were invited to co-operate with our Political Officers &quot; so that you may he united with your kinsmen in the north, south, east and west in realising the aspirations of your race.&quot;7. Mr. Lloyd. George, in a speech on the 5th January, 1918, setting out the &quot;war aims&quot; of the British Government, declared that &quot;Arabia, Armenia, Mesopotamia; Syria and Palestine are, in our judgment, entitled to a recognition of their separate national conditions.&quot; He added that it would be impossible to restore the territories in question to their former sovereignty.[13874] &apos; b
8. In November 1918 the British and French Governments published a joint Declaration regarding their policy in Syria and Mesopotamia, They announced their objects to be &quot;the complete and definite liberation of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks and the establishment of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the initiative and free choice of the native populations.&quot; In order to give effect to this policy the two Governments were agreed in encouraging the establishment of native administrations; far from wishing to impose particular institutions on the people concerned, their one wish was to ensure by their effective support and assistance the proper working of such administrations as the people might choose for themselves,9. Under the Treaty of Versailles (June 1919) His Majesty&apos;s Government became parties to the Covenant of the League of Nations, Article 22 of which lays down that certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire (Iraq was obviously intended to be one of them, though not specifically mentioned) &quot; have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised, subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory, until such time as they are able to stand alone.&quot;10. At the San Remo Conference in April 1920 the British Government accepted from the Principal Allied Powers the mandate for Iraq under the terms of the Article quoted in the preceding paragraph.11. Article 94 of the Treaty of Sevres (August 1920) definitely laid down that Mesopotamia constituted one of the areas contemplated in the above-quoted passage from the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Treaty of Sevres has, of course, never been ratified, though it was signed by ourselves and Turkey, as well as by the other Allied Powers.12. The first draft of the mandate for Iraq was submitted to the Council of the League in December 1920. The text was laid before Parliament in March 1921. The Preamble recited the terms of Article 22 of the Covenant and of Article 94 of the Treaty of Sevres, and proceeded to lay down the conditions under which advice and assistance would be rendered by the mandatory Power.13. Early in 1921 the whole question of policy in the Middle East was reviewed by the Cabinet, and it was decided to place the control of the mandated countries under a single department, viz., the Colonial Office. The first step taken by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Churchill) was to hold a conference at Cairo with the principal British officials of the territories concerned. The object of the conference was to devise some form of constitution for Iraq that would enable us to reduce our expenditure while still fufilling our obligations. The result was thai the Emir Feisal, son of the King of the Hejaz, was encouraged to proceed to Iraq to press his candidature for the rulership of the country. He was not officially invited by the British Government to undertake the task, but he was given to understand that his success would be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and there can be little doubt that the readiness with which he was adopted by the people of Iraq was due to the general belief that his candidature was backed by Great Britain.14. In July 1921 the Iraq Council of Ministers passed a unanimous resolution declaring Feisal King of Iraq. On the 23rd August he was crowned at Baghdad in the presence of the British High Commissioner and Commander-in-chief. In a proclamation issued at the time of the coronation the High Commissioner formally recognised King Feisal on behalf of the British Government.15. His Majesty King George sent Feisal a congratulatory message at the time of his coronation, which contained the following passage: &quot; The treaty which will shortly be concluded between us to consecrate the alliance into which we entered during the dark days of the war will, I am confident, enable me to fulfil my solemn obligations by inaugurating an era of peace and renewed prosperity for Iraq.&quot;16. The negotiations for a treaty with Iraq were initiated in the autumn of 1921. After prolonged discussions, a Treaty was eventually signed on the 10th October, 1922. The text was presented to Parliament immediately after its signature.Article I of this Treaty reads as follows  &quot; At the request of His Majesty the King of Iraq His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government undertakes, subject to the provisions of this Treaty, to provide the State of Iraq with such advice and assistance as may be required during the period of the present Treaty.&quot;
f f c*Article VII reads : &quot; His Britannic Majesty undertakes to provide such support and assistance to the armed forces of His Majesty the King of Iraq as may from time to time be agreed by the High Contracting Parties.&quot;Article VIII reads : &quot; No territory in Iraq shall be ceded or leased or in any way placed under the control of any Foreign Power.&quot;17. After the signature of the Treaty, King leisal sent a friendly message to His Majesty King George, to which the following reply was returned :  &quot; I deeply appreciate your message and cordially reciprocate your good wishes. My earnest hope is that the friendly association of our peoples will lead to the establishment in Iraq of a prosperous and independent Arab kingdom.&quot;At the same time, Sir Percy Cox was authorised to make a public announcement in which he referred to the &quot; deep obligations &quot; into which the British Government has entered towards Iraq, and undertook, subject to the necessary conditions being fulfilled, to promote the admission of Iraq into the League of Nations.18. On the 23rd January, 1923, Lord Curzon made a speech at the Lausanne Conference in support of Iraq&apos;s claim to the Vilayet.of Mosul, in the course of which he made the following statement: -&quot; The British Government are under a three-fold pledge : firstly, to the Arab Nation, to whom they promised that they should not be returned to Turkish rule; secondly, to the Arab King, who has been elected by the whole country, including Mosul, and with whom we have entered into obligations; and, thirdly, to the League of Nations, without whose consent we cannot abandon our mandate over a large portion of the mandated territory.&quot;19. The Anglo-Iraq Treaty was subsequently modified on the 30th April, 1923. by a protocol in the following terms : &quot; It is understood between the High Contracting Parties that, notwith-standing the provisions of Article 18, the present Treaty shall terminate upon Iraq becoming a member of the League of Nations and in any case not later than four years from the ratification of peace with Turkey. Nothing in this Protocol shall prevent a fresh agreement from being concluded with a view to regulate the subsequent relations between the High Contracting Parties; and negotiations for that object shall be entered into between them before the expiration of the above period.&quot;20.   On the 25th March, 1924, the Subsidiary Agreements contemplated in the Treaty were concluded.Article I of the Military Agreement reads as follows : &quot; The two Governments recognise the principle that the Government of Iraq shall at the earliest possible date, provided it shall not be later than four years from the date of the conclusion of this agreement, accept full responsi-bility both for the maintenance of internal order and for the defence of Iraq from external aggression. With this end in view, it is agreed that the material support and assistance now being rendered by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government to the Government of Iraq shall be progressively reduced with all possible expedition.&quot;Article VIII reads as follows : &quot; The Iraq Army shall only be employed in the interests of Iraq and the two Governments hereby agree that neither Government shall undertake any military operations for the maintenance of internal order or for the defence of Iraq from external aggression without previous consultation and agreement with the other Government. The Iraq Government shall not be entitled to the assistance of any forces maintained or controlled by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government against or for the suppression of any external aggression or any civil disturbance or armed rising, which shall, in the opinion of the High [13874] B 2
Commissioner, have been provoked or occasioned by action taken or policy pursued by the Iraq Government contrary to the advice or express wishes of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;Article VII contains the following provision : &quot; The Iraq Government shall not be entitled to assistance from His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government as contemplated in Article VIII should they fail to give effect to any recommendation of the High Commissioner regarding the movements and dispositions of the Iraq Army given in virtue of this Article.&quot;Article IX reads as follows : &quot; In the event of operations being undertaken in which forces maintained or controlled by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government are to take part, the command of the combined forces shall, subject to any special arrangement which may be accepted by both parties, be vested in a British military commander selected for the purpose.&quot;Article XII reads as follows : &quot; The Iraq Government agree that, in the event of the said forces (i.e., the armed forces maintained or controlled by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Iraq) undertaking military operations&quot; in Iraq for the purpose of assisting the Iraq Government to repel external aggression or to suppress civil corn-motion, the King of Iraq will, on the request of the High Commissioner, proclaim martial law in all such parts of Iraq as may be affected by such aggression or commotion, and entrust its administration to the Air Officer Commanding, or such other officer or officers as the Air Officer Commander may appoint, and will further secure the passing of the necessary measure of indemnification for all acts done by the armed forces under martial law upon the subsequent re-establishment of civil government.&quot;21. On the 28th July, 1924, Mr. J. H. Thomas, who was then Secretary of: State for the Colonies, authorised the High Commissioner, Baghdad, to make it public that certain language used in the House of Commons (to the effect that the rider appended by the Iraq Assembly to their acceptance of the Treaty did not entail any fresh responsibility upon His Majesty&apos;s Government) was not intended to imply that any modification of policy in regard to the Turco-Iraq frontier was contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who had no intention whatever of abandoning their support of the frontier claim which had just been brought forward on behalf of Iraq at Constantinople.22. On the 27th September, 1924, the Council of the League of Nations accepted the Iraq Treaty and subsidiary instruments as giving effect to the provisions of Article XXII of the Covenant on the understanding, among other things, that at the end of the period for which the Treaty of Alliance had been concluded the Council of the League should, if Iraq had not meanwhile been admitted to the League, be invited to decide what further measures were required to give effect to that article.23. The Treaty, Protocol and Subsidiary Agreements were duly ratified by the British and Iraq Governments on the 19th December, 1924.24. On the 3rd September, 1925, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in pursuance of a Cabinet decision of the 7th August, 1925, made the following announcement in the course of his opening statement before the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva : &quot;In their conclusions the Commissioners put the duration of the period during which Iraq will require external advice and support as about twenty-five years. The figure is obviously a tentative one, and no one can seriously suggest that the precise period during which a State can consolidate its position and develop its resources can be definitely laid down beforehand. In any case, Hi* Majesty&apos;s Government wishes to make it clear that, in accepting responsibility towards the League of Nations for the continuance of a stable and progressive Government in Iraq, it is in no sense departing from its declared policy of usin^; its good offices to secure the admission of Iraq to membership of the League as soon as possible.
&quot; Subject to these explanations, His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared, before-the expiration in 1928 of the present Treaty, which was formally approved last year by the Council, to give effect to the provision contained in the Protocol of that Treaty by replacing it by a treaty of longer duration, which will safe-guard throughout the Kingdom of Iraq those conditions of stable government and reasonable consideration for local interests subject to which the Commis-sioners consider that the territory south of the Brussels line should continue in its present union with Iraq, and is prepared to continue its responsibility towards the League of Nations in this respect until such time, within the limit suggested by the Commissioners, as the Council of the League is clearly convinced that those conditions of stability which the Commissioners postulate are definitely and permanently secured.&quot;25. On the 3rd September, 1925, the following communique, which had been approved by the Cabinet, was issued to the Press: &quot; The policy announced on behalf of the British Government at the special meeting of the Council of the League of Nations on the 3rd September, viz., the continued co-operation of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the Iraq Government after the expiration of the existing Treaty, will not involve any additional Imperial expenditure beyond what had been previously contemplated. Indeed, His Majesty&apos;s Government have every reason to hope that such expenditure will continue to show a steady downward trend year by year.&quot;
