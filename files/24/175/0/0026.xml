3 fiIS   DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIO MAJESTY fS GOVERNMENT.0RET. 0 A B I 2T. E T.pEMPLOYMENT OP DISABLED EX-SERVIOE MEN. 6(85).---------------------&apos;-----------**-----Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1,     I have been asked by the Kirtg&apos;s Roll National Oounoil to secure the passing of   a House of Commons Resolution that grant-aided Local Authorities should confine their contracts to firms on the Kingfb Roll,  that is, to firms who have given the requisite undertaking to employ a specified proportion of disabled men,2,     The King&apos;s Roll National Council ie an advisory body, presided over by Lord Haig, and containing representatives of both Houses of Parliament,  employers, trade unions and the British Legion, which watches over the steps taken to find employment for disabled men.     They take the view, which I share, that if we are to avoid the very troublesome alternative of compulsion (proposed last Session and this in Bills- promoted by the British Legion), we must do our utmost to promote the success of the voluntary system, as represented by the King!s Roll, Government contracts, with unimportant exceptions, have sinoe 1921 been confined to firms on the Roll?    a number of Looal Authorities have adopted the same rule or give   a preference to firms on the Roll,   This arrangement has been found to be effective in bringing firms on the Roll and it is with the objeot of applying it to all Local Authorities that the Council   make the request mentioned above.   There are at present on the Roll 2P,000 firms, employing about 360,000 disabled men;    these numbers are substantial, but there is obviously room for a large increase before the ground can be said to be completely covered.
3.     I fear, however, it is not praotioahle to do exactly what the Council suggest.    Grants are paid to Local Authorities in aid of specific activities and it would be of , questionable policy to subject these grants to extraneous oonditions such as that new proposed.     The proper way tc impose such a condition 1b by legislation,    a House of Commons Resolution on such a point could not be enforced against a recaloitrant authority and might indeed be objected to in principle by Looal Authorities as an invasion of their rights.4.     At the same time there is, I think,  a way of proceeding by House of commons Resolution which is not open to these objections and would be of substantial assistance towards the desired end,    as I have stated, Government contracts are in praotice confined almost exclusively to firms on the Rc&amp;U. This praotioe might very properly be embodied in a House of Commons Resolution, which would then follow the precedent of the Fair Wages Resolution (see Appendix).     That Resolution relates only to   wages in connection with Government contracts but has served as a model for the Fair Wages clauses now generally adopted by Looal Authorities and others.      in the same way, a Resolution with regard to the KingTs Roll, though dealing only with Government oontraots,  would,  I feel sure; lead to a wide extension of the principle among those Local Authorities who have not so far seen their way to adopt it. 5.     I ask for authority therefore to out down for the Autumn Session a Resolution in the following terms. -&quot;Resolved - that in the opinion of this House, It is the duty of the Government in all Government oontraots to make provision for the employment to/the
the fullest possible extent of disabled ex-aervioe men and to this end,  to oonfine suoh contracts save in exceptional circumstances to employers enrolled on the King&apos;s national Roll.&quot; 6.     In order that some publicity may   be given to the question,  it is desirable that there should be   a debate on it.     I think it would suffice if the debate took place some evening at       15 p.m. and if it were brought forward by a Private Member in Private Members&apos; time, and supported by the Government.    If that is impossible, I think Government time should be sacrificed to the extent of one evening^ debate for the   purpose.(Intld.) A.  S.-M,Ministry of Labour. 12th October, 1925.
APPENDIX. FAIR WAGES RESOLUTION.I.    ORIGINAL RESOLUTION OF FEBRUARY. I89X.&quot;Resolved * that- in the opinion of this House, it is the duty of the Government in all Government contracts to make prevision against the evils recently disclosed before the Sweating Committee, to Insert such conditions as may prevent the abuse arising from sub-letting, and to make every effort to secure the payment of such wages as are generally accepted as current in each trade for competent workers&quot;.11 *       RESOLUTION OP .MARCH,  1909.&quot;That, in the opinion of the Roubs, the Pair WagesClauses in Government contracts should be ao amended as toprovide as follows:      The contractor shall, under the penaltyof a fine or otherwise, pay rates of wages and observe hoursof labour not less favourable than those commonly recognised by employers and trade societies (or, In the absence of suchrecognised wages and hours, those whioh in practice prevailamongst good employers ) In the trade in the district where thework is   serried out.
