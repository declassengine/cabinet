COAL.SIR A. NIMMO thought that things were a little steadier than they had been.    It was quite evident that the coal industry was coming increasingly to the rescue of the iron and steel trades,  and presumably also the shipbuilding and engineering? and,  ay he had frequently said, until we could get these industries stimulated, there was not a great deal of hope for general industrial expansion.   Last week Sir William Larke,  speaking for the iron and steel trades at the Coal Commission, said they had now a new field for competing with the world prices now prevailing, and that view was shared by others in those trades. It was gratifying to know that. But of course,  in Itself,  the coal industry at the moment was in a gravely non-economic position and he thought it would be found that the subsidy was growing. Prices were still falling, but they seemed to be inclined to steady, because there were distinct indications that we were beginning to hold foreign competition in coal.Sir Adam was one of those who had always been against the payment of a subsidy to any industry, and as long as it went on it must increase inefficiency,  and could not secure a healthy condition for the general industries of the country.   How the situation was going to be tackled in May when the crisis develops - as it was bound to develop - he did not know, having regard to the existing factors that were operating.    It seemed that in some way or other we should have to go back to such conditions of employment of our labour as would put us on a reasonably competing basis with the other countries with which we had to compete in coal.    iive might try to evade that in this country for a more or leas indefinite period, but ultimately we could not do so if we   were to employ our people and carry on our industries.    He thought there would never be a satisfactory outlook upon the coal industry, in particular, unless it was understood that Its labour difficulties did not naturally arise from within the industry itself.   They did not come up from the general body of men; they had been created, particularly in recent years,  from out-side.    There had been a very strong attempt to force the industry in certain directions so as to destroy It in the hands of those who have been owning it, and he hoped that those who  were responsible for administering the interests of the country would look at the problem from that angle and make up their minds that it was no good trying expedients which were not getting down to the foundation of things. Between this and May we had time for mental preparation as well as for preparation of the resources of the country.    Coal owners had not the least fear that if they were left alone they could carry on this industry in the spirit of progress, in just the same way as they did up to 1913.IRON AND STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR wa3 glad to be able to report that in the Sheffield steel trade and the engineers&apos; tool trade
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD).there was a decided improvement, not only in the home trade but also in export business. The Australian trade was quite good, but there was great difficulty in shipping. Business with South America had very much improved: there we were picking up a good deal of the German trade. It wag. also found that, through stringency of money in Germany, a great many of the selling organisations of the Germans in European countries and South America and elsewhere, were breaking down. There were five or six cases at the present time where the old German selling organisations could not be maintained on account of financial   difficulties and they were breaking up, and some of their best customers were coming to British houses,MR. DORM AN   wrotei-        &quot;The production of pig iron in September amounted to 448,700 tons,compared with 444,500 tons in August, and 569,200 tons in September 1924. There were 129 furnaces in blast at the end of the month, a net reduction of 7 compared with the number in blast at the beginning of the month, 3 having been put into blast and 10 having been damped down or blown out.&quot;The production of steel ingots and castings amounted to 640,100 tons, compared with 447,100 tons in August (when production was affected by the August holidays) and 645,000 tons in September 1924.&quot;There is a slight improvement in general trade conditions, and Works are, I think a little busier. America has placed orders in this country for pig iron,but the tonnage involved is too small to really affect the general pig iron position.&quot;The tone of the Steel Trade is better - there being more enquiries, but prices remain at an absolutely uneconomic level, due to the fact that owing to the restricted output, costs are very much higher than the prices which are being obtained.&quot;The Black and Galvanised Sheet Trade is still very strong indeed, practically the whole of the Plants in the country are working at full capacity, and Makers are exceedingly well held.&quot;Whilst there is no material change in the Wire Trade, more enquiries are reported.   The Continental Makers, however, appear to be taking most of the orders that come along.&quot;Most Constructional Engineering forks are fairly busy, several contracts having recently been placed in this country. These have only been obtained, however, in face of severe competition from abroad.&quot;Makers generally still view with apprehension the general position of the Trade, in spite of the optimistic reports which are being circulated.&quot;MR. .BAKER    wrote:-&quot;During the past month the outlook in the Iron and Steel Industry has remained very gloomy, and the only possibility of trade improvement is in the increase of crops in Europe and America,   Both the Increased wheat crop and cotton crop give the growers something to sell, and when they have sold enables them to buy products that this country makes.
IRON AND STEEL  (CONTD.) .&quot;The- subsidy given to the Coal Trade is tending to reduce the cost of coal to the steel maker and enabling him to reduce his costs.&quot;The Sliding Scale which affects the majority of workers in the heavy steel trade shows an average price of  8.11.0 per ton which carries with it a reduction in wages of 5 per cent, off the Scale and reduces the Scale to 32-1 per cent, above base rate; and as there was an increase of 11^ per cent, in the Scale in 1914.  this means that the wages of the major portion of the men in the heavy iron and steel trade are only 21-J- per cent, above what they were in 1914, whereas the cost of living is 76 points up.&quot;The ordinary capital of Coal, Iron and Steel, and Engineering Companies reached its lowest point of 60.5 per cent, of its nominal value on 30th September.&quot;As contrasted with Britain, the iron and steel industry of the United States of America Is Increasingly prosperous. This statement is borne out by the Report of the U.S. Steel Trust, the earnings and dividends of which for the third quarter of the year were as follows:July, 13,909,000 dols.  (last year 10,430,000 dols .) J August, 14,399,000 dols,  (last year 10,108,000 dols.); September, 14 , 093 , 000 dols.  (last year 10,181,000 dols.); Total 42,400,000 dols.  (last year 30,718,000 dols.). Net income, 28,482,000 dols.Quarterly dividends; Preferred stock if per cent. Common Stock, \\ per cent., and an extra ^ per cent,&quot;it is reported that the L. &amp; N.E. Rly.Co., have so altered their specification for the supply of steel that not only have the goods supplied to be manufactured in Great Britain but the materials from which those goods are made must be manufactured in this country.&quot;An important, but probably controversial, speech was made by Mr. H.J,Skelton at the Quarterly Meeting of the London Iron and Steel Exchange on 20th October on &quot;British Iron and Steel Problems&quot; in the course of which he stated:&apos;There should be a ruthless scrapping of obsolete plants and of all works situated in uneconomic situations.   An absolute specialisation in production - two or three works only to roll railYvay rails; three or four to roll plates,  and a similar number to roll heavy bars and sections - and the sheet and tinplato trades should be concentrated in fewer hands.    If they did not scrap well-nigh one-third of the existing plants in the near future  .. force majeure would do it - and probably before two years were past.   Many of our largest mills would not bear the acid test of solvency today, whatever they might show on paper. The need for team work, conference, and, above all, action, was imperative.   We were on the threshold of disaster, and he would say to the country at large -Take action, do It now.&apos;&quot;it is reported that two blast furnaces are lighting up on Tees-side.&quot;
CONFIDENTIALTEXTILES: COTTONCOL. SEDDON BROWN said that there had been a very severe drop both in American and Egyptian growths of cotton, and this had caused everyone to wonder whether prices were at the bottom or not. There had been a strong feeling in Lancashire that if we got American cotton on the basis of l/- a lb. stability would be attained.    This week American cotton was nearly down to 9d, arid the only result so far had been that many merchants were wondering if it was going much lower.    It was obvious that  a cheaper price for the raw material would enable our purchasers throughout the world to buy a greater yardage for the same amount of money, and that would be likely to be very soon reflected in Lancashire, and we might be going to have better times.    The Egyptian looms, which had probably about 18,&quot;: of their spindles stopped,  chiefly affecting Bolton and that area, were now practically on full time.    The American section or the coarse count section was still working short time, and the figures compiled from the production and sale of the whole number of mills did not yet justify an increase of hours worked, .Certainly, however,  there was a more optimistic feeling developing throughout the whole trade,    The trouble in Syria and in China had affected the trade again very much during the last few weeks- but in spite of that there was a certain amount of optimism developing, and there appeared to be ground for it.The Manchester Chamber of Commerce had drawn the attention of the Board of Trade to the advantage given to Belgium and Austria as regards import duties into Germany.Both these countries were entitled to import Into Germany a yardage up to counts 47 to the extent of l  million kilogs per annum at reduced rates of duty..   The trade in this country were alarmed at that, but felt certain that our Government would, under the most favoured nation clause, be able to get it put right.    In the meantime, however, it was putting us at a serious   disadvantage with our coarse counts.The President of the Board of Trade observed that we &quot;were entitled to most favoured treatment under our Treaty with Germany, and had already made representations to the German Government In this matter.    There was always, however, the possibility that an arrangement might be made by another country in a Treaty &quot;which, - though extended to us under the most favoured nation clause of our own Treaty - was specially advantageous to that country because of its special interest in the particular class of trade in question.MR. JUDSON observed that as Col. Seddon Brown had said, cotton had dropped considerably in price, and he himself thought it would come down further yet, because more cotton had been grown this year than ever before, so far as we were aware ,    There were record crops in America, Egypt, India, Africa,; and wherever cotton was grown.    But short time working was continuing and no more trade was being done. In pre-war days, with a 16,000,000 bale crop of American cotton,  a 5b-l hour week was run in all sections.    To-day, full time was a 48 hour week, but only 39-! hours were being worked. It seemed that unless full time working came out of this crop the operatives would be no better off, but there would be ain li O
iTi q r-j3 &apos;() jTEXTILES; COTTON  (CONTD.) .big carry-over of cotton from this crop to the next year.   The operatives were anxiously awaiting the day when they could go on full time again, for they had had five years of short time, and in some instances suffering had been acute.   There seemed to be the fear in the minds of some of the work people now, that if the employers could work short time profitably, It might result in almost permanent short time, to the disadvantage of the operatives&apos;.SIR W. CLARE LEES wrote:-&quot;The continued fall In the price of Raw Cotton has naturally kept the flow of orders coming into Manchester on a smaller scale than would have been the oase had prices kept constant.&quot;Nevertheless a oontinued stream of small orders keeps filtering through aid has maintained the trade in much the same position as was the case a month ago.&quot;There can be little doubt, that after a time when prices have settled down, the lower levels must conduce to a larger trade.   Not only will the purchasing power of the World represent a larger volume, but buyers must feel that levels are on a safer foundation than they have been for many years past.&quot;There are two dangers in the present position.   The first is that with a plentiful supply of American Cotton the tendency will be to leave Empire and outside growths on one side.   I do hope that after all our labours to increase the growth of Cotton within the Empire that a deliberate and determined effort will be made to use all such cotton, and not to depress this movement by the feeling that whenever we have a good crop of American Cotton, Empire Cotton goes to the wall.&quot;The other danger is one which time alone can prove.   It is this - that the Increased supply of American Cotton will tend to diminish the consumption of Indian Cotton and that the disparits? in price between the two may be very much widened.   Last season the difference was not great.   If the difference in relative prices between Indian and American cotton becomes accentuated it would undoubtedly increase the difficulties of Lancashire in the sale of grey shirtings in the East, and if it meant that the Continent continued to use Indian Cotton with a much wider disparity in price between it and American, it would increase our competition in finished goods, unless we were able to develop a trade in lower grade cloth made of the same type of material,&quot;TEXTILES;    wfOOL.MR. ANDREWS recalled that last time he reported that things were a little more hopeful, but it was then too early to say ?;hether there was a genuine expansion in trade or whether it was only a temporary movement.   Since then the expansion had developed, and there was certainly very much
TEXTILES ; WOOL  (CONTD.) .better trade to-day - not merely a better feeling - than there had been at any time during the last six months.   Wool prices had advanced about lOf. during the last month in Australia.   For the first three months, July 1st to September 30th, the British demand for wool had been very poor indeed.    Our share of the total purchases was only about 9%t whereas the purchases for France were nearly b of. of the total offered. The  reason was, of course, that France having a very good trade was encouraged to buy wool, knowing that she could sell the good.3, but we being de-pressed naturally did not want to increase our stocks. France purchased that wool at the rate of about 102 Francs. Yesterday the rate had been 1160   We. should have that competition now,-   They were still paying the same wages with the Franc at 116 as when it was at 102, and this would increase their selling facilities as compared with ours.In this country there was certainly an expansion in every branch of the trade.   We had rather more mills running, certainly more spindles and some more looms running. The tendency that Col. tfilley mentioned (see the section &quot;Trade in the United States&quot;) which was very prevalent in the United States of America, that is to carry what they call &quot;low inventories&quot;s small stocks, had been developing a good deal in the woollen trade here also, and there was no doubt that we had now reduced our stocks to the lowest possible point at which we could work, and there would be a gradual replacement from now onwards ,   Money had certainly gone back into the banks, and we had facilities now that we had not a few months ago.   It.seemed that we could look forward to two or three months, at any rate, of distinctly improving trade as compared with the last six months.MR. SUTCLIFFE SMITH said that unemployment and short time working showed a progressive improvement, and he agreed with all the speakers who had said that there was more optimism. He did not quite agree that the worsted trade was very much better; there was certainly more trade but it was not reflected in the number of looms running, which were only Sbfi of the total, and these were still not well employed although there was a distinct improvement.   Manu-facturers had made great efforts to push their trade by inducing the home distributing houses to deal more in British fabrics.    He had himself spoken at meetings, dinners at Wembley, and one at the Chamber of Trade in London,   They were glad to see the Government circular suggesting a British Shopping&apos; Week, and he had pointed out at the various meetings he had attended that by pushing British goods people would be finding employment for British workmen, whilst by employing the French they would simply be putting our own men and women out of work whilst they themselves were taxed to pay the doles.   As a result, for the first time, the retail trades had decided to appoint a committee to co-operate with the Bradford Chamber of Commerce to see what could be done to get more British fabrics shown and pushed in the shops.   Mr. Sutcliffe Smith thought that other trades might usefully take similar action; our home market was after all the best and most profitable market w e - had.
TEXTILES:_WOOL (CONTD).Aa to the main reasons for tho change from pessimism to optimism, ho believed there were four - cheaper raw materials in both cotton and wool, a big wheat crop, increasing production costs of our competitors,  and .1 greater chance of world peace.    As to the third, Italy, for Instance, was now finding difficulty in getting labour to cope with her orders, and there seemed to be some hopefulness for us there. He would, however, like to emphasise again that to get our production costs on to a world competitive basis - and it was the world trade we wanted - we must have lower national and municipal taxation.As regards our export trade in the worsted Industry, South America was fairly active, and notwithstanding the dl3-disturbed conditions in China we were still booking some   g ood business there. Orders for India and the Continent were rather disappointing,,   Canadian buyers who had been over here had bought pretty freely.There was another point which he wanted to emphasise, and this was the desirability in public speaking of striking a more optimistic note as to our trade position, because the pessimism that had appeared In our newspapers and in public speakers&apos; remarks had dons us harm abroad. Optimistic speaking had a reflex action on our export trade.RUBBER.MR. BIRLEY wrotej-&quot;The Rubber Trade continues to be fairly well employed for the time of the year.nThose firms which have the misfortune to be compelled to buy spot or near rubber are very badly hit, and the trade is earnestly hoping that some extra relief of restriction under the Stevenson Scheme may be decided upon by the Government beyond the periodical quarterly revision. Any extra relief granted would take some time to make any material difference,  and it is feared that the busy season for the trade will find extremely short supplies of raw material.&quot;The tyre manufacturers are well employed.&quot;Surgical goods are very quiet with the exception of the seasonal rush for Hot water Bottles,&quot;The iviechanical goods side is decidedly quiet in goods required by Mill Furnishers,&quot;Waterproof garments have shown a good deal of falling off.&quot;It is generally about the quietest time of the year, but on the whole manufacturers have little to complain of,  except those mentioned above who are.3hort of raw rubber.&quot;
s 7 aPOTTERY.MR. HOLLINS observed that the stoneware trade was still in a bad way, particularly in Scotland; the English stoneware trade was a little better than the Scotch.General earthenware had improved during the last month, but it was to be expected about this time of the year, particularly in the home trade, that there should be some diffidence amongst employers in saying what would be the outlook in the early part of next year. Owing to the boom in the building trade, sanitary earthenware and sanitary fireclay were doing exceptionally well, and coke ovens were being built. English china was still in a poor way.    One would be inclined to think that the English China manufacturers were feeling competition from the very much improved quality and   finish, design and decoration, by the firms who previously made a third grade ware.Generally speaking, exports &quot;were keeping up fairly well.   There was a slight fall - nothing to speak of - and the home trade was fair,    imports were, at the same time, increasing; it was a question how far that was due to manufacturers leaving the production of cheap lines for the manufacture of better class products.CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY said he was glad to be able to report this time, that while there had been no material change in the volume of trade done by the chemical industry, there was a distinctly better tone.He wished to confirm a remark of Sir Arthur Balfour&apos;s about the selling organisations of Germany breaking down. They were, at least, failing to function effectively; and it might also be mentioned that in the ohemical Industry in Germany there were 37,000 men on strike resisting a proposal to reduce wages by only &amp;Z.   But there was a grave increase of foreign competition in our own country from Holland and Belgium. Our fertiliser manufacturers in this country were now actually closing their works in some cases, and the outlook at present was that the British farmer would probably have to depend entirely on Continental superphosphate for his land in the comparatively near future.Another serious instance was the competition from Holland in sulphuric acid.   They were now offering it in large quantities at prices considerably below the English cost of production,  and this was an attack on what might be termed our fundamental commodity In chemistry. For the first time America had become a serious exporter of chemicals, notably fertilisers and dyes. They were attacking our overseas markets,  with success in some instances.
SHIPBUILDING.SIR JAMES LITHGOW said   he would wish to speak of his own experience since January.    He was responsible for five ship-yards of normal size, which specialised mainly in ocean-going cargo steamers.    Since January they had received amongst the five yards nine contracts.    Of these nine, five were dependent on facilities being given by the Trade Facilities Committee, and in each case the facilities were refused. That left them with four, three of /.hich were now complete. They had one In hand.    Thus it would be quite wrong for him personally to give the Council any impression of prosperity in the shipbuilding trade, and he knew that his experience was similar to that of the trade generally.    Car-go ship-building was practically dead, but a certain amount of special tonnage was being built, a3 to the progress of which Sir Alan Anderson had given some figures (see the section &quot;Shipping&quot;).In connection with this feeling of optimism which was certainly spreading over many business circles just now, he thought It was necessary to keep some sense of proportion. Sir Alan Anderson particularly mentioned the Improvement in the amount of tonnage laid down in this country last quarter but that amount was only 260,000 tons in the quarter, which was really very poor indeed.   Personally,  it seemed to him that the optimism should be of a very relative character; things were not so bad as people felt a few months ago they might be, but there was no ground,  so far as he could gather - certainly not as-regards shipbuilding or any trade he was connected with - for any feeling that we were by any means In for a period of prosperity,An important point was, that raw material was cheaper. Raw materials in many cases were down to practically pre-war prices, and he submitted that this held an important lesson for us, namely that it was quite impossible to look forward to prosperity in this country with other costs in many cases double what they were pre-war.    The world level of costs was gradually coming down somewhere approaching pre-war, and with the possible exception&apos; of America, where they were specially favourably situated, competing countries would drop to these same kinds of levels.While he strongly agreed that there was no use giving the impression to foreigners that this oountry was done by any means, he submitted that, while we might keep a stout heart,  it was quite wrong for the Government or public men generally to go on the assumption that all was well with us.GENERAL TRAPS AND BANKING.MR. TENNANT handed in the reports from the branches of the Westminster Bank (Extract given at the end of this section). He was glad to say that there was undoubtedly a much more hopeful feeling generally, except in the shipbuilding trade, which appeared to be in a bad condition. The reports were probably based to a large extent on the more generally prevailing feeling
GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING (CONTD).of optimism, &quot;but to a certain degree they would reflect actual improvements experienced in trade.With regard to the money market during October -after the fall in the Bank Rate on the 1st October, and pro-bablyalso owing to the distribution of dividends., there was a greater sense of ease in the market. During the month, however, no doubt largely owing to the continued with-drawal of gold, the market got very much firmer, and there had been great demand for money of late. The Bill rate had gone up from about 3^/8 at the beginning of the month to about 3f or rather more now.   Loans had been floated during the month amounting to 51 millions, about the largest figure we had known for a long time.Mr, Tennant thought that the remarks of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the previous eveningthat the embargo on foreign issues was to be removed, would be welcomed. It was hoped and believed this would eventually have some good effect on trade,SIR FELIX SCHUSTER desired to confirm what Mr, Tennant had said.   Things were distinctly more hopeful except in the two departments of agriculture and shipbuilding. Those were in a bad condition, and there was no improvement to report there.   From the trade centres, Lancashire and Yorkshire, the reports were very hopeful.   He thought it was more than merely a hopeful feeling, and was based on actual trade; and dlreotly such a feeling based on some actual experience spread, it encouraged the retailers to buy,  and a general improvement,resulted.   The export trade also was not in a bad condition.COLONEL 7/HLEY observed that he had been away for six weeks, but in looking through the Federation of British Industries reports from all over the country, he found that with hardly any exceptions, they gave an indication of a distinctly more hopeful view in all trades and of an expansion of business.At an Advisory Council meeting in the summer he had summarised the conclusions drawn from an examination which the Federation had made, the result of which seemed to make. clear that the export trades were at a disadvantage as against the sheltered trades in this country. However, as price levels seemed to have tended towards equation between America and this country and other countries as a whole, the situation had rather been eased, and that seemed to be a foundation for a hope that there would be some trade expansion; but as against that, one reservation should be made so far as the United States are concerned, where there is great prosperity and a high degree of employment, (See also the section &quot;Trade in the United States&quot;).MR. STANLEY MACHIN said that he was pleased to be able to confirm the views generally expressed as to the improved outlook in trade.   From the reports which he had
GENERAL TRAPS AND BANKING (CONTD).received from various parts of the country, not only in connection with the trade in which he was specially interested but general trade, there was no doubt a much more hopeful outlook than there had been a few months ago. But there was no doubt also about this great pall of labour &quot;trouble, which was disturbing everyone at the present time;    and also he could not see how we were going to regain our position or recover our export trade, until we faced the fact that our rtftsts of production were too high.   Mr. Sutcliffe Smith hsfa. said that some other countries were experiencing increased costs of production;   but, speaking from his own experience in Belgium and France, where he had works, the costs of production there were nothing like what they were here for identical articles.    Some reference had also been made to Germany. Personally he took the view that Germany was going to be a much greater competitor in the future than she had yet been since the war.   At present she was suffering severely from want of capital and having to pay fabulous prices for it, but he would imagine that the removal of the embargo on foreign loans, which he thought would be generally welcomed, would do a good deal to remove that difficulty, and enable Germany to get credits and increase her facilities for exporting; and unless we could somehow get into the minds of our people that we could not afford to pay extravagent wages, we would not be able to get our costs of production down to anything like the competitive rates now ruling In Continental markets.The point had been mentioned by Colonel Willey, and others, of manufacturers going direct to consumers (see &quot;Trade in the United States&quot;).   There was nothing new in the idea, but it should not be considered that the wholesaler is a hanger on and useless in this country.   Mr. Machin regarded the wholesaler, especially in the food trade, as absolutely essential.   He knew cases in which great wholesale firms were financing firms of retailers which could not carry on their business unless they had accommodation,  say, of two months&apos; credit.   Apart from that, the conditions in America were entirely different from what they were here. America was practically self-supporting, we were an importing country, especially for an Immense proportion of our foods.   He would ask what would happen if the retailer were expected to look to the overseas market to send him his imported foods direct.    It would be impossible to do It.   The charges for wholesalers&apos; services were on the smallest possible scale.    In the case of one of the biggest in London the net result rfas only 1% on the turnover.SIR FELIX SCHUSTER confirmed the observation which Mr. Stanley Machin had made about German competition. It was perfectly true that there was now a great lack of capital In Germany,  and it Interfered very considerably with her trade, but he did not think we ought to build on that. They were making every effort to increase their export trade, which was absolutely necessary to pay reparations, and in view of the operation of the Dawes scheme very good judges foresaw a very much cheaper money market In Germany in years to come. He thought one was forced to that conclusion because Germany taxes her own people in order to aocumulate the amount due to other9 *y 9
9   MGENPJRAL TRADE AND BANKING  (CONTD.) ,nations, but it could not be exported. The result of that was that it had got to be employed in Germany itself, and the creditor nations had only a charge on the fund, which was used to support German trade - it could not be other-wise - and to compete with Germany&apos;s creditors, and in particular with ourselves.MR. BRAND wrote :-&quot;The French situation is known to everyone through the press. The French Government is now faced with an extra-ordinarily difficult financial task because they have delayed to tackle it till absolutely the eleventh hour.   It is diffi-cult to see now how it can be dealt with except through great additional inflation, or some form of composition with the holders of the National Debt.    I do not believe myself that a true Capital Levy Is possible in France. The future of the franc Is therefore extremely uncertain.&quot;In Germany conditions are slightly improving, but credit restriction is still very severe.   As you will have noticed, there is a movement in Germany, both in the chemical and iron and steel trades, as well as elsewhere, towards huge amalgamations.    It would certainly be Interesting to have some really-well-informed authority advise as to why the conditions leading to amalgamation in Germany do not appear to be effective here, and whether the policy of amalgamation leads to the beneficial results which the Germans evidently anticipate from it.&quot;in America, while of course no lowering of interest rates is to be expected, it looks as if for the present there will not be a raising of rates.   It looks further as if for the time being the export of gold has had some strengthening effect upon the dollar exchange,&quot;Extract from Trade Reports of the Westminster Bank for Octoberr 1925.Agriculture.During the past month, the threshing of wheat proceeded steadily in some parts of the country.   Prices were not on the whole very satisfactory, and for this reason there was a tendency to withhold supplies . Oats yielded fairly well, and prices were maintained.   For barley, quotations ruled low for the poorer qualities, but best malting samples were in good demand and sold to advantage.Dairy cows were in request; trade showed a tendency to Improve and quotations hardened. Prices and supplies of store and fat cattle were generally satisfactory, whilst a good demand was experienced for calving cows and heifers, and remunerative sales resulted.As a rule, trade in sheep was fair. An all-round improve-ment was noticeable in the demand for pigs, and prices advanced accordingly. Anxiety was caused by fresh outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, in various parts of the country,
GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING  (contd. ,) .which seriously affected those farmers relying upon the disposal of live-stock.Pears were  scarce, but there was a heavy orop of apples in Kent, where the acreage under fruit is being steadily increased. It is the opinion of many of the principal growers that there is still considerable scope for development in this industry.Bpots and Shoe s.In tho Midland centres the improvement noted in the pre-ceding month was maintained, and at Northampton made slight progress In the home section, where firms engaged in producing heavier goods were fairly busy, though manufacturers of finer grades were not so well favoured.   Seasonal quietness prevailed In the export trade.Hps iery,As in the earlier part of the year, wholesale housesbought sparingly.   Leicester hosiery manufacturers experienceda little rush of orders in October..   There was not muchunemployment in the industry, and given seasonable weather a busy winter is foreseen.Trade in artificial silk hose was extremely quiet, and Nottingham makers expected it to remain so until the large stocks imported before the Budget duties came into force, were absorbed.    Prices of artificial silk hose were lower than ever before, and current quotations tended to allay the fear that the tariff would increase the cost to   the consumer.JLeather.No material change in leather trade conditions was reported last month.    Production was In excess of demand, which was mainly of a hand-to-mouth character, and the poverty of the continental markets was felt.   The Bristol re-port spoke of a more optimistic tone.Motor. &amp; Cycle Trades .Manufacturers of Motor Cars at Coventry were generally well satisfied with the results of the recent Motor Show, and were busily engaged in arranging for the execution of the orders booked there.   The bulk of the home trade having been assured through the re-imposed import duties, makers were In many instances able to quote for overseas orders at figures never before touched, and it was predicted that the results would be noticeably reflected in the export figures for the first half of next year.   Aeroplane engine construc-tion continued to progress and gave promise of becoming an increasingly valuable addition to Coventry&apos;s local industries.
SHIPPING .SIR ALAN ANDERSON observed that freights had been falling steadily since the beginning of the year, and they were now 23% of 1920,&apos; as against 28% of 1920 a year ago.   And for the first time, he thought, they had dropped definitely below the corresponding period, pre-war.   They were now 99 A% of September, 193.3.   Expenses however,  were of course very much higher than in 1913.   When one looked back to the figures of a year ago, it was found that there was a wheat scare on the Continent then, which caused a little panic chartering, and when that fell off, freights dropped.    Of course also, the effects of the Ruhr had not quite finished a year ago; whilst this year there had been some complica-tions with the Russian grain shipments, to which reference had been made at last meeting.    The grain had not come forward, and so the ports were congested with shipping,heavy demurrage claims were running up and a certain number of charters have been cancelled. The Black Sea was out Of the market now.    On the other hand, the anthracite strike in America had caused some chartering in that direction.   This anthracite strike might possibly be one of the first Obvious results of shutting down immigration; it was a question how long the Americans would be able to hold their labour costs without a fresh flow of poor immigrants.Laid up tonnage amounted to 770,000 tons on July 1st, as against 470,000 tons a year ago.    Tonnage in construction in the United Kingdom was now just over 1,000,000 tons gross, and abroad (including the United States) it was 1,200,000, making 2,200,000 in all,     A year ago in the United Kingdom it was 1,400,000 and abroad 1,100,000, making 2-1 millions. On the other hand, the tonnage commenced, which was rather more important perhaps, had gone up in the United Kingdom from 252,000 to 260,000 tons gross in the quarter ended September last year and this, respectively, whereas abroad it had fallen from 278,000 tons to 244,000 tons, so that we were at present commencing more than half the world&apos;s -new tonnage.    Of course, if that were purely the action of the shipowners it would be a good sign, but shipowners were rather suspicious about the interventions which had taken place to encourage ship building.    The figures of freights did not conclusively show the position of shipping, because those figures related to the tramp ship owner only, and the new ships which were being begun were very largely special ships and a more expensive type of ship, which was good in its way, but until we got the tramp ship owners coming in in the mass with orders, we could not get the big demand that was needed.The fact that the building now was of a different character from the building before the war was overlooked sometimes In the comparison of costs.    There had been an article In the &quot;Economist&quot; which said that building costs here were very much higher than they had been before the war and they compared them ton for ton, whereas they were not properly comparable.   An opinion had also been expressed in the Press, that British shipping was largely out of date. This was not the case, however.    The average age of British vessels is less than it was.
SHIPPING (CONTD,) .Another thing which was rather agitating ship owners was the question of the frontiers of activity of the International Labour Office, who appeared to have it in mind that because labouring men travelled at sea, therefore all the regulations concerning travel at sea should come within the province of the International Labour Office, Shipowners  demurred, to that; they thought that if a labouring person travelled at sea, he did not travel as a labourer, but as a passenger; the labourer at sea //as the seaman. Sir Allan added that the President had informed a deputation of shipowners that the representatives of H.M. Government at the Conference on Emigration called by the International Labour Office, would be instructed to confine themselves strictly to matters within the competence of the International Labour Office.THE PRESIDENT of the Board of Trade observed that if he understood aright, it was not in the least desired by the shipowners to withdraw from the competence of the League of Nations any matter of international interest, but that the League should deal with it through its appropriate organisation.    Thus labour matters should be dealt with by the Labour Office, but matters which involved many other considerations should be dealt with by the full machinery of the League of Nations,SIR ALAN ANDERSON assented.RAILWAY TRAFFIC .MR. BROOKE observed that there was no marked change In the railway figures, nor any sign of any improvement at present.    Both passenger  and goods traffic was consistently falling off, although not quite so heavily now as in August. During July everybody bought coal in anticipation of a strike, and therefore in August there was a falling off of 3  million tons, which was an enormous decrease.    The total receipts up to date this year are  3,300,000 less than for the corresponding period last year, which, however, showed about the same reduction from the corresponding figures the year before.    In August, apart from the big drop in coal, general merchandise fell off by about 250,000 tons,that is&apos; 5;&quot;., as compared with August a year ago.    The only increase in the most recent figures was in passengers on. the Southern Railway,  a chiefIj urban population.
9 r) Qa i 6CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY.SIR THOMAS ALLEN said that there was an increase in every essential commodity of food, on the year, both as regards wholesale and retail prices, with the exception of the single article of sugar.    Sales were down on the quarter In sugar, flour and   - tobacco, and on the year in sugar, flour, tea, tobacco and grain generally.    Prices had gone upward and quantity downward, which meant, of course, downward consumption.   General drapery was also down on the quarter and on the year.   In respect of production they found a decrease in milling, in their tailoring factories, In their boots and in general woollen wear.    One commodity which appeared to be up, In quantity sold, was margarine, probably on account of the high price of butter. The position with regard to sugar was very interesting when one compared 1913 and 1925.   Taking the duty out of consideration the cost of sugar now was only about 6d. per cwt. the actual cost of the material, over what It was in 1913, and this result was attributed to two main causes, first of all the competition in American granulated, and secondly, the new position created by the British home-grown refined beet.    It was also interesting to know that Australia had this year secured a very substantial position with dried fruits on the British market. In that connection Sir Thomas thought that the suggestion of an All-British Christmas shopping week, which was an admirable one, had been made rather late in the year, so far as traders were concerned, because fancy goods, specially those that came from Prance, Germany and Japan, were bought very early in the year, i.e., about March.PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE appreciated that, but pointed, out that if an appeal had been made about that date, it would have been dead by the time that the general public s Christmas buying season arrived.SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY.MR. GALLACHER said that since last month trade had slowly improved in Scotland, particularly in groceries, and the furnishing lines.    In drapery and boots there was still something of a lag, owing to the recent good weather, which had resulted in increased sales of overcoatings footwear and so on, being delayed.At the request of the Food Council Mr. Gallacher had had a statement prepared showing the cost of a small family budget throughout this year from January onwards.   This is annexed at the end of this paragraph,  as it may be of interest to the Advisory Council also.The statement showed that there had been a downward tendency.    The Increase in July was explained by the fact that the price of new potatoes was more than double than that of the old.
HBOBKoamiBms379SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY (CONTD).Referring to what Colonel Willey said about wholesalers and retailers in America (see section headed &quot;Trade in the United States&quot;) as to the wholesaler having been eliminated and the manufacturer seeking immediate contact with the retailer, Mr. Gallaoher 3aid that in this oountry there had been an attempt to do the same thing for. some time, but it had failed.   His own Society had endeavoured to send their goods from the factories to the retail societies but they found it more economical to send the goods in large quantities to the wholesalers and from there to the retailer, and whatever might be the situation in America the direct system did not quite suit the trade here, because there were long credits and risks of bad debts. Manufacturers could not stand these because their profits were small, but retailers could because their profits were tremendous.   There was a strong feeling about the huge profits taken by the retailers on their goods.   Perhaps some day the drapery trade might be dealt with in a similar way to the food trade.    It was very bad indeed.COMPARATIVE COST OF FAMILY BUDGET FOR NINE MONTHS JANUARY/SEPTEMBER, 1925.1925.Jan.Feb.Moh.Apl.May,June,July.Aug.Sept,Jfh........1-lb..fbp Cheese . 1-lb.. ft-out smoked1-lb..

UNEMPLOYMENT.MR. T.W. PHILLIPS aaid that the figures of the registered unemployed during October had been distinctly encouraging.    There was a drop during the month of 104,700, In fact, the figure at the end of the month was the lowest registered since the end of May, apart from one rather abnormal figure in the last week of July.   Some part of the reduction, no doubt, arose from disallowances of benefit under the new rules now in force, but for the most part it represented a real fall in numbers,During September there were substantial improvements in iron ore mining, pottery, tin plate, cotton and wool; the only considerable Industry which became substantially worse was glass bottle making.Comparing the end of September with a year previously, ccal mining of course shewed a great increase in unemployment; other trades with large increases were pig iron manufacture, pottery, tinplate, shipbuilding and marine engineering, wool and boots.    The main trades which were substantially better in September than a ye&amp;r previously were general and motor engineering, and cotton.AUSTRALIAN  TRADE,MR, SANDERSON observed that this was a time of year in Australia when the absence of rain always caused a good deal of anxiety, and recently the rains had been short, with the result that the wheat and dairy farmers were particularly affected, and later, if the shortage continued, pastoral farming would suffer.   During the last month wool prices had increased and sales in Australia were progressing with a very keen demand.   The shipping trouble, of course, was affecting the various markets and trades; it had been estimated that up to the end of November about 682,000 carcases of lamb would be shipped, but shipping accommodation could only be arranged for 236,000,INDIAN TRADE.MR. LINDSAY observed that last month he reported what seemed to be indications of a gradual return to normal conditions in Indian trade - that was, dorm to August; and the figures received for September showed that that tendency had gone a little further than one expected at the time, as the balance of trade which had been favourable to India for many months past was adverse during September.   That was largely due to seasonal considerations such as the natural falling off of exports during the rainy months of August and September.
INDIAN TRADE (CONTD.) .The  crop outlook which affected the exports during the next busy season, was satisfactory.    Forecasts received so far of five principal crops showed an increase in acreage under sowings from 103 to 106 million sores.    Particularly the cotton crop gave signs of exceeding even last year&apos;s record figure.    The Indian Central Cotton Committee were doing their utmost to popularise Indian cottons in this country.   Some of the Oldham spinners were going to spin test bales of Indian cotton, and it was hoped that the possibilities of the cotton would become better known, particularly those types which competed with the American, of which India   produced several. It was rather unfortunate that while this special effort was being made owing to the slump of American being greater than the fall in Indian cotton prices, the margin between the two had contracted severely.   From one point of view that was good, but from another they felt that they were getting higher prices than they could really stand, In a way. The margin on the 1st August between American and Tinnlvelly, one of the best Indian cottons,  was 139 points, whilst the latest quotation showed a reduction to 63 points.   The margin was halved in three months,The figures given at the last meeting with regard to the relative positions of this country, the Continent, Japan and America in the Indian import trade, showed a falling off in the British share which was almost entirely taken up by Japan.   A similar comparison had now been made for the export figures, and it was found that for the same period, five months from April to August 1925, the British share of India&apos;s exports had fallen from 24$ to &apos;2Q$, while the Japanese share had risen from 13$ to 17$.   Such ground as this country was losing In India was not, on the whole, being lost to the Continent, but to Japan; and it was being lost very largely In cotton textiles.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE,MR. HOSE wrote&quot;Official statistics of Argentine foreign trade in the first six months of the current year show that the total value of exports was 12,7$ lower than in the corresponding period of 1924, and the favourable balance of trade was reduced to only $59,300,000 (gold), against $157,600,000 In the first half of 1924.   Nevertheless, the exchange value of Argentine currency has recently exhibited pro-nounced firmness, the sterling rate having touched 46%d. on 9th October, thereby reaching the highest point since January, 1922.    This improvement appears to reflect the great recovery that has taken place in the general financial and economic position of the Republic during the past two years,   ss well as the very favourable prospects for the forthcoming harvest.   The higher exchange naturally
Q o nSOUTH AMERICAN TRADE  (CONTD.).tends to encourage Import &quot;business, and arrivals of goods In&quot; the &quot;country during the first half of the current year totalled In value more than 6% over those for the first six months of 1924,    In all the circumstances, there is reason to believe that this expansion In import trade will continue.&quot;In Chile, the outlook continues to be obscured by political and labour dissensions.   At the recent Presidential elections, Sr. Emiliano Figuerda was returned by a large majority, but the supporters of the defeated Labour candidate succeeded in bringing about a general strike for a period of two days.   The Authorities were obliged to impose martial law as a temporary measure, and business has naturally been rendered inactive for the time being.   Minor disturbances have occurred, and some suspicion of the attitude of the Army is felt by the supporters of the new President,   The plebiscite recently held has resulted in favour of the adoption of the new national Constitution,   A general election of both Houses of Congress will bo held in November, and foreign commercial interests; no less than native, are anxiously awaiting to see what steps will then be taken with regard to the various laws, mainly of a debatable nature, which were hurriedly passed just before the dissolution of the last Congress in September, 1924, and which are at present being enforced,&quot;In addition to the Law creating the Banco Central de Chile and the establishment of the new gold par value of the peso at 6d,, instead of 18d,, to which I referred at the last meeting of the Council, further legislation has been promulgated in regard to the conduct of banking   business. The relative Law has just come to hand, and, from a cursory inspection, would appear to institute safeguards on the conduct of banking business in general, being somewhat on the lines of the U.S.A. Federal Reserve banking system. So far as British banks are concerned, their business has alvfays been conducted on conservative lines.&quot;It had been anticipated that, by reason of various steps adopted, equilibrium would have been established this year in the Chilean national finances,    *&apos;/e were therefore rather surprlsod to be informed recently by cable that there was an outstanding deficit In the national finances of about 100,000,000 pesos.   The Minister of Finance hopes, however, to liquidate this next year by national economies, by part proceeds of forthcoming sales of nitrate grounds, and increased taxation, as well as by the possible consolidation on favourable terms of the outstanding external debts.&quot;Notwithstanding the political and labour unrest, the foreign trade of Chile continues to expand, and would doubtless improve still further if these retarding influences ware removed.&quot;With regard to Mexico, there is now prevalent a certain degree of optimism, encouraged by the economy campaign of the present Government, and there appear to be some grounds for believing that increased activity in business may be seen. However.the agrarian and labour disturbances continue, although in a less violent form, and the resulting lack of confidence will doubtless counteract for some time any benefit which might accrue from the otherwise favourable outlook.
q O O ei U wSOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD .) .&quot;Peru seems to have made distinct recovery from the slump in business caused by the severe floods in March last, when crops were destroyed and railway transport dislocated.   Ship-ments of sugar, cotton, and copper are again expanding, and a small favourable balance of trade was re-established in July last, whilst exchange has improved distinctly during the past fortnight.&quot;TRADE IN THE UNITED STATES.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR said that In America there was at last, after a long period of practically three years, a rise in the price of high-speed steels and alloy steel, and Sheffield makers were just getting a little business there. We would probably never be able to do a big trade, because the service which the Americans could give was so good that we should have to put in very large stocks and pay enormous duties, and there did not seem to be any prospect of recovering the trade in bulk.Although general reports on American conditions were very favourable, yet the big steel works wore in rather a bad way, really. They had a lot of special plant which only runs for two or three months out of the year, and stands the other eight or nine, because they could not keep it going, and the finance of some of the big steel works outside the big group was not very happy.COLONEL WILIEY observed, in regard to the United States, that the Stock Market reflected the state of trade, and the rises in prices of stocks were tremendous.   If one examined the market valuation of stocks since President Coolidge was elected, it was found that 37 representative stocks have risen 1,500 million Dollars.   There were many factors which contributed to that edvance of the stock market figures, but among the most noticeable factors was the increase in efficiency, both personal and mechanical, on every side, which had resulted in a reduced number of operatives being employed in the carrying on of every kind of work, be it manual or clerical, and the introduction of further labour saving machinery.   The fashion for keeping low stocks of merchandise, and the immense acceleration of service on the railways, had made this possible, and in this way they hoped to avoid the risks of wide fluctuations on the market.   That had released an enormous amount of money.   To take the building figures, - the plant increases had ceased, and the explanation of that was that they were getting so much more efficiency out of the existing plant that they could keep pace with the existing demand without further expenditure on plant; and instead of putting earnings Into plant they had the means available for large dividends,
ti 0 4CONFID^TLaL . TRADg IN THE UNITED STATES (CONTD).There seemed to he another factor, which was that the Government was encouraging, (and everybody was collabora-ting in It and succeeding&quot;up to now) the keeping of prices from rising, so that any advance on raw materials that might occur should be offset by increased efficiency. The aim throughout industry was to   keep prices down and rely upon maintaining profits by a smaller margin on a bigger turnover.Another point was that the virtual elimination of the wholesaler as a carrier of stocks was bringing the consumer into direct touch with the producer. It was Increasing the rapidity of the turnover, and of course lessening the amount of merchandise in the country. It meant a much smaller investment of capital, which was going to keep costs down.   Meanwhile, the maintenance of their standard of living did not seem to be forcing up the cost of production.There was one other point to be mentioned - the very unfavourable impression whioh had been caused in the United States a3 the result of the French negotiations, And it was very marked how sympathy was running away from France both in that matter and with regard to militarism. British prestige, on the other hand, had increased.In reply to an enquiry as to what action the United States Government were taking, to keep prices down, Colonel Willey referred to the building trade position. Two years ago the Immense expansion of building brought abou.t a position in which the demand for structural material was exceeding the supply, and accordingly the Government, after conferring with the representatives of the building trade, proceeded to take steps with regard to advances for building purposes,  and requested the Governors of all States, and through them the Mayors of all leading Municipalities, to collaborate with them in suspending new building operations.    It also shut down all building operations that it could control, and that cessation of building,together with the powers at the disposal of the Government, and the sentiment which these created right through the country, produoed the desired result. The next best example was what the Government did with regard to sugar.    They recommended everybody to stop buying sugar and that brought the price down.MR. SUTCLIFFS SMITH said that as regards the American position, one of his firm&apos;s largest works was in America, and he thought a good deal of the Increased efficiency that Col, tfllley was referring to was psychological. They paid their workmen   there on piecework.    They gave them their regular wage which was earned on piecework in a white envelope.    The bonus which was given for any extra production they gave in a blue envelope.    The men were always looking forward to getting as much in that blue envelope as possible.    Almost every one of their men there had a motor car and came to work in it , and they found this system of payment a very good Idea which worked quite well.
*js O *trade IN CHINA.MR. LANDALE said that generally speaking, business in Shanghai and the north of China was Improving, but in the South the improvement was very slow.As to imports into Shanghai; although the piecegoods auctions had not been re-started, yet a   good deal of business was being done privately, but there was not much business in hardware and machinery.    In exports there was very little business, as prices were above Indian quotations for such things as oil seeds, cotton, etc.   There had been a large business in raw silk both from China and Japan,In the South, the Government in Canton still continued to boycott Hongkong and to encourage shipping strikes. In spite of this, however, business was gradually improving and ports south of Canton were being used for distribution.The Consortium of International Bankers, at a meeting recently held in New York, expressed the opinion that railway revenues should be kept intact for railway purposes, including the service of railway loans.   This principle could only be carried out if and when the Central Government regained control over the railways and was in a position to protect them from interference and damage by the independent military leaders.   At present the Central Government was powerless, consequently all the railways from north to south were under the domination of the military,   The loan service to the extent of  210,000 of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway Supplementary Loan, due in London on 18th October, and for payment to Bondholders on 2nd November, was in default; and it was reported that an attempt had been made by the Commander of the Forces opposing Chang Tso Lin to seize the rolling stock of the Shanghai-Nanking Railway and Shanghai-Hangchow-Ningpo Railway, with a view to transferring it over the Yangtsze river.   The earnings of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway must have been more than sufficient to meet the loan service above referred to if they had not been diverted for other purposes.

&amp; n.%tii Kf tffStatement regarding the export tirade position made at the meeting.of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Overseas Trade, held cn the 21st October,1925,IRON AND STEEL.     -Sir Arthur Balfour (special steels,  tools, etc.) who was unable to be present sent the following statement to the Committee: -&quot;I am glad to be able to say that there has been a decided forward movement in the export trade for Sheffield steels and Sheffield tools, during the past few weeks.August and September proved very bad months Indeed, but there is a real prospect of an increase in exports, during November and December,  as a result of the business which is now being booked.German competition has fallen off in several direc-tions,  as they have been compelled to raise their prices, and one also knows of several cases, where they have been forced to curtail their organisation,  owing to financial stringency.      The prices of engineers tools, i,e., drills, milling cutters,  etc-,  are still at-an unremunerative rate, but if trade were to improve somewhat,  this would gradually adjust itself.-On the whole,  there has been an improvement in produc-. tion per man, which Is a. very hopeful sign&quot;.MR. BAKER (special steels,  steel works plant, Sheffield lighter trades, etc.,) stated that in the special steel trade of Sheffield there was a feeling cf confidence lately, especi-ally since the result of the Locarno Conference was known and he thought that old avenues of trade might be opened up again.A very important contributory factor was the recent drop in the price of coal.    While on the question of the price of coal, especially in connection with forward contracts, he stated that the present uncertainty in the coal Industry was likely to have a prejudicial effect on business.As regards the cutlery trades, he stated that, an applica-tion was about to be made to the Safeguarding of Industries Committee.   He instanced as part of the difficulties of the cutlery trade that the German grinders and finishers etc., were working for littlo more than half the rates paid to British employees and also they were putting in longer hours.    In Sheffield men were working for l/Sd.  an hour for a 47 hour week and in Germany from 8-gd. to lOdo an hour on a 56 hour basis.SIR WILLIAM LARKE  (pig Iron,  steel,  castings, etc.,) sent a letter to the Committee, In which he drew attention to the fact that Imports of iron and steel for September were 199,000 tons compared with 207,000 tens a year ago,  while exports for September were 275,000 tons against 263,000 tons a year ago. He stated, however, that the situation really showed no improve-ment except that it had become better defined as the result of the financial difficulties of Germany.MR. BOND. /
O a nSHIPBUILDING.MR. BARR stated that in the shipbuilding industry the disparTCy in rates of wages as compared with Germany closely approximated to the conditions obtaining in the steel industry. He added, that in Sunderland, whereas the bulk of the work came in the past from Scandinavia to this country, this work was now going to Germany and Holland.     Moreover, orders were being lost at home as well as abroad.     He stated that as was well known, the question of the difficulties in the shipbuilding industry had recently been gone into by a committee,  consisting of employers and trade unions.COTTON.MR. LEE stated that there were signs of improvement in., the cotton trade.    The price of cotton was down to a reasonable figure and he considered that they were on the eve of better trade.I - :r&apos;&apos;.!He reported,  that certain orders were being lost to the United States of America through the fact that the mills in the south were working 60 hours per week and double shifts.   He thought that it would undoubtedly be of great benefit to Lancashire if a duty was placed on the importation into India from Japan of coarse counts, of yarn.MR. HOLROYD agreed generally with the views expressed by. Mr. Lee.   He thought the prospects were good if cotton remained, j at a reasonable price.    As regards India he pointed out that before the war 30 million lbs of yarn were shipped to India from this country, while Japan sent 20 million.    Now the figures were reversed;    while from April to July last Japan sent 16 million-lbs, England only sent 4 million.   He thought the time had come for an arrangement with the Indian spinners.     He expressed the opinion that Lancashire would raise no objection to the abolition of the 3g- per cent, excise duty in India, provided they received some quid pro quo in the form of a preference.    He stated that the matter was shortly to be considered by the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners and also by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce.The Chairman requested that in the event of a resolution being passed by the Chamber,  a copy should be sent to the Department, when it would receive the most careful consideration.As regards business with Russia there were possibilities of large orders which could not be financed,  and. he thought that the Export Credits scheme should be applied to Russia. Mr. Samuel stated that while neither he nor the Government wished to hinder in any way business which was urgently required in this country, the view of the Government was that the sanctity of a contract should be upheld and that defaulters should not be encouraged by the grant of fresh credits after they had repudiated their obligations.    Mr. llackinder stated that while agreeing generally as to the necessity for honouring obligations he thought that it had been possible to come to an agreement with the Russian delegation and that he understood that Mr. Rakowsky was prepared unofficially to admit liability if an arrangement could be come to.AGRICULTURAL/MR. BOND stated that there was a pronounced improvement in the iron and steel trades during the last three months. As regards the tinplate trade in South Wales they were working to a 95 per cent, capacity against a 65% capacity three months ago.    The fall in the price of coal of 4/- or 5/- a ton had made it difficult for the United States to compete.     He also emphasized the uncertainty due to the holding over of a settle-men t of the coal trade difficulty.
AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY.MR. ROWLAND stated that there were signs of improvement In the agricultural engineering industry.    He wished, however, to emphasize once again the fact that the uncertainty in the coal trade -and in the general Industrial situation here was having the effect of restricting buying,POTTERY.MR.  JOHNSTON stated that the position in the pottery-trade had not &quot;improved.    He raised the question of the return to the gold standard which he stated he had mentioned at the last meeting.    The effect of this had been that they had had to drop their prices&quot;for export 10 per cent, and to France 20 per cent.    The Chairman stated that he did not wish to enter into a polemical discussion on a controversial matter, but in his opinion the ultimate benefits of the return to the gold standard would more than outweigh any temporary dis-advantages.GENERAL .MR.  GRAY BUCHANAN (iron and steel, metals,  India merchant trade,  etc., j stated that he had recently made a tour of certain Dominion markets and he had found a strong desire to stock British goods.    He regretted, however,  that in-certain cases  there was a marked deterioration in the quality of certain steel products.    He also mentioned certain technical points in the rolling of steel plate which he proposed, to take up with Sir William Larke .He wished to point out, however,  that orders had been placed in this country from the United States for 100^000 tons of pig iron In which many firms had shared.    This had given considerable encouragement to the trade generally,  and he would like to add that the orders were obtained in competition with Germany,  France and Belgium.As regards India, he stated that Messrs.  Tata &amp; Company, and the Bengal Iron and Steel Company,  were,  through the grant of the Indian subsidy,  able to dump iron into Scot-land.    He-wished to draw attention to this bounty question,  on the ground that though the bounty was given to purely Indian firms,  it had not been given to two British companies,  though they had set up foundries in India and had employed Indian labour.INDIAN TRADE.MR. LINDSAY stated that as regards India imports were steady,  while there was a seasonable falling off in exports, In fact, Indian trade was reverting to the normal,   a curious sign of this being that the September trade balance was adverse. He regretted to. say, however,  that there had been a general falling off in the British proportion of the import trade in staple lines,  though as regards the iron and steel trades the British proportion had increased from 68 per cent, before the war to 72 per cent,  of the whole.    As regards cotton piece goods there had been a reduction of the British share from 94 per cent, before the war to 82 per cent,  at the present time. In cotton yarns there was also a falling off from 88 per cent, to 37 per cent.    In all the circumstances he considered it a subject for remark that the British proportion was as high as it was.    This he attributed to no small extent to the fact that Indian firms were accustomed to English goods and British methods of doing business.miAs/
As regards a suggestion made by Mr, Holroyd, he under-stood that Mr, Wadia, the&apos; President of the Bombay Miliowners Association was over in this country to discuss the question of the imposition of a differential duty in India against coun-tries which did not enforce the stanclard of hours,  etc., laid down in the Washington Convention,    If this duty were imposed it might have an important bearing on the course of trade. Japan would either have to pay this duty or to revise their methods of work and abolish night shifts for women.As regards the question raised by Mr.  Gray Buchanan he did not see that a bounty on steel production could be of much assistance in enabling Tatas to dump pig iron in Scotland,, In any case Tatas were the only firm who received the bounty.There was another point which he wished to raise which, though it did not greatly concern Indian trade, had an important bearing on the entrepot trade of this country.    He referred to the regulations which have been made as to the disinfection of East Indian goat-hair at Liverpool.      The result of these stringent rules was that goat-hair was not being shipped to Liverpool, but was going to its destination direct.    He under-stood that as a result the disinfection station was not fully employed and that the proposal had now been made to apply the same rules to the East Indian wool trade.    This he thought would have a further adverse effect on the entrepot trade here.LABOUR.MR. &apos;MACKIHDER stated that he had been a member of the GommitTee which had drafted the regulations which were drawn up in the interests of the workers and to safeguard them from danger of anthrax and any attempt to modify the regulations would receive strong opposition.    Sir William Clark stated that he had already received a communication from a forme;? Minister of the Department who was keenly interested In this trade and the matter was receiving the most careful consideration from every point of view.    He stated, however,  that any further information Mr. Lindsay might have would be welcome.    Mr, Mackinder also wished to point out that the Australian tariff was inimical to British export trade interests.    He desired to draw attention to the fact that although it was still possible to talk about a British preference the modified duty on imports was in fact so high that,  in practice,  the tariff would prohibit imports of any kind.    He thought that this matter should not be lost sight of.
