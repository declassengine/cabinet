CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.-jfO-^- &apos; &apos;&quot;     &apos;-YQv\ &apos; . . .:-\-   - * ^   n^b.,.      4 I o - y       -    CABINET.&amp; -p -   ,,---Y, // -&apos; iNote by Mr. Chamberlain.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a record of a conversation between the German Ambassador and Mr. Wellesley which I received this evening at 8-30.I sent my reply to the Ambassador&apos;s note and declaration by telephone about or before 5 p.m.The German Government and the German Ambassador continue to talk as if no one&apos;s feelings were of, any account except their own, as if no other country or Government had a public opinion to consider, and as if no one else had toes to be trodden on. This conversation would not have caused me to alter the terms of my reply. It would be a hopeless task to go to Locarno if the German Government received the impression that they can say what they please, no matter how irrelevant or how provocative, without fear of any reply. I thought it right to mark, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, not only surprise but some indignation.I received the terms proposed by M. Briand for the French reply by telegraph and telephone at the very moment of sitting down to write the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I purposely made the British reply a little staffer than the French answer, for (i) Herr Sthamer had handed me a written declaration and had not offered to transform it into a verbal explanation, and (ii) I thought it right to mark for public opinion here and in Germany that His Majesty&apos;s Government shared to the full the surprise and indignation felt by M. Briand at the character of the communication, and to indicate that throughout the Pact negotiations from the month of April onwards such difficulties as there have been have all come from the German side. - I trust that my colleague will approve. As the German Government refused to delay publication, there was no time to ask for a Cabinet.,September 29, 1925. ;C 12387/459/18]A. C.Memorandum by Mr. Wellesley.THE German Ambassador called again this afternoon, and said that he had an urgent message to deliver. He told me that he had just received information from Berlin to the effect that M. Briand had made a proposal that the German Declaration should be published in the German press in what he described as some indirect form, making it clear that no written communication had been made. The French Government would then issue a communique giving their comments on what had appeared in the German press. M. Briand hoped that this would be the easiest way out of the present difficulty. Unfortunately, however, the German Ambassador said this proposal was one which the German Government could not possibly accept. He went on to explain that the Federal Ministers and the Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Reichstag had been informed of the steps which the German Govern-ment had decided to take in Paris, Brussels and London. If they were now to fall in with the French proposals it would at once create a storm, as it would be evident that their action had not conformed to what had been agreed upon. Herr Sthamer then said that when the Dawes Conference was being held last year it had been the original German intention to mention this question of war guilt, but in order not to jeopardise the success of the conference it had been dropped. Chancellor Marx, however, found it necessary subsequently to declare in the most solemn way that the acceptance of the Dawes plan did not in any way mean the acceptance by Germany of article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles. The German Government, therefore, felt it absolutely necessary on this occasion to put in the present Declaration. [13613]
Otherwise they could hot carry with them public opinion in Germany, nor would they have a free hand, which they considered absolutely necessary for the forthcoming negotiations.The Ambassador, however, went on to say that while at first the German Government had thought that a written reply to the Declarations would necessarily entail the breaking-off of the Pact negotiations, they were now disposed to think that if a written reply were couched in considerate terms they would still be able to continue with them. Everything, however, would depend on the terms of such a reply. The Ambassador once more assured me of the sincere desire of the German Government to bring the Pact negotiations to a successful issue, and he begged me most insistently to believe that the present difficulties were very real to the German Government, difficulties which they would far prefer to have avoided if this had been possible.I told the Ambassador that I would at-once communicate his message to the Secretary- of State. .V. w.September 29, 1925.
xzie secretary 01 SttaDe .tor F&apos;o/?-io-a  a F&apos; [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governments] -GERMANY. [September 29, 1925. confidential. Section 2.[C 12345/459/18] No. 1.Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Herr Sthamer.Your Excellency, Foreign Office, September 29, 1925.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have received with pleasure the acceptance by the Government of the Reich of the proposal for a conference on the 5th October at Locarno. His Majesty&apos;s Government note with satisfaction that the acceptance is given without reserve.In reply to the declaration which your Excellency made to me at the same time, I have the honour to take note of the assurance of your Excellency that the questions therein raised do not constitute conditions preliminary to a meeting of Foreign Ministers.These questions have, in fact, no relation to the negotiations for a Security Pact, and have formed no part of the preliminary exchange of views.As regards that part of the declaration which deals with Germany&apos;s entry into the League of Nations, His Majesty&apos;s Government note with satisfaction that the German Government raise no objection to this essential condition of any mutual pact. The question of Germany&apos;s responsibility for the war is not raised by the proposed pact, and His. Majesty&apos;s Government are at a loss to know why the German Government have thought proper to raise it at this moment. His Majesty&apos;s Government are obliged to observe that the negotiation of a Security Pact cannot modify the Treaty of Versailles or alter their judgment of the past.As regards the evacuation of the Cologne zone, I have the honour to repeat that the date of that evacuation depends solely on the fulfilment of Germany&apos;s disarmament obligations, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government will welcome the performance of those obligations as permitting the Allies at once to evacuate the northern zone.I have, &amp;c.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.[1062 ff-2]
