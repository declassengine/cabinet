P.C-L.Board of Trade,27th October, 192 5.
REPORT OP TITTER^ DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE onTEE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE IMPERIAL ECONOMIC COMMITTEE AND THE HACHZFERY NECESSARY TO GIVE EFFECT TO THEM.1. The-Imperial Economic Committee was appointed to consider means of increasing the consumption of Imperial products in the United Kingdom, and in this connection was also invited as supplementary to its main Terms of Reference to suggest schemes upon which a sum of  1,000,000 a year might he expended.2. The chief recommendations contained In the First and Second Reports of the Imperial Economic Committee are as follows:-(I) That legislation should he introduced requiring an indication of Empire and foreign origin to be shown on foodstuffs (meat and fruit in the first instance) offered for sale in the United Kingdom.(II) That a publicity and advertising campaign on behalf of empire foodstuffs generally and certain lines of commodities specifically should be initiated.(III) That a scheme of co-ordinated research irito the production and preservation of foodstuffs should be undertaken.(IV) That assistance should be given for the carriage ofpedigree stock from the United Kingdom to the overseas parts of the Empire. (V) That special steps should be taken for the development cf the trade in fruit produced in the tropical portions of the Empire. (VI) That in the expenditure of the  1,000,000 a year set aside by the Home Government, about 65^ should be allocated for the promotion of trade in Empire products, about l&amp;fi for research, and that the remaining 20/* should be reserved for other schemes of which two were referred to specifically, viz.
- tire carriage of pedigree stock and the promotion of -   fruit growing in the tropical portions of the Empire. (VII) That an &quot;Executive Commission&quot; should be formed on the model of the existing Development and Forestry Commissions for the purpose of supervising the expenditure of the annual grant and for carrying out the other recommendations set out above. 3. With regard to recommendation (I)  the Cabinet have already authorised the President of the Board of Trade,  the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to prepare the draft of a Merchandise Marks Bill which should include Dominion and Colonial produce, British, agricultural produce and British industrial products..    The Departments concerned are already in consultation on the subject.4. With regard to the next three recommendations (II), (III), and (IV) it is suggested that they should be adopted in prinoiple.5. The scheme with reference to recommendation (V) regarding the tropical fruit trade, will be further.developed in the Third Report of the Committee whioh is expected about the end of the year.    Consideration of this may,  therefore, be postponed for the present. Further schemes may eventually be proposed by the Imperial Bconomio Committee for marketing other foodstuffs.6. With regard to recommendation (VI) it is perhaps not necessary at this stage to offer any comments on the proportions suggested by the Imperial Economic Committee in the allocation of the  1,000,000 a year.    It will, however, no doubt be found advisable to review the allocation proposed by the Imperial Economic Committee at any rate after the first year.
7. i&apos;ith regard to recommendation (VII) the Interdepartment-al Committee feel that as a preliminary to discussion in detail of the machinery which will be required for carrying out what is, in effect, the chief operative recommendation of the Imperial Economic Committee a Cabinet decision is required on certain questions of principle.   These are -(A) Should the grant of  1,000,000 per annum be provided as is assumed by the Imperial Economic Committee (see paragraph 42 of First Report) as a Grant-In-aid, any unspent balance accumulating year by year, or should it be provided as an ordinary Vote or Votes, the unspent balance of which returns to the Treasury at the end of each financial year?(B) Is it desirable that the expenditure of the 1,000 , 000 per annum should cover home products as well as overseas Empire products?(C) Is the grant of  1,000,000 per annum to extend.,  sofar as overseas products are concerned, not merely to expenditure in connection with foodstuffs &quot;but also to expenditure in connection with other commodities? 8. With regard to 7 (B), the Cabinet has already, in regard to publicity, &quot;approved In principle the proposal already &quot;discussed by the President of the Board of Trade with the &quot;Chairman of the Imperial Economic Committee whereby publicity &quot;to British trade and industry and British agriculture would &quot;fall within the scope of that portion (65%) of the  1,000,000 &quot;to be  devoted by the British Government to the development of &quot;Empire trade&quot; .   Similarly in the case of research it has to toe remembered that the problems which will require investiga-tion are usually similar in character to, If not identical with, those which are already being investigated, by, or under the supervision of, existing Departments in regard to home products, and that it would be practically impossible to
The wording of the telegram Is much more specific than the speech delivered by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 17th December, 192 4.  On that occasion the words used were as follows&quot;ihe money that we estimate it may be possible to allocate -is a round  1,000,000 .a year, and we think that with an Economic Committee of the kind we. have in vie?/ - and with the terms of reference such as I have given to the House it may be possible to open up entirely new and untried ways of developing trade with the Empire, trade which will bring in Empire stuff in lieu of Foreign stuff - &quot;.    while, therefore, the Prime Minister&apos;s speech is capable   of such an interpretation as to permit of part of the  1,000,000 being expended on commodities other than foodstuffs, the telegram to the Dominion Prime Mnisters is specifically limited to foodstuffs and any change in this respect would naturally involve prior consultation with the Dominion Prime Ministers.\separate investigations on Empire products from those on home products.9.   With regard to 7(C) reference should he made to the cable of the 13th December, 192 4, to the Dominion Prime Ministers when Mr. Baldwin stated -&quot;Vie propose to devote the full money equivalent of the advantage which would, have been conferred on Empire Imports by the proposed additional duties to alternative schemes for improving the marketing of Empire imports of foodstuffs......You will realise that suras thus made available for Empire imports will be substantial, not less than  1,000,000 a year&quot;* 10. Consequently, if the answer to either or both of questions 7(B) and 7(C) is in the affirmative no public announcement could presumably be made until such decision had been communicated to the Overseas Dominions and an opportunity given to them of making their comments.11,   Whatever the decision may be in regard to 7(A), it would appear that some additional machinery will be necessary for carry-ing out the recommendation of the Imperial Economic Committee. This may take the form either of an Executive Commission, with a small executive staff itself carrying out the Committee&apos;s recomrcenda-tions, or of a consultative bod.y or bodies advising the Departments and Institutions concerned as to the allocation and expenditure of the money, the work involved being carried out by those departments and institutions themsoIvec.
12. The following are outlines of plans which have been suggested.   Plan I embodies the alternative of an Executive Commission which should itself undertake various exeoutive duties.   Plans II, III and IV are various methods of working out the alternative where the work is entrusted to existing departments, the new machinery being of an advisory or co-ordinating character.   A Cabinet decision is   required as to which of these four plans should be adopted in order that further details may be worked out.    It is prosumed that any expenses of administration of any of these plans would, as contemplated by the Imperial Economic Committee,be charged to the  1,000,000.PLAIT I.13. Should an Executive Commission be appointed it might consist; of a Cabinet Minister as Chairman (who would be responsible to Parliament), of other Ministers or officials representing the Departments interested, and of three or four persons of general experience, one or two of whom should have some scientific knowledge.    This Commission would be responsible for the allocation or direct expenditure of the money.   It would be understood, however, that the Commission, while, generally having a free hand, should, nevertheless, refer larger matters of policy to the Government for decision and would not initiate any important new scheme without obtaining the general approval, in principle, of the Government.   A body of the type suggested would naturally not itself undertake executive work which could be in any way performed by existing Departments, but would entrust to them the execution of the schemes which it approved.   The expenditure incurred by Departments would be met by grants-in-aid and would appear In the estimates of the Departments concerned and be accounted for by them.     In the matter of publicity under this plan it would have to be decided whether&apos;this work
cii 9 9 ii hishould be undertaken by this Commission or by the Board of Trade whose duty it would be in that oase to consult as occasion demanded with the other departments concerned, which is the arrangement suggested under Plans II, III and IV.PLAN II.14. The second plan is that the Commission should be framed on the lines of the existing Development Commission. This Commission is not executive but Is an independent advisory body constituted as Royal Commission under the authority of an Act of Parliament.   It does not operate under the Chairmanship   of a Cabinet Minister; it makes recommendations to the Treasury for the expenditure of money in respect of definite schemes, but the administra-tion of the money and tho oarrying out of the schemes are then undertaken by or through existing Government Departments. The Government Department concerned does not usually itself oarry out the work, but makes grants to other bodies for the purpose.    Thus in the case of Agricultural research, the work is carried out by Research Institutions,   (usually connected with Universities) which are In themselves independent organisations, but receive grants from the Development Commission through the Ministry of Agriculture or the Scottish Board of Agriculture which exercise a general administrative control.    In certain oases where no existing organisation is available the Development Commission I has encouraged the formation of special bodies or societies to organise and promote the objects in view, but still subject to general oversight by a Government Departmait.    In certain oases work has been undertaken by a Department direct.PLAN III.    .15. The third plan is to make the Commission wholly consultative in character, merely to advise the Ministers concerned on matters laid before it.    So far as its
Oj n g &amp; ij a constitution is concerned it might consist of a Cabinet Minister as Chairman, of other Ministers or officials representing the Departments interested, and the Imperial Institute, and of three or four persons of general experience, one or two of whom should have some scientific knowledge . Such an Advisory Council would make recommendations af ter enquiry, but the decision as to the particular objects upon which money should be spent and as to the allotment of funds between the several purposes whioh might be approved, would remain with the Government.   The Commission might also be used from time to time by the Ministers ooncemed to advise on plans for carrying out the general recommendations which the Imperial Economic Committee might make, for instance, on general questions of policy in regard to publicity and as to the particular lines of Empire produce (vide paragraph 19 of the Report of the Imperial Economic Committee) upon whioh publicity oould from time to time usefully be concentrated. Under this plan the most suitable arrangement would be for the money alloted to appear In the usual way on the Votes of the responsible departments and to be administered by them.PLAN IV.16. The fourth, plan would be to dispense altogether with any central executive or advisory body.   In so far as consultative committees were necessary they would be set up either separately or jointly by the Department or Departments concerned.   The work involved in carrying out the recommendations of the Imperial Economic Committee would be entrusted to the separate Departments and would be performed by them under the direct responsibility of the Minister concerned.   In order, however, to co-ordinate the activities of the several Departments concerned the Ministers in question might become a small Committee (for which the Cabinet
to o ,1Secretariat would supply the staff) whose duty it would be, subject to the general approval of the Treasury, to allocate each year the grant on the basis of recommendations from the Departments?    to approve the programme of work; and to issue each year a Report summarising the expenditure from the various Votes on which the money had been spent and detailing the activities of the Departments.
