-CONFIDENTIAL. LIBRARY, 329IS document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. EMERGENCY     ARRANGEMENTS. MEMORANDUM     BY      THE     MINISTER     OF     .LABOUR.?.4tfS.(S5) , . --              in the Report (CP. 457 (25)) of the Supply andTransport Committee placed&quot;before the Cabinet there arecertain matters of polioy about which decisions are required.The main question to be decided is not whether the Governmentare to be ready with measures to meet an emergenoy - as tothat we are all agreed - but whether these measures are tc-Inolude the immediate public   enrolment on a large scale of volunteers for emergenoy purposes.It might perhaps be best, and it is certainly easiest,to consider first whether such enrolment is likely to be successful or is practicable.    I am told that the expertshave advised that it is impracticable.    I think that this is undoubtedly true.     When a crisis comes men&apos;s minds arestirred, and the number of offers made in July to theRailway. Companies is evidence that they will   then be willing tscome forward.     But the same men will be less willing in .cold blood to bind themselves by some indefinite obligationfor the future.      if this is true generally, it is Especiallytrue of working&apos;men and yet it is just these.-        o.g. lorrydrivers whose services it is desired to secure in advance by enrolment.    They would be committing themselves blindly,as they could not foretell what would be the circumstancesof the crisis in which they might be summoned to serve andthey would be liable meanwhile to continual oritioiem fromtheir fellows.     Let it be further remembered that it wouldbe disastrous to attempt such an enrolment and fail./If
If the deoiBion be, as I believe,, that such an ,onrolment ie impracticable,  then it may be idle to consider -the light in which it would he regarded if it were practicable and successful.     But it is useful to remember that the large majority of recruits would inevitably be from classes other than manual workers.     The result would be to emphasize the division of classes.     Every effort would of course be made to represent the enrolled body as a mere strike-breaking organisation.      It is quite likely that it would be so regarded even by our own supporters among trade-unionists.In his speech at 3righton on October 8th,  the Prime Minister declared the policy of the Government.     That policy was, first, to make the utmost efforts to secure industrial peace, and then,  in the event of a stoppage, to maintain law and order.     That, he said, is its first duty.     Its other duty is to ensure that the life and well-being of the community are not endangered.     This second duty arises out of and is compelled by the latent intention in every community to protect itself.This is the policy to which all Governments must adhere. What does it involve?1,     The Cabinet has already decided that secrecy is not essential.      I believe that we should avoid any endeavour either to hide or to parade what we are doing,g.     What is required and what is wise is to work out the skeleton of an emergency organisation,  the departments into which it should be divided and the duties of each.    This has already been worked out very largely by the Supply and Transport Committee.3.     The Emergency Scheme should be fitted as far as possible into the normal machine of Government, both central and local, and the staffs both at headquarters and in local centres be brought into being and made to study their duties.
4.     We must necessarily rely on outsiders, if and when the emergency arises, and it should be, therefore, the business of the permanent officers concerned to acquaint themselves with those outsiders who are likely to be found pivotal persons.     In this latter category are included both those engaged in essential Services, e.g., hauliers, and also individuals whose general leadership would gain volunteers in each locality.5.     It may be true that in July last we had not sufficiently developed the system and the staffs of an emergency organisation.   But we ohould not   now run to the opposite extreme of attempts at over-elaboration in advance, either in the way of public enrolment or otherwise,  e.g., of trying to work out the possible tonnage requiring haulage in each centre and to make provision for all the drivers. A few smi*ll very vital Services,  e,g., of the skilled staff at the power stations, may need special arrangements. Generally speaking, however, if the central departments are instructed, in association with their local officers and with the local government officers, to prepare the plans for a scheme, I think there is little doubt that a scheme can be evolved which will require a minimum of outside support in normal times, but which can be relied upon to secure all necessary outside support as soon as an emergency exists.Two points may be mentioned in conclusion. 1.     A decision against enrolment need not mean that the Home Secretary should not enrol a larger force of special constables.8.     There is no reason why the 0..M. S. should not continue its work.     But no step should be taken which would mark it out as under the patronage of the Government, or in other words, Government enrolment by alias.(Intld.) A. S.-M.Ministry of Labour. November 6th,  1985.
