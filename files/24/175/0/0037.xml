(2?).ROSYTH DOCKYARD.I am directed by the prime Minister to circulate the accompanying Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.,(Signed)   -K. P, A, hankey,Secretary to the Cabinet.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. October 20th, 1925.I am sorry to say that, as you are aware, I shall not be at Wednesday&apos;s Cabinet, when, among other things, the question of Rosyth, will come up for discussion.I dissented with reluctance from the views of.the majority of the C.I.D. Sub-Committ ee, and I should never, have thought of doing so except on the. broadest grounds. I do not pretend to be a judge of the detailed reasons which have induced the Admiralty to prefer closing Rosyth to closing the dockyards in the Thames Estuary.     I have no doubt they are sound.But surely, even taken collectively, they cannot outweigh the, single consideration that the dockyards we propose to close are those most - immune from aerial attack, while the dockyards-we propose to retain could not possibly be worse situated if we came into collision with a
continental Power possessed of a large Air Force.     That a war with France is a most improbable eventuality I am, pf course, ready to admit;    but the consideration is wholly irrelevant.     Personally I do not believe there will be any first-class war in the lifetime of the youngest member of the Cabinet, least of all with France.     But we do not frame our naval and air policy on prophecies of this charaoter, nor ought: we to do so.      Were another Poincare&apos; to become responsible for French diplomacy, he would be perfectly intolerable if he thought that we were not in a position to defend ourselves.      It must be admitted that whatever we do the metropolitan area will always be dangerously vulnerable.     But we now have a chance of at least diminishing this grave strategic weakness.     Ought we to allow ourselves to be deflected from taking advantage of it by any minor considerations?It must further be remembered that in these days of industrial development much of the mechanism of a dockyard requires perpetual change to keep it up-to-date.      If Rosyth is put  (as the phrase goes)  into &quot;cold storage&quot;, it will inevitably freeze into immobility;    and when (if ever) it requires to be used it will surely be found seriously wanting,A.
