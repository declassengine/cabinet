This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government: --------       -   ^CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARYPrinted for the Cabinet, November, 1925.SECRET.Copy No.   3 0C.P. 479 (25)....THE CABINET.REPORT BY THE VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE IMPERIAL WAR GRAVES COMMISSION ON HIS VISIT TO CANADA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Major-General Sir Fabian  Ware, Vice-Chairman of  the  Imperial War Graves      Ab Commission, was requested by the Canadian Government to visit as many centres as   General possible in Canada and give an account of the work so far accomplished by the     3356 Commission.He has just returned from this visit which I think was successful not only in satisfying the Canadian people that the Commission is doing its work efficiently, but also in satisfying them that the work is being carried out in the true spirit of Imperial co-operation.I therefore circulate extracts from his Report to his fellow-Commissioners which I think will be of interest to the whole Cabinet.L. W.-E.The War Office,12th November, 1925.My tour in Canada has given me so much encouragement in our work and such remarkable confirmation of the rightness of our policy generally and in detail that I cannot but think that some account of it will be of interest to all those who framed that policy and are responsible for carrying it out.I should like to begin by expressing to my fellow Commissioners, to whom this report is addressed individually, my deep personal gratitude for their entrusting me with the mission I have now accomplished ; it has been a wonderful experience and has brought me happiness which it is difficult to describe. Perhaps I may be allowed to say that the happiness was very largely due to consciousness of the unanimity with which the Commission have acted during the last seven years on all large issues, and to memories, frequently recalled during my tour, of the way we had together surmounted difficulties known only to ourselves ; without these feelings I am sure that I should not have been able to face many of my experiences.....There were two points in particular on which I had everywhere to satisfy my audiences (1) that Canadian graves at least four, five and six thousand miles away, were being fittingly cared for: and (2) that Canadians had in no way relegated the care of. their graves to an organisation which was &quot;Imperial&quot; in the old sense, viz., that it was controlled and directed by Great Britain alone, &apos;   , sTo take first the second point, of which it is impossible to exaggerate the political and sentimental importance. I always began my lectures by explaining our constitution, leading up to the conclusion that Canada was directly and autonomously helping to look after the graves of every, other part of the Empire, just as the United Kingdom and all(b26/17)   100   11/25   w.o.p.   2108
the other Dominions were helping to look after CanadVs graves. I think I may say that &quot;flfyiataltelfce&apos;s&quot;always&quot;accepted&apos;&quot;this conclusion with satisfaction,&apos;aad&apos;&quot;fe&quot;lt&quot;thcafrit&quot;represented an imperialism of a somewhat new kind, a co-operation in which every shade of;political thought could unite. I then showed, first among the pictures, ,maps illustrating the distribution.of the thousands of cemeteries and the hundred thousands of graves of the British Empire throughout the world, pausing to observe that there were Canadian graves even in such distant countries as Egypt.....As to the first point, I found that the ground had been prepared for me by Canadians who had visited the cemeteries in France and Belgium, and my Chairman always in his introductory speech referred to the beauty of the cemeteries. I might give two examples of how this appreciation had already taken root. Mr. Ferguson, the Prime Minister of Ontario, who took the chair at the meeting in the Massev Hall, Toronto, said that after visiting, with his wife, the cemetery in which their boy was buried, they were so carried away by its beauty that they had visited as many others as possible, and on his return to Canada he had personally written over two thousand letters to bereaved relatives to tell them how the graves were cared for. The other example which I will select is a statement, made on: conversation, by a distinguished Canadian who had recently lost his wife. I will give it in his own words. &quot;Before we talk about anything else,&quot; he said, &quot; I want to say something about the work of your Commission. When my wife and I were in Australia last year several Australian women told us we ought to come back by Europe and visit our boy&apos;s grave, they said it would be such a comfort to my wife. I said&apos; i didn&apos;t&apos;see how&quot; that could be,, but they said T would find at was so ; they had been and that was their experience. Well, we went. Like everybody else, I suppose, we took a wreath and flowers, but: when we got there.it was:-so beautiful that, upon my word, we -hardly liked to put the wreath on it, we thought it would spoil it. The Australian women were right, it did comfort my wife,, and she was always- different about the boy afterwards. It puzzled me but I think I understand it. Your Commission is doing a great work.&quot; I think I expressed the feeling of my fellow Commissioners when I replied, &quot; Was there any work which brought such rewards ? &quot;Owing to. the General Election many of the political leaders were unable-to attend my meetings as they had intended. Mr. Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister, Mr. Meighen, Leader of the Opposition, and Mr. E. M. Macdonald, Minister of Defence, wrote to me evpressing their regret at being unable to do so and their great interest in my tour. Sir Robert Borden, however, presided at the meeting in Ottawa. It was he who, as then Prime Minister of Canada, moved the final resolution at the Imperial Conference of 191 7, establishing the Commission. Iam told that the attendances were affected by the elections, but though they varied they were always satisfactory. They differed in numbers from the very large audience at Toronto to between two and three hundred at Guelph, where the meeting was held in the University Hall some way out of the town, and- it rained heavily and unexpectedly during the afternoon andevening.....With the exception of a Sunday at Niagara, I was always moving,the stays at different places being used for visiting cemeteries in the neighbourhood containing war graves.   About these I. should like to say a few words.It Was not until in Canada I had seen with my own eyes our uniform headstones (here owing to the weather they have to be made of granite, a gray variety of which has been selected) marking the graves in the cemeteries wherever I went, that I fully realised what a unique Imperial monument the headstone itself is. It stands out, easily picked up and dignified, in cemeteries in ;all: parts of the country from Quebec to the borders of Yukon, some of them hundreds of miles from the railroad. . . . Where there are considerable groups of graves the Cross of Sacrifice has been erected, and in such places, as Winnipeg, Toronto, Hamilton and London, there are&apos;beautiful replicas of the cemeteries in France though, as in the United Kingdom,&apos; flowers are not planted. All I saw-were admirably kept, and . . . . I feel&apos; that I cannot speak too highly of the thorough, efficient and reverent spirit in which our Canadian Agency under Colonel Osborne has been carrying out its work.At Quebec. I was interested to notice that our Cross of Sacrifice had been used as the public War&apos;Memorial erected by the City ; it is in;a striking position-just outside the old walls:-and I found that it was a matter of common knowledge that this-was the monument used in the&apos; British War Cemeteries all over the world.Owing to the short time at my disposal I was unable to go further west than Brandon. Ir was very strongly pressed to continue my tour hut .... I bad to return to England even before I ihad paid a second visit to Ottawa whereT had arranged to see&apos;Lord Byng the Governor-General, Mr. Mackenzie-King and vMr. Meighen, and also to broadcast my lecture.   (Mr. Macdonald the A Minister- of&apos; Defence I visited&apos;at his home
in Pictou, Nova Scotia, and explained fully tomim, the competent Minister, the-difficulties the United Kingdom had encountered in arriving at its decision as to the Endowment Fund). I have been asked,.and very strongly advised, by authoritative people to return next year to complete my tour in Canada, going as far as Vancouver and in particular Sir Robert Borden suggests that I should visit as many places as possible in the Middle West where he thinks the message as to Imperial co-operation might be told with advantage. Of course I could have gone there on this tour if I had not visited the Maritime Provinces which the Englishman travelling in Canada is so often compelled to omit from his itinerary. I am very glad as I look back on my time in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, that I did not pass them by.I landed at Quebec on ISth September where I delivered my first lecture. I had arrived prepared to give the lecture in French, but on the advice of two distinguished French officers .... and of Lieut.-General Sir Richard Turner, V.C., who took the Chair, I spoke in French at the beginning and end only of my lecture. There were a number of French people present and this arrangement appeared to meet with their approval. I everywhere began and ended my lecture in the same-words, and these at Quebec I gave in French and English. I opened by telling the audience how the King, when thanking us at Vimy in 1922, on the occasion of his Pilgrimage, for having installed his private telegraphic apparatus in his railway coach, remarked, &quot;I am now in touch with all the Capitals of the Empire,&quot; and how His Majesty then told us of the message he had sent through Lord Byng to the people of : Canada : -&quot;Passing the night -at Vimy, my thoughts are with you.&quot; At the-close I quoted the following extract: from the King&apos;s speech at Terlincthun : - -   -&quot;Never before in history have a :people thus dedicated and maintained individual memorials to their fallen, and, in the course of my pilgrimage, I have many times asked myself whether there can be more potent advocates of peace upon earth through the years to come than this massed multitude of silent witnesses to the desolation of war. And I feel that, so long as we,have faith in God&apos;s purposes,.we cannot but believe that the existence of these visible memorials wilL eventually, serve to draw all people together in sanity and self-control, even as it has already set the relations between our Empire and our allies on, the deep-rooted bases of a: common heroism and a common agony.&quot;Colonel Vanier made a very moving, and eloquent speech at the close of my lecture and I should like to place on record my deep appreciation of the warm kindness and sympathy shown me during my stay in Quebec by many French people. The Lieutenant-Governor, Monsieur. Perodeau, attended my lecture, and went out of his way to. thank me for the message I brought them.On the day following my lecture at Quebec I took the night train to Halifax. Here, as elsewhere, I had a number of official visits to. pay and cemeteries to inspect. On the day after.my lecture, General Thacker took me by launch to view from the sea our Naval Memorial to Canadian Sailors ; we landed and inspected it closely. I think our Canadian Agency has here, as everywhere, done.its work very well: the monument is strikingly designed and well and strongly.constructed.;,   .....From Halifax I went by car over perfect roads to visit Mr. Macdonald.at Pictou,, and from there by boat to Charlottetown, Prince Edward&apos;s Island.   ...   .   .   Here I was first struck with the freshness. and really beautiful artistic treatment, controlled by British dignity and restraint,, which characterised -all the public war memorials. At St.. John, New Brunswick, to which. I proceeded from Charlottetown,. the memorial in the public square,, lit up by searchlights at night, is in conception and execution ,one which will convey to posterity the noblest sentiments of the generation which fought, the war. I cannot comment on all . ,. . . but : I cannot omit to mention the stained glass windows in St. paul&apos;s Presbyterian Church, Montreal, commemorating the Montreal Highlanders.At St. John, Sir Douglas Hazen, the Chief Justice, presided at my lecture. He lost a son in the War, and&apos; . at the Imperial War Conference, ,1917, was the . Canadian Representative whom we consulted, in drafting our Charter. On the morning after the lecture I visited the Soldiers Plot in the St., John Cemetery . ... . TL- Plot was beautifully designed and maintained, and here, as elsewhere, the Union Jack; is hoisted and lowered morning and evening over the war graves:From St. John I had a long journey to Montreal, where a very large , and repre-sentative audience came to the lecture   ....On visiting the cemeteries round Montreal ..   .   . ...   I. first came into touch withthe work of the Canadian &quot; Last Post&quot; Fund.   This organization sets an example in the
way in which it provides  or the decent burial of all ex-sailors and soldiers who have no relatives who can provide for it themselves. Close to our war plot in Montreal and elsewhere are groups of such graves with their simple flat markers, representing many units of the British and Canadian Services and eloquent of the Naval and Military history of the Empire during the last fifty years or more.From Montreal I went to Ottawa, where I met our old friend and former Commissioner Sir George Perley, who invited Sir Robert Borden and other distinguished Canadians interested in our work to meet me. Sir Robert, as I have already mentioned, presided at my lecture, which was largely attended. From Ottawa I went to Winnipeg, spending two nights in the train .... General H. D. B. Ketchen, Commanding the District, presided at my lecture on Sunday evening, which was very well attended. On the following day I addressed the Winnipeg Canadian Club at lunch. The second half of my address here, as at Toronto, to the British Empire Club, I devoted to an account of the constitution and organization of the Imperial War Graves Commission, which I claimed to be the first successful experiment in true Imperial co-operation. I visited the war plots in the Winnipeg Cemetery ; the grouping of our headstones round the Cross of Sacrifice was very effective   ....On the following day, at Brandon, I touched the edge of the Prairies. I was met at the station by General Kirkcaldy and a deputation of ex-service men, and went, amidst threatening snow, to visit the war plot in the cemetery. The war cross is very effectively sited near the main road. At the lecture I met, among other interesting people, a Canadian Chaplain who had been with the force at Vladivostok and was anxious&apos; to know the fate of the monument they had built over the War Graves there.From Brandon I turned back over the railway to Fort William and Port Arthur, towns separated from one another by only a twenty minutes&apos; car run, but proud of their inter-independence and demanding its recognition by two distinct lectures. The audiences in both cases justified the duplication of effort.....From Port Arthur I took another long railway journey to Toronto, where I addressed the largest of my meetings in the Massey Hall on Sunday evening. It was an extremely impressive meeting ; the audience was one with very strong Imperial feelings and contained many relatives of the dead. The response to the reference &quot;to Imperial co-operation in our work was very marked, and the Chairman (Mr. Howard Ferguson, Prime Minister of Ontario) referring to the story I had to tell, said that it was &quot; the most interesting and wonderful story ever told in Toronto.&quot; It was typical of the attitude of the audience that before the &quot; Last Post &quot; and National Anthem they sang &quot; Lead, Kindly Light &quot;, and sang it with a sincerity free of all lesser sentiment as I have never heard it sung before.Toronto is the national headquarters of the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, and on the following day the Order entertained me at luncheon. The speeches all emphasised the Imperial nature of the message I had brought them &quot; it was the greatest Imperial lesson we have had in &quot;Canada for many a long day &quot; said one of the speakers and I was asked to convey to the Imperial War Graves Commission the profound gratitude of the women of Canada for the work they were doing. I was then given the opportunity of thanking the Order, on behalf of the Commission, for the way in which they had organized my tour. .... Their kindness to me personally, wherever I went, was so great that it was in itself a proof of the unreserved approval, which they constantlyexpressed, of the way in which the Commission are carrying out their work.....The plots of war graves here were all admirably maintained, and that at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, with a beautifully sited Cross of Sacrifice rising among the headstones, is only equalled in beauty in Canada by that at London, Ontario.After Toronto I gave lectures on succeeding days, first at Hamilton, where General Mewburn (formerly Minister of Defence) took the chair, and where the audience was almost too big for the accommodation available ; then at Guelph where I was received by another former Minister of War (Mr. Hugh Guthrie) and last at London, Ontario, where General King, Commanding the District, took the chair and where, in ways, the meeting was one of the most striking which I held. In all these places I visited the war plots and graves in the local cemeteries and found the same high standard maintained. I then visited the war graves in a number of cemeteries around Niagara, where I took a Sunday off, returning to Toronto to address the British Empire Club on &quot; A successful experiment in Imperial co-operation.&quot; &apos;At Toronto,I received a, cable from, England telling me that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had advanced the date for the submission of ,our estimates and,   . I had, very regretfully, to abandon my engagements in Ottawa.   I had, however, been able to discuss details of the endowment question fully with Mr. Macdonald at Pictou ana
. it was not necessary to discuss it with the Prime Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition, though I had arranged to do so; letters I received from both of these had confirmed the keen interest they have always taken in our work of which they have been two of the strongest and most sympathetic supporters.I should add that throughout my tour I received the best possible support from the Canadian Press. Excellent reports were given of each of my lectures and in almost all towns I visited the newspapers published articles or commented on the work of the Commission before and after my meetings.To those who know Canada it is unnecessary for me to say anything as to the open-hearted hospitality and friendliness with which I was everywhere received. The impression it has left on my mind will never be effaced. I am still asking myself where the British Canadian man of whatever class gets his fundamental gentleness from ; it is something rather different from any quality possessed by us in other parts of the Empire and one is proud to think that it is a development of the British character.FABIAN WARE.Zrd November, 1925.
