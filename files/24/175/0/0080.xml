All classes of applicants, men, women and juveniles, have shared in the reduced figures. While the greatest reduction occurred in the men&apos;s registers, nearly 74,000 fewer men being,recorded as not at work at the 26th October than at the 28th September, a larger proportionate decrease was shown in the number,of women on the registers, and this figure at the 26th October was substantially less than at the corresponding date last year.Compared with a year ago, the total figures of persons on the registers on the 26th October were greater by 29,167. At the end of September the increase over last year was 136,839. A considerable amount of lost ground was thus regained during October, and, as will appear from the latest figures given below, the numbers unemployed have now reached a point below that for the corresponding date of last year, in spite of the fact that unemployment is greater than a year ago in a number of important industries, including coal mining, the woollen and worsted trade, and shipbuilding.

(B.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 26th October, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 1T4, as compared with 12*0 at the 21st September, with 11-0 at the 27th October, 1924, and with 11&apos;7 at the 22nd October, 1923.The figures of unemployment in respect of a number of the chief industries for the 26th October, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month and with a year ago, are given in the table below: 	Unemploy-ment Books	Increase ( -f-) or Decrease ( - ) as compared with 			Industry.

Although employment generally amongst coal-miners was still bad, the percentage unemployed at the 26th October being 19&apos;9, improved conditions were reported from practically all areas except South Wales, and the reopening of pits or increase in the number of days worked caused a reduction of nearly 46,000 in the figures. The favourable reports respecting the American cotton crop are stated to have had an encouraging effect on the Cotton Trade, which showed a further improvement during October. The reduced working hours continued in operation in the American Spinning Section, but in most of the principal districts there was a decline in the numbers unemployed and also in under-employment. Continued improvement in the Woollen and Worsted Trades reduced the figure of insured persons unemployed by over 6,000. Unem-ployment in the Iron and Steel Trades decreased by over 4,500 to the lowest figure reached since February of this year, and there was also a slight improvement in Pig Iron Manufacture and in the Tinplate Trade. Other industries directly affected by improvements were the Hosiery, Carpet, Boot and Shoe, and Pottery Trades.On the other hand, a further slight decline occurred in the Shipbuilding Industry and in Marine Engineering, and employment in both was very bad. In Building there was a slight seasonal increase in the numbers unemployed, but
employment continued good in most districts with skilled workers except painters. Increased unemployment in other industries was largely of a seasonal character.Generally speaking, the October returns show a slight improvement during the month in practically all the chief industries except Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering, but the position at the end of the month had not quite reached the level of a year ago. Comparative figures show that the Goal Mining and Ship-building Industries and the Woollen Trade are among the principal trades in which unemployment is worse than last year, but that substantial improvement has taken place in the Cotton Trade, in Engineering (except Marine Engineering), Construction and Repair of Motor Vehicles, and the Metal Trades.(C.) Latest Figures.The latest figures of unemployment published are those for the 9th November and give the total numbers on the registers as 1,198,126. This shows a decrease on the previous week&apos;s figures of 9,486, and of 20,266 as compared with a year ago. Added to a decrease of 24,784 in the previous week, the reduction in the figures since the 26th October amounts to 34,270. The distribution of the fortnight&apos;s decrease over the various industries is not definitely known, but a geographical analysis shows that reduced unemployment is reported from Wales (15,000), the North-Eastern Division (11,000), the North-Western Division (3,000) and the Midlands (4,000). There was also a slight reduction in the figures for Scotland. Little change occurred in the Southern Counties.A. STEEL-MAITLAND.SIinistry of Labour,November 20, 1925.
