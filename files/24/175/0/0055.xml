Prom the Minutes of the 204th Meeting it will be seenthat the specific questions the Cabinet are asked toconsider aro:-(i) A proposal for the introduction of legislation authorising the Board of Trade to call for returns of stocks of food supplies.(ii) Whether the announcement to be made inParliament with regard to the Government&apos;s policy on Agriculture should include a statement to the effect that a subsidy for food supplies was not justified on the grounds of defence policy^3.     As regards the first question, viz. returns of stocksof food supplies, the present position is that the Boardof Trade can only obtain information on a voluntary basis.
The Committee of Imperial Defence were informed thrt the information regarding wheat was accurate and was furnished readily;    that regarding meat in cold storage, the information was also probably accurate, but was supplied reluctant ly.4.     The War Book, as approved by tho Committee of Imperial Defence, provides, inter alia, that immediately on the declaration of the precautionary stage tho Board of Trade would submit a return to the Cabinet showing the general food position in the country.    In the absence of legislation this return would be based only on voluntary information. The Board of Trade have, however,  drafted Defence Eegula-tions which would give them powers after the outbreak of war for securing returns of all food stocks on a compulsory basis.   Also immediately on the declaration of the war stage the Board of Trade would institute a Section for dealing with returns of food stocks, otco, and for under-taking a general survey of the food position. 5.      The Conmittoe of Imperial Defence were informed that the Food Commission in their first Report bad endorsed the earlier recommendations of the Binlithgow Committee that legislation should be enacted for the submission of returns regarding the stocks of meat in cold storage. 6.    The first point, therefore, for the Cabinet to decide is as to whether, in view of the advantages from tho point of view of defence and of the recommendation of the Food Commission,, they should introduce legislation with a view to securing more accurate information in regard to food stocks.    If the answer were in the affirmations-tive a further quest ion would arise, namely, as to whether the legislation would be confined to returns in regard to meat in cold storage, as recommended by the Food Commission, or would extend to other forms of foodstuffs.

As regards the second question, viz. whether, when the Governments policy on Agriculture is nnnouncod, a statement should he included to the effect that a subsidy for food supplies is not justified on grounds of defence policy, it will he seen from the attached papers that the Admiralty are rather less confident than they were and have expressed the opinion that ,fwhile they hoped to have the submarine menace in hand by the end of three months of war they are of opinion that the country should take every other precaution against starvation&quot;.

Payne of the Board of Trade to the Secretary,Committee of Imperial Defence.Board of Trade, S.W.1, My dear Hankey, May 16, 1925.I SHOULD like to refer you to your letter of the 26th February, 1924, in which you asked me to let you have some information as to stocks of food in the country. I sent you a reply on the 29th April, 1924, respecting supplies and stocks of wheat, and also as to supplies of meat, saying at the same time that information as to stocks of meat would not be obtainable until later. My letter and its enclosures were printed in C.I.D. Paper 487-B.We have now received from the greater number of cold storage establishments at the ports particulars of the stocks of frozen meat which they held at various dates from the 31st December, 1923, to the 31st December, 1924. These have only been secured with some difficulty, but you may have noticed that the Food Prices Commission repeat a recommendation already made by the Linlithgow Committee that cold storage proprietors should be required to furnish statistics of their stocks. If these recommendations are acted upon, figures as to meat held in cold storage will be more readily available in the future.Yours sincerely,H. A. PAYNE.Eeport on Stocks of Meat in Cold Storage.Appended is a table summarising the returns received of the stocks of frozen meat in cold storage warehouses at the principal ports in Great Britain. The total storage capacity of the warehouses usually containing frozen meat at the principal ports is 34,152,000 - cubic feet, and returns were received from warehouses with a capacity of 32,787,000 cubic feet, or 96 per cent, of the whole. Information was refused in respect of warehouses of 550,000 cubic feet, there was no reply from warehouses aggregating 775,000 cubic feet, and no application was made to one small warehouse of 40,000 cubic feet. Application was also made to warehouses aggregating 1,188,000 cubic feet on the supposition that they were meat stores, but the reply throughout was &quot;no stocks,&quot; and they have not been included in the table.Warehouse-keepers were asked to classify their stocks into frozen beef in Quarters, frozen beef boxed (excluding offals), frozen mutton and frozen lamb. Judging by the experience of the last war, the military authorities are only [13115]
interested in frozen beef in quarters and frozen mutton; in mutton they are chiefly concerned with wether mutton, but it was not found practicable to try to separate wether mutton from ewe mutton in the statistics. Reckoning a quarter of beef as averaging 170 lb. and a carcase of mutton as averaging 56 lb., the table can be reduced to the following summary for military purposes : Stocks on.	Frozen Beef in Quarters.	Frozen Mutton.	Tons.	Tons.December 31, 1923	15,200	8,700March 31, 1924	4.800	11,400June 30, 1924	20,000	16,000September 30, 1924    ..	27,600	5,900December 31, 1924	7,900-	3,900The considerable variation in the stocks suggests that it would be desirable to have monthly particulars of stocks for military purposes. The most casual scrutiny of the table shows that only London and Liverpool are of any continued importance as containing stocks of frozen quarter beef; Manchester, Cardiff, Southampton and Newcastle-on-Tyne come next, but a long way off. On the 30th September, 1924, when the stocks of frozen beef in quarters were at a maximum, 61&quot;44 per cent, of these stocks were held in London, 23&quot;19 per cent, in Liverpool and Manchester, 12&quot; 12 per cent, in Cardiff, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Glasgow and Southampton, and 2&apos;95 per cent, in other ports. Mutton stocks were at their greatest on the 30th June, 1924, when 74&quot;89 per cent, were held in London, 19&apos;55 per cent, in Liverpool and Manchester, 3&apos;61 per cent, in Cardiff, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Glasgow and Southampton, and 1&apos;95 per cent, in other ports. As a ton of frozen beef stows in about 100 cubic feet (mutton in a little more), it is plain that there is plenty of storage space, even after allowing for space wasted in sorting to marks.It will not be possible to continue this return of stocks on a voluntary basis. So far there has been very little objection to furnishing the information for the limited period for which warehouse-keepers were told that they would be asked to supply particulars. Out of all the firms to whom application was originally made, only (I think) three controlling less than 3&apos;8 per cent, of the storage capacity refused or neglected to give information. More recently, however, proceedings before the Royal Commission on Food Prices have caused some irritation, and it was only with considerable difficulty that I was able to persuade the controllers of the Union Cold Storage Company (Limited) to allow the manager to give us particulars of the stocks held in the Company&apos;s cold stores on the 31st December, 1924. Had it not been for the long time spent in those efforts of persuasion this report could have been made much earlier, but a statement of meat stocks not including those of the Union would have been useless.It must be very clearly understood that it tuas an express condition, on the faith of which the particida,rs on which this report is based were furnished, that the figures should not be published in any form, and that they should, be used for the confidential information of His Majesty s Government and of His Majesty&apos;s Government alone.(Initialled)      H.

Papers Nos. 113-B, 133-B, 134-B, 135-B, 151-B, 182-B, 187-B, 441-B, 442-B, 444-B, 445-B, 451-B, 456-B, 458-B, 4ol-B, 473-B, 487-B, 492-B, 496-B, 600-B and 611-B.)CERTAIN questions connected with the supply of food in time of war have been standing over pending the conclusion of the Inquiries into the Diversion of Shipping m Time of War and into Air Raids Precautions respectively. As these two latter inquiries are now complete, these questions should now be considered. The first concerns the general principles on which our arrangements for food supply in time of war are based, and the second raises the question as to whether any further arrange-ments should be made for improving our information in regard to stocks of food.2. During the last Conservative Administration an investigation was carried out by the Committee of Imperial Defence into the supply of food in time of war. The question was discussed by the Committee at the 177th Meeting, held on the 12th October, 1923, when it was agreed that the Chairman should draft resolutions with regard to food supply in war suitable for announcement in Parliament.3. In accordance with this resolution the Chairman, Lord Salisbury, circulated a Memorandum on the 8th November, 1923 (C.I.D. Paper No. 461-B). Before the Memorandum had been considered by the Committee, however, there had been a General Election and the Government had changed hands.4. The Labour Government considered Lord Salisbury&apos;s Memorandum, together with other Papers on the same subject, at the 185th Meeting of the Committee on the 19th June, 1924, when Lord Haldane was in the Chair.   The Conclusion was as&quot; That Lord Salisbury&apos;s Summary on the Food Supplies in War, as contained in OLD. Paper No. 461-B, should be accepted as representing the general view of the Committee of Imperial Defence, subject to reconsideration after the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the Vulnerability of the London Docks and the Report of the Air Raids Precautions Sub-Committee had been received, and that the question as to whether any fuither action should be&apos; taken to secure further information as to stocks should be examined at the same time.&quot;5. Lord Salisbury&apos;s Memorandum (OLD. Paper No 401-B), which should be read in full, is based on a confident opinion given by the Admiralty that by the end of the first three months they would have dominated the submarine attack. The possibility of increasing the stocks of food by cultivating a larger acreage of wheat is examined, and the following calculation of the Ministry of Agriculture is quoted : Note by the Secretary.Food Supply in Time of War.follows : &quot; that even if this were to have as large an effect as the emergency measures of the War had, at the outside we could not expect to increase the stock at the period when it reaches its minimum by more than one week&apos;s supply, and probably it would not amount to anything like so much.&quot;[13583]
Lord Salisbury therefore rejects stimulation of wheat cultivation, and examines the possibility of storage. Me reaches the conclusion that &quot;by two months&apos; storage we should double the minimum stock of wheat in this country at the worst period of the .waiv&quot; If this were expanded by means of food restriction measures &quot; we shall get in all some twenty weeks&apos; supply.&quot; To the question &quot; Would such a plan be practicable, and, if practicable, is the risk sufficiently great to make it worth while?&quot; Lord Salisbury gives the following answer : &quot;The risk would only arise in the case of an unanticipated development of commerce-destroying on a considerable scale, or in che case of a war with America, and would only last-unless America controlled the Argentine until extra supplies from the latter and from the East could be organised. The answer, therefore, to the.question as to the risk is that the risk is small.&quot;The trend of his Memorandum, therefore, is to the effect that we should continue, as in the past, to rely mainly on our sea power for the maintenance of our food supplies in time of war.6. The Inquiries into Diversion of Shipping in Time of AVar and the Air Raids Precautions do not appear to affect Lord Salisbury&apos;s conclusions. These inquiries show, indeed, that in the event of a war with France we should meet with difficuities in plenty, but they would be difficulties of distribution to and within London and other towns in the clanger area rather than of bringing food supplies by sea to this country. It would appear to be almost as difficult to distribute home-produced as imported food.7. Unless the Departments specially concerned have anything to say to the contrary, therefore, and provided the Admiralty are still confident of their ability to deal with submarine atta,ck, there appears to be no reason for reversing the previous acceptance of Lord Salisbury&apos;s Memorandum by the Committee of Imperial Defence.Information a&amp;,,.to Stocks of Food.8. Shortly after the Labour Government came into office a serious dock strike occurred, during the course of which very little food was unloaded in the docks. It was thought that this incident might throw some light on the situation of our food supplies, and the Board of Trade were asked to prepare a Memorandum in regard to our stocks of wheat and meat. The general conclusion reached in the Board of Trade Memorandum (C.I.D. Paper No. 487-B) was as follows:  &quot; It would probably be safe to assume a constant figure of five weeks for port stocks and stocks in the hands of the millers, with another fortnights stock of flour in the hands of bakers and retailers, thus giving seven weeks&apos; supply, exclusive of farm stocks, which must always be seasonal in quality.&quot;The figure of seven weeks corresponds to the estimate of the Royal Commission on the Supply of Food and Raw Materials in 1905, and was assumed by Lord Salisbury as the basis for his Memorandum already quoied.9. Nevertheless, the following remarks by the Secretary of the Board of Trade in his letter covering OLD. Paper No. 487-B are not very reassuring as to the reliability of our information on the subject at any given moment: &quot; On the last three pages you will find the information which we have regarding stocks. It is very scanty, but the trade no longer publishes particulars of port stocks, as was the custom before the war. We have at present no powers to require merchants to make returns of their stocks to us, and a voluntary inquiry would involve such serious risks of incompleteness that it would probably be misleading.All that we can say with any definiteness is that stocks are less than they were before the war, and perhaps less than they were a year ago. For the present, at least, it would seem that living from hand to mouth has become a constant feature of the commercial policy of the grain trade.&quot;10. So much for the grain supply. So far as meat was concerned, the figures given by the Board of Trade showed that during 1923,47&apos;8 per cent, of the supplies of beef, veal, mutton and lamb to Great Britain and Ireland were raised at home, The remainder was imported.11. In May 1925 the Board of Trade forwarded further information to the Committee of Imperial Defence supplementing that given in OLD. Paper No. 487-B in regard to stocks of meat (OLD. Paper No. 609-B).   The information they forwarded
had been secured voluntarily from the trade, but not without considerable difficulty, and on the distinct understanding that it should be used for the confidential information of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of His Majesty&apos;s Government alone. The quantities of meat in cold storage at different times of the year were shown to vary very considerably, and the Board of Trade suggested that it would be desirable to have monthly particulars of stocks for military purposes. London and Liverpool were found to be the only places of any continued importance as containing stocks of frozen quarter beef ; Manchester, Cardiff, Southampton and Newcastle-on-Tyne came next, but a long way behind.12. In their covering letter to C.I.D. Paper No. 609-B the Board of Trade point out that the Food Prices Commission had repeated a recommendation already made by the Linlithgow Committee, that cold storage proprietors should be required to furnish statistics of their stocks.As long ago as February 1914 a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Supplies in Time of War, whose Report was approved at the 125th Meeting on the 3rd March, 1914, made the following similar recommendation : &quot; The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries should take steps to obtain more accurate information than is at present available regarding the stocks of food-stuffs in the country at various periods of the year, more especially in the case of the less perishable commodities, the stocks in the hands of producers,&quot;13. Thus, in 1925, we are face to face with precisely the same difficulty as in 1914, of incomplete information in regard to food stocks, and, so far as meat is concerned, both the Linlithgow Committee and the Food Prices Commission, approaching the question from an entirely different point of view from that of the Committee of Imperial Defence, have made recommendations in favour of more adequate information.14. The matter has not been overlooked, however, in the preparation of the War Book. The Board of Trade Section of the War Book, dealing with Food Supply, provides inter alia that, immediately on the declaration of the Precautionary Stage, the Board of Trade shall submit a return to the Cabinet showing the general food position in the country. Immediately on the declaration of the War Stage, the Board of Trade will institute a section for dealing with returns of food stocks, &amp;c, and for undertaking a general survey of the food position. The detailed action for carrying out these duties, in co-operation with the other Departments concerned, is also set forth in the War Book. It does not include, in the present edition, any provision for legislation. Presumably the Board of Trade will rely on voluntary information, which should be readily forthcoming in such an emergency.1.5. The question for decision, therefore, appears to be as to whether reliance can be placed on the somewhat meagre general information as to the position of food stocks always at the disposal of the Government, supplemented, when war threatens, by the special arrangements provided for in the War Book, or whether it is necessary to provide for keeping up to date more detailed information in time of peace. It is understood that this latter would involve legislation.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKEY.2, Whitehall Gardens, SAW 1, September 21, 1925.

(No. M/PD. 02855/25.)Sir, Admiralty, October 21, 1925.IN the Memorandum of the Committee of Imperial Defence 626-B, respecting food supply in time of war, reference is made to the opinion of the Admiralty in their Memorandum of the 24thDecember, 1923 (OLD. 473-B), that, &quot;at the end of the first three months they (the Admiralty) would have dominated the submarine attack.&quot;I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you that they now desire to qualify this opinion. Since 1923 the conditions have been substantially altered, for the following reasons : (a.) Since 1923 the development of Anti-Submarine measures in Auxiliary Patrol craft has not progressed beyond the experimental stage owing to technical difficulties which were then unforeseen.(&amp;.) The number of destroyers the rineipal anti-submarine weapon which it is anticipated will be available in war, is now far less than was then contemplated owing to the reductions which the Government have made in the proposed programme of new construction.Under the original Admiralty proposals we should have been able to maintain over 180 destroyers, whereas under the approved programmes only 144 destroyers will be available, which, after Fleet requirements have been met, will leave very few for convoy and escort work.(c.) The Admiralty desired to build two special anti-submarine vessels in order to try them out and be in a position to produce this type quickly and in large numbers. These vessels can no longer be built, and in consequence very considerable delay must be anticipated before they could be produced in quantity.(d.) The Admiralty programme of construction of submarines, which are potent anti-submarine vessels, has been much curtailed and delayed.In view of the above changes, My Lords request that it may be placed on record that, while they hope to have the submarine menace in hand by the end of three months of war, they are of opinion that the country should take every other precaution against starvation. The anticipations of the Admiralty are necessarily based on a number of unknown factors.I am, &amp;c.(Signed)ALEX FLINT.[13723]

Minutes of 185th Meeting, Minute 3, and 200thMeeting, Minute 2.)     9THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the question of Food Supply in time of War, with especial reference to the qualification which the Admiralty desired to express with regard to the statement which they had previously made that &quot; at the end of the first three months they (the Admiralty) would have dominated the submarine attack.&quot;LORD BlEATTY said he had nothing to add to C.I.D. Paper No. 639-B, which fully stated the Admiralty views; Lord Salisbury&apos;s Paper (C.I.D. Paper No. 461-B) had been based largely on the Admiralty views contained in OLD. Paper No. 473-B, when it had appeared that we should have a greater naval strength than now seemed probable.SIR MAURICE HANKEY said that Lord Salisbury, who was prevented by illness from attending, had asked him to inform the Committee that when he had prepared his Paper (C.I.D. Paper No. 461-B) a fairly large margin of safety had been allowed. The qualification which the Admiralty had now put forward did not alter his main conclusions as regards the general policy which should be adopted, but he thought that any further Reports by the Air Raids Precautions Committee, or alterations in the Naval situation, should be examined with a view to ascertaining to what extent food supply in time of war might be affected.Mr. WOOD thought that when Agricultural policy was discussed in the House of Commons considerable pressure would be brought to bear on the Govern-ment to the effect that home production should be increased on the grounds of National Defence. This would mean more crops would have to be grown and the farmers would have to hold large stocks of grain, both of which would entail expenditure. He suggested that on the evidence before the Committee grounds of Defence did not justify a subsidy. It was a question how much emphasis should be laid on this in Parliament.SIR HENRY PAYNE, in answer to questions as to the information available regarding stocks, said that all such information provided at present to the Board of Trade was on a voluntary basis. He thought the information regarding Wheat, which was obtained from published returns, was accurate; that regarding Meat in cold storage was also probably accurate, but was supplied, reluctantly. This was possibly due to the work of the Food Commission. In time of war the Board of Trade could take compulsory powers for returns of stocks, and this action was contemplated in the War Book. He drew attention to the fact that the Food Commission had recommended that legislation should be brought into effect now for the submission of returns of stocks of meat in cold storage.[13751-2]
THE COMMITTEE agreed-    &apos; &apos; )(a.) To take note of the opinion of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty &quot; that while they hoped to have the submarine menace in hand by the end of three months of war, they are of opinion that the country should take every.other precaution against starvation.&quot;   (OLD. Paper 639-B.)(&amp;.) That Lord Salisbury&apos;s Summary on Food Supplies in War, as contained in C.I.D. Paper No. 461-B, should still be accepted as representing the general view of the Committee of Imperial Defence, subject to any further considerations which might become necessary from time to time as a result of future enquiries by the Air Raids Precautions Committee or a deterioration of the Naval situation.(c.) To recommend that the Cabinet should be asked to consider (i.) The proposal for the introduction of legislation authorising the Boardof Trade to call for returns of stocks of food supplies, (ii.) Whether the announcement to be made to Parliament with regard to the Governments policy on Agriculture should include a state-ment to the effect that a subsidy for food supply was not justified on the grounds of Defence policy.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, October 29, 1925.

November 1923.SECRET.431-B. 84(Also C.P.-448 (23).)COMMITTEE   OF   IMPERIAL   DEFENCE.FOOD SUPPLY IN WAR.(Previous C.I.D. Papers, Nos, 113-5, 133-5, 134-5, 135-5, 151-5, 182-5, 187-5, 441-5, 442-5, 444-5, 445-5, 451-5, 456-5, 458-5, and Conclusion (5) at 177th Meeting.)Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE first thing is to ascertain what stock of wheat actually in this country we may rely upon at the outbreak of war. For this purpose it is necessary to take for the stock available the lowest figure that may reasonably be apprehended. According to the figures of the Board of Agriculture, at the normal rate of consumption this figure may be taken to be seven weeks5 supply. It is, they intimate, most unlikely to fall below this even in the months of April or May, which are the worst periods in the year. Supposing war restrictions on food which I need not say include the dilution of wheat flour were at once imposed upon the outbreak of war, this seven weeks could only be prolonged to ten weeks. A more favourable view, no doubt, is suggested by the assumption which is made by some authorities that, as soon as relations become strained to the point of a threat of immediate war, we may expect a tendency, by the agency of the Government or otherwise, at the last moment to rush extra food into the country. No doubt this might be the case, but it would hardly be wise to rely upon it, in the first place because the actual catastrophe might occur with unexpected suddenness; in the second place because it might be possible for the hostile power, in anticipation of war, to hamper the export of wheat from one of our main sources of supply, either being that Power &apos;s own country, or perhaps some other country over which it has diplomatic control; and in the third place because even in the case of friendly countries/, in the circum-stances contemplated of war immediately impending, there might be a tendency to prohibit the export of wheat as a precaution. On the whole, therefore, it would be wise not to take death-bed-repentance supplies into account, and the safe course is not to put the minimum stock as larger than would suffice for ten weeks&apos; supply even under war restriction conditions. Would ten weeks&apos; supply be a sufficient margin? The answer depends, in the first instance, upon the anticipated effects of submarine warfare. The Admiralty have given us a confident opinion that by the end of the first three months they would have dominated the submarine attack.. 1m o doubt, even with submarines at their worst, some addition to the ten weeks&apos; stock would get through, and, further, assuming the Admiralty to be correct, by the end of ten weeks, the loss of shipping and, therefore, the interference with food imports would be greatly reduced, even though the enemy&apos;s submarines were not completely dominated for two or three weeks more; so that the margin of a ten weeks&apos; supply would seem to be sufficient, But before this conclusion is accepted two considerations must be borne in mind. In the first place is it reasonable to count upon there being in the next war no improvement in the art of commerce destroying ? After all, the late war was fertile in surprises, both in weapons and methods, on both sides. Have we reached the limit of human ingenuity in commerce destroying ? No doubt in time perhaps in a short time the new ingenuity would be met by counter-ingenuity, and counter-measures would be hit upon which would effectively L10853J
respond to any such new method of attack.   But we may not be able to afford the time necessary for this counter-development, and so the destruction of food imports may be effectively carried on for more than ten weeks, and we may be starved into defeat.    In the second place, the attack upon our food may not depend upon submarines at all, but may consist of depriving us of our sources of supply.   If we take the three possible enemies which we have to consider Japan, France and ...United States the danger to our food supply from Japan would be relatively small, affecting the Far Eastern supply alone, which could easily be replaced; the danger from Prance again would only be a submarine danger, with which I have already dealt;!but the danger from the United States would be an attack upon our sources of supply.   Obviously, in a war with the United States, we should lose the United States supply.   But not only this :  we should also lose the. Canadian supply, since the American forces would no doubt immediately dominate the Canadian railway system. . This would mean the loss of 43 per cent, of our present total supply.   Could this1 be made good from elsewhere ?     I believe India is an uncertain source.   I suppose extra supplies from the Australasian Dominions could be made available, but could these be organised in order to be effective within ten weeks ?   The Board of Agriculture doubt it.     If not, we should have to look only to certain European countries and to South America.   The agricultural situation in Russia is said to be improving and the Soviet Government is anxious to restore the export trade in wheat.   In a few years Russia may become a factor in the solution of the problem. Some contribution also from South-Eastern Europe may be anticipated.   But these resources can hardly, by themselves, be counted on as adequate.   As regards South America, I gather from the Admiralty, that we should have nothing to fear in a war with United States from their submarines attacking our South American trade.   If I have rightly understood the Admiralty, then it would seem that even if we lose the North American supplies, in addition to a possible European contribution, so long as we retain the Command of the Sea, we can make good a substantial part of the deficiency from South America.   The answer, however, still leaves me with a certain misgiving.   Argentina would probably have many other urgent customers, and, in any case, the Board of Agriculture say, she would not make good as much as the 43 per cent, deficiency.     Moreover, even if we may rely upon our Navy being, ship for ship, superior to the Navy of the United States for in numbers we are limited by the Washington Agreement is it certain that we could vindicate that superiority over the whole route, from South America to these shores, within ten weeks ?   Lastly, I suppose we must not leave out of account the possibility that the United States might have sufficient political control over the Argentine as for a time to prevent food supplies to us from them.     That would mean a loss to us, not of 43 per cent., but of 63 per cent, of our present supply, and if we are to con-template  these  possibilities although,   they  are  admittedly  very  unlikely  to occur the argument for a larger stock than ten weeks&apos; supply of wheat in this country cannot be entirely dismissed, if there is any practicable method of providing it.Supposing this extreme case is to be contemplated. I proceed to enquire what means there are of increasing the stock of wheat held in this country. First let us suppose that financial inducements are held out to farmers to cultivate a larger acreage of wheat. The Board of Agriculture calculate that even if this were to have as large an effect as the emergency measures of the war had, at the outside we could not expect to increase the stock at the period when it reaches its minimum by more than one week&apos;s supply, and probably it would not amount to anything like so much. The calculation depends upon taking the maximum amount of extra wheat produced in a whole year by the emergency measures of the war and dividing that amount by five, one-fifth being the proportion of the full wheat supply grown in this country remaining over in the spring of each year. The meagre figure which I have given is the result.It would seem therefore that the stimulation of wheat cultivation would be of little avail, and that there is no method of substantially increasing the stock except by storage. If it could be contrived that overseas wheat must be stored in this country for a certain number of weeks or months before it is put upon the market, it seems to follow that at any given moment w^e should have in stock in this country that number of weeks&apos; or months&apos; supply of overseas wheat available. From figures supplied by the Board of Agriculture, it is calculated that the storage of imported wheat for two months would represent a minimum reserve of 27 million hundred-weights that is, ten weeks&apos; supply. It must, however, be remembered that a portion of this is a part of the seven weeks&apos; minimum supply, the foundation figure upon
?which we are working, and the extra wheat to be accumulated by storage must be calculated at not more than another seven weeks or thereabouts. In other words, by two months&apos; storage we should double the minimum stock of wheat in this country at the worst period of the year. Or, expanding it as we did in the first instance by means of food restriction measures, we shall get in all some twenty weeks&apos; supply. I need not say that for this purpose flour must be treated in the same way as wheat..It will be asked what would be the cost of such a system? In the Report of the Royal Commission of 1904 it was calculated that the &quot;storage of wheat, when every-thing was taken into account, would cost not more than 4s. per quarter per annum. Supposing the cost in these days to have gone up by 50 per cent., then we should have the figure of 6*s. a quarter per annum, with something more for interest on the capital value of the wheat for the time it is held up. From this basis the cost per quarter for two months can be arrived at. I presume that these figures might be taken to be the same whether the stores were built by the State and a rent charged, or it were left to private enterprise to supply the buildings itself. It should be noted that the storage methods which were suggested to. the Royal Commission were more elaborate than is here described, and that something less simple might turn out to be necessary if the expedient is to be resorted to at all. In any case there would be many details, for which provision would have to be made; as, for example, upon the question whether compulsory storage should apply all the year round or only during the months preceding the lean period of the year a distinction which would materially affect the total cost but enough has been said to show the broad limits of any such plan.Would such a plan be practicable, and if practicable, is the risk sufficiently great to make it worth while ? The answer may be summed up as follows : The risk would only arise, in the case of an unanticipated development of commerce destroying on a considerable scale, or in the case of a war with America, and would only last unless America controlled.the Argentine-until extra supplies from the latter and from the East could be organised. The answer therefore to the question as to the risk is that the risk is small. As to the practicability, there would seem to&quot;be no possible remedy except storage, and storage which would handicap, in time of peace, the smooth and cheap distribution of wheat would, I imagine, at the present moment be exceedingly difficult to provide and unpalatable to the public.(Initialled) S.November 8, 1923.
