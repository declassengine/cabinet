Lindsay to Mr. Austen Chamberlain. (Received November 16.)(No. Sir,840.)Constantinople, November 11, 1925. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a report from Major Lt. E. Harenc, military attache to this Embassy, on the Turkish feeling in regard to Mosul, based on a visit which he has just paid to Angora.   I wish, in the first place, to bring out and comment on two points made by Major Harenc in this report.2. He says that in the Turkish view &quot;if the Kurds are left in Irak, given a certain amount of autonomy, and are treated properly, it will mean continuaL trouble in Turkey.&quot; I have recently made this point to you in my despatch No. 785 of the 16th ultimo, and I feel that I cannot adequately emphasise its importance. I confidently believe that autonomy in South Kurdistan is the head of the Turkish grievance against Great Britain, and that what Turks dread more than anything else is that in the eastern vilayets the young republic may have on its hands just such a distracting and exhausting problem as Macedonia constituted for the declining Ottoman&apos; Empire. In such a case well guarded frontiers and abstinence from propaganda by Irak authorities will afford no relief; for unrest in the Kurdish vilayets would grow from the mere reports of better conditions in Kurdish Irak. 1 have thrown out the suggestion that the Council of the League, if it were to award us the Brussels line, might be induced to omit from its findings any stipulation as to the grant of autonomy to the Kurds south of that line. I venture to hope that this may be possible. It would not preclude His Majesty&apos;s Government from granting autonomy eventually, but it would give them time to look around for some other policy less likely to be permanently detrimental to Anglo-Turkish relations.3. Major Harenc shows also the importance attached by Turks to the &quot; scuttle &quot; campaign waged in England by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and other newspapers. Many Turks, even influential ones, have come to think that they have only to make another Zeligowski coup, take Mosul and dig themselves in, and His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prevented by British public opinion from resenting the insult by any active measures. It cannot be denied that these opinions, so widely and confidently held in this country, might distort the judgment even of those who direct the Government.4. Maybe that in my previous writings I have not sufficiently emphasised the effect here of the yellow press campaign; it was because, while the agitation was in full blast, I knew there was nothing to be done. . But it seems to me that the &quot; Daily Mail&quot; campaign has fallen rather flat in England, and, if this is so, I cannot help wondering if something could not now be done to counteract its influence here. The moment would be very opportune. Could a parliamentary question be answered in the following sense : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have no information to the effect that the Turkish Government contemplate any coup de main against Mosul, and the troops they maintain in Irak are only such as would suffice for the prevention of normal disorder. It is hardly necessary to add that, in the case of such an unprovoked aggression as is contemplated in the question, the affair would have far more than mere local importance.&quot;5. If you see fit to make some such declaration in Parliament, may I add some minor recommendations : (a.) The declaration should not be made by Mr. Amery. The jjrinciple of Cabinet solidarity is imperfectly understood, and Mr. Amery, whose utterances are frequently reported here, is regarded as an advocate with a licence to say more than his client really means as oriental advocates always do.(b.) No reference should be made to the League of Nations. Possibly if a crisis arose the support or even guidance of the League might help His Majesty&apos;s[1116 q-2]
Government with British public opinion if help were needed; but here in Turkey, while the hostility of His Majesty&apos;s Government is justly feared, the League of Nations cuts no ice. (c.) The declaration should be broadcasted by Leefield.6. I now revert to Major Harenc&apos;s report, and note that, whereas formerly he thought the Turks were bluffing about Mosul, he has now come to the conclusion that there is no bluff and that they mean to have it, peaceably if possible; by force if necessary. I think Major Harenc may be influenced by certain psychological reactions. I myself was in Constantinople throughout September and witnessed a tremendous Mosul press campaign engineered here obviously by the Turkish authorities, and I saw that campaign shut down completely in forty-eight hours by the same authorities. Major Harenc was away throughout September (I often stood greatly in need of his advice, but I deliberately left him in England, because during what I regarded as a great bluff I would not gratify the Turks by showing even that amount of concern implied by recalling him. from leave). Major Harenc now comes in for the backwash, still lively enough, of Septembers storm, and, naturally enough, he is greatly impressed by the contrast between what he hears now and what he heard last summer. He supports his view by the observation of numerous phenomena of a more or less superficial nature, and not the least of them is one that he has not been able to mention, viz., the enormous credits assigned to the army in the budget for 1926-27 (see my despatch No. D.O.T.(A.)/.3 of to-day&apos;s date).7. Now, I have always held that the Turks will not attack us this year or next year, even if the League finds for the Brussels line. In reaching this opinion, I have, I know, often brushed aside hard facts immediately perceptible to the eye, and in the main I have based my view on the utterances of persons reliable and unbiassed and on broad considerations of Turkish policy, both internal and external. Possibly the visit which I am about to pay to Angora may shake the view which I still hold to-day, for I will admit that during the past couple of months I have given many hours&apos; thought to this question, and I have sometimes been assailed by doubts increased, I daresay, by the sense of responsibility. I trust that you, Sir, will appreciate the difficulties of one who has conceived it to be his duty to forecast the probable action of so enigmatical a body as the Turkish Government, and I will close this despatch with a discouraging quotation from. the. writings of one of my predecessors : &quot; When you wish to know what a Turkish official is likely to do, first consider what it would be his interest to do ; next, what any other man would do in similar circumstances; and, thirdly, what everyone expects him to do.    When you have - ascertained these, you are so far advanced on your road that you may be perfectly certain that he will not adopt any of these courses.&quot;. I have, &amp;c.R. C. LINDSAY.Enclosure in No. 1. Major Flarene to Sir R. Isindsay.Sir, Constantinople, November 9, 1925.I HAVE the honour to submit, for your Excellency&apos;s information, the following appreciation of Turkish intentions regarding Mosul. It is based on the information which 1 gathered in Angora during the course of convei-sation with various persons, ranging from an ex-mutessarif and an officer on the staff of the commandant-general of gendarmerie to the American delegate in Angora.2. The Turks want Mosul quite definitely, and are now prepared, if necessary, to fight for it; but they do not intend to fight until all other means of obtaining it have been proved unavailing.3. Mosul is wanted by both the thinking and unthinking Turks. The unthinking, because they have been nropaganded to such an extent that they believe it part of the fatherland ; by the thinking, for three reasons : (a.) That if the Kurds are left in Irak, given a certain amount of autonomy, and are treated properly, it will mean continual trouble with the Kurds in Turkey.&apos;
(b.) That if Mosul is now given up, after making such a point of its retention, it will definitely react against the present Government in general, and against Mustafa Kemal in particular.(c.) Rightly or wrongly they consider the Mosul Vilayet as a source of potential wealth.4. The present concentration in the south-eastern vilayets was originally made to suppress the Kurdish rebellion. Although the Kurds are still giving trouble, the size of the force now there is larger than is required for the operations now in progress, namely,- the pursuit of small isolated bands of malcontents and the establishment of the new administration ; it is therefore for another purpose.When the Kurdish rebellion was suppressed, this force was kept in being in the neighbourhood of the Mosul border as a bluff, the underlying idea being that they might, in order to avoid a possible war, possibly frighten the League of Nations into giving a decision favourable to themselves, and at the same time induce that part of public opinion in England which is averse to any expenditure outside England into raising such an outcry on the possibility of war that it would induce the British Government to come to terms with Turkey by direct negotiation. They have not yet succeeded in carrying out the first part of their scheme, nor have they succeeded in making the British Government reopen direct negotiations, but they have, from what they read in papers such as the &quot; Daily Mail,&quot; raised a strong feeling in England against incurring any expenditure for the sake of Irak. They have now decided to follow up this partial success, which is, indeed, more than they expected. The presence therefore of the troops in the immediate vicinity of the Mosul Vilayet has now become a threat.5. Rightly or wrongly, many of those responsible for the policy of Turkey believe that the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; represents the views of the &quot;man in the street&quot; in England, and when a writer like Mr. Garvin agrees with the opinions expressed in the &quot; Daily Mail,&quot; they conclude that it is safe to count upon public opinion in England not allowing Imperial forces being used to uphold a decision of the League of Nations, should such decision involve sending troops into Irak to combat any movement made by them in order to occupy the Mosul Vilayet.6. They are convinced that, should the League of Nations give a decision unfavour-able to themselves, they could, without any serious difficulty, establish themselves in Mosul and that once there, for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph, Great Britain would not be able to turn them out. They do not believe that this flouting of a decision given by the League of Nations would prove detrimental to themselves, as Europe is too much concerned with htr own affairs to take the matter up. If Greece should take this opportunity to attack them, they have three corps, the 1st, Illrd and Ivth , ready for the defence of the western front, and, should that not be sufficient, Russia is prepared both with men and material to assist them.7. The force at their disposal for the occupation of the Mosul Vilayet is estimated at between 50,000 and 60,000 men of all arms. It is an open secret that they find great difficulty in keeping the force up to this strength on account of desertion, sickness, &amp;c, the desertions being due to the reluctance of the troops to being kept under active service conditions ; consequently, fresh troops have continually to be drafted in ; this partially accounts for the recruiting activity in Turkey at this moment. A war against England would be unpopular, and would increase the difficulty of keeping men with the colours ; but, in spite of the difficulties involved, the Turks are resolved to march into Mosul should the decision of the League of Nations be unfavourable to them, for they believe that they have all to gain and nothing to lose by such action.8. The opinion expressed above is quite contrary to that which I have expressed hi my previous despatches addressed to your Excellency on this subject. I have been forced to change my opinion, as I feel that there is quite a different atmosphere in Angora now to what there was four months ago.That the feeling in official circles in Angora with regard to the chances of obtaining hold of the Mosul Vilayet has changed is, in my opinion, almost entirely due to the opinions expressed in certain papers in England, chief amongst which is the &quot; Daily Mail.&quot; I do not believe that four months ago the Turkish Government even contemplated regular operations for the possession of the Mosul Vilayet; they would have repeated the tactics which were so successful in 1920 in forcing the French to evacuate Upper Cilicia.9. Though the Turkish Government is at this moment prepared to send troops to occupy the Mosul Vilayet at any time they see fit, they would not do so if they thought there was any chance of Great Britain taking up such a challenge to her prestige.   I
consider that there are two methods of bringing about such a belief: the first, if the &quot; Daily Mail&quot; could be induced to change its printed opinions on this question, or if an effective counterblast could be raised ; the second, if a force, sufficiently strong to give the Turks at least some difficulty in marching to Mosul; could be sent to Irak before they made any definite move.I have, &amp;c.R.
