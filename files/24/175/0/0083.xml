EC RETP. 483(25).CABINET,.... mm-.--i.FIRM LICENCES FOR THE EXPORT OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.In accordance with the Cabinet decision of the 7th August (Cab.44(25)) that long term licences should be granted to B.3.A. Guns, Ltd. to export 100,000 Rifles to Greece and 1,500 Lewis Guns to Lithuania, B.S.A. Guns Ltd. have been informed that in the event of their- obtaining tho contracts export licences will be granted in these two cases valid for the period necessary to complete the orders, and that they will not be withdrawn save in the event of circumstances of an altogether exceptional character arising which the Board are at present quite unable to foresee.Aa regards the further decision of the Cabinet of the same date that where the Foreign Office, the Service Depart-ments and the Board of Trade are in agreement that there is no objection to the issue of a licence for a period of more than three months a report should be submitted to the Cabinet,, the following further applications for firm licences sub-mitted by B.S.A. Guns Ltd. have been considered by the Departments:-Material.64 Lewis Guns ,000400 )000 10 10Lee Snfield Carbines .303Aerial Bombs Prideaux Links Loading Machines Ammunition Testing Machines.Approx. Value.7,600IS,000 2,840Period&apos; for &quot;which; firm licence is j desired.       jDestination.5 months, 7 months6 monthsArgentine Govt. Latvian        &quot;Esthonian     wr A&quot;s regards No.3 a revocable licence valid for three months was -issued to the firm in July last.    This licence has now lapsed and the firm ask that it may be exchanged for a &apos;firm&apos; licence^/ ^IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.
J &apos;5?The Departments concerned do not desire to oppose the issue of long term licences in these cases?   and I propose therefore to issue the licences as requested unless any of my colleagues take objection at or before our meeting on Wednesday next.I understand the Cabinet Decision that long term licences should be granted in approved cases to imply the issue of licences   which would not be revoked during the period for which they were issued save in altogether exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.     I propose therefore that these long term licences when issued shall not contain the usual condition that they may be modified or revoked at sny time by the Board of Trade without reason given.     B.S.A. Guns have already been informed that this condition will be omitted in the licences referred to in the first paragraph of the Memorandum. If this condition were retained in the usual form a long term licence would not be regarded by the firm as having any greater value than the licences for three months which are normally issued and the firm would not be prepared to proceed with the work.I propose moreover to inform the firm when the licences are issued that they will not be withdrawn &quot;save in the event of circumstances of an altogether exceptional character arising which the Board are at present quite unable to foresee,&quot; as I have done in regard to the long term licences for which Cabinet sanction has already been obtained.(Intld.) P.C-L.Board of Trade,20th November, 1925.
