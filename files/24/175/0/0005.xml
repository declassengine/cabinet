(TEES DOCUMENT IS, THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSfY(S GOVERNMENT) 38CABIN E ^CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.SECRET.C,P ,405/25, AIRSHIP   DEVELOPMENT.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty,&apos;&quot;&quot; wIn C,P* 40/25 dated 28th January, 1925 I put before the Cabinet the&apos;Admiralty&apos;s views as to the lines upon which, in their opinion, the development of Airships in general could be most economically and usefully carried out.Briefly, the Admiralty views stated In the above were, that the proper and most economical course Is to develop Commercial Airships under the Board of Trade whose primary use In War would be Ocean Naval Reconnaissance under Admiralty control, and that consequently their peace time crews should belong to the Naval Reserve and the design of Airships should conform to Admiralty requirements as far as this can be done without depreciating their commercial value.   There is a Naval need for numbers of Airships in the air in the shortest possible period of time, in order that their capabilities for Ocean Naval Reconnaissance may be tried out ,If, however. HeM,Government decide against this coursee j the Admiralty require to know if the present Cabinet adhere to the deoision reached by the late Government, namely that the Airship now under construction by the Air-Ministry Is intended to be tried out primarily for purposes of Naval Reconnaissance .In. the present memorandum a precis is given of the past history of Airship Development in so far as it concerns      -jj the questions of the responsibility for the  control and development of lighter-than-air aircraft, the design of the particular Airship now under construction by the Air Ministry and the conditions for training personnel, etc.In 1922, Lieutenant Commander Burney put forward his scheme for the e stablishment of an Imperial Airship
Service e   The scheme was -under discussion by H.M ,Government during 1922 and 1923,  and on 1st May 1924, the then Cabinet made the following decisionso    (See&apos;Cabinet 29/24 - Copy attached as Enclosure I)A 6 &quot;That the Mr  Ministry should be authorised toproceed with the construction of a 5,000,000 cubic feet capacity airship, whose^ primary function should be Naval Heconnaissanee&quot;* B. &quot;That the conditions for training of personnel etc,,should, as recommended by the Cabinet Committee, be determined by the Committee of Imperial Defence&quot;,At a further Cabinet meeting cn 7th May, 1924 (see Cabinet 30/24 - Copy attached as JUnclosure II)  it was decided in addition:-&quot;That in order to ensure co-ordination &quot;(I) An Advisory Board  should be set up including &quot;representatives of the Treasury, Admiralty, War &quot;Office, Air Ministry, ColSnial Office and Post &quot;Office,&quot;(ii) Also a Technical Board including representatives &quot;of the Admiralty and Air Ministry, with power to co-opt &quot;other technical assistance,&quot;The functions of these Boards to be laid down by the&quot;Committee of Imperial Defence&quot;cOn 3rd October,,  1924, the Admiralty addressed a letter to the C,I0Dt requesting that early consideration might be given to the relations between the Admiralty arid Air Ministry in regard to (a) Airship Development and  (b) Conditions for training personnel, etc     and asking that the functions of the Advisory and Teclinical Boards might be laid down,    The Admiralty concluded by expressing the hope that the C.I.D. would treat the matter as a very urgent questionc
The relations between the Admiralty and Air Ministry&quot; in regard to Airship Development were subsequently the subject of discussion at the 189th Meeting of the Cil ,D\ held on 4th &quot;November, 1924 e   At this meeting the Committee had under consideration the Impressions formed by the fjhairman (Lord Haldane) as the result of a preliminary Investigation held by him into certain questions with regard to Airship Development, including that of the setting up of the Technical and Advisory Boards,   A copy of Lord Haldane 5s Note embodying these Impressions is attached as Enclosure III0As a result of the discussion of this Note, the Committee agreed to recommend&quot;That in view of the conflict of opinion as to the &quot;intentions of the Cabinet decision of 1*5*24, as affecting &quot;the responsibility for the control and development of &quot;llghter5than-air aircraft, the question should, be referred &quot;back to the Cabinet for further Instructions&quot;0The Cabinet have not given a decision on thismatter sThere is now in existence an Airship Co-ordinating Sub-Committee of the Aeronautical Research Committee*   This Sub-Committee was apparently formed after the recent breaking away of &quot;R033&quot; from Pulhama   The Admiralty Is not represented upon It and it In no way replaces the Technical and Advisory Boards which have not been set up.The position at present Is therefore that the Admiralty are not being consulted with regard to the design of this AirshipoThe Admiralty ask for an early Cabinet decision on the important questions enumerated above0The American Navy has  two large Airships  which they are operating at the present time, the following extracts

Engineers by Rear Admiral Hilary P5 Jones, U6S a Navy/who recently commanded the U.SC Atlantic Fleet, are of special interest as showing how carefully the problem of War Airships should be  considered before embarking on expensive programmes e Rear Admiral II.P6Jones&apos;s views are In agreement with the Admiralty recommendation that Airships should be developed comm e rc ia lly e&quot;The functions of the lighter-than-air ship in the operations of the Fleet are still in the investigation stage. Although the airship may transport heavier weights to much greater distances than the airplane., its vulnerability to hostile attack even with helium as the   lifting, gas renders its possible value1 in war doubtful to say the leantV   However, it is hot  safe: to make predictions     The experiments now being carried on should finally demonstrate whether or not the airship will be of real value as a unit of the Fleet\   &apos; Suggestions have been made that airships may be used as airplane carriers and- thus-furnish their own protection on the scouting line&apos; or in action&apos; against other air Craft,     &apos; Also that they may be used&apos; in the service of supply for distant operationse A simple arithmetical calculation of weights&apos;and distances will answer&apos; such suggestionso   The largest airship proposed (6,000,000 cubic feet - nearly throe times the size of the Los Angeles), allowing a safe margin of fuel&apos;,&apos; would be able to carry a free military load of only ten tons a distance of 4,000 miles *,&apos;  As&apos;she must carry fuel and stores for the return-trip, her radius will be 2,000 miles or less.   Therefore, in the service of supply, airships will prove exceedingly costly and quite inefficient,-     Let us suppose  that the ten tons- is taken up in airplanes and that the airship is an airplane

I will leave it to you to guess what would happen to the airship when such a weight is suddenly released by sending out the planes *   According to ray reasoning, there will be only two things that oan stop her this side of the moon-rarefied atmosphere or valving of gas 6     If the latter means is used, what will happen to  the airship when her planes come back to her?     Unless there is ballast to get rid of,  she must come down as she cannot carry the weight on reduced,   as, and every ton of ballast means that much less military load.&quot; *Enclosure I0  e*.   . ** Cab0 29 (24) Conclusion 10 He  * o o  *.j Cabo 30 (24) Conclusion 8, III,   o*.   ... 0,1.11;.,   522    B. 24,10*24.(Intd o)      3, C, B,

In view of his services in connection with airship research, it is con-sidered that Commander Burnoyfs Group (Vickers should be given the first offer of a contract for the construction of a commercial airship. This ship to be handed over to the Air Ministry on completion0   After satisfactory trials have been carried&apos;out, the Burney Group to bjave the option of. re-purchasing It for the sum of  150,000 provided that it is to be used for the purposes of an approved British Airship Service and that it is available for use by the State as required.

SEC HST.mCLOSURE III.522-B,C.    I.D.24.10.24,Relations of the Admiralty and AirMinistry in regard to Airship Development.Note by the Chairman, At the request of the Prime Minister and with theconcurrence of the 1st Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air, I have, in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held a preliminary investiga-tion Into the following questions which have been referred by the Cabinet for  consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence(a) The exact relations of the Admiralty and AirMinistry in regard to Airship Development,(b) The conditions for training of personnel etc.(c) The definition of the functions of the Advisoryand Technical Boards which the Cabinet has decil ed should be set up to ensure co-ordina-tlon,2.     I have convened two meetings of the representatives of the Admiralty and Air Ministry and, as a result of the discussions which then took place, I have gathered certain impressions which I now put forward for consideration by my colleagues on the Committee,3,      I would point out that the Capinet have already agreed &quot;that the Air Ministry should be authorised to pro-ceed with research and experimental stages in regard to Airships,  and the simultaneous construction of a &amp;,000,000 o\ft * capacity Airship at Cardington, whose primary function should be naval reconnaissance     The design of the Airship to be based on results obtained from their research and experimental work&quot;; and I have limited the investigation
&apos; * ** 2 &quot; EM CLOSURE III.to the at lady on the questions only in so far as they affect this particular Airship,In consequence, these Impressions are intended to apply only to this particular Airship,  and I have not taken into account their application to any other airships which it may, at any future time, he decided to construct, 4.     My Impressions are as follows(I)    That the purpose of the Airship under ddscussion Is primarily that of Naval Reconnaissance,      In order to fulfil that purpose it is essential that the Airship should he attached to the Fleet  and be under Naval, command,   aid should remain with the Fleet as long as required by it, subject to any Cabinet decision to the contrary, (ii)    That the Admiralty should, as soon as possible, inform the &quot;Air Ministry of the requirements which are considered necessary to enable suoh an airship to carry out the function of Naval Reconnaissance, (Hi)    That the Air Ministry should, as soon as possible, confer with the Technical Staff of the Admiralty on the question of the design of the Airship, In order that the Admiralty might have an opportunity of examining the design in its present stage with a view to suggesting, ouch modifications or additions, If any, as may appear desirable to enable the Airship to carry out the functions of Naval Reconnaissahcet.. (iv)    That the Admiralty should,  with the approval of the Air, Ministry, detail such technical &amp; executive pprsonuol as may appear desirable for attachment to the Royal Airship Works at Cardington, to keep In touch with the construction of the new airship as the building
&quot; 5 &quot; ENCLOSURE III,progresses; and. with any experiments carried out in connection therewith, (v)   As regards the crew and personnel in this particular airship, it ought to he commanded by an officer of the Navys    It is obvious, however, that the corn-promise embodied in the  arrangement which has given the construction of the Airship to the Air Ministry, involves the use of their exports in the working of this particular ship.    There will, -therefore, have to be an apportionment as in the case of the Garriers, though possibly taking into account other considerations than those which applied only to that case.     How the crew is to be apportioned and what part is to be Naval,  and by whom to be trained,  is a question which appears impracticable of satisfactory determination without a complete conspectus of the personnel of the ship and of the elements which that personnel must contains It is, therefore, wiser to postpone any recom-mendations on this question until full particulars cen be brought under review.24,10,1924cHaldanc ,
