[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;! Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1925.NOTE  ON  THE  SIXTH  ASSEMBLY   AND   DISARMAMENT. (Received in Foreign Office, October 5, 1925.)COMING back to the League Assembly after two years&apos; absence, certain changes were very apparent. In the first place, the personnel of the delegations, generally speaking, had grown in importance. This no doubt was due to the attendance last year of Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and M. Herriot, and this year of Mr. Chamberlain and M. Painleve. The other smaller countries have followed suit. The result was that for the first week, especially, the Assembly conveyed the impression of increased seriousness and responsibility. The only considerable exception was the Italian delegation, which was weaker and more incompetent, if possible, than it had been in previous years. This is the natural fruit of the deliberate movement by Mussolini towards war, a movement which may have very serious consequences for Europe in the near future if it be true, as I heard at Geneva, that he is now intriguing with Russia,The other change that was most noticeable from 1923 was the substitution of French for British leadership of the Assembly. In the first four years of the League the smaller countries looked to- the British Empire to give a lead. Owing to the weakness of the British policy in 1924, and perhaps even more to the weakness of the British delegation in that year, France was enabled to take our place. The almost entirely negative attitude which the British delegation took up this year strengthened that tendency. I noticed it particularly in dealing with the proposal of M. Loucheur for an economic conference. I believe that proposal was on the whole objectionable, and in previous years I think British objection to it would have sufficed to put an end to it. But as things were British disapproval was largely discounted by an impression that the British were out to object to everything. To some extent this was inevitable. A number of the proposals brought before the League were rightly unacceptable. It is unnecessary to enumerate them, but it is true that, with the exception of the slavery proposals, there was scarcely one of the minor suggestions made which could be honestly accepted by the British without considerable qualification. Even on slavery we had to resist what looked like dishonest attempts by the Portuguese delegation to destroy the proposed convention by trying unduly to extend its scope.So, too, on arbitration it was to be expected that we should take up a negative attitude. Except for last year the British delegation has always shown itself doubtful as to how far compulsory arbitration may be practicable at the present time. Whether we are right in that attitude is another matter. In practice, we as a nation always have been ready to arbitrate in any international dispute in which we have been engaged, and I do not think it at all probable that we should wish to refuse arbitration in the future. It may well be that we should do wisely to accept what is called the &quot;Optional Protocol,&quot; that is to say, the engagement to arbitrate the questions set out in the second paragraph of article 13 of the Covenant commonly called &quot; justiciable questions.&quot; I believe we should nearly always gain by arbitrating such questions before The Hague Court. Moreover, if it were thought right we could sign the optional protocol with the reservation that we should not be bound to arbitrate questions involving our national honour or vital interest or any questions arising out of warlike operations. It may be said that, that would not mean very much, but it would be unquestionably welcomed as a step towards arbitration by those States who have come to believe in arbitration with an almost unreasoning faith, and it certainly would not do us any harm.On one subject, however, I venture to think our policy was more open to criticism, i.e., on disarmament.   It was, indeed, mainly due to the line we took up-3089   [13636]
2on that question that our whole attitude became suspect. From the outset of the League the British have been advocates of disarmament in some form. This is not only true of myself, who acted on the specific instructions of the best known Dominion statesman, General Smuts, but it was also true, more or less, of the British Empire delegation itself. We were always pressing for disarmament, and it was the French, with their Polish and other satellites, who resisted it. When this year the French took up a new line and urged, at any rate, preliminary steps in a disarmament, direction, it was, altogether inexplicable to the other countries that we should be ad-opting what appeared to be an obstructive attitude. It was therefore not unnatural that people began to search for some hidden motive for what we were, doing, and the only one that occurred to them was that we were really anxious to limit the authority and activities of the League. The result was that when we, with very good reason, opposed this or that proposal, it was thought to be part of an anti-League policy rather than a genuine conviction of the undesirability of the proposal in question.As to disarmament in itself, it does seem to me that we have not only nothing to lose by any general scheme of disarmament, but we have almost everything to gain by it. The size of our present navy avowedly depends upon the size of that of other people, and a readiness to reduce it if others reduce theirs cannot possibly injure us. The same is true of our air force. In both arms economies might well be achieved if we can only get other nations to behave reasonably. As for our land forces, they are already down so low that under no conceivable scheme of disarma-ment could we be asked to reduce them further. They do not, in fact, depend on the size of the armies of other nations, but on quite other circumstances, and. I am absolutely confident that no international demand would ever be made for us to reduce our land forces. On the other hand, if the land forces of other nations were reduced, the relative strength of our army would obviously be increased. From a wider point of view, general disarmament, if it could be achieved, is of the greatest possible importance to us, apart from the fact that we are bound by treaty to, try to dp what we can to further it. I do not know what the policy of the Cabinet on this point is. I have heard some members of it express doubts as to the desirability ol disarmament at the present time, and others express even graver doubts as to its possibility. Even so, preliminary enquiry into the method and principles of disarmament, should it become possible, does not seem a very dangerous suggestion. In any case, in spite of the efforts we were instructed to make to shelve this proposal, it has-been adopted, and at the next meeting of the Council a preparatory committee of experts is to be appointed and the subjects of its enquiry are to be laid down. In December, therefore, we shall have to show our hands definitely. Either we shall be in the vanguard of these who wish the world, to disarm, or we shall be, in effect, opponents to that movement. If we mean to lead the way, as I think we ought, we have no time to lose, and the Cabinet should give definite instructions to their technical advisers to press on with the necessary investigations and enquiries here.The question is vital, and I hope we may arrive at a very definite and clear decision on the subiect without delay.R.
