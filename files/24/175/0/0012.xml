September 1925.(Ministry of Labour Industrial Memoranda, Serial No. 5.)WAGES  AND  CONDITIONS  OP  RAILWAYMEN.Present Position of Negotiations.1. The earlier stages of the wage negotiations in the railway industry were described in CP. 138 (25) and subsequent events were detailed in CP. 238 (25). This latter paper recorded the course of events up to the beginning of May 1925, when the position had been reached that, following the decision of the N.U.R. to refer their &quot; all-grades programme &quot;to the Central Wages Board (see CP. 138 (25), paragraph 7), on the condition that the Board considered the programme for all grades including railway shopmen, the N.U.R., acting on the suggestion, of the Railway Companies, invited the Craft Unions to a conference to discuss the question of setting up joint negotiating machinery regarding railway shopmen.2. The replies received by the N.U.R. to their invitation were not favourable to holding a conference as proposed. In particular, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, with whom were associated the Boilermakers&apos; Society, the National Union of Foundry Workers and the Electrical Trades Union, stated that they had no objection to a meeting being arranged for the purpose of dealing with the question of membership, and that, when that matter had been satisfactorily settled, the question of joint machinery could be dealt with. In consequence of the unfavourable replies no conference was held, and the N.U.R. decided to inform the Companies that they still pressed that the grades not covered by the machinery of the Central and National Wages Boards should, be included therein in connection with the &quot;all-grades programme.&quot;3. It will be remembered that in April 1925 the Great Western and the London and North-Eastern Companies took steps by way of dismissals and short-time working for the purpose of reducing working costs in view of the fall in revenue, due largely to the decline in coal exports and the general depression in the coal industry. The financial position of the Companies continued to give cause for anxiety, and in June an invitation was issued by them to all Unions having members employed on the Railways to attend an informal conference to hear a statement of the existing position of the Companies. This conference took place on the 25th June, when Mr. Glower, the Assistant General Manager of the London, Midland and Scottish Company, made a confidential statement to the Unions of the financial situation of the Companies.4. Subsequently the Railway . Companies communicated to the Unions their proposals for relieving the situation, the main feature of which was a temporary all-round reduction of 5 per cent, in directors&apos; fees, officers&apos; salaries and the wages of all employees, to be terminable by three months&apos; notice at any time after the expiration of one year; in the meantime, all proposals for variations in wages of the Unions and the Companies to be held in abeyance. The Unions were invited to a further conference after they had considered the proposals.5. The Executive Council of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, who, it will be remembered, were not parties to the &quot;all-grades programme,&quot; considered the Companies&apos; proposals at a meeting on the 9th July, and decided that &quot;having regard to the fact that all drivers and firemen have been on their base rates since April 1922, and also that the National Wages Board&apos;s decision in December 1923 afforded the Companies considerable relief so far as locomotive men are concerned, we cannot agree to the proposal submitted by Mr. Clower, arid hereby decide that no representative of the Society attends the further conference.&apos;&apos;i136061 bSECRET. CP. 412 (25 .CABINET,
6. The further conference took place on the 28th July, when Mr. Clower, on behalf of the Companies, met representatives of all the Unions affected, with&apos;the exception of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. At the conference the Unions intimated their rejection of the Companies&apos; proposal of a 5 per cent, cut, and the informal negotiations terminated.7. It should here be interposed that, owing to the fall in the cost of living index number, the operation of the sliding scale involved a reduction in the bonus of railwaymen of Is. per week as from the 1st July. This reduction affected only a proportion possibly one-half of the men in the traffic grades, but there is little doubt that the reduction influenced the decision of the Unions particularly the N.U.R. to reject the proposals of the Companies for an all-round reduction of 5 per cent. In Appendix I to CP. 138 (25) is a statement showing the wages of railwaymen in January 1921 and in February 1925, together with the standard rates and the excess of the February 1925 rates over the standard. A table is attached (Appendix I) showing the present rates and their excess over the standard rates.8. Following rejection by the Unions, the Companies withdrew their proposals Involving an all-round reduction of 5 per cent, and intimated their intention of proceeding with their former proposals for reductions in wages. Formal notice was accordingly given by the Companies of their claim for a reduction in the wages of the traffic grades amounting to 4s. per week in London and Industrial Areas and 6s. elsewhere; these are reductions in the standard rates, which were fixed at approximately 100 per cent, above pre-wrar rates following the strike in 1919. These standard rates were embodied in national agreements which also provided that wffiatever might be the fall in the cost-of-living index number no man&apos;s rate could fall below the standard rates, which would come into force as the permanent rates. The Companies&apos; proposals thus involve a very important modification in the existing agreements and in the basis on which standard rates were fixed. The conciliation machinery existing in the industry will be utilised and the &quot;all-grades programme&quot; of the N.U.R. and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association and the counter-proposals of the Railway Companies will be referred to the Central Wages Board. On the 5th October representatives of the Railway Companies will meet representatives of the N.U.R. and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association to discuss the items in the &quot;all-grades programme&quot; which the Companies consider cannot come before the Central Wages Board. These items include the claims made on behalf of shopmen, electrical grades on the underground railways, and pensions. The meeting of the Central Wages Board has been fixed for the 14th October. It is not expected that any settlement will be reached by the Board, who, it is anticipated, will forthwith refer the claims to the National Wages Board, which is bound to announce, within twenty-eight days of any matter being referred to it, the results of its investigation and consideration, during which period there can be no stoppage of work.Position of Traffic Grades.9. It will therefore be seen that so far as the traffic men are concerned the critical period is likely to be reached in November, when the findings of the National Wages Board have been announced.10. The danger point in the situation lies in the attitude of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and the action which their members are likely to take. This Society represents the great majority of the locomotive drivers, and, by calling upon their members to cease work, can very effectively hold up the railway system, as was demonstrated in the January 1924 strike (see CP. 138 (25), I 9). The Society are not parties to the &quot;all-grades programme &quot; and will have no claims before the Central Wages Board, but the proposed reductions by the Companies of 4s. and 6s. per week are intended to be applied to all men in the traffic grades and therefore to the members of the Associated Society. These reductions will be very strongly opposed by the Society, whose General Secretary, Mr. J. Bromley, M.P., has publicly stated that his members will not accept any reductions.11. It is not possible to give any indication of the line which the National Wages Board may take on the conflicting claims of the parties, or to make a forecast of its findings, but if the Board decides that a reduction of wages is justified in the case of locomotive drivers, there is little doubt that the Associated Society will refuse, as they did in January 1924, to accept the findings of the Board, and their members will cease work if those findings are put into operation.   The success which
attended their efforts in January 1924 will doubtless strengthen the Society in this attitude. Were it not for the attitude of the Associated Society, it could be said, almost with certainty, that the N.U.R. and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association would accept the findings of the Board even if they meant reductions for their members. These two Unions, and particularly the N.U.R., cannot, however, ignore what happened in January 1924, when a similar situation existed, and the Associated Society successfully upset that part of the findings of the National Wages Board relating to mileage payments. The N.U.R. accepted, the decision of the Board and, when the members of the Associated Society struck against the decision, instructed their members to continue working. It was, however, only with considerable difficulty that the N.U.R. were able to keep their members at work.12. Although the Companies had a very strong case, they gave way to the Associated Society, and the N.TJ.R. were &quot; let down &quot; by them. The result of this was that the N.U.R. lost a considerable number of locomotive drivers as members,, these men going over to the Associated Society. In so far as drivers retained their membership of the N.U.R., it is understood that the majority became members also of the Associated Society. If the latter Society again strike against the decision of the Board, the N.U.R. will be very apprehensive of being &quot; let down &quot; again, and circumstances may compel them to withdraw their members also.13. It should also be mentioned that the Associated Society are likely to be in a stronger position from the point of view of public opinion than they were in January 1924. The findings of the National Wages Board, against which the members of the Associated Society struck, were signed by the two representatives of the Society sitting on the Board. In view of the criticisms to which these representatives were subsequently subjected by the Executive Council of the Society and the declared attitude of the Executive Council on the question of wage reductions at the present time, there is little doubt that, if the Board comes to the conclusion that a reduction in wages is justified, the two members of the Society on the Board will this time dissent. The Society will consequently be in a much stronger position on this occasion to repudiate the findings of the Board.14. The difference in outlook between the Associated Society and the N.U.R. is illustrated in their respective attitudes towards the proposed Quadruple Alliance. The N.ILR. have suggested a number of amendments to the draft Constitution, and have stated that before such an Alliance can be brought into being it is necessary for unity to be attained between the Unions in each industry; the Associated Society, on the other hand, have decided to accept the draft constitution and join the Alliance. The possibilities of trouble in the railway industry in the near future have probably influenced the Society to some extent in coming to this decision.Position of Railway Shopmen.15. After the rejection by the Unions of the all-round cut of&apos;5 per cent., the&apos;&quot; Railway Companies reverted to the proposal for a reduction of 6s. Qd. per week in the bonus of railway shopmen (see CP. 138 (25), g 21), and communicated with all the Unions concerned to ascertain if thev would agree to a reference of the matter to arbitration. The request of the Companies has had the effect of bringing together the N.U.R. and the Craft Unions, who have agreed to act jointly on this question. This joint action is of considerable significance, as hitherto the Craft Unions have always ver)?- definitely refused to be associated in any way with the N.U.R. on matters affecting railway shopmen. The unity is, however, more apparent than real, as the fundamental issue between the N.U.R. and the Craft Unions still remains. Events in connection with the Coal Mining dispute are doubtless responsible to some extent for bringing about the co-operation between the Unions, as the Trade Union movement is anxious that the unity which they consider brought such success in the mining dispute should, in appearance at any rate, be maintained.16. The N.U.R. and the Craft Unions met jointly on the 22nd September to consider their attitude with regard to the request of the Companies. They rejected arbitration, leaving it to the Companies, if they decided to press the matter, to give notice of the proposed reduction to the men concerned. Later in the same day they met the Companies to present their reply. The matter was discussed but no agree-ment was reached, and a further meeting will probably be held.1.7. There is a further complication in connection with railwav shopmen.   It will be remembered (see CP. 138 (25), $ 23) that Award 728 of the Industrial Court is in operation on all the railways, with the exception of the Great Central Section of the London and North-Eastern Railway (and the Cheshire Lines), on which [13606] b 2
Section the shopmen are in receipt of district engineering rates. The N.U.R. have endeavoured from time to time to get the Award applied to the Great Central Section, and in May 1924 requested the Department to set up a Court of Inquiry under Part II of the Industrial Courts Act, to go into the question. This course had just previously been adopted in connection with the application of the Award to the Great Northern Section. At the same time, the N.U.R. threatened that if a Court were not set up at once there would be a stoppage of both shopmen and traffic grades., 18. The Craft Unions: were consulted and indicated strong opposition to the application of the Award to the Great Central. Section, and stated definitely that if a Court of Inquiry were set up they would take no part in its proceedings. The Craft Unions claimed that the membership of the N.U.R. among the shopmen in the works at Gorton and Dukinfield was negligible and that they had no craftsmen at all as members. The Railway Company adopted the attitude that they were prepared to attend and give evidence before a Court of Inquiry if it were set up.19. No decision was reached at that time regarding the appointment of the Court of Inquiry, as the Trade Union Congress General Council decided to take action in regard to the general position of railway shopmen and the relations between the various Unions. The General Council had, however, eventually to admit that they were unable to make any progress towards reconciling the conflicting interests.20. On the 3rd September, 1925, the N.U.R. renewed their request for the appointment of a Court of Inquiry, and stated that, unless Award 728 were applied to the Great Central Section and the Cheshire Lines, there was grave danger of a stoppage of work taking place on and from the 19th September.21. The Railway Company and the Craft Unions are being consulted, but owing to the Annual Assembly of the Trade Union Congress the views of the Unions have been delayed, and the N.U.R. have been informed to this effect. The replies which have so far been received indicate that the Craft Unions are still opposed both to the application of the Award and to the appointment of a Court of Inquiry, and they still contend that the N.U.R. represent only a small minority of the men concerned. It is understood that a further meeting between the Companies and the Unions is to be held on the 12th October to discuss the matter.22. The two questions affecting shopmen, namely, the proposed reduction of 6s. Qd. per week in the bonus and the application of Award 728 to the Great Central Section, are to a certain extent related, as on the Great Central Section the men, being paid district rates, suffered the 6s. Qd. reduction three years ago, and thus have been in receipt of a bonus of 10s, per week, whilst the shopmen, on the lines on which Award &apos;728 has been in operation, have been in receipt of a bonus of 16s. Qd. per week. If the Unions were able to retain and stabilise the 16s. Qd. bonus the opposition of the Craft Unions to the application of the Award, to the Great Central Section might be considerably weakened, in spite of the fact that that opposition is mainly one of principle, namely, to retain district rates. The Craft Unions, however, probably fear that they may not be able to retain the additional 6s. Qd., and therefore the application of the Award to the Great Central Section would mean that the majority of craftsmen would suffer reductions in the base rates and a consequent lost in piece-work earnings.23. It will be seen that the shopmen&apos;s position is one of many difficulties, but the main danger in the railway position lies in the developments affecting the traffic grades. It cannot, however, be ignored that the traffic men&apos;s question and the two matters affecting shopmen may very likely come to a head practically simultaneously.
