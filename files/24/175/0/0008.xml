[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1925.SECEET. CONFIDENTIAL LIBRACP. 408 (25). 30CABINET.SPECIAL  REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No, 119.     August 1925.THE last monthly report on this subject CP. 359 (25) was circulated at the end of July. Since that date I have had under consideration the desirability of continuing the report in its previous form, and I have come to the conclusion that it would be sufficient if the detailed information and figures were in future published quarterly. At the same time I think it may be of interest to issue each month a short statement showing the course of unemployment during the previous month and examining briefly the movements in individual trades indicated by the monthly return of unemployment. The present report accordingly follows this plan.(A.) Numbers of Persons on the Registers of Employment Exchanges inGreat Britain.-	3 923.         1924.		1925.							Aug. 27.	Aug. 25.	July 27.

These increases followed a downward movement which took place throughout July, amounting in all to 106,612, so that the ground then regained has now been entirely lost. This August increase occurred principally among men, although increased registrations of juveniles followed the end of the school [13589]
term. Unemployment among women increased at the beginning of the month, but has since declined regularly week by week. Compared with previous years, the position as a whole shows some deterioration, the corresponding figures for the last week in August of 1924 and 1923 being 1,149,078 and 1,268,828 respectively.(B.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 24th August, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 12&quot;5, as compared with 11*5 for the 27th July, 10&apos;6 for August 1924 and 11&quot;8 for August 1923. The industries principally concerned in the increase in unemployment during the month were: 	Insured	Insured	Industry.	Unemployed at August 24, 1925.	Unemployed at July 27. 1925.

In the Iron and Steel and Shipbuilding Trades the position shows a slight decline during the month. Little change appears to have occurred in the Engineering and Metal Trades, although, generally speaking, the position (except in Marine Engineering) is better than it was a year ago or in 1923. The increase in the Cotton Trade reflects a slight depression, which is not unusual at this time of year, and the figures are affected both by the annual trade holidays and by the closing down of the cotton spinning mills for an additional week in August on the recommendation of the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation. In the Tailoring and Dressmaking Trades increased unemployment is the result of seasonal depression, which has, however, arrived earlier this year than usual, and the increased unemployment in Motor Engineering is also the result of seasonal depression, although its effect has not been felt so severely this year as in previous years. Other Industries whose figures show a fairly marked increase in unemployment during the month are Iron Ore Mining (4- 5&apos;3%), Glass Bottle Making (-f- 5%), Tin Plate Manufacture (4- 2&apos;6%) and the Carpet Trade i+ 2&quot;6%).On the other hand, decreased unemployment is reported in the Jute Industry as a result of the return of the workpeople to employment in Dundee after extended holidays. In the Woollen and Worsted Industry a decrease of over 8,000 follows the settlement of the dispute on the 15th August, but no signs of general improvement in the trade are yet evident. Seasonal causes are responsible for the decreases in unemployment shown in Cocoa, Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery (,-2*6%) and in Musical Instrument Making (-2*6%). The position in the Building Trade continues steady, and is better than at the corresponding dates in 1924 and 1923.(C.) Latest Figures.The latest live register figures published are those for the 14th September, and give the total numbers on the registers as 1,327,637. This is a decrease of 17,818 as compared with the previous week, and 26,665 as compared with the
31st August, but is 163,687 more than a year ago. The distribution of the decrease cannot yet be given by industry, but it appears to have been caused by falls in the registers of 13,000 in the North-Eastern Division, nearly 6,000 in the North-Western Division and over 2,000 in Wales, against which must be set off an increase of some 1,700 in Scotland, together with slight rises in the figures for the Midland and Southern Counties.A. STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,September 23, 1925.
NOTE.In view of the circulation of the First Lord&apos;s paper on airship policy, I now circulate a memorandum that, at the Prime Ministers request, I prepared in May. It will be seen that my memorandum deals with certain proposals made by Commander Burney last March. With the general aspects of the question I have already dealt in my memorandum of the 13th February, 1025 (CP. 84 (25) ). I propose in due course to circulate a further paper on the First Lord&apos;s actual proposals.S. H.Air Ministry,September 24, 1925.(I3S9Z A)
