Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)Copy No.___ j?___25)CABINET. IMPERIAL ECONOMIC COMMITTEE. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.In connection with the proposals for the administration of the  1,000,000 grant for Empire marketing and the possibility of changes in the personnel of the Imperial Economic Committee, I feel bound to call the attention of the Cabinet to the strong feeling on the subject on the part of British agriculturists.I know of nothing which has created more profound resentment among agriculturists than the grant of  1,000,000 to assist the marketing of competitive Dominion produce and the appointment of an Imperial Economic Committee on which the producers at the heart of the Empire have been denied representation.     It is not only that they are affronted by the suggestion that Empire produce does not include the produce of the mother country, but that they see no justification for compensating the Dominion producers for the abandonment of the preference proposals when no similar compensation has been given to the home producers who would also have benefited by these proposals.     The feeling of grievance would of course be greatly intensified if the proposals of the Imperial Economic Committee for the expenditure of large sums of money on advertsing Empire goods are carried out to the exclusion of hosee produce.The Government have agreed in principle that home produce should be brought within the ambit of the  1,000,000 grant, and I would urge that the terms of reference to the Imperial Economic Committee should now be amended accordingly and that representatives
representatives of home producers should be added to the Committee and to any body set up to advise on or administer the expenditure of the grant.I understand that the Secretary of State for the Dominions does not anticipate any opposition from the Dominions to this proposal and so far as the adequacy of the grant is concerned for the rrider scope suggested, it seems probable that there will be considerable difficulty In any case In finding sufficient suitable schemes to absorb  1,000,000- a year,try of Agriculture and Fisheries, 20th November, 1925.
