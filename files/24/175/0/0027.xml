Copy No.    slj  W*C A E I g E T.CP. 427 (2g) .VOLUNTEERING JOR WORK IF THE EVENT OF A GENERAL STRIKE.Memorandum^by the President of the Board ofEducation. -   -In response to the suggestion made by Mr. Seville Chamberlain at the Cabinet Meeting on the 7th, I circulate to my colleagues this Paper on the Volunteer Problem.      I have tried, for the sate of concreteness, to put my views in the form of detailed px-proposals, but I am conscious that my knowledge of the Supply and Transport organisation is not sufficient to enable me to form a final judgment  on points of administration.I. . -The problem of man power during a general strike is twofold:    the problem of retaining in work the men now employed in essential services and the problem of replacing them,  or supplementing them, where necessary,  by volunteers.      Of these,  the first is infinitely the most important,      If we are to induce existing workmen to continue at work when a Strike has been declared, we can only do so by frankly pitting our authority against the authority of those Unions who desire to hold up the country.      If any Union professes a desire to facilitate the maintenance of essential services, our attitude will no doubt be that we shall welcome their assistance, but we must
first make our own arrangements for exerting out own authority.In order to do this without engaging in a general strike-breaking policy,  it seems necessary to schedule in each area the firms whose services will be essential and to give those who work for such firms something like a definite status as servants of the communityTake Motor Transport as an instance. At present, as I understand it, Chairmen of Haulage Committees have been, or are being,  appointed in every Sub-Area,  tut it is not proposed that they should proceed at once to form their Committees out of the chief haulage contractors in their areas, but only that they should quietly approach a few trustworthy heads of firms with a view to making preliminary arrangements.      My suggestion is that they should, do much more than this ;    that they should. actuall3r draw up a list of all the firms which they anticipate will be called upon to maintain food and other essential supplies and that each of these firms should be notified   . accordingly as soon as possible,,      Immediately on the issue of an Emergency Proclamation, these firms should be supplied with a special Royal Proclamation, prepared in advance,  informing their employees that the Firm is working in essential transport services under the direction of the Government and calling upon them to continue at work,      These firms would then post this Proclamation on their premises and,  if desired, their men could be supplied with a special badge denoting their position.      If this policy is adopted, the Government should announce it  in general terms as soon as the preliminary preparations are complete. Similar procedure can be applied to other essential services,,
It will be observed that this procedure, as applied to transport, . involves far more &quot;open activities on the pai t of Chairmen of Haulage Committees than has hitherto,  I under-stand7 been contemplated.    They will not only have to communicate with all the leading transport firms in their areas,  but they may also have to give directions to the local traders as to the firms to which they should apply for haulage in case of need.    There is,  I feel,  some danger in simply trusting to every grocer or baker to find his own haulage in case of emergency by communicating with the nearest Haulage Contractor.    They should indeed be encouraged to make their own arrangements so far as possible, but they should be informed what Contractors they should fall back upon if their own arrangements break down.We must also make provision for the protection of men who remain at work in response to our proclamation.    I am wery much afraid that the response will not be as great as it would  othorwise be If we remain under the self-denying ordinance inssrtod in the Emergency Powers Act to the effect that no regulations should be made in an emergency which vail interfere with the right of peaceful picketing.    I recognise all the objections to Interfering&apos; with that right,  but I think the Cabinet ought to consider whether we should not take powers under the Act of Parliament at least to schedule services vital to the health, food/
supply and safety of the community in an emergency and to make illegal any interference with services so scheduled whether by way of picketing or othorwise. It if is decided to make no change in the law I would suggest that,  in any case,  instructions should be Issued to tho Police, and should be published,  defining, so far as possible, what are the limits of &quot;peaceful persuasion&quot; and directing them to proceed unhesitatingly against any persons guilty of Intimidation.    The time has come when ws must show that the community intends to protect those who serve it.II.The problem of creating a volunteer reserve to replace or supplement the existing man power in essential services is much simpler.    I suggest that we should proceed on the following lines:-fl)    Chairmen of Volunteer Service Committees areresponsible for providing volunteers and they should, therefore, be given discretion,  in consultation with the area headquarters and with those responsible for the various services, to judge whether and in respect of what servioes local conditions render it advisable to enrol volunteers in advance.    They should have full power to issue appeals for enrolment if so desired and the Government should support them in any aotion they may tako in this direction. This again involves, as in the case of the Chairmen of Haulage Committees,  that the Chairmen of Volunteer Service Committees should be brought out into the open.    At present I understand their identity..
will remain unknown to the general public and to the vast majority of transport firms,  etc., until the Emergency Proclamation has actually been issued and there seems to be some doubt whether they would be willing to serve if their names were to be announced beforehand.    This arrangement hardly seems satisfactory and I feel that all those who may need to call upon the Volunteer Service Committees for volunteers to maintain their services should know as soon as possible to whom they should apply.    This, of course,  will also involve the actual constitution of the Committees at an early data.(2)    There is no need to enrol unskilled labour either in advance or even when an emergency actually arises. Calls for such labour wox-dd have to be issued as required by the Volunteer Service Committees by poster, specifying the points such as Docks, 3&apos;ood&quot; Stores,  or the like, &quot;at which volunteers should apply for employ-ment.    It is only necessary in advance to announce that every able bodied man should hold himself ready for such a call at any moment,    Social clubs and associations in each locality can be encouraged to organise their members in preparation for such an eventuality and information can,  of course, be given in advance as to where such calls will be posted in an emergency,  e.g., at the Labour Exchanges,   etc.(3)    Persons employed in skilled trades should be direoted that their first duty is to remain at their posts.    If it becomes necessary to move such men into work more essential than the branch of the trade in which they are now engaged, such movements can best be arranged with the management of the firms for which they are working.
Any person who has experience of a skilled trade and is not now practising that trade cut is prepared to engage as a worker in it, if required, should communicate in writing with his Local Labour Exchange.     This direction can, of course, ba confined to certain essential skilled trades,  at any rate in the first instance.Aa regards Mechanical Transport, in addition to man who may enrol themselves at the Labour Exchange, the Automobile Association and the various other Motor Associations seem to be the obvious bodies to prepare lists of volunteers. They should be asks d to do so and every member of these organisations should be directed to communicate accordingly with his local Branch.      The names of those who have experier. in driving lorries should be especially asked for.      I cannot help thinking that the difficulty of obtaining men with experience of lorry driving would be, to a considerable extent, eliminated by such procedure in view of the very larg number of private chauffeurs who had experience of this kind during the war and in view of -uhe fact that most members of the A.A. are perfectly capable of taking some private lessons in lorry driving 15on their own&quot;.Special Constables.       Here the discretion must naturally rest with the Chief Constable but I submit that the &quot;0.M.B&quot;. &apos; while it may have a place in enrolling various classes of volunteers, is not the appropriate agency for providing Special Constables,      fa shall get a far better class of men if we announce that Chief Constables are ready to receive applications in writing from any persons.who wish to be enrolled than we shall if we leave it to a private organisation.
All these suggestions are based on the assumption that there is now no longer the slightest reason for privacy or secrecy in our preparations and that,  on the contrary, publicity is now a positive advantage if it is conducted by the Government itself,     We are no longer in the position where we were at the beginning of August when we decided that our organisation should go ahead without shunning publicity but without seeking it0      Now public discussion of the measures to be taken in an emergency has become universal and the only question is -whether that publicity should&apos; be left in the hands of the O.M.S. the Press and so forth, or whether it should be taken up and directed by the Government Itself.     The present combination of Government secrecy and public agitation will, if it is continued, lead us into a division of the community into two unregulated camps and it is now necessary that the Government should openly take command.(Intd) E,P0BOARD OF EDUCATION.
