THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.FINANCE BILL, (safeguarding of Industries). Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate a skeleton of a Finance Bill which has been drawn up in informal consultation with the Customs.It will be necessary to have a separate Resolution for each duty.    It may be that In the Bill a separate clause for each duty will be required, but the draughtsmen may think that unnecessary and put all the duties in one clause.   If more duties than those at present approved be decided upon, there would be more duty clauses than the two Indicated in the skeleton.   But the inclusion of all the duties in one clause, instead of having several clauses, would not affect the scope of debate.Of the remaining clauses Nos. 6 to 10 have now become standard clauses of a kind seldom discussed.   Nor should there, apart from the most factious obstruction, be any discussion to speak of on 4 (imperial Preference)? I think that clause should be included,  in accordance with established policy, though in respect of the commodities at present under consideration it is of no importance.If the Worsted Committee h&amp;3   reported in time, and if a worsted duty is included, there would be some scope for discussion under clauses 5 and 8, which could hardly arise with regard to the other duties which have been, or may be sanctioned.SECRET.CABINET.0. P. 447(25).(Intld.) P.C-L.BOARD OF TRADE.27.10.25.
The following is a rough indication of the contents of the Finance Bill:A duty of customs equal to thirty-director and one-third per cent, of the due of the goods shall be charged on the (iportatlon into Great Britain or Northern l-eland of any of the following goods, fiat is to say:oves wholly or partly of leather ir fur/&quot; and leather /or fur/7&quot; therefor jit out ready for sewing, but not includ-Jhg gloves termed in the trade astra-jian gloves and gloves in which leather is led only as trimming or binding.loves of woven or knitted material, folly or partly of cotton, which are t out and sewn up, termed in thefabric gloves, and fabric therefor t out ready for sewing.There shall be charged on the fallow-f.g goods imported into Great Britain &quot;Northern Ireland the following duties customs, that is to say:-s. dnoandescent Gas Mantles.. .the gross 6.*0 apregnated hose or stockings for the manufacture of Gas Mantles...................the lb.The duties imposed by this Act shall charged upon all goods to which they late imported into Great Britain or northern Ireland during a period of ars beginning on the day of192 .The goods to which this Act applies, such Empire products as are entitled preferential rates under Section 8 the Finance Act, 1919, shall be far-ged with customs duties at a Qferential rate of /two-thirds/ of e full rate in all respects as if ese goods and this preferential rate plicable to them were Included in the cond Schedule to the Finance Act, 1919.If it is proved to the satisfaction the Commissioners that duty has been id under this Act in respect of any .0ds, and that the goods have not been H in Great Britain or Northern eland, a. drawback equal to the amount the duty so paid shall be allowed the goods if exported aa merchandise.It is clear that a separate Resolution will be required for each class of articles, having regard to the Chancellor&apos;s statement in the Debate on May 6th last  (0.R.Col.1022). The duties might possibly all be included in one clause in the Finance Bill (as the McKenna duties were in &quot;the last Bill) but little saving of time is likely to result.If the duties are imposed in several clauses, it will be desirable to fix the period by a separate clause, in order to avoid repetition of discussion. This may be less easy,&quot; however, if the duties are imposed for varying periods.Empire preference.Drawback.This clause as drafted follows Section 6(3) of the Finance Act,  1925, relating to lace and embroidery.*   It does not apply to goods worked up in this country and re-exported in a different form.
6.   subject to compliance with such conditions as to security for the re-exportation of the goods as the Commissioners may im-noso, this Actill not apply to goods imported for exportation after transit through Great Britain or Nortnern Ireland or by way of transhipment.17,     Clause applying Seotions 10 and 111 of the Finance Act, 1925.Clause relating to reduced duty pn goods exported and re-imported after undergoing a process abroad -box,ion 6 (2) of the Finance Act, 1925.Where any article chargeable fith a duty under this Act Is also hargeable with other duties of ustomB under another Act the duty Jnder this Act shall not bo charged except in so far as the amounts there-)f exceed the amounts charged under he other Act.1-0. (1)   This Act shall be construed -ogether with the Customs (Consoltda-&apos;ion) Act, 1876, and any enac-cmonts sending that Act, and the expression Commissioners&quot; in this Act means the ommisoioners of Customs and Excise.(2) This Aot may be cited as the finance (No. 2) Act, 1925.Exception for transit goods.This Clause is taken from the Safeguarding of Industries Act (Sect.13).   It was not included in the Finance Act, 1925, but the Customs consider it preferable that specific provision should be made in the present Bill.Section 10 of the previous Act relates to the definition of value for purposes of ad valorem duties, and is necessary.   It was anticipated in the spring that It might afford opportunity for considerable discussion, but in fact it was passed without debate.Section 11 provides that goods which have been re-exported after paying duty nhall not pay again when brought pack.As included in tho previous Aot in respect of lace and embroidery, this clause only applies to goods which have not acquired a different character while abroad, and it is doubtful whether it is likely in this form to be much applicable in practice in connection with any of the articles to which the present Bill may relate.This clause taken from the Finance Act, 1925,  Second Schedule Part III Section (2) and is necessary to meet the case, for example of fabric gloves made partly of silk.Applioation of Customs Acts,Short title.
