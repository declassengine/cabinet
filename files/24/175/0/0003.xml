CONFIDENTIAL LI BRA R[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.].Printed for the Cabinet, September 1925.CONFIDENTIAL^[E 5479/32/65]^ memorandum BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs for THE CABINET.ON Friday, the 4th September, I discussed with the Secretary of State for the Colonies the position arising out of the refusal of the Turkish delegate to respond to his invitation to repeat the assurance given by Fethi Bey at the 30th Session of the Council that the Turkish Government accepted in advance whatever decision might be reached in the matter of the Irak frontier.Mr. Amery was not quite satisfied that the Turkish delegated acquiescence in M. Briand&apos;s final words at the Council when the question was referred to the sub-committee, viz., that &quot; he reminded the parties that they had before the Council placed their cause solemnly in the hands of the League of Nations, of which the Council formed part, and that they were awaiting from the Council that justice which it would endeavour to grant them &quot;altogether settled the doubt. He represented to me the possibility that the sub-committee of three members of the Council might be influenced by the fact that he had repeated Lord Parmoor&apos;s assurance, and that the Turkish representative appeared reluctant to do the same, and might feel that, as there was no difficulty to be anticipated from His Majesty&apos;s Government, it would be easier for them to give a decision in favour of the Turkish claim. He asked me whether I thought it would be tactically desirable to write to the Secretary-General of the League expressing a desire for some further assurance before he entered upon the detailed work of the sub-committee.I replied that while I fully appreciated the force of his argument, I feared that any attempt to draw from the Turkish representative a repetition of the&apos; original assurance would only afford him a loophole for qualifying it, and might not win sympathy from the Council. With this conclusion Mr. Amery entirely agreed. I, however, took the opportunity on the following day in conversation with Senor Guani, the representative of Uruguay, who is one of the sub-committee of three, and with M. d&apos;Avenol, of the League secretariat, to tell them that I had been placed, in a position of some, difficulty and responsibility, as my colleague who was responsible for presenting the British case, and who was not himself as familiar with the League procedure as I was, had expressed to me the apprehension that the Council might be influenced in the manner I have described above, and that he had suggested informing the Secretary-General that, until some further explicit assurance had been given by the Turkish representative, he would find it difficult to proceed with his presentation of the British case. Senor Guani and M. d&apos;Avenol assured me that these apprehensions were without foundation. The assurance given by Fethi Bey at Geneva last year had been so explicit as to leave no possible room for doubt that the Turkish Government, equally with the Blritish Government, were irrevocably committed to accepting in advance whatever decision the Council might arrive at. M. d&apos;Avenol actually put forward the same objection which I had myself suggested to Mr. Amery, namely, that if invited to renew the assurance the Turkish representative would almost certainly attempt to modify it during Mr. Amery&apos;s absence over the week-end, a report was received that the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin had made a public statement to the effect that his Government would not accept any decision imposed upon them by Great Britain or even by the League of Nations, and that if their inviolable rights were infringed by the decision of the Council they would use every means to preserve them, including, if necessary, a recourse to force. A report was also received from Constantinople to the effect that an agitation was being worked, up in the Turkish press and in3060   [13558]
2Turkish military circles with the same object, and a telegram was also received from the High Commissioner for Irak in which he enquired whether there was any truth in the report that the Turkish Government might possibly refuse to accept the decision of the Council.On Mr. Amery&apos;s return to-day I took the opportunity of discussing fully with him and with Lord Cecil the position created by these fresh telegrams.Air-Marshal Sir John Salmond, who was present at the interview, was inclined to press for some step to be taken at this stage to clear up the position, on the ground that, if the negotiations before the sub-committee of the Council were allowed to continue until a decision was arrived at, and the Turkish Government then declined to accept it, military preparations in Irak itself might have to be carried into effect at very short notice.Mr. Amery pointed out that, in fact, there was no probability of any decision on the part of the League which would involve a British advance which might be resisted by the Turks. The most they were likely to. give might be a special commis-sion to rectify the Brussels line, taking our arguments into account, and it would then be a case of a Turkish refusal to allow the commissioners to proceed. Apart from that, it could only be a case of a deliberate attack by Turkey upon territory not only assigned to Irak, but already part of Irak, i.e.s the deliberate provocation of a general war with the British Empire. He considered this so improbable a contingency that he did not regard special military preparations as justified in anticipation of it, nor did he think it should influence our decision as to the line we should take at this stage on the question of a repetition of the Turkish assurance.I said that it appeared to me that only two alternative results might be anticipated from an attempt to extract a further assurance from the Turkish repre-sentative. Either he would merely decline to commit his Government, in which case the negotiations here would have to be broken off, and nothing would, in my opinion, be gained. No further time for military preparations would thus be secured. The second alternative, which appeared to me more likely, was that the Turkish repre-sentative would refrain from committing himself to any definite statement, but would merely start an argument as to the meaning of the words used by Fethi Bey, with the object of receding to some extent from the position taken up by him. In this case the negotiations here would continue, but we should &quot;have lost the advantage which we now possess in the explicit statement made on behalf of the Turkish Government last year.Lord Cecil suggested that Mr. Amery might take an opportunity to explain to representatives of the British and foreign press that His Majesty&apos;s Government were confident, in -view^pf the terms of Fethi Bey&apos;s assurance, that there was no fear whatever of the Turkish Government questioning the League&apos;s decision whatever it might be. We all agreed that this was as far as we should go at the moment, and that, failing some more definite indication on the part of the Turkish Government that they intended to repudiate their own representative, it would not be politic for the British representative here to take any further steps in the matter.September 9, 1925.(Initialled) A.
