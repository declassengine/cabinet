P. 590 (25) j.jSince the date of my last Report I have, in accordance with what I understand to he the wishes of the Cabinet, kept in direct touch, in addition of course to consultation with my Ministerial colleagues, either personally or through Sir John Anderson, with responsible officers from each of the various Departments concerned in the emergency arrange-ments, and I am glad to be able to report that the organisation has been strengthened and developed in every direction.     The decision of the Cabinet in favour of a modicum of publicity, though it could not be out into effect until the Coal Commission had got under way, has already enabled, the Departments to make substantial progress in directions previously barred.     The position is now as follows1.   Emergency Staff at Headquarters of Civil Commissioners&apos; Districts.(a ) Departmental Representatives.Road Commissioners;    Railway, Coal, Shipping and Postal Representativesj    and except as stated in the next paragraph Divisional Food Officers, have been selected by the Departments concerned for the District Headquarters, and &quot;their names have been communicated to the Chief Assistants.As regards the Food Officers, whose duties under the new conditions will entail a considerable burden in normal times, some changes of personnel were to be anticipated.     The existing Officers have, however, undertaken to continue the work except in the case of the North Western, Eastern end
London and Home Counties Divisions,      The vacancy in the first named Division has been filled very satisfactorily by the appointment of Sir Arnold Rushton, shipowner and former Lord Mayor of Liverpool.     The Divisional Officer for London and Home Counties has promised to state by the 5th October whether he can undertake the work,and the filling of the remaining vacancy in the Eastern Division is at present the subject of negotiation.Five Representatives of the Port Labour employers have been appointed.   Arrangements-are bexng made by the Ministry of Transport to appoint representatives at the two remaining important ports0Arrangements, which are almost completed, are being made to develop the co-ordination of the work of the various police forces In each division, and in particular for the appointment of Police Liaison Officers to be attached to the staffs of the several Civil Commissioners to assist them in an advisory capacity and act as links with the several Chief Officers of Police in their Divisions,     These appointments, which are of great importance, are being made after conference with representatives of all the police forces in each division,(b) S ub - 0 hi. e f As g i at ants.Arrangements for securing that every Chief Assistant shall have the services of a whole-time Assistant, as directed by the Cabinet on the 7th August, have been complieted.The Minister of Health has seconded to the post of Assistant General Inspector nine permanent officers who have been recommended to him as suitable to hold these responsible positions,     The officers selected have all had several years&apos; experience of work which has brought them into contact with local administration and have given evidence of a capacity to accept responsibility.
One of the new Assistants is assigned to London, to take the place of an Assistant Inspector who becomes a General Inspector,      The others are assigned to the provincial Divisions in England and Wales, XV ITH the exception of the North Eastern Division.     The General Inspector in that Division has an Assistant, and has been relieved of the charge of a second district for which he&apos;was for a time responsible.In connection with these changes Mr. A.B. Lowry, C.B., Chief General Inspector of the Ministry of Health, has been appointed Chief of Staff to the Civil Commissioners&apos; Department where he will act in association with r.r. Roundell.Mr. Lowry&apos;s place as Chief Assistant In the South Midland Division Is taken by Mr, O.J. LLewellyn.2.    Accommodation at District Headquarters.In accordance with the Cabinet decision that permanent headquarters shouldbe set up in each Civil Commissioner^ District for accommodating Emergency Staff, definite arrange-ments have now been made by the Office of Works to earmark the necessary rooms in existing Government accommodation at each of the nine centres outside London,      The accommodation is ready for    immediate occupation, and instructions have been given for furniture to be made available on demand, for the intending occupants.In addition, tentative arrangements have been made to earmark additional accommodation in the same premises to provide for the expansion of the Emergency Staffs on the actual occurrence of an emergency.      Under this arrangement, regard has been paid to the requirements of the Civil Commissioners, Pood Officers, Mines Department and, in some cases, the Road Commissioner.     These arrangements will be definitely confirmed as soon as the necessary consultations
have taken place with the Departments responsible for the staffs which will have to be removed or concentrated in order to render the soace vacant for Emergency Staff purposes.
