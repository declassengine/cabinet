(This document if the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government),-  &apos; 408cret o a b i f e t. CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,p, 477(25)HOME    AFFAIRS    COMMITTEE. DRAFT POLICE PENSIONS BILL,On consideration toy the Home Affairs Committee   (H.A.C. 18th Cons.   (25)) of the draft Police Pensions Bill and my Memorandum thereon,   (CP. 451(25)) the question was rasiecl whether the object of Clause 2 of the Bill  (relating primarily, to the return of rateable deductions to Police strikers) could not be achieved more simply by merely giving retrospective effect to Section 20 of the Police Pensions Act,   1921,  which governs the return of rateable deductions at the present time;.      This point has been considered but the difficulty is that Section 20 deals with the return of rateable deductions in two classes of cases, namely,   (a) men who resign voluntarily from the Police and (b) men who are dismissed (or retire o-ompulsorily as an alternative to dismissal),  and the object now in view is to apply the provisions of Section 20 of the Act of 1921 in the latter class of case but not in the former.      Before the Act of 1921,  the return of rateable deductions to men who- have re signed was at the option of the Police Authority but by Section 20 of the Aot of 1921,  it was made obligatory.      Generally speaking,   the practice of Local Authorities was to return rateable deductions under their discretionary powers,  but there were,  no doubt, cases where Local Authorities did not avail themselves of these powers;    and the -effect of making Section 20 retrospective would be to compel Police Authorities to re-^open such cases which were disposed of years ago under the then existing powers.      On merits there  is no reason why such oases should be reopened and there would be practical difficulties in many oases in returning the rateable deductions now,  because Police Authorities will probably have lost all touch with many of the men concerned.Under Clause 2 as it stands Police Authorities will be able to consider any oases which are raised by men who resigned and to
17th November,   1925,exerdige a discretion with regard to them:    this seems1 as far as it is necessary to g6, and I am advided that the Clause, though somewhat complicated in form, will work out quite simply in practice *.1 quite recognize the advantage of a simple clause making Section 20 retrospective in effect, hut I am afraid this course is impraoticable for the reason ind.ica.ted above.Wn.J,H.
