CONFIDENT!AL LIBRARY,, -   6[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. IPrinted for the Cabinet,   October 1925. SECRET. ^CP. 443 (25).CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIAGovernment of India (Civil Services) Bill.India Office,My dear Lord Chancellor, 22nd October 1925.I am seriously disturbed to find that in the Report of the Home Affairs Committee&apos;2&apos; the Government of India Civil Services Bill, which has passed the House of Lords and awaits second reading in the House of Commons, has been classified in List A 2, and not in List A I of essential Bills which must be proceeded with.I rather reproach myself for not having personally made plain to the Home Affairs Committee that it is essential that this Bill should be passed in the forthcoming session. I was, however, under the hnpression that the urgent character of the Bill was well understood. Lord Winterton explained to the Committee in the summer the reasons why it was imperative that the Bill should he passed at an early date, and, when the second reading in the Commons was held over before the recess, he obtained a verbal promise from the Whips that it should be taken at the first opportunity in the autumn session.I am aware ol the extreme pressure of parliamentary business, but there has already been undue delay over this Bill and it is vital that it should be passed this session.The main object of the Bill is to&apos;put beyond doubt the Secretary of State&apos;s power to protect the emoluments of the services in India from adverse votes in the Indian Legislatures. In asking the Universities to help us to get the badly wanted recruits for the Indian Civil Service, we have repeatedly assured them in the past year of the reality -of the Secretary of State&apos;s power in this respect, and with their help we have obtained at the last examination enough British recruits to warrant us in thinking that the corner has been turned. But, if the Bill is not passed this session, it will he in the power of the Indian Legislatures to reject in the spring grants for some of the concessions recently given the services on the recommendation of the Lee Commission. If they did, the services and the Universities would have good ground for complaint. We should be accused of breach of faith, and it is quite certain that all the good we have done by propaganda at the Universities would be lost. We should, indeed, be in a worse position than ever ; for it would be quite hopeless ,to try to restore, a second time, the confidence of the Universities in the will and the power of His Majesty&apos;s Government to protect the men who are essential to India if we are to discharge our responsibilities.If all other expedients fail for securing time for the Bill, Lord Winterton considers that he could get it through if given two or three evenings after II o&apos;clock, as there is not likely to be any real opposition to it.I may mention that I should harve no objection to the Indian Divorce Bill, which the Committee have also included in category A 2, being transferred to List C. 1 should be satisfied if this Bill is introduced in the House of Lords during this session.I am circulating a copy of this letter to the Cabinet, as the Report of the Home Affairs Committee will come up at to-morrow&apos;s meeting for confirmation.Yours sincerely,The Rt. Hon. the Lord Chancellor. BIRKENHEAD.* H.A.C. 17th Conclusions (25).755       100    10.25
