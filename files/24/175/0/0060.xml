G.P. 460(25).C A B I N E Ti-HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE *1 $REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE  (ECONOMY PROVISIONS)  BILL. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.An earlier draft of this Bill  (which makes provision for an annual register and other matters conducive to economy) was considered on the 29th June by the Home Affairs Committee who then recommended that the Bill in a simplified form should be introduced in the Autumn.    The Cabinet at a meeting on the 28th October decided that legislation should proceed as soon as Parliament reassembles.The provisions as to the annual register have been shortened.    Several of the other provisions included in the former draft have been omitted, but clauses 2 and 3 are retained by the desire of the Treasury.V7, J. H,Sth November,   1925.
APPENDIX.Notes on Clauses.Clause 1.    Annual Register!.    The register corresponds to thepresent Autumn register,  and comes into force on 15th October, but in order to give longer time for printing and compilation the qualifying period ends on 1st June instead of 15th June. This additional 14 days,   is allotted to the canvassing and electors lists stages,  but some rearrangement of the dates at later stages may be found necessary.    In consequence of the reduced qualifying period,  Schedule one amends Section 7 of the Act of 1918, which preserves qualifications where a house is let furnished for not more than 4 months in the whole during the qualifying period.    It reduces the letting perioa to 2 months, but if there has been occupation for 6 months, preserves the existing right to &quot;let for 4 months.    The Act of 1921 as to the residence of persons on service is also amended.Contracts entered into for the preparation of the Spring register,  1926,  are annulled following the Elections and Registration Act,  1915, which postponed elections and registration during the war.    Payment will, however, be made for work actually done on that register,  and also any payments which the Treasury consider necessary to prevent undue hardship to persons engaged to assist the registration officer.Clause 2.    Issues of Ballot Papers.    This clause recognises asystem actually adopted in some Northern towns, under which the register at a polling station is divided to enable several issues of ballot papers to be made simultaneously.    In such cases a larger number of electors can be allotted to each polling station and fewer Presiding Officers are required.2ii]LB JLJ3.    Claims against Returning Officers.    The Act of  1918 repealed the former requirement that claims against Returning
Offioers for work,  etc., done should be sent in within 14 days after the return of the election.    The clause revives the requirement. Clause 4.    The Bill is not to apply to northern Ireland where the system of one register a year already obtains for elections both to the Imperial Parliament and the Northern Ireland Parliament.
