They thought it only right to emphasise, however, that in their opinion any precaxitionary measures which could be suggested would almost certainly prove futile if the public was in no way prepared for their reception.     There were some signs that the public were gradually realising the significance of air attack,, His Committee did not advocate that any considerable steps should be taken at once with the object of creating a wider knowledge of attack from tho air and its unavoidable consequences, but rather that the process of education in this respect should be slow and gradual so as to eliminate as far as possible the chance of creating undue alarm&quot;.4*     As regards the possible removal of the Capital incertain eventualities, the only dec!sion required is asto whether preparation for such a contingency should be proceeded with by the Committee on Air Raids Precautions,(Signed)  M.P.A.

That the Home Office should be requested to nominate a representative to act as Chairman of the Sub-Committee.(c.) That the Sub-Committee should be instructed to render an Annual Report of the progress made with regard to air raid precautions for consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence?2. Owing to the change in Government, which occurred before the Sub-Committee had been actually brought into being, the question was again considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 180th Meeting held on the 4th February, 1924, when it was agreed-(a.)

REPORT.PART 1.THE EXTENT OF THE MENACE.1. AT the very commencement of our investigations we found ourselves confronted with the difficulty of determining the extent of the menace against which we were required to provide. So alarming was the estimate framed by the Air Staff of the probable danger to which this country would be exposed, that we felt that any precautions which we could possibly recommend would be bound to prove inadequate in the event of air attack on a large scale, and would necessitate at the same time a large expenditure of public money. It occurred to us, therefore, that possibly the most efficient precaution which could be taken in the circumstances was the provision of increased forces for purely defensive purposes.2. Though the submission of any such recommendation would not fall strictly within the scope of our terms of reference, we considered; nevertheless, that it would be our duty to represent that the provision of larger forces for defensive purposes might not involve any appreciable increase of expenditure, provided that thereby the scale of precautions for the protection of the civil population could be considerably reduced.3. Before putting forward any such recommendation, however, we thought it advisable to consult the Chief of the Air Staff, and we accordingly requested Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard, Bart., COB., D.S.O., to give us his views on this aspect of the problem.4. Sir Hugh Trenchard was so emphatically of the opinion that an increase of the defence forces beyond a certain proportion would not secure greater immunity from -attack, that we felt we had no alternative but to continue our investigations with a view to mitigating, so far as possible, the evils attendant upon aerial bombardment.5. We have referred to this matter at some length, not because we entertain any doubt on the soundness of the views expressed by the Air Staff, but because we think it only right to emphasise the very serious nature of the menace to wdiich this country is exposed, and because we wish to guard against creating an impression of false security in putting forward our recommendations.6. In order to realise how serious this menace is, it will suffice to quote the following figures : It is estimated that our nearest neighbour could drop on this country 200 tons of bombs in the first twenty-four hours of the war, 150 tons in the second twenty-four hours, and 100 tons every subsequent twenty-four hours for an indefinite period. In comparison with this estimate we are told that the total weight of bombs dropped on this country during the whole of the late war amounted only to 300 tons, and that the maximum in any one period of twenty-four hours did net exceed 5 tons.7. The basis on which this scale of attack is computed is set out in detail in a memorandum submitted to us by the Air Staff (attached as Appendix (A)), which shows that the nature of the attack may be divided into two main classes, viz. : (i.) Bombardment, (ii.) Gas.8. Bombardment may be effected with three kinds of bombs, either (i.) High explosive with thin case for demolition effect ; or (ii.) High explosive-with thick case for fragmentation effect ; or (hi.) Incendiary, which scatter small fires over a large area.Gas may be discharged in bombs or sprayed in the form of rain from suitable containers. The whole subject is exhaustively dealt with in a report by the Chemical Warfare Committee (OLD. Paper No. 134-A), which we commend to the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence.9. It will not, however, be possible to ascertain beforehand what particular form, or combination of forms, of attack is about to be delivered. Any precautions which may be adopted, therefore, will need to be contrived so as to meet any and every one f these possible contingencies. - ;.&apos;      :
* The scientific aspects of this problem are being examined by the Anti-Aircraft Research Committee.10. A point to which, we think particular attention should be directed is the danger to which London is exposed. We have been informed that the Metropolis will certainly be the enemy&apos;s main objective and that, with the means of defence at present available, it will not be possible to secure immunity for our Capital. In fact the Air Staff considers it advisable to proceed on the assumption that the weight of bombs dropped on London will not be reduced below 50 tons per twenty-four hours for the first month of hostilities.11. We, therefore, instituted enquiries with the object of ascertaining whether it was possible^ (k) For the vital activities normally centred in and around London to be removedto a less exposed part of the country, and (ii.) For the life of the nation to be maintained if the activities normally centred in and around London, were stopped altogether or seriously curtailed.The answer to both of these questions we found to be a decided negative.12. The situation, therefore, in regard to London is crucial, and we think that no effort should be spared and no avenue left unexplored which may possibly lead to a condition of greater security.13. For this reason we have directed our attention mainly to the particular case of London. Any measures which we recommend in regard to London can, however, be applied to less important centres with such minor modifications as are necessary to meet local conditions ; we feel, therefore, that if the needs of London can be met, the provision thus made will cover the needs of the remainder of the country.14. A further point which, in our opinion, requires emphasis is the possible moral effect of aerial bombardment. We deal with this aspect of the problem later in our report, and will only quote here an extract from the Air Staff memorandum in this connection &quot; It is well known that the moral effect of Air Attack is out of all proportion greater than the material results achieved.&quot; While, therefore, serious material damage may be expected from bomb attack, the most probable cause of chaos in the community will be the moral collapse of the personnel employed in the working of the vital public services, such as transport, lighting, water and food distribution.&quot;15. Having regard to these factors, we think it advisable, before proceeding to enumerate those recommendations which fall more properly within our terms of reference, to place on record that, in our opinion, the most effective reply to an attack from the air is the provision of a strong attacking force wherewith to carry the war into the enemy&apos;s country.16. Lastly, we have considered whether the &quot; Rules of Aerial Warfare,&quot; as drafted by the Commission of Jurists which sat at The Hague from December 11)22 to February 1923, constitute any measure of security for the civilian population from aircraft attacks. Apart altogether from the measure of reliance which can be reposed in international agreements, the actual objectives, the bombardment of which is recognised as legitimate in these rules, will normally be located in such close proximity to centres of population that the effect on the civilian, community is bound to be considerable, even if the greatest care and discrimination is exercised by the enemy in. the choice of targets. We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that these rules do not offer any appreciable degree of protection..17. We think that the extent of the menace to which this country, especially London, is exposed, and the difficulties of combating this menace, are not generally appreciated. Unless some means, at present quite unforeseen, can be devised for preventing aircraft from reaching their objective,&quot;5&quot; serious damage to life and property, with its attendant moral effects, must be accepted as inevitable. The measures which we proceed now to enumerate must only therefore be regarded as palliatives.18. It is on this warning note that we submit the following recommendations : 
part II.EDUCATION   OF PUBLIC   OPINION  TO  A  REALISATION  OFTHE  MENACE.19. We have been deeply impressed by the considered opinion of the Air Staff, that in aerial warfare it is not possible to ensure immunity from attack for any locality within range of the bases from which hostile aircraft can operate, and also by the fact that, unlike other forms of war, air attack can be delivered in its greatest intensity on the first day of hostilities.20. The position of our capital in this regard becomes, therefore, a matter of the gravest concern.21. As already stated, we do not think the population of this country realises the extent of the danger to which they may be exposed, and we fear that, since opportunity will not occur, once war has been declared, for them gradually to familiarise themselves with the new conditions, there is a serious danger of panic on a large scale.22. We, therefore, recommend that a Royal Proclamation should be prepared for issue immediately on the outbreak of hostilities with any Power within striking distance of this country by air. This Proclamation should, we think, outline the conditions which are likely to be encountered ; emphasise the measure of relief which may be anticipated from a vigorous counter-offensive against the enemy ; lay stress on the absolute necessity of maintaining the country&apos;s vital activities ; and call on the people loyally to obey any orders and instructions which may from time to time be found necessary and to exhibit their national qualities of courage and endurance when exposed to danger and subjected to hardships.23. We feel, however, that something more is required if the chances of demoralisa-tion on the part of the public are to be appreciably minimised. The effect of a Proclamation such as we have suggested may be the reverse of what is desired if the ground has not to some extent been prepared for its reception.24. We think that the consultations with outside authorities in connection with schemes for Air Paids Precautions which are being conducted by the various Depart-ments, as approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence at the 194th Meeting, will engender an interest in the subject and create among a small number of discreet persons a realisation of the full significance of air attack. This process will, however, need to be expanded.25. We are of opinion that, in order to obviate all risk of creating undue alarm, the education of the public on this subject should be slow, gradual and deliberate,, and might be effected, inter alia, in the following ways.26. In addition to the enquiries mentioned above, an appreciation of the conditions likely to be encountered will gradually spread through the medium of the measures suggested&apos; later in this Report to organise various bodies to meet the needs of the situation. For example, the role of the police will need to be considerably augmented, and a certain measure of training will have to be undertaken in peace time ; the various Fire Brigade and Ambulance Services will have to be co-ordinated. Some tuition in anti-gas measures will need to be imparted to those required to work in &quot; gassed &quot; areas.27. In this way some idea of the possible consequences of air attack is bound to grow, and the process will have the added advantage that, at the same time as a realisation spreads of the existence of a menace, there will also spread the information that steps are being taken to combat it, which should greatly minimise the chances of alarm and possible panic.28. The services of the Press, too, might be enlisted and prove of very valuable assistance, care being, of course, exercised to obviate the risk of creating a scare.29. We have confined ourselves to enumerating some of the more obvious ways in which the education of the public may be achieved and have deliberately refrained from making any specific recommendations,.for we feel that Ministers themselves will desire to choose the moment and general means to be adopted for bringing about this educative process.30. We have laid emphasis on this aspect of the problem for it has been borne m upon us that in the next war it may well be that that nation, whose people can endure aerial bombardment the longer and with the greater stoicism, will ultimately prove victorious.
PART III. THE WARNING SYSTEM. (I.) Its Natube.32. We have been advised that one of the outstanding features of air attack in the next war will be its continuity. The question then immediately arises whether in these circumstances a general warning system would prove practicable or serve any useful purpose.33. It has been suggested, to us further that since it would be the enemy&apos;s aim to cause as widespread an interruption as possible to our normal activities, we would, by the application of a general warning system, only be assisting him in attaining his object.34. On the other hand, we have been informed that instances occurred in the last war when operatives refused to attend at factories, unless given a definite assurance that they would receive adequate warning of the approach of hostile aircraft.35. It must be assumed, moreover, that in addition to the attacks on the Metropolis, which may be expected to be more or less continuous at the outbreak of war, the enemy will also launch attacks intermittently against other important centres or particular vulnerable points. At all events, this contingency must be provided for, and it is obviously important that in case of any threatened attack those responsible for certain public services, such as the Police, Fire Brigade, &amp;o, should, if possible, have previous warning.36. As it is not possible to foretell the conditions which will obtain in the future, we consider that there should be a fully worked out system of warning, which can be put into operation or not, generally or in particular localities, and wholly or partially, as circumstances dictate, when the emergency arises.37. The warning system which we contemplate would be founded on the scheme of observation and intelligence required for. the guidance of the fighting forces. A brief description is attached (Schedule I) from which it will be seen that the system consists of two distinct parts : (a) the collection of information regarding the enemy&apos;s activities ; (b) the distribution of the prearranged warnings to the areas threatened.38. The first is a common service both to the authorities responsible for anti-aircraft defence and those responsible for the protection of the civil population. The second is primarily the concern of the civil authorities, who should be made responsible for the method and extent of the distribution of warnings. The system as a whole should, therefore, be worked out by the service authorities and the civil authorities in consultation, but when in operation the decision as to the moment at which any particular district is to receive the prearranged signals notifying the approach of hostile aircraft must rest with the service authorities, acting on such general principles as may have been laid down.39. The collection of information is dependent on the organisation of a system of observation posts, a system which, as the experience of the last war goes to prove, can be most efficiently worked through the police. We recommend, therefore, tha the police organisation should be used again for this purpose and that an Observatior Corps, consisting of volunteers enrolled as special constables, should be formed and trained in these specific duties.40. With a view to ascertaining how this proposal would work out when put into practice, a trial was made on a small scale in August-September. of last year. The results were found to he quite.satisfactory. In order, however, to make sure that no insuperable difficulties are likely to arise in working the scheme on a scale commensurate with the needs of actual warfare, we understand that a further trial on a more extended plan is being carried out this summer, and that arrangements have already been made whereby a network of observation posts, consisting of four to six31. Summary of Recommendations.(i.) That the education of the public to a realisation of the full significance of aerial attack is a matter of vital importance. (Paragraphs 19-30.) (ii.) That a Proclamation should be prepared for issue immediately on the outbreak of hostilities warning the public of the conditions likely to be encountered and exhorting them to meet these conditions with courage and endurance    (Paragraph 22.)
special constables each, has been established to cover the whole area of Kent and Sussex.41. It is hoped that by means of this observation system the exact whereabouts over this country of any hostile craft will always be known, and that consequently the areas, in which definite precautionary and defensive measures will have tc be taken, will be restricted both in size and number.42. As already stated, we consider that the conditions under which the warning system should be put into operation can only be determined when the character and extent of the menace can be accurately gauged. It is not possible to formulate definite rules on the matter many years in advance.43. Though, once hostilities have commenced, enemy aircraft will in all probability be over our country almost continuously, yet it seems likely that consider-able periods will intervene between massed attacks in strong formations. It is against the latter that concerted measures must primarily be directed. We have, therefore, divided aerial attacks into two main classes, and have adopted for our purpose classification similar to that employed in 1903 by Mr. Balfour in respect of invasions, viz. : (i.) Those which are planned and carried out on such a scale as would be capable of causing considerable damage and destruction and, therefore, constitute a serious menace.(ii.). Those which are contrived on a less ambitious scale and are intended to distract and alarm rather than to achieve any great material result.To the first it may be convenient to apply the term &quot; Mass Attack&quot;; to the second the term &quot; raid.&quot;44. The exact strength of formation which will constitute a &quot; raid&quot; or a &quot; mass attack &quot; will vary with the progress of developments in aircraft and anti-aircraft armaments, and a decision on this point is not one which we, as a Committee, are competent to take. We are of opinion, however, that it is essential that a clear line of demarcation between the two should be laid down in advance, for to attempt to define each and every incursion across our coasts on its merits would only lead to confusion. We recommend, therefore, that the Air Staff be constituted the competent authority on this matter, and that an appropriate entry be made in the Air Ministry Chapter of the War Book, which will ensure that a decision is reached after any necessary consultation with civilian authorities during the &quot; precautionary stage &quot; and prior to the actual outbreak of hostilities.45. On the assumption that the above suggestion is adopted we recommend that the following principles should serve as a guide when the application of the warning system is under consideration :  (i.) That &quot;raids&quot; should be disregarded for all purposes of a warning to civilian organisations.(ii.) That &quot; mass attacks &quot; should be considered proper occasions for the issue of warnings.46. In order to enable measures to be put into operation which become effective only after an appreciable lapse of time, and also to reduce as far as possible the period of interruption to normal activities, we consider that the system should provide for two distinct categories of warning, viz. : (i.) A preliminary warning.(ii.) A warning fifteen or twenty minutes later when the attack is imminent.The former would be issued only to those required to put anti-aircraft measures into operation, while the latter would be of more general application. (See paragraphs 49-54 below).47. Whether the issue of a &quot; general alarm &quot; would be justified on receipt of the warnings referred to above is a question which will vary according to the locality and vulnerability of each separate town or district, and we recommend, therefore, that a decision on this point should be left to local authorities, who should be advised, however, that it is the national policy that normal activities should, be interfered with as little as possible, and that the issue of a general alarm is to be deprecated, unless Clearly demanded by the conditions prevailing in any particular town or district. So far as London is concerned there are no local authorities to whom a decision of this nature can he referred. It will be necessary, therefore, for the Government to determine whether a &quot; general alarm&quot; is required at the outset of hostilities. In any case, we consider that the necessary apparatus should be held in readiness for this purpose.
48. Summary of Recommendations.(i.) That there should be a fully worked out system of warning which can be put into operation or not as circumstances dictate when the emergency arises, and that, the details of this system should be worked out by the Home Office in consultation with the Air Ministry, the War Office and the General Post Office. (Paragraph 36.) (ii.) That the services of the police should be utilised in the organisation of the warning system, and that special constables to be trained as observers should be enrolled in an observation corps for this purpose.   (Paragraph 39.)(iii.) That aerial attack should be divided into two classes &quot; Mass Attacks &quot; and &quot;raids&quot;&apos; and that the Air Staff should be constituted the competent authority to decide on the definition of each. This decision to be promulgated before the actual outbreak of hostilities. An appropriate note to be entered in the Air Ministry Chapter of the War Book to this effect.   (Paragraphs 43 and 44.)(iv.) That &quot;Mass Attacks&quot; should be considered proper occasions for the issue of warnings, and &quot; raids&quot; should be disregarded for all purposes of a warning to civil organisations.   (Paragraph 45.)(v.) That the issue of a &quot;general alarm&quot; should be deprecated, but left to the discretion of local authorities.   (Paragraph 47.)(vi.) That it is for the Government to determine whether a &quot; general alarm &quot; should be issued in London at the outset of hostilities, and that an appropriate entry to this effect should be made in the Home Office Chapter of the War Book.   (Paragraph 47.)(vii.) That the necessary apparatus for the sounding of an alarm should be held in readiness by those organisations responsible for its actual issue.   (Paragraph 47.)(II.) Its Application.49. Mention has been made in paragraph 46 above of two different classes of warning, viz. : (i.) A preliminary warning, and(ii.) A warning fifteen or twenty minutes later -when the attack is imminent.50. We consider that the former should be confined to such authorities and organisations as cannot take the action which will be required of them on the second warning unless they have had some preliminary notice to enable them to make the necessary preparations. We include generally under this heading such public safety-organisations as police, fire brigades, salvage and ambulance corps, and such industrial undertakings as explosive factories, blast furnaces and collieries with by-product plant.51. The second warning, in our opinion, may be more widely distributed, and the lists of persons to receive it may include other public and industrial undertakings and institutions which, though not required to put anti-aircraft measures into operation, can nevertheless materially profit by the receipt of a warning.52. In this connection we would draw attention to our previous recommendation that the issue of a general alarm should be deprecated, and also to the fact that the distribution of warnings is entirely dependent on the Public Telephone service. Should, therefore, the number of recipients of warnings become unduly enlarged, there will be danger of congestion on the telephone lines, and a possible complete breakdown of the whole warning system. For this reason we consider that the number of recipients should be strictly limited to those to whom the warnings will be of real use, and we recommend that the Home Office should be charged with the compilation of lists of persons to whom the warnings of each kind would normally be distributed, and that these lists should be maintained up to date by being brought under review from time to time.53. We have, of course, excluded from our enquiries all military organisations, which are required to take part in opposing the enemy&apos;s advance, as being beyond the scope of our terms of reference. But we have been advised that there will be at all times in this country a certain number of Naval, Army and Air Force units and depots which will not be actively engaged against the enemy. We recommend, therefore, that these units generally should be required to comply with the measures proposed for the remainder of the community. But having regard to the fact that [13297]    &apos; - c
a disciplined force might well be able to profit from a warning which, if issued to a heterogeneous crowd, such as a theatre audience, might only lead to &quot; confusion worse confounded,&quot; we recommend that discretionary latitude should be left to Military Commanders in the matter, on the understanding that, except in very special cases, priority on Post Office telephone lines cannot be accorded for the distribution of warnings to subordinate formations.54. We attach in Schedule II a list of the various categories of authorities and organisations which we consider should be included in the warning lists. It does not necessarily follow that all the various authorities and organisations of these descriptions throughout the United Kingdom will be warned on the approach of hostile aircraft, but only those situated in threatened areas. The boundaries of the various areas are determined by the ramifications of the Post Office telephone system, the details of which will be worked out in consultation with the Home Office, Air Minister and War Office, as stated in paragraph 48 (i) above.55. Summary of Recommendations.(i.) That the preliminary warning should be issued to such authorities and organisations as require time to put their anti-aircraft measures into . operation-i.e., public safety organisations (such as Police, Fire Brigades, Salvage and Ambulance Corps), and industrial undertakings (such as explosive factories, blast furnaces, &amp;c). (Paragraph 50.)(ii.) That the second warning should be issued to public and industrial undertakings and public institutions, which can materially profit by the receipt of a warning.    (Paragraph 51) (iii.) That the number of recipients of both these warnings should be aslimited as circumstances permit.   (Paragraph 52.) (iv.) That the Home Office should be charged with the compilation of lists under both headings, which lists should be brought under review and amended periodically.    (Paragraph 52.)(v.) That military units, other than those actively engaged against the enemy, should comply with the measures adopted for the remainder of the community, but that discretionary latitude should be left to Commanders in this respect, on the understanding that priority for the distribution of warnings to subordinate formations cannot be - accorded On Post Office telephone lines except in very special cases. (Paragraph 53.)PART IV.THE PREVENTION OF DAMAGE.(I.) By Increasing the Difficulties of the Attackers.(A.) Lighting Restrictions.56. In pursuing our enquiries in this direction we have been somewhat baffled by the divergent views which have been expressed at various times on the efficacy of the lighting restrictions which were adopted during the last war. For example in regard to London-in some of the reports it is clearly stated that the bridges over the River Thames could not be mistaken, while in others it is asserted that their recognition was impossible. .57.-It is questionable, however, whether enemy pilots would endeavour to secure a high standard of accuracy in the sighting of their bombs. They might quite likely content themselves merely with the bombardment of the capital.58. To mask the mass of London does not appear to be a feasible operation.59. Before, therefore, we feel competent to recommend any particular measures for restricting lighting, we consider that experiments should be carried out with the object of ascertaining: (i) whether any substantial measure of protection can be accorded to London and provincial towns by this means ; and, if so (ii) what are the best methods of providing such protection. A preliminary series of experiments has already been put on foot at our suggestion to test the possibility of disguising the distinctive form of the Oval and this we think might with advantage be followed by attempts to obscure the course of the river.60. On  the  assumption  that   these   experiments  establish  the fact that an
&amp; 6 llappreciable measure of protection can be secured by means of lighting restrictions, we recommend that the following principles should govern their adoption : (i.) The issue of regulations in regard to lighting should be vested in one centralauthority-the Home Office ; and (ii.) The Fighting Services should be required to conform with these regulations in respect of property under their control, but should have authority togrant exemption where special circumstances   render   such  exemptionnecessary.61. The Admiralty is the Department responsible for any modification or suppression of the system of navigational, lights. We suggest that that Department in considering the question of such alteration in connection, for example, with the possible diversion of shipping should confer with the Air Ministry as to the bearing of their action on Air Raid precautions.62. We have also made enquiries as regards lights on board fishing-vessels, and have been informed that these are not likely to exist in any area which would be of material assistance to a potential enemy. We therefore consider that they can be ignored for purposes of restriction or extinction of lights.63. It has occurred to us that, in framing regulations for lighting restrictions, considerable simplicity would result if these regulations covered all purposes for which an&apos; extinction or diminution of lighting was required. At the risk, therefore, of exceeding our terms of reference, we venture to recommend that any regulations with regard to lights of a private or municipal character which are considered necessary from a purely naval or military point of view should be embodied with those issued by the Home Office for anti-aircraft purposes.64. Summary of Recommendations.(i.) That the best method of restricting lighting for anti-aircraft purposes-should be determined by means of practical experiments. (Para-graph 59.)(ii.) That the issue of regulations in regard to lighting should be vested in one central authority-the Home Office.    (Paragraph 60.;(iii.) That the Fighting Services should be required to conform with these regulations in respect of property under their control, but should have authority to grant exemption where special circumstances render such exemption necessary.   (Paragraph 60.)(iv.) That the Admiralty, in consultation with the Air Ministry, should be requested to consider the question of the suppression or modification of navigational lights for anti-aircraft purposes.   (Paragraph 61.)(v.) That &quot; Fishing&quot; lights are unlikely to afford any material assistance to a potential enemy and can therefore be ignored.   (Paragraph 62.)(vi.) That for. the sake of simplicity regulations in regard to restrictions of lighting to meet naval or military requirements should be embodied in the regulations drawn up by the Home Office for anti-aircraft purposes.   (Paragraph 63.)(B.) Concealment.05. We have made enquiries as to whether there is in existence at the present time any efficient means of concealing important centres from the view of hostile airmen. We have been informed that the progress made up to date in respect of smoke screens does not afford effective cover from view from the air and that the process of generation is at the same time very expensive. We do not believe that it will be possible to mask the mass uf London, but hope that some means may be found whereby protection may be provided for restricted areas of real importance. We have had a report on experiments already undertaken at Porton, aud we understand that the matter is being followed up. We therefore take this opportunity to-emphasise the vital necessity of ensuring that no means are ignored which may possibly lead to the discovery of some adequate measure of protection or concealment.(II.) By Providing Protection.66. This particular aspect of the problem has engaged our attention at several meetings.   It includes not only the question of the provision of shelters, but also the very much wider subject of the protection of public and other buildings of national importance. [13297] 02
67. Having regard to the nature and size of the bombs likely to be employed against us, it appears that, except where special construction with this object in view is adopted, no modern building will be able to resist the forces developed in the event of a direct hit, though adequate protection should be possible against damage or injury from fragments or near misses.68. Before the engineers are able to state what measures are necessary to secure immunity for buildings of Various &quot;kinds, certain information is required in regard to the forces developed on detonation of bombs weighing 500 lbs. and upwards, which information apparently does not exist at the present time and can only be obtained by means of direct experiment.69. We have therefore requested the War Office to undertake experiments for this purpose, and we have suggested that their nature and extent should be determined in consultation with the appropriate depaitnients of the Air Ministry and Office of Works.70. When the necessar3r data are secured, we recommend that the Office of Works should be requested to prepare, for the consideration of the Government, plans for the provision of public shelters and for the protection of those buildings, the importance and construction of which warrant the expenditure which will necessarily be involved.71. In devising methods for protection against bombs containing high explosive, sight must not, however, be lost of the possible employment of gas. shelters, to be efficient, must provide protection against both these kinds of attack. We recommend, therefore, that the Chemical Warfare Committee should be taken into consultation in the drafting of any plans.72. Summary of Recommendations. (i.) That the War Office, in consultation with the Air Ministry and Office of Works, should conduct experiments with the object of ascer-taining the forces developed on detonation of bombs weighing 500 lbs. and upwards, and their effects on buildings of various kinds. (Paragraphs 68 and 69.) (ii.) That the Office of Works should, on the information thus obtained, prepare, for the consideration of the Government, plans for (a.) The provision of public shelters;(b.) The protection of public and other buildings of national importance ;having regard to the possible use of &quot;gas,&quot; for the consideration of which the Chemical Warfare Committee should be taken into consultation.   (Paragraphs 70 and 71.)(III.) By Evasion.73. Since London will be the main objective of the attacking forces, it becomes of great importance to estimate (a.) The contribution of the Metropolis towards those activities of the nation whichare vital in time of war, and (b.) The extent to which such activities could, if necessary, be transferred to other areas in emergency.74. We have not found it easy to obtain exact data, but from information supplied to us by the Board of Trade we conclude that London may be taken as representing approximately one-third of the belligerent strength of the nation, and that, if London were to become untenable, only a relatively small part of its activities could be moved elsewhere.75. It follows that, in order to enable this country to continue the struggle effectively, every effort must be made to maintain the capitals vital activities. Whole-sale evacuation of the Metropolis, as a measure of policy, is thus out of the question.76. Further, it is clear from the report of the &quot;London Committee&quot; on the &quot; Supply of London in the event of the Port of London being wholly or partially closed&quot; that it will be impossible to feed a large mass of population on the move. This report states : &quot; With a population out of hand and on the move, the ordinary machinery of distribution would disappear and there would be no material out of which other machinery could be fashioned even if there were time to make it. From the point of view of food alone it is essential that an exodus, should be prevented at all costs.&quot; . . .,   (C.I.D. Paper No&apos;. 132-A, paragraph 28.)
77. Both expediency and necessity seem, therefore, to demand that the. people of London shordd remain at their posts.78; We believe, however, that the public would not tolerate drastic regulations forbidding all movement, and that any attempt to enforce such regulations would inevitably lead to complete loss of control and widespread panic.79. We consider, therefore, that while all those who are in any way concerned with maintaining London&apos;s vital activities should be encouraged and, as far as possible, required to remain at work, arrangements should be made to evacuate &quot; les bouches inutiles &quot; immediately on the outbreak of hostilities.80. Many of those thus leaving London will have homes to go to and will possess their own means of conveyance. There will, however, be large numbers who are not so fortunately placed, and a refugee problem on quite a considerable scale will there-fore inevitably arise, and should be provided against in advance.81. The three main factors in this problem are transport, accommodation and food supply.82. From consultations which we have held with the General Managers of the four main railway groups, we have been led to believe that the transport aspect of this problem presents no insurmountable difficulties, and, though more prolonged, should not exceed in dimensions the normal experience of an August Bank holiday.83. The question of accommodation is, however, of quite a different category. The well-to-do will probably have little difficulty in obtaining suitable shelter, but the poorer sections of the community will require special provision which, we think, ought to be worked out in advance in considerable detail, so that the difficulties of the situation may not be aggravated by the creation of class bitterness.84. The supply of food and other necessities is dependent on the distribution and location of the accommodation selected.85. We recommend, therefore, that the Ministry of Health should be required to draw up schemes for the provision of emergency accommodation, in conjunction with the Board of Trade in regard to food supply, and that, when decisions have been reached in regard to estimated numbers and location, the Ministry of Transport should he advised so that railway facilities may be prearranged.86. Out of the adoption of this policy of evacuation of all those whose services are not required, rises the question of the continuance of the education of the large number of children, who may thus be leaving London and its vicinity. We have had a preliminary consultation with representatives of the Board of Education on this aspect of the problem and we recommend that that Department should be requested to consider the policy which should be adopted in regard to schools, and if removal to less exposed areas is deemed practicable, to draw up schemes for the extension of educational facilities in these areas so as to accommodate pupils who normally attend schools in London and those provincial towns which may be the objective of hostile air attack. The choice of suitable centres for this purpose will of course be largely dependent on those selected by the Ministry of Health for the accommodation of refugees, and therefore these two Departments should be asked to work out a solution of the problem in close collaboration87. In order to enlist the co-operation of the public we consider that, when the emergency occurs, full instructions should be issued by the Government (i.) Pointing out the necessity of maintaining Londons vital activities and the consequent importance of men and women of all classes remaining at their work ;(ii.) Encouraging those whose functions are dispensable, especially women andchildren, to leave the Metropolis as quickly as possible ; (hi.) Urging the need for avoiding panic ; and(iv.) Advertising the arrangements which have been made for transportation and accommodation.88. To ensure that these instructions are carried out and to allay any signs of panic, the services of the Police will be needed. The Police organisation, too, will be a very useful medium for the distribution of any further orders or instructions. For this reason we recommend that the Home Office should he vested with responsibility for the control of movements of large masses of the population.89. So far in this connection mention has only been made of the human element. We consider that movable property of real value should also be placed out of harm&apos;b reach, and we. consequently recommend that the Office of Works should be charged
with, the responsibility of conveying National Art Treasures and other movable property of national value to a place of safety ; and of devising means for the protection of important records, such as those lodged in Somerset House, the removal of which to a place of safety is not a feasible operation.90. Summary of Recommendations.(i.) That the Ministry of Health, in conjunction with the Board of Trade, should draw up schemes for the accommodation and feeding of London&apos;s refugees. (Paragraph 85.) (ii.) That the Board of Education should draw up schemes, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, for the extension of educational facilities in the areas selected for the accommodation of refugees. (Paragraph 86.)(iii.) That the Ministry of Transport should be advised of the localities selected and estimated numbers involved in these schemes, so that necessary transport arrangements can be worked out in advance. (Paragraph 85.)(iv.) That the Government should issue either in their general Proclamation (see paragraph 22), or in the form of an official communique, immediately on the outbreak of hostilities, a notice (a.)  Pointing out the necessity   of  maintaining  London&apos;s  vitalactivities and the consequent importance of men and women of all classes remaining at their work. (b.) Encouraging those whose functions are dispensable especiallywomen and children to leave the Metropolis as quickly aspossible.(c.) Urging the need for avoiding all panic.   (Paragraph 87.)(v.) That the control of movement of large masses of the population shouldbe vested in the Home Office. (Paragraph 88.) (vi.) That the Office of Works should be responsible for the lodging of National Art Treasures and other movable property of national value in a place of safety, and for the devising of means to protect important records, the removal of which is not a feasible operation. (Paragraph 89.)PART V.MAINTENANCE OF VITAL SERVICES. (I.) General.91. We have considered the question of the maintenance of vital services-generally, and have not in any case entered into a very detailed examination, for we felt that it was no part of our duty to frame concrete proposals in regard to matters which are properly the concern of the various Departments of State.92. We have, therefore, confined ourselves to compiling a list of the various schemes which we consider should be drawn up by the Departments concerned against contingencies which may arise in the event of air attack, and we have held discussions with representatives of these Departments with the twofold object of acquainting them with the nature of the problem as we envisage it, and of securing agreement as to the incidence of responsibility for the schemes enumerated.93. A detailed list of these schemes under each Department of State is included in Schedule III to this Report.94. The drafting of many of these schemes will entail a considerable amount of work, and will necessitate enquiries being conducted over a wide range of activities outside Government circles. Much time will therefore elapse before any degree of finality can be reached.95. In order that this work might be commenced without delay we considered it advisable to secure authority to take outside experts into consultation.   As already
(III.) Food supply.104. This subject, so far as two of its most important aspects, viz., the vulnerability of the LonJon Docks, and the Diversion of Shipping from the English Channel are concerned, has been referred to other Committees. There are,- however two further issues in regard to food supply which  the investigations  of these&quot;mentioned this authority was granted by the Committee of Imperial Defence at the 194th Meeting on the 6th February, l!)25.96. We suggest that it would be advisable for all the schemes as they are completed to be submitted for consideration to us or to some other body constituted for the purpose. We recommend this course, not because we wish to subject the work of the various Departments to critical examination, but because we wish to ensure that their proposals are co-ordinated, brought into a single general plan, and meet all the possible contingencies which we are able to foresee at present and which may be brought to our notice from time to time in the future.(II.) Provision of Personnel.97. There is one element in this part of the general problem which affects the maintenance of all vital services, viz., the human element. Unless men are willing, or can be persuaded, to continue working; under admittedly very trying conditions, the best laid schemes of Committees and Departments will miscarry. Can any, and, if so, what, inducements be held out to cause meu to remain at their posts ?98. In this connection we would point out once again the absolute necessity for London&apos;s vital activities to be maintained at all costs. The individuals affected&apos; will not be only those engaged in military or quasi-military occupations, such as the manufacture or munitions, but the whole of Loadods citizens, who, for one reason or another, have been required to remain at their work. No practical distinction can be drawn, for example, between the clerk working in a Government Department, a Bank, or a merchants office in the City, or those engaged in railway work and other essential transport undertakings. The need for the retention of the services of each will be the same. The dangers to which all will be exposed will be identical. For this.reason we consider that plans should be drawn up whereby pensions would be granted to persons disabled by hostile air action, or an insurance scheme devised whereby individuals engaged in bombardment areas could obtain cover at Government assisted rates, and we recommend that the Treasury should be requested to draw up a scheme for this purpose in consultation with the Departments concerned.99. In case these inducements should not prove sufficient to retain at work the large numbers of men and women who will undoubtedly be required, we think that schemes should be prepared in advance, whereby workers would be enrolled in order to secure discipline. This, question will require further exploration, and should, we consider, be referred to a special committee set up for this purpose, which should work in close collaboration with the Man-Power Committee.100. There is also another aspect of this personnel problem to which we wish to draw attention. As has been stated before, air attack will probably be delivered in its greatest intensity immediately on the outbreak of hostilities, and so it is essential that the personnel required to augment existing services and to man additional emergency services should be available without any delay. The time available will not permit exhaustive enquiries to bo conducted into the age and medical category of individuals.101, Further, we consider that the duties on which these men will be engaged will be of such importance to the general welfare of the community and to the .active prosecution of the war, that no break should be allowed to occur in the continuity of their work, aud that, therefore, men so engaged should not be taken away for any purpose until such time as suitable substitutes have been provided.102. It is not possible, until the Departments concerned have drawn up their schemes, to furnish an estimate of the numbers which will be required. We have, however, deemed it, advisable to draw the attention of&apos; the Man-Power Committee to this aspect of the problem at an early stage, and have asked them to give us the benefit of their advice as to how the conditions which we envisage can best be fulfilled. We attach as Schedule IV a list of the various services for which we consider men will be required in the contingency contemplated.103. Apart from these general observations we add the following remarks in regard to the particular services which we have had under consideration : 
Committees will leave untouched and which we consider should form the subject of further enquiry, namely : (i.) The maintenance of the machinery of distribution in London and other important centres which may be the object of attack, and (ii.) The provision of adequate supplies to centres where the normal means of supply are likely to be overburdened by the influx of a large number of refugees.As more than one Department is concerned in these matters we think that the enquiry in this direction could best be conducted by a small Committee.(IV.)-Transport Services.105. All forms of transport rail, road and canal are included under this heading. As already indicated, we have discussed the question of railway transport with the General Managers of the four main railway groups and other aspects with representatives of the Ministry of Transport. Since all forms of transport properly fall within the jurisdiction of one Department, we recommend that the Ministry of Transport should be requested to prepare the schemes which we have enumerated under this heading in Schedule III of our report.106. One point.to which we think it advisable to draw attention here is the possibility that, in the event of heavy &quot; gas &quot; attacks, water-borne transport may prove more reliable and more easy to maintain than either road or railway services.(V.) Water Supply.107. This is a matter for the Ministry of Health, and has been included under that Department in Schedule III. The possibility of contamination of water supplies by dropping deleterious substances into reservoirs should not be ignored.(VI.) Lighting and Power Supply.108. So far as electrical services are concerned, maintenance is the concern of the Electricity Commissioners, and we have had the benefit of the advice of the Chairman of that body, Sir John Sneil, on the subject. We understand from him that, although the erection of very large power stations is projected in the near future, yet these stations will be interconnected in such a way as to obviate the possibility of complete interruption in the event of damage to one station. We have assigned the responsibility for the maintenance of electrical services to the Ministry of Transport, as the Department to which the Electricity Commissioners are now attached.109. The maintenance of gas supplies is the concern of the Board of Trade. We have been given to understand that so far as London is concerned, supply is practically dependent on the output of two main undertakings the South Metropolitan Gas Company and the Gas Light and Coke Company. What measures can be adopted to maintain supplies, and whether it is possible to make these two sources of supply interchangeable, are problems for the Board of Trade, under which Department the drafting of schemes for this purpose has been included in Schedule III of our Report. The Board are, we understand, already examining the problem in conjunction with the undertakings concerned.(VII.) Post, Telegraph and Telephone Services.110. The telephone is destined to play so important a part in all anti-aircraft measures that we have been particularly anxious to ensure that no means should be neglected which would minimise the chances of interruption to telephonic commvmi-cations. The most effective measure of protection would be found in the scattering of the Exchanges. We have been given to understand, however, that financial considerations make this course impracticable, and that even if the necessary funds were available, so great a delay would be introduced thereby into the present programme of expansion as to render its adoption extremely inadvisable. In these circumstances we have deliberately refrained from making any specific recommenda-tion,. but have included the maintenance of the services of communication under the General Post Office in Schedule III of our Report, so that the requirements of anti-aircraft protection shall not be overlooked when drafting programmes of development in the future.
-      111. Summary of Recommendations-(i.) That  the  Treasury should be requested to draw up schemes for pensions&apos; or insurance as an inducement to individuals to remain at their work.   (Paragraph 98.) (ii.) That a special committee should be established to draw up schemes forthe enrolment of workers to ensure discipline.   (Paragraph 99.) (iii.) That the Man-Power Committee should be requested to consider the measures  necessary  to  ensure  that  personnel  for  anti-aircraft protection services shall be readily available on the outbreak of hostilities, and shall not be withdrawn until efficient substitutes have been provided.    (Paragraph 102.) (iv.) That a Committee should be constituted to investigate (a) the best means of maintaining the machinery of distribution in London and other objectives of hostile attack ; and (b) the provision of necessary supplies to areas congested  by the influx of large numbers of refugees.   (Paragraph 104.) (v.) That the following Depaitments should be requested to draft schemes for  maintaining  and safeguarding the  vital  services  indicated below : (a.) Ministry of Transport   ...    Transportation Services.   (Para-graph 105.) Electrical     Supplies.       (Para-graph 108.)(6.) Ministry of Health        ...   Water   Supplies.      (Paragraph107.)(c.) Board of Trade ...    Gas Supplies.   (Paragraph 109.)(d.) General Post Office       ...   Post, Telephone and telegraph services.   (Paragraph 110.)(vi.) That all schemes when completed should be submitted to the Air Raids Precautions Committee, or some other body constituted for the purpose, to ensure that all contingencies which have or can be foreseen have been provided,, against, and that all proposals are co-ordinated and brought into a single general plan.&apos;   (Paragraph 96.)PART VI. REPAIR OF DAMAGE.112. Under this heading we include generally all services which may be necessary to render treatment to persons who may become casualties and to ,effect repairs to property.113. Subject to our remarks in the preceding chapter on the provision of personnel, which are equally applicable to these services, we consider attention should be drawn to the following points : (I.) Medical Services.114. From the estimates of the&apos;Air Staff, casualties amounting to, approximately,. 2,500 every twenty-four hours must be anticipated. Arrangements will have therefore-to be made in peace-time to ensure that sufficient medical practitioners and adequate hospital accommodation will be available immediately on the outbreak of hostilities. Provision also will be necessary for the evacuation of. the wounded outside the area of bombardment, aud machinery will have to be contrived for the burial of the dead and the registration of their graves. In fact, an organisation almost identical with that devised to deal with the casualties of an army will be required to meet the needs of the civil population in the contingency contemplated. This aspect of the problem properly falls within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, and&apos;we recommend, that this Department should be requested to draw up schemes for these purposes.. .      (II.) Ambulance Services.115. The various Ambulance Services in London will be called upon to play a. very important part in the event of serious attack.   We understand that at the present time a great variety of authorities and organisations are involved in the control of these services.   If the best results are to be obtained from their efforts, it seems to us [13297] D
1:8essential that their activities should be co-ordinated, and for this a central organisation is required. We recommend, therefore, that the Ministry of Health should be requested to examine this problem and draw up a scheme whereby the activities of all the available Ambulance Services could be controlled, put to the most efficient use and enlarged if the situation renders such a course necessary.(III.) Fire Brigades.116. Very much the same situation exists to-day in regard to Fire Brigades as in the case of Ambulance Services. The number of authorities involved is, we understand, considerable, and there is no measure of central control. Further, we have been informed that the Fire Brigades have no reserves on which they can call in an emergency and that a large proportion of their personnel consists of Naval Reservists. &apos;We are of the opinion that, in the circumstances contemplated, abnormal demands are certain to be made on the services of the Fire Brigades, especially in London, and we therefore recommend that the Home Office should be requested to draw up schemes which will enable a central control to be established and an adequate service to be made available immediately the emergency arises.(IV.) Clearance Paeties.117. Considerable destruction of property is inevitable, and portions of buildings will remain standing whose condition is unsafe and whose demolition is necessary in the interests of the public. All this debris will have to be cleared away, if obstruction to traffic and other services is to be avoided, and we recommend that the Ministry of Health should be requested to arrange for this work to be carried out, in conjunction with the local authorities. The maintenance of Road Communication is the care of the Ministry of Transport, and for this reason we recommend that this Department should be asked to draw up schemes for the organisation and employment of Road Repair- Gangs for this purpose.118. Summary of Recommendations.That the allocation of departmental responsibility should be as follows :  (i.) Ministry of Health.(a.) Medical treatment of casualties, including co-ordination of existing Ambulance Services and their expansion if necessary.(b.). Hospital accommodation.(c.) Evacuation of wounded outside area of bombardment. (d.) Burial of the dead, te.) Registration of graves. (/.)  Clearance of debris.(Paragraph? 114, 115 and 117.)(ii.) Home Office.Co-ordination of Fire Brigade and their expansion if necessary (Paragraph 1 1 6.) (hi.; Ministry of Transport.Establishment of Road Repair Gangs.   (Paragraph 117.)PART VII.MOVEMENT OF THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT.119. We have given considerable thought to this aspect of the problem, as we feel that its correct solution is of the very first importance. Removal of the seat of Government immediately on the outbreak of war might be advantageous, both from the point of view of avoiding interruption to the course of administration, and also from the point of view of separating the administrative machine from those commercial and industrial activities which we are convinced must remain in London.120. On the other hand, a general exodus of all the main Government Depart-ments might occasion so great a moral depression in the country and throughout the Empire, as to amount almost to a disaster in itself. We consider, therefore, that it is essential to reject such a course in principle.121. Nevertheless, the majority of Government offices are concentrated in so small n area that we think the damage of some, at least, must be accepted as inevitable.
122. We have considered the advisability of earmarking accommodation on the outskirts of London as a measure of evasion, which would avoid the possible consequences of complete evacuation and also those of over-concentration. We believe, however, that such a course would be attended with considerable dislocation, since, no matter what area was selected, the majority of the personnel engaged, having made their domestic arrangements with, a view to access to their work in the neighbour-hood of Whitehall, would need to traverse the breadth of London to reach their new offices. Further, we believe that the administrative inconvenience occasioned by such a large measure of dispersion would render the adoption of such a course inadvisable.123. For these reasons we recommend that Government Departments should remain in their present offices as long as circumstances will permit and that to provide&apos;against the possible destruction of any of these offices, the Office of Works should be requested to prepare schemes for alternative accommodation, which accommodation should be situated within a radius of two miles of Whitehall.124. If owing to destruction or damage by enemy action partial removal is necessitated, we consider that those Departments which are least concerned with the active prosecution of the war should be the first to be required to move, and that the classification of Departments for this purpose should be determined in the near future. In this way administration would be facilitated, since those Departments which require to work in close co-operation on current war measures would remain in close proximity to one another for the longest possible period.125. Lastly, if, owing to enemy action, complete evacuation should become necessary, we think it advisable that a suitable alternative centre for the seat of Government should be selected beforehand. From our investigations it appears that Birmingham and Liverpool are best adapted for this purpose. The former in admittedly not beyond aircraft range at the present time, but possesses good facilities for communication of all kinds, contains suitable buildings and has this great advantage that it is not located near any outstanding physical feature which might act as a guide to hostile air formations. Liverpool, on the other hand, though out of aircraft range at present and equally well endowed as regards buildings and communications, has the disadvantage of being, as a seaport, more conspicuous from the air.126. We have deliberately refrained from framing auy more definite recom-mendations in this respect as we feel that the question of removal of the seat of Government is one of high policy, which can only be settled by the Ministers of the Urown in office at the time.127. Summary of Recommendations.(i.) That all Government Departments should continue to work in their normal offices, as long as circumstances permit.   (Paragraph 123.)(ii.) That, should partial removal become necessary, those Departments which a.re not concerned with the active prosecution of the war should be required to move first, and that the classification of Departments for this purpose should be determined in advance and an appropriate entry made in the War Book.    (Paragraph 124.)(iii.) That the Office of Works should be required to prepare schemes for alternative accommodation which should be located within a radius of two miles from Whitehall.    (Paragraph .123.)(iv.) That removal of the seat. of Government is a matter of high policy which can only be determined by Ministers in office at the time ; but that an alternative centre should be selected and a scheme for the accommodation of Government Offices at that centre should be prepared and kept up to date by the Office of Works, against such, an eventuality.   (Paragraphs 125 and 126.)PART VIII.FORM OF CONTROL.128. Air attack, even if not deliberately directed against the civil population, will almost certainly be aimed at such military objectives as railways, munition works and Government Departments. Obviously, therefore, the effect on the civil population will be very considerable, though only incidental, and on the manner in which bombardment is borne by the civil population the issue of the conflict will largely depend, in these [13297] - D 2
circumstances the nature of the control imposed on the civil population becomes a matter of the very first importance.129. The situation, as we envisage it, will require that the following conditions should be fulfilled : (i.) That the form of control shall be applicable to the whole mass of the population ;(ii.) That it shall be capable of application immediately on the outbreak of hostilities; and(iii.) That, while it assures amenability to discipline, it shall at the same time interfere as little as possible with the vital activities of the nation and the normal duties of individuals.130. To comply with these conditions, the system adopted must be one which can be readily evolved from ordinary peace-time machinery, can be imposed without delay and be attended with as few restrictions as possible, and can be of simultaneous and universal application throughout the country.131. Two courses are open either military control or some form of civilian control.132. By military control we understand a system whereby authority is vested in the War Office and exercised through local military commanders. Though such a system would certainly ensure the requisite measure of compliance with discipline, we doubt whether it is otherwise suited to the needs of the situation. A military regime in these circumstances must of necessity be of an improvised character. The ordinary peace-time duties of soldiers do not involve that intimate contact with, and daily supervision of, large masses of the civilian population which the conditions contemplated will demand. Nor does the normal distribution of the Army lend itself to the assumption of control throughout the country at very short notice. Further, the additional burdens which would thus be thrown on the military machine would&quot; probably prove a very considerable embarrassment at a time when the services of every trained man will be required for the conduct of active fighting operations.133. The form of civilian control which suggests itself as an alternative is one whereby authority would be vested in the Home Office and exercised through the Police in co-operation with Local Authorities. Such a system offers the following advantages. The Police, by the nature of their duties, are brought into daily contact with the civilian population ; they are trained to control large masses -; they are dispersed throughout the country in rough proportion to the number of inhabitants. Their personnel is stable, both in composition and distribution, and their organisation admits of rapid expansion, by the enrolment of special constables, should the necessity for such a course arise. Further, the additional: duties and responsibilities which the Police would be called upon to assume in the circumstances would be but an extension of the duties and responsibilities which they have been accustomed to exercise for years. The minimum of delay should therefore result in putting emergency measures into operation, as there would be no break in the existing chain of responsibility and no interruption to the continuity of control. The organisation and training of personnel could be undertaken in advance, and thus the passage from peace to war-time conditions would not be attended by any drastic alterations in the machinery of administration, any complicated transfer of duties, nor any new alignment of responsibilities.134. For these reasons we consider that the second alternative is better suited to the needs of the situation, and we recommend, therefore, that control should be vested departmentally in the Home Office and exercised through the police organisation, and that the measures required to enable the police organisation to cope with these additional responsibilities should be examined and the necessary alterations put into effect at an early date.135. Summary of Recommendations.That control should be vested departmentally in the Home Office and exercised through the police organisation (paragraph 134).PART IX.A NTI-GAS M KASURES.136. In so far as the particular requirements to meet &quot; gas &quot; attacks are concerned, we have had the benefit of the advice of the Chemical Warfare Committee,
whose very valuable paper on &quot; The Protection of the Civil Population against Gas &quot; has been communicated to the Committee of Imperial Defence (G.I.D. Paper No. 1 34-A).137. In this paper the Chemical Warfare Committee suggest two measures which are at variance with our proposals, viz. :  (i.) The form of control to be adopted ;(ii.) The issue of warnings to the General Public.We, therefore, considered it advisable to discuss these particular points with a representative of the Chemical Warfare Committee, as a result of which discussion, on learning the reasons which had influenced us in these aspects of the problem, they have concurred with our proposals.138. One reason, which has weighed with us, in recommending against the issue of a general alarm in the initial stages of hostilities, is that we have been informed that France which from her geographical position could inflict the greatest damage on us, if at war has adopted a formula undertaking to refrain from the use of offensive gas as a weapon of war provided that her antagonist makes a similar undertaking, a course which we understand Hip lajesty&apos;s Government have recently decided to adopt. We understand also that the Washington Convention on the subject of the use of noxious gases and chemicals has recently been reaffirmed by the League of Nations Conference on the Arms Traffic, at which most of the nations of the world, including Germany, were represented.139. We are not competent to gauge the measure of faith which can be reposed in international engagements, and we realise that, in view of our experience in the last war, an enemy contemplating the use of poison gas would not find it difficult to manufacture a plausible pretext for his action. Nevertheless, we feel .that^it. is unlikely that gas will be employed against us at the very commencement of hostilities, and that, therefore, time will be available to learn from actual experience whether a general alarm is necessary or not.140. Apart from these two points, on which our differences have already been reconciled, we have no comments to make on the proposals of the Chemical Warfare Committee. For the sake of greater emphasis, however, we think it advisable to refer quite briefly to certain measures which we consider should receive special attention, viz. : (i.) The Service of &quot; decontamination &quot; is one which we regard as of the highest importance. Unless the effects of gas particularly &quot; mustard &quot; gas can be rapidly cleared away, there will be danger of large areas having to&apos; be completely segregated for long periods of time, which may result in very considerable dislocation in vital national activities. We recommend, therefore, that steps should be taken at an early stage to ensure that means are available to carry out this service effectively and rapidly.(ii.) To render rooms &quot;gas-proof does not appear to present any great difficulty, but to render buildings &quot; gas-proof &quot; is an undertaking of a very different order. ..Yet, if work in Government and other offices is to be maintained, an effective method of &quot;gas-proofing&quot; is essential. We recommend, therefore, that the Office of Works should be required to investigate this problem in consultation with the Chemical Warfare Committee, (iii.) The training of the police in anti-gas measures and in the use of respirators and protective clothing is necessary if they are to be able to carry out the duties assigned to them. We recommend, therefore, that this training should be commenced, without delay.(iv.) The anticipated reduction in the number of casualties from a gas attack, where there is knowledge of its nature and of the measures to be taken to guard against its effects, is, in our opinion, very significant and points to the advisability of spreading this knowledge as widely as possible.141, In the event, however, of the employment of gas becoming a predominant feature of air warfare in the future, the difficulties of protecting the civil population will be greatly enhanced. We think, therefore, that the situation should be closely watched with a view to ensuring that plans of a more detailed and more elaborate nature shall be devised to meet the needs of such a contingency, should it seem likely to eventuate.142. Summary of Recommendations.(i.) That steps should be taken at an early stage to ensure that means are available to carry out &quot; decontamination &quot; effectively and rapidly.

(Paragraph 140 (iv).)PART X.LEGISLATIVE POWERS REQUIRED.143. It is not possible at this stage of our enquiries to enumerate the points on which legislation will be necessary, but when Departments have had time to work out their various schemes the details requiring legislative action will become manifest We recommend, therefore, that Departments should take up these points direct with the War Emergency Legislation Committee, which is already in being.144. Summary of Recommendations That Departments should take up direct with the War Emergency Legislation Committee any points in regard to their schemes which require legislative action.   (Paragraph 143.)PART XI.DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL ACTION RECOMMENDED.145 In Schedule III we have shown in tabular form, for convenience of reference, under each Department of State the action for which we recommend that each Department should be held responsible. This list does not purport to be-exhaustive, and will need to be enlarged and modified as a more detailed examination of the whole problem is conducted.   It will, however, suffice to initiate these enquiries.PART XII. CONCLUSION.140. The ground covered by this report can only be regarded as a preliminary survey of the very wide area comprised within our terms of reference. Before any comprehensive plan of protection for the civil population in the circumstances contemplated can be adopted a vast amount of detailed work wilpbe necessary. We consider that this work should be commenced without delay, and that a Standing Committee should be set up, not&apos;for the purpose of examining each scheme as it is conceived and reduced to form, but rather to supervise their interactions on one another and to ensure that all the component parts are brought together and dovetailed into a comprehensive well-balanced and efficient plan.147. We think it as well to emphasise here once again that the recommendations outlined above should be regarded as palliatives only. Adequate protection of the civil population can only be secured by the vigorous prosecution of an active offensive campaign which will carry the war into the enemy&apos;s country and subject his people to conditions even more trying than those which our own people will be called upon to endure.1.48. Summary of Recommendations  Education of the Public. (I.) That the education of the public to a realisation of the full significance of aerial attack is a matter of vital importance.  (Paragraphs 19-30.) (2.) That a proclamation should be prepared for issue immediately on theoutbreak of hostilities, warning the public of the conditions likelyto be encountered and exhorting them to meet these conditions withcourage and endurance.   (Paragraph 22.)
The Warning System.(3.) That there should be a fully worked out system of warning, which can be put into operation or not as circumstances dictate when the emergency arises, and that the details of this system should be worked out by the Home Office in consultation with the Air Ministry, the War Office and the General Post Office.   (Paragraph 36.) (4.) That the services of the police should be utilised in the organisation of the warning system, and that special constables to be trained as observers should be enrolled in an Observation Corps for this purpose.   (Paragraph 39.) (5.) That aerial attack should be divided into two classes &quot;Mass Attacks&quot; and &quot; raids &quot; and that the Air Staff should be constituted the competent authority to decide on the definition of each.   This decision to be promulgated before the actual outbreak of hostilities.   An appro-priate note to be entered in the Air Ministry Chapter of the War Book to this effect.   (Paragraphs 43-44.) (6.) That &quot; Mass Attacks &quot; should be considered pioper occasions for the issue of warnings, and &quot; raids &quot; should be disregarded for all purposes of warning to civil organisations.   (Paragraph 45.) (7.) That the issue of a &quot;general alarm&quot; should be deprecated, but left tothe discretion of local authorities. (Paragraph 47.) (8.)

(Paragraph 47.) (9.) That the necessary apparatus for the sounding of an alarm should be held in readiness by those organisations responsible for its actual issue.   (Paragraph 47.)(10.) That the preliminary warning should be issued to such authorities and organisations as require time to put their anti-aircraft measures into operation, i.e., public safety organisations (such as police, fire brigades, salvage and ambulance corps) and industrial undertakings (such as explosive factories, blast furnaces,&apos;&amp;c).   (Paragraph 50.)(11.) That the second warning should be issued to Public and Industrial Undertakings and Public Institutions which can materially profrc by the receipt of a warning.   (Paragraph 51.)(12.) That the number of recipients of both these warnings should be as limited as circumstances permit.   (Paragraph 52.)(13.) That the Home Office should be charged with the compilation of lists under both headings, which lists should be brought under review and amended periodically.   (Paragraph 52.)(14.) That military units, other than those actively engaged against the enemy, should comply with the measures adopted for the remainder of the community, but that discretionary latitude should be left to commanders in this respect, on the understanding that priority for the distribution of warnings cannot be accorded on Post Office telephone lines except in very special cases.   (Paragraph 53.)Lighting Restrictions.-(15.) That the best method of restricting lighting for anti-aircraft purposes should be determined by experiment.   (Paragraph 59.)&apos;(16.) That the issue of Regulations in regard to lighting should be vested inone Central Authority -the Home Office.   (Paragraph 60.) (17.) That the Fighting Services should be reqrured to conform with these regulations in respect of property under their control, but should have authority to grant exemption where special circumstances render such exemption necessary.   (Paragraph 60.)(18.) That the Admiralty, in consultation with the Air Ministry, should be requested to consider the question of suppression or modification of navigational lights for anti-aircraft purposes.   (Paragraph 61.)-(19.) That &quot; Fishing Lights &quot; are unlikely to afford any material assistance to a potential enemy and can, therefore, be ignored. (Paragraph 62.)
(20.) That for the sake of simplicity regulations in regard to restrictions of lighting to meet naval and military requirements should be embodied in the regulations drawn up by the Home Office for anti-aircraft purposes.   (Paragraph 63.)Provision of Protection.(21.) That the War Office, in consultation with the Air Ministry and Office of Works, should conduct experiments with the object of ascer-taining the forces developed on detonation of bombs weighing 500 lbs. and upwards, and their effect on buildings of various kinds.

(Paragraph 85.)(24.) That the Board of Education should draw up schemes, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, for the extension of educational facilities in- the areas selected for the accommodation of refugees. , (Paragraph 86.)(25.) That the Ministry of Transport should be advised of the localities selected and estimated numbers involved in these schemes, so that necessary transport arrangements can be worked out in advance. (Paragraph 85.)(26.) That the Government should issue, either in their General Proclama-tion (vide paragraph 22) or in the form of an official communique; immediately on the outbreak of hostilities, a notice (a.) Pointing out the necessity of maintaining  London&apos;s vital activities and the consequent importance of men and women of all classes remaining at their work ; (b.) Encouraging those whose functions are dispensable especially women and children-to leave the Metropolis as quickly . , as.possible; .(c.) Urging the need for avoiding all panic.   (Paragraph 87.)(27.) That the control of movement of large masses of the population should be vested in the Home Office.   (Paragraph 88.)(28.)

APPENDIX  A.Appreciation by the Air staff of the Scale of Attack. Air Staff Notes on Enemy Air Attack on Defended Zones in Great Britain. Introduction.1. At the present time France is the only Power which maintains a powerful air force within striking distance of Great Britain.The estimated potentiality of the French air force, therefore, is used as a basis for calculating the air defence measures necessary for this country.Scale of A attack.2. It is estimated by the Air Staff that, in the event of war, France would be in a position to attack England with a strength of 456 bombing aircraft, capable of carrying approximately 174 tons of bombs.In addition, there would be available a certain number of civil aircraft carrying approximately 25 tons of bombs.3. It is considered that the French could not operate the whole of their available bombing aircraft daily, but that, in order to achieve the greatest effect they would probably put forth their maximum strength at the outset.The scale of attack that may reasonably be anticipated is : First 24 hours : 100 per cent. ^ 200 tons bombs (approximately). Second 24 hours : 75 per cent. = 150 tons bombs (approximately). Subsequently:        50 per cent. ^ 100 tons bombs (approximately).Duration of A attack.4. The period for which the 50 per cent, scale of attack is continued is entirely dependent upon the strength and efficiency of the counter-offensive of our bombing aircraft. Until it has been tested by actual experience it is impossible to calculate accurately what the effect of this counter-offensive will be.There is no doubt, however, that as our air superiority over the enemy becomes established, and provided our bombing attack is pressed home with the maximum strength and vigour, the numbers of enemy aircraft launched against us will gradually diminish-perhaps not noticeably in the first month, but afterwards gradually and continually.Effectiveness of A attack.5. There are no statistics available from the last war which show what percentage of aircraft flying long distances were able to penetrate a highly-organised air defence system. It is therefore necessary to estimate this figure arbitrarily for French aircraft attempting to attack objectives inside the British air defence zones.6. In the opinion of the Air Staff it would be dangerous to assume that more than 50 per cent, of the bombing aircraft launched against London will fail to drop their bombs on some part of the target.For the first month of the war this figure is thought to be the absolute minimum, considering the possibility of surprises in methods and material.Objectives for Enemy Air Attack.7. The Air Staff consider that, though a certain amount of bombing attack on ports, shipping and industrial centres outside the defence zones may be anticipated, London will be the primary objective for French air attack.Bombs dropped on London.8. Weight. On this basis, therefore, in a war with France, we must anticipate the following weights of bombs dropped on London: First 24 hours       ... ... ....      75   tons by day25   tons by nightSecond 24 hours     ... ... ...       56   tons by day19   tons by nightEvery subsequent 24 hours ...       37-1 toris by day] ,        -,&quot;&apos;r&apos;f 1.2-^ tons by night[1 3297] . . f
9. Type, At the present time the bombs used by aircraft are of roughly three types :-(a.) High explosive with thin case for demolition effect.(b.) High explosive with thick case for fragmentation effect.(c.) Incendiary which scatter small fires over a large area.10. As far as is known at present the French have not developed a bomb suitable for carrying lethal gas in such concentrations as to make them of more material and moral value than an equal weight of high explosive bomb.Also, France is a signatory to the Convention prohibiting the use of gas, and it is considered that at this stage the precautionary measures necessary for protection against this form of attack need not be exhaustively examined.The possibility, however, cannot be entirely ignored, and will call for careful reconsideration from time to time in the near future.Material Effect.11. Possible developments in the power of high explosive bombs is largely a matter of conjecture, as is also the efficiency of incendiary bombs.Explosive Bombs.12. A bomb containing 1,650 lbs. of Amatol has been found to make a hole in the ground about 15 feet deep and 30 feet to 40 feet in diameter. What would be the effect of a 2,000 lb. bomb in penetration or on a well-constructed building cannot be estimated, but the Air Staff are inclined to think that, except in the case of certain places naturally protected, such as &quot; tubes,&quot; it will be generally impracticable to provide protection against the possibility of a direct hit by a large bomb.Protection, however, against damage and injury from fragments or near misses is practicable and should be organised.Incendiary Bombs.13. From what is known of the present type of French incendiary bomb it is not considered that it offers any very serious menace to modern buildings in London.It would, however, be dangerous if used particularly against factories or stores containing inflammable or explosive material, or in conjunction with explosive bombs, and precautions will need to be taken on this account.Casualties.14. In the Appendix attached, statistics available of casualties caused by German bomb attack in the last war are examined.From this it will be seen that in the view of the Air Staff, a reasonable basis for calculating casualties from air attack in the future, is approximately : 17 killed, 33 wounded; total 50, per ton of bombs dropped.15. On this basis, therefore in a war with France, casualties must be anticipated on the following approximate scale : Killed.     Wounded.     Total. First24 hours   ... ...      1,700 3,300 5,000Second 24 hours ... . .      1,275 2,475 3,750Every subsequent 24 hours 850 1,650 2,50016. In the opinion of the Air Staff the above figures form a conservative estimate of the casualties which may be incurred in London at the commencement of the war, but a reasonable estimate for shortly after the commencement when it is anticipated the population will have been considerably reduced and has become better practised in self-protective measures.17. The possibilities should the enemy resort to the use of gas bombs are not considered, but it is pointed out that one ton of &quot; mustard &quot; gas suitably distributed is estimated to render uninhabitable for some considerable time an area of 1 square mile.Moral Effect.18. It is well known that the moral effect of air attack is out of all proportion greater than the material results achieved.
While, therefore, serious material damage may be expected from bomb attack, the most probable cause of chaos in the community will be the moral collapse of the personnel employed in the working of the vital public services, such as transport, lighting, water and food distribution.19. In this connection it must be borne in mind that a large proportion of the enemy attack will be directed against arsenals and munition factories, which are normally closely surrounded by a section of the population which may be particularly susceptible to attacks on their moral.20. The Home Office are in possession of facts relative to the loss of output in factories, dislocation of communications and loss in moral of the civilian population of London which took place in the last war, and from these figures must be estimated the effect of bomb attack on the scale anticipated in a war with France.The Scale of Air Attack on Ports.Diversion of Shipping from certain Ports.Food Supply in time of War.21. The above questions are under consideration by the Air Staff for another Committee, and they are therefore not dealt with in this paper.Conclusion.22. Having in mind the results achieved by the spasmodic and comparatively light attacks of German aircraft in the last war, it would appear well-nigh impossible to solve the problem of precautions against air attack of the scale and intensity estimated in the foregoing paragraphs.While, however, the Air Staff consider it would be inadvisable to anticipate air attack of less than this scale and effectiveness, they would re-emphasise their opinion (as expressed in paragraph 4) that the determining factor will be the strength of the counter attack that can be carried out by our bombing aircraft.Air Staff-, May 28, 1924.Appendix.(Secret.)Air Staff Notes on Bombing Casualties among the Civil Population.1. Some uncertainty appears to exist with regard to the casualties which may be expected in this and similar countries as the result of bomb raids on the centres of civil population.2. The following information is therefore published, which, it is thought, will prove of assistance in computing casualties for Staff and other Exercises.3. The total casualties in the British Isles caused by German bombing during the late war were : -Killed ... ... ... ... 1,413Wounded ... ... ... ... 3,407Total casualties      ... ... ... 4,820Approximately 300 tons of bombs were dropped by hostile aircraft.Taking these figures, the average casualties per ton of bombs dropped were : Per ton.Killed ... ... ... ... 4.7Wounded ... ... ... ... 11.3&apos; Total casualties      ... ... ... 16It is pointed out, however, that the figures quoted above include raids by single aeroplanes on coast towns, bombs dropped at night by airships in country districts; in fact, every type of sporadic attack.In bomb raids carried out by large formations of aircraft on crowded industrial areas, such as London, a considerably higher proportion of casualties may be expected. This is borne out by the statistics of the casualties in London during the attacks carried out by German aeroplanes in 1917-18.

Daylight raids on London, of which there were two : First Raid June 13, 1917.Number of aeroplanes    ...     .   ... ...            14Tons of bombs dropped   ...          .... ...             4JCasualties Killed             ...         ...         ... ... ^        162Wounded         ...         ....... 532Total         ...         ...          ....... 694The average casualties per ton of bombs dropped were : Killed              ...         ...          ... 38Wounded         ...         ... 125Total         ...         ...         ...        ...... 163Second Raid July 7, 1917.Number of aeroplanes     ...          ...         ... 22Tons of bombs dropped   ...          ...         ... 3 Casualties Killed              ...         ...          ...         ... 57Wounded         ...         ...          ...         ... 193Total         ...         ...          ...          ... 250The average casualties per ton of bombs dropped were: Killed             ...         ...         ...         ... 16Wounded         ...         ...          ...         ... 55Total ... ... ... ... 71Taking the figures for both daylight raids on London, and combining them, the average casualties per ton of bombs works out at: Killed ... ... ... .... 28Wounded ... ... ... ... 93Total ...   -     ... ... ... 121These figures are probably higher than can normally be expected, particularly in the case of the first of these two raids, during which a very high proportion of casualties occurred. This raid came as a great surprise; it was the first of its kind; the civil populace did not take cover as it should have done. This is borne-out by the fact that there were far fewer casualties per ton of bombs dropped as the result of the second daylight raid. &apos;&apos;tOn the other hand, if London were bombed in the near future, the following factors would tend to increase the ratio of casualties per ton : (i.) An exceptionally high percentage of German bombs failed to explode, (ii.) A considerable percentage of the German bombs dropped on London wereincendiary bombs and caused practically no casualties, (iii.) The explosive propensities of bombs are being considerably developed by&quot; research.(iv.) The inaccuracies of bombing are gradually being eliminated.5. Night Raids on London. German aeroplanes carried out sixteen night raids on London. All occurred between the 4th September, 1917, and the 20th May,. 1918 :-Number of aeroplanes which reached London 92Approximate tons of bombs dropped ... 21f. . .       Casualties Killed .......... ... 270Wounded ... ... ... ... 818Total ... ... ... ...        1,098
The average casualties, therefore, per ton of bombs dropped during night raids by aeroplanes on London were fifty-two per ton.As this average is arrived at as the result of sixteen raids spread over a considerable period, it may be assumed that the figures arrived at are reliable, and may be taken to be a ,f air indication of the casualties which might be expected if London was to be bombed at night in the near future. A slight increase in the proportion of casualties might be expected as the result of the factors mentioned in the latter part of paragraph 4.6. For the purposes of Staff and other exercises, it is considered that it would be fair to assume that, in densely-populated areas such as London, there will be fifty casualties per ton of bombs dropped. Of these casualties, one-third will be killed and two-thirds wounded. It is thought that, in order to ensure that results may not be obtained which will give an exaggerated idea of the destructive power of bombs, this ratio of casualties (i.e., fifty per ton) should hold good for both day and night raids. It is true that from the data available it would appear that the casualties in a daylight raid on London would be higher than in a night raid; but the evidence (only two raids) is hardly sufficient definitely to justify this assumption.When calculating the casualties that might be expected in areas less thickly populated than London, the ratio of fifty casualties per ton of bombs dropped must be proportionately reduced according to the actual density of population in the area attacked.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, May 29, 1924.SCHEDULE I.Proposed Warning System.1. The warning system may be divided into two parts : (a.) The collection of information regarding the enemy&apos;s activity; this is a Service responsibility.(b.) The distribution of the information to tne areas threatened. The issue of warnings is a Home Office responsibility, the Service authorities being responsible for transmitting the information on which any particular district is to receive the prearranged signals notifying the approach of hostile aircraft.2. Information is collected : (a.) From directional wireless and Admiralty sources.(b.) From coastal watching centres, sound mirrors working seaward and other devices on the coast.(c.) From observation zones, observation posts working through  observationcentres, as described in paragraph 3, et seg. below. (d.) From the zones in which the air defences are operating, from anti-aircraftgun and searchlight stations, and from various listening devices.3. The observation system 2 (c) above is as follows : The whole land area that is considered to be within bombing range of a possible attack is divided into observation zones. Each zone is covered by a network of observer posts, one post to every square of 6 or 7 miles side.In each zone the observer posts are connected by direct telephone to an observa-tion centre, where the courses of all hostile aircraft are plotted on a control map.4. The posts and centre are manned by an Observer Corps of Special Constables ; the organisation in each zone being under the direction of a controller. This controller would act under the authority of the Chief Constables of counties and boroughs in the matter of the provision of personnel; he would act under the authority of the G.O.C. Ground Troops in matters of technical training and in operations.5. The members of the Observer Corps to be volunteers, enrolled as Special Constables, who undertake to carry out the observer work as a part of their con-stabulary duties. In some cases they may be enrolled for observer work only, and without acceptance of the general responsibilities of the Special Constabulary.[13297.1 G
The duties would be local, and members would incur no liability to carry out the observation work at a distance from their: homes. In fact the scheme depends on their living within easy reach Of their respective posts and centres.6. The observation centres, of which, in present and near future conditions, there may be eighteen or twenty, would be connected by direct telephone lines to Fighting Area Headquarters and would transmit to the Headquarters control map courses of enemy aircraft.For all communications existing Post Office lines will be used, the only construc-tion work required being the wiring of the Centres, and short extensions from local post offices to the actual observer posts in the open.7. After a preliminary experiment in 1924, two zones have been organised in 1925. Zone No. 1, the whole of Kent, with 27 posts and a centre in Maidstone; Zone No.-2, East and West Sussex, with 16 posts, and a centre in Horsham.Tests, by.clay and night, with the co-operation of three squadrons of the R.A.F., were carried out in June 1925. During the later tests the system was worked in with the coastal watching organisation and with a partial lay-out of Fighting Area Head-quarters. .The work in the two zones was very successful; a large number of simultaneous courses, many of a complicated nature, have been accurately and rapidly plotted on the control maps.The special constables, who were carefully selected by the Chief Constables, proved very keen and efficient at the work.8. It is now proposed to give the Observer Corps a permanent standing, so that the system may be brought into action at short notice, either for practice or in an emergency.It is further proposed in 1926 to organise observation zones in Hampshire and the Eastern Counties ; when this is done, the more likely lines of approach on London itself will be covered.As soon as each zone has been organised and has received-the necessary initial instruction, it is intended to hand it over to the Zone Controller, as outlined above (in paragraph 4). ...Distribution of Information. a9. The Commander at Fighting Area Headquarters, from the courses of enemy aircraft that appear on his control map, issues information to the Trunks Manager.In principle, Fighting Area Headquarters inform the Home Office, who then issue warnings ; in practice this would be too slow, and the best method appears to be that pursued at the end of the late war the Trunks Manager to act as the representative of the Home Office and to distribute warnings according to prearranged Home Office lists. . .10. The country will be divided into numbered warning districts, and the size of these districts should depend on the efficiency that can be attained in collecting information. -If the intelligence system attains high speed and accuracy, the warning districts can be reduced in size and unnecessary disturbance can be reduced to a minimum.11. The form of messages from Fighting Area Headquarters to the Trunks Manager might follow the system which worked well at the end of the last war.Taking, say, Warning Area 48 as an example, the first intimation, a preliminary warning, would go to the Trunks Manager in the form &quot; Green 48.&quot; &quot; Green 48 would mean that hostile aircraft, in a certain force, are in such a position that they may attack Area 48. The consequent warnings would be issued by the Trunks Manager to the limited list of authorities who require preliminary notice to enable them to make the necessary preparations.Some J5 or 20 minutes later the enemy aircraft approach Area 48 and attack appears imminent, Fighting Area Headquarters issues &quot; Red 48&quot; to the Trunks Manager, who sends out the warning to the more widely distributed list, as mentioned in paragraph 50 of the Report and in Schedule III.

SCHEDULE TIT.Tabular Statement of Departmental Responsibilities.Notes.1. The following schedule shows the schemes required to be drawn up by each Department and certain Committees against possible contingencies which may arise in the event of hostile air attack against this country.2. In drafting schemes Departments should consider London separately from the rest of the country, and the possible effects on the Provinces of the conditions likely to obtain in London should be borne in mind.3.

Means of maintaining the machinery of distribution in London and other objectives of hostile air attack, (ii.) Provision of necessary supplies to areas congested by the iniiux of large numbers of refugees.XVI.- Committee for Co-ordination of Departmental Action on the Outbreak of War.Classification of Departments for the purpose of determining the order of priority in which Government offices in London shall be vacated in the event of partial removal becoming necessary.XVII. War Emergency Legislative Committee.Drafting of regulations rendered necessary by Departmental schemes in connection with Air Raid Precautions.XVIII. Air Raids Precautions Standing Committee.Examination of all Departmental schemes when completed to ensure that all contingencies, which have, or can be, foreseen, have been provided against, and that all proposals are co-ordinated into a single general plan.SCHEDULE IV.Categories of Personnel required to operate Various Schemes in connectionwith Air Raid Precautions.^The investigations of the Air Raids Precautions Committee have established the fact that there will be quite an appreciable number of individuals, who, in the event of aerial bombardment, will be required to augment existing services and to operate additional emergency services in order to ensure the maintenance of the nation&apos;s vital activities.Until the various Departments have been able to work out their schemes in some detail, it is not possible to estimate even roughly the numbers of individuals of the various trades and qualifications involved.In order, however, that the Man-Power Committee might be advised as early as possible of the classes of Labour likely to be demanded, below is given a list of these classes.It is suggested that, since air attack can be delivered in its greatest intensity immediately on the outbreak of hostilities, absolute priority in regard to personnel will need to be granted to the services included in the attached list in the first instance. Later on it might be found possible to release men for other services, when experience of actual conditions has been gained.Ambulance Services.Civilian casualties on a large scale must be provided for. The existing ambulance services will certainly need to be strengthened. Casualties will need to-be evacuated out of the area of bombardment.
-Canal and River Transport.Development of this form of transport may be necessitated owing to interruption -of rail and road traffic. In the event of heavy gas attacks, traffic by water may be the most easily maintained.Electric Light Rower Services.Damage to power stations and to supply cables must be anticipated. Personnel for effecting repairs will be required.lire Brigades.The numbers normally serving in Fire Brigades in the area of bombardment will probably need to be augmented. The creation of a reserve is under consideration by the Home Office.6&quot;as Supplies.London&apos;&quot;s gas supplies are mainly dependent on two large gas works. Personnel will be necessary to carry out repairs to plant and to gas mains.Hospital Arrangements.Demands for medical treatment and nursing will not be confined to combatant personnel. Greater provision than was necessary in the late war to meet civilian needs will have to be made.   First aid stations will need to be established.Police.Owing to the additional responsibilities which will be thrown upon the Police, there is no possibility of any reduction in the numbers normally serving within the area of bombardment. Rather it is likely that these numbers will need to be increased by drawing on the Police Forces in more remote areas.Further, it is contemplated that special constables will be employed on specific duties in connection with hostile air raids. These will also need to be exempt from liability for other Service.Rost, Telegraph and Telephone.Additional work will be thrown on the Telephone system and the chances of damage to exchanges and wires must be anticipated. Repair personnel will probably need to be augmented.Railway Transport.In the event of the London Docks being put out of action, additional demands will be made on the railways for conveyance of necessities from other ports to the Metropolis. Damage to railway lines and stations^must be anticipated and additional work thus be thrown on breakdown gangs.Road Repairs.Damage to roads in and around London will be inevitable.   The Ministry ofTransport is considering schemes for effecting repairs and clearing debris.Road Transport.The possibility of interruption to railway traffic in and around London must be accepted, and therefore additional demands might arise for road transport. The Ministry of Transport is engaged on working out schemes for the creation of a road transport service should the need arise.Street Washers.Decontamination after gas attack will in all probability involve some such method as the washing of streets and &quot; hosing down &quot; of buildings. Personnel for this purpose will have to have had some preliminary training in the use of anti-gas appliances, and will not be available for other purposes.Water Supplies.Damage to water mains will be likely. Skilled and other labour will be required to effect repairs and maintain supplies.o
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]9Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  May 1925.SECRET.Copy No.    9j.134-A.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL   DEFENCE.PROTECTION OF CIVIL POPULATION AGAINST GAS ATTACK.I AM commanded by the Army Council to forward to you the Report of the Chemical Warfare Committee on &quot; The Protection of the Civil Population against Gas Attack&apos;1 (reference C.I.D. Papers 497-B and Minutes of the 187th Meeting, held on the 28th July, 1924).Appended is a summary of the contents and conclusions of this report, with which the Army Council is in general technical agreement :--Section I. Possible Forms of Attack.This deals with the possible dangers of gas attack from the air and reviews the risks to be anticipated from the gases at present available. The conclusion reached is that mustard gas used in bombs or sprayed from aircraft would probably constitute a more serious menace than high explosive bombs, and that the worst combination of all might be the use of mustard gas and high explosive bombs in conjunction. The only chance of defeating an attack of this type lies in effective counter-measures, including anti-aircraft defence and anti-gas protective schemes.Section II. Discussion of the Precautionary Measures to be taken against AttacksThis Section outlines the general measures which are recommended for protecting the civil population. Briefly, these consist in arranging that the populace should stay indoors in protected rooms during the attack, and that special squads should be arranged to clear any areas of gas. The following is a summary of the main recommendations in this Section : (1.) That a stock of mustard gas bombs and a means for their immediate use as-a retaliatory measure should be maintained in peace time. (2.) That in view of the danger from a gas bombing attack, every effort shouldbe made to perfect our defensive measures against aircraft. (3.) That the elementary principles  of  protection  against gas should bedisseminated, as far as practicable, in peace time. (4.) That preparations be made in peace to issue on the outbreak of war specificinstructions as to the proper precautions to be taken by civilians in agas raid.(5.) That the principal measure of protection consists in going indoors and remaining there until the all clear signal has been given. (6.) That the protection of rooms against gas be arranged for in all houses,offices and business premises on the outbreak of war; people remaining in these will be practically safe. (7.) That more elaborate arrangements for the protection of rooms against gasmay be desirable in large business premises and in some government offices before the outbreak of war.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 131-A.)on Cities.[13775]b
(8.) That public shelters should also be provided on the outbreak of war. (9.) That the various Services concerned in carrying out the requisite defensive measures should be supplied with anti-gas protection and trained in its use in peace.(10.) That there should be, if possible, two gas alarm signals, the first in the nature of a warning, and the second ordering immediate stoppage of traffic and that everyone should at once take refuge. There should also be an &quot; all clear &quot; signal.(11.) That arrangements should be made for clearing areas of gas and destroying any liquid contamination that may remain after the raid..(12.) That in cases of gross contamination, the area affected should be evacuated and barricaded off until it had been rendered safe.(13.) That treatment and decontamination centres be provided, together with the necessary ambulance arrangments.In the memorandum reasons are given which show clearly why it is impracticable to issue respirators to the whole civil population. Respirators and special protective clothing will, however, require to be issued to those members of the community who must continue to perform their duties out-of-doors, both during and immediately after an attack. Attention is also drawn to the fact that a considerable amount of experimental work requires to be done to ascertain the best methods of freeing streets, houses, &amp;c, from mustard gas and other chemical warfare agents. This experimental work is now being put in hand.Section III. Organisation of the Protective Services.This Section suggests an organisation by which the arrangements indicated in Section II can be carried out. This organisation will be controlled, where possible, by a central military authority, and will involve the Police, Fire Brigade, Street Cleansing and other Municipal Services, the Ambulance Corps and Voluntary First Aid Societies. The necessity for the issue of anti-gas appliances to certain of these services in peace, and for instruction in their use, is emphasised.I am, &amp;c.H. J.

SECRET.CHEMICAL WARFARE  COMMITTEE.MEMORANDUM ON THE PROTECTION OF THE CIVIL POPULATIONAGAINST GAS ATTACK.Section I. Possible Forms of Attack. 1. General.Gas attacks on the civilian population may be incidental to attacks on military objectives, or they may quite conceivably be deliberate. The former alternative would confine them to certain regions near forts, dockyards, camps or military lines. They would be within reach of the military authority charged with the defence of the region against which the attack was aimed, and it would be within his power to do what was possible to mitigate their effect. Should the necessary measures prove beyond his scope, they would, at all events, be comprised in those which must be taken if the civil population is to be protected against deliberate gas attack.This memorandum will therefore deal with the second and vastly more important alternative, and in so doing will cover the first and lesser alternative as well.A belligerent who, as in the past, has adopted the policy of attack on the civilian population, and . who does not exclude poison gas from his range of legitimate weapons, has but to take a%hort step in order to combine the two, and will doubtless do so if such combination should appear advantageous.The consideration which this Committee have given to the subject leads them to conclude that gas attacks on the civil population might, if not guarded against, have serious and far-reaching effects, and what is apparent to them is probably equally so to the military advisers of other Powers. It is probable that the belligerent would see in this mode of warfare a cheap, quick and easy way of compelling his enemy to sue for peace, and its attraction would be enormously enhanced if he knew that his attack would be unprepared for and perhaps unexpected.Here lies the essential fact which is as true of the mode of war we are con-sidering as it was of gas warfare in France;, its effects, which are terrible if unguarded against, can be very largely neutralised by proper precautions. On the vast scale on which they would be necessary, these precautions must take a long time to organise, and cannot, therefore, be left till the outbreak of war. It is for these reasons that this Committee have felt it their duty to point out the danger and to urge that an adequate defence should be created.2. Likelihood of Gas Attack at or near the &quot;Outbreak of War.There is every reason to believe that a nation intending to use gas against the civil population of his enemy will endeavour to do so as early as possible in the war, his object being to effect surprise, before effective defence can be organised, with a view to bringing the war to an early conclusion. Nearly all the effective gases can be made in peace time and stored for years, both in bulk and in shell, without sensible deterioration.We have reason to believe that France, Russia and the United States have con-siderable reserves of poison gases; we do not know how great these reserves are, but they might be largely added to without our knowledge.As regards Germany, her well-organised and highly-developed chemical industry puts her in a very favourable position for using gas in the early days of a war. Phosgene is actually being manufactured in peace on a considerable scale, and we. [13775]       &quot; &quot; b 2
are informed by the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control that there is in existence plant capable of making at least 400 tons a month. Some of the inter-mediates for other gases are made in peace time and could be rapidly converted into the desired toxic products.The position as regards mustard gas, which we feel is the gas likely to be employed with most effect against the civil population, is typical of what Germany may do in peace in order to be able to use chemical warfare methods at the beginning of a war. Ethylene chlorohydrin and thiodiglycol are intermediates in the produc-tion of mustard gas; the former is extensively used for dye-making; the latter, which represents the next stage of the manufacture of mustard gas, can be rapidly con-verted into mustard gas by a very simple process. Since the Armistice, a large number of patents for the peace-time use of thiodiglycol has been taken out in Germany, and it is not unreasonable to infer that the idea is to create a large peace-time demand for this substance. If this is assured, the manufacture of mustard gas in war is simple. Large stocks of thiodiglycol, which is quite innocuous and can be easily stored, could be converted into mustard gas in a few days&apos; time, so that in a week or so Germany could be using mustard gas from the air, provided that the necessary empty bombs or receptacles were available; this she could do, even if no stocks of the toxic substance were kept in peace.Defensiye preparations on our part must therefore be directed towards defence against an attack delivered at the very beginning of the war. It would not be sufficient to leave the organisation of the defensive measures, and of the still more important counter-offensive measures, to be undertaken when war is declared. Such a policy would, by our defencelessness, in the early stages of the war, invite attack, whereas the opposite policy of preparedness might have the effect of preventing it altogether through fear of reprisals.3. Method of Delivering Gas Attacks.It will be useful, in the first instance, to consider in outline the vehicle or means by which gas can be effectively applied in the desired locality. The known means fall into three categories, viz., by land, by sea and by air : (a.) Gas Attacks in Land Warfare.Towns in the immediate vicinity of the battle zone on land, such as might be found in our dominions with land frontiers, could be subjected to a serious bombard-ment with gas shell, but, if the range were such that the town could only be reached by high-velocity guns, the danger would be small, since the shell for these guns would be comparatively ineffective weapons for the purpose.The effective range of a toxic gas cloud released from cylinders on a big scale and under the most favourable conditions is probably about 15 miles from the point of emission. At this distance only inconvenience would be caused. It is unlikely that a dangerous concentration of the gas would be obtained at distances greater than 10 miles from the point of emission. An irritant smoke cloud released from generators on a big scale and under the most favourable conditions has a greater effective range than a toxic gas cloud, and might make itself felt to a serious degree 20 miles, and perhaps more, from the point of emission. It must, however, be remembered that the emission of gas clouds and of toxic smokes on a big scale, no less than heavy bombardments with gas shell, generally demands a stabilised battle &apos; line, since the operations involve much preliminary labour and the transport of a great quantity of material close to positions occupied by the enemy.The risk to the civil population from these methods of gas attack is on the whole not a great one,in land warfare, as it will be seen that the effective range of land weapons extends to only a limited distance from positions actually held in force by the user. When in future wars conditions have become suitable for the employment of toxic gas and smoke clouds, it is quite likely that the major part, if not the whole, of the civilian population will have been evacuated from the battle zone owing to appreciation of the danger. So far as mere terrorisation of the civilian population is concerned, it would be just as effective in mobile land warfare to shell defenceless towns with high explosive as with gas; in either case bombardment with this sole object in view would probable be waste of time. So far, then, as the deliberate attack on the civil population is concerned, the use of land weapons on any serious scale may be ruled out as highly improbable.
(b.) Gas Attacks from the Sea on Coast Towns.Attacks by sea are limited to aggregations of population in a belt along our coast line stretching as far inland as Naval guns are able to reach. In practice, however, it would be extremely unlikely that enemy warships with large calibre guns Could . afford to carry a sufficient quantity of gas shell for effective bombardment, if they must also be prepared to meet and fight our Fleet, so that, in all probability, the zone of attack must be limited to a belt which can be reached by small-calibre Naval guns, or by gas clouds which can be released from ships or generated from canisters dropped in the water. The small capacity of Naval gas shell would probably make them ineffective gas weapons for this purpose. The main danger would appear to be that a coast town or harbour might be subjected to an attack by gas or toxic smoke cloud from the sea provided that a raiding force could reach its objective without opposition and lay generators in the sea sufficiently close to the shore under favourable wind conditions. Such an attack might have as its sole object the terrorisation of the inhabitants, but it might also serve as a prelude to a rapid raid by a landing party with a view to the destruction of shipping, buildings, &amp;c. It is doubtful if such a gas attack could attain serious dimensions in the face of artillery opposition, but it could probably be achieved most easily by submarines or fast craft under cover of darkness; undefended coast towns would certainly lie open to attack in this way.&apos; This type of attack is regarded as unlikely, if we have command of the sea, except on a limited scale from submarines.The actual effects of an attack from the sea would, however, be similar to those of an attack from the air, which form the subject of the succeeding paragraphs, and they would require to be dealt with in the same way.An organisation spread all over the country and designed to minimise the effects of gas attack from the air would, ipso facto, fulfil the same function as regards attacks on coast towns delivered from the sea. For this reason, defence of coast towns against attack from the sea will not be specifically dealt with, being included in the general defence of the country against attacks by air.(c.) Gas A attacks from the Air.Whereas gas attacks by land and sea are extremely limited as to choice of objective, the case would be very different if the attack were delivered by aeroplanes, owing to the ease with which these could pass the outer defences and drop gas bombs on selected objectives well behind the battle or coast line zone. In the absence of effective anti-aircraft defences, the range of an aeroplane is only determined by its fuel capacity and the location of its base of operations. If the enemy coast line is near enough to enable his aircraft to start from his shores and return there after delivering its attack, then attacks can be on a very large scale, to be reckoned in hundreds of aeroplanes. When his coast line is too distant, his air attacks must be launched from aircraft carriers, and this limits their scale to a matter of perhaps ten to twenty aeroplanes per carrier.As we know, London and other important centres of industry in this country unfortunately lie well within aeroplane range of two at least of the greater continental Powers -the capital is indeed peculiarly vulnerable in this respect and the modern developments of aviation foreshadow the possibility of really serious raids by day or by night by large numbers of hostile aeroplanes. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that in future warfare gas attacks delivered from the air will be a far greater source of danger to the civilian population than attacks by artillery projectiles or gas or toxic smoke clouds.According to figures, communicated by the Committee on Air Raid Precautions, a daily raid by some fifty to a hundred aeroplanes carrying 50 tons of bombs does not overrate the scale of attack which might be expected and ought to be organised against. During the first 48 hours after mobilisation, this scale of attack may be doubled. Even with existing types of bombs, 50 tons total weight represents at least 10 tons of gas, and, with improved designs, the ratio of gas to total weight is likely to be considerably increased. The same is true if the spraying of gas from appro-nriate containers proves an effective proposition. No purely defensive measures could, of course, withstand an onslaught of this type for long, but, taken in conjunc-tion with the appropriate anti-aircraft defence and counter-offence, an organised defence, ought, it is hoped, to limit the effects on the civil population to well within what can be endured.
(b.) Gas A attacks from the Sea on Coast Towns.Attacks by sea are limited to aggregations of population in a belt along our coast line stretching as far inland as Naval guns are able to reach. In practice, however, it would be extremely unlikely that enemy warships with large calibre guns Could . afford to carry a sufficient quantity of gas shell for effective bombardment, if they must also be prepared to meet and fight our Fleet, so that, in all probability, the zone of attack must be limited to a belt which can be reached by small-calibre Naval guns, or by gas clouds which can be released from ships or generated from canisters dropped in the water.

For this reason, defence of coast towns against attack from the sea will not be specifically dealt with, being included in the general defence of the country against attacks by air.(c.)

4. Probable Objectives for Gas Air A attacks.A belligerent contemplating the use of gas from the air may be content to employ it in a secondary role to hamper the resources of the enemy&apos;s fighting forces. His objectives would then logically be dockyard towns, ports of embarkation of troops, docks where vessels unload and load foodstuffs and stores, factory towns, colliery districts and munition centres. The successful attack of these would undoubtedly hamper our fighting forces, especially if a large number of them were attacked in rapid succession. The isolated attack of one or two would not have a decisive effect. To achieve this object therefore a considerable dispersion of effort would be necessary, and this might be found uneconomical. Such considerations would inevitably cause an enemy to reflect on the advisability of using this weapon in a primary role, against the greatest aggregations of population, where these have the greatest influence on the counsels of the nation.It is beyond dispute that the capital answers to these two requirements. By the sudden infliction of thousands of casualties, repeated as they easily might be day after day, the nation, if without means of defence and without means of retaliation, could probably be brought to its knees. At all events, a belligerent would not be unreasonable in counting on such a result.We may therefore assume that the most probable objective will be the capital; but all large towns, thickly-populated industrial regions, ports, depots, fortifications and camps may be attacked, and the defence must embrace them all.5. Types of Gases that could be used and their Probable Effects.The objection may be raised that if large numbers of bombs are to be dropped from aeroplanes on to heavily populated areas, it would be better to employ high explosive than gas. Great material destruction and loss of life might be expected to result from the use of high explosive, and there would be the chance that an uncontrollable fire might be started which might wipe out the whole of a big industrial or commercial area. If gas is to be used at all it must offer some advantages.. In discussing this point, it will be sufficient to divide toxic gases into two classes, (a) non-persistent and (b) persistent. The significance of this classification for our purpose lies in the great difference in defence measures which the two classes demand.Non-persistent gases are either true gases at ordinary temperatures or irritant smokes; they exert all their effect within a comparatively short time of their being released, and they are soon dissipated in the atmosphere by the wind; no lasting pollution of the ground takes place and no decontamination of the area round the bomb-hole is necessary.Persistent gases, which are generally scattered in liquid form, contaminate the ground, and continue to give off harmful vapours for a long time, perhaps for days, after the attack. Thus the defence must not only provide for keeping the population safe during and immediately after the attack, but must take measures to clear the ground of the effects of contamination.A short description of the general physiological effects of typical non-persistent and persistent gases, and of the results anticipated from a gas attack in which they are employed, will suffice to indicate the extent of the danger and to render intelligible the defensive measures which will be proposed in the next section. It must not be forgotten that a gas attack may be combined with the use of high explosive bombs, and gases of different types may be used at the same time. These considerations will be borne in mind in the defence scheme, but are omitted for the sake of simplicity and clarity in the remarks which follow.(a.) Non-Persistent Gases.The extremely poisonous gas, phosgene, which was used so largely during the European war, may be taken as a type, and in this class must also be included substances such as the toxic arsenical compounds (e.g., diphenylchloroarsine, intro-cluced by the Germans in their Blue Cross shell) which, though solids, can be liberated from suitable generators as an intensely irritant toxic smoke cioud.The inhalation of even low concentrations of phosgene in the air breathed may cause acute inflammation of the lungs, which soons results in pulmonary oedema. When once pulmonary oedema has set in, the prognosis is grave, for death is quite a
ocommon sequel. The risk is extreme if a person is exposed to strong concentrations of phosgene, for a single breath or a couple of breaths of the poisonous atmosphere may then be sufficient to ensure a fatal result. The onset of symptoms of phosgene poisoning may be delayed for some hours, and this delayed action may cause subsequent deaths, unless care is taken to warn the patients against any great exertion. It is evident, therefore, that if a large phosgene bomb were to burst in a crowded street, or in the interior of an occupied building, those in the immediate vicinity of the burst would stand in the greatest danger, and it can be predicted with certainty that not only would casualties result in such a case, but in addition they would be mainly of a very severe type with a high rate of mortality. On the other hand, those who were further away from the burst of the bomb might have time to gain the shelter of intact houses, and close doors and windows before the gas-cloud was upon them. If so, they might escape altogether, for the gas-cloud would be swept away by the wind or become so diluted by air currents before it could percolate into the houses, as to&apos; be rendered practically harmless. As a rule, the gas-cloud resulting from the explosion of a bomb containing a non-persistent gas dissipates pretty quickly, but it must be acknowledged, as a result of experience in France, that such clouds may hang about in dangerous concentrations in sheltered localities for a considerable time when there is little or no breeze. On the whole, the danger ensuing from the explosion of a- phosgene bomb, great though it. may be just after the burst under favourable conditions, does not last very long; half an hour after the bombing had ceased, there would probably be little risk save in certain particularly sheltered spots, e.g\, inside a house in which a bomb had burst or in cellars or rooms into which a heavy gas-cloud had penetrated.It would be very difficult to say that the employment of phosgene bombs would result in more casualties and deaths than would the employment of an equal number of high-explosive bombs, for we have no experience which might help us to form a correct judgment. A large high-explosive bomb making a lucky hit in a crowded street or occupied house would probably kill or injure just as many people, with the added advantage of causing damage to adjacent buildings, which might increase the casualty roll still more. In any case, no really great effect would be anticipated from phosgene bombs unless these were dropped in great numbers, so that a heavy weight of gas was suddenly developed on the target before the inhabitants of the town had warning and could seek the comparative shelter of houses in which there would be some hope of safety. In a town, streets and open spaces occupy a larger area than do the houses, and would therefore receive the majority of the bombs.It is still more difficult to forecast the probable effect on the inhabitants of a town of irritant smoke clouds liberated from generators dropped by aeroplanes, for an efficient generator has not yet been designed, though the general properties of these clouds are well known from experience with generators on land: If an effective aeroplane attack of this type were to be made on a thickly populated centre, one can conceive that it might result in widespread consternation and panic. In this case it is not serious injury or death that has to be feared, for it- is difficult, if not impossible, to attain the requisite concentration of the solid toxic substances in the air, when dispersed as smokes. What does count is the violent irritant action that substances of the type of diphenylchloroarsine exert on the nose, throat and respiratory passages when they are present in the particulate form in the air breathed even at astoundingly low concentration. A concentration of about one part of this arsenic compound in 100 million parts of air can only just be tolerated by an unprotected person for about ten minutes. The pain, distress and utter misery experienced by a person who breathes such an atmosphere may drive him well-nigh distracted. Yet these symptoms do not last for any great length of time after the affected man has withdrawn from the poisonous atmosphere to fresh air; they may continue to increase in severity for a short time, but soon they begin slowly to subside, and after the lapse of an hour or two there may be little amiss with the person. These toxic smokes would be dissipated by the wind and eddy currents in the same way as a phosgene cloud.(b.) Persistent Gases.In point of fact, these are liquids of high boiling point which evaporate extremely slowly, giving rise to a vapour which is excessively irritant or toxic, even though it is present in the air in very low concentrations. Ground contaminated by such liquids continues to give off a toxic vapour for days. Two types may be considered : (i) a &quot; lachrymator&apos;&quot; such as the ethyl iodoacetate used by the
British during the war, and (ii) the &quot;vesicant&quot; mustard gas (dichlorodiethyl sulphide) introduced by the Germans. Another gas of the latter type is the much talked of American Lewisite. A lachrymator causes immediate and intense smarting and watering of the eyes, and some irritation of the respiratory organs, though the latter effect is not as a rule dangerous. If a heavily populated area were contaminated with lachrymator liquid by means of aeroplane bombs, the immediate effect would be extremely unpleasant and disconcerting. The traffic would be thrown into confusion and practically everyone in the area would suffer the characteristic eye symptoms. Yet if once the area could be evacuated of its inhabitants a proceeding which would admittedly be by no means easy if the degree of contamination were heavy no further danger would arise. , It is true that no person would be able subsequently to enter the area without wearing a respirator until the liquid had been dissipated by evaporation which might take many hours-but if any unprotected person approached it inadvertently, he would at once get warning of his danger by the onset of smarting of the eyes and lachrymation. At first sight it would seem that a lachrymator would be an excellent thing to use to cause disorganisation of industry and business. It certainly would; yet for this purpose, there is a far better agent, viz., mustard gas.A possible reason for using a lachrymator might lie in its non-lethal character, that is, it might be used on humanitarian grounds, hoping to attain a military object without taking life, but, apart from this, its use in a determined gas bombing raid seems unlikely, since its results, though serious, would be so much less so than those produced by mustard gas. There is, of course, the possibility that lachrymafcor and mustard gas might be employed together against an unsuspecting town, as the lachrymator would prevent people getting quickly out of the area and might thus increase the number of casualties from mustard gas.Mustard gas is a liquid which has only a slight odour an odour to which the sense of smell quickly tires, so that a person breathing air containing mustard gas vapour soon becomes quite oblivious of the smell, and herein lies a great danger. The substance is a violent poison, but unlike the other poisons that have been mentioned above, its action is delayed, and an hour or two may elapse after exposure before obvious symptoms begin to show themselves. This is one of the greatest dangers with mustard gas, as there is nothing to warn an individual that he has come into contact with the gas except the slight smell of its vapour until the symptoms begin to appear several hours later. In spite of the delay, the effects may be of the most serious character and sufficient to cause death.Exposure to the vapour causes painful and severe inflammation of the eyes, and inflammation of the respiratory tract which manifests itself in the mildest cases by laryngitis and loss of voice, and in the more severe cases by bronchitis which may develop into broncho-pneumonia of a very serious type. During the war practically every fatal case of mustard gas poisoning was attributable to this broncho-pneumonia. Some degree of inflammation of the skin of the body is frequently seen after exposure to air containing even small concentrations of the vapour, and after exposure to strong concentrations of the vapour actual blistering may occur. . Severe inflammation and blistering of the skin is caused if the person or his clothing is splashed by droplets of liquid mustard gas or comes into contact with objects contaminated even to a small degree with the actual liquid. Mustard gas may easily penetrate the clothing if a person sits on contaminated ground or leans against a wall or other object which has been lightly sprayed with mustard gas. In the case of heavily contaminated ground, mustard gas may even penetrate through the boots and cause blistering of the feet. Moreover, persons whose clothing has been contaminated with mustard gas constitute a very serious source of danger if they enter rooms, railway carriages, or omnibuses occupied by other persons, for their clothing will continue to give off a poisonous vapour, particularly in a warm environment. One person may thus unwittingly distribute the poison to a number of others.Exposure to mustard gas is followed usually by some degree of inflammation of the eyes. Blistering may or may not be common amongst the casualties, for the liability to blistering will depend upon the heaviness with which the area has been contaminated, and upon the degree to which the person has been exposed to danger, and the same may be said of the liability to severe respiratory trouble. It must, however, be remembered that even relatively slight inflammation of the eyes and blistering of the skin in mild degree may be enough to prevent a person from following his ordinary occupation for a few days, and perhaps for a week or two. The blisters require medical treatment as they are very liable to septic infection. ,
It is impossible to forecast with certainty what proportion of the inhabitants of a thickly populated area would be affected by the poison, if the area were subjected to really heavy bombing with mustard gas in an air raid. Some idea of the potentialities of mustard gas can, however, be gained from the following three instances which occurred during the war, and show the serious results of bombard-men ts with mustard gas shell when directed upon untrained civilians or troops lacking proper anti-gas discipline.(i.) The mustard gas bombardment of Armentieres on the 28th-29th July, 1917, caused 675 gas casualties amongst the remnant of the civilian population that still continued to inhabit the outskirts of the town, and eighty-six of these casualties died. The people were unable to leave the shelter of cellars during the bombardment, and were loath to forsake their homes and property when it was over.(ii.) The average mortality of mustard gas casualties occurring amongst British troops in France was under 3 per cent., and one may regard the troops as a whole as being well disciplined in anti-gas protection. On one occasion, however, mustard gas shelling caused exceptionally heavy gas casualties in two batteries; indeed, one of the batteries lost practically the whole of its personnel from this cause. This was due solely to the fact that every precaution was neglected, and the mortality amongst the casualties reached the appalling figures of 51 per cent, and 58 per cent, respectively.(iii.) The village of Fonquevillers was heavily shelled with mustard gas on the llth-12th May, 1918. Troops were very casual about wearing their respirators, sleeping men were not aroused sufficiently quickly, and billets were not evacuated soon enough. The consequence was that rather more than 2,000 gas casualties were caused amongst troops billeted in the village or passing through it, and the mortality amongst these casualties was 9 per cent. The number of gas casualties represents a large proportion of the troops actually exposed to gas.In view of these figures, it can be predicted with certainty that a heavy bombardment with mustard gas by aeroplanes would result in a very large number of casualties in thickly-populated districts, such as occur in London or other large towns. Stress is laid on the fact that the bombardment must be a really heavy one. A few isolated gas bombs dropped at random in a town could not be expected to produce much effect. What is required is to drop a large number of bombs within a limited area. Progressive developments in air navigation and accurate bomb dropping, which we may fairly anticipate, render it certain that we shall have to face this situation in the future. If we consider the scale of attack mentioned in a previous paragraph, viz., 50 tons of bombs a day, and assume that 20-lb. bombs are used, then an equal distribution of the bombs over an area three miles square would apportion one bomb to each square having a side of about 70 yards. There would be 5,600 centres of contamination, and each bomb which burst in the street would spread the toxic liquid over an area of about 300 square yards at least. An area of three miles square in the heart of London might contain about a million people by day and about half this number by night. -If the gas were carried in tanks and released in the form of a liquid spray which would settle to the ground, a much more even distribution would be obtained and a much larger area could be contaminated. For weight carried, there would be more mustard gas than in the case of bombs, but there would be a loss of liquid due to evaporation in falling through the air. It has hot yet been definitely established, however, whether spraying or bombing is the more effective method of using mustard gas from the air.In the event of an air raid of this description taking place, what would be the peculiar merits of mustard gas ? If high explosive alone were used, casualties and damage to property (in the absence of a widespread conflagration) would, practically speaking, be limited to the actual brief period of the raid. The casualty list and the death roll might be extremely heavy, but after the raid was over the survivors would be in little danger; unsafe buildings could be avoided, and traffic diverted from blocked streets to adjacent ones that would be perfectly safe. If the bombs contained merely a simple lachrymator, the violent effect on the eyes would render the area intolerable, and the great risk would be that a wild and disastrous stampede would take place as the inhabitants tried to escape from the poisoned locality. Mustard gas is, however, more subtle in its action.[13775] c   :.
Phosgene, toxic smoke clouds and ordinary lachrymators all advertise their presence by the immediate irritant effects that they produce; mustard gas does not. Mustard gas bombs would probably contain but a small explosive charge, just sufficient to open the bomb and dispel the contents in the form of a fine spray or mist, and doubtless there would be heavy contamination with liquid mustard gas in the neighbourhood of the burst. Except when houses were struck and penetrated by a bomb, the damage to buildings would be comparatively slight. The material damage would be even less if the mustard gas was rained on the area from tanks carried in the aircraft. After the first shock of alarm had passed, the inhabitants, if uninstructed as regards gas attacks, would very likely congratulate themselves on the small damage that had been done, and would go about their affairs completely unconscious of the danger in which they stood. The air might smell, perhaps quite strongly, of mustard or garlic, but that would not signify anything special to them; the eyes would not smart or water, nor would there be any irritation of the throat or respiratory organs. People would walk through the contaminated areas and would not only infect themselves but would also carry the toxic liquid on their clothes to their homes and Offices, thus in many cases affecting other people. An hour or so later, the real effects of the poison would begin to show themselves, and soon casualties would be occurring in large numbers, and panic would set in. Under conditions of unpreparedness, it is quite conceivable that if the population moved about in the contaminated area, a quarter of them might be expected to show subsequent signs of contamination and they might infect a large number of persons. By giving warning, however, and by the observation of a few simple precautions, e.g., by staying indoors until the &quot; all clear &quot; was given, it would be possible to reduce enormously the number of persons affected.If we suppose that the population has been evacuated from the area, the question still arises as to how the situation is to be dealt with. Damage caused by high explosive lies patent to the eye, but even those who are thoroughly conversant with mustard gas and its properties would have the greatest difficulty in determining the full extent of contamination in the area. When a contaminated spot has been identified, the eradication of mustard gas by artificial means is no easy task, and the problem would be a particularly awkward one if the poison had penetrated into buildings. The disappearance of mustard gas by natural evaporation is a very slow process and may take many days. The Germans recognised, this when they submitted Armentieres to heavy mustard gas shelling as a prelude to their offensive on the Lys front in April 1918, for they issued orders that none of their troops were to enter the town until a fortnight had elapsed after its capture. Clearly the population could not be readmitted to the area until the place had been freed from poison; indeed the recollection of the casualties that resulted on the day of the raid would probably deter them from returning, unless1 safety could be guaranteed. Meanwhile the whole of the business and industries of the gassed area would be at a standstill.One very serious aspect remains to be considered, viz., the effect of a gas bombing raid on London during a thick fog. Under these conditions, when the air is stagnant, the gas will persist in serious concentration for a long time and all defensive schemes would be disorganised by the fog. The consequences of this might be disastrous. The situation is made all the more serious by the fact that enemy meteorologists in Western Europe could in the majority of cases forecast with accuracy when fog conditions existed over London and the enemy could make use of the information. The fog may be low-lying and leave&apos;sufficient landmarks visible for the guidance of bombing aeroplanes; at the same time this will seriously hamper our anti-aircraft defence within the area, and make it difficult for our defensive planes to leave the ground.6. Summary.If we admit that a really heavy aeroplane raid is not an idle dream, but a genuine danger of the future, we may feel some doubts as to the relative value of, phosgene bombs as opposed to high explosive, and be uncertain in our present state of knowledge as to the efficiency of toxic smoke generators dropped from the air, but we cannot deny that disastrous results might easily ensue if mustard gas were used. Quite apart from the physical damage, the moral effect of such an attack would undoubtedly be serious. Mustard gas bombs, with a certain number of high explosive bombs in addition, might form the worst combination of all, since the widespread breaking of windows from the concussion due to the explosions would assist the poisonous vapour and spray to gain access to the interior of buildings.
The only chance of defeating an attack of this type lies in effective counter-measures, including anti-aircraft defence and anti-gas protective schemes. We see that the use of persistent gas involves the decontamination of the areas infected before the populace can be safe, an operation which is not required in the case of non-persistent agents.. As the steps for dealing with persistent gases will also cover the non-persistent, the precautions and measures suggested in the subsequent sections are framed for dealing with persistent gases.Section II. Discussion of the Precautionary Measures to be taken againstGas Attacks on Cities.1. General.The measures which can be taken against a gas attack on a. city are (A.) Offensive. (B.) Defensive.(A.)2. Offensive Measures.Retaliatory bombing of enemy cities is perhaps the most effective of all measures, for if we are known to be in a state of readiness equal, or nearly equal, to that of the enemy, it is very possible that he will be restrained from gas attack on our towns by the knowledge of the retribution which he will thereby bring on his own.To be ready for an emergency it will be necessary to maintain in time of peace, stocks of filled bombs, and bombing planes, and an organisation for using them.The Committee consider that mustard gas would form the most effective filling, but no stocks of mustard gas are held in this country at present. Moreover, our process for making it is still in the experimental stage, and a con-siderable time must elapse before it becomes established on a manufacturing basis. Up to the present the policy of the Government has not allowed us to instal any plant other than that necessary to produce the small quantities of gas required for experimental purposes in peace.The process used by the Germans, though admirably suited to their existing plant and normal commercial output, could not be installed in this country without very heavy financial charges.The process used by us during the war never reached a stage of freedom from casualties such that it could be justifiably worked in peace time, but it is hoped that the process now under development will provide a satisfactory solution of the problem.Our immunity against gas attack would be very greatly increased were we permitted to build up a reserve stock of mustard gas, on which we could fall back for retaliatory purposes, if necessary, until the arrangements made for bulk produc-tion became effective and a steady output was assured. It is estimated that at the present moment at least three months would be required for this. The possession of a stock of several hundred tons of mustard gas would allow us to retaliate as soon as the liquid could be filled into bombs; this might mean a delay of at least a fortnight. If the gas was kept ready in bombs, immediate retaliation would be possible if the necessary aeroplanes were available.The accumulation of a stock of this substance, preferably in bombs, is, there-fore, a step which the Committee strongly recommend, and regard as the most effective and important measure which can be taken at the present time, to safeguard this country, and especially its capital, against gas attack.(B.)3. Defensive Measures. Attach on Enemy Bombing SquadronsAttack on enemy bombing planes only concerns this Committee in so far as enemy bombing planes carrying gas and brought down by our aeroplanes, would contaminate the places where they fell. Such isolated spots of gross contamination could probably best be dealt with by the Military force engaged in the defence of London or the district involved. The fallen aircraft would have to be isolated and experts would then proceed to ascertain the nature of the toxic chemicals and destroy them at leisure. In view of the difficulties of perfecting an anti-gas organisation [13775] &quot; D
for the protection of the civil population, the Committee take this opportunity of emphasising the paramount importance of anti-aircraft defence.4. Anti-gas Protective Measures for the Civil Population.Measures for protecting the civil population against gas are necessary, since nothing can ensure that a proportion at least of the attacking aeroplanes will not reach their objective; if such measures can be made reasonably efficient, they will very greatly reduce the number and severity of the casualties.In addition, the mere fact that protective measures have been organised will constitute a deterrent to attack by gas, because the enemy will have to reckon that the effect of his attack will be incomparably smaller than if it were delivered against an unorganised and undefended city.   These measures should comprise : (1.) The dissemination of knowledge concerning the effects of a gas attack andthe precautionary measures. (2.) The provision of an air-raid alarm.(3.) The provision of shelters in which the inhabitants of a city can obtainprotection, during and subsequent to an attack. (4.) The organisation of a Service for clearing an area of gas. (5.) The organisation of a Service for dealing with casualties and personscontaminated, or suspected of being contaminated. (6.) Military control of this organisation.5. The Dissemination of Knowledge..1N othing could more effectively aid a gas attack than complete ignorance on the part of the populace of its mode of action and especially of its limitations.If immediate panic were to result from a gas bombing raid, no protective organisation could be of the slightest avail, and the first essential is, therefore, that everyone should know what he is expected to do in the circumstances, and that if he does it he will be comparatively safe. The following knowledge should be in the possession of every civilian of an age rendering him or her capable of taking responsible action : -(a.) That in a gas attack, it is dangerous to be out of doors; comparative safety lies in going indoors and closing the doors and windows, and almost complete safety in making his room practically gas tight.(b.) That an insidious and extremely probable form of gas attack consists in showering down, either in drops or in bombs, a poisonous liquid which evaporates slowly and continues to give off poisonous gas for days, until the liquid has either been washed away by water or destroyed by chemicals. Consequently, when a gas attack has started in his vicinity, he must remain indoors, until the neighbourhood has been cleared up by the authorities, and civilians can safely proceed with their normal vocations.(c.) That both the liquid and the vapour may, if given the opportunity, damage him not only by poisoning him through breathing, but by action on his eyes, and on the whole of his body, even through his clothes.(d.) That the effects of gassing will possibly be delayed for some hours and that, in consequence, a person who is exposed to a source of contamination may be affected sufficiently to become a casualty without knowing it.(e.) That a contaminated person can, and probably will, communicate contamination to other persons in a confined space, or from his hands to any other parts of his body which he may touch.(/.) That any person who has reason to think he is contaminated with gas, whether from bomb or spray, should change his clothes and have a bath as soon as possible.The above ideas are broad generalisations dealing with the effects of, and precautions against, gas attack, and probably of sufficient general interest to admit of their becoming widely known to the ordinary run of intelligent people.Admittedly it would be a great advantage if the public were already acquainted with the foregoing information before the outbreak of war, but the Committee see great difficulties in educating them along these lines in peace time. The orly means by which information could be propagated directly would be by
inspired articles in the Press, or by incorporating the information in educational courses in elementary hygiene, &amp;c. Efforts of this kind might be misconstrued and might arouse political feeling or international distrust, thus defeating the object in view. We have an example of this in the propaganda in favour, of Chemical Warfare which was carried on in &quot;the U.S.A. in 1920 and 1921, which resulted in strong pressure being brought on the American Government to introduce clauses forbidding its use into the terms of the Washington Agreement. Instruction of the territorial force and of certain public bodies (and possibly voluntary aid societies) in anti-gas defence would tend gradually to disseminate information throughout the country.On the outbreak of war, or when deemed necessary by the Government, this information, together with concise instructions as to the action to be taken in the event of an air raid, could be promptly brought to the notice of the civilian popula-tion through the agency of the Press, or it might be possible to broadcast it by wireless. It is imperative that there should be no delay in spreading the information on the outbreak of war, and for this reason the requisite notices and official posters must obviously be drafted in peace time and sufficient copies kept ready for immediate issue to the proper quarters.More detailed information and instructions must be issued to the authorities upon whom the responsibility will rest for organising and carrying out anti-gas schemes locally. In this case, it would be too late to wait for the outbreak of war before issuing the&apos; information; it should be available long before there is any thought of war, so that plans may be developed in detail to suit local conditions and resources. The authorities to whom such detailed information might have to be communicated include the following : (1.) Municipal Authorities.It is suggested that the organisation of the necessary services to deal with the protection of the civil population against gas attack should be undertaken by the London County Council in the case of London, by the County Borough Councils in the case of large towns of 50,000 inhabitants and above, and by the County Councils, operating through their subordinate town and district councils, in the case of the remainder of the country.Such municipal services as the Police, Special Constabulary, Eire Brigade, Street-Washing Corps and Ambulance Service are well adapted to undertake definite duties in connection with anti-gas organisation, but it would be necessary for them to have training beforehand if they are to be relied upon in an emergency.(2.) The Medical Profession.In addition to instructions regarding the organisation for dealing with gas casualties, concise information would have to be communicated to .. medical practitioners regarding the symptoms and treatment of the different forms of gas poisoning. A pamphlet on the latter subject is at present being prepared by the Committee. This is intended primarily for the use of Medical Officers in His Majesty&apos;s Services, but a sufficient stock could be kept so that a copy could be issued to every medical man in the country on&apos; the outbreak of war.(3.) Voluntary Aid Societies.These might give invaluable aid provided they had some acquaintance with the subject. The Committee is uncertain whether the courses of instruction at present given to members of these Societies include any reference to ambulance work in warfare; if this is so, it should not be a difficult matter to add sufficient information regarding gas casualties and anti-gas defence. Members of the Voluntary Aid Societies would then be in a position to make house-to-house visits on the outbreak of war, explaining the various precautions that must be taken and the reasons fo obeying the official instructions.The functions and disposition of all these Voluntary Aid Societies should be carefully considered with a view to deciding what part each might play in the organisation.6. Provision of an Air Raid Alarm.,As it will be impossible to say whether in any impending air raid gas will or will not be used, only one system of giving the alarm can he adopted.   It is under-stood that the Air Raids Sub-Committee has already considered the question of [13775] - &apos; d 2
alarms very fully with a view to producing the least possible dislocation of the normal activities of the district concerned. From the gas point of view, the ideal scheme would be to have two very definite and distinct alarm signals for big attacks. The first would be a warning repeated all over the city that an attack was approaching. It would, perhaps, be possible to give this anything up to half an hour before the bombing commenced. Traffic would not be stopped on this signal, and it would give people time to get to their protected rooms or homes, and would admit of a large number of vehicles getting away and leaving the streets clear. Tubes, &apos;buses and trains would continue to run until the second alarm, which should be of an unmistakably different character, and on which all traffic must cease and all persons still in the street must seek shelter. Vehicles should as far as possible be parked in side-streets, so as to leave the main roads clear. It would be desirable to advise the populace that the second alarm may follow a few minutes after the first, and that they should not make a rush for the tubes, but proceed quietly to their protected rooms. If, however, a double warning is impracticable, as it probably is, the only suggestion which this Committee would submit for consideration is the necessity of giving, if possible, at least 10 minutes&apos; notice in the case of large attacks, to give the populace time to get to their protected rooms or the public shelters. People would then be informed that this alarm meant that an attack was imminent and that they should at once seek shelter, vehicles to be parked, where possible, in side-streets, leaving the main roads clear.7. The Provision of Shelter during and subsequent to a Gas Attack.It has often been suggested that the best protection for the civil population against gas attack would consist in supplying each individual with a gas mask, sometimes called a respirator. Reflection shows, however, that this is impracticable. Gas masks do not protect the body against the effects of mustard gas, although they do protect the eyes and lungs against it. Gas masks require to be carefully fitted, and, for them to be effective, the wearer must be trained and accustomed to their use. Untrained persons wearing them for the first time in an emergency are liable to feet suffocated, and may derive more harm than good from them. Infants cannot wear respirators.Respirators produced by private firms could not be depended upon to be effective unless made to a definite specification sanctioned by the Government. For these reasons, quite apart from the problem of manufacturing the millions that would be required, the use of respirators by the civil population must be ruled out. Further, it should be clearly laid down that firms are not to undertake the supply of respirators without Government sanction, otherwise many people might attempt to obtain respirators privately, and, apart from the objection raised in the preceding paragraph, this would perhaps have the serious consequences of using up components and materials otherwise urgently required for the production of the protective appliances essential for the Fighting Services, and for the municipal and other personnel who have to take an active part in the scheme of defence. Instructions will be given in the Official Notices as to how home-made devices might be made to give a low degree of temporary protection in a special emergency.The main line of defence recommended for the civil population as a whole is that the people should go indoors and stay there, thus making use of the existing shelter in the shape of buildings, to keep out of the reach of the gas which may be supposed to be permeating the streets and open spaces. This measure alone, if universally adopted, could be relied on to reduce very greatly the number of casualties to be expected.The concentration of gas in the atmosphere, in the streets and open spaces, is not expected to remain high for long, except when there is no wind, and rooms, the doors and windows of which have been closed and in which the fires have been extinguished, will only become polluted by the process of diffusion, which is a slow one, so that by the time the concentration in the rooms approximates to that in the outer air, this latter may be expected to have dropped to a more or less innocuous figure.If we go a step further, and, selecting certain suitable rooms in every house, collect the personnel of the house therein, and induce them to seal up all cracks and openings, including the chimneys, with any convenient means, and remain there quietly, the diffusion will be reduced to negligible proportions, and, apart from direct hits, the personnel may be regarded as quite safe. We believe that the sealing&apos; up of rooms to be approximately gas tight is a practicable proposition which, with
very little instruction, could be put into effect by anyone. Experiments to ascertain exactly the most practical way in which this can be done are now in progress at Porton, and the necessary instructions can be inserted in the official posters and notices when these are drafted. It is true that the rooms will never be really gas tight, even the walls themselves (unless lined with metal) being permeable, but the degree of permeability will, we think, be negligible for the purpose in view. Rooms and buildings treated in this way will be described throughout this document as protected.A question arises as regards chimneys, which, communicating as they do with the upper, and presumably unpolluted, air, might possible be allowed to remain open, thus admitting of diffusion of fresh air into&quot; the room, and therefore of a smaller air space per person. But unless a room is in other respects perfectly sealed, chimneys will be liable to cause a draught, tending to draw into the room the very air which it is desired to exclude. It is, therefore, considered safer that all chimneys should be blocked. It goes without saying that all coal or gas fires must be extinguished; as it is difficult to do this quickly, a room should be selected in which a fire is not likely to be burning in the event of emergency.Assuming, as an outside figure, that twelve hours is the time necessary for clearing up the contaminated streets after a mustard gas attack, it follows that the number of persons allotted per room must be such as to allow sufficient air space to enable them to remain there for that time. 300 cubic feet per person is considered sufficient for this purpose. The necessity for providing food and sanitary conveniences should not be overlooked.In large buildings it will probably be practicable for a suite of rooms to be protected, opening off each other, or off a common corridor, which should also be sealed.Even more elaborate arrangements would be necessary in the case of Government offices which cannot afford to cease work during and after a gas raid. Telephone exchanges come under this category.The question&apos;as to the part of the house in which the rooms are to be selected as gas shelters must be considered in connection with high explosive bombing. Assuming that the source of the gas emitted will be on the ground level, the gas-proof room should be as high as possible, but it is understood that light-case high explosive bombs may be expected to burst after passing through the upper two or three storeys of well-built houses, and to guard against their effects, the refuge should be as low as possible. A compromise will generally have to be made, but it is considered that the first floor would be preferable as far as gas alone is concerned. In view of the danger of gas collecting in low-lying places, people should be instructed to avoid cellars as far as possible.Assuming that protected rooms have been prepared in all private houses, and more elaborate arrangements, as indicated above, in all business premises and Government offices, it will still be necessary to provide a large number of public refuges where persons, caught in the street by the alarm signal for a raid, and not near their own houses or business places, could obtain proper shelter. The entrance to these can easily be fitted to prevent the entry of gas.The selection of suitable rooms in the main thoroughfares of large cities will be a matter for the municipal authorities. Their selection and protection need not interfere with their ordinary use, but their function in a gas raid must be indicated by clearly visible notices outside, and must be&quot;known to the police.The question naturally arises as to when the gas-proofing of rooms and buildings is to be undertaken. Should it be done in peace time or must it be left until the outbreak of war. The Committee are of opinion that if information is distributed in peace householders will, of their own initiative, consider which room or rooms they will make gas tight in emergency, and some of them will probably try experiments. The explicit instructions issued on the outbreak of war should, in any case, enable people to protect their rooms without any special difficulty or delay.It is worth considering whether the detailed Government instructions for protecting rooms should be given to large business firms in peace time. If so, the managers might be encouraged and given expert assistance in planning out. the gas protection arrangements for their staffs, and assisted to experiment if they so wish; but it is not considered advisable to go further until the outbreak of war.The instructions should be issued to Government offices so that where elaborate fittings are required to enable the protected rooms to be entered and left during the danger period, these more permanent fittings could be built and maintained iri peace time.
A serious point for consideration arises in connection with, the tubes and underground railways, particularly the former, which are ventilated by forced draught and which afford excellent protection against H.E. bombs. If a gas bomb fell near the entry of the air, the ventilation would draw gas down into the tube and so gas the people sheltering in it.8. The Organisation of a Service for Clearing an Area of Gas.When the raid is over, immediate action must be taken, by the responsible authority, to find out where gas bombs have dropped or where gas has been sprayed, and to take steps to free the surrounding area from gas. The detection of gassed areas and of the real extent of the contamination is a problem of great difficulty and can only be done by skilled personnel. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that a staff trained in the detection and destruction of chemical warfare agents should be at hand to determine, as far as possible, the nature and extent of the gassing, and to give instructions as to desirable modifications in the standard procedure in order to ensure the best results.Two main aspects of the problem of clearing an area of gas require consideration, viz.: (a.) The removal of any gas that may have collected in the atmosphere. Except when there is no wind, (and the very serious aspects of a London fog must be borne in mind in this connection, when the removal of the gas on any scale is practically impossible), the gas in the atmosphere will be soon swept away by eddy currents, but attention will have to be paid to low-lying places, such as cellars, basements, &amp;c, where there is no ventilation and where gas may, under these conditions, remain for long periods and prove a source of danger. Such places can be cleared when the surrounding atmosphere is free from gas by providing ventilation, and this can usually be achieved very simply by lighting a fire or an oil lamp or stove in such a position as to provide a good draught throughout the space to be cleared. When the &quot;all clear &quot; is given, it is important in those districts where gas has been used that the people should open all their doors and windows so that the ventilation may dissipate any gas that may be hanging about in the houses.(6.) The destruction of toxic liquid on the ground, which will otherwise continue to give off dangerous vapour until it has all evaporated. The problem is complicated by the fact that there is no single chemical which will destroy all the liquids which might be employed, e.g., while hypochlorite solutions will neutralise mustard gas and Lewisite, chloropicrin. is&apos; unaffected by them.. It will, therefore be necessary to employ some method which will be really effective for the liquids which are most feared, such as mustard gas, and will at the same time help to get rid of other gases.Experiments are now being put in hand at Porton to ascertain the best practical method of decontaminating different types of areas affected by mustard gas, and until these experiments have been completed no exact procedure can be finally laid down. In the following paragraphs the methods mentioned are those which appear at the moment to offer the best prospects of success, and they are quoted only to give a general indication of the nature of the operations involved.9. General Scheme of Decontamination.It is necessary to have trained personnel provided with anti-gas appliances, i.e., respirators and protective clothing, to decontaminate a city after a gas attack. It will be highly advantageous if this decontamination service can be undertaken by the Municipal authorities, and delegated by them to existing services having regular peace-time duties. As already mentioned, trained chemical warfare personnel should be available to determine the nature and extent of the gassing and to supervise the decontamination. It must be remembered that an enemy may drop high explosive or incendiary bombs at the same time as gas, and that immediately after a raid a large part of the Fire Brigade may be expected to be fully occupied with fires.
A city may be divided into the following categories from the point of view of decontamination : (a.) Water surfaces.(&amp;.) Open spaces, e.g., gardens and parks. (c.) Streets. (d.) Houses.(e.) Back areas or gardens of houses. (/.) Roof surfaces.The following suggestions are made as to the action which will be required in regard to each of the above : (a.) Water surfaces other than reservoirs for supply of water to a town need no decontamination. Rivers and canals could thus be used as a means of distributing supplies, if necessary. The question of the action to be taken in the case of gas bombs dropping into reservoirs will be investigated experimentally.(b.) Open Spaces. This term is intended to apply to gardens, parks and similar open spaces which are not absolutely essential to the life of the community, that is to say, the every day needs of the people are not vitally affected if the use of these open spaces is prohibited. They should be closed after a raid until pronounced free from contamination.(c.) Streets. We do not at present know what is the best method to use for decontaminating a street, as a good deal may depend on the nature of the material of which the street is made, e.g., it may consist of concrete, tarred wood blocks, cobbles or a Macadam surface. The effect of mustard gas on each of these requires to be ascertained. There is no doubt, however, that considerable benefit would be obtained by a thorough hosing down with water, which would destroy some of the mustard gas by hydrolysis and would also wash a further amount down the drains where it would not be dangerous. The water would also fill up the bomb-holes and so seal off any toxic liquid left in them, which could then be destroyed by an appropriate chemical. The hosing would have to include sides of houses and vehicles, and. in fact, anything in the gassed area which was likely to be contaminated. Care would of course be necessary to prevent the mustard gas being splashed about by the hosing and so contaminating further areas or the people carrying out the operations.A certain amount of the mustard gas may, however, be absorbed in tarred wood or concrete or cement road surfaces, and it may therefore prove necessary to follow the washing down by watering carts filled with hypochlorite solutions, which might be left on the contaminated roads for an hour or more; the roads could afterwards be hosed down a second time and might then be considered clear of contamination. Care would have to be taken to ensure that toxic liquid had not collected in the various manholes in the street, leading to the electric, gas or water mains. In cases of very heavy contamination, it might be necessary, and in fact might be the only practical course, to close off the street or road and to evacuate all the inhabitants until it had been thoroughly cleansed.The results of the experiments now being arranged must, however, be awaited before a final recommendation on the subject can be made.(d.) Houses. Where houses are penetrated by bombs containing mustard gas or a similar liquid, evacuation is the only feasible course. Such evacuation may involve the houses on either side if the contamination is very heavy. Decontamina-tion is, however, necessary as a preliminary to repair work, and this might be carried out by the fire brigade. The difficulties of ensuring complete destruction or removal of the gas are very great and all demolition and repair would have to be done cautiously for some time.Care would also have to be taken in the case of houses in which the windows may have been broken by bombs in the street. All rooms into which gas might have penetrated in this way&quot; should have the doors and windows opened to give good ventilation and should not be occupied for several days or until pronounced safe by a competent authority.(e.) Back Areas. The term &quot;back areas&quot; is meant to apply to yards and gardens of houses, the use of which is essential to the every day activities of the household. If these are contaminated, it will be necessary to evacuate the house, unless it is possible to carry out the decontamination at once.(f.) Roof Surfaces. It will probably be best to leave roof surfaces alone, and allow the rain and sun to destroy the mustard gas, which they will undoubtedly do
in time. If it should prove necessary to decontaminate them, it could best be done by the Fire Brigade using fire escapes and hosing them well down.10. Action to be taken when the &quot;All Clear&quot; is given.The question of when and how the &quot;all clear&quot; is to be given requires very careful consideration. It would certainly be inadvisable to give a general &quot; all clear &quot; until the attack was over and the contaminated areas had either been disinfected or barricaded off so as to prevent people having access to them. The latter work might take some considerable time to complete, and if the attack were confined to a comparatively limited area, it might be inadvisable to keep the whole of the popula-tion of a city such as London in their protected rooms, until the affected areas were dealt with. If the areas in question could be shut off for a time, the possibility of giving; local &quot;all clear &quot; signals in other areas should be carefully investigated.While the work of decontamination was in progress, the ambulance services would deal with any casualties in the streets or in the houses that had been hit. Such casualties might be due to H.E., gas or fire. The people from any houses that had to be evacuated would be, at the same time, sent by the safest possible route to the nearest decontamination centre, if possible outside the area affected. When the &quot;all clear&quot; was given, people would emerge from their protected rooms and resume their normal vocations. In areas where gas had been used a fact which could be notified to the inhabitants it would be necessary for all doors and windows of buildings to be opened wide and fires lighted to dissipate any gas that might be hanging about. People who suspected that they had been contaminated would report at once to the nearest decontamination centre or, better still, would change their clothes and take a hot bath, giving the whole body a thorough washing with soap and water, in their own homes. These clothes should be hung out to air for at least forty-eight hours or, if contamination with actual liquid was suspected, removed at once to the nearest decontamination centre for treatment. In doing so, care would have to be taken to prevent contact of the skin with the garments affected. The same action should be taken in regard to any other materials, such as curtains, suspected of contamination. As soon as any symptoms of gassing appeared, the patients would report at once to the nearest treatment centre. People should also be warned against the consumption of any food or drink likely to have been exposed to the gas.11. Treatment and Decontamination Centres.It is understood that the task of providing treatment centres for casualties caused by air raids has been allotted to the Ministry of Health. In the case of gas it will perhaps be best not to use the hospitals which will probably be fully occupied but to establish special centres, as a large number of mild cases of gassing may have to be treated. Provision would have to be made for the evacuation of serious cases, e.g., eye cases suffering from temporary blindness, to hospitals or centres preferably outside, or on the outskirts of, the town. The mild cases could return to their own homes, reporting for further treatment as instructed, or being attended by their own doctors.Decontamination stations will have to be established where people who have been in contact with gas, or suspect contamination, can report. It is suggested that public baths might be used for the purpose, and that the location of such baths and the number that each can deal with should be ascertained. The requirements of a decontamination station are : (a.) Water (hot and cold).(b.) Bathing arrangements preferably sprays and shower baths, (c.) Fresh clothing.(d.) Means for decontaminating clothing.The problem of decontaminating garments and of supplying fresh clothing is a very difficult one, which will require further consideration. Probably it will be necessary for the Government to supply bales of simple clothing for both sexes to these stations on the outbreak of war.It is very difficult to forecast the number of casualties and contaminated cases to be dealt with, but 1 per cent, of the day population of each borough is suggested as a
working figure to cover both, categories, and it is recommended that provision for this should be made.The necessary instructions for the treatment of patients and the decontamination&apos; of their clothing can be drafted later, and the Committee will be glad to give the Ministry of Health any further information it may require.12. Summary.The Committee recommend-I. That a stock of mustard gas bombs and a means for their immediate use as a retaliatory measure should be maintained in peace time.   (Para. 2.)2. That in view of the danger from a gas bombing attack, every effort should be made to perfect our defensive measures against aircraft.   (Para. 3.)3. That the elementary principles of protection against gas should be disseminated, as far as practicable, in peace time.   (Para. 5.)4. That preparations be made in peace, to issue on the outbreak of war, specific instructions as to the proper precautions to be taken by civilians in a gas raid. (Para. 5.)5. That the principal measure of protection consists in going indoors and remaining there until the &quot; all clear &quot; signal has been given.   (Para. 7.)6. That the protection of rooms against gas be arranged for in all houses, offices and business premises on the outbreak of war; people remaining in these will be practically safe.   (Para. 7.)7. That more elaborate arrangements for the protection of rooms against gas may be desirable in large business premises and in some Government offices, before the outbreak of war.   (Para. 7.)8. That public shelters should also be provided on the outbreak of war. (Para. 7.)9. That the various Services concerned in carrying out the requisite defensive measures should be supplied with anti-gas protection and trained in its use in peace. (Para. 8.)10. That there should be, if possible, two gas alarm signals, the first in the nature of a warning, and the second ordering immediate stoppage of traffic and that evervone should at once take refuge. There should also be an &quot;all clear&quot; signal. (Paras. 6 and 10.)II. That arrangements should be made for clearing areas of gas and destroying any liquid contamination that may remain after the raid.   (Paras. 8 and 9.)12. That in cases of gross contamination, the area affected should be evacuated and barricaded off until it had been rendered safe.   (Para. 9.) -13. That treatment and decontamination centres be provided, together with the necessary ambulance arrangements.   (Para. 11.)Section III. -Organisation of the Protective Services.1. General.The protective measures described in Section II will involve a number of bodies, and it is therefore necessary to consider carefully how these should be co-ordinated and controlled in war, as the efficiency of the arrangements proposed will depend to a very great extent on proper direction.   The following bodies are involved : (a.) The Central Directing Authority.(&amp;.) The Police (including the Special Constabulary).(c.) The Fire Brigade.(d.) Municipal street cleaning and other services. (e.) Ambulance Corps.(/.) Personnel for treatment and decontamination centres.(a.)2. The Central Directing Authority.It seems absolutely necessary that there should be one central authority, who can command the whole protection scheme in emergency, i.e., during and after a raid.This appears the only way by which the police and other services mentioned above can be enabled to co-operate effectively, and by which the available skilled personnel, technical appliances and decontaminating material can be concentrated, where wanted.[13775] e
It seems desirable that the central authority where possible, should be military, even though most of the other bodies concerned consist of personnel organised and maintained by the Municipal authorities.   The reasons for this are : (1.) It is a form of fighting, and as such is best understood by the Military. (2.) The defence of London as a whole will be under the Military, and theprotective organisation against gas attacks is a part of this whole. (3.) The Military will have the best information as to the approach of raids andof the probable nature of the gas to be used. (4.) The Military command the A.A, guns, and aircraft, the employment ofwhich, forms part and parcel of the defence scheme. (5.) A civil authority might have difficulty in commanding other civil institu-tions not normally under him, but all municipal authorities understand the necessity for military command of a town in time of emergency, this being the common practice of war.The Officer in Command will require to be continually furnished with precise information as to the position of a raid and the progress of decontamination. For this he must be in touch with the Police, for Whose use the telephone service must be kept going, necessitating protected exchanges.Under this central authority, there must be a body of Military personnel of officer rank, trained in the detection and destruction of poison gases, who can be at once sent to the gassed areas to direct operations. These officers would be authorised to control all the decontamination services within their areas and to take such action as they considered essential after communication where necessary with the central authority for the proper clearing-up of their districts. Thus they should have the power to order the evacuation of houses or the closing of streets, if such was essential in the interests of public safety. This staff will require to be trained in peace, but if the personnel are specially enrolled in the Chemical Warfare Branch of the Supplementary Reserve for which provision is contemplated in the near future, the training should not present any really serious difficulty.(b.)3. The Police.The Police should form a very important part of the protective services. They, like the decontamination services, should be supplied with gas masks and protective clothing. Their duty would be to compel all persons to take refuge in a gas raid, and to keep them indoors until&apos;the &quot; all clear &quot; signal is given; to direct people to public gas shelters and, after a raid, to decontamination and first aid stations; to inform the central authority of the position and extent of a raid, and of the progress of decontamination, to stop traffic on warning of a raid and arrange for it to be parked conveniently so as to have the main roads clear for washing down. In these duties they would be assisted by the Special Constabulary.(c.)4. The Fire Brigade.The primary function of the Fire Brigade would be to deal with fires, but they would no doubt be available after a raid to assist in special decontamination work, such as would be required for roofs and high houses and for houses wholly or partially demolished by gas bombs.(d.)5. The Municipal Street Cleaning and Other Services.Various Municipal services would be required for decontamination work and might include street cleaners, park keepers, &amp;c. In the case of areas which may have to be evacuated and barricaded off, provision would have to be made for the erection of the necessary barricades.(e.)6. Ambulance Corps.The Ambulance Services would be required for the removal of casualties, and no doubt the Ministry of Health has in view the means of augmenting the peace-time Ambulance Corps to enable it to cope with the work.
(f.)7. Personnel for First Aid and Decontamination Centres.The first aid and decontamination services could probably be manned by suitable voluntary workers, and the only permanent staff would be in the nature of caretakers to ensure that the buildings and stores were maintained ready for use at a moment&apos;s notice.The above is merely an outline of the duties of the different bodies likely to be concerned in the scheme of anti-gas protection, and is not to be regarded as complete, as the experimental work now in hand may modify the details of the scheme. The organisation is shown in diagrammatic form in an Appendix.8. Organisation and Training in Peace of the Protective Services.Though the organisation will in war be commanded by the Military, it is suggested that the responsibility for organising and training the different constituent bodies in peace should be undertaken by the London County Council in the case of London, by the County Borough Councils in the case of large towns of 50,000 inhabitants and above, and by the County Councils operating through their subordinate town and district councils in the case of the remainder of the country.If this recommendation be adopted, it will be necessary for the appropriate Government Departments to circularise these authorities and to supply them with full information as to the nature of the gas attack which may be expected, and of the policy which has been decided on in regard to protection against the same, and to request them to communicate sufficient information to their employees to enable them to understand and assist intelligently in the organisation to be created. The knowledge thus disseminated will help in the general education, besides forming the ground work of the protective organisation. Further, it is considered that all the services mentioned above which form a part of the organisation will require certain special instruction in the duties during peace. They will all have to be equipped with respirators and special clothing to protect the body against substances like mustard gas. As men must be fitted with respirators and trained in their use to enable them to carry out their duties efficiently, when protected against gas, it is essential that the necessary protective devices should be available in peace, and the men given sufficient practice in wearing them while performing duties similar to those which they will have to carry out during a gas raid. It will not do to wait until the outbreak of war before protective appliances are obtained, as it would not be possible to manufacture them in time, and already it appears that, in the first few months of a war, our resources will be strained to meet the needs of the fighting services for protective appliances of this nature. Further, it will be necessary to give the services responsible for decontamination or, at any rate, a number of those in charge, instruction in the carrying out of the methods recommended. If gas may be used on the outbreak of war, then such instruction would have to be given in peace. A more detailed scheme of training can be prepared, if desired, when the general policy to be adopted has been indicated.An estimate of the cost is difficult to give at the moment, but it may be taken that respirators will cost about  1 each and may last about five years. The cost and life of protective clothing cannot be estimated, as the development of suitable garments is still in hand.It may also be necessary to consider special cases in which the continuance of essential duties during a raid is imperative, e.g., in the case of railways, factories or dockyards, dealing with essential supplies to the fighting forces, the delivery of which must not be interrupted. These cases could probably be restricted to a few ports of embarkation, but, in any case, it would involve the provision of the necessary protective appliances.9. SummaryAn organisation, controlled where possible by a central military authority and involving the Police, Fire Brigade, street cleansing and other Municipal services, the Ambulance Corps and voluntary first aid societies, is recommended for dealing with the prntA^tive measures necessary in the case of gas attacks from the air.

Copy No.    31COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 204th Meeting, held on October 29, 1925.* w * .   * * *(1.)-AIR  RAIDS  PRECAUTIONS :   REPORT   OF   SUB-COMMITTEE. (OLD. Papers Nos. 132-A, 134-A, 135-A, 140-A and 143-A.)(Previous References : C.I.D. Minutes of 179th Meeting, Minute 3, 180th Meeting, Minute 1, 194th Meeting, Minute 7, 200th Meeting, Minute 2, and 202nd Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration various Papers on the subject of Air Raids Precautions, viz : C.I.D. Papers Nos. 132-A, 134-A, 135-A, 140-A and 143-A.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked Sir John Anderson and the other members of the various Sub-Committees who had undertaken the arduous task of the present enquiry.SIR JOHN ANDERSON, after thanking the Prime Minister for his remarks, pointed out that so far it had only been possible to make a very superficial enquiry into the wide range of subjects involved in their Terms of Reference. Before any concrete plans could emerge a great deal of detailed work would have to be undertaken. In regard to the education of the public, his Committee had felt that this was really a matter for Ministers. They thought it only right to emphasise, however, that in their opinion any precautionary measures which could be suggested would almost certainly prove futile if the public was in no way prepared for their reception. There were some signs that the public were gradually realising the significance of air attack. His Committee did not advocate that any considerable steps should be taken at oiiot. with the object of creating a wider knowledge of attack from the air and its unavoidable consequences, but rather that the process of education in this respect should be slow and gradual so as to eliminate as far as possible the chance of creating undue alarm.SIR L. WORTHINGTOiN-EVANS stated that he had nothing to add to the Paper (C.LD. Paper No. 140-A) which had been circulated by the General Staff. He did not wish in any way to under-estimate the danger to which this country was exposed from the air, but he felt that in this particular instance the Air Staff had allowed itself considerable latitude in regard to the weight of bombs which might reasonably be anticipated.SIR SAMUEL HOARE expressed the opinion that the estimate of the Air Staff was not overstated. It was impossible to dogmatise in a matter of this nature, but he reminded the Committee that the actual scale of attack had been considered three years ago and had at that time been accepted by the General Staff and the Secretary of State for War. Although politically conditions had altered which made the chance of a war with France more remote, yet the conditions which ewerned the actual scale of attack, should such a calamity unfortunately occur, remained unaltered. Further, he emphasised that even supposing that the scale of attack was considerably reduced, the recommendations put forward would still remain the same.[13751-1]
LORD CA.VAN referred to an Air Intelligence Report which had been issued by the Air Staff, and pointed out that the deductions contained therein did not correspond with the intentions attributed by the Air Staff to the French in their Paper No. 143-A. He did not think that it was likely that the French would use their Army co-operations squadrons for the bombing of England. For this reason he thought the picture had been somewhat overdrawn.SIR JOHN ANDERSON stated that in the view of his Committee, even supposing the scale of attack was reduced by half, their recommendations would remain substantially the same.LORD BE ATT Y intimated that he had no remarks to make as the subject did not affect naval policy.   The naval staff concurred in the Report.SIR HENRY PAYNE informed the Committee that the President of the Board of Trade considered that it was very doubtful whether the scheme suggested in the Report would prove workable in the event of air attack on the scale contemplated. He thought that so far as London was concerned there would probably be a general stampede of the population; that it would be almost impossible to guide the large numbers of refugees into prearranged concentration camps; and that the difficulties of food supply would be very much increased with roads blocked by traffic and railways to a great extent out of action. Fie suggested that it would be advisable to consider the question of the general conscription of the whole male population of London with a view to placing them under military control. He was of opinion, in fact, that a larger measure of control would have to be introduced than that contemplated in the Report of the Committee.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that he was going to suggest that this question of control should be further considered by Sir John Anderson&apos;s Committee working in co-ordination with Mr. Hipwood&apos;s Committee.Mr. NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN stated that, apart from the suggestion of the President of the Board of Trade, which, in his opinion, was a matter requiring further investigation, he had nothing to add to the discussion. He had no points to bring before the Committee, and his Department was prepared to co-operate on the lines suggested.Mr. HARDING stated that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs considered that if the Reports of the Air Raids Precautions Committee and the Chemical Warfare Committee (Papers Nos. 134-A and 135-A) were approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence, they should be communicated to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions, either officially or privately, as otherwise they would not fully realise what the problem of security, so far as Great Britain was concerned, really involved.THE PRIME MINISTER considered that no advantage would accrue by communicating these Reports to the Dominions at the present stage. He thought it would probably be preferable to inform the Dominion representatives at the next Imperial Conference.LORD PEEL stated that he had no points to bring before the Committee other than matters of detail. His Department was engaged in drawing up plans for shelters against the possible use of poison gas, and were awaiting particulars in regard to the size of bombs and their probable effects on detonation. They were also preparing figures in regard to the possible transfer of the seat of Government. It would be possible by making available such buildings as hospitals, &amp;c, to accommodate the whole of the Government at Liverpool. These were, however, matters of detail, and he would like some guidance as to how far these questions should be pursued.SIR MAURICE HANKEY stated that Lord Salisbury, who was prevented from attending the meeting, wished that attention should be drawn to the necessity of having plans in readiness for moving the capital.SIR W. MITCHELL-THOMSON stated that the question of the removal of the seat of Government affected his Department to some extent, as it would be possible, if an alternative centre was decided upon, to make certain arrangements in advance which would facilitate communications.COLONEL ASHLEY stated that the Ministry of Transport also was closely concerned in regard to any such move.
SIR SAMUEL HO ARE pointed out that the Committee appeared to favour Birmingham rather than Liverpool, on the grounds that it was less easily located.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD said that Birmingham was, of course, very much safer than London, as hostile raiders would be obliged to pass over a longer stretch -of our own country before reaching their objective. There was little to choose between Liverpool and Birmingham. In regard to the scale of attack, which had been criticised in some quarters, he wished to point out that the Air Staff had made their estimate on as conservative a basis as possible. In computing the weight of bombs, only one trip per French aeroplane per day had been allowed, whereas, of course, having regard to the distances involved, two, or even three, trips per aeroplane per day were not impracticable. He did not consider, however, that the effects of air attack could be measured in terms of damage only. The experience of the last war went to prove that the dislocation caused by the passage of hostile aircraft, even when no bomlbs were dropped at all, was very considerable. The issue of an alarm on the approach of hostile aircraft had reduced the output of factories to a very con-siderable extent, though no actual attack-was delivered. Further, he attached the greatest importance to a gradual education of the public to the significance of air attack. His experience had been that individuals, when first confronted with the possible consequences of aerial bombardment, were appalled by its gravity, but were not so affected when more familiar with the subject.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that he thought the questions of the education of the public and the removal of the seat of the Government were matters for the Cabinet to consider. In the meantime he thought enquiries should be pursued as to the best alternative site for the seat of Government.SIR NOEL BIRCH stated that he had had a good deal of experience in regard to metal and explosives, and he did not think that the bombardment of a city from the air. was so serious a menace as a siege. Traffic could not be held up unless the bombing was continuous. He cited the case of the raid by German naval forces at Scarborough and ITartlepool, when no less than 694 casualties were occasioned. In comparison with this, eighteen air raids had only resulted in 2,048 casualties. The difference was due, he thought, to the fact that in the former case the line of fire was horizontal, whereas in the latter it was perpendicular. In fact, in his view, bombing was not so destructive as shelling. The most important part of London from a national point of view may be taken to be that centring round Charing Cross, com-. prising roughly some 40 square miles. Only 30 per cent, of this area was covered with buildings, of which only 5 per cent, included important offices and railway termini. His Department had recently carried out certain experiments in regard to the destructive power of bombs. A bomb was placed 15 yards from a two-storied building, which was deprived of some of its strength, as it was not provided with a roof. The house was not destroyed by the detonation, and twelve rabbits which had been placed inside were unaffected by the shock. From this it was deduced that, if a bomb weighing about half a ton burst against a building, such as the War Office, the only result would be a number of broken windows. The effect of armour-piercing bombs on 3 ft. 6 in. concrete was known, but there was no data available in regard to the effect on iron roofs. More experiment and research was required before this matter could be determined.LORD BIRKENITEAD enquired whether any information was as yet available from the Anti-Aircraft Research Committee, which had recently been set up by the Committee of Imperial Defence under the Chairmanship of Lord Haldane. The findings of this Committee must inevitably have a bearing on the extent of the menace to which this country was exposed. He suggested that questions might be put to this Committee with a view to ascertaining whether there were any prospects in the immediate future of an appreciable improvement in the means of combating hostile aircraft; whether there was any likelihood of an entirely new method or methods being discovered of destroying aircraft, and whether there was any prospect of improvement in subsidiary measures&apos; which would appreciably facilitate the task of our defence organisation. For example, whether it was possible to obtain speedier and more precise information as to the enemy&apos;s approach.Conclusion.It was agreed (a.) To approve the Report of the Air Raid Precautions Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 135-A) and to authorise the Departments to carry
out the investigations and preparations recommended therein, provided that no expenditure should be incurred without Treasury authority and a further reference, if necessary, to the Committee of Imperial Defence.(&amp;.) That the Sub-Committee on Air Raid Precautions should be reconstituted as a Standing Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence as recommended in paragraph 146 of the Report, and should continue its investigations with the same terms of reference.(c.) To take note of the Report of Mr. Hipwood&apos;s (Board of Trade) Committee on &quot; The Supply of London in the event of the Port of London being wholly or partially closed &quot; (C.I.D. Paper No. 132-A), and to request this Committee,&apos; in co-ordination with the Standing Sub-Committee mentioned in (6) above, to pursue its investigations and also to examine and report on (i.) The best means of maintaining the machinery of distribution inLondon and other objectives of hostile air attack. &quot; (ii.) The provision of necessary supplies to areas congested by the influx of large numbers of refugees.(d.) That the Committee on Anti-Aircraft Research should be asked to submit an interim report as early as possible on the following points : (i.) Does the trend of Research hold out any prospects in the immediate future of appreciable improvement in the already existing means of combating hostile aircraft ? (ii.) Is there any likelihood of an entirely new method or methods being discovered of (a.) Destroying hostile aircraft.(b.) Providing means which would act as effective deterrents to attack on special areas of vital importance.(iii.) Having regard to the particular circumstances of the situation and especially the geographical position of London, is there any prospect of improvement in subsidiary measures which would appreciably facilitate the task of our defence organisation e.g., speedier and more precise information as to the approach of the enemy ?(iv.) What additional stimulus is needed in order to secure an appreci-able improvement in the directions outlined above within a reasonable period of time ?(e.) To take note of the Report of the Chemical Warfare Committee on the Protection of the civil population against gas attack (C.I.D. Paper No. 134-A).(/.) That the Reports (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 134-A and 135-A), together with the recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence thereon, should be circulated to the Cabinet for information, with particular reference to (i.) &apos;lne Education of the Public.(ii.) The Removal of the Seat of Government.(g.) That the Reports mentioned in (/) above should not be communicated to the Governments of the Dominions until the schemes proposed therein have been further examined and have assumed more concrete form.(A.) That all Departments should render such assistance as lies wuthin their power, having regard to the provisions of Conclusion (a) above, in the conduct of experiments with a view to securing the greatest possible measure of protection for the civilian population against the effect of aerial bombardment and gas attack.* .     w - * - * * *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, October 29, 1925.o
