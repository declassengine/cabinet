CABIN3T. \Copy No.    ^&quot;C.P. 453  (25).LAMP S3TTLSMSNT (FAC ILITUJiS) AMiSHDMBKT BILL .Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.This Bill raises no new question of principle: it is concerned merely with machinery.The procedure set out la the Bill has been discussed, in detail with the Treasury and with, the County Councils Association and representatives of counter boroughs .   It is expected that the Bill will be , treated a3 an agreed measure.I recommend that the Home Affairs Committee should approve the Bill subject to any minor verbal alterations which may be found to be necessary after consultation with representatives of Local Authorities and of Government Departments concerned.I attach a short memorandum explaining the purpose and main features of the Bill.W.S.G.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 5th November, 1925.
The Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, provided inter alia:(i) that the Ministry should repay to any County Council or Council of a County Borough which incurred a loss in the provision of small holdings during the period 1903 to 1926 the amount of such loss provided that it had been reasonably and necessarily incurred (Section 26);    and(ii) that as at 1st April-, 1926, there shall be ascertained (a) the value of each Council71* lute rest in Its small holdings estate and (b) its outstanding capital liabilities in respect of such estate;    andif it is found that the liability exceeds the value of the assets, the Ministry shall pay to the Council in future years a part of its annual loan charges pro-port ionate to such excess (Section 27).The declared intention of the Government in 1919 was that all losses up to 1st April 1926 should fall on the State and that after that date the f inar.&apos;o :\al responsibility should be transferred to the Councils upon terms vhich, would enable them to carry on their undertakings without either making a profit or incurring a loss.Unfortunately it has been found that the terms of Section 27 will not carry out the intention and pledges of the Government in 1919.     The principal reason for this is that as worded the Section takes no account of the rate of interest payable by Councils on loans raised to meet capital expenditure.     Under the Section the capital value of the estate is to be compared with the outstanding capital liabilities, regardless of the annual payments to which a Council is committed in respect of such liabilities.   As the majority of loans since trie War have been issued at 6-^ or 6%, this is a matter of fundamental importance.The proposed Bill seeks to amend the Section in the following ways:-(1) The valuation of both assets and liabilities of Councils is to be made on an annual and not a capital basis.(2)   The Ministry&apos;s payment in any year is to be the difference between these two sums.(3)   The valuation is to be carried out by agreement between the Ministry and the Council, and only points in dispute are to be referred to arbitration.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 5th November, 1925c
