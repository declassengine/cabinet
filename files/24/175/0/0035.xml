CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY, j This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;! 3 printed for the Cabinet.   October 1925.SECRET. Copy No.    30CP 435/25.(Also C.I.D. Paper No. 637-B.)CABINET.MOSUL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN view of the forthcoming discussion on the Mosul question, I think my colleagues may find it helpful to have before them some notes on the Turkish incursions into Iraq in the autumn of 1924.2. Accordingly, I circulate herewith the following documents : (A.) An appreciation by the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq of the situa-tion on the northern frontier of Iraq in September and October 1924.(B.) A note on the strength of the British and Turkish forces employed in the operations carried out during this period.(C.) A letter from Sir Henry Dobbs, the High Commissioner, covering the Air Officer Commanding&apos;s despatch on these operations : for political reasons this despatch was not made public.3. It will be noted that apart from irregular troops the strength of the Turkish forces which actually operated in Iraq territory is estimated at--2,000 rifles, 400 sabres, 12 guns,and that air action was the main element whereby the Air Officer Commanding frustrated the Turkish advance.S. H.,Secretary of State for A ir.Air Ministry, October 17, 1925.(A;)Appreciation of the Situation on the Northern Frontier of Iraq,September-October 1924.(a.) Turkish intentions. (bf) Air offensive.(c.) The difficulties encountered and their effect ou the course of operations. (d.) The results achieved.Appbeciation. (a.) Turkish Intentions.1. The exact intentions of the Turks must remain to a certain extent conjectural, but at this juncture it is possible to form with reasonable accuracy some conception of the motives which prompted their actions.There can be no doubt that the operations were initiated as a direct result of the predominant desire to regain the coveted Mosul Vilayet. [13686]
It was in all probability realised by the Turks that any attempt to achieve this end would be resisted, but it is nevertheless possible that the Turks, having due regard to the political situation confronting His Majesty&apos;s Government, both at home and abroad, were uncertain whether this resistance would take the form of active counter-measures, or whether resort would be made to the ordinary diplomatic channels.An organised military invasion of Iraq was for many reasons impracticable, but an alternative course was open to them.The conditions existing in Kurdistan in Iraq towards the end of 1922 had demonstrated the disturbing effect that even a few Turkish irregulars had on the Kurdish tribes.It was, therefore, by similar methods that the Turks might succeed in creating an unfavourable situation on the Northern Frontier, to be turned to their advantage at the Frontier discussions by means of a plebiscite, the ground for which would meanwhile have been carefully prepared.2. The first essential was to obtain the support of the Kurdish tribes in the Northern Frontier. The Turkish Government had been perturbed for some time by the pan-Kurdish movement, and had tried with but little success to regain control of these tribes. It was known that plans had been discussed for military measures to be taken in order to secure this, and by a movement of troop-s-towards the Northern Frontier, it would be possible not only to initiate the movement against the Mosul Vilayet, but thereby also regain their influence over the Kurds, who would be attracted by the prospect of raiding and looting offered by an incursion into territory nominally if not actually under Iraq control.Not only would such a policy provide a suitable diversion for Kurdish activities, but if successful, it would have enabled the Turks to proceed with a policy of infiltration into Iraq with Chettah bands and tribal elements, supported by Turkish Regular troops in close proximity in areas which might be regarded as debatable; the depth to which these troops would advance into Iraq territory would have depended no doubt on the amount of resistance offered by the forces in Iraq.That the assistance of tribal lashgars was largely depended upon is proved by the excessive propaganda carried out with all the Northern tribes.3. The incident of the Vali of Julamerk came at an opportune moment. The Vali had set out about the 5th August with escort to tour the area bordering on the Turkish-Iraqi Administrative Frontier for the purpose of collecting revenue.The Assyrians were alarmed at this move, which had been preceded hj much propaganda, and took up a defensive position at hankey.The Vali&apos;s party opened fire on the Assyrians, who retaliated, capturing the Vali and killing five of his escort.Although the Vali was released on the 11th August, it was improbable that the Turks would allow this incident to pass without retaliation, and the Turkish operations began with troop movements apparently alternatively intended as punitive measures against the Assyrians, or the Kurds.The Turks themselves originally gave the Kurdish tribes as the objective of the earlier movements, but it soon became apparent that they were in reality directed in the first instance against the Assyrians, as the Turks, far from taking measures against the Kurds, had in fact obtained their assistance in the form of lashgars.Further developments in the situation, however, made it clear that although the main immediate objective of the Turks was the Assyrians, these operations were only the prelude to further objectives, the nature of which would depend on the measure of success attending the initial stages.Thus, had punitive measures against the AssjTians only been intended, these could have been carried out equally well by Columns operating from Julamerk or Beit-es-Shebab, and would have achieved the same result as obtained by a violation of Iraq.4. This invasion therefore, in the first instance, inclined me to the belief that punitive operations might be intended against the Goyan, and neighbouring Kurdish tribes, but this impression was soon revised from the fact that the forces employed were out of all proportion to the magnitude of the problem confronting them, be it the punishment of the Assyrians, the Kurds or both.The effective air offensive waged in the initial stages, and continued later without remission, together with the firm attitude maintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government, was a decisive check to their operations from their inception, as a result of which, of all the ambitious objectives which were envisaged, that of the punishment of the Assyrians only was achieved.
It is consequently only possible to conjecture what form any further operations of the Turks might have taken, the possibilities of which I have already outlined, but the following considerations are sufficiently significant to indicate the probable course of events, had, the situation been met otherwise than by a firm hand and sustained resistance.5. Assuming that the operations were initiated with the object of regaining influence in, if not control of, the Mosul Vilayet, there were two methods by which this might be obtained : (i.) By a direct advance across the Frontier with troops and tribal irregularsin the hope that the effort necessary to restrain them, would not be taken,or would be delayed during diplomatic discussions, (ii.) By the  creation of such  conditions  of unrest  and  hostility  amongFrontier and Northern tribes, more especially in the Rowanduz area, asto render our position in Mosul embarrassing.That success would attend (i) ab initio was for obvious reasons improbable, but such a movement might have been later incorporated with (ii), which plan was not only the one most likely to be successful, but was also in accordance with previous Turkish policy.The desired state of unrest could be obtained by the presence of troops on the Frontier, combined with Chettah band activities and propaganda giving Mosul as the ultimate objective, and this could be relied upon to secure the assistance of the Kurdish tribes if left unchecked.6. The sector of the Frontier most suited for operations of this nature was that of Rowanduz, both from the strategical and topographical point of view, as not only had the tribes in that area only recently been brought under control, and would, therefore, be more susceptible to Turkish influence, but the nature of the terrain was such as to offer the maximum cover from air action for some depth into Iraq, and most suited to guerilla warfare against any troops which might be used against them.An advance on the Right Bank of the Tigris, or between the Tigris and Amadia, if carried to any depth, would have exposed their forces to air action in more or less, open country.Moreover, by regaining influence in the Rowanduz Sector, which would soon have been extended to Southern Kurdistan, a situation might have arisen rendering the retention of Mosul precarious by virtue of the threat to the right flank of the Line of Communication. Any withdrawal on our part would then have been followed by an advance across the line Zakho-Amadia.7. The opening moves of the Turkish troops were not clear until the movements in the Van-Neri Sector disclosed the main objective.The Turks must have been aware, despite their equivocations, that the advance along the line Hauris to Ashuta was a violation of the statics quo, and it must there-fore be assumed that this was done deliberately, and probably for the following reasons: (i.) It provided a ready means of access to the Assyrian area, which, in con-junction with the operations of the other columns, may have been destined to cut off their retreat into Iraq, (ii.) By advancing into territory which could be regarded as debatable, they were given the opportunity of ascertaining the attitude of His Majesty&apos;? Government and the forces in Iraq, to an attempt to establish claims to such areas.(iii.) It  provided an  additional means of  obtaining  tribal support  and disseminating propaganda.(iv.) Finally, it diverted attention from the Rowanduz Sector, now the obvious objective.It is therefore reasonable to assume that success in the first instance would have been followed by an advance into this area, whether by troops or organised irregulars is immaterial, as the results would have been the same in the end.This situation could not have been dealt with by the forces at my immediate disposal.(b.) Air Offensive. 8. The Turkish intentions were frustrated.The basis of the resistance offered was air action, and it is scarcely open to doubt-that a deciding factor was the air offensive taken in the first instance.
The effects are not immediately apparent, and there is on this account a tendency not to give due weight to air action when estimating the factors which have led to success.- A more detailed consideration of the employment of air forces is left until later, but the following briefly summarises the decisive role played by them in the successful conclusion to the operations : (i.) A decisive check was administered to the Turkish advance at the first incursion over the Frontier, and maintained unremittingly against all subsequent movements, (ii.) The attitude of the forces in Iraq was thus displayed beyond all doubt at the outset.(iii.) As a result, within a small space of time, the defection of tribal lashgars was secured, which example had a salutary effect on other tribes which would otherwise have become hostile.(iv.) The effect on the tribes and inhabitants of Iraq generally of the successful offensive against the Turkish advance was an important factor, demonstrating as it did the firm intention to resist any attempt to regain the Mosul Vilayet.Ground troops were used only in a passive role and in small strength, the offensive being confined entirely to air forces, which, combined subsequently with the firm attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and later by the League decision as to the status quo, may be regarded as the factors which were instrumental in restoring the situation.(c.) The Difficulties encountered and their effect on the Course of Operations.9. The country North of Zakho-Amadia consists of a series of parallel ridges running generally East and West, varying in height from 2,500 to 11,000 feet, with corresponding deep and narrow valleys, some of which are as much as 3,500 feet above sea level. ..Below 5,000 feet the surface is covered with scrub oak, while at altitudes below 4,000 feet, oak, beech, hawthorn and cypress are found in abundance, which conditions, combined with the concealment afforded by gullies, caves and rocky area, rendered observation from the air difficult in the extreme.All Turkish movements were perforce carried out along the valleys, and machines had to descend from.the height of the surrounding hills in order to carry out a thorough search; the area for aerial manoeuvre was considerably restricted, and it was frequently necessary to ascend 2,000 to 3,000 feet before a search of the next valley could be carried out.These conditions obtained to a greater extent in the area East of the Khabur.It is on this account hardly surprising that air reconnaissances failed to locate any movement on the 11th to 13th September, as only small bodies had crossed into Iraq, and reliance had to be placed on intelligence reports.Information was reliable in the early stages, although it was difficult to obtain in time for action to be taken, owing to the difficulties of the country for the movement of informants.10. It seems probable that the Turks did not anticipate attack from the air, as there had been little or no attempt at concealment until after the successful action on the 14th September and following days, the effects of which, however, soon became apparent, as the enemy was forced to take cover and move in small parties.Air reconnaissances had been despatched at more or less regular intervals in the morning and evening, and it Was soon ascertained from intelligence reports that the Turks were moving by night and at midday and lying-up under cover at other periods.The early air offensive resulted in the following : (a.) Alternative lines of communication were forced on the enemy, in areasmore difficult for marching. (&amp;.) Movement had to be carried out at night, and at short intervals by day overdifficult country, and the rate of progress was much reduced; the move-ment of supplies was hampered by constant attacks on convoys, (c.) The desertion of tribal lashgars was secured, and the hire of animals for transport purposes to the Turks was refused.
(d.) Intelligence information proved that the combination of the above had considerable effect on the morale of the troops.11. The facilities for concealment were, however, almost unlimited, and the detection of enemy forces became increasingly difficult; the presence of troops in villages and areas was frequently reported where air observation completely failedIn some cases their presence was disclosed by machine gun and rifle fire directed on aircraft, whereas in others entire reliance had to be placed on intelligence reports.Accordingly, all areas likely to afford cover for troops or localities where their presence had been reported Avere attacked by formations of from three to five machines, dropping 20-lb. bombs, and searching cover with machine-gun fire, which methods enabled a large area to be covered.The effect was such as to draw fire from the ground, and to stampede transport animals, and thus discover the location of enemy troops and convoys which were then attacked with bombs and machine-gun fire.It was found when attacking machine-gun positions and rifle posts that, whereas fire from the rear gun seldom succeeded in silencing hostile fire, this result was generally achieved by diving in the direction of the fire and using the front gun. That this was effective is shewn by the results of the action taken against Desht-i-Masik on the 20th September.In this way a constant offensive was maintained on the enemy Line of Communication.Turkish movements were in consequence latterly carried out by night, and all animals were rigidly hobbled by day. As a result, towards the close of hostilities, the location of enemy troops on the Lines of Communication became more infre-quent, and the air offensive was developed on the lines of attacks on centres such as Shiranis and Ashuta,, where, although unobserved, troops were known to be present.It was my intention to employ these tactics by night as well as by day in the event of protracted hostilities.W/T, though not used to the best advantage in the early stages, with the exception of the first attack on the 14th September, was later used with singular success; no patrol went out without it, and reports of observations were sent to Wing Headquarters at frequent intervals, enabling relay patrols to be despatched in order to engage fleeting targets, before the return of the first patrol.20-lb. bombs were used exclusively, being most suitable for use against small bodies of troops and for the searching tactics already described.12. These must be studied in relation to the following factors which restricted the scope and effectiveness of air action : (a.) The difficult terrain for air observation and operations.(b.) The limitation necessarily placed on air action, under conditions virtuallythose of war, by confining action to that against troops within Iraqboundaries.(c.) The fact that both Squadrons were operating from Forward Bases with long Lines of Communication from Zakho to Mosul and Bagdad.13. The offensive was maintained by air forces, which, despite the difficulties encountered and the small strength employed, succeeded in confining the Turkish operations to punitive measures against the Assyrians, mainly by the two columns operating outside the boundaries of Iraq, against which forces I was not permitted to take action.The Turks failed in their endeavours to obtain the assistance of the tribes; this result must be credited to the. speed with which it was possible to offer an effective resistance to the Turkish advance by means of air forces at the first incursion into Iraq, and the facility with which this resistance was maintained.14. Pending a final decision regarding the Northern Frontier, the tribes are disposed to maintain a neutral attitude in order to avoid committing themselves with the Turks, and they are on that account inclined to adopt the cause of the side which displays the greater sign of force.The air offensive placed this issue beyond all doubt, as not only was the attitude of the Iraq forces madfi clear from the outset, but warfare under these conditions(d.) The Results Achieved.
presented no opportunities of retaliation and looting such as would be offered by the use of ground troops, which factor may be regarded as the one which largely deter-times the attitude of the tribes.15. It is by a comparison of the results which would have attended the use of ground troops in lieu of air forces that the value of air action under these circum-stances may be assessed at its proper value.In order to ensure success, ground forces would have had to be employed in strength; the forces necessary could not have been provided from the garrison in Iraq, and even assuming that they had been available, considerable delay must have ensued before their arrival on the Frontier.This delay would have enabled the Turks to advance into Iraq practically unopposed and obtain control of the Frontier tribes.The advent of Iraq troops with their inherent embarrassments of vulnerable Lines of Communication, and Supply Columns operating over difficult and unfamiliar country would have finally secured the allegiance of these tribes to the Turks, having in view the prospect of loot offered to them by the employment of guerilla warfare in coimtry not only admirably suited for the purpose, but with which they were intimately acquainted.The dangers of such a situation need no further emphasis.16. Finally, it is only necessary to compare (i.) The strength of the offensive forces employed, i.e., two Squadrons, against the Turks.(ii.) The casualties of those forces, two Officers and one N.C.O. wounded, with those of the Turks, admitted up to the 22nd September as one Officer and thirteen men killed, forty-four men wounded, and which may be estimated for the period of operations as not less than fifty killed and seventy-five wounded, apart from casualties to irregulars and transport animals.(B.)Note on Strength of British and Turkish Forces employed in Operations on Northern Frontier of Iraq in September-October, 1924.(A.)

Of these it is estimated that approximately 2,000 rifles, 400 sabres, and 12 guns actually operated in Iraq territory.  They formed two columns, plus troops for Lines of Communication.  In addition, irregulars were employed, but it is not possible to estimate their strength.Air Staff, October   1925.
o(Secret.)Sir, The Residency, Bagdad, May 28, 1925.I HAVE the honour to submit a.despatch by the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq, reporting the operations on the Northern Frontier of Iraq between September and November 1924.2. These operations began a few days before my return from leave on the 16th September, 1924. I was impressed on my arrival by the confidence with which Air Vice-Marshal J. F. A. Higgins and the officers under him were confronting the anxieties and difficulties of the time. No one knew what was in the mind of the Turks, and it seemed possible that they intended a regular -invasion of the Mosul Vilayet with ground forces overwhelmingly superior to those at our disposal. This did not shake the serenity and determination of the Air Officer Commanding, who never failed to order action at the decisive moment, but also never failed to bear in mind the restraints imposed upon him by the delicate political situation, restraints which, as is evident from his despatch, often hampered him in the full use of the weapons at his disposal. I desire particularly to bring to the notice of His Majesty&apos;s Government this admirable combination of qualities displayed by the Air Vice-Marshal during the critical operations which he has narrated.3. For the rest I can only endorse the comments of the Air Officer Commanding on these operations. They proved once again the excellence and wonderful preparedness of the Royal Air Force, and its fitness which I have frequently represented for the internal control and the external defence of Iraq, and they showed the stout heartedness and fighting spirit of the Assyrian Levies. It is particularly gratifying that the Air Officer Commanding has recognised the performances of the Iraq Police, who deserve all the praise that he has given them. I trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government may see their way to accept the recommendations of Air Vice-Marshal J. F. A. Higgins for the recognition of the services of those officers and others whom he has mentioned, and I desire to associate myself fully with the remarks which he has made upon them.I have, &amp;c,H. DOBBS,High Commissioner for Iraq.The Right Hon. L. C. M. S. Amery, P.C., M.P., Secretary of State for the Colonies,Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.
