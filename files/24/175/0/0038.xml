192   ITreasury Chambers. S.W.15th October 1925.Dear Monsieur Caillaux,Now that- you have returned from the United States, I should be glad to know when ix would be convenient to you to resume negotiations with a view to the final settlement of the questions leftj outstanding after our last meeting and your acceptance of the figure of  12^ millions.     We have now to conclude a detailed arrangement for funding the&apos;French debt to this country on the basis already agreed, and as Parliament will be meeting again in the middle of November I regard It as important that such an agreement should be completed between our respective Governments in time to be laid before Parliament when it assembles.     I hope that, despite your many preoccupations, you may find it possible to come to London again in person, as I feel sure that this would be the most satisfactory procedure but, should there be insuperable difficulties in your way I trust that you can arrange to send representatives duly authorised to conduct the. negotiations on your behalf.Believe me, my dear Monsieur Caillaux,Yours very sincerely,(Sgd)    WINSTON S CHURCHILL.Son ExcellenceMonsieur &quot;Laillaux,if;I
[This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; .CONFIDENTIAL.The Present Position of the French Debt Negotiations.I.-DEBT TO GREAT BRITAIN. (A.) The Standard Annual Payment.THE discussions were opened on the 24th August with a French proposal of an annual payment for sixty-two years of  10 millions, half of this sum to be dependent upon, and half independent of, French receipts under the Dawes plan. This offer was inacceptable to the British Government, and, on the 25th August, M. Caillaux substituted for it the proposal that France should assume responsibility for the whole annual payment of  10 millions, this offer being, however, subject to certain important conditions described below. New British counter-proposals, subject to Cabinet sanction, were put forward on the same day, ccntaining the figure of  12-^ millions for the standard annuities. The matter came before the Cabinet on the 26th August, when it was decided that sixty-two annuities of  12^ millions on the sole credit of France might be accepted in principle, as governing the debt settlement, or, alternatively, sixty-two annuities of  10 millions on the sole credit of France plus ten points cut cf the fifty-two points which accrue to France out of the receipts for reparation proper under the Dawes plan. (The text of the Cabinet decision is contained in Annex I below.) This final offer was con-veyed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to M. Caillaux, who promised to lay the proposal before his Government. Subsequently M. Caillaux wrote to Mr. Churchill saying that the figure of sixty-two annuities of  12^ millions fixed by the British Government did not give rise to any objection of principle on the part of the French Government (copies of this letter and Mr. Churchill&apos;s reply are contained in Annex II below). This decision on the part of France was announced to the public by Mr. Churchill in a speech at Birmingham on the 16th September. (The relevant parts of this speech are contained in Annex III below.)We therefore regard the question of the normal annual payment as settled.Annex I. Cabinet Decision of August 26, 1925.*The Cabinet agreed That sixty-two annuities of  12^ millions on the sole credit of France might he accepted in principle as governing the debt settlement. They refused categorically to entertain any clause modifying the responsibilities of France in the event of a German default. They were willing, as an alternative, to assent to a settlement on the basis of  10 millions on the sole credit of France and ten points of Dawes.Annex II.Correspondence between Mr. Churchill and M. Caillaux on the Subject of the Acceptance by the FrenchGovernment of an Annuity of  12$ millions. Dear Mr. Churchill, Ministry of Finance.You were good enough, on the 25th August, to send me a personal letter in which it was stated that the British Cabinet reduced to  12  millions the amount of. the annuity which His Majesty&apos;s Government requires to receive for sixty-two years from the French Government in repayment of their debt. In the same letter a slightly different financial arrangement was contemplated worked out in connection with the Dawes plan.I have submitted these views to the Council of Ministers and have the honour to inform you that the figures fixed by the British Government do not give rise to any objection of principle on the part of the French Government.* Handed to M. Caillaux on August 26. [13670j [13698] B
The amount required by the British Government being thus settled, the French Cabinet has no doubt that an agreement both can and should be reached between the two Powers upon the other Questions (essential both in their opinion and in yours) which were discussed between us. You may rest assured that the French Government will leave nothing undone in order to achieve this result.I am, clear Mr. Churchill,Yours very sincerely,J. CAILLAUX.My dear M. Caillaux, September 14, 1925.I am very much obliged &apos;to you for your letter, which I&apos; received on the 5th September, and I am very glad to find that the French and British Governments are now in agreement in principle upon the debt settlement so far as the general basis of figures is concerned. I presume that you have made clear to your colleagues that the figure of  12% millions was only accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Govem-ment on the express condition that the French Government undertook to make payments on this scale as an absolute liability. Subject to this, I shall be quite ready at any time to discuss with you the other essential questions which were left outstanding when you left London. Perhaps you will let me know when it would be convenient to you to resume our conversations.Believe me, dear M. Caillaux,Yours sincerely,WINSTON S. CHUBCH1LL.His Excellency M. Caillaux.Annex III.Extract from Mr. Churchill&apos;s Speech at Birmingham on September 16, 1925M. Caillaux and War Debts.A third example of the mood and policy of the Government is seen in the manner in which we are settling the vexed question of the War Debts. 1 am glad to be able to tell you that I have now received a letter from M. Caillaux informing me that the French Government accept in principle the figure of  12,500,000 as the measure of their obligation to us, subject to the further discussion of various other points, some of which are of considerable importance. Now, the main idea which we have pursued has been settlement. We have not sought to be judged upon this question by our ability to extract the uttermost farthing. We think it our duty to consider not only the capacity of our debtors to pay, but the circumstances&apos; in which these debts were incurred. We believe it also to be in the interests of Britain to promote a general appeasement and revival on the Continent of Europe. It is in our moral interests, it is in our material interests.In taking this line we do not desire in the slightest degree to reflect upon the view and policy of the United States; still less have we the power, even had we.the wish, to prejudice or fetter their sovereign discretion in all matters which affect themselves. I was asked during the summer, by prominent American official personages, whether we should complain if the United States decided to grant more favourable terms to France than had been arranged with Britain. I invariably replied, with the assent of His Majesty&apos;s Government, that a creditor has the right to discriminate between debtors, but that debtors have not the right, in our view, to discriminate between creditors. That, after all, is a simple and wholesome principle, perfectly well understood throughout the whole business world of every country, and nowhere better understood than in the great Republic where business is business, but where sentiment and policy always play their part.These great affairs between nations have to be judged with a historic sense, and with due respect for the majesty of vast organised communities of men and women. To-day the French &apos;Minister, who in a resolute spirit is facing the problems of French finance, starts upon his mission to the United States. I am sure 1 cau say on behalf of this country that we wish him well, and that we hope a good arrangement will be arrived at in accordance with the declared policy of the United States, and also in harmony with the general interests of the whole world, in which the United States, its fortunes and its policy, have become a dominant and, indeed, in some respects, a dominating-factor.(JB.) The Subsidiary Questions.Apart from the actual figure of the standard annuities the following important points were raised during the discussions : (1.) Dependence on Dawes Annuities.M. Caillaux urged that France would not consent to pay over to her allies in settlement of the war debts sums greater than she will receive from Germany by way of reparations. M. Caillaux differentiated between the respective positions of Great Britain and France in this matter by reference to the enormous cost of French reconstruction,  much of which would not be recovered  from   Germany.    He
i 0 i\requested, therefore, that it should be expressly specified that the funding agreement should be modified if the sums received by France under the Dawes plan did not cover French payments in respect of Allied debts. A similar stipulation would be inserted in any French funding agreement with the United States oT America.This claim was categorically refused by the British Cabinet, and has since received a similar reception from the United States Debt Funding Commission.There is reason to believe that the French nation is obstinately set upon this point; and, obviously, it could be used as a means of bringing the whole negotiation to nothing.(2.) Part Passu.In view, especially, of the expressed intention of the French Government to enter into negotiations at an early date for the funding of their war debt to the United States of America, the British Government made it clear throughout that they regarded it as essential that, in the event of any payments being made by the French Government to other creditor Governments on account of war indebtedness, payments not less in amount (due regard being held to the propor-tionate amount of the debts due in each case) shall simultaneously be made to this country.The justice of this demand was not challenged by M. Caillaux.(3.) Gold Deposit.As regards the gold deposited in Great Britain by the Bank of France during the war to the amount of  53-^ millions as guarantee for the war debt, the British Government has made it clear that this gold must be set off against the verv substantial reduction which would be made under their offer in the total of the debt, i.e., that the annuities would be accepted as paying off the net debt after deduction of the value of the gold, and that further payments, altogether outside the debt payments, would have to be made if the French Government wished to redeem the gold.   M. Caillaux has not contested this.(4.) Moratorium.In view of M. Caillaux&apos;s declarations that it was impossible for France^ to pay the full annuities to Great Britain in the early years, having regard especially to their other heavy sterling liabilities during these years, a reduction in the annuities during the first five years (up to and inclusive of 1929) was discussed.The main sterling payments referred to by M. Caillaux are the repayments of a debt, due by the Bank of France to the Bank of England, which, under present arrangements, are as follows :-   millions.1925 (now completed)        ... ... ... 61926 1927 1928 1929 19309 15550Against these repayments the Bank of England has to return gold deposited as security for this debt in the following instalments :   By November 30, 1928       ... ... 3,000,000By November 30, 1929       ... ... 7,000,000By November 30, 1930 ... 8,350,61518,350,615The net debt to the bank is now therefore ( 44 millions- 18,350,000 ^  25,650,000.M. Caillaux asked that the British Government should use its good offices with the Bank of England to secure a modification of this agreement, which would lessen the French liabilities in these early years.   The British Government suggested that [13670] B 2
if such a modification were obtained, the annuities during the first five years should be as follows :   millions.1925 ... ... ... ... . 21926 ... ... ... ... 41927 ... ... ... ... ... 61928 ... ... ... ... ... 81929* ... ... .. ... ... 929In the absence of sucn a modification, the annuities were to be further reduced to the following figures :   millions.1925 .. ... ... ... ... 21926 ... ... ... ... ... 41927 ... ... ... ... ... 41928 ... ... ... ... ... 51929 ... ... ... ... ... 621It was stated that the amounts postponed were to be added to the annuities payable in later years; but no precise arrangement was made upon this point. If the amounts postponed are carried forward with interest, the average annuity after 1980 would have to be increased by  1J millions per annum, or over  1-^ millions per annum, according to the amounts postponed under the two alternative schemes.The proposed scales for the earlier years were accepted by M. Caillaux subject to the condition that no payment should be made out of the French 192&apos;5 budget. He proposed therefore that the payment suggested for 1925 should be postponed to 1926, the 1926 payment to 1927, and so on, the 1929 payment disappearing.This proposal, which reduces the amounts each year and omits the biggest payment ( 9 millions), goes much too far, particularly as France has now in hand as a credit with us  1,250,000, and under the funding arrangement will escape stamp duties, which she now pays to the amount of  350,000 annually.But it should be noted that the French financial year ends on the 31st December, so that a payment in the early part of the French financial year 1926 would be brought into account during the British financial year 1925. Provided therefore that the first payment is made in the beginning of 1926, M. Caillaux&apos;s point could probably be met.It still remains to be seen whether the Bank of England will agree to modify the existing arrangement for the repayment of the money due to it, and the question of the addition of the amounts postponed to the annuities payable in later years also remains outstanding.(5.) Transfer.M. Caillaux asked that if the stability of the franc were endangered by the amounts of the transfers across the exchange which would be necessary under the Funding Agreement, a stipulation should be inserted in the agreement permitting the suspension of the transfers for the period necessary to re-establish the normal situation. The question whether the franc were really in danger might be settled by independent specialist arbitrators.It was indicated that this stipulation in the general form in which it was put forward by M. Caillaux could not be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, since this would leave us entirely dependent on French credit policy, but a counter-proposal was put forward to the effect that any half-yearly payment due after 1935 could, if the franc were in danger, be postponed for not more than a year, the total amount thus postponed not to exceed the amount of one year&apos;s annuity.This counter-proposal was not accepted by M. Caillaux.(6.) Outstanding Accounts.As regards the detailed departmental accounts between the two countries, it was agreed that those relating to the war period would, under the proposed Funding Agreement, be closed. Certain credits are due to France in cash relating to the period after the British Government had ceased to make loans to France.   It had
previously been agreed that these credits, when their amount had been determined, could, up to the 31st March, 1927, be used towards the payment of the French annuities up to an amount of  1,250,000. If the credits exceeded this figure the matter would be further discussed.(7.) British Nationals&apos; War Damages in France.M. Caillaux was urged to give British Empire nationals, whose property was damaged in France during the war and who have received only the compensation terms awarded by the Sumner Commission, compensation benefits analogous to those granted by the French Government to their own nationals. M. Caillaux appeared disposed to accept this and promised to examine it. (The amount of the damages in question is about  1,600,000.)(8.) French Loan on London Market.M. Caillaux asked for an undertaking from the British Government that, if a Funding Agreement were signed, they would give the French Government any assistance in their power, if the latter wished to raise a loan on the London market. In principle, this proposal would not be difficult to accept, but it was pointed out that the feasibility of any French issue would depend cn the judgment of the city, and not on the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.In this connection M. Caillaux was reminded that there was considerable public feeling about British holders of French rentes which had depreciated to one-quarter of their value, and he would probably have to make some arrangement satisfactory to them before any new loan could be successfully floated.(9.) Debt for Stocks.It was agreed that the proposed payments under the Funding Agreement were to be independent of the repayment of the French debt in respect of British surplus stores in France sold after the armistice to the French Government.(The payments still outstanding in respect of this debt are :  March 15, 1926      ... ... ... 1,250,000March 15, 1927      ... ... ... 1,000,000March 15, 1928      ... ... ... 1,250,000March 15, 1929      ... ... ... 1,000,000)(C.) Summary of Position as regards British Debt.To sum up, the present position is that the amount of the standard annuity has been settled in principle at  12-1 millions per annum for a period of sixty-two years (or possibly  10 millions plus 10 points of Dawes).Two questions of the first importance are, however, still outstanding in the French contentions, both unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government:    -(1.) That French payments in respect of Allied debts should not exceed Frenchreceipts from Germany under the Dawes scheme; and (2.) That payments should be postponed in case of danger to the franc.Besides these two main claims, the following questions are still open to discussion : ;(3.) The exact date of payment of the reduced annuities in the earlier years. (4.) The amount of these reduced annuities.   (This depends on the decision ofthe Bank of England as regards modifying the existing agreement.) (5.) The method in which the amounts by which the earlier annuities would bereduced are to be added to the later annuities. (6.) The question of the British Empire nationals whose property was damaged in France during the war.
II. DEBT TO UNITED STATES OP AMERICA. (A.) M. Caillaxjx&apos;s Negotiations at Washington. 11 THE original capital of the French War Debt to the United States of America was 2,933 million dollars (, 604 millions). With accrued interest at 5 per cent., it now totals about 3,800 million dollars ( 782 millions). In addition, the French Government owes a further debt of 407 million dollars ( 84 millions) for surplus stores taken over after the war on which interest at 5 per cent, has been regularly paid, and the capital is repayable in 1929. During the negotiations in Washington the Debt Funding Commission offered two concessions in regard to the calculation of the debt, viz.: (1.) They offered to recalculate *fche back interest on the war debt at a lower rate, reducing the charge in respect of interest by 200 million dollars ( 41^ millions).(2.) They offered to incorporate the debt for surplus stores with the war debt and to fund both debts together, thus relieving Prance of the heavy maturity for war stores in 1929.The effect of these concessions is to make the total net debt of Prance to the United States of America 4,025 million dollars ( 832 millions) as against the total net debt of France to Great Britain of  580 millions.2. The maximum French offer was to pay annuities for 68 years of the following amounts :- 8 millions for 5 years (1926-30).  12 7    ,,   (1931-37). 20 56    ,,   (1938-93).Against this, the Debt Funding Commission proposed annuities for 62 years on the following scale :  8 millions a year in 1926, rising by stages (probably  2 millions each year) toa standard annuity of  32 millions a year in 1938.  32 millions to continue for 49 years, i.e., 1939-1987.To the French offers were attached &quot; important conditions which render the payments entirely uncertain.&quot; These are understood to have included (a) a &quot;safeguard&quot; clause enabling France to claim a revision of the agreement if at anytime she considered the burden excessive (e.g., in the event of a breakdown of German reparations), and (o) power to suspend payment for 2 years during the first 5 years, and for 3 years during the remainder of the period.Finally, as no agreement could be reached on a permanent funding scheme, the Debt Commission proposed a provisional arrangement under which France should pay  8^- millions a year for 5 years to be considered as full Current interest on the debt.   The proposal was subject to the approval of Congress.(B.) Reaction on French Debt to Great Britain.The rejected French offer is equivalent to a standard Annuity of  16,715,000 on the American Debt of  832 millions, or 2&apos;1 per cent. The Net French Debt to His Majesty&apos;s Government (as on the 1st October, 1925), is about  580 millions, and the equivalent standard annuity would therefore be  12,180,000.The United States of America proposal is approximately equivalent to a standard annuity of 4 per cent, after the twelfth year. The equivalent annuity on the British Debt (after the twelfth year) would therefore be about  23 millions.The final interim proposal of  81 millions a year represents 1 per cent, on the Debt. This corresponds closely with the scale which we proposed for the first payments on the French War Debt to us.   Our scale was:   millions.1925   .... .... .... .... .... ....   21926 1927 1928 192946i.e., a total of  29 millions spread over five years or an average annuity of  5,800,000, which represents 1 per cent, on a net Debt of  580 millions.   But
whereas we proposed a graduated scale, the United States of America proposal is a constant annuity of 1 per cent., i.e., we might demand a flat  5,800,000 a year instead of a graduated scale.Thus, if the interim arrangement with the United States of America is compared with the terms we proposed, it should not cause us any embarrassment. But logically there is no analogy as the payments we proposed represent part of a permanent settlement, covering capital and interest on the French Debt to us, whereas the United States of America arrangement is a provisional settlement of interest alone during the next few years, the whole capital of the Debt remaining intact and the United States of America being free to recover it in full after 1930.Some detailed comparisons between the French Debts to the United States of America and to Great Britain were made by the Debt Funding Commissions and are dealt with in the Appendix below.APPENDIX.Special Categories of French Debt to United States of America.1. THE French may argue that the Debt to the United States of America consists of (a)  80 millions for Surplus War Material (a Commercial Debt) and (b)  720 millions for War Debt Proper. On the Debt of  80 millions they have always paid interest in cash at 5 per cent., i.e.,  4 millions, so it might be argued that the portion of their proposed provisional annuity applicable to War Debt is only (8-4)  4 millions. This would represent about \ per cent, on the capital, so that they would on this argument really be paying America \ per cent, on War Debt while they pay us 1 per cent.It is, however, very unlikely that the French will use this argument; the Americans offered to consolidate the Debt for Surplus War Material ( 80 millions) with the rest of the Debt. This offer is most important to France, as at present they are paying 5 per cent, interest in cash on the Surplus War Material Debt and are liable to repay the principal in 1929. Should the French raise this point it would thus be sufficient to point out that the Funding Commission offered to consolidate the Debts and that M. Caillaux noted the offer, and to ask whether the French themselves regard this debt of  80 millions as being still a separate &quot; Commercial Debt.&quot;2. The French might go even further. The Funding Commission argued that the amount of  136 millions included in the French Debt to the United States of America, which is regarded as representing support of the franc and material commercial obligations, is a commercial debt exactly analogous to the Loan of  72 millions by the Bank of England to the Bank of France. If the French were to accept this argument (which it would clearly be very dangerous for them to do), they might say that this Debt can be regarded as carrying interest at 5 per cent. (i.e:,  6^- millions a year), so that the interest on Commercial Debts (Surplus War Material and Support of the Franc) would alone require (4 -\- 6-g-)  10J millions, leaving for War Debt proper nothing (or a minus quantity) out of the provisional annuity of  8 millions.But the argument of the Funding Commission seems in no way well founded, since (a) the Bank of England Loan was a non-governmental and commercial transaction strictly analogous to French Market loans in the United States of America; and (6) both the British and the American Loans to France during the War covered expenditure on support of the franc and commercial obligations, and there is therefore no reason to treat the British Loans as wholly War Debt and the American Loans as partly Commercial Debt.
