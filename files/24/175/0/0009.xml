CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,    Copy No.    30CP. 409 (25).CABINET.AIRSHIP POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary op State foe Air.IN accordance with the Prime Ministers instruction of the 10th March, I have had prepared in the Air Ministry the attached analysis of the proposals of the &quot; Airship Guarantee Company &quot; of the 5th March. It will be remembered that the First Lord of the Admiralty at the end of January circulated to the Cabinet a paper upon airship policy (O.P.-40 (25)), and that a fortnight afterwards I put my own views -before my colleagues in OP.-84 (25). A careful investigation of Commander Burney&apos;s new proposals only confirms the conclusions that I stated in my previous memorandum. Indeed, the considerations of technical caution and financial economy that I then urged receive upon certain salient points less attention in the new scheme than they received in the scheme of 1923.The attached analysis shows that the new proposals are founded upon a series of optimistic and untested assumptions. Commander Burney asserts that his new design will enable airships greatly to increase their speed and to dispense, for the present, at all events, with shed bases outside England. These assertions are little more than guesses, since they have not been substantiated by full-scale experiments and most of the essential data on which calculations must be based have still to be obtained. Moreover, it should be remembered that during the last five years almost all Commander Burney&apos;s assertions and estimates have been repeatedly modified. Whilst, however, from the technical point of view Commander Burney is guessing, from the financial point of view he is taking little or no risk. The Government is to undertake a commitment of  4,000,000,  2,000,000 of which is to become payable upon the completion of a single flight to Australia and back. Further, Commander Burney assumes that Australia, New Zealand and Ceylon will subscribe an additional  1,300,000 to the scheme. There appears to be no evidence for this assumption, whilst the failure to carry it into effect would either entail a corresponding increase in our commitment of  4,000,000 or would entirely destroy the financial calculations on which these proposals are based.In short, over and above the incidental expenditure which is to be met from public funds including the cost of constructing the first airship the company is to receive some  3,000,000 in cash if a single flight to Australia is successfully accom-plished, whilst, apart from any inconsiderable commitments which they may have incurred under the terms of their existing contract, they will lose not a single penny if it fails.In the field of research Commander Burney, ignoring the lessons of the past, desires to cut down still further the exiguous expenditure upon which we attempted to insist in 1923.For these reasons, then,, technical and financial, I have come to the emphatic conclusion that the new proposals should not be entertained. We have already made distinct progress with the present experimental stage. Commitments amounting to over  700,000 have been entered upon, and we are well advanced on an exhaustive programme of research, both theoretical and practical, which should result, in a comparatively short time, in the accumulation of sufficient data for making a fair and economical contract with one or more commercial companies. I am as anxious as anyone to see commercial airship lines inaugurated and a continuous policy of airship progress developed. In the interests both of safety and of economy we must, however, proceed with caution. On the one hand, we must do everything in our power to avoid another airship disaster, whilst, on the other, we have no right to involve the country in a monopoly contract of several millions when in a comparatively short time we may have the data for obtaining cheaper and less onerous contracts not with one but with several companies.S. H.,Air Ministry, May 1925. Secretary of State for Air.[13133] [13592]b
2Memorandum by the Air Ministry ox the Airship Guarantee Company^Proposals oe March 5, 1925.1. The company&apos;s letter assigns three reasons in favour of the adoption of &quot; a definite policy for the development of British commercial airships .... in place of the present limited programme,&quot; viz. : (a.) That it is desirable to alter the sites of the bases in Egypt and India in viewof the increased range of the company&apos;s airship. (b.) That it is desirable&apos;to enable commercial interests to negotiate with theDominion Governments (presumably for the capital advances and subsidypayments proposed in the scheme), (c.) That their new proposals (substituting Australia and New Zealand for India)can be adopted by the British Government for an expenditure of  800,000less than was contemplated by the &quot; Burney Scheme &quot; of 1923.It will probably be convenient to deal with these points in order.(a.) Proposal to alter Sites of Bases in Egypt and India.2. This proposal is, of course, linked up with the proposed substitution of Australia and New Zealand for India, as the terminal points of the first experimental flight and proposed airship service. Both proposals are based on the company&apos;s new developments and inventions with regard to mooring masts and airship design, which they &quot;anticipate&quot; will approximately double the radius of flight of their airship at 70 m.p.h.   It is therefore of importance to examine the grounds for this anticipation.3. The company&apos;s claim with regard to their mast is that it will admit of the control car being placed in the extreme nose of the airship -which is hardly practicable with the Air Ministry type of mast and that this arrangement will greatly reduce the airship&apos;s head resistance. This claim is in any case somewhat weakened by a recent statement by Commander Burney in response to criticisms of this feature^) that &quot; there will be a secondary control position in the usual position.&quot; But this is of small importance in comparison with the fact that the eompany&apos;s mast is still only in the design stage, never having yet been constructed in full scale or tested out in any way.(a) The experience of the Air Ministry goes to show that, however careful the preliminary work of design, it is extremely difficult to guarantee the precise performance of an aircraft, aero engine or other aircraft eqtiipment until the apparatus has been thoroughly tried out in full scale. The company&apos;s anticipations may be realised it would be unwise to assume that they will be.4. In any case the mooring mast and the location of the control car are only of secondary importance in determining the speed and range of an airship ; ultimately these depend on the all-round efficiency of the engine and on the shape of the hull complete with passenger and power cars. As regards the engine, the company stated on the 22nd April, 1925, that the first (experimental) engine was then on test. Consequently, for the reasons given above with regard to the mooring mast, it is impossible at this stage to make any precise calculation as to horse-power, weight, propeller efficiency and fuel consumption for the final form. As regards the airship, certain preliminary tests have been carried out in the wind tunnels&quot; at the National Physical Laboratory on a model with excrescences intended to represent the power cars, &amp;c. It is, however, impossible accurately to predict from these tests the speed and range of the airship even for known horse-power without (a) a knowledge of the precise allowance to be made for the difference between model and full scale ; (6) the certainty that this preliminary model does in fact represent in every detail the airship as she will be finally constructed in full scale, and (c) a knowledge of the precise weight of the total structure.5. Owing to the paucity of data on the subject, there is considerable doubt as to the allowance to be made for (a) viz., scale effect, and the main object of the trials with R 33 was to elucidate this point. These trials, however, the company propose to dispense with. As to the second and third points, construction of the airship has not yet commenced. Consequently, it cannot be said that either condition (b) or (c) has been complied with.   In short, as in the case of the mooring mast and the engine,(!) In replying to questions arising- out of a paper read by him to the Institution of Aeronautical Engineers on the 24th April, 1925.(2) Its theoretical merits are now being examined by the Airhips Co-ordinating Sub-Committee of the Aeronautical Besearch Committee before the question of carrying out full-scale trials is decided upon.
there are not, and cannot be at the present stage, sufficient data on which to predict, eighteen months or two years in advance, what will be the actual performance of the finished airship. It follows that the tacit substitution of Australia-New Zealand for India ought not to be accepted. Even if the company&apos;s anticipations are fully realised it is far better for the airship to have a margin with which to carry out her first experimental flight than to prescribe an experimental flight which she will only be able to accomplish under the most favourable circumstances.ti. If India remains the terminus for the first experimental flight, the arguments for Colombo and Baghdad lose much of their force; but it should be pointed out that, even if a service to Australia and New Zealand is to be the final goal, there are serious objections to the selection of Baghdad and Colombo as stopping-places at this stage. If a. service to Australia is to be profitable, it must cater for the maximum number of mails and passengers. Any transport system must be based on the great centres of popula-tion, and its stopping-places must be determined by the volume of traffic to be obtained rather than by the mere length of each stage. From this point of view the superiority of Ismailia and Karachi over Baghdad and Colombo does not admit of argument. It should be added that Ismailia and Karachi are also preferable on strategical grounds.(b.) That Commercial Interests should be put in a position to negotiate with Dominion Governments.7. The time for negotiation with Dominion Governments will be when the first experimental stage is completed, or at all events nearing completion, i.e., when some definite experience of airship navigation in the tropics has been obtained, and the practicability of a service to Australia and New Zealand has been demonstrated. The hastening of such negotiation is not in itself an argument for upsetting the scheme of development now in force.(c.) That the New Proposals would cost the British Government  800,000 less than the original Burney Scheme.8. It seems clear that the acceptance of these proposals would place the Airship G-uarantee Company in at least as good a position as they would have occupied if the original scheme had been signed. On the other hand, whilst the capital advances and subsidy payments now proposed from the British Government amount to  4,000,000 instead of  4,800,000, it would appear from the outline submitted that the new proposals involve a heavier financial risk to the Government than the original scheme.(3) ^ .9. Under the 1923 scheme  400,000 was to be advanced for the first stage, which covered the carrying out of a technical programme of research and experiment, the building of a 5,000,000 cubic feet airship, and the performance of a successful flight to India.  1,200,000 was then to become payable by instalments on completion of the flight to India, and a further  1,200,000 on the establishment of a weekly service to India.10. Under the scheme now submitted by Commander Burney the Government, after paying for the construction of the airship under the existing contract,(4) fitting out two monitors with the company&apos;s (untried) type of mooring mast, and incurring other expenditure,(5) is liable for payment of  2,000,000 on completion of a single flight to Australia and back. One stage is thus substituted for two, and the whole sum is payable without any experience of the regular working of an airship line.11. Moreover, although the total which would have been payable by the Govern-ment at the second and third stages of the 1923 scheme is reduced from  2,400,000 to  2,000,000, the scheme is contingent on the subscription of another  1,300,000 by dominions and colonies. Such subscriptions are very unlikely to be forthcoming without further experience of airship working than the success of a single flight to Australia, and the arrangement would be awkward financially. If the company fails, and if airships are still required for military purposes, the British Government would have to pay the dominions for the assets taken over. If the company succeeds, the rate of repayment will be slower.12. The operating company will have a capital of  1,000,000 in shares and  3,300,000 in debentures, giving available funds of  4,300,000 less, say,  434,000 for the. ship mooring masts and gas plants, and 1  150,000 paid to the Airship Guarantee (3) See Appendix II, g$ 1-5.(*) If the voyage to Australia and back is successful  300,000 of this is recoverable. (E) For details see Appendix II, gS 1-2.[13592] b 2
Company for Howden. . No details are given of the way in which this  3,716,000 is to be expended or of the bases and mooring masts which are to be built. Similarly, subsidies amounting in all to  437,500 per annum for the service to New Zealand are .proposed, but no particulars are given as to the frequency of the service for which the subsidies are to be paid.13. Under the 1923 scheme the Government was to pay for the user of airships, sheds, mooring masts, &amp;c, owned by the company if and when required, although these would in fact have been constructed and acquired very largely with Government money.   The same condition would, presumably, be applied under the new proposals.14. As regards existing bases, the demand for Pulham as well as Cardington is dropped, and a twenty-one years&apos; lease of Cardington, presumably at a fair rent, is suggested ; but in all other respects the scheme compares unfavourably both with the .1923 scheme and the existing Government scheme.15. Under these proposals, while the company secure nearly  3,000,000 in cash if the flight is successful, they lose not a single penny if it fails, apart from any risk which may be incurred on their existing contract, which is quite independent of their present proposals. They are paid for the ship, the crew, the expenses of the trial flights, and the monitors and masts are provided at Government expense. Under the 1 923 scheme the company undertook a certain financial risk in the early stages and were to that extent justified in demanding a high reward ; under the 1925 proposal this financial risk is eliminated, but their financial demands are increased.16. The financial advantage of the existing Air Ministry scheme is that, after the practicability of the 5,000,000 cubic feet ship has been demonstrated, the Government has a free hand to negotiate terms for an airship service with any group of financiers, and the terms which could then be obtained should be far better than at the present stage. Moreover, the Government will own the airships, sheds and bases constructed during the experimental stage and will be able to recover its expenditure if they are transferred or leased to private companies.(d.) Technical Aspect of the Proposals.17. When the original scheme was approved in principle its technical details were not formulated, although Commander Burney was asked to submit a technical programme. Indeed, when the contract was being negotiated, he displayed great unwillingness to submit such a programme, and the Air Ministry came to the conclusion that the scheme as he intended to cany it out would be open to serious technical objections. There were clear indications of a tendency to economise on research and experiment, to rely optimistically on untried expedients, and to incur considerable risks in the hope that if all went well the single voyage to India might be performed, and thus entitle the company to the large payments then due.18. In the present proposals there is no attempt to disguise this attitude, and the company make it clear that the Air Ministry&apos;s previous apprehensions were fully justified.   The main points of technical criticism are as follows : (i.) The whole scheme is made to depend on &quot; anticipations &quot; with regard to the company^s mast and airship, which may or may not be realised, but which certainly cannot be in any way guaranteed.(ii.) The company consider that the results obtained in the aerodynamic trials of R. 33 will be of academic interest only, and apparently do not intend to carry them out. They thus ignore the report of the Accidents Investigations Sub-Committee on the R. 38 disaster, which states that research by both model and full scale experiment is essential to determine and verify the forces to which, an airship w subjected.(iii.J The company deprecate the idea of sending .R. 33 (6) to Egypt for tropical trials on the grounds that they have sufficient information for the production of both gas-bags and outer covers from the Zeppelin Company. But this information is only theoretical and tropical fabric trials are essential. The trials will include flying and mooring mast trials, and will give us essential experience in the management of an airship under tropical conditions, both in flight and at the mast.(iv.) The company propose an experimental flight from England to Australia or New Zealand, a distance of 9,340 miles (to Fremantle), or 12,880 miles (to Wellington), of which the first stage will be to Colombo, a distance of(6) The original inteutiori was to send K. S3; later R. 36 was to have been sent, E. 33 remaining at home ; but whichever airship is sent she will be thoroughly reconditioned for the purpose.
55,750 miles. The Air Ministry proposal is for an experimental flight to Karachi of 4,830 miles, which will be done in two stages, the longest of which is 2,530 miles. It is clear that the company&apos;s proposal reduces the chances of success without any corresponding advantage, as a flight to India will prove all that is wanted for the first experimental stage, (v.) The recent accident to R. 33 proves clearly (as the Air Ministry have always maintained) that a seriously damaged airship may be able to return to her base or reach her destination if within reasonable range ; but that if sheds for repair are not there available she will become a total loss. Consequently, the Air Ministry scheme provides two sheds, one in England and one at Karachi, for the 4,830 miles to India, so that the airship will always be within easy range of shed repair facilities. The company, on the other hand, propose to have only one shed, and that in England, for the flight of 9,340 miles to Australia, or 12,880 miles to New Zealand, (vi.) Although the retention of Pulham by the Government would enable operations with existing ships to proceed, the lease of Cardington to- the company would deprive the Government of valuable technical experience, and make it dependent entirely on the company for large repairs and reconditioning.(vii.) The Government ship is apparently not to be built until after the company&apos;s ship, so that the experimental flight will be made with one ship instead of two, thus halving the chance of success.(viii.) To maintain the service to New Zealand the company apparently propose to maintain only the same number of ships as they contemplated for the service to India, although the distance is more than twice as great.SUMMARY.19. The view of the Air Ministry with regard to the scheme as a whole may be summarised as follows: (i.) The proposed substitution of New Zealand for India rests on anticipations with regard to the success of the Company&apos;s mooring mast, engine and airship. None of these are, however, at present in a sufficiently advanced stage for their final performance to be predicted accurately. In these uncertain circumstances, it would be most unwise to upset a considered scheme which is already in operation.(ii.) Even granted New Zealand as the ultimate goal, Karachi and Ismailia would still be preferable as stopping places to Colombo and Baghdad on the score of traffic and strategical considerations, (iii.) Financially, the scheme is one-sided. The Company are to accept no financial risk in the first stage, but on its successful accomplishment will become entitled to much larger capital advances and subsidy payments than under the old scheme, as the Dominion Governments are now to contribute. So far as the British Government is concerned, although the capital and subsidy payments are slightly less, the financial risk is greater than in the 1923 scheme. (iY.) Whilst the payments to be made are accurately specified the work to be done by the Company in return for them is left extremely vague.(v.) On the research side, the scheme is less acceptable than the 1923 scheme, as this contained provision for the carrying out of a technical programme of research and experiment. The Company now propose to undertake none of the research and experiment which are essential preliminaries to the construction of a 5,000,000 cubic feet airship and her navigation in the tropics. [13592] B 3
(vi.) Qn the. operational side, the Company propose to incur the maximum risk by providing one airship instead of two for the experimental flight; by extending the length of the flight and of the individual stages; by relying on an untried type of mast which is to be placed in a vessel instead of on land; and by omitting to provide a shed at any point outside the United Kingdom.A brief comparison of the present proposals with those put forward by the company in 1923 is annexed as Appendix I, whilst Appendix 11 contains an analysis of the financial provisions now proposed.APPENDIX I.Comparison between 1923 and 1925 Schemes.1923.Financial.1925.1. Stage I.The company found  200,000 (or if required  300,000).The Government found  400,000.2. Stages II and III.The capital advances and fee payments in Stage III could not be earned until Stage II had been carried out by the performance of a regular weekly service to India for three months.In both stages the payments were related to the performance of a service of a specified frequency.3. Total Gash Liability.The total liability of the British Govern-ment for capital advances and subsidy payments was  4,800,000.1. Stage I.The company find no new money.(7)The Government are liable for an expenditure of approximately  914,000.(s)2. Stages II and 111.Once the first experimental flight to New Zealand and back has been per-formed, the company become immediately entitled to capital advances and fee pay-ments for fifteen years.The company refrain from specifying in their proposals the frequency or other conditions of the service to which these payments are to be related.3. Total Cash Liability.The total of capital and subsidy pay-ments lias been reduced to  4,000,000, but as pointed out above there are additional liabilities amounting to  914,000, of which  434,000 is recoverable, leaving a net total liability of about  4,500,000.&quot;In addition, capital advances and sub-sidy payments are now asked for from the Dominion and Colonial Governments amounting to  2,800,000.Technical.agreement4. Provision for Research.The  provisional   heads  of stipulated that the company should (a.)

The estate included 1,520 acres of land, of which the purchaser sold 660 acres for  11,240 by auction very soon after signature of the contract with the Disposal Commission. It is therefore unlikely that the balance of the property cost the company anything approaching  150,000.(13) It will be remembered that under the existing contract the Government made a grant of  50,000 to the Airship Guarantee Company over and above the price of the ship ( 300,000).(u) This  300,000 has already been shown as possibly recoverable.6.
