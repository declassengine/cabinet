SCOTTISH SI10N.ls      The Secretary for Scotland reported that with reference to the offer of a special subsidy of  40 in Scotland for 4,000 houses to be constructed by alternative methods he had had a conference with representatives of .Scottish Local Authorities.     A Sub-Committee had there-after been appointed to endeavour Inter alia to find a solution of the difficulty which had arison in Mid-Lanark in connection with the erection of Weir houses.     He had now received a report from the Sub-Committee to the effect that the Sub-Committee had failed to bring about an agreement between Messrs. Weir and the building trade operatives who had stated quite frankly that any local authority ordering Weir houses would do so at their own risk of a stoppage similar to that in Mid-Lanark.COMMSNDA&apos; INS.24 The Conference unanimously recommend to the Cabinet that  ;-(i) having regard to the housing shortage-,the cost of houses, unemployment position, etc,  it Is necessary to fight the building trades on the question of alternative methods of house building.(ii) the approval of firms prepared to erect houses under the special subsidy scheme should be limited to the following four, viz:-Corolite Construction Company, Ltd.s Cowiesons,  Ltd,, Glasgow, James Jones and Son,  Ltd.,  Larbert, G. &amp; J. Weir, Glasgowpand that a limited price should be fixed less than the prices which the Scottish Board of Health are prepared to approve for brick houses of a similar type.(iii) at least 1,000 houses should in any event be ordered from Lord Weir,  if not by local authorities then by the Scottish Board of Health working preferably through a Public Utility Society.
(iv) the Treasury should envisage theprovision of the balance of capital required for the construction of 1,000 houses  (sav,   150,000)  over and above the sum (say,   300,000) which would be borrowed by the Public Utilitv Society from the Public Works Loan Board and the making of such other financial arrangements as may be necessary in the circumstances.(v) the   Scottish Board of Health in its communications with local authorities should be guided by the above recommendations ons .(vi)  The above conclusions to be subject to the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer who was unavoidably absent.COMPARISON 3.
