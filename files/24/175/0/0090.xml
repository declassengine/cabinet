SECRET.Copy No. &quot;XjCP. 490 (25).CABINET.[Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.]DEVELOPMENT IN BRITISH TERRITORY IN WEST AFRICA.ON the 15th October I circulated to my colleagues a memorandum CP. 434 (25) in connection with an East African Development Loan. In that memorandum I outlined projected developments which would be assisted by a loan guaranteed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.I now circulate to my colleagues, for information, a statement of the development actually in progress, or in immediate contemplation, in West Africa. My primary object in doing so is to indicate what volume of orders for West Africa may be expected to be placed with manufacturers in this country in the near future.In Nigeria the following large works are in construction or have been authorised: 1. Eastern Railway.Eastern Railway now nearing completion. The amount of rails required for future work is nil and the rolling-stock will depend on traffic, no estimate can be given of the number of engines or trucks which will be needed, but it cannot be great, as the line is taken into service in sections and the rolling-stock ordered gradually as the demand increases.Of this expenditure about 45 per cent, represents the value of goods ordered in England, say, , 2,700,000.2. Branch Railway.Branch railway from Zaria north-west to Gusau, where the British Cotton Growing Association recently established a ginnery. This line, which has just been sanctioned and will be 114 miles in length, will tap one of the best cotton-growing areas in Nigeria. Its cost is estimated as not exceeding  627,000. Bridges and culverts will cost about  71,000 and telegraph material about  20,000. About 62 miles of old rails and sleepers, available owing to relaying of the main lines with heavier rails, will be used on the branch. Probably another 52 miles of main line (Kaduna-Zaria) will be relaid with new 60-lb. rails at a cost of  127,000 for material and the old rails used on the branch. The alternative is to purchase 52 miles of lighter rails for the branch.   In any case about 52 miles ofL. S. A.Colonial Office, November 27, 1925.(A.) NIGERIA.Works in Progress or Authorised.Total cost was originally estimated Later revised to expenditure up to the 31st March, 1925 Expenditure in 1925-6 .... 6,831,000 5,994,485 4,351,755 1,001,730[13858]
new rails will be required for use either on the main line or on the Gusau branch. Surveys of routes for other possible branch lines, both in the northern and southern provinces, are being carried on. These are combined traffic and engineering reconnaissance surveys to enable estimates to be formed, not only of cost of construction, but of the probable receipts and expenditures of the lines when working.3. Lagos Harbour.&quot;Wharves with large double-storied transit sheds alongside at Apapa. Total cost  876,250. The work is rather more than half completed, payments having been made to the amount of  458,100 to the contractors, Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth&quot; and Co. The work will not be complete at any rate until the middle of 1926. The amount which will have to be spent in the United Kingdom will be about 15 per cent, of the total, or  130,000. This is a stone and concrete wharf. Approval has been given for the purchase of a floating crane for Lagos Harbour. This will cost about  20,000, delivered in Lagos.4. Port Harcourt Harbour.The development of Port Harcourt as a harbour began just before the outbreak of war, but work had to be suspended and was resumed. The wharfage scheme is in instalments. The first costing  430,000 has been completed, about 75 per cent, having been spent in this country. A second instalment of wharf costing  249,000 has been sanctioned and is in progress. The consulting engineers estimate that  135,000 of this will represent the cost of materials from England, it being a steel screw pile erection.In order to allow of the better handling of coal for export a proposal has been approved for the construction of a coal bin and conveyors in addition to the present coal tip. The port can at present handle about 200,000 tons a year, and with the new bin it is hoped to increase the output considerably. The cost of this is  56,000, of which  14,500 represents machinery to be ordered from Great Britain. In addition, a proposal has been approved to construct an electric power station at a total cost of  45,000, of which  31,000 represents material from the United Kingdom. This would light the town, and provide power for the coal conveyors and for electric cranes.A further proposal for dredging and reclamation work is under consideration. If agreed to it will involve spending  186,000 on a new dredger, barges and pumping vessel.5. Water Supplies.Provision of adequate water supplies involves expenditure on pipes and fittings. A scheme for Kano estimated to cost between  200,000 and  250,000 has been prepared, but there is difficulty in deciding the most suitable source, and the expenditure in this country cannot be estimated until the site is settled.6. Road Programme.The road programme involves mainly local expenditure, but good roads stimulate motor traffic. Nigeria now has 2,500 miles of motor road maintained by Government apart from the roads maintained by the native authorities.7. Railway Rolling Stoch.Since the war considerable additions have been made to the locomotives and rolling-stock ; and large workshops have been built at Ebute Metta and Enugu to enable repairs and carriage and wagon construction to be carried out efficiently and promptly. Twelve new locomotives were ordered in July at a cost of  68,880, delivered in Liverpool. The stud of engines will then number 206, but some of these are nearly obsolete and will require replacing. The new engines are larger and more powerful than those previously in service and can handle much heavier loads.Note.It is not possible to give accurate figures as to the amounts to be spent in the United Kingdom on various constructions without reference to the colony.
In the case of a harbour works, much depends on the method of construction. At Apapa the new wharf is stone and concrete and only 15 per cent, of the cost will be spent here. At Port Harcourt the first part of the wharf scheme was steel screw piling and 75 per cent, was spent here. The second paru now under construction is also steel piling, and  135,000 out of the total of  249,000 will be spent on materials.With a railway much depends on the kind of country and the amount of bridging. If there are a lot of bridges the percentage in this country goes up. If there is a lot of heavy cutting and banking it goes down. In Nigeria there is never much bridging and not many heavy earthworks. The cost of goods from this country for a tropical African railway varies from about 43 per cent, to 50 per cent, of the total. In Nigeria it can be put at the lower figure for approximate purposes.(B.) GOLD COAST.Harbours.The deep-water harbour at Takoradi is estimated to cost  3,066,000, of which amount about half has already been spent. A very small proportion of this expenditure will be made outside the colony, probably not more than 15 per cent., as all the stone for the breakwater is obtainable locally and most of the excavating plant has already been acquired. 100,000 has been spent on improvements to the harbour at Accra. There only remains a small proportion of this expenditure still to be made.Railways.Since the war the Sekondi-Kumasi Railway has been linked to the Accra line by the Tafo-Kumasi Railway, which cost  2,128,185.The line from Sekondi to Kumasi has been re-aligned throughout. Sekondi to Obusai cost  1,673,250, and work is approaching completion on the last section (Obuasi-Kumasi), which is estimated to cost  141,000.The substitution of 80-lb. for 50-lb. rails on the last sector of the Sekondi-Kumasi line, namely, Obuasi to Kumasi, will be carried out as soon as the existing track wears out. This is estimated to cost  205,000, of which approximately  150,000 would be cost of rails and material.The Central Province Railway (from the Huni Valley to Kade) is now under construction. The total cost will be  1,320,000, of which about 44 per cent, is estimated to be spent outside the colony. About  900,000 has already been spent, the work being more than half complete. Of the total, about  150,000 is to be spent on rolling-stock in this country, of which  100,000 has already been spent.A route is being surveyed in the Northern Territories for a railway running north from Kumasi. It is extremely unlikely, however, that the amount of traffic would justify the construction of a railway at the present time, and the survey is only being undertaken with a view to eventual developments. It might be taken that any railway which was constructed wrould not cost, per mile, much below the Central Province Railway. If the railway were to go as far as Tamale it would be not less than 200 miles long, i.e., the cost would be roughly  2,000,000, of which 45 per cent, might be estimated to be spent outside the colony. These figures are, of course, entirely speculative and the preliminary surveys will take two years. 112,582 has been spent on new rolling-stock in the past five years.  60,000 is being spent during the current year on terminal facilities for new railways at Sekondi. A good proportion of this should be spent in this country, as it is largely for workshops and machinery.Motor Roads.The programme of road development is estimated to cost  1,185,000 in the period 1920-30. Expenditure will be roughly at the rate of  100,000 a year for the period 1926-30. This will involve some expenditure in this country on motor-rollers estimated at  13,000 in all, and for machinery estimated at  10,000 in all.Water Supply.About  280,000 is estimated to be spent in provision of water supplies in the period 1920-30.   Of this about  115,000 has already been spent.A certain proportion of the remainder would be spent in this country.
Town Improvements.36880,000 is estimated to be spent in the period 1920-30. Of this, approximately  500,000 remains to be spent. This covers certain expenditure on sanitary structures and sewage pipes, but the bulk of the expenditure would be on labour.Electric Works. 201,000 is estimated to be spent in the ten years, 1920-30, on provision of electric light for Accra and Kumasi and other places. The Accra installation is now complete, but  40,000 remains to be spent on the installation at Kumasi, of which about 66 per cent, would be spent out of the colony.Public Buildings.The main buildings undertaken by the Government are the Gold Coast Hospital at Accra, which is nearly complete and cost about  250,000, and Achimota College and the Prince of Wales School which are estimated to cost about  500,000. The hospital will be cemplete by the end of the current year, but the construction of Achimota College and the Prince of Wales School will probably take until 1928. It is not possible to state exactly how much of this expenditure will be spent in this country, but cement, steel-work and fittings will be required costing, say, 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, of the total amount.J&apos;cave and Telegraphs. 375,000 is estimated to be spent in the period 1920-30. Of this, about  30,000 will remain to be spent in 1926-7.  88,000 is being spent this year, of which a considerable percentage should be on wire and equipment.(C.) SIERRA LEONE.A programme for the expenditure of the surplus funds ( 400,000) for the next three years has been approved. It includes very little which would require expenditure in this country, perhaps  30,000 for building materials mainly.The colony is not in a position to raise a loan. If His Majesty&apos;s Government would make a loan without interest repayable in instalments beginning, say, seven years hence, the colony could probably spend it to advantage on steel bridges and an export wharf.Colonial Office, November 26, 1925.aO
