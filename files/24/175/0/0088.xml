This being so, was it possible for the Committee to say that inevitably in practice or politically, the repercussions on other industries of a duty on steel would be so serious that the Government ought at this stage to refuse to grant an enquiry ?On this question there were really two entirely separate sets of considerations to be weighed. There was at once a practical and a political issue. As regards the former, he was surprised that the evidence laid before the Committee had not been stronger on the question of the practical effect on the steel using industries of a duty on steel.
(a.) Ship Building.The evidence showed that in any case British shipbuilders could not avoid using approximately 50 per cent, of British steel. This being so, it was possible to argue that a duty on foreign steel would not greatly affect them, as their British made steel would cost less, though their foreign steel would cost more. However this might be, he believed that if there was a duty, it was essential that there should be a complete drawback on all ship building material unless, during the discussion at the Safeguarding enquiry the steel industry and the ship building industry were to reach definite agreement in regard to prices.(b.) Re-Rollers.He had not been impressed by the evidence of the Chairman of the Re-Rollers&apos; Association, and he was strengthened in this view by the fact that the Association had formally notified the Board of Trade of their opposition to the duty without having consulted their members, some of whom were known strongly to oppose such an attitude. It appeared that in the Re-Rolling Industry, foreign competition in the finished article was not so keen that the industry could not maintain itself, even if it were required to pay more for its raw material. Moreover, some Re-Rollers took the attitude that in order to maintain the basis of the industry in this country it was essential to use a pro-portion of British steel. On the whole, it was probable that, if an enquiry were held, the evidence of the Re-Rollers would be of a most conflicting character. It might well appear that a moderate duty would not militate seriously against their interests.(c.) Constructional Steel.The percentage of steel used here was high, and, unless mutual agreement were reached, it appeared that it might be necessary to grant some form of rebate. The position was complicated by the fact that many of the firms engaged in constructional steel were themselves steel-makers. The Committee had not sufficient evidence to form a judgment as to this.(d.) Engineering.The evidence of the representative of the British Engineering Association had put a new light on the position of this section of the industry. The value of ; steel in engineering products amounted to from 12 to 14 per cent, of that of the total product, but the proportion of British steel employed amounted to about four-fifths or at any rate a very large proportion of the whole. It followed, therefore, that if by the grant of a duty the cost of British steel was reduced owing to increased production, the engineering industry would benefit as regards four-fifths of its raw material, even if -it had to pay more for the remaining one-fifth, Which at present consisted of foreign steel.It was important to bear in mind in considering this question that the grant of any assistance to the steel industry which would enable it to increase its production would be of great benefit to the coal position, and would also greatly ease that of the railways. For these reasons he was convinced that on practical grounds a primd facie case for enquiry had been made out, and that no facts as to the possible repercussion had been produced of sufficient weight to justify the Government on economic grounds in refusing to grant a Safeguarding enquiry. If, therefore, the industry&apos;s application were to be rejected, ft must be solely on political considera-tions, with which the Committee of Civil Research were not concerned.Mr. Churchill agreed that it was not possible then to discuss either the political aspect of the question or the conditions created by the Government pledges in regard to this matter. He welcomed, however, the statement of the President of the Board of Trade that the White Paper setting out the procedure to be followed in the Safe-guarding of Industries Act gave the Government full power, even if a primd facie case had been established, to refuse to grant an enquiry on the ground of the probable repercussions on other industries of a Safeguarding duty. He had firmly relied on this provision when the terms of the White Paper were under consideration. The express object of that provision had. in his view, been to enable the Government to avoid being forced to give lop-sided Protection or, by being led into a large number of consequential duties, to break their pledges on the question! of Free Trade.   He
believed that it was open to the Government to refuse the Steel Industry&apos;s application for a Safeguarding enquiry on the ground of repercussion, and in his opinion this was the course which ought to be adopted.Many of the witnesses who had appeared before the Committee were deeply and legitimately interested in the manufacture of steel, and there was no doubt that they would obtain great and immediate advantages from a duty. The Committee had also considered evidence from the Re-Rollers, from the shipowners (but not from the ship-builders, so far as the tariff aspect of the problem was concerned) and from the engineering industry. He felt sure, however, that if there was a public discussion there would be a great marshalling of the interests affected who would demand com-pensation or corresponding Protection. The experience of the Silk Duty had convinced him that Protection to the last iota would be demanded by interests affected if it were once decided to protect raw steel. This would raise an economic controversy of the first consequence.The cyclical periods of depression through which the steel industry had success-fully emerged in the past was striking. As far back as 1884 Lord Randolph Churchill had proclaimed the immediate ruin of the steel trade, and the same arguments had been put forward in the great controversy in 1903. As regards the present depression, he believed that, if more prudent councils had prevailed in the years 1919 and 1920, when large profits had been made, many of the present difficulties would have been avoided. Many of the chief steel companies had, however, made immense distributions of profits in the form of bonus shares. Clearly, if these profits had been carried to reserve, these firms would have been in a better position than they are to-day to meet world competition. A paper recently circulated to the Committee (C.R. (H) 43) showed that Professor Bone, F.R.S., held the view that it was probable that the world appetite for steel would increase within a comparatively short period, and some statisticians even held that this country might in time be faced with a labour famine. Tor these reasons he did not accept the view that without assistance by the Government the British steel industry would pass away. He was not convinced that any defence interests were involved to the extent of making Government action essential. The proper way to assist the industry was to lead them along the path of further concentration. This would involve amalgamation, either general or by regions, the setting up of an effective selling organisation, and the distribution of orders among the most profitable works. The Government should, he considered, refuse to grant a Safeguarding enquiry, but at the same time indicate their willingness to help the industry, perhaps through the Trade Facilities pro-cedure, towards securing further amalgamation. It was obvious that until the question of Safeguarding was definitely settled, the industry would take no steps towards that end. He wished to record his opinion that it was impossible to grant a Safeguarding enquiry owing to its indirect reactions cn other industries, but that, as regards amalgamation, if the trade desired to pursue this question further, they should be assured by the Government cf immediate and sympathetic consideration.When the Safeguarding question had been disposed of, he would be glad to confer with the President of the Board of Trade and the Secretary of Stats, for .War with a view to preparing a scheme cr schemes cf amalgamation to increase the efficiency of the trade,, and thereby help them to emerge from, their present difficulties, which were largely the aftermath of the War. If after their application were refused the industry were to sulk and refuse to consider the question cf further concentration, the Government cculd only await the working of economic forcss, but, even in that event, he believed that the steel industry would survive.Mr. Amery agreed tha/t it was not possible then to discuss the political aspects of this question; but he shared the view of the President of the Board cf Trade that nothing had appeared in the evidence in regard to the question of the possible repercussions of a duty that would justify the Government in refusing to grant a Safeguarding enquiry. Such evidence would, in his view, have to be very definite in character. The evidence before the Committee pointed quite as much one way as the other. Moreover, many considerations in favour of Safeguarding had not even been enquired into. No cne had, for instance, brought evidence to chew that in other countries where there was a protective tariff the steel-using industries were in. any way prejudiced. The whole industry complained, however, cf the burden of taxation. The imposition of a tariff would not only bring in to the Exchequer the amount of the duty, but by increasing production would also tend to &quot;increase the field and so lighten the incidence of taxation. On economic grounds, therefore, he believed that there would be no justification for refusing an enquiry.
The question of unemployment resolved itself really into the problem of how to secure that the goods produced by industry should be purchased. The easiest way to that end was to see that the people who were within your control should buy them. The problem was perfectly simple but for the influence of political controversy. To avoid this we were continually ignoring the obvious and trying to get some other way round. Every new alteration suggested broke down, both on cost and on other difficulties. These objections were equally valid against a direct subsidy, a subvention to railway rates or the use of Government credit to secure amalgamation. For the latter purpose he believed that it would be necessary to provide a heavy subvention if there was to be any hope of success. Even if this were attempted the Government&apos;s efforts might still be defeated by the stubborn individualism of British manufacturers.The appetite for steel in the world and this country was large enough, but under the Free Trade system it was allowed to be directed to foreign instead of British steel. The Government ought to face the elementary reality that if there is to be employment in this country steps must be taken to secure that the goods made in this country should be sold. In his view the enquiry had shown no alternative that could be applied in reasonable time or would produce appreciable results or could be carried out without great cost. He recommended therefore that the Committee should report to the Cabinet (1.) That they had failed to discover any alternative method of assisting the steel industry in its present difficulties. (2.) That they saw no economic grounds for refusing the application put forward by the industry for a safeguarding enquiry. (3.) That the political aspect of the question should be left to the Cabinet.Sir Maurice Hankey said that his views were summarised in the Paper (C.R.H. 40) which he had circulated jointly with Sir Warren Fisher and Sir Richard Hopkins to the Committee.He was principally interested in the question from the defence aspect, and on this he did not see any risk of steel production in this country becoming inadequate for national needs within a reasonable period of time. If it were decided to spend public money on the assistance of the industry he hoped that it would not be defended on the grounds of the requirements of national defence, as, if funds were available for defence, he thought that the Committee of Imperial Defence could find more profitable ways of expending them.Sir W. Fisher said that the joint Memorandum referred to above contained his views on the public, as apart from the political, aspects of this question. In his opinion no case had been established by the Industry for the granting of an enquiry. This conclusion carried with it an equal objection to any other form of assistance. As regards the grant of a subsidy, either direct or indirect, the difficulty would be where were they to stop and how were they to draw the line between cases where subsidies should or should not be paid. There was also the difficulty of finding the necessary money for a subsidy in the present grave financial position. He believed that other industries could put forward claims for financial assistance with as much or as little justification as the steel industry. On the question of Government guarantees under the Trade Facilities, procedure, he thought that there was a great danger to be apprehended if the Government were to become partners in industry, and that if this took place a noticeable step would have been taken in the direction of socialisation. As regards amalgamation, he felt that a strong case had been made out, showing that the industry was at present ill-organised. The evidence before the Committee had itself clearly demonstrated that in their proposals for protection the industry had not thought out the detailed implications of the course which they recommended.  He was therefore opposed to the grant of a safeguarding enquiry.Sir Richard Hopkins said that he had nothing to add to the views of Sir Warren Fisher, which were identical with his own.Sir II. Hirst said that as a business man he found it difficult sometimes to give all the reasons which might lead him to a particular conclusion. Following the evidence before the Committee, he had, however, reached the view that&apos; only two practical courses of action lay open. The first was Protection, and the other was to do nothing. He was entirely opposed to any form of subsidy, which would merely be helping manufacturers who ought to help themselves.   The question, to his mind,
was how to secure the production of sufficient steel in this country at a price low enough to enable British manufacturers to compete with their foreign rivals.If the Government were to decide to take no action, he imagined that the result would be that a number of firms would fail, and that these failures would be followed by amalgamations. This in turn might result in increased efficiency. This process, however, is slow, might well take some years, and, by that time, our steel industry might have drifted into hopeless impotence. Amalgamation undoubtedly would be a good thing, but it must be borne in mind that the position in this country was wholly dissimilar to that in America at the time when the United States Steel Corporation was formed. In that case, every firm obtained full value for its assets and received a bonus in the form of common stock. Such a procedure was only possible in a country like America, where there was Protection and also a reasonable prospect of continuous increase of population and demand. If such a scheme were attempted in this country any firm which took paper in a new combine would be faced with immediate loss. Rather than cut down capital, manufacturers preferred to carry u? as long as possible with their existing difficulties.He was, therefore, still of the opinion that a case had been made out for Protection. He shared the view of tbe President of the Board of Trade that the question of the possible repercussions on other industries of a duty on steel had not been sufficiently tested. If fuller evidence were available, he believed that it would be shown that these repercussions were less serious than were anticipated. Thus, in the engineering trade, it appeared that the steel content of engineering products did not amount to more than approximately 12 to 15 per cent. A 15 per cent, tariff on steel would therefore only affect the cost of engineering products to the extent of 1 per cent, or 1^ per cent. As regards shipbuilding, the evidence of the shipowners showed that total prohibition of steel imports would not increase the cost of a  130,000 steamer by more than the comparatively small sum of  1,500. His advice, therefore, was that further investigation should be made in regard to the question of repercussion before a definite decision was reached on the application of the industry for a Safeguarding enquiry.Sir L. W orthington-Evans said that as a tariff reformer he naturally sympathised with the application put forward by the industry. It was true, however, that steel, which was the raw material of many industries, was rather an odd commodity with which to initiate a scheme of Protection.As regards the steel-using industries, he was&apos; not altogether satisfied on the question of repercussion.(a.) Shipbuilding.The President of the Board of Trade proposed that if a tariff was granted there should be a complete drawback on all steel used in this industry. If this drawback was to be given, only to foreign steel, the duty would do very little to discontinue its use in preference to British steel.(b.) Re-rollers.The Re-rollers were at present making a profit of  1 a ton. Some of them were using British material in order to maintain abroad British reputation for quality. On the whole, he was doubtful whether this part of the industry was strong enough to pay much more for its raw material.(c.) Constructional Steel.It had been suggested that it might be necessary in this case also to grant a rebate. If this was so, it would have a serious effect on the tariff as constructional steel represented about 40 per cent, of the export trade.(d.) Engineering.Some parts of the engineering trade were highly competitive, and he was convinced from private conversations that there was a genuine belief, of which account must be taken by the Government, that a duty on steel would constitute a serious handicap for this trade.On the whole, therefore, he believed that the repercussions of a duty might be more serious than the President of the Board of Trade apprehended. This question might, however, be further explored by a Safeguarding Committee. It was, indeed, largely for this purpose that these Safeguarding Committees had been
set up. Under them there existed machinery for examining questions of this kind. If the Government were to decide to refuse the industry&apos;s application for a Safeguarding enquiry, the onus, he felt, would lie upon them to say that they were satisfied that no primd facie case of any kind had been established for Safeguarding. For these reasons, apart from political considerations, he saw no reason why the request for a Safeguarding enquiry should not be granted.As regards the other proposals for assisting the industry which had been submitted to the Committee, the only one which in his view was likely to be fruitful of results was amalgamation. If this were pursued, the Government could supply cheap money to firms who were willing to amalgamate. This was, in effect, similar in principle to the offer already made with the sanction of the Government by the Trade Facilities Committee to entertain applications for guarantees to enable firms to set up new plants instead of old. If amalgamation was to be successful, the banks would clearly have to co-operate to a greater extent than at present they appeared to be willing to do. It would also be necessary for some important member of the industry to lead the movement. Otherwise the industry would continue to drift until firms were compelled by economic forces to come to terms with their stronger rivals.Sir A. Steel-Maitland said that his views largely agreed with those of the Secretary of State for War. This case really stood by itself, and he was not satisfied with the evidence which the Committee had received regarding the effect of a duty on the steel-using trade and on the export trade. If the application were sent to the Safeguarding Committee, he felt confident that a large number of entirely new objections would come to light. In any case, he did not believe that the difficulties of the export trade could be met by drawback. If the Government decided to take no action, he saw no reason to anticipate a collapse of the steel industry. He was satisfied that there should be further concentration in the industry, and he feared that a duty if imposed would tend to delay this process. This had not been the case elsewhere, but he believed it would have that effect in this country. Once the Banks realised that the Government did not intend to grant protection, they would, he believed, use their influence in favour of the industry getting together with a view to further amalgamation.No doubt if a Safeguarding enquiry were granted, the objections entertained towards the duty by steel users would clearly emerge. Previous enquiries of this kind, e.g., thaton wrapping paper, whichithad been expected would prove uncontroversial, had shown that many unsuspected objections were brought to light in this way. The important question of - further concentration in the industry would not, however, come out in a Safeguarding enquiry, and on the whole he was therefore opposed to the grant by the Government of the application put forward by the industry.Lord BdLfour said that he had the strongest conviction that the Government would be ill-advised to send this application before a Safeguarding Committee unless they were satisfied that they could carry out any recommendations such a Committee might make. For his part, he believed that the Government would find it almost impossible to pass the legislation that would be necessary to impose a duty. The fiscal question always raised controversies of extraordinary acuteness, and was the source of every kind of prejudice. It was, moreover, apt to raise dormant differences of a party character which could not fail to be exceedingly embarrassing to any Government even under the most favourable circumstances. And the circumstances were not favourable. A duty on steel was specially difficult to defend against the familiar Free Trade arguments owing to the fact that steel is a raw material required by an immense number of different manufactures, while the steel industry itself is largely an export trade.Further amalgamation was no doubt in many cases most desirable in . this industry, but, in his view, the Government could not properly initiate, or success-fully carry through, the necessary negotiations. If, however, the leaders of the steel industry were to prepare a definite plan of amalgamation and were then to approach the Government for financial assistance, the Government might give their proposals sympathetic consideration.He had been deeply impressed with a statement by Professor Bone, F.R.S., that the world need for steel, measured in decennial periods, had in the past, shown an immense and progressive increase. This increase had been exaggerated by the War, and the British steel industry was now suffering partly because during that period it had developed in advance of normal peace-time demands and partly because the increase of peace-time demands had lagged behind the normal owing to bad trade. This, however, could hardly last, and then the excess of steel plants in this country
would come to a natural end. Was it not possible for the Government to assist the industry by anticipating this recovery by immediately carrying out works urgently required in the Empire? Many of the Colonies and dependencies were greatly in need of capital expenditure in the form of railway development, which in effect meant a large expenditure on steel. This, in his view, would be a sound policy., not opr. 1 to fiscal objection, and would enable the Government to carry out their obligations to these dependencies. Moreover, such expenditure would not ultimately be a financial burden, but would increase the resources of the dependencies and thus strengthen the Empire, and develop Empire Trade.Another plan, perhaps rather fantastic, that had been put to the Committee sesmed to him to justify further consideration. He had been impressed with the enormous burden of obsolete tonnage that was lowering freights, reducing ship-building, and menacing our position as the great carrying country of the world. Much advantage usually followed the scrapping of obsolete machinery. Could not this process, which was admittedly healthy on land, be extended to obsolete machinery afloat ?The Prime Minister said that on merits, and without reference to political considerations, he was satisfied that the application of the industry ought to go to a Safeguarding enquiry. The two proposals suggested by Lord Balfour were worthy of serious attention, and if the Government were to decide that it could not help the steel industry, many of whose difficulties were the result of past action by previous Governments, one or both of these proposals ought to be carefully considered.After further discussion, the Committee agreed (1.) That the Prime Minister should convey to the Cabinet the views formed by the members of the Committee as the result of their enquiry.(2.) That the Committee should meet at a later date to consider the question of railway development in the Dominions, Colonies and India, and that in the meanwhile the Secretary should arrange for the circulation to the Committee of the report on Indian railways by the late Sir William Acworth.(3.) That the President of the Board of Trade should write to Mr. Clarence D. Smith, the Chairman of the Consett Iron Company, asking him to submit as soon as possible his scheme for dealing with obsolete tonnage for consideratiomby the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, November 19, 1925.o
