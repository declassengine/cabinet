On the basis of the 1925 estimates the present annual expenditure at Pembroke and Rosyth Dockyards is :  ;  &quot;Pembroke        .... ....   ..... .... 362,725Rosyth .... .... .... .... ....      777,175Total        .... .... .... ....    1,139,900If the yards are reduced to care and maintenance this expenditure will become : &apos;   &apos;      .*     .Pembroke        .... .... .... .... ....        17,400Rosyth .... .... ..... ....      103,450Total        ....          .... .... .... 120,850The saving will therefore be: .........Pembroke        ....         .... .:      .... .... .... 345,325Rosyth            ....         ....          ..... .... .... 673;725Total        .... .... .... ....    1,019,0502. Not alL this saving is attributable solely to the closing of these yards. If the work which is now being done at those yards were transferred to the southern yards, the saving, as-stated above, would be reduced by the amounts-Which would have;had to be spent at.other yards, viz.: v:.u      ;. .. ;       &apos; , ^u&apos;. ttjs&amp;x s:i% W, idi&quot;Kill)-       ;:j     . -a  -          &apos;     : Y   !On account of Pembroke work    .... .... ....      254,000\&quot; .

It is known that large reductions of Dockyard work will in fact be made, and the Admiralty anticipate that further reductions of Dockyard numbers will enable the full saving of  1,019,050 to be realised within two years.3. Owing to the measures necessary in order to effect the reduction, the net saving (comparable to the figures in paragraph 2 above) is estimated to be in 1925     .... .... .... ....        ..... ....      18,900:   .1926     .... .... .... ....     .    .... 35,500These figures take into account, inter alia, the grant of lodging allowances to established workmen transferred to Southern Yards, estimated at  80,000. No special housing schemes at the Southern Ports are being proposed by the Admiralty.4. The figures of personnel at the two yards are as follows: 	Total	Total after	Numbers to be	Complement	Reduction to	Discharged	I now Borne.	C. and M. Basis.	or Disposed of.Rosyth.

In any casV unemployment resulting from the closing of these two Dockyards would be merged in the general unemployment of the country, and untraceable after a single year..,,. Therefore .AJlI?ej^l...caio!a.la^Qj)^..tij?^skocept the Ministry of Labour&apos;s figures, not as an annual chai-ge, but as a once-for-ail payment.
5. The Ministry of Labour estimate that (on certain assumptions&apos; as- to the families of workmen at Rosyth and Pembroke) the maximum cost of paying unemployment benefit to men discharged from the yards would; be about  1,850 a week at Rosyth and about  900 at Pembroke, and taking into account further unemployment owing to the reaction on workers outside the yards themselves, the total cost in unemployment benefit might probably be put at something under  3,000 asjweek at the commencement, falling to  2,000.These estimates are, however, based on the total discharges at the two yards and are thei&apos;efore comparable, not with the figure of  327,700 in paragraph 2, but with the figure of  1,019,050 in paragraph 1.Unemployment benefit is paid from the Unemployment Fund and not from the Exchequer, which pays its contribution on the numbers employed.6. Claim by Dunfermline Town Council. The Burgh of Dunfermline extended its boundaries in 1911 to include the dockyard area, thus becoming liable for the provision of municipal services, e.g., water supply, sewerage, &amp;c, for the dockyard and surrounding houses, and, on the other hand, receiving a contribution in lieu of rates on the Government establishment. In 1923, following reductions of establishment at Rosyth, they complained that they had lost money and asked for compensation, broadly on the ground that they had been: Induced to incur a large capital expenditure on expectations held out by the. Admiralty but not realised. The Treasury, on being consulted by the Admiralty, rejected the application on principle.A formal application was received from the Town Council in June 1924 making a claim for  72,262 plus a continuing contribution in respect of sewer assessment, particulars being Queensferry Road formation      .... .... ....   21,812Water supply .... .... .... .... ....   28,290    -Main outfall sewer       .... .... .... ....   22,16072,262Plus sewer claim to May 1924 =  5,727,and the claim was again rejected. It is understood that the Burgh have now beem legally advised that they have a claim at law.It is not known what further sum the Burgh might claim in consequence of the further reduction of Rosyth. It is understood that the total expenditure in respect of which they might claim would not exceed  250,000.Similar claims might be made by the Fife Education Authorities in respect of schools erected by them (stated to have cost  120,000) and by the Dunfermline^ Parish Council in respect of a cemetery (which cost  14,000). ... i . .: .Claims, for compensation from the Local Authorities will no doubt be resisted. 7. Housing for dockyard employees has been erected by the Scottish National Housing Company, which has built 1,700 houses. Owing to the rise during the war of building costs, the Treasury guaranteed 5 per cent, interest on their capital, and this occasions an annual loss of  25,000. If, as estimated by the Housing Company, as many as 1,000 houses become vacant by reason of the reduction of Rosyth, a further  27,000 per annum loss is anticipated. TNo claim has been received from Pembroke, and any claim could only be made for an ex gratia grant. It is stated that the local building society is owed about  35,000 by the workmen. T8.
