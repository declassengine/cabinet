SAFEGUARDING OP INDUSTRIES.REPORT OP THE CUTLERY COMMITTEE...To the Right Honourable Sir Philip Cunliffa-Lister, *.B.E. President of the Board of Trade.M. 0M.PSir,1.We were appointed by you on the 29th Septeinber, 1925,to enquire Into and report upon the application made by the Sheffield Cutlery Manufacturers1 Association, in accordancewith the white Paper   relating to Procedure  &quot;?nd Enquiries in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries for the imposition of a duty upon Imported Cutlery.In camera on three occasions.     we have examined twenty witnesses and in addition, we have been furnished by. the Board Of Trade with valuable memoranda on subjects upon which we have desired information.     The Applicants were represented by Counsel, Mr. W.B. Faraday, and the Opposition by Mr. W.M.R. Pringle and Mr. Tudor Davies appearing on behalf of the Cutlery Import Group Committee of the London Chamber of Commerce.3. The Applicants were the Sheffield Cutlery Manufacturers&apos;Association, the recognised organisation of employers in the industry, comprising 66 firms, which claimed to represent 80 per cent, of the industry.     It was stated that other firms not in the Association were in full agreement with the application, while representatives from trade unions gave evidence in;support.     The claim as to the proportion of the trade represented was based on productive wages and, after examining the figures put forward, we are satisfied that the statement is correct.2.We have held twelve meetings and have taken evidence*Cmd. 2327. -1-
4. The first matter to which we addressed ourselves,since It was one that affected the consideration of all thepoints of the White Paper, yyss the exact definition of the classes of articles covered by the application.    In their case as originally put forward, the Applicants used the following headings of Group (E) of Class III of the Trade Returnspublished by the Board of Trade :-Knives, other than machine knives (including knife blades and blanks).Scissors and shears (including blanks).Safety razors (including blades and blanks)Other       &quot; &quot; &quot;        &quot;       &quot;Other cutlers&apos; wares. These headings were drawn up-purely for statistical purposes, and, in the event of the imposition of a duty, many articles of cutlery which are at present recorded under different headings of the Trade Returns might quite well be deemed to come within the headings used by the Applicants, particularly the last one of &quot;Other cutlers1 wares&quot;.    The Opponents stressed this point, as it naturally affected   the extent of their interest in the inquiry and we therefore asked the Applicants to submit a detailed list of the articles which they wished to have covered by their application.    This list, which is reproduced as Appendix I, served the purpose of removing doubt as to the classes or descriptions of goods to which our inquiry would have to be directed and, in making our recommendation, we have adopted a definition of those of goods in the list in respect of which we consider a case has been made out.
The evidence submitted by the Applicants,  so far as costs and prices were concerned, related to certain specific articles which they claimed to be representative of the classes of articles in the list,  together with certain other specific articles to which the Opponents had drawn attention.In making our report, we take the questions put to us in paragraphs  (1) and (8) of Section II of the ?^hite Paper relating to Procedure and Enquiries in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries  (hereinafter referred to as. the &quot;White Paper&quot;) and deal with eaoh in turn,(1)    Whether the applicant industry is, by reason of the volume of employment engaged in the production of the goods to which the application relates,  or by reason of the nature of the goods produced,  an industry of substantial Importance,The trade of cutlery making is a very old and celebrated one In the town of Sheffield.   We were reminded that Sir Walter Scott in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; mentioned that in the reign of King John, Sheffield was celebrated for making knives and whittles,  and Mr, Faraday informed us that researches have established the fact that knives were made at Sheffield when Julius Caesar landed in Kent and that ever since that time the trade has been carried on in the town with unexampled success as regards the quality of the product.The numbers employed in the whole industry were given by the Applicants for the years 1915 and the post-war years 1920-1924,     In-1913 it was 11,686 and in 1924, 7,697, and these figures again were based on returns from members of the Association    The Census of Production for 1907 gives the total numbers employed by firms with over 5 workpeople as 11,816 and, since it may be assumed   from the general pre-war trend of the trade that the numbers engaged did not vary very
much between 1907 and 1913,  the Census of Production figures tend to confirm those given by the Applicants. 9. It may be mentioned that the Opponents did not contestthe claim of the Applicants for an affirmative answer to this question, and we are satisfied that the volume of employment engaged, entitles the industry to be considered one of substantial importance.(2). Whether foreign goods of the class or description to which the application relates are being imported into and retained for consumption In the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.10.. The only statistics available related to the trade recordedunder the headings referred to in paragraph 4 above and we think there is no doubt that these statistics substantially representthe trade in the classes of goods included in the Applicants1list.   Some difficulty was experienced owing to the fact that a revision took place in 1920 in the units in which cutlery goods were described in the Trade Returns with the result that in1913 quantities were recorded in owts. while in 1920 and subsequent years they were recorded In dozens.     Also the distinction made in 1920 and subsequent years between thedifferent classes of cutlery did not appear in the 1913. returns.Other difficulties arose out of the   varying character ofthe Imports and the inclusion of parts of articles at various stages of completion,  the difficulty being particularlyapparent in the case of safety razors and blades .
The abnormality of the importation may be considered either absolutely or by reference to production in this country.      InAppendix II we reproduce detailed figures of imports, from1920 up to and including the first nine months of this year0As already stated, details are not available for 1913, butthe totals for that year are given in the table.     The general.deduction to be drawn from these figures is that there isthroughout a heavy increase in importation now over 1913*With the exception of safety razors and &quot;Other cutlers1 wares&quot;,by far the greatest proportion of the imports in each of the classes have come from Germany and, even in safety razors,the proportion of the German trade has increased till the gross imports from Germany are now about one half byquantity and one eleventh by value of the total gross imports*In all the classes of cutlery there was a marked swelling ofthe imports from Germany during the years of depreciatedcurrency and consequent export bounty.     1922 is the peakyear, the tendency persists to a lesser extent in 1923 whenefforts were made to stabilise the mark,  and it does notdisappear till the final stabilisation on the introduction ofthe Reichmark in 1924,     The stabilisation of the mark hasbeen too recent to permit of the testing of the course ofimports under these new conditions, though the figures forthe first nine months of 1925 show that the rate of Impor-tatlon during 1924 is not only maintained but exceeded and,in view of the absence of any succession of normal years since the war, comparison must still, to a large extent, bemade with the pre-war period.Striking confirmation of the deductions made from theBritish import figures is obtained by a study of the Germanfigures of exports to this and other countries given in
C 9 1 e$ &amp;  appendix III-    -dalle the total weight both of coarse and fine cutlery exported has diminished as compared with pre-war, the quantitios of coarse cutlery exported to the United Kingdom have been trebled in 1924 and are likely to be quadrupled In 1925, while those of fine cutlery also show substantial increases.13.        The best test of the abnormality of imports from the point of view of its effect on the industry here is, however, the ratio of the impels to production In this country and, for the reasons given in the last preceding paragraph, the standard with which this ratio must be compared must still, we think, be the pre-war period,    *.e were provided by the Applicants with figures of production in different years based on the known exports in those years and obtained by ascer-taining the ratio of home to export trade done by eight representative firms, including large and small concerns, and striking a general ratio of home to export trade for the whole industry.    This is not an ideal method of obtaining the figures of production of an industry, but in the absence of an official Census of Production since 1907 we were forced to accept the estimates, and they are given in columns 4 and 5 of Table I referred to in the next succeeding paragraph. For purposes of comparison with 1913 it may be mentioned that the value of cutlery produced in Sheffield in 1907, according to the Census of Production, was a little over  1,500,000,14. Taking the applicants  figures of production and theBoard of Trade returns of retained imports, the ratio   of imports to production both on quantity and on value in various years is shown in Table I as follows:-

The Applicants have endeavoured to produce a ratio by quantities which would eliminate some of the more misleading features, but In eaoh case the calculations were based on assumptions that seriously impaired their accuracy and we prefer to take the more conserva-tive comparison by values given in the last column of the table.
r; 9 9tf w uj15. Y/e are of opinion that the figures in Appendices II and and in Table I establish the Applicants&apos;  case under paragraph (2) of the White Paper.(3) Whether the foreign goods so imported are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.16. In support of their case under this heading, the applicants originally submitted samples of three razors, three pairs of scissors, and five pocket knives, giving the c.i.f. price of the German sample and the cost of manufacture of the similar article in this country in each case.   The wholesale price of the German article varied from 7 per cent, to 75 per cent, below the cost of manufacture here.    The original invoices for the German articles were produced and we were informed that the prices had actually fallen since the case had been drawn up.    The figures for the cost of manufacture of the Sheffield articles were averages based on the certified costings of six different firms and the details of these - as of all the other confidential evidence - were supplied to Counsel for the Opponents for purposes of examination.    Comment was made on the disparity between the wages and materials costs of the different firms for the same article, but it was explained that this was due simply to the fact that materials in varying stages of manufacture were used and so resulted in some firms having a higher materials cost than others with a correspondingly lower wages cost, and we accept this explanation.17. An important contention of the Opponents which applied to other headings of the White Paper, but more particularly to this, was that the bulk of the goods imported from Germany belong to a class altogether inferior to that
V **! Smanufactured in this country.    It was alleged that these German goods did not compete with the English ones, but supplied a market which was not touched by the home-produced articles and which was in some respects a post war development. This contention was supported by several witnesses and attention was drawn to the fact that the average values of each class of imported cutlery were lower than the values of the German samples produced.    In connection with the calculation of average values of imports- there must be taken into account the inclusion in the Trade Returns of partly manufactured articles and also an extreme range of fully manufactured articles.   This is particularly so in the case of knives which may vary from an expensive pocket knife down to the simplest domestic vegetable knife and in the absence of information as to the proportions of the different articles covered by the general headings, no conclusive comparison can be made between these average values and the values of particular samples produced.   As, however, a certain presumption was set up that the general line of article imported was cheaper than that which the Applicants originally exhibited to the Committee, we pressed them on the point and further evidence was given to show that some of the cheapest grades of articles imported from Germany were actually being made in Sheffield, and while the difference in price was admitted,, it was claimed that this difference was, in a substantial measure, due to the extreme depression in the trade.    Under present conditions, the machinery - much of which is modern and highly efficient -cannot be economically employed because no continuous output Is assured.
f P&apos; 0 &amp; e)18. On the quostion of- whether the German and Sheffield artioleaactually produced were &quot;similar&quot; or &quot;of the same class, or description&quot;, we are satisfiod that, whatever difference there may be in the qualities of the steel or in general durability, the articles have the same appearance and finish and from the point of view of the ordinary purchaser, they are equivalent and one is substituted for the other.19. In the course of the Inquiry a number of other articles,including razor blades and shoe-knives, were exhibited by the Applicants together with the German selling prices and the Sheffield cost of manufacture,  to supplement the evidence relating to the prices and costs referred to in paragraph 16 above.   We are satisfied as to the representative nature of those samples.20.        We are of opinion that the classes of goods referred to in our recommendation below, imported from Germany, are being sold or Offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.(4) Whether, by reason of the severity and extent ofsuch competition, employment in the manufacture or production of suoh goods In the United Kingdom is being, or is likely to be, seriously affected.21. We have boen unable to obtain the actual figures ofunemployment in the cutlery industry, as the statistics ofinsured people unemployed relating to this industry areincluded in the Ministry of Labour Gazette in the largerclass of &quot;Hand Tool, Cutlery, Saw and File Making&quot; and themethod of record in use does not make it possible to distinguish the smaller groups in this class,   A further difficulty is that there are a large number of uninsured persons engaged in the industry which would not be Included in theMinistry of Labour figures.    The figures given by the Applicants
related to the numbers actually employed and were based on the numbers employed by firms in the Association, these numbers being increased by 25$ to represent the whole trado. The figures Including the average hours worked per week, were as follows:-APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF WORKPEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THE SutLEkY^industry AND HOURS WORKED. &apos;1           1 Year.       \	Males.	Females.	Total employed.

We received valuable evidence on the subject ofemployment from the witnesses from Trade Unions.   Before tho war 90 per cent, of those employed in the industry woro members of the Unions, now, as a result of the depression in the Industry, the percentage has dropped to 65 per cont.    In 1913 there woro   3,350 employed in the table knife section, about the same in the pooket knife section, 800 in the razor section and 500 in the scissors section.    This Total of 8,000 represented those actually working in the shops, whereas the total of 11,686 given in paragraph 21, covered all omployees. The   unemployed at present on the books of the Unions in the various sections are - tablo knives 400, pocket knives 1,500, razors 700 and soiosors 200, totalling 2,000 and the percentage unemployed in tho four Cutlery Unions i3 40 per cent, as   oompared with 5 per cent, before the war.
r 9 nThe most remarkable of these figures are those for unemployed in the razor section -700 out of 800- and this of course is due to the reduction in the use of the ordinary razor and the competition of the comparable imported article in the restricted market. Both the Trade Union witnesses and the employers emphazised the scarcity of apprentices and the danger that this fact alone held for the future of the Industry, 23, That the industry is suffering from serious unemployment is beyond dispute and, though it is impossible to express imports in terms of unemployment, we are satisfied that the acuteness of the present unemployment is directly due to the competition which we have found to exist,(5)   &quot;hether such exoeptlonal competition comes largely from countries where the conditions are -go different from those in this country as to render the competition unfair ,Competition for the purpose of such enquiry is not to be deemed to be unfair unless it arises from one or more of the following causes(a) Depreciation of currency operating so as tocreate an export bounty.(b) Subsidies, bounties, or other artificialadvantages.(c) Inferior conditions of employment of labour,whether as respects remuneration or hours of employment, or otherwise obtaining amongst the persons employed in the production of the imported goods in question as compared with those obtaining amongst persons employed in the production of similar goods in the United Kingdom,In msking their report upon the alleged unfairness of the competition, the Committee may call -attention to any special circumstances by reason of which, in their opinion, the industry in the United Kingdom is placed at a serious relative disadvantage,24,       In our inquiry under this heading we have, as might be expected, experienced difficulty in obtaining reliable information as to the condition obtaining in Germany,     No claim was ma.de under sub-heading (a) relating to depreciation of currency for the obvious reason that the value of the mark is now stabilised.
Under (b) our attention was drawn to seyeral minor advantages which Germany is said to possess over this country.    These included a preferential railway rate for export goods, said to amount to 1 per cent, of the value of the goods, a remission of turnover tax of 2\ per cent,  on goods exported, and a difference in social insurance payable by the employer between the two countries of lOd. per man per week - a difference shortly to be increased by the payments under the new Pensions Act.     We have   been unable to estimate the extent of the effect of these artificial advantages the existence of which however was not disputed. 25. The main evidence advanced by the Applicants was under sub-heading (c) in respect of wages and hours of work, and, in support of the contention that wages in Germany are lower than In Sheffield, they produced an agreement dated 28th March, 1925, between the Metal Workers1 Union of Cologne and their employers. This agreement fixed various scales of remuneration for time and piece work and the applicants took the highest figure shown, viz. 72 Pfennigs per hour, equivalent to 8jd. in English money, as the wage, including piece work arrangements, of a skilled German workman.   We endeavoured to ascertain whether the wages in the Cutlery industry in Solingen were in fact the same as those for the metal Industry generally in the Cologne area, but although it was suggested by the Opponents that the metal workers wages were not applicable, they were unable to help us as to the wages In Solingen.   We ascertained from the Ministry of Labour, that, so far as they were aware, no wages data regarding the German Cutlery industry proper were published. We had to assume, therefore, that the metal workers rates applied to cutlery workers, and from information given in &quot;Wlrtschaft und Statiatik&quot;  (the organ of the German Federal Statistical Office) we found that wages in the metal industry had been raised on 17th July last from 69 to 73 Pfennigs an
cj 2 9   Ihour for skilled workmen and that, on the new rate, the./weighted average earnings, inc luding .. family allowances,were 87.6 Pfennigs an hour or 47.30 Reichmarks per week of54 hours.      This information confirms the statement we received from another source that wages In the Cologne area had been increased since the March agreement by about A%and that the March tariff, plus this percentage, was stillin force.      The wages quoted in &quot;Wirtschaft und Statistik&quot;appear to be average wages, so that, on the assumptionthat the highest rate in March of 72 Pfennigs was increasedby the same amount as the average rate of 69 Pfennigs, thepresent earnings of the man selected by the Applicants canbe ascertained by multiplying the hourly and weekly earnings of 87.6 Pfennigs and 47.30 Reichmarks by giving thew Johighest earnings in the metal workers union as 91.1 Pfennigs and 49.19 Reichmarks per hour and w eek respectively. The equivalents in English money of these wages  (with the mark at par) would be lOfd. per hour and 48/2d.  per week of 54 hours.With regard to hours of work in Germany,  the Applicants put forward the figure of 56 hours per week; but the hours given In &quot;lirtschaft und Statistik&quot; for the Cologne area, in respect of which the wages have been taken, are 54 per week.    The  week of 56 hours appears, again according to &quot;Wirtschaft und Statistik&quot;, to be worked in certain other towns near Cologne (not including Solingen) but in this case the wage is slightly higher.      The working week in these towns was 57-1 in January and February of this ye ar.
27. Reference may be made to the position in Germanyregarding the legal 48 hour week, as it was contended by the Opponents that this was still enforced.     We find it recorded in the Ministry of Labour Gazette for October 1925 that the legal restriction of the working hours of manual and non-manual workers to 8 a day or 48 a week was established in Germany by Orders dated 23rd November, 1918, 17th December 1918 and 18th March, 1919.     These Orders lapsed in .  November 1923 and were renewed, with extensive amendments, by an Order dated 21st December, 1923, which came into force on 1st January, 1924, and which is still in force.    This last Order confirmed the general principle of the 8 hour day or 48 hour week but it introduced a number of provisions permitting of extensions of hours, under certain conditions, up to 10 a day.28. The wage rates current in Sheffield give hourlyearnings for skilled workers varying from l/l^d. to l/6d. according to the section of the trade.     These are based on fixed price lists, conies of which were provided for our inspection.     The week generally in operation is one of 47 hours.29. No account has been taken in the evidence as to wages and hours of the home-workers in Sheffield or in Solingen.     The conditions, in this respect of such workers are no doubt inferior to those employed in factories, but the proportion which they form of the whole industry is not less in Solingen than in Sheffield - in Solingen we are informed it is 50 per cent, * and we have assumed that they balance one another in their effect on the competitive power of the industry in each country.30* On the evidence before us as to the lower hourly wagesand the longer working week in Germany as compared with this country, we are of opinion that the conditions in Germany are so different as to render the competition unfair.

ti1     132.Thex^ are two further matters to which we consider reference should he made under the last sentence of paragraph (5) of the White Paper.The first of these is the question of the marking of imported goods.     The Applicants laid considerable stress on the practice of foreign exporters of sending roods to this country j-ot uo to convey the impression that they are made in England, with the result that the ultimate purchaser, and often even the shopkeeper, does not know whether he is buying Sheffield or foreign goods.     Evidence was given to show that cutlery cernes in stamped in English lettering &quot;cast Steel&quot; &quot;made from Sheffield Steel&quot; &quot;Warranted Quality&quot; etc. and that labels and catalogues are made up and printed in exactly the same manner as those for Sheffield goods.     The extent to which the practice of attaching misleading marks is carried on is shewn by the table of detentions given on page 78 of the Sixteenth Report of the Commissioners of H.M. Customs and Excise for the year ended 31st March, 1925* which we reproduce below.Merchandise Marks Acts: Detentions.	Consignments Detained.			Disposal.				r &apos;d	At the Ports	in		Delivered.

Many of the descriptions, it appears, do not contravene the existing. Merchandise Marks law and we wish to suggest for your earnest consideration the desirability ofS!2i^A^BE.^lP^JzSE. to compel the indelible marking jf all articles of imported cutlery with.....a clear indication that they are ,qf* Grid. 2485, ,V......pi i!
ei 413 ;Gforeign origin,   in making this -recommendation we have had regard to the fact that suoh requirements are already in force in other countries - we observe that the American Tariff Act contains very precise instructions on the subject - and we consider that their absence in this  country places the Sheffield industry at a serious disadvantage. *        The second of the special circumstances to which we wish to draw attention is the advantage which German manufacturers generally have obtained by re-equipping their factories during the period of the depreciated mark with the newest and most competitive machinery on an extremely low capital basis.   Now that the value of the mark has been restored, such manufacturers are able to enter into world competition with capital liabilities in respect of buildings and plant that are practically negligible.(6) Whether the applicant industry is being carried on in the United Kingdom with reasonable efficiency and economy.The Committee were impressed with the evidence given by the head of one of the largest manufacturing companies In Sheffield who was Chairman of a Cutlery Mission which investigated German Cutlery Factories at the Invitation of the Overseas Trade Depart-ment of the Board of Trade In the year 1919.   He informed us that the Mission visited a very large number of Cutlery Factories in Solingen and other German towns and he submitted a oopy of the report made by the Mission which was dated July, 1919.   The following are extracts from the report-&quot;Machinery is used to a greater extent than in Sheffield, and the processes of manufacture very much sub.-divided.   All laborious work is eliminated where possible,, machines being used for many operations done by hand In Sheffield.    One very striking feature is the preparation of parts in the most perfect and finished manner to an Infinite degree.Female and boy labour is used to a large extent, and skilled labour only where real skill is required this tending to a very large increase of output.   There will no doubt be a very large demand for Cutlery in the future, but we fear Germany is very much better organised at present to supply that demand
than Sheffield is. This situation, though, is one that can and should be rectified.A rather disturbing feature we noticed in the various factories was the extremely large stocks of both finished and unfinished goods that were seen about,especially of Scissors, many bearing no marks, others marked &quot;Sheffield Steel&quot; and &quot;Warranted Forged Steel&quot;.Many of the machines we saw In use are similar to those at present operating In Sheffield, but it became clear to all of us that a greater application of Machinery to the Sheffield Cutlery trade would help considerably   in meeting German com-petition in respect both of prices and output&quot;. 35, The Chairman of the Mission further stated that he had madepurchases of machinery in Germany and brought them to England with a view to  installing them in some of the Sheffield factories,which had 3inoe been done, but with very little advantage to the tr de,as he alleged that the use of expensive machinery In Sheffield factories has proved of no avail without an assured Home Market, If the out-put of the factory 13 small, It is found by experience to be more economical to manufacture by manual processes. No advantage Is to be gained from the use of machinery unless the machinery is kept constantly employed,  and this is not possible when orders are few and far between.36. From the evidence that was submitted to us it is clear thatSheffield Cutlery Manufacturers are desirous of bringing their factories up-to-date In every possible respect, but they must be in a position to attract capital in order to do so. They have not got the cash to-day for the purpose, and there is no prospect of their obtaining it unless there is a very marked Improvement of trade,37, The Committee were impressed with the work carried on by theBritish Cutlery Research Association and with the report of the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific and Industrial Researci for the year 1924/25,in which reference Is made to the work of that Association. The following is an extract from the report:-&quot;Results of considerable significance to the industry
have already .   oesn obtained by the Association but their further development requires much greater financial resources than have hitherto been available. In the present unfortunate state of the industry it is an extremely difficult matter to secure an increased subscription income, oven with the enlarged membership. The possibilities of securing the fruition of the work of the Association are at present under consideration&quot;.A review of the work of the Research Association has recently been carried out by the Department of&quot; Scientific and Industrial Research and, though we understand that the torms of the report of the Inspection Committee have not been communicated to the Association, it appears that the Department was satisfied as to the prospect of the work proving of practical value, since it has made a very gonorous offer of further financial assistance.38. Again, efforts are made to keep the employers and workersInterested in their industry, and evidence was given as to the valuable work dono by the Cutlery Trades&apos; Technical Society in arranging for the reading of papers and for discussions upon subjects affecting its welfare.39. The following statement has been submitted by the applicantrolating to the expenditure between 1913 and 1924 on new buildings, plant and machinery by twenty-two firms who are members of the Sheffield Cutlery Manufacturers1 Association, andthe sub-joined figures will bo found of interest.Summary of Returns of 22 Firms.Total Expenditure on New Buildings.......        42 ,,526Total Expend!turo on Now Plant as  71,759follows:-War Expenditure War Plant not usablo for commercial Work.........        6,290War Plant usable for Commercial Work.........        4,142 ..  10,432Plant for Commercial Work............  61.327Expenditure oh NW&quot;Plant..............  71,759
*&quot;6  % H^     ei4o . We are gatiaf ted, after a careful review of all theevidence on this point, that the applicant industry is being carried on with reasonable efficiency and economy.(7) Whether the imposition of a duty on goods of the class or description in question would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment in any other industry, boing an industry using goods of that class or description in production.41. This paragraph of the White Paper can only apply tothe industry under consideration to a very limited extent and that is in reference to certain knives used as tools of a trade.    The particular instanoe of shoe^knives was discussed at some length before us and, on the evidence of a. practical shoe-maker, it was found that he used four knives a year costing him 9d. each,    A duty of say 3sV?rd* Per pent, on those knives would, on the assumption that the consumer pays tho whole duty, cost him l/- per annum.   We are convinced that possible charged of this character&quot; could not, in any circumstances be said to exert a seriously adverse effect on omployment in any industry and we answer this question in the negative.42. Before passing to our general recommendation under paragraph (8) of the White Paper, we wish to refer to the special plea put in by the opponents regarding shoe knives. We were asked to exclude those from the classes of cutlery under consideration, on tho ground that Swedish knives aro consistently preferred   by shoemakers to the Sheffield knives because of their superior quality and it was stated that they are actually doaror than the home-produced article. Both these allegations were, as a matter of fact, disputed by the Applicants arid we camo to the conclusion, from the contradictory nature of tho evidence from both sides, that the question pf superiority was largely a matter of personal preference. The whole question was,however, irrelevant, in our opinion
*t ts Qunless it could be proved that the main importation came from Sweden and not from germany    This the Opponents failed to do, and, in the absence of any separate statistics regarding the importation of shce knives, we are bound to assume that the trade in them follows that in the general class of knives to which they belong,     We should add that we were satisfied from the evidence given by the Applloants that German shoe knives are being sold in this country at prices below those at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured here and that the other conditions of the White Paper applied equally to these knives as to the others Included in the general classes referred to in our re commendation *(8) Whether, having regard to the above conditions,  the applicant industry ha3,  in the opinion of the Committee, established a claim to a dutyj    and,  if so, what rate or rates of duty,  in the opinion of the Committee, would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition,43. Having regard to all the conditions on which we are askedto report, we are of the opinion that the Applicants have succeeded in establishing a claim to a duty on the following classes or descriptions of goods^ via:-(a) Knives with one or more blades made wholly or partly of steel or iron,  other than surgical knives and knives for use in ma chine s,(b) Scissors,  including tailor&apos;s shears, and secateurs made wholly or partly of steel or iroru(c) Safety razors and parts thereof.(d) Other razors.(e) Carving forks.(f) Knife sharpeners of steel,ig)   Handles, blades and blanks for the above,In all the circumstances, we oonsider that a   duty of 55 l/3rdt per cent, ad valorem would be   reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition and we recommend that such a duty should be imposed for a period of at least fiveyears.
44, In conclusion it is a pleasure to record ourindebtedness to our Secretary,  Mr. G.S. Bailey,      His wide knowledge has been of great assistance to us and it is owing to his energy and industry that we have been able to complete our report very shortly after the close of the evidence.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed)    James Devonshire       (Chairman), M.
