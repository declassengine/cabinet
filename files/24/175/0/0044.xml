Decrease 944(378 men, 523 women, 43 juveniles)due mainly to increased employment, in the woollen and worsted trades at all these places. In addition, improved employment in the cotton trade at Halifax, in the wholesale clothing trade at Hebden Bridge, in the local collieries at Huddersfield, and in textile engineering at Keighley was also responsible for part of the decreases.

II. POSITION  IN   CHIEF  INDUSTRIES. COAL MINING.A further decline in employment took place during September, and in many districts more men were discharged or fewer shifts were worked. In certain instances pits producing&apos;house coal gave better employment, and in North and South Staffordshire an improvement was recorded. In Wales short-time working was general except in the anthracite districts.IRON AND STEEL.No substantial improvement was shown in the general employment position and short-time working was prevalent in most districts. Isolated instances of improved employment were reported from certain centres in the Midlands, and improvement of a more general character occurred in Wales in districts associated with tin-plate manufacture.TIN-PLATE TRADE.Employment in this industry continued to show steady improvement, and all centres in Wales, except Port Talbot, shared the resulting diminution of unemployment.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.There was a further decline in the shipbuilding industry during the month. Unemployment increased on the North-East Coast and a decline in ship-repairing was reported from Hull and Grimsby. Further discharges took place at Cowes (Isle of Wight), but better employment was afforded at Southampton. At the South Wales ports the position was very depressed. Little change occurred on the Mersey, but.ship joiners, were in steady demand there and at Barrow. Employment was slack at most of the Scottish centres, but some improvement was shown at Ardrossan and Port Glasgow.ENGINEERING.Motor, Cycle and Aircraft Engineering. Activity in the motor branch of the engineering industry still continued, apart from a normal seasonal slackening prior to the commencement of the 1926 programme, and the employment position was satisfactory, especially for skilled men. In aircraft engineering employment was fairly good, but the cycle trade showed seasonal slackness, especially in Birmingham.General. Employment showed on the whole a tendency to further slackness, although some slight improvement was reported from certain places in the Midlands. In textile engineering employment remained good, at Accrington and improved at Oldham, but there was no change in the Nortn-Eastern area, while at Long Eaton and Nottingham the trade was still depressed. Constructional engineers were more active at Stockton, Darlington and Leeds, while employment in locomotive building work remained good except at Springburn, where discharges took place. In agricultural engineering firms were well employed in the North-Western Counties, but agricultural implement makers at Banbury were still slack. Marine engineering still continued very depressed.TEXTILES.Cotton. Some improvement in this branch of the textile industry is indicated, particularly in the spinning section, but short-time working still continued. In the weaving section the depression continued. In the fine cotton spinning section employment was fair.Woollens and Worsteds. A considerable improvement in employment took place in Yorkshire, more particularly among women than men, firms apparently endeavouring to make up for time lost during the previous month, when the employ-ment position was affected by the trade dispute and by the annual holidays.   The
result has been the resumption of full-time working at many places rather than the engagement of additional operatives. There was; also a slight improvement in Scotland and in mid-Wales, but in the South-Western area there was a slight decline.Hosiery. No marked improvement was reported in this industry as a whole, but a slight improvement took place at Basford, Nottingham, Leicester and a number of other centres. In Scotland the improvement continued at Dumfries, and the position remained good at Hamilton.Lace. Little change occurred in this industry, and unemployment remained heavy. At Basford and Nottingham a slight improvement was reported, but at Beeston the plain net and curtain sections were held up by a temporary shortage of cotton. Short-time working continued at Derby, and no improvement was shown at Long Eaton and Ilkeston.Silk. The position remained generally unchanged. Employment at Cheadle was only fair and short-time working was still in operation at Leek. At Maccles-field employment was good. The artificial silk trade continued fairly busy at Derby, and at Nottingham continued expansion was reported. Proposals for the establish-ment of new factories for the manufacture of artificial silk are reported from a number of areas.Jute. In view of the continued rise in the price of jute, the position in the jute trade is stated to be uncertain, particularly in the case of firms with limited stocks of the raw material.Carpets. The depression continued in certain branches of the trade at Kidder-minster owing to a falling-off in&apos; the demand for the particular class of fabric manufactured. A slight improvement in carpet weaving was reported from Kilmarnock.*BUILDING. BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.In building, the activity previously shown continued, and employment remained good in most districts with skilled operatives. The demand for bricklayers, plasterers, joiners and masons still continued in excess of the supply, but there was a seasonal decline in employment for painters and decorators. In the brick and tile industry employment remained good.CLOTHING.In most areas seasonal slackness continued, but in London the West End tailoring and dressmaking trades continued to provide a brisk demand for workers. The shirt and collar trade continued fairly busy, but there was still short-time working in the corset industry.BOOT AND SHOE.Employment was still slack, and short-time working was in operation at many centres in the Midlands. Slight improvement is reported from Raunds, in the Wellingborough district, and from Leeds, G-uildford and Chesham. At Norwich there was a further decline, but little change occurred in the London area. The position at Bristol showed some slight improvement, but further depression was. reported from Street (Somerset). - In the slipper trade at Bacup and Rawtenstall a considerable amount of short time was still worked.POTTERY.A general improvement took place in North Staffordshire, although there wa still much unemployment and short-time working. At Hanley, further improve ment was recorded in the fireclay section, and in the first-class china section Unemployment decreased at Burslem, and labour was reabsorbed at Longton an Stoke-on-Trent    The position at Derby, Worcester and Basford was satisfactory.
DOCKS.Employment was subject to the usual fluctuations and showed little general change during the month. At Goole and Grimsby there was a greater volume of work, although of a casual nature, and increased employment was available at Hartlepool on cargoes of pit and sawn timber. At London Docks employment was good, particularly at Bermondsey and Stepney, while more employment was available at Dover and Yarmouth. Work at Weymouth declined, but employment was slightly better at Bristol and Avonmouth. In Wales employment was slack on the whole, although periods of spasmodic activity occurred at the various ports. On the Mersey some slackness was reported, but the importation of timber provided fairly steady employment at Manchester and Preston. Barrow, Whitehaven and Workington were affected by the curtailed trade in coal and iron.
III.-WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24)).]The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of liable. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes gut in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c., accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and Bridge Schemes assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception of certain road schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by the Ministry of Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Exchanges from Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned.It should be noted that in view of recent modifications in the scope of the table the figures given cannot properly be compared with those previously announced in Parliament in similar connections. The figures given for September 1924, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly. e.r/., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t No distinction is now made between the Forestry Commission^ normal and relief work, and g&apos;rants for afforestation form part of the normal programme. The average number of the Commission^ Forest Employees during the quarter ended September 30th, 1925, was 2,133 as compared with 1,761 for the corresponding quarter of 1924.$ These figures indicate men employed on the work itself. They include part only of the men employed on the manufacture of the materials used. They take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.
IY. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision  or furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment and should not be so regarded. It should be borne in mind that the excess of the total outward over the total inward movement from this country is somewhat less than 100,000 a year, and therefore small in comparison with the natural increase of population which for many years before and after the war has not been much less than 400,000 a year.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the months of July, August and September (with the corresponding figures for last year) and for the six months ended the 30th September, 1925 and 1924, respectively, are set out in the following Table : [137241

The Scheme, however, closed to new applications in December 1922.oto
Y. STATISTICS RELATING TO FINANCIAL PROVISION FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT (including Post-War Resettlement of ex-Members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces), from the Armistice.Schemes of which the Whole Cost is Borne by the Exchequer-Table 1. Out-of-Work Donation, Training Schemes, &amp;c.Schemes of which Part of the Cost is Borne by the Exchequer  Table 2. Unemployment Insurance.Table 3.

Trade Facilities Guaranteed Schemes.Other Schemes Table 7. Expenditure by Poor Law Authorities, A (England.and Wales), B (Scotland).These Statistical Tables have been compiled with a view to showing the extent of the effort from public sources since the Armistice to meet the problems of Post-War Resettlement and Unemployment, and to indicate the measure of assistance provided by the Exchequer. With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.

It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided (benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924 the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to October 3, 1925.Expenditure                    Benefit paid         ....          ....          .... 221,986,000Appropriation for Administration   .... 20,905,000Section 9 Unemployment InsuranceAct (No. 2), 1924         ....          .... 1,430,000Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;o.....          ....          .... 2,912,000--   247,233,000

To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Eoad Fund. 1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Year.

These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement.
