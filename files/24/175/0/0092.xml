fl Aii taReport cn the Position of the Coal Mining   ,Indust ry..No. 1      -     August - October, 1925*Trade.    The industry was steadily on the down-grade during th$ early simmer.     Even for the first quarter of the year all the exporting distxvicts showed debit balances, though profits in the Inland districts turned the balance of the industry as a whole into a credit of 6d.  a ton.      In April this was converted into a debit of 6d*, in May the debit was 7d., and in June nearly 2/-.      Anticipation of a stoppage in August caused some recovery in July,  and the debit balance in that month was only lifd. a ton.      &quot;When the threat was averted trade slumped heavily the debit balance in August was 2/9 a ton, and even aftes? payment of subvention the  industry had to make good a loss of 7&quot; Exports, which in 192.3 were 79,459,000 tons and in 1924 59*179)000 tons, were in August at the rate of less than 40,000,000 tons a year, and the f ,0-,&apos;b. value of export coal, which had fallen steadily from 20/10 in April to 2o/l  in July., fell iin August to 19/4*In September there was a recovery from the low level of August,      It  is true that, over the  industry as a whole in the month as a whole, prices were lower  (the pithead price of all coal was 16/1 as compared with l6/2 in August and 17/3 in July, and the f.o.b. value of export coal 18/9 as compared with 19/4, in July) but output and export rose by over 2,000,000 tons,, and over 600,000 tons respectively,  and the debit balance was 2/?4-d. a ton (reduced by subvention to %&amp;.  a ton).      During October the recovery was maintained.      *,7e do not yet know the average pithead price or the trading results,  but output was up hr nearly 2,000,000 as compared with September,  and exports by nearly 500,000,      The average f00cb. value of export coal however was  5d* lower at 18/4,      The results of the inland
I&quot;*:: ft f;; 5 0 5districts, when they.are available, may be expected to reflect the beginning of the normal seasonal improvement in domestic coal, which has been later than usual this year in setting, in, and possibly of some slight revival in trade generally.The only export market that shows real activity is that of Durham and Northumberland, where trade has been brisk for some weeks and quotations are now l/- or more above the worst. In South Wales,  owing to the American anthracite strike, the anthracite trade.has been very good, and there has been a demand for dry steam coals as a substitute,  &quot;but the market otherwise is heavy, and exports from Bristol Channel Forts in October (1-6 millions) were not far short of a million tons below the capacity of the coalfield.      The same is true of Scotland, whose exports  (700,000 tons) were over 300,000 tons below her capacityAn adverse factor that is likely to be increasingly serious in the exporting districts is the reluctance of colliery owners to enter into contracts beyond April.      In the Midland districts on the.other hand, collieries run less risk by doing so, and do not show 4uite the same hesitation.Cost of Subvention.The cost of subvention in any month depends, on two factors - (a) the gap that has to be filled between the guaranteed minimum level of wages and the level of the wages that the owners must under the recent settlement themselves bear (as    determined by trading results of a period of three months preoedihg- the month of payment  by an interval of a month) and (b) the number of man shifts on which subvention has to &quot;be paid, as determined by the demand for coal during the month of
payment and the number of working days in that month.In these circumstances it is obviously impossible to make any reasoned estimate of the cbtt in advance;    the only statement on the subject to which the lines Department stand committed is that made in the White Paper of the 4th August. This was to the effect that  if the subvention had been in operation in the similar period of 1924-5,- when the export market was less depressed than in the present year, it would have cost  7,500,000;    and that if it were based on June 192$, when inland prices were worse and export prices better than they might be expected to be this winter, the cost would have been  24,000,000.      Actually, the cost for the first four months is likely to be about  8:f- million.In August the wages payable by the owners were calculat-ed. on a period (April, May and June)  in which values had not fallen so low as they have since, and the number of man shifts worked in August itself was exceptionally low owing to bad trade.      The cost, of subvention was therefore comparatively light -  1,too.000.      Dor September the substitution of July for April in the period of calculation left the &quot;gap&quot; substantially the same, but the increased number of man shifts worked to produce the extra 2,000,000 tons increased the.cost of subvention by about  200f000.      In October the deplorable results of the month of August came into the. period of calculation for the first time and the &quot;gap&quot; was substantially increased,      This,  combined with a continued increase in output, has led to a sharp increase in the cost  of subvention, which is estimated to amount to  2,620,000 in October.      In November it is not likely to be less;      the month contains fewer working days, but the substitution of September for
June in the period of ascertainment has increased the !tgap&quot; slightly (except in the &quot;Eastern Area&quot;, where it is less^K    Jn December the substitution of October for July in the period of ascertainment will probably produce a further rise in the cost of subvention.    But In January the figure should be lower, for we shall then be rid of the incubus of August in the period of ascertainment, and, for the time at any rate,  the liability of the owners will be calculated on a period of improving,  instead of worsening,  trade.The follov/ing table shows the estimate of the amount of subvention passable in the principal districts up to the end of -November,0 The &quot;Eastern Area&quot; comprises Yorkshire, Notts, Derby, Leicestershire,  Warwickshire and Cannock Chase,  and produces nearly a third of the total output of Great Britain.

02S iB J:I?-..!?2..J*i?JESSZ*    -&apos;-s early as September informal overtures were made by an emissary of the viestphalion Syndicate, through an English intermediary,  as to the possibility of an apreeoent under which the normal exports of both countries to markets in which both are interested should be fixed at an agreed ratio, and the exports of both countries should be subject to a tax out of which a pool should be created to provide compensation to collieries detrimentally affected.    This suggestion obviously has enormous practical and political difficulties e,g0, the raising of prices against our former allies,  the limitation of our own exports in favour of Germany, and the competition from other coal-producing countries.    It ought nevertheless to be thoroughly explored.    Certain features of the suggestion in its original form were quite impossible from our point of view, and I asked the English intermediary to see  that the German emissary was informed that, while I should be glad to see him and  talk over the matter at any time,  his proposals as they stood could not possibly be put to the British Coal Trade.    For tactical purposes I impressed upon the English intermediary that he must on no account lead the Westphalian Syndicate to think that there was any eager-ness on this side, and the matter dropped for the momenta But all the evidence goes to show that Germany cannot compete with our recent prices, and there has recently been a renewal of overtures through the same channels.    I understand that the Ge&quot;rman emissary will be visiting England again shortly,and I hare said that I shall be glad to see him when he comes,Interpretation of__the....../Terms of Settlement. The. Minors1Federation have now practically abandoned their claim that tho terms of settlement meant that basis rates could not be altered,  and are pressing for a formal tripartite agreement between the Mines Department, Mining Association and themselves embodying the terms of settlement.    At their request I have invited the Mining Association to a joint meeting to
discuss the matter.    This invitation hes been refused on the ground that no good purposes would be served by a meeting,  since the association are not prepared to enter into a national agree-ment, although each district is prepared  to enter into the necessary agreement with its own men.    The point is a purely &quot;political&quot; one.    The continuance of national agreements is one of the chief planks in the Federation&apos;s programme;  the Association holds that their continuance is impossible and that wages must be settled by districts,  as they wore before the war,    Having, as they think, now secured the tactical advantage of a situation in which wages are regulated without any formal national agreement, they are not likely to be persuaded to forgo it.    The Miners1 Federation are net in a position to bring compulsion to bear on the owners; nor am I, although I think tho men are morally -though not practically - in the right, for an essential feature cf the settlement of last July was that the status quo should be preserved until May ne:t.    A deadlock has not yet been reached but I do not think one can be avoider*    I do not; however, antici-pate that the trouble will have any serious consequences:    the wages payable to the men are amply- secured and can at any moment he made the subject of district agreements.Progress of the Royal Commission.    The Hoyal Commission ,have taken a large amount of    oral evidence.    They ars also obtaining, by means of special returns from collieries, a great many statis-tics which will bo most valuable to them.    Their proceedings have been a good deal dolayed by the tendency of the representatives of both sides of tho industry to ask the witnesses propagandist rather than practical questions.    I understand that the Commission still hove some hope of finishing their oral evidence by Christmas although a good many important witnesses still remain to be hoards The framing of their report and recommendations of policy will obviously take a considerable time after  the hearing of evidence has been concluded,.
OPAL MIAING- INDUSTRY Positi on r a t the ja, n a ^ o ft h e ,,Jfrabyentiop Per ipd.During the conferences of Ministers that took place in the last week of July the importance was frequently emphasised of securing,  if possible, that a subsidy, if one were given, should fulfil two oonditions,  viz:    (a) that each side should be required to advance from the position that they were then taking up In order to narrow tho gap that the subvention had to fill, and (b) that the subvention should be &quot;tapered&quot; so that it should.come to an end naturally without a disturbing economic Jolt,But this, proved impossible; indeed. It is most. unlikely that any subsidy of this sort could have achieved the purpose for which the subsidy was eventually granted - viz; the avoidance of a stoppage in August,    In any case the terms in whioh the decision to grant a subsidy was announced ruled out those conditions.    The men were to be guaranteed their: existing wages system and hours until May;    the. owners wore to be &quot;seen through&quot; by the. Government until then.    Theowners claimed successfully that this pledge meant that they -should not be required to pay higher wages than thoy -had expressed their readiness to pay, and that the Government would make up the difference,I understand that the Cabinet,  in arriving at their -decision, to offer a subsidy in these terms were alive to the fact that they were in all probability merely postponing, and not averting,  a stoppage of work; but that they held that postponement was worth paying for in order that  fa) better preparation -might be made for carrying on essential services, and  (b)  the public, who on July 31st had not realised the imminence of the crisis might be better informed of the &apos;:true facts of the position by means of the Report of the Royal Commission,    I am not sure, however,  that it is still
fully realised how difficult the absence of any &quot;taper&quot; will make the,position at the end of ^pril,The position at the end of July was broadly this.In the Eastern Area, which depends mainly on the home market,  the economic position was not too bad.    Although the owners in this district fell into line with those in the rest of the country (and so missed what was,  from their point of view, a golden opportunity),  the wages that were then being paid were little,  if at all,  outside their general economic capacity, and there was a strong minority among them against terminating the Agreement at all0    In the great exporting districts - South $ales, Northumberland, Durham and Scotland - the owners argued convincingly that the maintenance of the existing wages and hours meant ruin to most of them.    The miners1 leaders, while secretly recognising the facts, know that no reduction in wages or increase in hours would be conceded by the men except after an unsuccessful stoppage, and  had no intention oi  committing official suicide by attempting the Impossible,There can be no good ground to hope that tho position at the end of April will be any different from this..    There may be some improvement In trade during the period of the subvention; indeed there is at the moment a brisk revival in Durham and Northumberland and some slight recovery in South Wales and Scotland from the very low level of August,    But this trade is being done at the substantially lower prices that the lower wages now being paid by the owners enable them to accept.    Short of some temporary cause of increased demand,, such as strikes ir; foreign coalfields,  it cannot ebe erpeoted. that by April our export cosl will command such a price as will enable the owners in the exporting districts to restore the pre-subvention wages.    The gap between the owners&apos;  and the meivs
r-&apos; A *3 3 1 position, which in July was measured by the owners&apos; losses, will in April be measured by the extent to which the wages of the men (as calculated on the owners&apos;  formula) have fallen below the July levels    (Already in South *vales they are below the pre-war rate).    The gap will still be there.Nothing that the Royal or.imission can do can make any difference to this.    Supposing that they recommend some system of compulsory amalgamation of collieries into a smaller number of larger units; perhaps also the nationalisa-tion of royalties.    Changes of organisation such as this would take a long time to bring into effect, and any eeonomic improvement that might result would bo a matter of years. The immediate effect of any suoh recommendations could onlybe to reinforce a demand that th    subsidy should be continued until they have been put into operation.    The Commission may also make the obvious recommendation that in the meantime the owners must pay something, more than they, were prepared to pay and the men take less than they were prepared to take., and, perhaps that the men should revert to an.eight hour day. Such o. recommendation would no doubt improve the position to the,extent that.public opinion would be against the side that stood, out. against it.    But it would not be likely to avert a stoppage,  for if the men&apos;s leaders were convinced last August that nothing could be yielded until the men had been got into the proper frame of mind by a stoppage, thoy will certainly not be less determined in April, with the recollection of their earlier success to give, them confidence.The position at the end of April 1926 will be not unlike the position at the en.: of March. 1221, when control came toan end.    At that timo also the .3astern Area were able to offer to continue (,for a time) even the high rates of wages-10-   . , ...
of the control period, but wages in the other districts wero being supported above their economic level by payments from the Sxohequer at the rate of about i-1,030,000 a week. It is to be hoped that in April nest the gap will not be of anything like that size but the situation can hardly fail to be much the same in essentials,.    In 1921 the Government realised that the abrupt withdrawal of this support would mean a bump that it was too much to ask the men to face, and offered, and eventually gave, a tapering subsidy for throe months to ease the transition..    A similar offer by the Government in April next, on condition that there is no stoppage of work, may well prove a political necessity, however improbable it may be that it will avail in 1926, any more than it did in 1921, actually to avert a stoppage.It is of course hardly possible to embark upon a definite policy for nesting tho situation until the Commission has reported *    But It is perhaps important that the necessary limitations on their power to relieve the immediate position should be recognised ih good time. Moreover, unless thoy report early in the year,  the Government might be forced to take some action in antloipa-tion of their report in order to dispel the uncertainty of the futures
