(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OB HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERIHJLNT) SECRET. COPY NO.   ^A)CP. 420(26)THE PRESENT IiAT7 IN REGARD TO SEDITION AND STRIKES. Memorandum by the Attorney General.1. In view of the present situation with regardto the Coal crisis I have thought it night bo useful for those of my colleagues who are not lawyers to have before them In simple language a statement of the present law as it affects the situation; and I have ventured to add one or two suggestions for thoir consideration as tothe linos on which amendment might be useful.2. There are two branches of the law which- have tobe considered(l) the power of the State to punish or prevent the preaching of revolutionary doctrine which might prevent any chance of a peaceful settlement,and(2) the limits within whioh a general strike in support of the minors demands is permissible.With regard to the first,  it is an indictableoffence to write or to utter a seditious libol, and itis likewise an indictable offence to enter into aseditious conspiracy-     Both offences can only bo tried by a jury.      In or&amp;ar successfully to prosecute it isnecessary to prove sedition.     Whether a combination isseditious or whether language is seditious is a question
of fact for the  jury before whom, the case is tried. The definition of sedition generally  riven to a jury is &quot;an intention to bring into hatred or contempt,  or to excite disaffection against tho person&apos; of His Majesty, his heirs or successors, or the government and constitution of the United Kingdom,, as by law established or cither House of Parliament,  or the administration of justice, or to excite His Majesty^ subjects to attempt otherwise than by lawful means, the alteration of any natter in Church or State by lav/ established, or to incite any person to commit any crime in disturbance of the peace,  or to raise discontent or disaffection amongst His Majesty!s subjects, or to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of such subjects.      An intention to show that His Majesty has been misled or mistaken in his measures,  or to point out errors or defects In the government or constitution as by law established, with a view to their reformat ion, or to excite His Majesty&quot;s subjects to attempt by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Church or State by law established,  or to point out,  in order to their removal, matters which are producing, or have a tendency to prodiice, feelings of hatred and ill-will between classes of His Majcsty&apos;s subjects,  is not a seditious intention.&quot; 3. It is obvious that very violent languageS.
might bo used and discontent mi .ht easily &quot;bo stirred up without - coming within this definition.. 4. One form of Communist activity is likelyto be the attempt to prevent the armed forces of the Crown from carrying out their duties in the event of a strike *     By the Incitement to Mutiny Act, 17c7, it is provided that &quot;any person who shall maliciously and advisedly endeavour to seduce any person or persons serving in Eis McjostyJs forces by soa or land from his or their duty arid allegiance to Eis Majesty, or to incite or stir up any such person or persons to commit any act of mutiny, or to iiiake or to endeavour to make any mutinous assembly,  or to commit any traitorous or mutinous practice whatcocvers shall on being legally convicted of such offence be adjudged guilty of felony&apos;1.      This offence canr of course, only be tried by a jury;.     It Is plain that great discontent might easily be stirred up in the forces without coming within the provisions, of this law. For instance,, suggestions to the rank and file-that they ought to hhv more- pay, more, privileges, and more fr-vcflora,  oven if couched in very offensive language would seem not to bo criminal unless they were accompanied by inoit* imnts to refuse to obey . ord..rp until the  dcimnds rrrc granted. 5o It is alro an offence at common law toincite other persons to commit crime;    and Communists who without i pproaohing c-olfl-.ro and sailors urged
other people to incite the forces of the Crown tomutiny would he guilty of a misdemeanour;    thisalso is only triable &quot;fay jury on indictment.6. Provided he abstains from these offencesthere is nothing to prevent a Communist from stirringup discontent or giving vent to the most revolutionarysent iment s.7. It is to be observed that much of this lawis archaic;    that it is not very easy to decide withprecision whether any particular language does ordoes not amount to sedition and that the necessity ofa jury trial  involves very considerable delay before a conviction can be obtained.    But  it is obvious thatany amendment to the law must be very carefully considered.It is essential to avoid any undue interference withthe liberty of speech;    and any proposal which avoidstrial by jury is bound to be very jealo^csly scrutinised.8. In considering whether any amendment  ispossible or advisable I have endeavoured to ascertain the state of law in our Dominions, and  I have obtainedcopies of the statutory provisions in Canada and australia which form Annex I and II to this Memorandum.9. I have also obtained a copy of a draft Billprepared in 1921 entitled &quot;a Bill for the  reservation of Public Order&quot; which forms Annex III,10, During the war-there was in force a very valuable Regulation under the Defence of the Realm Actsknown as Regulation 42, of which I attach a copy.   (Annex IV).This Regulation is substantially reproduced in paragraph1(d) of the 1921 Draft Bill, but the other provisionsof the Bill, which in effect provide a summary remedy for sedition, and penalise the publication or
distribution of seditious documents,,  or membership ofseditious societies,  or the obtainingof financial help for seditious purposes from abroad,and give power of search, are also valuable.11. I should like if practicable to see this branch of the law strengthened(i) by enacting a law substantially in the form of the 1921 Draft Bill.(ii) by incorporating a statutorydefinition of sedition somewhat on the lines of the Australian Statute (passed there by a Labour Government).12. On the second subject under discussion,namely,&quot;the limit within which a general &quot;strike in support of the miners&apos; &quot;demandc is permissible.&quot;the matter must be considered from the point ofview of the criminal and the civil 1-a.wv13. Under the criminal law there is nothingillegal in a strike, by which I mean a combination of workmen to refuse to continue work, whetherthe strike is in furtherance of some trade disputeof their own,  or whether the strike is sympathetic;-and by statute an agreement or combination by two or more persons to do,  or procure to be done,any act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute,  is not  indictable as a conspiracy if suchact committed by one person would not bepunishable as a crime.
in the supply of gas, water, or electricity to break his contract if he knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, that the probable consequence will be to deprive the public wholly or to a great extent of their supply of gas, water, or electricity, or for any person wilfully and maliciously to break a contract of service knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the probable consequence of his so doing, either alone or in combination with others, will be to endanger human life or to cause serious bodily injury, or to expose valuable property to destruction or serious injury.      It is an offence for any person to intimidate or to use -vdalence, or to hide people&apos;s clothes or other property, or to watch or beset the residence or place of work of any other person in order to compel such person to abstain from work.     It is not an offence to picket in order peacefully to persuade any person to abstain from work.     It is notorious that &quot;peaceful picketing&quot; in any big strike is in fact used to carry on the most effectual intimidation.15. Civilly it is actionable to break a contract of employment;    but although it ic actionable in ordinary cases to induce another person to break a contract of employment, by the Trades Disputes Act,-6-
1906, this is not actionable if done in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute.    By the s;me Act of P; rli?. nent Tr. dos Union funds are not liable for any damages for wrongs committed by - c Trades Union or by its agents.    There is no cause of action for merely refusing to enter into or renew a contract of employment,16.      The result is that if a. trade dispute exists -and in these cases it always does - in practice it is impossible to prevent intimidation ind neither the Trades Unions nor their officials can be rendered liable for th 3 damage which is done. 17.      I find the greatest difficulty in deciding what alter fit. ion is possible;    from our own supporters the popular cry is for the repeal of the Trades Disputes Act of 1906.    This I think impossible; however undesirable end unconstitutional the Act may be, it is regarded by all the Trades Unions as their Magna Charta and any attempt to repeal It would bo considered by the viihole body as an attack upon the trades unions and would rally all trades unionists to support the extremists.10.    I should like to render illegal any strike which is directed against the State and not against the employers, but so far I have not been able to frame a satisfactory form of words which would not unduly limit and interfere with industrial disputes, and I doubt whether -it is possible to find such a form.    It has occurred to me that it may perhaps be possible to limit the protection afforded by the
Trades Disputes Act to actions done solely in furthcrsnce of trade disputes *    This would have the effect of rendering Trades Union officials and funds liable if the act was otherwise actionable and the jury held that it was done purely for political or nalicious ends.    But such an amendment would have to be very carefully considered before it was adopted by the Government.19.    I think it might be advisable to extend theprovisions which I have quoted about gas, water, and electricity to the transport services.    This wouldprohibit the &quot;lightning strike&quot; end give moro timefor preparation^    I think this would be valuablebut it doos not fully meet the situation.2Q,    Prom the above summary of the law cry colleagues will see that there are matters which in my judgmentneed amendment, but that the framing of the amendmentsis a matter of extreme difficulty.    I would suggestfor their consideration whether a small Committee ofthe Cabinet experienced both in law and in administrationcould not be set up in order to consider the desirabilityof the amendments which I have suggested.(Intdo)    BoMoE.-Eoyal Courts of Justice, 9th October, 1925.
