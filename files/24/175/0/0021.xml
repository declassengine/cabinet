[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1925.SECRET. Copy No.   30CP. 421/25.CABINET.AIR FORCE EXPANSION FOR HOME DEFENCE.Previous Papers: OP. 88 (23), 270 (23), 271 (23), 294 (23), 296 (23), 310 (23), 461 (23), Part VI, 82 (24), 119 (24), 153 (24).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. So many and grave issues are involved in the policy of Air Force Expansion: that my colleagues will expect to have a statement of the present position and any proposals that I may make in connection with the programme that we are at present carrying out.2. The members of the last Conservative Government will remember the long and detailed enquiry undertaken by the Committee of Imperial Defence and the subsequent approval by the Cabinet of its unanimous recommendation to create a Home Defence Force of 52 squadrons. It was found that, whatever process of calculation was adopted, French air strength in France was fifteen times greater than British air strength in Great Britain. So serious a position compelled the Cabinet, upon the 20th June. 1923, to agree to the following resolutions : &quot; (a.) That, though regarding it as a melancholy necessity, they had no alternative but to approve the Interim Report, the recommendations of which are as follows : -(1.) In addition to meeting the essential Air Power requirements of the Navy, Army, Indian and overseas commitments (in regard to which a report will be furnished later), British Air Power must include a Home Defence Air Force of sufficient strength adequately to protect us against Air attack by the strongest Air Force within striking distance of this country.(2.) That the Air Staff be instructed to draw up detailed proposals for the-creation of such a Home Defence force, to be organised in part on a regular and permanent military basis, and, in part, on a volunteer or reserve basis, but so arranged as to ensure that sufficient strength will be immediately available for purposes of defence. The fullest possible use to be made of civilian labour and facilities.(3.) That the first stage of the Air Ministry&apos;s scheme, which will absorb our entire capacity for aerial expansion in the immediate future, should provide; for a strength of 600 first-line machines that is to say, a number of machines; equal to the Independent Striking Force of the strongest Air Force within striking distance of this country.The details of this stage should be arranged with a view to the possibility of subsequent expansion, but, before any further development is put in hand, the question should be re-examined in the light of the then Air strength of foreign: - Powers.&quot; &apos; -These decisions the Prime Minister announced in the House of Commons on-the 26th June, 1923. Since then the Air Ministry have been engaged upon carrying this policy into effect.[13637]
3. The following table shows in terms of first-line machines the relative position in March 1923, when the OLD. enquiry took place, at the present time, and in each subsequent year up to the probable date of the completion of the programme: Table showing First-Line Machines stationed in British Isles and France respectively (exclusive of Machines for Naval Co-operation).		1.		2.		3.	4.			i.Date.

British Army Co-operation aircraft, on the other hand, besides being greatly inferior in number are unsuitable for use in a bombing attack against France.. It will be noted that whilst the French machines are all regular units, 25 per cent, of the British units are non-regular, and consequently of less military value. It will also be noted that I have assumed that the French, although their strength is actually greater than it was in 1923, will not carry into effect the further programme that has already been before the Chamber of raising their Army Air Service to 2,008 machines. I have also assumed that our programme, which was originally to be completed in 1928, will not be finished until 193C4. The table shows that at present we are in an inferiority of somewhat less than 1 to 3 in Home Defence machines and somewhat more than 1 to 3 if Army Co-operation machines are taken into account. The position, therefore, whilst substantially better than that of two years ago, is still disquieting and unsatisfactory. Moreover, continuous developments in air. warfare make the danger of attack more terrible. My colleagues will find a mass of formidable evidence in this connection when they come to study the recent reports of the Committee of Imperial Defence upon Air Raid Precautions and other cognate subjects.5. Whilst the figures of the summary show that the military position has developed in accordance with the forecast of 1923, two factors, not indeed new, but become more prominent, have emerged during the last two years. In the first place, there is the increasing urgency for reduction of expenditure, and, in the second place, there are the better relations between ourselves and France exemplified in the substitution of M. Briand for M. Poincare.6. To the first of these factors, the need for the reduction of expenditure, and particularly expenditure upon armaments, I am as keenly alive as any of my colleagues. That the Air Force expansion is being carried out in a remarkably economical manner is proved by the fact that in the short period of a few years we are trebling the size of one of the fighting forces, with prices high and an almost total lack of barrack accommodation, at an increase of some 50 per cent, over the pre-expansion figure. None the less, I look with anxiety and reluctance at estimates that are constantly rising. I am continuously asking myself and my advisers as to whether, and if so, where, we can avoid expenditure. In the interests of economy we have introduced into our scheme non-regular and civilian elements, we have cut
out of it new flying training schools, we have delayed the introduction of new types of machines and the building up of reserves, and we are in the process of reviewing the establishments of all the principal Air Force stations. Ought we to go further and delay still longer the completion of the expansion ?- As I am asking for the answer of my colleagues to this question, I will not prejudge my own. I will only say that it may be found upon examination that delay will mean increased expenditure. Nor will I prejudge the answer to the further question if there is to be a slowing down of defence expenditure, would not retrenchment be better applied in directions other than the defence of London and the Metropolitan area from the possibility of appalling air attacks? Here again, however, I shall welcome the views of my colleagues upon a question that raises issues so important.7. Then there is the second factor that has come into prominence, the factor of our better relations with France. I readily admit the change, and I believe that if the Tripartite Pact is carried through, a great stimulus will be given to the movement for the reduction of armaments. It is not, therefore, because I wish to underrate the magnitude of the improvement or the urgency of the question of disarmament that I draw my colleagues&apos; attention to two considerations. In the first place, the history of the years immediately subsequent to.the armistice shows the danger of sudden reversals of policy. Many of my problems, and a substantial amount of my expenditure, have been due to changes that, having reduced the strongest air force in the world to one of the weakest, almost as suddenly reverted to a programme of building up again what had previously been broken down.8. There is a further consideration that should be taken into account. Setting aside the contingency, remote as I hope it to be, that our relations with France may once again become strained, I would point to the fact that the French Government has not shown the least inclination to reduce its own Air Force. The relations between England and France are as friendly as they could He, Germany is altogether deprived of an Air Force, yet France continues to maintain an air strength more predominant than was ever her military strength under Napoleon or Louis XIV. Are we justified in remaining for many years in a position of such numerical inferiority in air strength ? Ought we not in any case to seize the chance provided by the Pact Negotiations to bring pressure upon the French to reduce their armaments ? Is it not wiser to follow the successful precedent of the Washington Conference and to approach them with our programme of expansion definite and intact, rather than with the public admission that on grounds of economy we are anyhow going to postpone it ? These considerations must be carefully weighed when decisions are taken as to our Air Force policy. They are certainly considerations about which I should welcome the views of my colleagues.9. It is on this account that I suggest that a Cabinet Committee should be appointed to survey the present position. The question raises issues of high policy and wide reactions. In principle, at least, it does not seem to me to differ from the enquiry that was undertaken by the Cruiser Committee. Would it be possible for the non-service members of the Cruiser Committee to meet again and to consider the cognate question of our air defence programme ? The enquiry need not be protracted, and its findings would greatly help me in dealing with the problems, some of them very urgent, that at present confront me. If my suggestion of such a committee is found impracticable, I must press the Cabinet for an early decision upon the main lines of our policy. Half the Expansion Scheme is now completed, many commitments have been entered into, contracts have been let, personnel engaged. The programme will not only be dislocated, but much public money wasted if decisions are not quickly reached upon the main lines of our future policy.S. II.,Secretary of State for Air.Air Ministry, October 1925.
