It would, not therefore be possible at the Conferenoe to consider in any detail any questions arising out of the transfer of those services which were under the control of the Government of Northern Ireland.Ministers that while no doubt &quot;it would be desirable to discuss in as full detail as possible the steps to be taken with regard to the reserved services (i.e. the services which in Northern Ireland remain under the control- of the Imperial Government) he was not in a position to enter into any final or binding agreement with regard to these services.The reprasseataiives of His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrior to the Conference, Mr. Amery privatelyMr, Amery further explained to the Free State
The Free State Ministers informed l&apos;.Ir, Amery that while the Free State Government were prepared to assume,  for the purposes of the present conference,  that the Boundary Commis-sion had power to transfer areas of the Irish Free State to northern Ireland, they had argued before the Commission that the Commission had no such power,,    If the Commission upheld the view put before them by the Free State Government, no question of any transfer of territory from the Free State to Northern Ireland would of course arise;    if the Commission did not uphold that view, any arrangements which might be provisionally ms.de at the Conference to effect such a transfer would presumably operate,The officials were then called in.The general principles which should govern(a) the transfer of staff(b) the transfer of assets and liabilities, and(c) agency services rendered by one Government on behalf of another in any area transferred from one jurisdiction to another wereprovisionally settled and embodied in an agreed memorandum..The detailed steps necessary to be taken for thechange-over In any transferred area of(a) Postal services(b) Inland Revenue services, and(c) Customs and Excise services were also provisionally settled and embodied in agreed memoranda aMr, 0&apos;Hlggins then raised the question of the prsser--vat ion of law and order in the transferred areas and on the border generally.      He appreciated that the solution of this question must depend to a considerable degree on the extent to which the Government of Northern Ireland was prepared to participate actively in carrying the determination into effect;    but the question could not be passed over entirely.
^ 5&quot; K 3 3without discussion.      Before the Free State could take over the responsibility for the preservation of law and order in any area transferred to them,  it was necessary that the R.U.C. barracks in that area should be evacuated in order that they might be available for the accommodation of the Civic Guard; and also that the Special Constabulary should be disarmed.    It would in his opinion be altogether undesirable that the task of disarming the Special Constabulary should be fc&amp;dartaJcen by the incoming Free State authorities; that task should be undertaken by the British authorities. In fact the free State Government would loon to the British Government to secure a peaceful and orderly transfer of territory in accordance with the determination of the Commission.    They recognised that this night well mean a period of delay after the date of determination before the actual transfer of the territory concerned was effected.      They acquiesced in this and indeed urged that there should be no hurry to withdraw British troops from the areas transferred.Mr. Amery said that he understood that Mr. 01Higgins&apos; view was that the Free State authorities should take over the areas transferred to them from the British troops and hot from the Northern Ireland Police.      He assumed that the same principle would be observed in the case of transfers from the Free State to northern Ireland and on that understanding he concurred.Mr.01Higgins agreed,  subject to the general reserva-tion as to the powers of the Commission already mentioned., iiot only did the Free State Government desire to take over from British troops rather than from northern Ireland Police,, but they thought that it would be well if,  even after the final transfer had been effected, British troops should be available to act  in aid of the Free State civil power if
necessary,      If any trouble should arise after the final transfer,.it would,  in his opinion, be far better that  it should be dealt with by British rather than by Free State troops..      These  observations were based on the assumption that the R.U.C.   Would Toe withdrawn by their own authorities from, any transferred area on or very shortly after the date of determination,      Of course if they were not so withdrawn a very difficult situation might arise.    It might be neoesbary for the Free State Government to consider whether it would be possible for them ot undertake any civil administrative duties in the transferred areas until the final transfer had been effected.     He felt that a clear pronouncement by the British Government as to the policy which they meant to pursue in such a case was very desirable.Mr. Amery said that  if such a situation arose the ritish Government would have to consider what action they must take,      It did not  see possible however to  carry the matter further at the present moment.The quest ion of prisoners held in custody in a transferred area,  or convicted or awaiting trial in respect of an offence committed in such an area, was then considered. It was agreed that a solution oould hardly be reached without consultation with the Government of Northern Ireland,      Meanwhile the legal advisers on both sides would further consider the matter.minions Office,  S.W.I.
