ARBAKGEMITKYS FOB GjraiOFfJOT -JO AN AWARD OP TBS IRISH BOUNDARY -COMlilSRIG-IT.Memorandum by the Secretaries of State for the Home Department and for Dominion Affairs,We.do not know when the award of the Commission may be expected, but there was reason some weeks ago for believing that it Blight be issued at any time after the end of October and communications were then exchanged with the Free State Government as a result of which a Conference with Free State Ministers will take place on the 29th of this month for the purpose of discussing and if possible settling the arrangements for giving affect to any changes of boundary that- may be decided upon.The details of the necessary arrangements as they affect the various services have been worked out by representatives of the Departments concerned and we anticipate no difficulty in arriving at an agreement with thy free State Government on such points of detail.,    in spite of the fact that the Northern Government have declined to co-operate in drawing up any plans until they know what tho award of tho Commission is and the arrangements affecting transferred services have accordingly had to be worked out on a provisional basis by the Departments in London,,We do not think the Cabinet need be troubled with any of the administrative details.      The question upon which we desire to consult them is entirely one of policy..   &apos; Both the British and the Free State Governments have been advised that tho award of the Commission will be legally operative as soon aa it is marie.
a 9 -hThe Commission have been so informed &quot;out we have no doubt that they woula he billing if a request in that sense were m-ade to them by both Governments to give a fa)-? ueeks&apos; prior notice of the main features of their intended findings.     The g/ueation is whether we should endeavour to get the Free State Government at the approaching Conference to join with us in asking for such notice or whether we should rely upon being able to carry out the determination promptly and effectively without any foreknowledge ox its details.Our departmental advloers take the view that the chances of effecting the change smoothly would be greatly improved if the utmost speed were ueed and no details were allowed to become known prior to the issue of the formal determination.      They have arrived at this conclusion upon the assumption that the award will contain nothing whioh would be regarded as constituting an indefensible invasion of the rights, of Northern Ireland but that it will inevitably cause annoyance to a great many people on both sides of the border who will employ any period of delay before the actual transfer ia effected in a vigorous agitation against the award and in devising means to thwart any measures for carrying it into execution.We fully realise the administrative advantages of the -course indicated but in view of the history of the whole business, from the time of the signing of the Treaty without the further consultation with Sir James Craig which had been promised, we feel that it would be politically impossible to take action which might not unfairly be described as &quot;jumping the claim&apos;1&quot; without at least an assurance of the acquiescence of Sir James Craig, who so far has firmly declined to commit himsel in any way.      The fact that the departmental plans contemplate the temporary employment of British troops to keep order in any area affected by the award from which a considerable number of police have to be withdrawn greatly strengthens us in this
Without Sir James Oraig&apos; s acquiescence, we must, weare convinced, face the disadvantages of prior publicity (for if the main features of the award are made known to theGovernments as we.suggest, they will certainly leak out) and endeavour to arrange for the Commission to give  the main features of their contemplated award some time before theyissue it as a formal determination.     We propose to discusstho matter on this footing at Thursday&apos;a Conference andhave every expectation that Frwe State Ministers will agreeprovided that we give them the assurance, for which theywill undoubtedly ask, that the British Government have noother thought than to carry out the award of the Commissionto the letter.      Such an assurance is of course nothing new and -would be given in the expectation that the award,however unpalatable in Northern Ireland, will be one which public opinion here would accept.      If this expectationwere falsified and the award were manifestly one which couldnot be carried out without grave risk of widespreaddisorders and possibly bloodshed, we shomld still be free to point out to the Free State that in the interests ofIreland as much as of this country decisive action couldnot immediately be taken and that, while fully recognisingour obligations, we must have time to cast about for meansof discharging them without entailing such consequences as no responsible Government could deliberately co  template.We desire that our colleagues should be aware ofthe basis upon which we propose to negotiate with the FreeState and should be glad to have their general approval ofthe lines of policy indicated In this memorandum.Kitiy ;v&apos;:iA-my&apos;&apos;fW.J.H.
