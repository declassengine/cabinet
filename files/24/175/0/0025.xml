SECRET. CopyCP. 425 (25 .CABINET.RATES OF PAY OF NEW ENTRANTS IN THE FIGHTING SERVICES.------- /Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. In accordance with my colleagues&apos; wishes I circulate the following brief note in reference to the memorandum (No. CP. 415 (25) ) of the Secretary of State for War, in which he states that, unless the Royal Air Force &quot; will reduce their rates to correspond &quot; with the new Army rates, an increase in these latter will, in his opinion, be necessary.2. The revised Air Force rates, which were, of course, submitted to and approved by the Cabinet Committee on Pay, have already, with the assent of the Treasury, been made public. They are in consequence no longer &quot; proposed &quot; rates and there can be no question of their reduction. I need not, therefore, elaborate the basis on which they were calculated, but will only say that it is the considered opinion of my advisers, in the light of the experience of the past few years, that they are the minima which will secure us the type of recruit we require. My colleagues will not need to be reminded that any knvering of the standard of technical skill of our mechanics might compromise the safety of our flying personnel.3. It is for the Secretary of State for War to prescribe the rates necessary for Army personnel.I must, however, point out that, though the comparative table in CP. 415 (25) correctly states the revised rates payable in the Army and Air Force respectively, the figures are somewhat misleading without further explanatory comment.Thus, as regards the pay of a Private, Class I, and a Leading Aircraftsman, it is necessary to emphasise that the former gets a rise of Is. per diem after three years in the service. Unless, therefore, the Privates, Class I, in the Army get their promotion very quickly, the large majority are presumably on the 5s 3d. rate, and that rate, not 4s. 3d., should be compared with the Leading Aircraftsman&apos;s 5s. Qd. rising to 6s. after three years, not in the service, but in the grading. If the Secretary of State for War&apos;s proposal to increase the pay of Army Privates, Group A, to 6s. after three years in the service were adopted, approximate equality would not result, but the Army would obviously be in a more favourable position than the Air Force, since a Leading Aircraftsman will not reach this figure until he has served three years in the grading.Again, I may point out that the Air Force, unlike the Army, has no Lance-Corporals.4. I suggest, however, that these and other points of detail are hardly susceptible of discussion in Cabinet. Moreover, it is clear that the Committee which examined this question, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary for Scotland, took the view that exact relativity between the three Services was impracticable. I concur in this view and would deprecate strongly any attempt to secure such exact relativity. Were it to be made, the Navy and no objection has so far been taken by the Admiralty to the revised Air rates is in a position far more analogous to that of the Air Force than is the Army.5. I am not competent to say whether, once the somewhat misleading comparison with the revised rates for airmen has been set aside, the increases for Army personnel proposed by the Secretary of State for War are justified on the merits of the case; certainly I shall not oppose them on the ground of possible reactions on the Air Force.S.
