&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.,]       ^ Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.-Circulated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.VO&apos;&quot;*94 5 4REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS. --&quot;2LT its meeting on the 29th July the Cabinet approved a note by Sir Maurice Hankey containing suggestions as to the procedure to be followed in pursuing enquiries into the question of our obligations in the matter of the reduction of armaments.Since that note was written, and circulated to the Service Departments, the question of disarmament has been further considered by the Assembly and Council of the League of Nations, whose conclusions were embodied in the following resolutions :- &quot; The Assembly,&quot; Taking note of the declarations submitted to the Council and the Assembly of the League of Nations in respect of the Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes and of the fact that the said Protocol has not up to the present received the ratifications necessary for putting it into operation immediately;&quot; Convinced that the most urgent need of the present time is the re-establishment of mutual confidence between nations;&quot; Declaring afresh that a war of aggression should be regarded as an international crime:&quot; Regards favourably the effort made by certain nations to attain those objects by concluding arbitration conventions and treaties of mutual security conceived in the spirit of the Covenant of the League of Nations and in harmony with the principles of the Protocol (Arbitration, Security, Disarmament);&quot; Records the fact that such agreements need not be restricted to a limited area, but may be applied to the whole world;&quot; Recommends that, after these conventions and treaties have been deposited with the League of Nations, the Council should examine them in order to report to the Seventh Assembly on the progress in general security brought about by such agreements;&quot; Undertakes again to work for the establishment of peace by the sure method of arbitration, security and disarmament;&quot; And, in conformity with the spirit of Article 8 of the Covenant, requests the Council to make a preparatory study with a view to a Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments in order that, as soon as satisfactory conditions have been assured from the point of view of general security as provided for in Resolution XIV of the Third Assembly, the said Conference may be convened and a general reduction and limitation of armaments ma)&apos;&apos; be realised.&quot;&quot; The Council,&quot; In view of the Report of the Third Committee to the Sixth Assembly and of the resolutions adopted by the Assembly relating to arbitration, security and disarmament, dated the 2&apos;5th September, 1925;&quot; Decides to refer the report, resolution and minutes of the Assembly, of the Third Committee and of the Sub-Committee of the Third Committee to the Committee of the Council for examination, asking it to meet as soon as possible during the interval between the September and December sessions in order &quot; (1.) To examine the observations made during the Sixth Assembly relating to the constitution and working of the Co-ordination Committee and submit definite proposals to the Council on the following questions : &quot; (a.) The composition and name of the Co-ordination Committee. &quot; (&amp;.) Status of its different members. &quot; (c.) Procedure. 3122   [13761]
.t ^\ make the necessary studies for determining the questions which need to be submitted to a preparatory study with a view to a possible conference for the reduction and limitation of armaments, and to draft definite proposals to be submitted to the Council on this subject.&quot; The Committee of the Council is asked to submit a report on this&quot;matter in time for examination by the Council at its session in December.&quot;The position consequently is that the preparatory work which is necessary before any general conference on the reduction of armaments can be held is to be put in hand at once, so that there may be no delay in holding a conference immediately the utility of that step appears assured by the requisite, improvement in the general state of security.The lines on which this preparatory work should be conducted are to be decided by the Council after hearing the advice of its committee a body known as the Committee of the Council and composed of one representative of each State member of the Council), which is to meet as soon as possible and make its recommendations to the Council at the latter&apos;s next session in December. The work is then to be entrusted to the body hitherto known as the Co-ordination Committee, but the latter is first to undergo reorganisation at the hands of the Council, who in this also are seeking the advice of-their committee.As at present constituted, the Co-ordination Committee is composed of the Committee of the Council, assisted, in an advisory capacity, by (1) representatives of the three technical organisations of the League (Financial, Economic and Transit Committees), (2) representatives of the Permanent Advisory Committee (the committee composed of advisers, appointed by their Governments, in naval, military and aerial matters), (3) representatives of both employers&apos; and workers&apos; groups of the governing body of the International Labour Office, (4) experts, jurists and others, appointed by the Council. Hitherto, only the members of the Council Committee have had the right of vote, but there is a strong movement in favour of extending that right to other members of the Co-ordination Committee, under its reorganisation, and, to some extent also, in favour of broadening the composition of the Committee. I consider the Committee, even as now constituted, to be very ill-adapted to so difficult a task, and I share the objection which is, I believe, felt by the Service Departments to its expansion. The British representative on the Committee of Council may be able, when the time comes, to do something to enforce this point of view, but he may be overridden and obliged to yield to a general consensus of opinion.Of far greater importance is the question upon what lines the preparatory work is to be conducted, and here the British representative must be given considered advice. The signature of the Treaty of Locarno and subsidiary instruments will probably be held to justify the summoning of a conference. It is therefore important that the preparatory work should be based on safe lines so that it shall not result in yet another large and ambitious but abortive scheme. Real progress ought now to be possible. The danger is lest once again the League should lose touch with realities, nations give lip-service to principles which they have no real intention of acting up to, and Great Britain be left to say the truth which many feel, but no one else has the courage to utter.I should like, therefore, to be in a position to give the Council or its Committee a clear idea of what we think practicable, and incidentally, perhaps even inferen-tially, of what we think impracticable. Our prestige is now high; our opinion and advice will have weight and our attitude may be decisive, as it was at and before Locarno, but only if, as at Locarno, we know clearly what we want and exactly what ive are prepared to do.What I would therefore ask the Cabinet to approve is that the work which by their direction the Service Departments are already engaged upon should be continued with particular reference to the Assembly and Council resolutions and with a special view to giving the British representatives on the Council and its Committee a definite line of policy.It may well be that the Service Departments should continue each to tackle the problem in the first instance from its own standpoint, but the result of their labours should be made available as soon as possible and be considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence. The C.I.D. would then submit to the Cabinet draft instructions for the guidance of the British representatives.A. C.October 31, 1925.
