HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERHMBHT)IsCRET. C OPY No. ; c     CABINET. ---1J,p. 476(25).ECONOMIES IN EDUCATIONAL EXPENDITURE.MEMORANDUM by the PRESIDENT of. the BOARD OF EDUCATION.I hare under consideration certain economies in educational expenditure which will be necessary in view of the financial position and I have come to the conclusion that these economies cannot be carried out unless a Bill is passed by Parliament early next year raising the school age to six.     This would not necessarily entail the exclusion of children under six from the schools, but it would give parents freedom not to send their children to school until they reached the age of six and it would enable Local Authorities to exclude children under six should they desire to do so.It may be necessary to announce this policy at an early date and I shall be glad if the Cabinet will give me authority to do so.E.P.16 s11.25 *
