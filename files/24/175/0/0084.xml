November 1925. .SECRET. . &apos;?   . ,, &apos;CP. 484 (25). . y.s\u.memorandum on the Abolition of the Indian CottonExcise Duty. ,o 0CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I circulate a telegram from the Viceroy dated 15th November (Appendix I) in which the immediate abolition of the Indian cotton excise duty is proposed&apos;. ;First imposed about 80 years ago on free trade principles and against the wishes of the Government of India, this duty has always been bitterly resented in India and has clone more harm to the British connection than almost any other act of the Imperial Government. From 1896 onwards the excise was a countervailing duty equivalent to the import duty, but in 1917 a departure from free trade principles was made when the import duty was raised to 7-1- per cent, ad valorem, the excise-remaining unchanged at per cent. ; and in 1921, when the import duty was further raised to II per cent., the excise was not increased.For many years past the Government of India have declared their intention of doing away with this duty as soon as financial conditions permitted ; and as, since-the introduction of the Reforms, India enjoys fiscal autonomy, this declaration has greater weight now than when the assurance was first given by Lord Hardinge in 1916. The substantial surplus of last year was utilised for the reduction of provincial contributions, which was regarded as a prior obligation ; but it has been taken for granted that, if at the next Budget financial conditions permit, the cotton excise will be abolished , and, as stated in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram, the Government of India some three months ago came to the tentative conclusion that, unless financial conditions rendered it impossible, that step would be taken in the Budget for 1926-7. The present proposal is merely to anticipate that decision by four months, and,, although ordinarily it is undesirable to reduce taxation except at Budget time, the Viceroy believes that the relief given to the cotton industry, by the immediate abolition of the duty would bring to an end the widespread and disastrous strike in Bombay; In September last the Legislative Assembly adopted.., a resolution to suspend the-duty, and there can be no doubt that its abolition would be welcomed in India.In 1917 and again in 1921 Lancashire objected to the increase in the import duty &apos; without a corresponding increase in the excise. The views of the British cotton manufacturers have, however, changed ; and I understand that their leaders are not now likely to object strongly to the abolition of the excise, not merely because they know that the duty must go, but also because they recognise that any opposition on their part would prejudice their claim to favourable treatment by India in the future. They have now come to see that the field of effective competition between Lancashire and Bombay is extremely limited, and that their most serious competitor in the Indian , market is Japan. It is evidence of the changed conditions that Mr. VVadia, who headed the deputation of the Bombay mill-owners to the Viceroy a. few months ago, has recently visited Lancashire ; and I understand that the British manufacturers are now fully alive to the dangers of Japanese competition and have decided, in concert with Bombay, to endeavour to persuade India to protect both Lancashire and Bombay against Japan. What the outcome of this may be I cannot sajr, but it is, at all events, so much to the good that British and Indian manufacturers are working together.I have consulted the President of the Board of Trade, and I understand his view to be that it would be unreasonable, and indeed impossible, to refuse to agree to the Viceroy&apos;s proposal.I append a draft reply to the Viceroy&apos;s telegram (Appendix II), which will be considered by my Council on Tuesday, and I have no reason to suppose that they will not agree with my view that the proposal of the Viceroy should be accepted. I propose, unless any of my colleagues in the meantime object, to send a telegram in the sense Of this draft on Thursday, 26th November.birkenhead.20th November 1925. -814      100   11.25
- APPENDIX I.Telegram from Viceroy, Finance Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated Ibth November 1925. &apos;We have again had under consideration the- cotton excise- duty.. It will be remembered that, after full consideration of Lord&quot; Harclinge&apos;s pledge, we decided, in -connection with the last budget, to retain the duty this year and give preference to the reduction of provincial contributions. Assembly may be said to have supported this view, though at the same time it demonstrated in favour of the abolition of the cotton excise duty.21 During the last eight months the position of the&apos; cotton mill industry has -steadily deteriorated&apos;. This was- not unanticipated,&quot; but the&apos; extent of the depression in Bombay; if not of actual- sin hip, is even greater than could be fully realised in -advance. When pressed1 in- August last to abolish the&apos; duty by&apos;a deputation of mill-owners, we replied that we could not&apos; change our budget programme in the middle of the year when probable&quot; outturn of the year was still quite uncertain and&apos; the prospects of the following year&apos;s budget entirely unknown. Our attitude&apos;was the&apos; same when the Assembly moved-to suspend the duty in September. We told the&apos; Assembly that suspension was indistinguishable from abolition, and&apos; that abolition ought to be considered only in connection with the- finances of the year&apos;-as a&apos;whole, that is, at budget time, when-its-claims could be balanced against rival claims, and we warned the-Assembly tliatja vote for suspension would betaken as an expression of the view that the abolition of the cotton excise duty should&apos; take precedence of further relief to the&apos;&apos;provihces.   The&apos; Assembly voted-for -the&apos;- suspension- by a large majority.3. For&apos;the last.two months there lias been a complete stoppage of production in the-Bom bay mills owing to a strike and&apos;lock-out arising from a cut in wages. There are no&apos; signs of any immediate end of tile strike. Want of funds may bring the strikers back in&quot;December; but&apos; this&quot; is uncertain. We do not believe in the probability -of violent disorder, but; this is always a dangerous possibility. The strike on the whole has helped&apos;the inilhowners&quot;considerably by reducing their stocks, though not to tlie extent they had&apos;hoped&apos;, and has improved&apos;the financial position by reducing, bank ^advances against&apos; stocks. But&apos; the effect&apos; of the strike has been serious for the mill Hands and has intensified the general gloom in Bombay, practically all the business there being in a state of depression and unrelieved&apos;by, the hope of early improvement, in any direction.1. The reduction in wages may perhaps be justified on&apos;.the ground that-even so the real wages will be as high as in 1914, but it is probably true that reduction involves a lowering.of standard of life to which mill hands have been accustomed. A promise; given on behalf of mill-owners; that if cotton excise duty is abolished cut in wages, will be restored, complicates the situation and adds to feeling against Goveril-ment,, although&apos; many mill-owners resent promise and hold that both- reduction in wages and abolition of&quot; the duty are needed.5. Tho strength of feeling in Bombay against the Government of India-lias become a&apos; really unpleasant feature of- political situation in India generally. All -shades of opinion in Bombay-hold thatGovemment ought-to abolish the-duty at onoe. Our refusal to do so is-being almost&apos; universally attributed to a lack of sympathy and a de-liberate hostility to Bombay.- The Government of Bombay are in a difficult position, as there is nothing-that they can do to- relieve&apos; the-&apos; situation, and1 are themselves perhaps not free from the feeling that Indians policy is not in the best interest of Bombay.0. We had already, as a: Government, come to tentative conclusion some three months ago that, unless&apos; financial considerations rendered&apos;it impossible, tlie cotton excise duty-should be abolished in the budget for 1920-7. The fact that&apos;there are strong theoretical-arguments in justification of this form of taxation&apos; is beside the point,.in view of the political&apos;objections-tbcontiu uing it without implementing&apos; the pledge.given 101 years-ago.&apos; The maintenance of the duly hasiiow become&apos;a&apos;running sore in Ihdiam politics.-.7. &quot;We are still without detailed figures as ti probable outturn of budget estimates for 1925-0, and prospects for 1920-7, but we know much, more than we knew in. August. . We are convinced, on a general survey of the situation, ((i) that&apos;even&apos; if the collection of the cotton excise duty were suspended for the rest of the year there is no risk of any large deficit,.aad probability is than there will be a small surplus for
1925-6; and (fc) that,&apos;in absence of any big change for tlie worse in. the next lew Tiionths, the budget estimates for l&apos;92b-7 can be balanced1 without assistance- from the--cotton excise duty. -&apos;-&apos;&apos;&quot; : -&apos;&apos; -&apos;&apos;.-&apos;v y\:.-.&quot;;:&apos;.&apos;..81 AVe are therefore in a position to say to-day that financial considerations&apos; permit -of immediate abolition of the cotton&apos; excise- duty. i it would be preferable, on grounds of financial- regularity, to postpone action till&apos; the budget for 192&apos;6-7 is introduced, and to give the Assembly a further opportunity of realising the effect of tlie abolition upon such questions as the relief of the provinces. But if it&apos; be accepted&apos; that! the -cotton, excise duty is in any case to be abolished&apos; as from 1st March 1*926); there&apos; are strong arguments for not waiting till then.9i These&apos; arguments may be summed&apos;up as follows: -(a) The&apos; only practicable1 form of governmental assistance to&apos;- Bombay in.&apos;&apos;its difficulties is to get rid of the cotton&apos; excise duty. - ;   &apos; - -(ft) Action taken now will bring the strike of mill hands to an immediate end, will minimise the risk of violent disorder, and will be far more valuable than three-and-a-half months hence ; though abolition will not, either now or in March, solve the difficulties of the mill industry, ending of the strike as result of Government action will improve the -general position in Bombay material^&apos;.(c) Assembly may be regarded as having recommended the immediate abolitionof duty.(d) There is, at any rate, a risk that the surplus for 1925-6 may be substantial;in which case we shall be open to the accusation of deliberately ignoring the critical situation in Bombay, although funds were at our disposal.(e) In all circumstances refusal to do now what we are ready to do on 1st March,would seem, to amount almost to financial pedantry.10. We therefore recommend  for your approval   that cotton excise duty be suspended by issue of a special Ordinance from earliest date that can conveniently be ^arranged, say 1st December,, with declared intention of including in budget -for 1926-7 proposals for its abolition.II. So long as duty with its legacy of evil history remains, it is impossible to hope for effective action for improvement of cotton mills industry, whether by the imposition of additional duties on non-10mplr,e cotton goods by way of protection against Japan, or by means of an enquiry by Tariff Board or other agency, or for assistance of Indian consumer by means of a reduction of duty on imported cotton goods generally. The immediate abolition of duty will not hasten the moment when these questions can be fruitfully taken up. We do not, however, desire to attach any -conditions to our action at the present time. We shall simply be fulfilling our pledge to abolish duty as soon as financial considerations permit, and there are strong objections to making our action conditional. We recognise, however, that public opinion everywhere will not only insist on the mill-owners restoring cut in wages, but will also expect that a promise will be secured from the mill-owners in this matter! We are doubtful whether, in the long run, the mill-owners will gain from our action in abolishing duty, if it involves a complete restoration of the cut in wages, and we see grave objections to our making ourselves responsible for insisting on such restoration. But we are prepared, in the circumstances, to acquaint the Government of Bombay privately, if you agree to our proposals, of our intention to abolish the -duty, and inform them that, if they think fit, we have no objection to their attempting to arrange with the mill-owuers for some undertaking to restore wages to the level of August 1925, and to maintain them at that,level for at least a year from the date of: abolition of the duty.APPENDIX II.Draft telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Finance Department.^ our telegram of loth November. Cotton Excise. I have given the most careful consideration to your proposal, and, although reluctant to agree to the reduction of taxation except at budget time, I accept your recommendation that duty should be suspended by Ordinance from 1st December, proposals for its abolition being included in the budget of 1926-7. You have already come to the tentative conclusion that financial conditions will permit of the abolition of tlie duty with effect from 1st April next, and having regard to the exceptional circumstances created by the Bombay
strike; and to&apos;your belief that, even without the proceeds of the duty, there may be&apos; a small surplus in 1925-6, I agree that it would be desirable to anticipate this-decision. ,,- . , .    . ,.      r. .-&apos; His Maiesty&apos;s Government welcome the abolition, of the Gotton Jixcise as removing a long-standing political grievance bitterly resented by all shades of Indian opinion, and they trust also that it will serve to bring the Bombay strike to an end.I share your view that the abolition of the duty must be unconditional, as I. regard it in practice impossible to require, the mill-owners to restore the cut in wages for any definite period. 1 agree, however, that it would be well if the Governor of Bombay could arrange with mill-owners that they should restore the wages cut aud maintain waoes at the August level for at least a year. He may find it possible to impress upon them that, if, following abolition of the Excise, wages are again reduced, Government might find it difficult to resist a demand to initiate a statutory enquiry into the whole working of the cotton industry.
