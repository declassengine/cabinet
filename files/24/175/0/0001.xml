IRON AND STEEL.MR. DORMAN wrote:- &quot;I regret being unable to report any improvement since last month; in fact, conditions are rather more depressed,&quot;The production of pig iron in June amounted to 510,300 tons compared with 574,700 tons in May, and 607,800 tons in June 1924.   The furnaces in blast at the end of the month of June numbered 148, a decrease of 9 since the beginning of the month, and a decrease of 37 compared- with the number In blast at the end of June 1924.&quot;The production of steel was 585,400 tons in June as compared with 651,600 tons in May and 651,600 tons in June 1924.&quot;Further substantial reductions have been made in the prices of Continental Semi-finished material.   German Billets can be bought at about  5.0,9 per ton, and similar Belgian material at  5,1.0 per ton c.i.f. United Kingdom ports, which is a reduc-tion of about 4/- per ton below the prices quoted last month.&quot;The condition of the Black and Galvanised Sheet Trade is healthy, and ho difficulty is being experienced in dis-posing of outputs with the result that prices are firmer.&quot;Japan still continues to buy Black Sheets In quite substantial quantities.&quot;The Wire Trade is very lifeless, there being a great lack of orders, and such as there are, are only obtained in face of severe competition from the Continent.&quot;Steel Manufacturers In the Heavy Steel Trade generally find it increasingly difficult to carry on, and the outlook is far from promising.&quot;MR. BAKER said that nearly all the wage sliding scales in the industry registered reductions in wages for the next period. These reductions varied from li to 5 per cent. The heavy steel trade showed a reduction of 2-g/i.   That meant there had been continuous reductions from June of last year, or even prior to that, totalling to June last, 8-f- per cent,Mr, Baker did not know of any new works     having opened up or any new mills having started.   The number of furnaces in blast last June was 148,   as compared with 185 in June, 1924. In no district was more than half of the furnaces in blast. The wholesale prices index number for iron and steel goods was 126, as compared with the Board of Trade index figure of wholesale prices for all commodities, of 157.7.    Therefore, the trade,as a whole,was making an effort to get prices down to compete in the world&apos;s market.
4 4 11IRON AMD STEEL (Contd.)Unemployment throughout the whole trade, including pig iron, steel, tinplates, tubes and wire, was 22.3 per cent. In the heavy section of pig iron and steel, it was 24.0. Employment In the tin plate trade showed considerable improve-ment, unemployment being down to 19 per cent, as against 45 in February.   On the other hand, the United States seemed to be more successfully competing with us in our foreign markets now than they were.   It was a bright spot, Mr. Baker thought, that America should be doing better.     If some part of the world were doing better, we should probably get our chance. The prices of the United states Steel Company had improved slightly, and newspaper reports stated that their output was now equal to that In 1923.     This might be an Indication of an improvement In world trade for iron and steel.   If it did, he believed that we should get our share.SLaCTRIOAL TRADES.SIR HUGO HIRST wrote:- &quot;The last month&apos;s business has been entirely over-shadowed by the possibility of the dislocation of the Coal Mining Industry.   The uncertainty as to the outcome seriously affected all allied trades, and made itself felt in every Branch of our Industry.&quot;Some slight Improvement was noticeable in the Ship-building Trade which affected to some small degree our business with them, but the Steel Trade and Textile Trades are still very bad.&quot;While the Incoming Orders and our Returns on the Supply side have kept pace, or even slightly improved over the corresponding period of last year, the absence of enter-prise in the Industrial world has had a severely depressing effect on business in Heavy Machinery.&quot;Export business remains very quiet,  and we are severely handicapped by extremely low competitive prices, and the orders taken are at an extremely small margin of profit&quot;.TEXTILES:    COTTON.SIR W. CLARB LKjflS considered that in Manchester the position generally speaking, had been a stationary one for the last month.   The China position, so far as piece goods were concerned, was extraordinarily divided.     Some firms had been going full steam ahead, with orders to fulfil, and taking no notice at all of the disturbances and antl-British
j. 2TEXTILES; COTTON  (Cpntd .) .boycott.    Other firms had stopped trade with China altogether.    The big trade in the auctions also remained closed.General inquiries from most parts of the large buying markets had been, he thought, definitely more active during the last two or three weeks than they had been for some time past, and not very much of it appeared to have resulted, in business.   The industry were in need of renewal orders, and needed them now even more than before, because September and onwards was a critical time in the sense of needing renewals,COL, SEDDON BROWN said that in regard to the cotton spinning and \7eaving Industry, there was no doubt that although the American section of the spinning trade was only working approximately 39 hours per week, the pro-ductlon was still very much in excess of the off take.    In the Egyptian side, or the fine spinning section of the trade, it was found that they also were now suffering. No organised short time had been adopted in either section of the trade, but a good many firms had extended their summer holidays, and a good number of them had got spindles permanently stopped.    It might be said now that in the fine section as well as in the coarse, short time was resorted to, but not organised short time.    The same remarks applied, generally speaking, to the manufacturers of cloth.   There was also, no doubt, some export business in the trade which had gone much worse, both as regards cloth and as regards yarn; there were less orders getting on to the books for export than there had been a month ago.   As regards the home trade, Col. Seddon Brown had reported last month that the clearances of the retail establishments had been good as regards British cloth. The producers, however, were somewhat disappointed to find that no increase of inquiries for goods had yet reached them in consequence.The trade was just going through the very critical period of the  cotton growing crop in America, and they had the usual reports,every few weeks, of the crop being killed by drought and eaten by weavils.   He thought we should have to wait another few wee*ks, until perhaps the middle of September, and then buyers could form some judgment as to the likely course cotton prices would take, and It was hoped that there would be more trade.In answer to a question by the President, Col. Seddon Brown said he did not attribute the general shortage of orders to increased competition in particular markets, because the population of the world had increased since 1914, and one would naturally deduce the fact that more cloth would be wanted. The decreased demand was due to the lower purchasing power of the public throughout the world.
CONFIDENTIAL * TEXTILES: WOOL.MR. ANDREWS observed that the wool sales were resumed in Australia three weeks ago, and that the one point of satisfaction about that was that prices seemed to be stabilised on a fairly reasonable basis - about 70 per oent. of last year&apos;s prices.    An unfortunate thing  -was that the bulk of the competition was coming from abroad.    On account of the low oost of production in Prance they were able in that country to run all their machinery.   Mr. Andrews had asked one of his agents in France only last week what their greatest difficulty was, and he said &quot;Our greatest difficulty is getting labour&quot;.    Now that was exactly the opposite situation to our&apos;s.   We wanted to find employment for our people, and they were wanting people to employ.MR. SUTOLIFFE SMITH said that it was rather difficult to report the exact position to-day because there was only a negligible number of looms running.   That also applied to the spinning trade.   Before the strike there was no improvement in the spinning trade; according to the last week for which we had figures, July 22nd, there were 1,000 more totally unemployed, and about the same number partly unemployed, as compared with the previous week.    The further decline in cotton prices was temporarily holding up orders for goods where cotton was present.They were finding that the demand from markets like South America, Australia, and Egypt were keeping up fairly well, but the boycott in China was undoubtedly having a serious effect.The manufacturers had taken the step of Inviting the retailers to meet them for a discussion as to why orders were not being placed for British goods instead of foreign goods.    A frank expression of views was asked for, as to what was wrong with the British manufacturers production or distribution or styles, or in any other way, so that they could give what help they could in order to make their goods more saleable.    They learned a lot of very useful points,and at the same time removed many misgivings and misapprehensions held by the retail trade. There was the difficulty, however, that many Bradford merchants handled both foreign goods and British goods, and when they found that foreign goods were cheaper they bought foreign goods.    For instance, one merchant had  50,000 worth of French goods in his warehouse.   He sent travellers round, and they did not know whioh of the goods were British and which are foreign  gn, with the consequence that when patriotic retailers - and there were a great many - asked the commercial travellers whether their wares were British, they were unable to reply.   As was well known, however, the Bradford Dyers&apos; Association use their own mark very largely, and they would do It much more if merchants would let them.    Mr. Sutcliffe Smith added that he had particulars for 1904 to 1918 showing that in the whole of Yorkshire the spindles increased 20$ and the looms about 9fo during that period, but he oould not get the corresponding increase in the figures for Bradford alone because they were not taken out in 1904.    (The figures handed in are given in Appendix II at the end of these notes).MR. ANDREWS added that there had been a certain, inorease whioh would not be shown by the mere inorease in the number of spindles.    The reason was that larger spindles were being used to-day.    One oould not, however, accurately estimate their increase, because some spinners were still working with old, very small spindles for very fine goods, but for the coarser quality a larger spindle was being employed.
MR. PERRY wrote:- &quot;I do not find it necessary to make any material alterations or additions to my report last month,  though I am afraid I must add that the depression throughout the Chemical Industry, to which I then referred, has tended to increase rather than decrease during the last three weeks.POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS reported that the outlook was not very promising in the earthenware and china trade.    Naturally,. people would not purchase earthenware and china if they were not getting good earnings.     These were among the first things they would be likely to economize on.    The outlook was in fact dependent on the general trade situation, August was always a quiet month in the pottery trade, however,  owing to the holidays,   and they were hopeful that in September there would be a change for the better:   but for the moment there did not seem much comfort in prospect. Some of the Rome factories,  indeed, were doing well.    Others had to seek the export market in order to keep going.     The export trade in the high grade goods was very good.SHIPPING.SIR ALAR ANDERSON wrote:.- &quot;Tramp freights for June 1925 are less than 2% anobe those for 1913.   Laid-up tonnage at the principal ports of the United Kingdom was 777, GOO tons at July 1st, 1925, as against 470,000 tons at July 1st,   1924, while the grand total of ships laid up in Belgium, Denmark, Japan,  Holland and Prance was. according to the preliminary figures at present received, 420,000 tons.     No vessels are laid up in Germany or Finland.     On the 1st July, 1924, in Holland,  Japan and France about 511,000 tons were laid up against in 1925,337,000 tons,     So the extra expense of British ships is very clearly shown in the laid up figures.&quot;On June    30th,  1925, the tonnage under costruction in United Kingdom was less than on June 30th,  1924, by 420,000 tons,   and was 1,093,000 tons, whereas tonnage under construction abroad had risen by 176,000 tons to 1,276,000 tons.&quot;The chart comparing freights and time charter rates with wholesale prices and cost of living in this country shows that these four lines have run roughly parallel for the last four years,  but the wholesale prices here stay well above the freights which reflect world conditions and the cost of living prices here are well above the wholesale prices&quot;,RAILWAYS.MR. ^HURCOAiB, said that the railway position had not changed very much.    The receipts from passenger and merchandise traffic for the year to the 26th July,  that is, the first 30 weeks,  showed a decline of  1,400,000 and practically the whole of that was on merchandise.    The
RAILWAYS.    (Contd.).passenger receipts remained about the same as last year.   As regards the tonnage carried, the latest figures were those for May, and they showed very much the same tendency as those given at the Council&apos;s previous meeting, for April.     There was one working day less in the month of May 1925,  than in May 1924,   and this had to be borne in mind;    but the decrease as compared with May last year in the tonnage   hauled was about 380,000 tons in general merchandise, 2,286,000 tons in coal,  coke and fuel, and 580,000 tons in other minerals, making a total decrease of 3^ million tons, that is,  just under 11 per cent, for the total.     In the aggregate for the year up to the end of May, 1925, as compared with 1924,  the decrease in coal was 8% million tons, and in other minerals 1 million tons, in quite round figures.   Generally,  the rate of decrease in May as compared with May last year was rather higher than for the aggregate of the year, and there was a tendency for the marked decline in the very heavy traffics such as ooal, iron ore and pig iron,  to spread to the next heavier sort of traffics, including those in the building trade and stone for road making,SIR H.A, VvALKER wrote:- &quot;The position in regard to the outlook for&quot;trade so far as the Railway Companies are concerned has not materially changed since I put in my last statement, with the exception that just recently there have been some heavy forwardings of coal traffic, due no doubt to the anticipated trouble in the coal Trade&quot; ,BANKING AMD GENERAL TRADE.MR. TBNNANT handed in the reports from the different branches of the Westminster bank.   They showed very much the same results as for the month of June,    Manchester was perhaps somewhat better, but on the whole the reports were almost exactly the same.With regard to the money market during this month,  the month began with the discount rates quite firm at something like 4^ or a little over, and during the month these rates had slipped away and were not now more than 4 4/16 or 4 5/16. This was thought to have been caused by the influx of gold during the month, which had amounted on balance to the considerable sum of approximately  5,300,000.     The American Exchange had rather fallen.With regard to the loans that were being brought out, the only two gilt-edged loans had been the Australian loan and that for the Union of South Africa.     In both cases they were quite successful and the Underwriters were entirely relieved of stock.MR. PEASE said that the chief things which had been interesting the money market had been the rates and the position of gold as relating to the rates, as Mr. Tennant had just said. That had been considerably easier,  and one heard very much less talk of the possibility of an increase in the Bank rate, -it was rather perhaps even the reverse.     The two factors which bore on these points during the Autumn were the seasonal demands
BAHKIMG AND GENERAL TRADE (Contd.)from America on the one hand, and on the other hand the reoent Australian Loan - which was subscribed to the extent of -i  15, 000, 000 in America, * was wanted on this side,  and was equivalent practically to a gold shipment to this country from America.   How far those two conflicting factors would balance each other remained to be seen, but Mr. pease did not think that tighter times in the money market were anticipated at present.He observed that there had recently been a renewal of the very controversial argtxments in regard to the gold standard. The Bank World and the Financial World had always recognised that the return to the gold standard and the Improvement in the value of the pound sterling would have some effect,  in the initial stages, on the facilities for export, but they never contemplated that the state of this country would be better by the valuation of the pound being less, and there did not seem to be any reason to alter that view.The PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRAD a remarked that the public of ten assumed&apos; that&apos; the banks&quot;&apos; &apos; view was hostile to,  or at least separate from,  the indvistrial view.     But, in the case of the Joint Stock Banks, the consideration which weighed more than any other was, how any given state of things was going to affect Industry, for it was industry which was the banks&apos; chief customer.     He thought it might not be a bad thing if bankers were to make that clear.MR. PEASE thought the fallacy had perhaps arisen out of the fact that people said that one of the chief parts of the bankers1 business was to lend money, and that,  thereforet a period of deflation suited their book;    they lent money when money was a certain price and were repaid at a time when the value of the pound was higher, and therefore scored.   That was entirely wrong.     As a matter of fact,  although Bankers did lend money as a very considerable part of their business, they were borrowers to the extent of two to one through their deposits, and therefore, if they were actuated only by personal selfish considerations,   they would be in favour of a period of inflation and a decreasing value of the pound,Mr. Pease agreed with Mr, Tennant that Trade reports did not show much change.     There was a little Improvement In Manchester;   boots and shoes had been doing well;   but, generally,  the position had not altered much in the last month.COL. WILLEY remarked that the Federation of British Industries had always been orthodox in their views, which co-incided with the belief that we wanted our currency to return as soon as possible to its proper standard.     The Federation went to the Chancellor of the Exchequer early in this year to urge him to take a decision then, as regards the renewal or the termination of the existing Act, so that industry might have time to adjust itself to the conditions which would result from the decision taken.     Prudent traders, as soon as it seemed probahle that the Government would take the decision of not renewing the Act, prepared for bad times, and events had since justified them.     There had been a substantial deflation - if the term could be used - of commodity prices.
CONFIDENTIAL. BANKING AND GENERAL TRADE (Cpntd.),It was expected that this would be accompanied by a reduction of the cost of services.   There was a strong Bank Rate, and the Governors of the Bank prevented the raising of foreign loans.    The impression existed among Industrialists that the policy of the Bank would be found to be complementary to that of the Government, and*that they would have to go through the bad times of this adjustment period whilst commodity prices came down.    But there was a distinct hesitation on the part of the trades concerned to submit to the reduction of wages which was the inevitable result of a reduction of the cost of services generally.    It was expected that the first reduc-tions would be in transport and coal, and all the other trades naturally asked why, until that reduction had been suffered by those trades, should they submit to a reduction? It had seemed that a monetary policy which Inevitably necessitated the forcing down of commodity prices and services, was being contemplated by the Government, encouraged by the Governors of the Bank of England, and prepared for by the tradesj when suddenly, while the Government with one hand were imposing that policy, with the other they arrested it by an artificial impediment, first in their tardiness in restoring the Minister of Labour&apos;s discretion to withhold uncovenanted unemployment pay, which naturally arrested the downward trend of the cost of services, and now (no doubt for good reason and in the full possession of the facts) by a subsidy on coal, which was going again to arrest the natural reduction of prices which would follow services being reduced. The natural result of this deflation policy would have been that, while industrialists would suffer from the reduction on their prices of stocks and profits on turn-over, the workers would also In the intervening period suffer the disadvantage of a reduction in wages - in money wages - before real wages could have come down, because there would be a lag between the two*    Industrialists were puzzled at the Government^ action, and it was hoped that there would be some expression of the intentions of the Government, or some lead given to Industry as a whole, as to which course is going to be the more definitely pursued.Referring to the *7ool Textile trade In particular,  in which there was a dispute at present, one found there an instance of a trade which apparently   believed that they ought to conform to the general policy of reduction of costs.    They had been discussing a renewal of a wage agree-ment, and it was suggested that they should conform to the general policy of the Government and facilitate some defla-tion in their costs.   This had resulted in a refusal on the part of the workers to accept such a proposition, and therefore there was a strike.   There seemed, accordingly, a need of a clear lead from the Government as to what line they wished to be taken.CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY,SIR THOMAS ALLEN considered that on the whole, purchasing power seemed to be weaker.   Woollens, furnishing, and boots showed an Increase on the quarter of 6 per cent,and on the year of 7 per cent.    In respect of essential foodstuffs,
CONFIDENTIAL. CO-OPERATIVE -WHOLESALE SOCIETY (Oontd.).there was a decrease on the quarter of 2 per cent., but an increase on the year of about 8 per cent, but this increase was counteracted altogether when prices were taken into consideration,    prices still were very substantially above what they were twelve months ago, in essential foodstuffs. The inoreases ranged from 4 to 27 per oent.    They were   ., hoping, as wheat was about 25 per cent, dearer than it was twelve months ago, that with the prospects of a good harvest-- &quot; in Canada and in Russia, the position might be somewhat relieved, and consequently would bring down the general average price of foodstuffs.SCOTTISH 00-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY.MR. GALLAGHER said that the settlement of the coal orisis has given them considerable satisfaction in Scotland. Tt would relieve the tension considerably, evenif it was only a settlement for 9 months.    It had been very seriously affecting the Sooiety&apos;s trade, but they were beginning to move even within the last few days, much better.    In the last four weeks of the present half-year they showed an increase of about 5 per cent, but it was practically all on groceries.    The total increase amounted to almost  60,000, and nearly  56,000 of that was in the Grocery Department. The drapery showed a slight   decrease of  46.    Boots and shoes show an increase of  500, and furniture an increase of  1,200.   At the last meeting of the Council Mr. Gallagher was asked if he could give any information with regard to the question of an increased standard of living.    A suggestion had been made that people were spending more on necessities,, food, clothing, boots and so on, than they were before the War, notwithstanding the increased cost of commodities, - living, in fact, almost beyond their income. Mr. Gallagher had taken out certain figures relevant to that matter which he   -would like to submit, and which threw a certain amount of light upon the subject.    He had taken them out with regard to four Departments, - drapery, &quot;grocery, furniture and boots.(These figures are given in Appendix I at the end of the present notes).MR. GALLAGHER added that the figures in the tables as to money values were, of course, wholesale figures, and that one would have to add about SO per cent, to get the actual retail value of the goods.    Of course, also, the figures were approximate.    It might be that, beoause of bad times, the members of the retail   co-operative societies   were to some extent going elsewhere, to the cheaper priced shops, for some of their goods, but on the whole, the tables were probably a pretty fair index to the position, and went to prove that working people had not increased their standard of living at all, and that, if anything, there was a deorease in the standard of living as compared with 1913.MRo BAKER remarked that wages in the steel trade, the heavy section, were 137-g- per oent. as compared with lllj in 1913, showing an inorease of 23 per oent. only, but the cost of living   had inoreased 73 per oent.    The better-paid men in the steel trade were not getting the money to buy more than in 1913.    The lower-paid men were in sue1! a hard case that the employers raised their wages last year believing that the men could not live on the wages they were getting.    There, also,  the men could not be purchasing more.-9-
AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON said that this was the quiet season of the year; but, although somewhat patchy, it was on the whole good, so far as the prospects for wool and meat particularly are concerned.    There had been a good deal of discussion In Australia in regard to the wool stabilisation scheme, which for the moment was meeting with a very mixed reception, and there was a great deal of opposition to it.    Owing to the rise in price which took place when the wool sales re-opened In Australia, there had been a tendency to realise the wool and to leave further action in regard to the stabilisation scheme in abeyance.    The exports of beef up to the 30th June last were 1,365,000 quarters against 1,359,000 for the whole of 1924, so that recent opinion was rather that next year would show a considerable reduction, as stocks had been very largely absorbed.The butter market was firm; and, after the 1st of this month, the export of butter and cheese from the Commonwealth to destinations other than the east were prohibited unless the exporter received a licence which would be issued for twelve months, subject to certain conditions, one of which was that the exporter, within seven days of shipment was to furnish full particulars of the shipment to the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Control Board in Melbourne, and also that the London Agency of the Control Board was to be notified of the price received within seven days of the Sale,   That was in accordance with the law that had been passed establishing the control.   There were other conditions and restrictions which might be imposed regulating supplies, and so on.   The    j dried fruit trade showed that up to 31st July, there had been sold about 2,850 tons, realising  186,,500, and sub-stantial realisations were anticipated within the next four   I or five weeks.   The apple exports for the 1925 season had amounted to 2,117,000 cases, at prices ranging from 10/6d. to 32/- per case.TRADE WITH CHINA.MR LANDALE observed that all business  with China was still very much&apos; interfered with by the Anti-British boycott, and that it was extremely difficult to sell any goods of        f British manufacture.   He thought it was to be regretted that I the Judicial Enquiry into the Shanghai incident of the 30th   j I/iay had not yet been held.    The delay had stimulated the boycott, which was causing enormous losses to British tradersjHe ventured to submit that at this critical juncture thel British Legation in Peking should not have been left so long in charge of a Charge dfAffaires without any previous ex-perience of China.    It was of the most vital importance to British interests that the country should be represented at the forthcoming Conference by a man of outstanding personall and,  if possible,one with experience of dealing with Oriental questions.    It was impossible for H.Mi Minister, or anyone else, to undertake the dual task of conducting the
TRADE WITH CHINA (control,).daily business of the Legation in a crisis of this character, and also adequately to represent Great Britain and lead (as he undoubtedly must) an International Conference of so complicated a nature.Latest reports showed there had been a distinct advance towards resumption of normal working on most of the Railways in China,    They had not been much affected by the general strike and anti-British boycott, except by the stagnation of trade at the Treaty Ports which had resulted. The Tientsin-Pukow Railway had an earning power as high as any in the world, but being unfortunately under Chinese control, which meant to-day under military despoliation, its revenues were confiscated and its rolling stock commandeered without payment.    If this railway could be put on the same terms of administration and control as the Peking-Mukden Railway,  there would soon be surplus earnings available as security for the finance of other Railways requiring assistance, such as the Canton-Kowloon Railway, which was on the verge of closing down for want of working capital.UNEMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS (Ministry of Labour) sent the following statement:-On the 27th July the figure of the Unemployed Register was 1,197,600 or 106,600 lower than on 29th june there were in fact decreases shown in each of the last 4 weeks.   During the same period last year there was an inorease in the register of 38,800,   No very definite reason can be assigned for the drop of 106,600 but it is possible that it was due to a speeding up of work, of all kinds In apprehension of a stoppage in the coal mining industry.As compared with a year ago, the unemployed register on 27th July this year was 149,3 00 higher than on 28th July, 1924.As between the end of June,  1924, and the end of June, 1925, on the basis of unemployment books lodged, there was an increase of 297,000 or from 9.3 to 11,9 per cent.    The percentage unemployment among females increased from 7.7 to 8.3 and among males from 9.8 to 13.2.The increase in coalmining was 255,000, in steel smelting &amp;c, 11,000, in shipbuilding and ship repairing 12,000, in woollen and worsted 35,000, aid in canal^river^ dock and harbour service 10,700; the noticeable decreases&apos; were in engineering (iron and steel founding) 17,400, In cotton 38,500, and in building 5,300.

Statement regarding the export trade position made at the meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Overseas Trade on Wednesday, 32nd July, 1925.COTTCIi.     Mr, Lee (cotton yarns) said that he, could not paint a rosy picture of the textile trade, &apos;  The American Section was if till working short time, being engaged for 39^- hours weekly and arrangements had been&quot;Y;iade in August for the trade to stop for an extra week.     The fine trade was in a quiet state and 15,to 16 per cent, of the machinery.&apos; was standing idle.     He pointed but that epot cotton was 6d. dearer than the new crop price.     The real difficulty, however, was that they,could not sell their yam at a profit.      In the fine trade they had not had the same amount of short time as the other sections and were costing on a full production basis.     Another of the difficulties was that the price of their products teas up 100 per cent, while the purchasing capacity of their customers had net increased more than 50 per cent.Mr. Boothman (Labour) was interested to hear Mr. Lee &apos;s remarks about selling at a lossj since this was not, he understood,  the practice In the American Section of the trade, where. - the policy was to restrict production and raise prices to an extent capable of giving&apos; a&apos; fair return.     The prospects of trade ware rather worse now than they had been.Mr. Holroyd (cotton spinning&apos;) said that according to his information our manufacturers were losing some of the Indian trade.      The Industry here was suffering from high costs of production and it seemed to be a difficult matter to effect any reduction.     French, German and Italian makers were now in a position to manufacture mere cheaply and were gaining our markets,     lie had just returned from a tour on the continent and found that in Belgium, while they were still working a, 48 hours weeki in some of the works two shifts a day were being worked, thereby reducing cost.     He did not agree with the view which had been expressed in certain quarters that production-tion should be reduced so as to ensure a profit on actual output.     He thought that no attention should be paid to such propaganda which was most detrimental.     He pointed out that many of the comparisons which had been .made as to numbers of spindles were most misleading.     In Japan, for instance, there were 3f million spindles and on enquiry from a Japanese agent here he was told that the Industry was now -working 21 hours daily.     The result was that these 3-g- million spindles were really equivalent to about 10 million.IftQI-: AHD STB3L.Sir William Larke (pig-iron, steel, castings, etc), was unhappily not in a position to offer a good report in relation to the iron and steel industry.     He -referred to the steady decline In export trade-, the exports of iron and steel materials having fallen to a monthly average of 300,000 tons as  .    jjl compared with 400,000 tons In 1912/1913 or only 75 per cent, of the pre-war volume..     With regard to imports the imports of manufactured products were up &quot;40 per cent, as against those in 1912/1913.   He felt that until the costs of the industry were   -appreciably lower there was little hope of their being able tomeet/
met successfully the severe competition from continental suppliers.      In this connection he pointed out that what should be looked at was not only the. rate of exchange but also the cost of living index figure.      For example,&apos; In France francs externally were worth only 103 to the pound, while their internal purchasing power was more nearly 55 to the pound.     He pointed out that the British iron and steel industry had cut their costs down to 28 per cent, of the pre-war figures and gave the following comparison of wap.es paid here and cn the continentUnited Kingdom 63/- per week of 48 hours.Germany 33/6d.Belgium 32/-France 30/-At the present time production in this country only reached 70 per cent, of the capacity in steel and less in pig-iron. If they could increase their production by 25 per cent, it would mean that they would be able to reduce their costs by something like 20 per centiMr. Samuel asked whether Sir William Larke had any evidence as to the effect on the non-sheltered trades of the wages paid in the sheltered industries, such as the railways.     Sir William Larke stated that If railway rates could be  brought down to pre-war level, ?/hich he did not expect was possible,  it would mean a reduction of 6 per cent, in their costs.      He pointed out that apart from this the heavy burden of local taxation and social services, amounting to 8/- or 9/- a ton. had to be borne,     Mr. Samuel stated that the figure of  120,000,000 had been given to him as the &quot;burden on the non-sheltered trades of this country and asked if it were possible for Sir William Larke, through his ovganisation,  to give a considered estimate,      Mr. Johnston pointed out that the reduction of wages would affect the purchasing power of the home market very seriously.     Mr. Baker: agreed that local taxation was much too high aid Instanced Sheffield, where three years ago the rates were 22/5.1* in the pound.     By careful organisation they had got some business men elected to the City Council with &quot;fee result that they had been successful in getting the rates reduced by 30 per cent.      Sir William Larke did not think that sufficient attention had been paid to the difference between apparent and real wages.      The only justification for high wages was low costs with Increased production.HARDWARE &amp; MBTAL TRADES.Mr, Vyle reported that there was a feeling of anxiety in Bix^iingham that the present conditions were likely to become permanent.     No one appeared to be able to find a way out and the situation was mainly due to inability to produce goods at a price at which an export trade could be obtained,Mr, Samuel pointed out that the motor trade in Australia was very largely in American hands, to which Mr. Vyle replied that this was  due chiefly to the system of taxation adopted In this country - the rate here being  1 per II.P. as against 17 cents in the States.      The result was that British jnakers had to produce a highly efficient engine whereas the l3.rs.-e American engine, with its loosefitting/
fitting parts, oould be produced more cheaply and had proved to be more suitable, having regard to the bad roads in Australia for use in the Commonwealth.     He pointed out, however, that roads in America and all over the acrid were improving, and that possibly in time there would be a change to the British type of design.     )Avf Samuel said that ho had heard this argument advanced before against the motor taxes and he was sure the Government would be willing to consider any alternative mthod put forward.INDIA.-      Mri Lindsay stated that the June report had Just arrived from India.     Exports were well maintained while imports were falling off.     lie was in a position, however, to state that the reduction of Imports from the United Kingdom was purely a question ox price and as far as he was aware there was no suggestion of holding off on political grounds.     As regards cotton piece goods imports wars slightly better.     The brunt of the depression in India was being borne by the Bombay mills which were piling up stocks.     Curiously enough this depression did not extend to Cawnporo and Nagpur, where, apparently, the long railway journey afforded some measure of protection.     In regard to the general situation Mr, Lindsay said that the price level had not undergone any change and still reinained at about 170 as compared with approximately 160 for other countries. In spite of that the rupee remained fairly constant at 12 to 13 per cant, over pre-war value,     In view of this fact there was some demand for returning to the pre-war rate of l/4d.     The monsoon was understood to &quot;oe progressing satisfactorily.CHINA^      i,ir. Dodwell (China merchants trade) was pessimistic regarding the situation in China.      In Hong Kong things were at a complete standstill and the position in Shanghai was not tax oh better though It was curious that during the month of June their deliveries, at a time when they expected hardly to transact any business, amount to one-third of the normal.     There was one point on which ho asked specially for information namely, -/hether the Depart/asnt had any news as to a general boycott of British goods by the Shanghai Chamber of Comae res-, which ha had seen In the press would come into force on the 1st August for a period of one year. Sir William Clark stated that the Department had no information as to the alleged boycott.     He read a telegram from the Commercial Secretary at Shanghai giving a report on the situation which confirmed ;.ir. Dodwell*a-gloomy statement. Mr. Charter stated that he had seen an even more definite state.aent In the press (22 July) as to the boycott.
