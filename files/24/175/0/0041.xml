Memorandum by the Minister of Health.Copy No.  \j0At the request of the Home Secretary I circulate a draft letter to local authorities describing the emergency organisation.   The question is whether such a circular should be issued forthwith or held over until after the local elections.    There has not been time to bring the matter before the Cabinet Committee and in view of the imminence of the elections the deoision of the Cabinet Is sought as a matter of urgency.(Intd.)   N.C.Ministry of Health.22nd October, 1925.
fom council aBeiropoTftaiT Borou&amp;h Counolla CIRCDLAR 636, u^an^Distriet councilIfiH^aTlStglrlot&quot;ITounclie (England and Wales),Ministry of Health, Whitehall, S..W.1.October, 192S.Sir,I AM directed by the Minister of Health to refer to the Circular Letter which was sent to local authorities in May 1922 (see appendix) in which it was stated that it would be for local authorities to make such arrangements for the maintenance of local services aa might be thought to be required in the event of need arising.The owente of recent years have shown that an industrial dispute may be so extended aa to interfere seriously with communications, the conveyance of food and of other necessities, the supply of light and power and the health and means of livelihood of the population at large.   The remedies for the dangers and inconveniences of such a situation can best be supplied by decentralised organisation designed to secure tho maintenance of services essential to the well-being of the community.Should such an emergency occur it is to their local authorities that the people will naturally turn for help in the difficulties which they may have to meet, and in order that any action initiated locally may harmonise with the national measures which the Government consider it desirable to take they think it necessary now to communicate to local authorities the following outline of the organisation which would be brought into operation by the Government to deal with essential services which are not purely local in character.     This outline will, if it-be   . necessary, be supplemented by further details in a later communication.   By &quot;emergency&quot; is meant a state of affairs necessitating the issue of a Proclamation under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, as a preliminary to the iesue of Regulations &quot;for securing the essentials of life to the country.11The organisation which the Government propose is designed to supplement and to assist in an emergency the normal methods of communication, supply and distribution and to give to all those who can help an opportunity of doing so in the manner most required.    It is not intended that the Government should substitute new machinery for that ordinarily existing to meet the essential needs of the community.1. A Minister will in such an emergency aot aa Civil Commissioner on behalf of the Government in each of ten Divisions covering the vfhole of England and Wales.   He will be assisted, by a staff consisting mainly of representatives of the Departments of Government concerned and dealing with the following subjects: Transport;   Foodj   Postal Servicee;   Coal.    It will be the duty of the Civil Commissioner and his staff during tho emergency to keep in touch with the Local Authorities in each Division and toteavailable/
^ HI K L 0 Javailable for consultation by them;    and he will be empowered if necessary to give decisions on behalf of the Government.The Officers who will act as the Chief Assistants to the Civil Commissioners and those who will act as Technical Representatives for the services mentioned have been appointed, and those Officers will, when the need arisesi put themselves in touch with representatives of Local Authorities, and provide them with such information as may be practicable in regard to details of the organisation.2. Each Division is divided into suitable areas for administering essential national services and for recruiting volunteers for those purposes.     In each area there will be a local Food Officer, a local Road Officer and a Haulage Committee, and a coal emergency Officer, besides representatives (where required) for other essential services.   A Chairman has-been selected by the Government to convene and preside over a ; Volunteer Service Committee in each area for the recruitment of volunteers to assist in maintaining essential national services.i .In any town in which the Chairman of the Committee considered it necessary to open a recruiting centre, It Is earnestly hoped that it would be found practicable for the Local Authority concerned to combine with him in making the centre available for recruiting both for national and for local purposes, allocating by arrangement volunteers to local and national services in accordance with their qualifications and the needs of the occasion.     Local Authorities are not expected to take any action so far as national services are concerned, unless and until approached by the Chairman.3. On an emergency arising reliance will be plaoed to tho utmost extent upon normal channels for the supply and distribution of food, and to this end the Divisional Food Representative upon the Civil Commissioner^ staff will arrange for consultation with the principal traders aa to the stocks of essential food-stuffs In their possession or in transit.     In the event of any shortage or delay in the supply of essential food-stuffs to the Division, the Food Representative will be In possession of information as to alternative sources of supply and the means to make them available.Local distribution and local shortages not affooting national supplies will ordinarily be dealt with by the local Food Officer.4. Road Transport will bo dealt with on similar lines. The Road Commissioner upon the Civil Commissioner^ staff will be assisted by Road Officers and Haulage Committees in each of the areas comprised in the Division, who will endeavour by voluntary arrangement to promote the economical use of existing vehicles and where necessary the diversion of vehicles from loss to more important services.   Road Commissioners and Road Officers will be furnished with powers to this end should the exercise of such powers prove necessary.5. Should the need arise full directions will be sent as to the supply and distribution of coal.     These directions may, if necessary, limit the supply of coal obtainable for any household or business, and jray also place upon Local Authorities responsibilities for regalst-ing the consumption of gas and electricity within their di,strices.    They would pr bably necessitate in most cases the allocation of a particular officer or officers by the Local Authority during the period that they were in force.The/
0. ifThe Local Authority will have the assistance of 6 Coal Emergency Officer and of a Committee of Traders within their own district.6. The maintenance of law and order and the protection? of persons and property from violence may be one of the most important services.   The organisation of the necessary arrangements and the control of the Police and Special Constabulary rest with the Police Authorities and the Chief Constables * but the Local Authorities might co-operate, for instance, in securing able-bodied citizens of good character to serVe as Special Constables.   The arrangements for the enrolment of Special Constables will be madevby the Police * and any men who come forward as Special Constables, or who offer their services In a general capacity and appear most suited for aervioe as Special constables should be referred td the Police Station or other place of enrolment appointed for the purpose *i?. While it is impossible to draw any hard and fast line of demarcation between national and local services which la universally applicable the position may be broadly defined as followst   Local Authorities are expeotod to undertake responsibility for the maintenance of local public utility services;   in addition they arc asked to co-operate with the national organisation in regard to local transport and the local distribution of coal.     In the absence of further directions they arc not expected to undertake responsibility for the local distribution of food nor are ihey caked to accept responsibility for shipping, railway or postal communications, or dock8 and harbours except where the Local Authority arc also the Port Authority.8. In an emergency the burden upon national resources must in any event be considerable and no responsibility could be accepted by the Government for expenditure incurred by Local Authorities in meeting local needs. Precise instructions will be issued to Chairmen of Volunteer Service Committees for the allocation of expenditure where a joint recruiting station is established, and will be communicated to Local Authorities by them.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,W.A.  ROBINSON.The Clerk to the Local Authority
