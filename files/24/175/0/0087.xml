He is, moreover, con-; vinced that if the Nation is to be able to finance new projects, designed to provide additional facilities for Higher Education; and to improve the instruction of the older children in Elementary Schools, it is essential that a clear understanding should be reached as to the amount of expenditure which public, funds will be called upon to bear for the administration and maintenance of existing services. ,:: ,.     , ,The Board have attempted to review the factors governing the.&apos; recent growth in local expenditure-on education, and;&apos;the possibility of economies. It is observed that the expenditure of Authorities in 1924-25 shows a total increase, as compared with 1923-24, of about  1,400,000, and that only a,relatively small: part of this appears to be attributable to the. provision of new facilities. The increase of expenditure on Administration,,.both1 Elementary and Higher, and on &quot; other &quot; expenses of Elementary Education, is alone responsible for, no&apos;less, than  740,000 of this increase. ; It would appear that this; expenditure; on existing services offers a field for economies,- and this, field-is extended by the reduction in. the cost.of salaries.resulting from the Burnham Award. To these factors must&apos; be added&apos; the prospect of economies resulting, from reorganisation of, schools, the gradual fall in loan charges,...and the further administiratiye economies which may- be&apos;expected ;to result-from a simplification of. the relations between the Board and Local Authorities.&apos;.&apos;&apos; -&apos;&apos;&apos;
Having regard to these facts and to the decision reached by H.M. Government that, in the existing state of the national finances, it is necessary to place a limit upon the demands to be made upon the Exchequer in the year 1926-27, the Board have decided that they can reasonably, and without detriment to the development of essential educational services, limit their grant to Local Education Authorities as indicated below and ask Local Authorities, in this national emergency, to make corresponding economies. This limitation will still leave the Board&apos;s Estimates at a substantially higher figure than in the present year.While the grants which can be provided on this basis appear to the Board to be reasonable and to leave scope for the development of essential services, the Board cannot contemplate a return to the system of restrictions and controls associated with Circular 1190. They are- themselves undertaking administrative . economies involving the immediate reduction of the estimates for the Board&apos;s own administration to the 1923-24 level, and they believe that any attempt to impose detailed restrictions on expen-diture would not only be incompatible with the spirit of the times, but would also entail a further complication of administration, instead of the simplification they desire to see. They therefore propose to adopt a policy of block grants and to ask Parliament to pass the necessary legislation for this purpose.^-jru^- &apos; ^ In accordance with these congKlerations a block grant will be // ft&apos;zJLtu3iU l^xe(l ^or each Authority on the basis^ The grant so fixed will be /r!/&apos;/ I guaranteed to each Authority as a minimum for not less than &apos; three years from 1st April, 1926, and will be paid in full, subject only to such conditions of grant as are indicated in the penul-legitimate paragraph of this Circular. The benefit of any economies made by the Authority will thus accrue to it in full. The grants will, of course, be adjusted in the year 1928-29 and subsequent years to carry out the provisions of section 9 of the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1925.While the occasion for the introduction of this system is the present financial situation, the Board are convinced that a change in the grant system is essential if Local Authorities are to be enabled to exercise their own judgment in the developi-irient of education, if that development is to be steady and con-tinuous, and if administration is to be put on an efficient and economic basis. They had hoped to introduce a. change of system gradually through the programme procedure, and they believe that this&apos;procedure may still be used to assist the change, but circum-stances have compelled them to accelerate their decision, and the alteration in the grant system must of course affect the basis upon which Authorities have been considering their programmes.Tt is obvious that this change necessitates a corresponding change in the system of Regulations, etc., under which the Board&apos;s relations with Authorities have hitherto been carried on, and the Board have in fact been engaged for some months past in
a reconsideration of the Code, -Building and other Regulations. They would desire that in future their Regulations should he confined to those minimum requirements which may. properly be prescribed as actual conditions of grant.:, that outside, these actual conditions of grant the Board&apos;s action should generally take the form of advice given for the consideration of Authorities : and that such advice should be directed rather to the maintenance and improvement of the general standard of eduoation than to an. investigation into the details of educational administration.The Board recognise that changes of this far-reaching character must form the subject of consultation and discussion with Authorities, and they will welcome the advice of Authorities on the contents of this Circular, and in particular on any point where an alteration in the existing requirements of the Board would, in their opinion, assist administrative economies.APPENDIX. Basis of Grants.(1) A sum equal to the grant payable for 1924-25 on Elementary Education, less one per- cent. This sum will be sufficient to provide in general for the payment of grant at the usual percentage on the salaries payable under the Burnkam Award for the number of teachers employed on the 31st March, 1935, and the Board will make special provision to meet tlie case of areas where the adoption of the Burnham Scales since that date entails an increase in the cost of salaries.(2) A sum equal to the grant payable for 1924-25 on Higher Education, after deduction of any sum paid in that year in respect of expenditure on non-Local Education Authority Schools, since disallowed for grant on tlie score of duplication due in respect of the super-grant on free places, since discontinued. This assumes an expenditure by Authorities of about  600,000 in excess of expenditure in 1923-24,less(a) 30s. for each ckild on the register on 31st March, 1925, under the age of five years;(h) a sum apportioned to each Authority for higher education in respect of the super-grant to Local Education Authority Training Colleges;(c) a sum similarly apportioned in respect of half the cost of aid now being given b3&apos; the Board to day students at Training Colleges and University Training Departments and to students in training for the teaching profession at Universities. Note. The deduction under (6) carries out the recommendation made by the Departmental Committee on the Training of Teachers.   The block grants to local education authorities maintaining training colleges will be reduced by tke amount of tke existing grant in respect of tkose colleges and a separate block grant will be made to tkem as recommended by the Departmental Committee.The deduction under (c) is proposed on tke ground that direct grants in aid of individual students (apart from State sckolarships) should properly be a matter for local administration. The Board will be glad to discuss with Authorities the manner in which such grants should be administered in future.
.^Thevsums&apos;dealt; with under these, two; headings will amount to about  193,000. It is. proposed to apportion this sum among. Authorities for higher education oh a &apos;basis which will&apos;take account of&quot; the elementary school population&apos;and the rateable value of the whole area: on which the ratfe for higher education is levied.&apos;&apos;The deduction linder(o) is proposed on the-ground-that national funds are at present; bearing. ah undue proportion of the expenditure involved in the full-time attendance at school of very young children. The Board are not, indeed, to be understood as pronouncing a general opinion in regard to .the adinissw^ of drHdreh under, the age of compulsory school Ifftehdance, -a question which musgSdo-good- largely on local social con-ditions. It is a matter for consideration, however, whether the practice of part-time attendance,of children up to the age of about six might not be extended, in which case&apos; considerable savings - might be effected.(55288)  Wt.

B1.      The Committee had before them a ITote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (IT.E.12) covering a memorandum prepared by the Treasury on the provision for unemployment relief in 1926.With regard to the grants administered by the Unemployment Grants Committee&apos;, the Chancellor of the Exchequer drew the attention of the Committee to his proposals,which were that an immediate embargo should be placed on all new schemes coming before Lord St.Davids&apos;  Committee but that all commitments entered into by that  Committee to date should be duly honoured.      So far as schemes on the loan basis are concerned, an immediate embargo would give no saving on the 1926-27 Estimates, but would give very substantial economies in the Estimates for 1927-28 and 1928-29.vvdth regard to schemes on the wages basis an immediate embargo would give a saving of  300,000 on the 192^-27 Estimates and Substantially larger savings on the Estimates of the two following years.After reminding the Go;uiiittee of the origin and development of this particular service the CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed out that however necessary it may have been to assist Local Authorities immediately after the war to undertake works of real acceleration with a view to meeting what was then regarded as a purely temporary unemployment crisis, the justification for the policy had disappeared, when all accelerated work had been carried out and unemployment had become almost chronic.      In the view of the Treasury, unemployment  is more effectively assisted by National economy than by national expenditureEL is.a) Grants administered by theUnemployment Grant s Commit tee.
ahd, having regard to the somewhat  improved outlook., the time for an alteration of policy seemed very propitious .THE LIIEISTER OE TRANSPORT informed the Committee that he agreed generally with the proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer so far as concerned services with which his Department was interested, namely, roads, tramways, light railways, electricity and harbours.        As regards electricity it would be much better to expend any money available on some major Government scheme than to dissipate it on assisting minor schemes.      There might be some small justification for giving continued help   to certain harbour authorities by Lord St.Davids&apos;  Committee but on the whole he did not think that an exception should be made in the case of those particular undertakings.THE MINISTER OE LABOUR reminded the. Committee that the proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer involved a very large political question and would give rise to very considerable criticism.      Speaking generally he was in favour of cutting down unemployment relief schemes in those places where trade was good but he felt    very great difficulty in refusing to assist schemes in the very distressed areas and thought that in any case arrangements must be made to meet exceptional cases.      Such cases could, he suggested best be dealt with by    retaining in being Lord St. Davids&apos;  Committee.THE CHANCELLOR OE THE EXCHEQUER expressed the view that the work of Lord St.Davids&apos;   Committee should be determined and that exceptional cases should be dealt with departmentally by the Ministry of Labour and the Treasury.      He was, however, willing to
defer a decision on this point for the present.THE COMLIITTSS AGREED :-(l)  To adopt the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that, to the utmost extent possible, Government unemployment relief schemes should he closed down hut that there should be no re-pudiation of commitments already undertaken^(2) That in pursuance of this policy the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee should be instructed forthwith to withhold approval of any 2iew schemes (either on the loan or the wages basis) submitted to them by local Authorities or Public Utility Un d e rt akin gs.Provided that nothing in this general instruction should prevent lord St. Davids1 Committee(1) from approving any schemes already under consideration by that Committee and in which the progress has been such as to give ttheir promoters reasonable expect-ation that the schemes would ultimately be sanctioned;    and(&apos;2)  from the exercise of the discretionrespecting future exceptional cases men-tioned in (A) below.(3) To take note that the decision in (2) above will givo a saving on the Unemployment Grants Votes of  300,000 in 1926-27 with substantially larger savings in subsequent years *(4) To defer for tho present the question of what arrangements will be necessary to deal with exceptional applications for Government assistance for relief schemes in specially necessitous areas a Pending a final decision on this question Lord St. Davids&apos;  Committee to have discretion to refer exceptional cases from specially distressed local-ities to the Treasury and Ministry of labour for favourable consideration.
