SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. REPORT&apos; OF THE ALUMINIUM HOLLOW-WARS COMMITTEE.To the Right Honourable Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B,E.,M.C.,M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,We were appointed on the 12th September, 1925 a Committee to enquire into and report upon the application made by the British Aluminium Hollow-ware Manufacturers&apos; Association for the imposition of a duty upon imported Aluminium Hollow-ware,  in accordance with the terms of the Memorandum (Cmd. 2327) relating to Procedure and Enquiry in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries, presented to Parliament on the 3rd February 1925,2, The Committee have held four Public meetings andhave head evidence from two witnesses on behalf of the Association and from one witness in opposition to the application and the Committee have themselves called evidence from an agent in this country of a foreign manufacturer and from three of the largest buyers of Aluminium Hollow-ware for retail sale, whose evidence v;as taken in earner a. The Statistical Department^ Board of Trade have furnished valuable memoranda dealing with various matters relating to the   enquiry.    The opposition weretepresented by Counsel, Mr. N.L,Macaskie.3. The opposition to the application came from one firmof Wholesale Import Merchants and Distributors who furnished U3 with the names of four or five other firms who he said were supporting him.4. The British Aluminium Hollow-ware Manufacturers&apos;Association came into existence about six years ago and comprises 23 firms engaged in the manufacture of Aluminium Hollow-ware in the United Kingdom out of a total number
of such manufacturers which the Applicants allege to be about 35.    This Association does not control prices or standardise wages and may be described as a voluntary Association for the discussion of matters of interest common to the trade.    The Applicants have submitted figures relating to production, export trade and numbers employedrelating to ten manufacturing firms. They state that these ten represent approximately 30.3 of the whole trade and their estimates of total pp oduction and numbers employed are made on this basis.We desire to state that the Information placed before us by the Applicants as regards production, export, employ-ment, unemployment and wages was far from complete, since we were asked to rely on estimates of the whole trade based on the returns of ten firms estimated to represent 30/o of the whole trade.5. Before the war Aluminium Hollow -ware was notmanufactured in this country to any considerable extent and a very large proportion of the Aluminium Hollow-ware sold in this country came from Germany. After the war a number of firms in this country began to manufacture Aluminium Hollow-ware and In 1920 produced 1,377 tons of which 327 tons were exported. They then employed about 3,500 hands.    By 1921 the number of hands employed had shrunk to approximately 2,000 and in 1922 to approximately 1,650: the quantities of Aluminium Hollow-ware imported from all countries in 1920, 1921 and 1922 being 425. tons, 713 tons and 1,693 tons respectively.    A duty of ZZ^/sfo on imported Aluminium Hollow-ware   -*as in force from the end of August, 1922 to 19th August, 1924 and the numbers employed were in 1923 approximately 2,000,in 1924 approximately 2,500 and to-day are estimated at just under 3,000.6. We now beg to report as follows with regard to the
&quot;instructions&quot; of the White Paper (Cmd. 2327). (1) 7/hether the Applicant Industry is, by reason of the volume of employment engaged In the production of the goods to which the application relates, or by reason of the nature of the goods produced, an Industry of substantial importance. 7. Prom the evidence as to the recent development of theindustry and its potentialities at home and abroad we are of opinion that it may be regarded as an industry of substantial Importance.8.   Vflaether foreign goods of the class or description to which the application relates are being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantitiestWe have experienced great difficulty in forming any idea as to what would be a normal annual quantity of imported Aluminium Hollow-ware since the industry was in its infancy before the war, the use of Aluminium Hollow-ware not being common and the home production very small. We are^ therefore, dependent upon the figures relating to post-war trade. Having regard also to the economic conditions which have existed both here and on the Continent since the war it is difficult to arrive at a normal figure.The following table sets out in tons weight the export trade, the home trade, the total home prodiictlon and the total imports from all countries:-m	(2)		.........(4)	( 5)		Sold for	Total	Total Import.Year.

-? i h413Columns (?) and (4) are based on estimates, supplied by the applicants. The figures of Total Exports and Imports for 1925 are estimates based on the figures for the first nine months and assume that the same rates of export and import continue: the figures for Home Trade for 1925 are estimates obtained by doubling those furnished us for the first six months of 1925. 9. Germany is the only serious competitor that we needconsider in this Industry, Imports from Germany throughout the five and a half years have always exceeded 80,2 of the total imports and it is of German competition that the Applicants complain.    It is obvious that conditions in Germany in 1920 were such as adversely to affect German exports of Aluminium Hollow-ware to this country.    The year 1921 is the nearest approach we have to a normal year as conditions in Germany were then somewhat more settled and the possibility of a duty being imposed on Aluminium Hollow-ware Imported into this country would not have affected the volume of such imports until towards the end of that year. In 19 22 the heavy imports were obviously in anticipation of a duty which was imposed in August. 1922.    It will be seen that the total imports of 425 tons in 1920 amounted to 29$ of the total home consumption of 1,475 tons (obtained by adding a home production of 1,050 for home trade and imports of 425 tons) and that in 1921 the total Imports of 713 tons formed 46$ of a total home consumption of 1,553 tons (obtained by adding a production of 840 tons for home trade and imports of 713.) Ignoring the imports of the last quarter of 1921, the sudden increase In which was undoubtedly due to fear of a duty, and basing figures for imports on the quantity of 420 tons imported during the first three quarters of the year, then a total import of 550 tons (estimated) in 1921 would have amounted&apos;to 40$ of a total home consumption of 1,400 (obtained by adding a production for home trade of 840 tons and an estimated import of 560 tons),
ft jl jFor 1935 estimated total imports of 514 tons amount to 30% of an estimated home consumption of 1,734 tons (obtained by-adding an estimated home production of 1,220 tons and an estimated import of 514 tons).Re-exports have been negligible in amount throughout. It will be noticed that in arriving at the foregoing percentages we have excluded entirely the appreciable Tonnage produced in this country but exported therefrom.10. Having regard to the position as analysed in the preceding paragraph we are unable to find upon any basis of comparison with past years that Aluminium Hollow-ware, is being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom In abnormal quantities and consequently aocording to our interpretation of Clause 2 of the instructions given in the White Paper, we are not in a position to state that the applicant industry has established a claim to a duty,11. The following general observations may be of service tothe Board of&quot;Trade.    The evidence as to the prices at which imported goods are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom has been very conflieting but we are satisfied that In the majority of Aluminium Hollow-ware articles,  save in some cheaper grades, the British manufacturer is fairly able to meet any competition which is at present being offered. Evidence obtained by the Committee from large London buyers for retail sale is to the effect that at least 80;&apos; of the Home Trade in Aluminium Hollow-ware is in the hands of the - British manufacturers. It would appear that owing to some advantage as regards the wages paid, the German manufacturer can in certain light gauge articles in which labour costs form a predominant feature, produce at a cost below the cost of production in this country.
12. We are satisfied that the portion of the Industryrepresented by the Applicants is carried on In this country with efficiency t*nd economy.    Having regard to the remarks relative to inefficiency on costings made in the Report of the Aluminium Hollow-ware Committee of 1922 we devoted some time to this subject and, having examined with care the costings systems of two of the principal firms of manufacturers in this country, we are satisfied that their methods are efficient and we have no reason to think that In this regard they are not representative of the Industry as a whole,15. It should be noted that the Home retained trade and theExport trade both show indications of an improving volume reviewing the position from 1920 to the present time.14. In concluding this Report we desire to express ourwarm appreciation of Mr. S.&apos;&quot;&apos;.Hood&apos;s services, who as our Secretary has been most helpful to us at all   stages of the Enquiry.(Signed),    F.R. DAVENPORT.Chairman.A. W , KIR KALDY. I.J. HAYWARD,12th November, 1925.S.W.H00D.Secretary.
