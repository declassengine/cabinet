My defer Buldano, October 17th, 1925.It is most unlucky that you were way from ourdisoussion on Dye stuffs;   but a decision by tho Committeehad absolutely to be conic to in tho course of this weekand delay ww3 impossible.    I foci confidant that if youb&amp;d/bcca with us you would have tutrced to the ooursowe/have tskon./        It must bo remembered that we fc&amp;ve no ^ower toprevent the Dye Stuffs Corporation going into liquidation,
and from a commercial point of view they would have some justification for such a course.    They are undoubtedly hampered by limitations which apply neither to their Gorman nor to their British rivals t-.nd they arc losing heavily.    I feel just as strongly as you do the necessity of encouraging the greater employment of organic chemists in our industrial processes, and there is no doubt that we are far behind both Germany and Switzerland and I believe Amoricp in this respect.    But I do not believe it is possible to force a Company in which tho investing public are largely interested to pursue a policy which (in their hftids at least) is unprofitable.    If they had tho technical knowledge of the S?/iss Company, which under a British nt.mo (which I happen to forget) is doing extremely well, or if they were managed with the skill and enterprise of &quot;Scottish Dye Stuffs&quot;, things might be different.    As it is, I do not believe any more than the Directors themselves, that they can make a good job of their present under-teking.   As things arc tho Government have no means of compelling them to encourtgc research on c Is rge socle ahd they are without doubt subject to hampering limitations to which none of their rivals, domestic or foreign, have to submit.    I doubt greatly whether the Scottish Dye Company would endure thorn for a moment.I shall not bo present when the subject comes before the Cabinet next Wednesday, but I hive had your Memorandum printed and circuit ted to the Cabinet.Yours ever, (Si;.nod)    Ba^OUH. P.S.    I understand that the-1 great German Combine of colour manufacturers nukes all its profits out of bye-products which tho British Dyo Stuffs Corporation are precluded from manufacturing.rngmagga......mm......&apos;km BBaSaMra^
