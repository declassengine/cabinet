This document if the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.HA BINE T..P.448(S5)HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.PETROLEUM BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I circulate herewith for the information of the Home Affairs Committee a draft of a Bill to amend the Petroleum Acts,  1871 and 1879.      This Bill is a considerably modified form of the Bill that was submitted for the approval of the Home Affairs Committee in February,   1923,   (CP. 38 (S3)) and introduced in the House of Lords in the same month.      It will be remembered that some of the provisions of that Bill aroused great opposition on the part both of the oil companies and other bodies and was referred to a Select Committee  of the House of Lords.      In view of the report of that Committee, the controversial proposals have been dropped and the present Bill is limited to a few amendments of the existing law which are urgently required in the interests of public safety. The most important of the provisions are those which give power to the Secretary of State to make gener al regulations governing the conveyance of petroleum spirit by road and provide for the making of byelaws in regard to loading of ships with petroleum spirit in harbour,  and for investigation of accidental     The Bill has been prepared in consultation with representatives of the chief Oil Companies, and is now in a form which the Oil Companies are prepared to accept. It has also been examined by the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Transport, who concur in its proposals.      I consider it of importance that the Bill should
29th October,  1925.-2- Jbe passed without delay.      In particular the present absence of control over road transport of -petroleum spirit and other dangerous substances has led to serious accidents in the past and will lead to more in the future,  unless the present defect  in the law is remedied.      Apart from the general need, the powers would be of special importance  in the event of a public emergency.      I do not anticipate any opposition to the Bill and I ask for authority for its early introdua tion.W.J.H.
