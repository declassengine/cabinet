Cosgrave on the evening of Friday, 27th November.   The Prime Minister had with him Sir John Anderson, Mr. Thomas Jones and Mr. C.P. Duff.     The Irish Representatives arrived for lunch, and the discussion began at 2-45 p.m.Earlier in the morning the Boundary Commission had Indicated that tley regarded It as so important that the parties should be cognisant of their award that they were despatching the Secretary of the Commission (Mr&apos;. Bourdillon) with all the necessary papers to Chequers,     The Secretary was requested to delay setting out for Chequers until the Prime Minister had an opportunity of mentioning the matter to Mr. 0&apos;Higgins.     On his arrival the Prime Minister informed Mr. 0&apos;Higgins of this;    and, as Mr. 0&apos;Higgins agreed that it would be well for the Secretary with the award to be on the spot, even if they did not avail themselves of his information, arrangements were made for Mr-. Bourdillon to arrive at Chequers at 4-30 p,m.The Prime Minister having referred to this arrangement Mr. 0&apos;Higgins then explained the situation which had arisen on Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s return to Ireland after his meetings in London on November 25th.
At 4-0 p.m. the Prime Llnister withdrew and conferred with Sir John Anderson and Lr . Jones.     At 4-20 p,m, the Prime kinister saw the Irish Representatives alone, and informed them that Sir John Anderson would see Sir Janes Graig that evening.At 5-0&apos;clock, after an interval for tea, the Prime linistervery briefly summarised the position reached in the earlier discussion.     He said that there emerged two alternatives, eachooliticalpresenting very serious/difficulties.     The one was to accept the existing boundary.      That, in the view of the Free State Representatives, would only be possible if it were sccompanied by important and far-reaching concessions on the part of Northern Ireland,     They asked, not only that prisoners should be liberated, but that the Cetholic population in Ulster should have their civic rights completely restored.Failing to obtain these concessions there remained the second course - to impose the award of the Boundary Commission. If this were done, and while the Free State Representativeswoulc&apos;might formally accept it, the political reactions would be grave and/Free Stateundoubtedly involve the fall cf the present/Government.The Prime Minister undertook to invite Sir James Craig to Chequers and the Free State Representatives agreed to return to Chequers with a view to meeting Sir James Craig at noon tomorrow, Sunda y, 29th K overaber ,It was agreed to issue a notice to the Press to the effect that conversations were proceeding.The representative of the Boundary Commission arrived at 4-30 p.m.     Although the Irish Representatives were not disposed themselves to see him or to peruse the documents he brought, they informed the. Prime liinister that it would be with their-concurrence that he should do so after their departure that evenln
About 5-15 p.in. the Free State Representatives returned to town.     At 5-30 p.m. the Prime Minister received the Secretary of the Boundary Commission.     Mr. Bourclillon handed to the Prime -Minister the following documents in duplicate:.-(1)   Letter from the Chairman of the Commission covering a Resolution adopted by the Boundary Commission today (circulated herewith).

OOx-Y Off A LETTER FROM TEE OEAIELAM OP THE IRISH BOUNDARY OOhd.lSSION TO.TEE PRlTvIE MINISTER.Irish Boundary Commission, 6, Clemonfs Inn, London, %* 0.2*28th November, 1925*Sir,As you will be aware the Irish Boundary Commission, at its interview with representatives of the British Government  on Tuesday, November   24th, raised the question as to the giving of preliminary information in advance to the Governments concerned as to the general character of the award about to be delivered, and expressed the view that it was desirable that any such preliminary information should be given simultaneously to both the British Government and tho Government of the Irish Free St at s.It was suggested that in the first instance the information should be jSLyon by means of an inspection of maps at a meeting to be arranged between the representatives of the two Governments and the Commission; the date suggested for this meeting was Thursday, 26th November.    A letter was despatched on 24th November oonveying this suggestion to the Government of the Irish Eree State, and a copy of that letter was forwarded to the British Government.    Beithor Govornment was able to accept the invitation for Thursday, tho 26th, and the Commission has been expecting to hear further with regard to this matter, but has not yet received from either Government any definite suggestion as to a date for the proposed meetingoIn the circumstances that have arisen it appears to the Commission to bo desirable that the Governments concerned should without further delay have before them definite preliminary information as to the nature of the award which is being prepared for delivery,  embodying the lino agreed upon by tho Commission^, The general features of this line were approved by the Commission and fully recorded with illustrative tracings in the Minutes of the Commission of the 17th October: certain minor detail
adjustments were approved at a further meeting of the Commissionheld on the 4th November.    It was estimated by the Commissionsadvisors that the prepara&quot;ion of a fullf detailed descriptionwith three sets of the necessary inaps on a six inch scale wouldtake six weeks from the 17th October: tho work: of preparingthis description and the maps is now nearly completed.Under authority of a resolution of the Commission adopted to-day, copy of which is attached, I forward herewith for the confidential information of the British Government and theGovernment of Northern Ireland the Memorandum referred to intho resolution, which I have initialled,,   I also enclose underauthority of the same resolution   - ,     v(1)     A quarter inch scale map feo^^feesv tho line as about tobe determined by the Commission;(2)     *ja advanoe proof of a chapter of the Commissions Reportdealing with the general principles forming the basis of the -aftardwhich is to be delivered,    This proof has not yet actually beencorrected for the printer^, but may be taken as substantiallycorrect.Owing to the position created by Doctor LicEeill&apos;s withdrawal from the Commission it has been necessaey to prepare a report in some detail for presentation with the award.    This course had not previously been contemplated.    In order te jallow time for the completion and printing of this report a few further days are required,    The Commission now proposes to complete and deliver its award on Monday, the 7th December.    TheCommission contemplates that it may be desirable in the -public&apos; 1interest to publish the information contained in the memorandum 1at an earlier date, but on this point the Commission-will be. glad 1to consider the views of the Governments concerja^d.
