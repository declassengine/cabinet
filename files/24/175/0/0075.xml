CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY&apos; ..^05This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ;ECRET.CABINET.,p. 475(85) . -_ - pHOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.CONVENTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING- WORKMEN&apos;S COMPENSATION ADOPTED AT THE LAST INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The Draft Conventions and Recommendations which wereiadopted at the Seventh Session of the International Labour Conference in June last comprised the following, relating to matters falling within the sphere of the Home Office:-(l) Draft Convention concerning Workmen&apos;s. Compensation for Accidents.(2) Recommendation concerning the minimum scale of Workmen&apos;s Compensation.(3) Recommendation concerning jurisdiction in disputes on Workmen&apos;s Compensation.(4) Draft Convention conoerning Workmen&apos;s Compensation for Occupational Diseases.(5) Recommendation concerning Workmen&apos;s Compensation-for Occupational Diseases.(6) Draft Convention concerning equality of treatment for national and foreign workers as regards Workmen&apos;s Compensation for- accidents.(7) Recommendation concerning equality of treatment for national and foreign workers as regards Workmen&apos;s Compensation for accidents.(8) Draft Convention concorning night work in bakeries.Of these Conventions 1 and 8 and Recommendations 2 and. 3 cannot be accepted - for reasons with which I need not trouble the Committee.    But as regards the four remaining Conventions and Recommendations - Nog. 4, 5; 6 and 7-1 am of opinion that they should be ratified and adopted as soon as possible.    The proposals they contain already form part of the existing law in this country j; and their acceptance will not. therefore,  involve any legislative
16th November,  1925.or administrative  changes nor will- any additional burden be imposed thereby on British industry,    On the contrary it may reasonably be expected that any encouragement which this country can give to others to follow our example in ratifying will act to the advantage&apos; of British industry since the law relating to Workmen&apos;s Compensation is more favourable to workmen in this country than is the law in that of any foreign Member of the League of Nations,It will be remembered that a Committee of the Cabinet made certain recommendations as to the policy to bo pursued generally in dealing with International Conventions.     (Cabinet Conclusions 23(25) Appendix).    The course 1 propose is, I think,  in accordance with the spirit of these recommendations, but I think it right to bring my proposals to the notice-of my colleagues.
