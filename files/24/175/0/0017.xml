i -7HFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,totg DO GUM EN T IS IHlS PROPSUTY OF HIS BRITANBIO MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT.I.P.417 (25) 0 A B.-.I H E T, - qSAFEGUARDING OP INDUSTRIES.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1.   An Application has been received by the Board of Trade from the Bradford and District Manufacturers&apos; Federation, the Keighley and District Manufacturers1 Federation and the Textile Commission Manufacturers&apos; Association, for the Imposition of a duty upon &quot;all dyed or undyed imported tissues or fabrios (whether in the piece or any other form) of any weight from 2 ounces per square yard up to and including 11 ounces per square yard made wholly or partly of wool or hair&quot;.2. It is clear that the Associations are entitled to speak for substantially the whole of the Worsted industry, and although there may be some doubt, owing to deficiency of Statistical evidence, whether their case complies in eVery respect with the conditions laid down in the White Paper, it would not in my opinion be justifiable to refuse to appoint a Committee to enquire into the position.3. The industry is unquestionably of substantial importance on account of the volume of employment.   According to the Census of 1921 some 120,000 persons were engaged in the Wool Combing, Worsted Spinning and Weaving Industry as a whole, the number employed in Worsted Weaving alone being about 55,000.4. The industry is undoubtedly suffering severely from foreign competition, but it is difficult to ascertain the exact trade position.   No comparison of imports with pre-war
S4years is possible, because the import statistics did not until 1920 distinguish between woollens and worsteds.   Since 1920 the returns have not distinguished the precise olasses of goods in respect of which application is made, and there is no doubt that a large quantity of worsteds has in fact been returned as woollens.   Imports of worsteds have on the whole been rising rapidly in recent years, and they are still increasing, though they are probably even nov? smaller in volume than in 1913.   The Applicants point out that the imports consist predominantly of drees goods, and claim that, (having regard to the shrinkage In consumption  of cloth consequent on present fashions in womai&apos;s dress and reduced purohaelng power) imports represent fully as large a proportion of the British consumption of dress goods as they did before the war.   They oontend that in view of the great reduction of employment, caused by the diminution of the export trade and the greatly reduced consuming power of the home trade,  the present rate of import can only be described as abnormal.5. The percentage of unemployment in the Woollen and Worsted industry at the end of July 1925, according to the Ministry of Labour was 21.3 while many workers were on short time.6. The foreign competition complained of comes largely from France and other Continental countries, and the Applicants put forward evidence to show that the wages paid abroad ar^ much lower than those paid in this country (e.g. in the French worsted industry little more than half). Unfair competition is aggravated in France and Borne other countries by        continued depreciation of the currency.7,    There is no oall to refuse an enquiry on the ground of any inefficiency of the industry in this country, since it is unquestionably efficient.
8. Nor could the application be rejected on the only other ground provided in the White Paper as a reason for rejection, namely,  that the imposition &quot;?f a duty would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment in industries using the goods in production.   There seems no reason to fear that this would be the case.9. Under the White Paper,if the Board of Trade are -satisfied that a prima fade case is established, the Board are to refer the claim for enquiry to a Committee.   I am satisfied that there is a prima facie oase.10*   The Cabinet have already approved the imposition of duties on leather and fabric gloves and on gas mantles.    I expect to reoeive reports on brooms and brushes,wrapping paper, hollow-ware, and possibly on out-lory,   by the end of October.   The Cabinet will have to deoide whether a Finance Bill shall be passed in the Autumn Session, dealing with the duties already approved and any others whioh may he sanctioned.   As such a Bill would he confined to these specific duties, It oould be passed fairly rapidly through all its stages, and it would be unnecessary to pass legislation repealing    the Bowles Act in the Autumn Session.(Intd.) P.C-L.Board of Trade,6th October, 1925.
