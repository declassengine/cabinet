0  JD__P__Ye.Admiralty,Whitehall,LONDON, S.W.1,16th September, 1925.My dear Stanley,.The announcement of the Admiralty&apos;s decision that owing to reduction in the work it was necessary in the interests of economy to close down two Dockyards at least, reducing them to a &quot;care and maintenance&quot;  staff - to which I referred in my letter to you of the 20th August -has naturally aroused strong protests from the neighbour-hood of the two Dockyards Rosyth and Pembroke who are making every effort to rouse Scotch and Welsh opinion against it, and get the decision reversed.To-day I received a deputation from Dunf erailine and district,  introduced by Adams on who said he was trying to get an interview with youeTheir main request was that no discharges should be made before Parliament meets 0    This is very unreasonable, as we are - constantly having to discharge men for whom we have no employment in the  course of our ordinary adminis-tration, and we should have to discharge a lot of men on account of  the reduction in new construction and repairs in any case, whether the Yards wero closed down or not,I said I could not rescind the notices which have already been given,  affecting some 250 men I think, hut would consider  the rate of discharge of men in future to see if it could be spread over a longer period0There/
There will no doubt be a good deal of support for those who wish to resist throwing employes of the Government out of work In times like these.   But the only way to keep them on would be for the Cabinet to say that in order not to aggravate unemployment they authorised the Admiralty to spend a sufficient sum of money on repair work to avoid further discharges.     To do so would of course prevent our realising some of the savings which we undertook to try and make In order to meet the  cost of new construc-tion in future years .Another request was that some compensation should be paid to the ratepayers of Dunf ermline for the loss they may sustain, from finding their outlay on improvements required for the dockyard population unremunerative,   This I said should be considered, and I think it is reasonable, It must be borne in mind that owing to such necessary compensation, and owing to the necessity of giving separa-tion allowances to men who are transferred to the Southern Dockyards before homes can be found for them there, the saving in this and  the next financial year will be a negligible amount, but In future years it will be a con-siderable saving in overhead charges etc.As the announcement was made by the Admiralty as part of  their policy of saving,  it is of course open to you and the Cabinet to require -that it be reconsidered, and one of the objects in making the announcement when we did was to draw out all the criticisms,  and leave the Cabine unpledged on the subject e   At the same time I feel that we oufeht to continue the policy of closing these yards,  and probably Sheerneso later, even If It Is done more graduallythan /
1^3than was at first intended, as it is really an extravagance to keep so many Government dockyards *       The reasons for closing these two yards were carefully weighed and I append the short memorandum of the Director of Dockyards on the subjectcYours ever, (Sgd 6)      W, 0. BRIDGRMAN .
APPENDIX   I    to    CP, 422(25)0Statement made to Press representatives by the Director of Dockyards on 9th September,1925pThe Admiralty have recently been making considerable reductions in the number of ships in commission and reserve, and in consequence found themselves in possession of more dockyard accommodation at home than was necessary0    Careful consideration was then given as tq whether it was possible to close down some of the yards0The conclusion was arrived at that two of the yards of the least value to the Navy under existing conditions could be dispensed with-, on the understanding that they and their machinery were kept thoroughly efficient for re-openin, at  any time that might be necessarycRosyth was one of the yards chosen and this has given rise to some criticism on the score of it being the most modern yard we possess0It has been suggested that Chatham should have been closed in preference to Rosyth?That suggestion might have been considered had Rosyth been completed in accordance with the original designj as it is the work was only proceeded with to the extent necessary to deal with Capital Ships during the war; there is no pro-vision at Rosyth fov dealing economically with Gruisers3 Destroyers, Submarines and Small Craft,To put it into a condition suitable for the general needs of the Fleet would entail a very large expenditure; on the other hand Chatham is the principal yard for large refits of Cruisers anj Des^r0yers^ work which Rosyth is not in a position to undertake0    The claim for Chatham to remain in commission in preference to Rosyth is overwhelming.Since the war  aid the consequent redistribution of the&apos; Fleet,  the only essential reason for keeping Rosyth open has &amp; *i
2 &quot;been in order to dock the bulged battleships of the Atlantic Fleet and the Battle Cruisers t.   By   the end of the  current year the floating dock at Devonport will be in position, and all vessels can then be docked in the Southern Ports eTo keep Ilosyth opon under those conditions would be an unwarranted extravagance0The other Yard it was decided to  close is Pembroke.here again it has been urged that Sheerness should have been closed and Pembroke retained ,   The main consideration-tion which led the Admiralty to decide on Pembroke is the fact that Pembroke is essentially a building yard and Sheernes essentially a repair yard 4For economical reasons ships must be repaired in a Government Yard, but they need not necessarily be built there 6Pembroke Yard is not in the same modem state of equipment as Sheerness 6Sheerness has been specially equipped for dealing with the repairs of Submarines and Destroyers; it has vory good basin accommodation, whereas  Pembroke 1ms none,Sheerness is the large store depot for all ships abroad considerable expense, including the building of storehouses elsewhere, would be involved if these stores had to be moved0Sheerness is a port off which HCM.Ships lay, when givin, leave, etc, during which periods minor repairs are carried out by the Yard ePembroke is a, port which rarely sees a man of war unless especially sent there for refit 0The Admiralty were convinced that Sheomess meets the present needs of the Fleet to a far greater extent than does Pembroke 0

Suoh transfers of established.....and permanentemployees will necessitate some discharges of hired and temporary people at presont serving at tho other establish&apos; ments referred to.     The number of such discharges may amount to :-accontuate still further the housing difficulty in the towns concerned,, it will also cost a sum of money in transfer expenses and lodging allowances which will largely counter-balanoe any saving that might otherwise have accrued next yoar on account of the redaotioiu     It may be that, if sufficiently generous inducement were offered, many of the established men might be prepared to take their discharge at the two Yards instead of being transferredo     The saving in transfer expenses and. lodging allowances, though consider-able would not bo sufficient in itself on which to frame a scheme for optional retirement attractive enough   to appeal to the bulk: of those concerned;    and the Treasury view in the past has been opposed to the grant of retiring terms in excess of tir&amp; normal rates to dockyard employees compulsorily retired before attaining the age of 60*     Unless, therefore, the Government decides to troat the present reductions in an exceptional manner, the transfers are unavoidable.Che financial effect of reducing the Yards to a Oare and Maintenance basis may be summarised as follows:-700The transfer of so many people to other Yards will1985-S6 f -1926-27    -/Net Total 18,910  10,625 24,875 55 ,500D It iraat e ly 91,325    236,375 327,700/ IIoto ,   TheThe savings in 19 25- 26 and 1926-27 are largely savings due to reduction in capital expenditure.
