IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY&apos; OF HIS BRITANNIC KAJLSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CRET.P.. 431 (25).cabinet trade Outlook.Note by the President of the Board of Trade,I circulate the last monthly review of Trade prospects which I have received from my Advisory Council.I should add that on visiting Manchester yesterday I found a definite feeling of optimism in the cotton trade. This is based on a heavy American cotton crop, good cereal crops generally and a prevailing shortage of stocks throughout the world, rather than on actual orders received.   But there is undoubtedly a conviction that the trade will   improve.(Intld.) P.C-L,Board of Trade,15th October, 192 5,

IRON AND STEEL.MR. DORMAN expressed regret that he could not give a cheerful roport on the iron and steel trade.   He handed in figures (reproduced at tho end of this paragraph) showing that the pig iron produced had fallen in August to 444,000 tons and the steel produced to 477,000 tons, which were very low figures, but it was to be remembered that August was a holiday month and that production was never at its greatest then.   The imports and exports showed a serious tendency to which he would draw attention.   The imports were increasing and the exports steadily decreasing,- and whereas in 1913 there was an average monthly excess of about 330,000 tone of exports over imports, this excess had fallen in August last to 55,000 tons, which of course was a position which they viewed with the gravest anxiety.Orders were very scarce for most products.    Shipbuilding, of course, was very bad indeed.    The wire trade was also very bad, in fact he had never known the wire trade in such a difficult state as it was to-day.   It was being lost to Belgium and Germany.One bright spot was the black and galvanised sheet trade, Japan was buying black sheets, and South America also was increasing its purchases.   Galvanised sheets were in a very healthy condition.    Secondly, constructional steel, for steel frame buildings, etc, was a fairly busy branch of trade.With regard to the effect on the iron and steel trade of the coal subvention,  they had only one month&apos;3 figures as yet. In the month of August they got their coal s/Sd. a ton cheaper, which equalled, say 8/sd. or so per ton decrease in the cost of the finished steel.   Mr. Dorman&apos;s firm had, however, obtained no benefit at all from this because they were making a great effort, which it did not follow would be successful, to cut prices to such an extent as to keep their trade.    Continental semi-finished material had been further reduced, and one could buy billets at  4.17.6,  and sheet bars at  4.18.6,  c.i.f. British ports, and as the result of their effort to compete, they had given away more than the 8/6d. per ton benefit they had received from the coal subvention.    He did not think that their Belgian competitors were making money in selling billets at  4.17.6.The production for this August being the lowest monthly total recorded since September, 1922.STATISTICS GIVEN BY MR. DORMAN AT BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL MEETING, OCTOBER 7th,  1935.Production of Pig Iron in August &quot; &quot;      &quot;      &quot;      &quot; July..August.........444,510 tonsJuly........,. 492,700 tons and august  (1924). 588,900 tons.ii ii      it      t?      it
CONFIDENTIAL * IRON AND STEEL  (Contd.)There were 136 furnaces In blast at end of August,  the same number as was in blast at the end of July,  5 furnaces having blown in and 5 blown out during the month.In August 1924 the number of furnaces in blast was 173.Production of steel ingots and castings during:-August 1925 477,100 tonsJuly     1925 590,400   &quot;August 1924 527,500    &quot;Imports of Iron and Steel:-August 1925 232,800 tons,being an inorease of 19,800 tons over July,Exports of Iron and Steel:-August 1925 287,800 tonsJuly     1925 306,600 tons.Margin between Imports and Exports in August this year therefore was 55,000 tons in favour of Exports.Average monthly Exports in 1913 were 414,IOC tons, while in August 1925,  the Exports were 287,800 tons.Average monthly Imports in 1913 were 185,900 tons, whereas in August 1925 the Imports amounted to 232,800 tons.MR. BAKER wrote.on 16th September.-&quot;I have nothing of an &quot;encouraging nature to report.     The Iron and Steel trade has &quot;great difficulty in securing orders and, whilst one hears &quot;of a Mill opening up in one place,  information comes to hand &quot;of others closing down elsewhere, and my impression is that &quot;employment is actually worse in the trade than a month ago&quot;.ENGINEERING.SIR GLYNN 1/VEST said he was able to confirm generally the report which Mr. Dor man had given.    The wire business which he had touohed upon was in a very bad state just now, and it appeared that the competition came chiefly from Belgium, There was great prosperity in the motor oar Industry, a nd the fair demand for tool steel, which also existed, was probably-due chiefly to that.     It was noticeable that there were several new motor-car factories going up, and among the people who were building them, and also extending existing works, were some coming over from America.     Sir Glynn was, however, a little anxious as to whether the great demand for motor cars was altogether a satisfactory development.    The greater part of the production of motor cars must be called a luxury trade.     In regard to the machine tool trade,  that had improved a little bit, no doubt In connexion with motor oar manufacture
ENGINEER BIG  (C ontd .) .In general machinery he could not see any improvement at all.    It was very difficult to get orders. The ship-building industry was no better.   One or two tankers were being ordered, and some other special ships;    but the general ship-building business has probably never been worse.SHIPBUILDING.SIR JAMES LITHGOW wrote,- &quot;1 can distinguish no light on &quot;the horizon of the Shipbuilding industry, orders being &quot;extremely scarce, and foreign and internal competition for the &quot;same very fierce.   Generally speaking,  it appears to me that &quot;Shipowners are in a less confident mood than they were a year &quot;ago, and until something comes along to restore this &quot;confidence we must look forward to a continuance of the &quot;present depression&quot;.    He disagreed with the optimism of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and wished that he would show on what such optimism was based.electrical INDUSTRY.SIR H. HIRST wrote.-&quot;Business in the Electrical Industry generally, has not shown any great signs of improvement, but on the whole the level of the last Report has been maintained. The actual amount of incoming work is not smaller than at the corresponding period of last year, but this is due to an improvement in the London area counter-balancing a drop In other parts of the country.    The Increase In London may be due partly to the large number of visitors to the Metropolis, and of course, fluctuations in the Industrial World are not so Immediately felt in London as in provincial centres such as Glasgow, Newcastle, and Cardiff.    In these latter areas, which are so directly and indirectly dependent on the Shipbuilding, Steel -&amp; Coal Industries for their prosperity, business-,&apos; generally speaking, consists of a number of small orders with an absence of large contracts.&quot;Features which have tended to maintain the level of business, have been the greater activity in the building world, and also the efforts of Electric Supply Companies, to increase their load and to undertake development work in various directions.    The state of the heavy industries of the country, Shipbuilding, Steel &amp; Iron Wprks, etc., has naturally re-acted on the Heavy Engineering business, where conditions are still extremely quiet, very little work of any importance having been placed.    The effect of Continental competition is also being felt.
ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY (Contd. )&quot;AUSTRALIA. Whilst, generally speaking, the volume of orders is being maintained, the new Tariff increasing Duties on Induction Motors of British manufacture from 27^% to 45$, and on Electric Light Switches, Puses, &amp;c., from 27-1$ to 35$, must make itself adversely felt in the near future.&quot;NEW ZEALAND.   Business is still good, but now that the majority of the Hydro-Electric Schemes are completed, or near completion, there will probably be a slackening off to a certain extent in big Plant.&quot;CHINA..   Business disorganised and very difficult on account of the general strike or labour boycott, now approximately three months old, subjecting the whole community, especially in Hong Kong, to great inconvenience and loss.   The lack of action by the British Government is very severely commented on in Hong Kong circles, and our latest reports are that conditions are considered serious.&quot;INDIA.   Competition in Electrical Goods of Continental manufacture is still very keen but our Sales are somewhat up in Calcutta and Bombay; the Madras figures, however, being poor,&quot;SOUTH AMERICA.    Continental Firms are competing severely arid German Companies still granting &quot;long term&quot; credits, as also in China.   Export Trade from the Argentine has not been very brisk of late - there being a lack of demand from Europe.&quot;F.M.S. The high prices of Tin and Rubber should tend to improve business in the near future&quot;COAL.SIR ADAM NIMMO considered that the coal industry could only be described as being in a very deplorable condition.   The figures which had been circulated at the meeting (and are reproduced as an appendix to these notes) showed that the output was running just now not appreciably above 230 million tons per annum, compared with 287 million tons in 1913 and 276 million tons in 1923, - the latter comparatively high figure being, no doubt, due to the special difficulties in the Ruhr.    Comparing the month of August of this year with the month of August last year, we had a reduction in output of about 3-g- million tons. The situation, of course,was worst in connection with the export trade, and the fall there, comparing August 1925 with August 1924, was as much as 1,802,000 tons.     Unemployment in the industry was Increasing pretty quicklyj and, again
COAL   (Contdhcomparing the month of August,1925, with August,1924, there was an increase in unemployment of very nearly 15$.     The number of persons employed in the industry also showed a very substantial reduction.It was not possible to indicate any definite improve-ment existing at the present time or discernible in the immediate future, although they had been told by some re-presentative coal exporters at a meeting the previous evening that there appeared to be evidences at the moment that we were beginning to hold our own against German competition, and that the immediate tendency of German prices seemed rather to be to rise than to fall further.Sir Adam did not think that the coal subvention by itself was having any effect upon prices.     These, broadly speaking, were being determined by the economic situation; and taking the figures as a whole, it was quite clear that we could not find trade even for the present output.   No doubt, however, the subsidy was assisting the collieries to hold on0As regards the rise in London coal prices, he thought that this had in some cases been the reflexion of a rise in pit prices, whilst in a good many cases it probably had not been0     There again the house coal price was affected by general economic considerations0     In the case of certain qualities of coal he had no doubt the collieries were able to get an increase in line with the general winter advance which takes place*    In other cases the quantity of coal that was in the market was more than the demand, and the coal owners in these cases naturally were not able to raise their prices.TEXTILES: COTTON.,COL.SEDDON BROWN observed that although there was no real improvement in the cotton trade, he could report the development of a slightly more hopeful and optimistic feeling.     Unfortunately, just when buyers throughout the whole world were arriving at a certain degree of confidence, the reports on the American crop became so contradictory that this confidence was badly shaken.     In his opinion there was no doubt that these   frequent reports of the Washington Bureau upset the cotton trade very seriously, and he had -had an opportunity of listening to gentlemen sent across specially from America to explain to the trade here the system of obtaining these reports and the secrecy with which they were tabulated.     Personally, he did not pay very much attention to the reports, but they disturbed the trade in general very seriously.
CONFIDENTIAL. TEXTILES: COTTON (Contd.).There was a slight improvement in fine counts; in the coarse trade the workers were still losing one day a week.    In spite of that, however, production seemed to be Btill in excess of the demand, which of course was causing severe price cutting In the coarse trade.   The cloth trade was undoubtedly bad, although some business was beginning to filter through from China, and he thought more business had developed in the last few weeks from Germany and Switzerland, and perhaps from North Europe generally, than they had had for some time.   As regards the home trade, this also could only be described as bad. Colonel Seddon Drown had had some figures taken out as regards the concerns with which he was connected, and it was significant to note that in these concerns thoy had now as many open accounts as in the very busiest times, yet the amount of business accruing from them was very much reduced,  showing markedly how the lower earnings of other trades were affecting sales in the retail shops.When trade was as bad as it had been, the retailer was able to push tho burden of carrying stocks back on to the manufacturers. The retailerfs and tho merchant&apos;s stocks throughout the world were undoubtedly very lowj therefore there was a gap ready to be filled up, and merchant and shippers and everybody interested in the movement of cloth had begun to feel that the price of l/- per lb. for raw cotton was such that they oould move up cloth to the distributing centres in the world; and if they had not had those contradictory reports trade might be better now than it was three months ago.   Now, none of the merchants could determine whether l/- was a reasonable price, and we should have to know something more definite about the crop and the prices that are likely to rule.MR. JUDSON said that the position was disappointing because usually October, with the arrival of the American cotton crop, has been coincident with profitable and whole time working.   But the market was now in such a nervous state that when cotton went up merchants did not rush in to buy, thinking it was going higher; and if it went down they ceased buying because they thought it would go down further.    Tho price was still too high-Indian merchants did not carry big stocks nowadays,  because of the high price.   The Hindoo was not getting the wages, or tho money   from the land, to buy the cloth as he did in pre-war days. Eis income had not increased in anything like the same ratio as the price of the cloth.   The Egyptian section had been bad during tho last few months, but there had been  an improvement because the Egyptian Government anticipated a crop there between 7 and 8 million kantares, which is an excellent crop.    In the American Bection there were more limited companies paying dividends than there had been for some years past, which showed at any rate that there were not the same losses now as were going on twelve months or two years ago.At the present time 39-1- hours per week were being worked In the American sectionj whole time working was being resumed in the Egyptian section.
CONFIDENTIAL.TEXTILES;  WOOL, ETC.MR. ANDREWS reoalled that there had been a dispute in the Woollen Trade which lasted about three weeks.   During that time, of course, there was a oertaln hold-up of orders which accumulated, and when the dispute was over these orders improved the outlook a little for the time being, and a little more machinery was got going.    Since then they had been wonder-ing whether this slight improvement was permanent or only due to the stoppage.   Now they were inclined to think that there was a genuine slight improvement as well as the slight accumulation of orders! and while the combing section was not much better, because there was a sufficient stock of combed tops to meet all requirements, the spinning was a little better and the manufacture also.   Mr. Andrews thought also   there was a certain clearing-out of stocks in merchants&apos; hands.   For the last two years merchants had been very shy of carrying stocks; consequently they had nothing much to fall back upon. The same thing had happened in the cotton trade.   Trade was so very bad that they were thankful for even this slight improve-ment.MR. SUTCLIFFE SHI5H confirmed what Mr. Andrews had baid. As regards the spindles, there were about 70$ or QOfo running because of the temporary spurt owing to the stoppage.   But the gravity of the position was that only 15,000 looms were working out of 30,000 looms in the Bradford and immediate district. There was, however, an improvement in the figures of employment and part-employment since the previous Council meeting.    Taken as a whole the trade was rather lifeless, although they found more enquiries being made, particularly from India   and China. Therewas a certain reluctance In placing orders, because buyers thought that there was a possibility of a drop In wool prices, and therefore they were only buying from hand to mouth.    Frenchcompetition was very strong, and also Italian,   However, the extreme pessimism that obtained in the district for the last three months was giving place to a somewhat more optimistic feeling.     Mr. Sutoliffe Smith suggested that speakers in public should lay stress on this faot and endeavour to view matters more optimistically, because individuals had become too pessimistic recently, and this found its reflection in the attitude of the nation as a whole.Mr. Sutcliffe Smith also referred to certain point in connection with the Trade Facilities Act, and the Portuguese Customs Tariff.POTTERY.MR. H0LLINS wrote -&quot;During the past two months - August and September - the unemployment during the latter part of August was much more sovere than either the corresponding period of last year, or for any month during the present year.&quot;There was a rapid improvement during September, and the lowest total number of claimants was registered for the year.
POTTERY  (Oontd.).&quot;The National Society of Pottery Workers paid  850 more in benefit to its members during the month of August, than In August 1934, but on the last week in September the total unemployment benefits paid, was slightly less than in the corresponding week of 1934.&quot;The returns from the Local Employment Exchanges will be submitted at the meeting of the Advisory Council,&quot;It is pleasing to note, that our Exports for the first eight months of this year are being maintained, with the exception of a very slight decrease both in quantities and values,&quot;From enquiries in the district, the outlook during the coming two or three months in Home Trade is very hopeful, and many Home Trade firms are working more days per week&quot;,CHEMICALS.MR, PERRY stated that,generally speaking,  the heavy chemical trade had not experienced any marked ohangeB lately, but the position now was, not materially, but slightly, unfavourable.   As against that it was to be noted that great success had been achieved in the manufacture of synthetic nitrogen.     That was now an established industry and a very valuable addition to our country!s operations.There was one rather disquieting factor to report. Mr. Perry had, at past meetings, referred to the very rapidly  .growing importation of foreign-made fertiliser, superphosphate, a problem which a Committee under the Safeguarding of Industries scheme had already considered.   He had always held that that problem was not a superphosphate problem but a sulphuric acid problem, because the sulphuric acid was much the most important part in the manufacture of superphosphate, and represented more than half its weight.     The Continent had now commenced direct competition in sulphurio acid.   A Dutch producer had taken contracts, and the first consignment of many that would follow had already reached London.   We would have to face the fact that the index commodity in the chemical industry of this country was being faced with foreign competition.In the fine chemical trade the volume of business had inoreased.   Many new articles had been added to the list of those we were making here.   Unfortunately, our expert trade in dyes still showed some depreciation,.
POOD INDUSTRIES.Mr. MACHIN said that the home market in these industries was holding its own and there appeared to be money for luxuries.    There was no definite increase, but the trade was being maintained fairly well.   So far as the export trade was concerned the position remained exceedingly difficult.    They had to fight and found the utmost difficulty in holding their own.    Indeed It was difficult to see how the position was to be relieved until cost of production had been brought down, so as to enable our people to compete in the world!s markets.    That was a very big subject which would have to be faced sooner or later.    In connection with the remarks made by one speaker as to the small stocks which were being held, that applied to the food industries equally with others. Orders were smaller, and it appeared that there was still a want of confidence as to the industrial outlook which was preventing people from taking in large stocks and ordering as freely as otherwise would be the case.    It was to be hoped that if that position could be cleared up, things would improve, but until we got our cost of production down the export trade was, as it seemed, in. a most parlous condition.SHIPPING.SIR ALAN ANDERSON observed that the shipping figures were about as bad as they could be.    The August freight figure was 23.6 of the figure for 1920, and just slightly above the 1913 freight figure, whereas expenses, he thought, were the same, or thereabouts.    The figure of British tonnage laid up in United Kingdom ports had gone up about 68% as compared with last year.    There had been a considerable diminution last year in British laid-up tonnage, but much of that tonnage was laid up again now. Of course these figures were very bad.    Tramp shipping was in a very depressed state, hut it was a fair indica-tion of the whole trade because It depended particularly on the coal trade;    and It was -the fluctuations of the coal and heavier mineral trades that affected tramp shipping so severely.Mr. Brand mentioned that he had heard from an Esthonian banker that the Russian Government had cancelled the charters of a number of ships which had been intended to carry away grain from the Black Sea.   Sir Alan Anderson said he would inquire into the matter.    (He has since written that the number of cancellations appears to have been something like 6.    The crop is late in coming down to the ports, and this has caused some confusion there).
MR. TENNANT handed in the trade reports from the branches of the Westminster Bank, an extract from which reports appears at the end of this section of these notes.-IDRAILWAY TRAFFIC.MR, HILL observed that at the last meeting of the Council it was stated that the railway receipts for passenger and merchandise traffic for the first thirty weeks of the year, (up to 2 6th July,) were down by about  1,400,000. At the end of August merchandise traffic receipts had fallen by  .2,300,000 as compared with the corresponding period last year.    On the 27th September the decrease amounted to nearly  3,000,000, of which passenger traffic accounted for about  500,000 and merchandise traffic  2,500,000.    The rate of decrease had thus been accentuated to a marked degree during August and September.   Put in the form of percentages, the decrease of receipts, compared with receipts for the corres-ponding periods of 1924, was: Vup to the end of July,&quot; and 4/o during August and September, making a total reduction for the first nine months of the year, of 2%,With regard to tonnages hauled, figures were now avail-able for June and July.    The figures for June this year were to some extent vitiated for the purpose of comparison with June of last year by having one extra working day.    June 1925 shewed an increase over June 1924 of about 20,000 tons In general merchandise, and-decreases of 995,000 tons in coal, coke, and patent fuel, and about 230,000 tons in other minerals--, making a total decrease of 1,205,000 tons, or rather less than 5% ojf the total.    In July last the tonnage of general merchandise was 192,000 tons less than in July 1924.    The tonnage of other minerals was 308,000 tons less. The tonnage of coal,v coke, and patent fuel exceeded the tonnage for July 1924, by 6)o or about 1,056,000 tons, and those figures accounted for an increase of the total tonnage hauled of about 556,000 tons or 2.0$.The increased coal traffic during July was no doubt due to anticipation of a stoppage at the mines .   During July the tonnage of pig iron hauled by the railways shewed some recovery; and slightly exceeded that for the corresponding month of last year.    Other traffics which showed marked increases were inflamable oils and some building materials, but generally the average tonnage of the heavier traffics was below the average of the year.   To take the figure up to the end of July, the total decrease of tonnage hauled by the railways, as compared with the same period in 1924, was in round figures 10,500,000 tons, of which coal accounted for 8,500,000 and other minerals for 1,600,000.GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING .
GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING (Oontd.).He was afraid that no general trade improvement was apparent. An exception might, however, be made with regard to the hosiery and boot and shoe trades which seemed to show some improvement; while the silk and motor oar industries continued to flourish.The figures for the Clearing Banks for the month of August showed, for the first time for many months, a decrease in advances, and he anticipated that for the month of September they would do so also.    In the oase of his own bank they did.   There had been practically no fresh issues during August and September, but during the last three days there had been three Corporation Issues, and a few more would probably be coming along.    The Bank of England had been losing a considerable amount of gold during the last few months. Since the gold standard was introduced on the 29th April, the highest nett   influx of gold had been  8,186,000.    It was now only  2,166,000.Since the Council1s last meeting the Bank Rate had been reduced on two occasions - on August 6th, from Sfa to and onOctober 1st from to 4^.   Latterly the Bank Rate had been quite ineffective, and even now, with a 4$ Bank Rate, Bank bills were not quite 3^8$.MR. PEASE, in handing in the trade- reports of Lloyds Bank (an extract from which is given at the end of this section) observed, in answer to a question from the President, that general engineering was reported to be quiet, though the makers of electrical plant and locomotives, in particular, were said to be doing rather better,- The features of the money market during the last month were more or less common knowledge, the easing of rates, followed by the drop in the Bank Rate, and the efflux of gold.    This easing of rates had occurred in spite of that efflux and the exchange in New York being against us.   All money rates in New York were higher and were giving a better return on billB,Mr. Pease remarked that it was sometimes very difficult to draw any direct conclusions, from banking figures, as to the state of trade generally.   Mr. Tennant had stated that for the last couple of months advances had been decreasing.   During the previous six or twelve months, however, banking advances generally had been inoreasing, and that, in the ordinary state of things, would tend to show that trade was pretty active.    In the oase of Lloyds Bank, during the last twelve months  40,000,000 of fresh loans had been made.    These loans had now been analysed in two columns, BAW for loans to traders who were requiring additional accommodation because of increased activity, and &quot;B&quot; for those requiring help because of lack of flourishing times.    It was found that in the coal and shipbuilding industries, which had notoriously been going through bad times, the Bank had lent considerably more money for purposes of extension, and for purposes which one generally
GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING (Contd..).associated with activity in trade, than for help because of the traders making losses and their struggles to keep on their legs.   He did not want to make too big a point of this, because it was such a curious result,  and so much at variance with onefs ordinary impression of trade at the present time, that it might require some further investigation.MR, TENNANT remarked that a similar analysis by the Westminster-Bank bore out what Mr. Pease had said.SIR FELIX SCHUSTER considered that on the whole, the reports received from the branches of the National Provincial Bank were not unsatisfactory.   The Cotton trade appeared to be in a healthier condition; in the Pottery trade there was now a decrease of unemployment, and Boots and Shoes, Hosiery and Drapery all seemed to be fairly busy. The retail trades seemed indeed to be very prosperous. There was a better feeling as regards China.   As regards the New York rate of exchange, it appeared from that morning&apos;s newspapers that Sterling had improved.   As to banking advances, he thought that a considerable part of the advances were really made to keep people going;    although, it was true, his Bank had had applications for extensions even in the steel and iron industries.THE PRESIDENT said he had been Informed by an American Banker that the prospects in America were extraordinarily good.    As far as they could see,  the barometer was set fair for a period of quite three or four years, with steady and steadily rising trade, and no unemployment-.    If that was1 a reliable forecast, was there yet any reflection here of this state of things,  this great prosperity of a country which imports many luxury articles from us?SIR FELIX SCHUSTER did not think it wae perceivable yet, hut he had had similar reports from the United States. The bankers there certainly spoke of prosperity and large purchasing power,  which must lead to a rise of prices in the States,    Our export trade at the moment was, of course, suffering largely from the French and Italian exchange positions.    It was only a transitory matter;    the internal value of the franc and lira had. not yet come into correspondence with the external value, but that could only be a question of time;    in the end it must right itself. Then we should feel the beneficial effect of&apos; it.There was another observation he would like to make. There existed a strong feeling in the City, which he shared, that the embargo on loan issues to foreigners should be removed.      The bankers felt, he believed,  that the sooner that was done,  the better it would be. for our trade.   If it could be. shown that our export trade was going to benefit, then he thought that probably people would not be disheartened if there was a temporary rise in the Bank Rate, but he did not think it necessarily would be raised.    In any case he was
not one of those who objected of the Bank Rate; he thought what was really happening.to frequent fluctuations they were useful to showMR. BRAND observed that there seemed to be some uncertainty in the money market as to why money had become cheaper during the period when gold was going out of the country.    It was not easy to follow the causes of it, but still the fact remained that money was cheap. It might be of Interest to the Council to know what the German rates v-rere as late as the previous day.    The private discount rate in Germany was about i%% to 8%, that was for what they called &quot;fine bank loans&quot;, but the industry which got an overdraft from a bank had to pay between 12% and 15%.    Money was still very dear there, and all securities still showed a decline.    Even the best securities, bank shares and -so on, showed a declining tendency, presumably due to the great shortage of capital.Speaking as a Director of the Newcastle Electricity Supply Company, Mr. Brand said that less electrical power was being taken by shipbuilding, engineering, iron and steel - all the big trades.    There was  some improvement in the chemical trade, he believed, and it was also reported to him that several foreign enquiries had been received from people who thought of putting up factories in England, one at least of these being for artificial silk.Mr. HOSE desired to support what had been said as to the desirability of issuing foreign loans-   There were many persons,  for Instance in Brazil,  in good trading positions with ample security, who were   desirous of purchasing here in those very trades which were particularly suffering.    They wanted to buy new machinery for their factories;    they could not pay cash for it, but they could pay over a series of not more  than 10 years; some of them asked for 5 years.    The money could not be advanced by the banks, and it seemed worth considering whether,  if a person was going to expend, say,  300,000, of which he would spend  250,000 definitely in machinery in this country,  this was not a strong argument in favour of removing the embargo on foreign loan issues.EXTRACT FROM WESTMINSTER BANK REPORTS ON TRADE TW SE september,   1925 .AGR culture .With some exceptions, the wheat orop has been satisfactory and well up to the average.    winter sown oats were generally reported to be giving a good yield, but spring sown oats were disappointing.    The barley crop was variable, and&apos; in certain districts a considerable quantity had been spoiled by rain;    good malting samples were fetching high prices.CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING  (CWW.)
CONE IDENTICAL.EXTRACT FROM WESTMINSTER BANK REPORTS ON TRADE IN SEPTEMBER, 1925 (ColiTaTyHay was a good crop but the demand was poor.Turnips, swedes and mangolds were generally reported to be a fair average yield.    Potatoes were good, but prices were inclined to fall,   Sugar Beet, an experimental crop at Colchester, promised well, whilst at Andover there was varying success with the small quantities grown.Dairy cows were in good demand and prices were fairly well maintained.   As regards both store and fat cattle, market and prices 7?ere good, but for sheep, prices were lower.    Pigs met with a fair demand, but trade in horses was poor.Maidstone reported a surprisingly good yield of hops, describing the quality as &quot;superb&quot;.    There was an unusual demand for English hops from the Continent and further orders were anticipated from Canada.   Maidstone also experienced a wonderful yield of apples, but prices ruled low,   Poor crops were, hoy/ever, reported in the case of pears, plums and damsons.A fair demand existed for small farms, but farmers complained that efficient labour was difficult to obtain.HOSIERY.-55-          *          * *          -si-          -a:-The silk import duty is said, on the whole, to beproving advantageous to the hosiery industry.LACE.The early autumn is invariably a dull season, so that it is as yet too soon to decide whether the benefits of the recent protective duty have overcome the &quot;dumping&quot; of foreign lace which took place prior to the imposition of the tariff, but novelty laces at Nottingham were selling well and so were artificial silk fabrics, to a less^ extent. Employment at Tiverton was better during September than for some months past, owing to the variety of work now under-taken at the factories.SILK.Tracle at Macclesfield continued to be satisfactory, a very favourable feature being the placing of forward contracts, while the demand for artificial silk is so great that producers are unable to give full delivery of the orders on their books.    The position at Leek showed no signs of improvement and business is described as stagnant. Short time is reported to be general and unemployment on the Increase.
EXTRACT FROM LLOYDS BANK REPORT ON TRADE CONDITIONSIN SEPTEMBER, 19257BOOTS AND SHOES;The general condition is still very quiet, but appears to be showing signs of improvement.GRAIN:Trading in overseas wheat quiet throughout the month. Shipments from United States of America and Canada are smaller, as a result of larger crops in Europe which are estimated at 60 million quarters in excess of last year. Quotations have naturally tended downwards.    There have been heavy arrivals of maize and values have steadily declined.HOSIERY;General trade still on the quiet side, but certain sections are reported much busier than they have been.       . .LEATHER:Tanners still continue quiet.    Fancy leather goods manufacturers are fully employed and sane are   short of hands.LIKEN;In the Fifeshire linen trade there has been a drop in the price of the raw material, and the outlook is regarded more hopefully.SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY.MR, GALLAGHER said that the report he had to submit was not particularly cheerful.    In Scotland the consumer&apos;s trade was very quiet.    They had just passed the figures for the second quarter of the year, and their quarter&apos;s trade was a little over  4,^000,000,    In groceries they showed an increase of just over 3?s.    In the drapery and boot and shoe trades there were slight   decreases, in furniture a slight increase. As compared with the corresponding period of last year there proved to be an increase of just under 3%.    In Scotland the coal trade had not materially Improved even since the subsidy was introduced, whilst in the East of Scotland there was a cognate industry, the shale industry, in which there had been rumours of a complete stoppage, and the mere fact of a rumour was sufficient to. produce a decrease in trade-.    Indeed, all over Scotland the retail Co-operative Societies were not placing their seasonal orders as they used, to do, but were buying short and keeping their stocks down.
SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY (Contd.)As regards the recent fall in the price of oread. Mr. Gallacher thought that this was due very largely to the Pood Council.    Some had thought that the Pood Council, not possessing compulsory powers, would not have any great effect; hut he was glad to say that the publicity it had given to the figures in this case had had a considerable effect in arousing public opinion and enforcing a reduction of price.    He thought the price could be still further reduced.    In Scotland the co-operative societies had done something to help.THE PRESIDENT said he appreciated what Mr. Gallacher had said about the Pood Council, and would like to convey it to them..   UNi&amp;t PLOYMEN T,MR. PHILLIPS said that the number of registered unemployed at the end of September was 1,336,100.   At the end of August last it was 1,354,300 and at the end of last July, 1,197,600.    Thus there was a reduction of 18,200 below the August figure, but an Increase of 138,500 over July, if one compared the end of July and the end of August this year, the only trade which shewed a marked change was the coal trade where the percentage increase was from 14.6 to 22.2,    Comparing the end of September with a year ago the total number of registered unemployed   shewed an increase of 136,800.    That increase was, of course,  sufficiently accounted for by the depression in the coal, trade, which had nearly 280,000 unemployed by the end of August and .292,000 at the end of September last, as compared with 103,000 in September 1924.    Comparing the number of insured persons unemployed at the end of August this year, with the correspond-ing number at the end of August last year., there was found to be an increase of 201,000.    Coal was up by. 182,000, wool by 26,000 and shipbuilding and ship repairing by 9,000.    These increases were offset to a certain extent by a number of relatively small decreases in minor trades.   There was no outstanding decrease In a major trade as compared with a year^ ago, though there were slight decreases in unemployment In engineering (excluding marine engineering), in cotton manufacture and In building.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON stated that In Australia the season generally was good in all the agricultural districts but not so good in the pastoral districts.    The prices for wool and beef and dairy produce were all good at present, and a further experiment was to be made in shipping chilled beef to the United Kingdom during the coming year.
AUSTRALIAN TRADE    (Contd.)As regards the wool clip, between 1st.September and Christmas next 1,040,00ft   bales were to be offered for sale. The clip had been pretty good.The Commonwealth Bank had decided to open &amp; Rural Credits Department to finance farmers and other members of the community who are not easily reached by the Banks; and, further, a statement was noticed in a speech of Mr. Bruce&apos;s to the effect that a considerable amount of money was to be made available for housebuilding.The Tariff rates were under discussion at present, and It perhaps was not generally known in the United Kingdom that any increase of duty took effeot in Australia from the date of the introduction of the Resolution, but any decrease did not come into operation until Parliament had passed the Resolution.There was also a rather Interesting development in regard to the British manufacture of cinema films.     It was proposed to remit all duties on British films and retain 1-ld on the foreign.      In Victoria the Legislative Council had passed a Bill prescribing that picture houses should exhibit at least 1,000 feet of British films in each programme.INDIAN TRADE.MR. LINDSAY stated that the chief interest just now was in the expiring efforts of the monsoon.     The only consistency in the monsoon during the last few years had been its attitude of hostility to the meteorological experts, whose forecasts had been falsified every time.&apos; This year they had prophesied that there would be one of the worst monsoons on record.     All the conditions were unfavourable, and it looked as if the monsoon were going to agree with the forecast by coming to a premature end;   but It revived late in September, and whilst It had not been particularly good;, It wu3 certainly better than had been anticipated end the distribution had been on the whole quite fair and well sustained.The jute forecast was published a few days ago -7,851,000 bale3.     The trade were hoping for 10 millions and would have been glad of 9^ millions;    and they still thought the correct estimate would be between 8,800,000 and 9 million bales, as contrasted with the official forecast Of leas than 8 million.     The first estimates of the new cotton sowings had been received;    they only covered a small proportion of the total area, but showed an Increase of 27 per cent on last year&apos;s figures, which was satisfactory so far as it went.     In regard to wheat, the production this year was likely to be just about equal to the consumption. They would probably have very little free for export. On the. other hind, the better reports on the monsoon would probably relax stocks, so that by the end of the year India&apos;s exports might have exceeded her imports. &apos; On the import side It was.
INDIAN    TRADE.  (Contd,.)curious that the value of India&apos;s imports of foreign goods has been extraordinarily steady for the last three years, between 18 and 20 croreg a month.     The explanation seemed to be that India was buying just the minimum required, and Mr.Lindsay confirmed what Mr. Judson had&apos; said regarding the absence of stocks.     Another change in the piece goods position was that the Indian no longer bought his requlre-ments once a year for the year&apos;s needs.     Now, as he ran out of cotton cloth he bought more, so that the old system under which the bulk of the trade was done in August and September no longer held good.     It was spread over the whole year.In cotton piece goods, pre-war, British imports formed &quot;94^ of the whole, they now amounted to 86/  of the total.     In machinery the British proportion, pre-war, was 88%; it was now &amp;27ou     In iron and steel goods it appeared that, pre-war, British imports accounted for 68%, and from January to July 1925 for 72/ , of the aggregate.But the cotton yarn showed a most ,unf avourcvble turn; whereas we did the great bulk of the trade before the war, viz. about 90%, Japan had now taken a large proportion of this trade.     Our proportion now was 22%; theirs was 77%, In regard to railway plant, there had been some criticism in the press lately in regard to the Government of Indiafs purchases.     The shortage of materials out in India was well known and the Government of India had estimated heavy requirements spread over several years, but those estimates had not been proceeded with, because of the primary necessity of squaring the budget0     There were indications, however, that the purchase of railway plant would be greater during the next   few years.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.Mr, HOSE said that in Chile a progressive step had been taken in the sphere of banking legislation, which had an important bearing upon the exchange and currency position. On the recommendation of the American Commission, which is studying Chilean national finances, and to which he had referred at a previous Council meeting, the President recently signed a Decree authorising the establishment of the Banco Central de Chile.     This, institution would have the sole right to issue currency notes, the present issues being called in; and tho fresh notes would be based upon a new gold par value of 6d. per peso, instead of 18d.as hitherto.     This change should do much to assist trade in general, and more particularly importation, if, as seemed probable, stability in exchange could be maintained at around the new parity, for violent fluctuations in internal prices would be obviated, and importers saved the necessity of insuring against loss by forward purchases of foreign currencies.     As a matter of fact, the anticipations of the fixing of a new parity, combined with improvement in the
general outlook, had already caused the Chilean peso to appreciate in   value over the past few months, and it was now worth 65S2d.      In other respects also there had been improvements recently In the national financial position, and the political outlook was much brighter.The efforts of the Brazilian Government to bring about a recovery in the external value of their currency by sound economic methods had recently borne fruit, the sterling equivalent of the Milreis having risen in the past few weeks to 7-&apos; 7 16d ., the highest level recorded since August, 1922. This appreciation In exchange should naturally tend to bring   about an improvement in the import trade.The latest advices from the agricultural centres in Argentina Indicated that prospects for the forthcoming cereal crops were most promising, and the continuance of this state of affairs would doubtless encourage the purchase of good3 from abroad.     The enquiry for British articles in the hardware market had recently shown signs of increasing, despite competition and price-cutting on the part of German manufacturers.     Conditions in the Textile markets remained dull, but merchants in the clothing trade were anticipating a good season during the coming summer, the visit of the Prince of Wales having resulted in a considerable depletion of stocks.    Little hope was felt, however, of an early improvement in the Manchester trade.TRADE IN CHINA.MR. LAND ALE stated that the trading position in Shanghai and the North of China had improved during the past few weeks, and the Chinese were evidently endeavouring to create a favourable atmosphere for the Tariff Conference, Arrangements had been made to re-start the British Cotton Mills in Shanghai, but negotiations for the re-opening of the auctions of piece goods had not yet been brought to&quot; a satisfactory conclusion,     Private sales of piece goods were increasing.     There was some buying in England due to the prospect of a higher Tariff:.     Sales of machinery, tool steel and railway material were very difficult.In Hongkong and the South of China there wfs very little improvement, and business in Hongkong remained practically at a standstill owing to the attitude of the Soviet Government in Canton, which continued to disregard our Treaties with China,     The Chinese, however, were a trading nation and were not likely to allow the restrlc-tions. Imposed upon them to continue for long.The Canton-Kowloon Railway was still in a deplorable condition, much damage having been done to the station buildings and rolling stock.      In the Shanghai district and the North the railways were working satisfactorily and making good earnings.The export trade from China was in a depressed condition owing to lack of demand from Europe.      The Shipping Strike still continued,     it had been possible, however, to get a few crews, and more ships were working..CONFIDENTIAL. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (Contd)*
