CONFIDENTIAL L1BRAIJY.359[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 469 (25). &apos;1JOMOSUL.Note by Secretaby of State fob the Colonies.THE enclosed extract from a private letter sent on the 28th October by Reuters correspondent in Constantinople to his Chief, Sir Roderick Jones, may be of interest to my colleagues. A letter from the same source was circulated as CP. 431 (25).L. S. A.Downing Street, S.W. 1,November 12, 1925.(Confidential. 1You will be interested in a conversation I had last week with a deputy and two other directors of the Agence Anatolie, Alaeddin and Hidayet Beys. I must first explain that Hidayet is candidate for electoral honours, and that both he and Alaeddin are in constant relations with deputies belonging to the immediate entourage of the Ghazi. Consequently I attach some value to their remarks as reflecting the views of the Ghazi himself.They were returning a call, and Hidayet opened the discussion with : &quot; Why don&apos;t you let us have Mossoul ? that&apos;s the only thing between us and Great Britain.&quot; I said: &quot; Yes, and then you would want Bagdad, Bassorah and the whole of Mesopotamia.&quot; He replied: &quot;We would not take it as a gift. We are done with the Arabs for ever; they are treacherous dogs, and we never wish to have anything to do with them again.&quot; (Here he was voicing Turkish sentiment generally.)I said: &quot; Why all this fuss about Mossoul; it was humbug to say it was a matter of life and death as some of the papers tried to make out.&quot; He replied that it was of course not the little bit of land they were worried about; what they were afraid of was that the Kurds there would be used as a thorn in Turkey&apos;s side. In Turkey they were abolishing tekkes, Sheikhs, turbans and the fez. These measures were undoubtedly unpopular and were causing much discontent, but the discontent would be fostered and converted into open sedition if just across the frontier Kurds were encouraged with &quot; false &quot; ideas of liberty. If their tekkes were supported and their Sheikhs not only maintained but given enhanced authority and honour, they would probably wear turbans of double and treble size. All this would keep the agitation boiling among the Turkish Kurds.I asked why the same should not apply to Persian Kurds, who were more numerous.He said they were different, and had never been intimately related with Turkish Kurds, whereas those of Mossoul were blood-brothers of Turkish Kurds.I suggested that if the Kurds were allowed liberty to appreciate the blessings of the freedom the Turks were thrusting upon them, they would not be influenced by the preservation of feudal customs among their relations across the border.He replied that it took a long time to appreciate new ideas. In conclusion he said : &quot;It looks as though we were not going to be more successful in settling the question, which is doomed to be adjourned and adjourned.&quot;The conversation was conducted very good-humouredly. I felt that if there had been any suspicion of danger of hostilities, any thought of the probability of a rupture at the back of their minds, or of those minds in Angora which they were reflecting, it would have shown itself somewhere. On the contrary, a reference to the French and Syria provoked the remark: &quot; Of course, it is different with Aleppo, Alexandretta and Antiochia.   These we shall never abandon.&quot;[13807]
