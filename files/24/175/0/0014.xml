IIJHli^ H!lll^^ of His Britannic Majesty^ Govemm^f ]Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1925.SECRET. J ^ -                                                                          Copy No.    3()CP. 414 (25;.CABINET.THE MOSUL QUESTION AT  THE LEAGUE  OF  NATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of Stajptor the Colonies.FOR some time before the meeting of the Council to consider the question of the Turco-Iraq frontier it was becoming increasingly evident that the Turks had decided to conduct their case on aggressive and truculent lines. At the end of June a series of preposterous and wholly unfounded complaints were circulated to the members of the Council by the Turkish Government to the effect that persons venturing to express pro-Turkish sympathies before the Frontier Commission had been molested by the British and Iraq authorities; that immediately after the departure of the Commission wholesale reprisals began against those who declared for Turkey; that these persons were pressed to sign manifestos going back on their previous declarations, and that those who refused to do so were imprisoned; and that there had been a series of bombardments by the British Air Force as a reprisal for pro-Turkish demonstrations in the frontier region. At the same time the first steps were taken in an aggressive policy along the present frontier, involving not only the occupation of several villages on the Iraq side of the frontier and the deportation or hurried flight of their inhabitants, but also the systematic clearing out of the Chaldean Christian population of the Goyan region to the north of the frontier. This latter policy was actually put into full effect in the week immediately following the opening of the Session of the Council.It was apparently as a smoke-screen to cover these impending operations that the Turkish Foreign Minister, Dr. Tewfik. Rushdy, opened his Geneva campaign with the request that, before any other business was dealt with, the Council should allow him to draw attention to the serious situation created by an alleged recent series of violations of the Iraq frontier by the Iraq authorities and by the menacing-demonstrations conducted by the Mediterranean Fleet against the coasts of Asia. Minor. These complaints, devoid of any basis of fact or even of inherent credibility,, provided a thoroughly characteristic opening for the new Turkish representative at the first meeting of the Council, which took place on the 3rd September.We had already been warned by Mr. Lindsay, our. Minister at Constantinople,, that the sending of Dr. Tewfik Rushdy was to be regarded as a victory for the extremists as against the more moderate views favoured by Ismet Pasha, and I have since learned from other sources that this wild young man, who studied revolutionary methods under Lenin, came to Geneva determined to convey to the League and the world in general that he was one of those men of destiny whom nothing could ever turn back from a policy he had once decided on, and that the gravest consequences were to be feared if Turkey did not get full satisfaction for her demands. His controversial methods, I was told, consisted of bold assertions and ingenious and plausible arguments produced for immediate effect regardless of subsequent disproof.. I had plenty of opportunity of verifying the accuracy of these descriptions. These qualities were combined with a striking physiognomy, not so much Turkish aS Hittite: a flat forehead, continued by scanty hair brushed straight back, receding so markedly as to make an actual angle with the steeper line of the nose, smoked horn-rimmed spectacles, and a large loose mouth irregularly garnished with brown and gold teeth.Having dealt briefly with the Turkish charges I proceeded to make my opening statement. Knowing that the Turk had been freely hinting in various quarters that he would not regard himself as bound by any decision he disliked, I began by laying special stress on the fact that both parties had formally declared last year that they accepted in advance the decision of the Council. I then disposed of the legal point. [13611] B
2as to the continuance of Turkish sovereignty which the Frontier Commission had, in a rather misleading fashion, included among the political considerations affecting the situation, and which, I notice, has since been used by certain critics at home as implying that the Commission had reported that the &apos;Turkish claim was legally justified. I pointed out that while it might be technically correct to say that the disputed territory was still Turkish, in so far as the formal renunciation of Turkish sovereignty had not yet been completed, it was quite clear that the Turkish Govern-ment, by the Treaty of Lausanne, had bound themselves to renounce sovereignty over whatever part of it lay on the iraq side of the frontier ultimately fixed by the Council. After referring briefly to the work of the Commission and the difficulties which it had necessarily encountered in Iraq, I quoted the conclusion arrived at by the Commissioners that a. plebiscite was impossible, and then proceded to recapitulate, without comment or criticism, the final conclusions in the Report, leading up to the main final conclusion that the balance of the various considerations, particularly those of an economic and geographical character, as well as the wishes of the population as a whole, operated in favour of the continued union with Iraq of the whole territory south of the Brussels line, subject to the continuance for some twenty-five years of &quot; the effective mandate of the League &quot; and to certain concessions to local and racial sentiment in the Kurdish districts.I pointed out that this main recommendation implied a question addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Was that Government prepared to undertake towards the League of Nations to maintain the conditions subject to which the Commission recommended that the whole of the disputed area up to the Brussels line should remain part of Iraq? After drawing a distinction between mandatory control and the treaty relation which was approved last year by the Council of the League, and Avhich was clearly the relation intended in the Commission^ references to the mandate, I pointed out that it was, in my opinion, unwise to lay down definitely in advance the precise period during which the Iraq State could consolidate its position and develop its resources. Subject to these explanations, I said, in accordance with the Cabinet conclusions of the 7th August, that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared, before the expiration in 1928 of the present treaty, to give effect to the provision contained in the protocol of that treaty by replacing it by a treaty of longer duration which would safeguard throughout the kingdom of Iraq those conditions of stable government and reasonable consideration for local interests, subject to which the Commissioners considered that the territory south of the Brussels line should continue in its present union with Iraq; and that they were prepared to continue their responsibility towards the League of Nations in this respect until such time, within the limit of twenty-five years suggested by the Commissioners, as the Council of the League was clearly convinced that those conditions of stability which the Commissioners postulated were definitely and permanently secured. I read out a resolution passed by the Iraq Parliament only two days before, to the effect that the Iraq nation declared its strong friendship for Great Britain and expressed its desire to continue an alliance with her after the expiry of the present treaty. I also gave an assurance that the existing administra-tive system in the Kurdish areas, which does to a large extent carry out the recommendations of the Commission, would be continued and made even more effective.I then dealt at some length, and in strong terms, with the grave objections to the alternative suggestion, which had not, indeed, been recommended by the Com-missioners on their own responsibility, but merely hinted at by them, namely, that the territory south of the Brussels line might be partitioned between Turkey and Iraq. I made it clear in this connection that the League could not expect the British Government or the British taxpayer to make themselves responsible for the military and financial consequences of such a partition which might involve a burden entirely beyond the capacity of Iraq itself. The rest of my statement was taken up by an exposition of the strategical and other arguments for the British case for a slight rectification of the frontier up to the crest of the main mountain range, in which 1 laid special stress on the necessity for ensuring a satisfactory settlement of the Assyrian problem. I also added that I accepted the Commission^ recommendations for special measures to ensure the protection of minorities on the assumptions that the Turkish Government would similarly accept them in Turkish territory, and that the League would be prepared, in spite of the obvious administrative objections, to make an experiment in this direction. I said, in conclusion, that the only concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government was to safeguard both the interests of the populations directly concerned and the development and progress of the young nation for whose
welfare they had, under the League of Nations, made themselves responsible. His Majesty&apos;s Government were convinced that the fulfilment of that responsibility and the attainment of the objects in view could only be adequately ensured by the acceptance of the frontier claim which they had themselves put forward. Any less satisfactorv frontier would present serious disadvantages. I impressed upon the Council the immense importance of arriving at a final solution during the present, session of the Council, and concluded, as I had begun, by repeating the assurance given last year by Lord Parmoor that, whatever decision the Council might come to, His Majesty&apos;s Government would loyally accept it.At the afternoon session on the same day, Dr. Rushdy gabbled through a long and rambling statement, in which he made an ingenious attempt to misrepresent the Commission^ report as generally favourable to the Turkish&apos;&apos; claims, quoting various passages apart from their context and introducing lengthy extracts from the total irrelevant reports submitted to his own Government by the Turkish assessor with the Frontier Commission. He made great play with the conclusions of the Commission regarding legal sovereignty, and rebuked them for exceeding their functions by introducing the issue of the duration of the mandate.On the 4th September, at the morning session, the Turkish representative made a very brief and ineffective reply to my statement of the preceding day, in which the only point worth noting was a refusal to consent to the discussion of the question of the protection of minorities. I then proceeded to deal in detail with his statement of the preceding afternoon. In reply to his suggestion that British claims were continually advancing, and that all that Turkey asked for was security, I laid special stress on the point that it was the Turkish, and not the British, claim which, if accepted, would cause a menace to the peace of the Near East, as it would involve a departure from the existing system set up under the auspices of the League, and the restoration of a now well-governed territory to an alien sovereignty against the wishes and interests of the population. I repeated my previous assurance that Flis Majesty&apos;s Government would accept whatever decision the Council might give, and asked whether the Turkish Delegate could renew on behalf of his Government the similar assurance given to the Council last year by Fethy Bey. Dr. Rushdy, in his brief rejoinder, evaded my question whether he would give any undertaking that the Kurdish elements in the disputed area would, if they were given back to Turkey, be granted a measure of autonomy, such as they enjoyed at present, and he ignored my request for a renewed assurance that Turkey would accept the decision of the Council. I was in some doubt whether to repeat my challenge on this latter point, hut was induced by M. Briand, the President, to say nothing at the moment, as he proposed to draw attention to it himself at the private session, which followed immediately afterwards, and appointed a sub-committee of three members, who were to consider the whole question in detail and report to the Council. As a matter of fact, all that M. Briand did was, at the end of the meeting, in a hurried undertone, to &apos;&apos; remind both parties that they had placed their cause solemnly in the hands of the League of Nations, of which the Council formed a part, and that they were awaiting from the Council that justice which it would endeavour to grant them.&quot;As my colleagues will have seen from the memorandum (CP. 403/25) circulated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated the 9th September, I discussed with him and with Lord Cecil the same evening the desirability of calling the attention of the Secretary-General in an official letter to the silence of the Turkish representative, and of refusing to attend the sub-committee or instructing my advisers to attend it, until I knew what steps the Council proposed to take to secure the necessary explicit assurance from Dr. Rushdy. We decided, for the reasons explained in the memo-randum referred to, to take no action. Next morning we received a report from Berlin that the Turkish Ambassador had addressed a demonstration of Turks outside the Turkish Embassy on the previous day, and had said that Turkey would not recognise any frontier imposed by England or by the League of Nations. In a fuller report, received on the 7th September, it appeared that, in an interview with a correspondent of a German newspaper, he had added that the Turkish people placed their hope in the decision of the League of Nations, but, should their inviolable rights not be recognised there, were determined to have recourse to all possible means for the attainment of their national claims, including, in the last resort, a recourse to armed force. A report was also received from Constantinople on the 7th September to the effect that the declarations of Dr. Rushdy at Geneva were envenoming the situation in Turkey, and that the press was undoubtedly working up the public, including the military class, to a state of excitement. My colleagues will have seen from the memorandum referred to that the position was [13611] B 2
again discussed with Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Cecil on the 9th September. Out&apos; view was that the time had not arrived to attempt to extract a further assurance from the Turkish representative, and that, failing some more definite indication on the part of the Turkish Government that they intended to repudiate the assurance given last year by Fethy Bey, it would not be politic for me to take any further steps m the matter.Meanwhile, the Sub-Committee, consisting of Dr. Unden, M. Quinones de Leon and M. Guani, the Swedish, Spanish and Uruguayan members of the Council, had been holding its preliminary meetings at &quot;which it heard separately the three members of the Frontier Commission. All of them, I understand, impressed upon the Sub-Committee, in far more definite terms than those employed in their Report, the undoubted wish of the majority of the population of the contested territory to remain in Iraq. There would, I believe, have been no difficulty in securing an early report of the Sub-Committee, and consequently also of the Council, in favour of our claim, as far at any rate as the present frontier is concerned, but for the extraordinary position taken up by Dr. Unden, who, owing to M. Branting&apos;s death, had succeeded to the Chairmanship of the Sub-Committee. Dr. Unden, a young-Professor of Law, with bushy eyebrows, great obstinacy, and an abysmal incapacity even to conceive that the conditions of Asia are not exactly the same as those of Europe, appears to have decided from the first that the territory was to be divided along the line of the Lesser Zab. As far as I have been able to gather from his colleagues, and from a memorandum which he circulated to all the Council, except myself  incidentally without any intimation that this was contrary to the views of his colleagues on the Sub-Committee and, indeed, without their knowledge his main ideas may be summed up as follows : The Turks had the country before the war and ought to get back as much of it as possible subject to the state of Iraq being still able to exist; the economic and strategic arguments showing that Iraq could not maintain itself if pushed back to the Lesser Zab line could easily be disposed of by economic and military guarantees (I am informed that he himself suggested the idea, of a Pact to the Turks); the wishes of the population were really unascertainable and not a matter of any consequence; in any event, the business of the Council was to mediate and compromise, and as the English were ready to accept anything and the Turks were threatening trouble unless they got what they wanted, it was necessary to give them a good deal.In the first instance, however, it would seem that Dr. Unden&apos;s method of pro-cedure was to endeavour to alarm his colleagues on the Sub-Committee by suggesting, as a Professor of Law, that the Turkish legal arguments against the competence of the Council to introduce conditions, such as the prolongation of the Treaty relation, in respect of a territory still juridically Turkish, were so serious as to make a clear decision in favour of Iraq impossible, and that it was necessary to give the Turks enough to make them waive their insistence on this aspect of the matter. It was reported to us that M. Guani, a gentle, colourless Uruguayan, had been seriously impressed, and that the Sub-Committee, overriding M. Quinones de Leon, would inevitably recommend the partition of the disputed area unless their doubts on the legal aspect could be allayed. The suggestion was conveyed to us that it might be politic for me, after laying our own legal case before the Sub-Committee, to volunteer to refer the legal questions to the Permanent Court of International Justice, if the Sub-Committee remained in any doubt. After careful and prolonged discussion with Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Cecil, we arrived at the conclusion that, while it would be wise to accept a reference to the Inter-national Court rather than to allow the Sub-Committee to drift into a thoroughly vicious conclusion such as partition, it was not yet sufficiently established that they were in fact going to do this.On the 11th September I attended meetings of the Sub-Committee in the morning and the afternoon, partly to dispose of the misstatements and quibbles contained in a further long memorandum which the Turks had circulated as a somewhat belated rejoinder to my two speeches, partly in order to elucidate further the British claim for a better strategical and administrative frontier and to answer questions on various points, but more particularly to clear up the legal question involved. This was, whether the Council was competent to attach conditions or to take note of declarations made with regard to future policy before fixing a frontier. . On this issue, as well as on the question of the legal sovereignty to which I have already referred, Sir Cecil Hurst, who accompanied me, made a full statement which undoubtedly greatly impressed the Sub-Committee.   I did not at either of these
omeetings make any mention of reference to the Permanent Court of International Justice, but I said that I would be willing if the Sub-Committee, after further study of Sir Cecil Hurst&apos;s statement, still felt that there was any doubt, to do anything in my power to help to remove it. The Sub-Committee knew that this undertaking implied my willingness to agree to a reference to The Hague.Two days of inaction followed, during which I received reports from various sources that the position in the Sub-Committee was becoming increasingly complicated. The Turks had brought forward an unfortunate statement made by Lord Curzon at Lausanne in January 1923, to the effect that a Council decision on the Mosul question would have to be unanimous, and that the Turks might therefore, as temporary members of the Council for the purpose of the dispute, rest assured that no decision could be taken with which they did not themselves agree. The statement was, in fact, inaccurate in its reference to the procedure of the Council under the Covenant and was obviously superseded by the Lausanne Treaty itself, as well as by the definite undertaking of both parties last September to accept in advance the decision of the Council as an arbitrator. It seems, however, to have sufficed to enable Dr. Unden to effect a certain change of front. I now received a verbal message from him that there really was no doubt whatever as to the legal competence of the Council to come to a decision. At the same time, I gathered that M. Quinones de Leon, who throughout has been strongly convinced of the justice of our claim and determined not to be manoeuvred into a false position, was trying very hard to force Dr. Unden to settle first of all and explicitly, in consultation with the Council if necessary, whether the Council was acting as an arbitrator or only as a mediator, in order to avoid the situation which he was evidently endeavouring to keep up in which the Turks were to regard themselves as only dealing with a mediator, and free to reject any solution with which they might not agree, while we were to continue to believe ourselves bound to our pledge to accept the decision of the Council as an arbitrator.Learning on the 14th September that the Sub-Committee were meeting to discuss their doubts and to consider whether they should ask for a private meeting of the Council to resolve them, I thought it essential to help to bring matters to a head. I accordingly addressed a letter to Dr. Unden pointing out that when I made mv original statement to the Council and renewed the assurance that His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted in advance whatever decision might be arrived at, it was on the assumption that the matter had been referred to the Council as an arbitrator whose decision both parties had accepted in advance, and who was entitled to impose any conditions that L; thought fit or to take note of assurances already given. Since both the competence of the Council and the character of the decision to be given had been called in question I felt bound to ask the Sub-Committee whether they could give me a definite assurance that the situation was as I under-stood it to be when I submitted my case to the Council, adding that if the Sub-Committee felt any doubt as to their ability to give such an assurance, I would suggest that an authoritative opinion on both points in doubt should be sought without delay from the Permanent Court of International Justice. I added that it was obviously difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to continue to submit a case without knowing in what capacity it was presenting it, or before what kind of tribunal.This letter seems to have served its purpose in forcing Dr. Undeh&apos;s hand. An informal meeting of the Council was held on the 16th, at which neither I nor the Turkish representative attended. The discussion turned almost entirely on the issue of procedure, though I understand that a very strong speech on the merits was made in our favour by M. Benes, and that the general feeling was in the same direction. It was decided that the issue of legal competence was not really in doubt, but that there was real doubt as to the function of the Council, while a point, of which I had received no previous intimation, was also raised, namely, whether, if the Council was acting as an arbitrator, it still followed its normal procedure under the Covenant, which requires unanimity, apart from the interested parties, or decided like any other panel of arbitrators by a majority. It was accordingly decided that certain questions should be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice, and the Sub-Committee proceeded to draft a report to this effect.On the 19th September the full Council met again and Dr. Unden read the report of the Sub-Committee, which recommended that the following questions should be referred to The Hague Court:  [13611] n 3
(!(1.) What is the character of the decision to be taken by the Council in virtue of article 3, paragraph 2, of the Treaty of Lausanne ? Is it an arbitral award, a recommendation or a simple mediation?(2.) Must the decision be unanimous or may it be taken by a majority? May the representatives of the interested parties take part in the vote ?As soon as the report had been read, I made a statement to the Council in which I said that the postponement which would be involved if the Council accepted the Sub-Committee&apos;s report was from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in itself regrettable; firstly, because they had hoped to get as speedy a decision as possible;   secondly, because any continued uncertainty would naturally involve administrative difficulties; and  thirdly, because of the recent proceedings of the Turkish Government on the frontier.   I pointed out that the first question to be put before the Permanent Court seemed to me to have been settled quite clearly at last year&apos;s meeting of the Council, at which Pethy Bey had agreed with Lord Parmoor&apos;s view that the Treaty of Lausanne placed the Council in the position of an arbitrator whose ultimate award must be accepted in advance by both parties, ft was on this understanding that Lord Parmoor had pledged the British Govern-ment to accept in advance the decision of the Council, and no pledge that he had then given could be binding upon His Majesty&apos;s Government in any other but the same sense, and to exactly the same extent, to which it was binding upon the Turkish Government.   But I agreed that it was essential from the point of view not only of the present submission to the Council, but of future submissions, that its position should be clearly defined, and inasmuch as doubts had been raised on this point I agreed that it should be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice.   I went on to say that doubts had also been raised as to the competence of the Council to take note of assurances given by either party or to impose conditions before settling the frontier.   I assumed that the fact that this question was not one of those which was to be submitted to the Permanent Court implied that there was no doubt in the mind of the Council with regard to it.   I laid stress on this point, insisting that it would obviously be an unsatisfactory position from the point of view of the League itself, as well as of both the Governments concerned, if after the pronouncement of an opinion by the Permanent Court on the questions submitted to it any further doubts could be raised which would give rise to further delay.Dr. Rushdy then came out into the open. After some preliminary flourishes, in which he repeated his categorical denial of the truth of the allegations concerning the deportation of Christians and dwelt on his efforts for peace and conciliation as evidenced by an offer which he apparently made to the Sub-Committee to allow Iraq to retain the Diala district, and supplement that generous concession by the conclusion of a four-Power Security Pact, and on the obstinate disregard by us or all the advances and all the efforts made by the Turks, he came to the business in hand. His view as to the task undertaken by the Council was perfectly clear. He regarded it as a mediating and not an arbitrating body. He based his contention, partly on the difference between the wording of the original draft of article 3 of the Lausanne Treaty, which spoke of a decision of the League, and the final draft which spoke of a reference to the League, partly on Lord Curzohs unlucky state-ment to which I have already referred, and which he declared Turkey regarded as an undertaking given to her by Great Britain before the world. He&apos;added that the Turkish Government saw no necessity for referring anything to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague. The advisory opinion of that organi-sation, as he contemptuously styled it, could not in any way affect the rights held by the Turkish Government under the Treaty of Lausanne, the minutes of the Conference which resulted in that Treaty and the provisions of the Covenant as^ to the powers of the Council. As for any declarations made on behalf of the Turkish Government which might modify those rights, they were worthless in the absence of formal ratification by the Turkish Grand National Assembly.The length of rope given to the Turk had proved sufficient. I was at last able definitely to put an end to the ambiguous position in which we had been ever since the proceedings began, and to make it quite clear to the Council that there could be no further question of measuring our case and that of the Turks by a different measure. I at once drew the attention of the Council to the fact that, unless I had completely misunderstood him, the Turkish representative had informed the Council that whatever might be the view of the Permanent Court he was not prepared to
accept that view unless it concurred with his own, and that he had also formally disavowed the assurance given by Fethy Bey to the Council on the 30th September, 1924. If that was really the meaning of what he had said, then I was bound to make it quite clear that until the statement which he had just made was withdrawn, and until the Turkish Government definitely and explicitly renewed its pledge to accept in advance the decision of the Council, any pledge or assurance that the British Government had given fell to the ground and was non-effective. If the Turkish Government did not find themselves able to come into line again with the British Government, as it did in September last, by the time the Permanent Court had given-its reply, assuming that that reply was to assign more than a mediating role to the Council, then the British Government would of course be in the same position of complete liberty as the Turkish Government. What I should have liked to say was that the Council in that case ought to refuse to allow the Turks to appear before it, or to give any further consideration to their claim. But I felt that, as an interested party, I could not well do more at the moment than firmly assert that we could not be put in a different position from the Turk as regards the character of our obligation.M. Loucheur, who was presiding over the Council in the absence of M. Briand, said that there could be no question of discussing round the Council table the declara-tions made by the two parties. The Council was there to listen, but he need hardly say that its silence did not in any way imply acquiescence in these declarations. The Council intended to stand on the legal ground of the Treaty of Lausanne, and it was for that very reason that the Sub-Committee had proposed an appeal to the high competence of the Permanent Court in order to settle certain questions of law. The Council then adopted the conclusions of the Committee, and M. Loucheur wound up the session by reminding both parties of their undertaking to preserve the status quo until a decision had been reached on the subject of the frontier.I understand that a Special Session of the Permanent Court is to be held on the 26th October and that the decision will be given about the 22nd November, in time at any rate for it to reach all concerned before the December meeting of the Council. We shall then be confronted by one of several alternatives. The Court may conceivably disregard the obvious purpose of the Treaty of Lausanne and the assurances given last September by both parties and declare the function of the Council to be a purely mediatory one. In that case we may safely presume that the Turks will accept nothing that we could possibly consider and things will simply continue in statu quo. If, on the other hand, the Court decides that the Council is an arbitrator, the first step will obviously be to insist on the Council securing from Turkey an absolute and unqualified pledge to accept the decision of the Council in advance. The Turks will probably refuse. In that case the Council can either declare them non-suited and give a verdict in our favour, or postpone the considera-tion of the case until the Turks come forward of their own accord and announce their readiness to accept a decision, in other words postpone it indefinitely. If the Turks should, however, completely change their attitude by December and accept, we have the alternative possibilities of a majority decision which would certainly be in our favour, and of a unanimous decision. The latter may be so difficult to secure in face of Dr. Undeh&apos;s attitude that great efforts will undoubtedly be made, in that case, to avert the discredit to the League of a failure to arrive at a decision, and we shall be strongly pressed to find some partial concession or face-saving formula which may bring Dr. Unden into line. That may yet have to be considered, but on.the whole I am disposed to think that the point will not be reached, but that we shall either secure a favourable verdict or that the whole question will continue to remain in statu quo. As we are in possession this last solution, though not ideal, is good enough to work upon, unless the Turks really mean to declare war and invade Iraq. I do not believe that they are really capable of such an act of suicidal folly, however much they may have bluffed for the benefit of the League and of our cowardly press magnates at home.The Turkish tactics in this business have, indeed, been based on a bluff which has failed to produce its effect, and which it will be much more difficult to renew successfully three months hence. They have been fundamentally stupid tactics, for they have been throughout calculated to frustrate a decision, a result which can only benefit the party actually in possession. At the same time the instinct which has. inspired them may well lead the Turkish Government to prefer to keep their claim to the whole Mosul Vilayet alive vis-a-vis their own Grand National Assembly, even if they know that they do not mean to do anything to assert it, rather than to
acquiesce in a formal acceptance, in advance of a decision of the Council of the League, which they suspect will give them little or nothing.Administratively, of course, the continuation of a period of delay and uncertainty is regrettable, especially if it is accompanied by a series of irritating minor acts of aggression along the frontier. In this respect, however, the Turks have made the position more difficult for themselves by choosing the actual time of the Council Meeting for a display of their attitude which has enabled us to secure the presence of a League Representative on the frontier and which has, once again, advertised their unfitness to he entrusted with control over a subject Christian population.Qn the 12th and 14th September telegram^ arrived from Sir Henry Dobbs that the Turks were attacking Christian villages immediately north of the Brussels line, that 260 Christian refugees had arrived at Zakho in a deplorable state of destitution, and that according to them the Turks were deporting all Christians from the Goyan district into the mountains north qf the line claimed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The total number of these Christians, who are Roman Catholic Chaldeans and not Assyrians, is about 8,000, of whom it would appear from subsequent telegrams that less than half have been actually deported, the rest having made good their escape into Iraq. He also reported that a small Turkish patrol had crossed the Brussels line and had come into contact with an Iraq army patrol; shots had been exchanged and the Turkish patrol had recrossed the line. I decided that this fresh information, which indicated a renewal of the deliberate policy adopted by the Turkish Govern-ment at the time of the Brussels meeting last year, could not be allowed to pass unnoticed. I accordingly informed the Council on the 15th September in an official letter addressed to the Secretary-General. Dr. Rushdy replied on the following day, promising to communicate with his Government and criticising the reports as extremely improbable. His rejoinder was to a large extent counteracted by two telegrams of appeal for help and justice from the refugees themselves, which were addressed direct to the Council on the 16th September. On the 17th September I replied in detail to the Turkish letter, and communicated to the Council the contents of two further telegrams received from the High Commissioner. On the same day Dr. Rushdy in a curt letter to the Secretary-General said that he had received-instructions from his Government, and that he was authorised to inform the Council that the allegations of the deportation of Christians in any part of Turkey were absolutely devoid of foundation.On the evening of the same day I addressed another letter to the Secretary-General, giving further detailed information as to the deportation and ill-treatmenL of Christians, and on the 21st September I asked for a special meeting of the Council to be held with the least possible delay in order to consider the correspondence ending with this letter. I suggested in the letter itself that the Council should forthwith despatch to the locality of the Brussels line such representative or representatives as might be required for the purpose of investigating, so far as possible, the charges which bad. already been made by the two Governments, and of reporting immediately to the Council in the event of any similar occurrence in the future. I added an. assurance that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Iraq Government would welcome the presence of such a representative on their side of the Brussels line and would afford turn every assistance.The Council was undoubtedly impressed by the facts presented to them, and at a meeting held on the 24th September presented a report and resolution laying stress on the necessity of avoiding frontier incidents and the spreading of unverifiable allegations pending the reference to The Hague Court, and recommending the appointment of a representative to keep the Council informed of the situation in the locality of the provisional frontier. The resolution did not specifically include any reference to the charges I had brought forward, but I accepted it without criticism, feeling that the essential thing was to get a man on the spot who could not help reporting some of the events of the last few weeks. Dr. Rushdy had originally refused to accept such a representative, or even to attend the Council. But the personal persuasion of M. Loucheur appears to have succeeded in inducing him to make, at any rate, a pretence of not directly defying the Council. In an even more involved speech than usual, he began by accepting the appointment of a representa-tive, stipulating, however, that he should have a Turkish assessor, and that he should enquire &quot;&quot;from the military and all other points of view&quot; into the situation at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Lausanne and into all infractions of the status quo since July 1923.   I thought at first that he was merely adding these
yconditions to waste time and confuse the immediate issue by bringing forward a mass of charges difficult to deal with after such a lapse of time. But I realised, as he went on to enter upon a long disquisition to the effect that the territory north of the Brussels line was not &quot;disputed territory,&quot; and that any question of deportations could only be a minorities question, that he really meant to refuse any investigation on the Turkish side of the frontier, but was in the same breath impudently trying to introduce stipulations into the conduct of any enquiry on our side of the frontier. His efforts to avoid acknowledging this frankly in answer to questions I put to him were so lamentably shuffling as to lead to a general outburst of laughter in the hall. M. Loucheur, who was in the chair, was very much perturbed, and hurriedly closured the discussion.M. Loucheur spoke to the Turks as the meeting broke up, and came back to me to say that Dr. Rushdy had not really meant to refuse investigation on his side of the frontier outright, but would telegraph for further instructions to Angora. He urged me to stay for another two days in case the answer was conciliatory and justified a further Council meeting. However, in spite of further discussion with Dr. Rushdy, and a lunch with him on the following day, M. Loucheur failed to do more than to draw from Dr. Rushdy before his departure a further letter containing a number of additional stipulations for the conduct of an enquiry south of the frontier, but clearly excluding the Turkish side of the frontier from its purview. In view of this, and of the fact that the Council intended to proceed to the selection of a representative on Monday, the 28th September, I sent a letter to the Secretary-General on the 26th September, just before my departure from Geneva, making it clear that, as long as the enquiry was confined to the Iraq side of the frontier, the details of its conduct were matters to be settled purely between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Council, and that, even if the Turkish Government should change its mind and agree to the conduct of investigations on the Turkish side, there could be no question of a roving investigation into the past and present administra-tion of the Mosul Vilayet, or of anything but an enquiry into the position on the frontier conducted on precisely the same methods and principles on both sides of the frontier and over corresponding areas.I understand that the Council at its meeting yesterday selected as its chief repre-sentative General Laidoner, the Esthonian Commander-in-Chief, a distinguished soldier, who has had experience of warfare on the Armenian front, and who can be relied upon to act with firmness and impartiality.L. S. AMERY.Downing Street, September 30, 1925.o
