THIS DOOUMtStlT lb THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. S3JRET CABINET.StpTOTi (25) ^SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. PROPOSED DUTY ON PACKING AND WRAPPING PAPER. Memorandum &quot;by the Presidsnt of the Board of Trade.The Committee recommend that a duty of 17-1% ad val. be imposed on(A) Packing and Wrapping Paper (including Tissue paper)weighing more than 10 lbs. to the ream of 480 sheets double orcwn, other than vegetable parchment, glazed transparent and grease-proof papers; and(B) Packing and Wrapping Paper as above defined containedin articles made wholly cV partly of such paper where the cost of such paper exceeds 15% of the0value of the manufactured article of which it is a component, such articles to be specified from time to time by executive order. The proposal in respect of (A) appears to be a practicable one administratively.As regards (B) the purpose of the recommendation is to place the British makers of the articles in question on.the same footing in the home market at any rate as the foreign makers thereof, with the added reason in the case of such articles as Paper Bags and Envelopes of the kinds made of Wrapping and Packing Paper, where the paper represents a large proportion of the cost, that without such duty the importation of Paper Bags and Envelopes might be substituted for the importation of the material.I should like to give effect to the second recommendation of the Committee, but in the form suggested it gives rise to both administrative and political difficulties.
] - 502(1) Any proposal to give the Board of Trade the authority suggested by the Commit tee--would probably meet with considerable opposition and give rise to a demand -that the articles be scheduled to the Bill.   This would be impracticable without a detailed, investigation,  if the list were to be exhaustive.(2) A modification of the proposal is the inclusion of only a limited number of articles, such as Paper Bags and Paper Envelopes (which between them are stated to represent some 70,000 tons out of an estimated importation of 90,000 tons of Packing and Wrapping Paper used for further manu-factures) Paper Twine, paper Floor Coverings, Labels, Paper Tubes, Gummed Tape, Stay Papers and Toilet paper/   The list so embodied in a Bill would not cover all the using industries which the Committee seem to have had in mindj but it would oertainly cover a very large proportion of the goods made or partly made from imported foreign papers,   It might be necessary to promise that if experience showed that any other industries were bair^ adversely affected further consideration would be given to them with a view to their inclusion in any subsequent Bill*I am strongly in favour of the second course.In order to avoid difficulties   and delays in Customs administration and minute calculations, I propose that we should adopt the following course(a) a duty of 17-jj$ ad valorem on packing and wrapping.paper as defined by the Committee, excluding articles made of or containing wrapping paper;(b) a duty of 10% ad valorem on the limited list givenin (2) above, when made from wrapping or packing paper of any weight.(Itlld.)    P. C-L.Board of Trade,23rd November.  192 5.
