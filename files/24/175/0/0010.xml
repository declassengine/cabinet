secret cabinet. POOJf   LAW   SSffORM.Copy No-3 00-2.410 (25)Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I append, for the information of my colleagues,a memorandum showing the lines upon which it is proposed that my Department shall open negotiations with persons prominent in the field of local government for the promotion of a scheme of poor law reform.one particular carry out the Cabinet direction of the 13thtMay last (Cabinet 25(25)1 c) but proceeds on the basis of a transfer of all Guardians&apos; functions and institutions to the County and County Borough councils, leaving to County Councils power to delegate to minor authorities only such transferred functions as are covered by services already administered by those authorities,     in this respeot the memorandum follows the recommendation of the Valuation Eating and poor Law Reform Committee reached on the 16th of June, and the authority of my colleagues is asked for the opening of negotiations on the lines now proposed a     The ground for the departure from the earlier Cabinet decision is that it is desired to combine with the scheme of Poor Law peform a scheme of financial reform based on the transfer of all Guardians&apos; functions to county councils, with the proposed limited powers of delegation only.I would also draw the attention of my colleagues to the proposed limitation of the power of granting poor law relief in the case of able-bodied persons.       TheIt will be seen that the memorandum does not in
0 I3?he proposal now made is of course provisional and subject to discussion, but It iB in my view essential that any measure of poor law reform should Include some provision to restrict the present supplementation of unemployment benefit by poor law relief to cases of exceptional hardship, e.g, sickness or very large families, to be specified in the Statute, and to put an end to the grant (which in some areas is becoming automatio) of poor law relief to make up for the loss of unemployment benefit, where benefit is refused on such a ground as that the claimant is not genuinely seeking work.In view of the date which has now been reached and of the urgency of opening negotiations if a poor law reform Bill is to be issued in draft in the Autumn and introduced into parliament next year, it is not proposed to suggest to those who are consulted by my Department that any question of an increase in the total amount of grants is involved in the introduction of the proposed finanoial reform.     They will be consulted on the advantage of a simple change of the system of grant, and on the ohanges in organisation proposed,,(Intd)Ministry of Health,25th September, 1925
POOR-LAW REFORM^ &quot; &quot; &apos;The objects which It is sought to attain by the present proposals are briefly (and apart from the reduction in the number of local elections and local administrative bodies).(1) $he co-ordination and improvement of the provision made for the treatment of ill health, both institutionally and otherwise, and the Inclusion in this provision of all public assistance required as the result of sickness, accident and infirmity.In county boroughs a complete unification of the health services can be secured, and as regards administrative counties there Is contemplated a concentration in the county council of a general responsibility for the administration of health services in the hands of borough end district councils acting within the county.(2) The co-ordination of all forms of public assistance including the relations between poor law relief and unemployment benefit.(3) The decentralisation of the responsibility at present falling on the Minister.(4) The simplification of the financial relations between the Ministry and the local authorities and the freeing of the local authorities from the financial restrictions In matters of comparative detail which are &amp; necessary concomitant of the present system,(5) The correction of oertain anomalies of historic origin such as the association of the registration service (births, deaths, and marriages) with the provision for the relief of the poor.It
DepartmentalIt is not proposed to revise and restate the existing powers of Boards of Guardians in the Reform Bill Theobjections to this course ere that the Bill would be overloaded, and that it is anticipated that experience Of a reformed scheme may at an early date require a further revision, in which these powers and the existing powers of the local authorities can be restated and expanded.     With the exception of the registration service (births, deaths and marriages), which it is proposed to transfer to the Electoral Registration Officers, it is proposed that subject to one modification the whole functions of the Guardians as they now exist shall be assigned to the County and County Borough Councils.     The proposed modification is directed to the better correlation of poor relief and unemployment benefit, and is that, except in prescribed circumstances such as the presence of ill-health, or the necessity to pay a high rent, it shall be declared Illegal to grant (a) out-door relief In supplementation of unemployment benefit, (b) unconditional out-door relief (i.e. relief in respect of which no work test is required) to insured persons who arerefused benefit, or (o) relief to able-bodied persona at a rate exceeding the rate of benefit.It is further proposed to abolish the present system of assigned revenue grants and to replace the existing grants made out of the assigned revenues for poor relief, health services and unallocated, and the grants in aid of expenditure on health sfirvices by a S7/stem of block grants, to be expended in the discretion of the local authority (i.e, the county or county borough council) subject only to the provision of a generally satisfactory health service.     The necessity of
Departmental, approvals of particular Items of expenditure will disappear and the responsibility for proper administration will rest with the local authority to whom, it Is suggested, It properly belongs.     The application of this principle will entail some modification of the present provisions requiring poor law matters to be referred to the Central Authority. It is not proposed to interfere with the present arrangements governing the raising of loans by local authorities.As regards the County F^rougbs no substantial difficulty should arise in the allocation of the transferred duties to existing or new Committees of the Councils in such a way as to produce the greatest possible measure of co-ordination with existing services vjtfcinthe Borough, and it is proposed that, subject to the general preservation of a reasonable standard cf administration, the Councils should have complete freedom in this matter.     It is recognised that in some cases the membership of the Council may require to be increased by co-option or otherwise to cope with the duties transferred to them.As regards the County Councils the problem of administration is complicated (a) by the sise of the areas involved and (b) by the present existence in every part of the administrative counties of two authorities (the County Council and a borough or district council) each of which hay functions in regard to health to perform.     It is proposed that tve. County Council shall in all cases ds.definitely undertake for the whole administrative codnty,(a)
b b(a) a general oversight of the administration of allhealth services, whether existing or transferred, and a duty of acting in the place of a borough or district council declared to be in default in any of those services, and(b) complete responsibility for (i) the considerationof applications for relief and the grant of out-door relief (or Home Assistance) (including-domiciliary medical relief) and (ii) all Institutions transferred under the Reform scheme and the uses to which those institutions are put. The execution of the transferred duties may be assigned to appropriate exist ing**or new Committees of the Council, and those committees, while retaining their responsibility to the Council, may be assisted by local committees manned by members of the Council, or partly by members of the Council and partly by other persons, who would ordinarily be representatives of the borough and district councils in the localities.In cases in which a transferred service is the same in kind as a service already administered by a borough or district council, the transferred service may, with the concurrence of the borough or district council, be actually delegated to the Council.     In such a case the net cost of the service would be raised by the council acting as delegates, but that  council would be exempt from any contribution to the cost of that service in the rest of the county.In some counties it may be convenient to adopt different systems for different parts of the county - it will be for the authorities to consider this matter and to make proposals.As
As an example of the services which may be delegated, there may be cited the eduoatlon of poor law children, which might be undertaken by a borough or district oouncil which is a local education authority. The actual maintenance of children in institutions, not being covered by any service undertaken by a local education authority, must remain a function of the county council, assisted if desirable by a local sub-committee of that council.It will be seen that the scheme aims at securing the greatest possible measure of elasticity and adaptability to local conditions compatible with its main objects, and it is hoped that the county councils will have no difficulty in framing arrangements which will be accepted by the other local authorities in the counties.     The arrangements proposed by each council are to be submitted to the Minister for confirmation in the form of a scheme, and it would rest with the Minister, in considering the schemes submitted to him, to determine any cases of disagreement that may arise.It is also proposed that the Unemployed Workmen Act, 1905, should be repealed.     The Act 13 now largely obsolete as a result of the institution of Employment Exchanges, and the adoption of a system of direct grants for relief works undertaken by local authorities.It should be added that the recent trend of medical science towards specialization and the use of hospitals will necessitate a large measure of co-operation, in many instances, between the County and Countv Borough Councils if reasonable economy is to bemaintained
maintained in the administration of the personal health services.A brief note of the heads of the present proposals is appended.
