CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty?s Government.]   ^ g printed for the Cabinet.   October 1925.SECEET.Copy No.CP. 434 (25).CABINET.EAST AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT LOAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE report of the East Africa Commission was published as a Parliamentary Paper in May of this year, and on several occasions before Parliament rose for the recess we have been asked questions regarding the policy of the Government in regard to its principal recommendations. The main recommendation of the Commission is summarised by them on page 182 of their report as follows : &quot; It will be gathered from our report that, in our opinion, the further economic development of both native and non-native production in East Africa is dependent on the early provision of increased transport facilities and, in particular, on new railway construction.&quot; The outstanding problem is the finance of such undertakings. It is clear to us that, unless the Imperial Government is prepared to assist liberally in this matter, little or nothing can be done.&quot; We accordingly recommend for consideration an East African Transport Loan Guarantee Bill.&quot; Such a Bill, to prove effective, should authorise the issue of a loan for  10 million, guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Imperial Govern-ment and ranking as a Trustee security.&quot; The money obtained by the issue of this loan should be advanced, at the discretion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on projects for railway extension, harbour developments, the construction of main roads and mechanical transport in East Africa. In our opinion, the greater part of the proposals for new construction and for the development of those services recommended in this report will be covered by this amount.&quot; The arrangement should contemplate that during the construction period, which we may put as being the first five years, the interest would be payable by the Imperial Exchequer. After the first five years when, in addition to the interest, the sinking fund will begin to operate, the charges of the loan will fall on the transport services in the first instance, or, failing sufficient from this source, out of the revenues of the various East African territories. Ten years from the date of issue the East African transport systems and territories could begin to repay in addition the amount advanced by way of interest from the Imperial Exchequer during the first five years.&quot; We recognise that such a plan makes some demand on the British tax-payer for the initial period of the service of the loan. We feel that such a demand can be justified if only on the grounds of the moral obligation imposed on Great Britain for the development of its great tropical possessions. But we maintain that the indirect benefits of increased trade and production within the Empire will more than counterbalance any initial sacrifice. Further, approximately half of the capital sum would be spent in Great Britain on rails, bridging material, rolling-stock, &amp;c, which at this time would provide work for the engineering industries of Great Britain and so lessen unemployment charges. Accordingly, the plan which we suggest can be justified also as a business proposition, which will redound not merely to the credit, but also to the economic advantage of Great Britain.&quot;[13683] B
The proposed loan for transport development in East Africa has been the subject of a special interim report of Sir Arthur Balfour3s Committee on Trade and Industry (Cmd. 2463), and in July last I received a deputation largely composed of representatives of the cotton industry in Manchester, who earnestly urged the approval by the Government of the Commission^ proposals.I consider, therefore, that the Government should come to a decision before Parliament meets as to whether they are prepared to accept or reject the recommendations.It would be necessary to introduce a Bill giving power to raise a special loan of 10 millions for transport development in East Africa, mainly for Tanganyika Territory and Uganda. It is not suggested, nor is it contemplated, that the whole of this loan would be required at the same time; in fact, it is unlikely that any portion of the capital expenditure contemplated in the case of Uganda would take place before. 1928, as Uganda is at present engaged upon the expenditure of its share of the 3$ millions advanced in cash by the Imperial Government in March 1924, railway construction on the existing programme having commenced on the 1st January, 1925, the main extension to be completed in 1927. The Governor of Tanganyika Territory estimates his requirements for next year (1926-27) for purposes of railway construction and extension at  1,035,500 (including a deficit of  52,000 on sanctioned construction this year), and also about  300,000 for capital improvements to existing railway and harbour works.I therefore suggest that the Bill should be of a permissive character authorising the issue of the 10 million loan in convenient instalments, arrangements being made to finance the requirements during the intervals by temporary borrowing through the Crown Agents.   The object of this plan is threefold : 1. To avoid making demands upon the annual revenue of Great Britain for capital expenditure on Imperial development; 2. To avoid large sums of money being paid over to the credit of the Coloniesbefore the money is actually required; and 3. To secure a continuous programme of transport development to be laid downover a period of years.I feel the time has come when some better system than periodic cash advances by the British taxpayer should be evolved, and that in the case of these undeveloped parts of the Empire loans should be raised on the cheapest terms for the financing of capital works, Prom the information at present available, it appears probable that if the capital requirements of Tanganyika are met from a loan, no loan-grant from Imperial funds will be required in 1926-27. The grants for the current year and last year were  350,000.There are few portions of the Empire that offer safer or more profitable fields for such investment than our East African territories. Their development lies entirely in the field of the production of raw materials, notably cotton, which are urgently needed by British manufacturers, while every pound of tropical produce grown in these territories increases the purchasing power of their inhabitants for British manufactured goods in return.The latest figures may be of interest as showing the character of the development that is already taking place : Trade of Kenya and Uganda (Trade imports plus domestic exports)   1923 ... ... ... ... 8,250,000    &apos;1924 ... ....... ... 12,315,000First six months, 1924        ... ... 5,800,000First six months, 1925        ... ... 7,820,000Corresponding figures for Tanganyika territory :   1923 ... ... ... ... 3,120,0001924 ... ... ... ... 4,500,000First six months, 1924        ... ... 1,900,009First six months, 1925        ... ... 2,520,000The figures for the working of the Uganda Railway system (including lake and river transport in Uganda, as well as railways in Kenya) for 1924 :  Receipts       ... ... ... ...      1,635,000Expenditure ... ... ... ... 878,000
The Tanganyika Railways for the same year earned  319,000 against an expenditure of  359,000, there being a small profit on the Central line, but a deficit on the line from Tanga to Moshi.The statement of public finance is as follows : There was a floating debt of  190,844 at the end of 1923, but this has been turned into a surplus balance of  59,210 at the end of 1924.The surplus balance standing to the credit of Uganda reached  1,000,000 in the middle of August this year.Tanganyika territory the ordinary budget (exclusive of railway receipts and railway and capital expenditure) was represented for the year 1924 by an actual revenue of  1,240,000; actual expenditure of  1,000,000.The principal public works suggested by the East Africa Commission to be paid for out of the contemplated 10 million loan may be enumerated as follows : (A.) Tanganyika Territory.1. A railway from Tabora to Mwanza (260 miles). This has been sanctioned by the Treasury as far as Shinyanga (mile 120). If the whole line is sanctioned, the expenditure in 1926-27 is estimated at about  780,000.2. A line from Dodoma on the Central Railway northwards through Kondoa-Irangi to Arusha, and an extension from the present terminus in the neighbourhood of Moshi to meet it at Arusha; total, 220 miles. The Governor estimates an expenditure next year on the Moshi-Arusha Section, if sanctioned, of  250,000.3. A branch from the Central Tanganyika Railway south-westward to Lake Nyasa. On information obtained by the General Manager of the Railway from German pre-war sources it appeared that the most promising route for this railway was from Ngerengere, some 80 miles west of Dar-es-Salaam, to Manda on Lake Nyasa (about 400 miles in all), but I have since received information that largely owing to the devastation of war and the spread of tsetse fly a great deal of country which would be traversed by this line is now very scantily populated, and that it is now necessary to consider an alternative route through a more populated country from Dodoma via Iringa and Tukuyu to a point on the northern end of Lake Nyasa at or near Karonga. A further advantage of this alternative lies in the possibility of extending this railway through North-Eastern Rhodesia to Broken Hill on the existing line from the Victoria Falls to Belgian Congo. No expenditure except on survey would be required in 1926-27.(B.) Uganda.The line now being constructed out of the money advanced by Parliament last year provides for a railway from Turbo in Kenya (Uasin Gishu extension) to Mbulumuti and for a branch line from Tororo, where this new line enters Uganda, northward to Mbale. The Commission recommend that as soon as this is completed the construction should proceed in a north-westerly direction from Mbale through the rich cotton-growing areas of Soroti and Lira to the navigable basin of Lake Albert, which includes the stretch of the Nile from the north end of Lake Albert to the Sudan frontier. The funds available from last year&apos;s loan may be sufficient for construction for 35 miles beyond Mbale, to the neighbourhood of lvumi. From thence to Lira would be about 95 miles. It is impossible at present to suggest what route should be followed to the Nile, but the further distance would be roughly 120 miles.(C.) Kenya.The Commissioners do not recommend any further railway construction in Kenya Colony at present, but envisaged the great necessity of proceeding at once to&apos; further harbour works at Mombasa (Kilindini) to deal with the growing traffic of the Uganda Railway. Since the publication of their report, I have had abundant, evidence that the two deep-water berths now being constructed at Kilindini, whichKenya 1924- 2,111,564 1,861,510Actual revenue Actual expenditureUganda 1924-Actual revenue Actual expenditure 1,239,789 918,662[13683]b 2
were authorised by Mr. Churchill when Secretary of State for the Colonies, will prove inadequate, and that at least two more berths, costing possibly  600,000, will be required forthwith. I must, however, await the views of the new Governor before coming to a definite decision on this point.(D.) Nyasaland.The existing railways in Nyasaland are privately owned, and the line connecting that Protectorate with the sea runs through Portuguese territory. The conditions here are exceptional, and I am not in a position to make any definite proposals as to expenditure from the lo&amp;ii.It has been strongly urged from influential quarters that a certain proportion of the amount raised by the loan should be set aside for capital expenditure on purposes other than those connected with the improvement of communications, such as scientific research, sanitation and education. These are all essential for develop-ment in the full sense of that expression, and the Report of the East Africa Commission calls attention to the&apos;urgent necessity of increased expenditure on these services. I would therefore recommend for favourable consideration that of the total amount authorised, the proportion of, say, 5 per cent, should be devoted to the capital expenditure required for improvements in the equipment of the scientific, medical and sanitary and educational services of the East African Dependencies.Neither of the territories in which railway construction is proposed by the Commission can raise public loans under the Colonial Stock Acts, and therefore any loan will require the guarantee of the Imperial Government authorised by an A.ct of Parliament. This is the course which has been taken in the case of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.Further, as other claims on the Dependencies concerned may make it difficult for them to meet the interest charges during the period of construction before the new railways begin to earn revenue, it is suggested by the Commissioners that the interest should be advanced by the&apos;Treasury during the period of five years from the date of issue of the loan. As the whole of the loan would not be issued at once this five-year period would commence from different dates. I hope, however, that the dependencies may be able to meet the interest charges from the outset, and that it may not be necessary to ask for any assistance from Imperial funds on this account. Alternatively, these interest charges might be met out of capital, the amounts of the loan instalments being increased for the purpose.I contemplate that the only construction recommended by the Commission which could be commenced in these territories during the year 1926 will be the completion and equipment of the line from Tabora to Mwanza and the extension from the neighbourhood of Moshi to Arusha. In the following year the line from Dodoma could be constructed as far as Kondoa-Irangi, and the commencement made with the line to meet it southward from Arusha. Economic and engineering surveys could be made next year (1926) for the proposed extension in Uganda, so that the work could commence on the 1st January, 1928, perhaps earlier. A. similar time and date can be envisaged for the line southward from the Central Tanganyika Railway to Lake Nyasa.As to the economic results that will follow from the construction of these lines, all one can say is that the same results can be confidently expected, as have been achieved by the construction of existing railways in East and West Tropical Africa. They will enable the cotton production of British Africa to be increased very largely; the southern Tanganyika highlands will be opened up, with the resulting crops of high-priced coffee, tea and maize. Nyasaland is one of the most valuable potential tobacco-growing countries in the Empire.I support the proposals of the East Africa Commission not only on account of the necessity for making good our pledges to the electors to promote Imperial development and the building up of new markets, but also on the grounds of both the direct and indirect help it will give to the solution of our domestic unemployment problem. In the case of railway construction, in Tropical Africa roughly 50 per cent, of the total capital expenditure represents orders for rails, steel bridging, locomotives, rolling-stock and station equipment in this country. In the case of harbour works the proportion is lower, about 25 per cent, representing material imported for the purpose of the work and 75 per cent. salaries and wages
payable on the spot. Of these salaries and wages, however, a considerable part comes back to this country in the purchase of British goods of all kinds.The indirect benefit to which I attach great importance lies in the expansion of purchasing power which follows the opening up of Tropical countries by means of railways.There is one political point which should not be overlooked in connection with East African development, and that is, our special duty and opportunity in the case of Tanganyika Territory. In Tanganyika we have been entrusted with the development of Germany&apos;s largest and richest former colony, and we have to show to the world that we are not less zealous for its development than we are in the case of our own colonies or protectorates. It is the largest and most populous of all the East African territories, and it lies centrally between the three great lakes of Continental Africa (Victoria Nyanza, Tanganyika and Nyasa) all of which it touches. The railway communications in this territory are now no better than they were in 1914.The East Africa Commission point out that at present Kenya alone of the East African Territories can raise a public loan ranking as a trustee security, by reason of the fact that the Colonial Stock Acts provide only for territories having the status of &quot; Colonies.&quot; They suggest in their report that the Acts be amended by adding the words &quot;protectorates and mandated Territories&quot; to &quot;Colonies.&quot; It certainly seems rather absurd on the face of it that Kenya can raise a loan while Uganda should at present be unable to do so, except on less favourable terms.The amendment of the Acts, however, is a matter which involves considerations in which other Departments of State are concerned. Apart from the Treasury, the Board of Trade would have to be consulted in view of the effect of the amendment in widening the area of Trustee investments. The position of the Indian Protected States may also require careful consideration. I would therefore prefer to proceed as proposed above by way of Imperial guarantee, and to reserve the question of amending the Colonial Stock Acts for further examination by the Departments concerned, with a view to possible legislation next year.L.
