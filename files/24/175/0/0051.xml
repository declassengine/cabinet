A^MFJDENTjAL LIBRARY.  4 3G docuraent is the property of His Britairihito&quot;Majesty1 s Government&quot;. JCABXITET.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. POLICE PBITSIOJTS BILL,   1925. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.This Bill is intended to serve two purposes,  namely, -Clause. 1 to implement the agreement arrived at under the auspices of the Lee Committee and already adopted by the Government, by increasing from 2-3;- per cent, to 5 per cent, the statutory rateable deductions from Police pay towards the cost of pensions. Clause; 2. to give effect to the recommendation of theMackenzie Committee  (the Committee on the claims of the Police and Prison Officers who were dismissed as a result of the strike of 19x9) that Police Authorities should be enabled to apply for the benefit of the wives  (or widows) and children of the strikers the rateable deductions made from their pay during their service. Clause 1 does not appear to call for any further explanations    but it is very desirable that the agreement should be given statutory effect as soon as possible.As regards Clause 2,  the recommendation of the Mackenzie Committee has been supported by the majority of the Police Authorities concerned.    The power to return the deductions could not equitably be given in the case of the police strikers and withheld in the case of men dismissed on other grounds, and it is accordingly proposed to extend retrospectively, to cover the period from 1st July,  1919,  to the commencement of the police Pensions Act,   1921,  the powers Police Authorities now possess under Section 20 of that Act.    This will enable Police Authorities to return the deductions to any men who retired without a pension or gratuity during the period mentioned or to apply the deductions for the benefit offlJiJ^R E T. fi.P. 451(25).
their wives  (or widows) arid children and to adoptthe latter course in the case of any men whowere dismissed in the same period,  including the strikers.The power is made discretionary,  so that any particular police authority who does not desire to return the deductions willnot be placed under obligation to do so.It is proposed to limit the operation of this clause to police forces in England and Hales,  on the ground that the Scottish forces were not affected by the strike and Police Authorities in Scotland, unlike the English Police Authorities, already had power before the Act of 1921 to return rateable deductions to men who were dismissed, excepting only in the relatively rare cases of men dismissed for offences involving fraud or dishonesty.On the merits of this proposal I think I need only say that, while it is clearly impossible to make any concession to the Police strikers as regards their reinstatement in the Police Service,  the policy of the Government from the first has been to accord these men any possible financial concessions. Thus,  a Bill was passed in 1919, with the concurrence of the Government,  to enable Police Authorities to pay to the men the arrears of pay which were outstanding at the time of their dismissal.    The grant of the power to apply the rateable deductions for the benefit of the wives (or widows) and children of the police strikers is  (l) recommended by the Mackenzie Committee,   (2) desired by the majority of the Police Authorities directly concerned,  and  (3) involves in effect only the retrospective application of powers which Police Authorities have been given by the Act of 1921 (as respects men dismissed since the commencement of that Act) and It seems not unreasonable to give retrospective effect, to the extent now proposed, to the present provisions of the Act of 1921.As to the cost of this proposal,  the total number of police strikers who were dismissed (apart from a few who had qualified for pension) was about 2,4-50.    The number of  ether men dismissed or required to retire in the period in question
would, be relatively negligible.    Allowing for single men (who will not benefit under the Bill) and cases in which Police Authorities decide not to exercise their powers,  It seems safe to assume that the total number of  cases in which rateable deductions will be granted to the strikers&apos;  wives or widows wil not exceed 2,000 and that the total amount involved will not exceed &quot;4-0,000,  half of which would be borne by the Exchequer and half by the rates.    Police Authorities may,  in a few oases, take advantage of the Bill to return rateable deductions to men who have retired since 1st July,   1919, and were not granted their deductions at that time, but the amount so involved may be regarded as negligible.It is very desirable that this matter,  like the increase of the rateable ddductions under Clause 1,  should be disposed of as soon as possible.    Olause 1 is not likely to be in any way contentious:    the title of the Bill has been restricted to very narrow limits,  so as to prevent other and controversial proposals being introduced.    In these circumstances,  I hope that,  if my colleagues approve the Bill,  it may be possible to introduce and pass it this year.W.J.H.3rd November,  1925.H28-30
