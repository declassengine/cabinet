s -Document Is the PropertyCONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.CONFIDENTIAL.Circulated to the    Cabinet by direction of Lord Birkenhead.PflBITI&amp;N AT CANT Oil.The position at Canton was explained to the Cabinet in a ForeignOffice memorandum       July 9th.    It was soon after that date that the aircraft harrier H,M0S3 Hermes was despatched to Hongkong.     The position remained more or less unchanged until the second week In August.      The boycott of British goods ana shipping continued with great loss, especially to the colony of Hongkong.      On August 13th His Majesty^ Consul-General at Canton   telegraphed that three new &quot;navigation rules&quot; had been published by the Canton Government:    (l) steamers of any nationality except British and  Japanese are allowed to ply between various ports provided they do not call at Hongkong^ (2)    On entering ports all vessels must be subject to inspection of labour pickets of the anti-Imperialist Unionj      (3) Exports of food-stuffs and raw materials prohibited ,    His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General suggested that maritime treaty powers thus dictated to should immediately institute a blockade at the entrance to the river which could easily be affected.      On August 15th the Commodore, Hongkongj telegraphed that a blockade&apos;would prevent the import of munitions of war which had been arriving freely in Canton lately and might bring about the overthrow of Bolshevik elements at Canton through popular indignation or otherwise force an issue,.     About the same time the French Government were suggesting a naval demonstration at Cantona On August 20th His M.ajestyrs Charge d 1 Affaires at Peking tele-graphed that as the &quot;navigation rules&quot; affected all Powers having ships plying to Canton he suggested that co-operation of all the Bowers concerned would be advisable if the blockade were decided on. At that time he did not feel that such an action was either necessary or advisable or that it vrould bring about the downfall of thedatedCommunist /,
3 9Coinmunist Canton Government; -He added that in the opinion of His Majesty^s Consul-General nothing short of abrogation of the treaties would placate the local government and end the strike, On August 22nd we suggested to Peking the following, course of action which should be taken jointly by the. Powers:    that the attention of the Chinese Government should be drawn to the un-justifiabls regulations issued by the Canton atitborities in breach Of treaty rights, together with a warning that unless the Chinese Government could secure their withdrawal within a specified time limit the Powers would be obliged to take further measures.      We added that if this action further united the Chinese against us the game might not be worth the candle,His Majesty&apos;s Charge  affaires replied that according to the Japanese consul at Canton the &quot;navigation rules&quot;-bed,&apos;&apos;   been issued, merely for effect and were not Intended to be enforced; so neither the Japanese Minister not His Majesty^ Charge d TAffaires are making any formal protest at present to the Chinese Government,, who profess ignorance of the whole matter,.      The Japanese Minister-has expressed&apos; apprehension at newspaper reports as to the attitude of His Majesty^ Government.     His Majesty&apos;s Charge d 1 Affaires cannot help filing that British business circles are inclined to take txro alarmed and exaggerated a -view of the incident., which does not seem to have developed enough, for so drastic a step as a blockade.      In any case, he said,  Japanese, co-operation was essential, their shipping being bracketed with ours, and American highly desirable/   &apos;
o 9desirable.     He considered that isolated  British action would be fatal, and that joint warning of British and American and Japanese governments, -with as many others as would  join, would certainly be beneficial if it became necessary,nowHis Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Canton/reports that the Canton Government havo informed him that they have neither published nor approved the &quot;navigation rules&quot;.     He proposes that a river steamer be sent up from Hongkong to Canton showing the British flag as a test.Meanwhile the Foreign Office has received a series&apos; of appeals from British firms and from such representative bodies as the China Association and the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, asking for  &quot;action&quot; as regards Canton;    the Colonial Office has also passed on resolutions from the Chamber of Commerce in Hongkong with an enquiry as to the attitude of the Foreign Office0      Both British and  Chinsse interest a at Hongkong and the Hongkong Government itself are impressing upon us that they are threatened with immediate ruin, These enquiries . are being answered on the following lines:    &quot;Mr. &quot;Chamberlain doixbts whether a blockade would do more than provide, &quot;anti*British propaganda in Canton and the rest of China, and  any &quot;more drastic action than a blockade he is certain would have a &quot;most unfortunate reaction,:      It must be remembered too that -we are &quot;bound by the Washington-China treaty to full and  frank communication &quot;with other Powers concerned before taking any steps affecting the &quot;sovereignty and independence of China.      Any independent step &quot;therefore which His Majestyrs Government may take at Canton will at &quot;once affect not only the rest of China but our relations with other &quot;Powers having interests in the Far haste      The provocative attitude&quot;of
&quot;of the group of extremists now in control of Canton may he &quot;deliberately calculated to provoke retaliatory measures whereby &quot;they hope to gain in popularity in their own country and to single &quot;out Great -Britain as the oppressor of China.      Such a development &quot;would be specially unfortunate at the present moment, when the &quot;Tariff Conference is about to meet at Peking and solidarity among &quot;the Powers and confidence in our good intentions on the part of the &quot;Chinese people are particularly necessary,,     Mr, Chamberlain will &quot;not hesitate to recommend strong action If and when it is considered &quot;that the situation would be permanently improved thereby.      But &quot;he would prefer to take such&apos;:    v. action in concert with other &quot;Powers whose treaty rights are equally at.stake, and whom, as &quot;explained above, we are under an obligation to consult,.    He would &quot;be most reluctant to act alone exoeptin circumstances where it &quot;would be clear to unprejudiced opinion that he had no reasonable &quot;alternative.&quot;At the same time His Majesty*s Representative at Peking isbe&apos;being consulted as to whether it would/politic at the present &quot;moment foo approach the other Powers with a view to joint action.I have satisfied myself after the most sareful consideration that the cpurse indicated is at the moment the wisest.    A block-ade without a Cabinet decision and without the adhesion of the United States of America and Japan is in my opinion unthinkable. ITor in my judgment would it in any degree alleviate the mischief from which our merchants are suffering.I think, however,  that my colleagues should be kept closely informed of the march of events; and if I think it necessary I shall summon a council of such Ministers as are available.3IRTG321HEAD.Foreign Office,September 4,  1925.
