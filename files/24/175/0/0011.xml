Treasury0 Sir Arthur Bobinson, Ministry of Health,, Sir Horace Wilson, Ministry of Labour. Mr0JoLoJaok, Scottish Board of Health, Mro A0 V, oHurst 9 Treasury.The Minister of Health compared the general position in regard to housing in England and Scotland;, and emphasised the need for special effprt to bo made in Scotland, to promote the building of Steel Houses,    At the present time, Local Authorities in Scotland, as in England, were not embarking on this form of construction to any material extents, partly oviing to fear of trouble with the building operatives s and. partly on financial grounds.    But whereas in England steady progress was now being made with brick construction, in overtaking the arrears of housing, in Scotland;, the situation was becoming worse,,     After discussion with the Secretary for Scotland, he proposed that a special subsidy of  4-0 a house over and above the Wheat ley Subsidy (which in capital value represents about  160) should be offered to Local Authorities in Scotland for the first 4,000 steel houses to be erected under the Scheme within a limited time.    The additional subsidy should not be restricted
to any particular form of steel house but it should, be - -conditional on a low price being obtained, and in orderto secure this, it was essential that the manufacturers ofany one type of house should be able to count on orders ofnot loss than IjOOO houses.    It was generally recognisedthat Local Authorities might still be unwilling to endanger their relations with, the building operativesby accepting these terms, and that the Government might feel bound to go further and embark on a scheme of construction independent of Local Authorities, eitherthrough the medium of an ad hoc Public Utility Society,or otherwise-.It was decidedthat the broad outlines of the proposals of the Minister of health and the Secretary for Scotland be approved and that the representatives of the Departments concerned should meet under the Chairmanship of Pi&amp;- George Barstow to work out the details of the scheme and to prepare a statement which the Prime Minister might embody in his speech at Glasgow on the 1st October,
NOTE BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.In view of the developments which may arise in the immediate future on the question of the wages and conditions of railwaymen, I circulate the annexed memorandum on the present situation for the information of my colleagues. I propose to circulate a further memo-rahdum as soon as the indications of the direction in which events are likely to develop become more definite.A.
