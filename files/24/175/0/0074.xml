This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.OOIFIDENTIALPrinted for the Cabinet, November, 1925.SECRET.Copt&quot; No.   1CP. 474 (25).THE CABINET.RETENTION OF A BRITISH  CAVALRY REGIMENT INPALESTINE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. The Cabinet at their meeting (32 (25)) held on 1st July, 1925, approved a recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence, at their 200th Meeting, that the British Cavalry Regiment now in Palestine should be maintained there for another year, until it had been seen what effect Abd-el-Krim&apos;s successes would have on the Mohammedan world generally, and what attitude would be adopted by the Wahabis.2. The recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which the Cabinet approved, was based on the situation then existing and the possibility that the General Officer Commanding British troops in Egypt might be called upon for reinforcements for Transjordania, and it was for these reasons that I advised the retention of the regiment for another year. The situation has now materially altered, both as regards Abd-el-Krim and the Wahabis, and a Wahabi attack on Transjordania, may now be regarded as most improbable. As far as the War Office is concerned, therefore, there are now no grounds for the retention of this regiment in Palestine.3. Since the Cabinet decision referred to above, the War Office has been in communication with the Colonial Office as to the incidence of cost of the cavalry regiment while it remains in Palestine. In theory I hold that the full cost of the regiment should fall on the Middle East Yote, but I was prepared to agree that for 1926-27, as during the current financial year, a contribution of  40,000 only should be made from Colonial Office Funds to the Army Vote in respect of the regiment. The Secretary of State for the Colonies was not, however, prepared to agree that any contribution should be made, and in any case proposed to defer the question until the estimate for Middle Eastern Services was considered. If there is to be no contribution from the Colonial Office, it is clearly advantageous financially from the point of view of Army Estimates to withdraw the regiment to the United Kingdom. Such a course will mean a saving in connection with its relief, which would otherwise take place next January, and with the despatch of some 400-500 remounts to Egypt during 1926, while capital expenditure of at least  15,000 on barrack services which are urgently necessary if a British regiment is to continue to be stationed there, would be avoided. Moreover, the maintenance of a cavalry regiment at home would cost some  10,000 a year less than in Palestine.4. Iii view of the changed strategical situation and of the financial considerations mentioned above, I ask that the Cabinet decision taken in July may be reconsidered. As the matter is one of extreme urgency both because arrangements for the relief of the regiment are well in hand and to enable me to prepare my Estimates for 1926, a very early decision is desirable.The War Office,November, 1925.L. W.-E.(B25/17)   100   11/25   W.O.P.   2105
