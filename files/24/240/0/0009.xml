THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1933.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 109 (33).CABINET.ANGLO- EGYPTIAN NEGOTIATIONS.IN accordance with the decision reached at the meeting of the Egypt Sub-Committee on the 14th March, I circulate to the Cabinet the following papers : 1. A brief outline of previous negotiations and of modifications in previousoffers entailed by the new draft. 2. Note on the reasons for and against the initiation of steps leading up toAnglo-Egyptian negotiations. 3. Note on the points at issue between the Service Departments and theForeign Office, on which a decision is required should it be decided to open negotiations:  a summary of the past history of the mostimportant of these points, namely, the location of the British forcesin Egypt under a treaty settlement, is appended. 4. Note on the position which it is intended under the Foreign office proposals to secure for the Sudan. 5. Text of the full draft treaty settlement, which is, of course, subject tothe decisions reached under heading 3 above.The course of action wrhich i wish to propose, should the Foreign Office suggestions be approved, is that His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Cairo should be instructed (after the necessary communication has been made to the Dominions) to open preliminary discussions with the Egyptian Prime Minister in Cairo on the two main points of the location of the forces and of the Sudan. On receipt of Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s report of the result of these conversations, it should be possible to decide whether or not to proceed with the negotiation of the draft settlement as a whole.In circulating these papers I wish to emphasise that, in my judgment and in that of my advisers, there is no possibility of securing a treaty settlement with Egypt on terms less favourable to that country than those contemplated in the Foreign Office draft. That draft already embodies modifications in favour of the United Kingdom of considerable importance as compared with the terms offered to Egypt in 1929 and in 1930. These modifications refer mainly, but not solely, to the liberty of action secured for the forces in Egypt and to the circumstances in which Egypfs assistance as an ally is to be available.It would seem to follow that, should the attempt to negotiate be unsuccessful, or, equally, should no such attempt be made, the policy contained in the declaration of 1922 must be regarded, and will, in fact, be regarded, in Egypt as having lapsed. In effect, His Majesty&apos;s Government would then, in my view, find themselves under the necessity of devising a new Anglo-Egyptian policy.J. S.Foreign Office, April 12, 1933.6841   [8486JBsisitflisnsttii
A Brief Outline of Previous Negotiations and of Modifications in Previous Offers Entailed by the New Draft.The more recent previous attempts to reach a settlement have been the following1927-28: Sarwat-Chamberlain. 1929 : Mahmoud-Henderson. 1930 : Nahas-Henderson.These attempts broke down primarily on considerations of Egyptian internal politics.   The ostensible cause of rupture in each ease was : 1927-28. After Sarwat Pasha (a minority Prime Minister) had negotiated a draft, the majority (Nahas Pasha and the Wafd) refused to accept a settlement which left the British forces in Egyptian territory.1929. Headings for a settlement were negotiated with Mahmoud Pasha, who was, however, in the position of a dictator, governing without a Parliament. He was therefore required by His Majesty&apos;s Government to submit the agreed headings to public opinion iri Egypt, and this he proved unable to do.1930. The ostensible cause of rupture was the Sudan, Egypt demanding (a) unrestricted right of immigration, and (6) the right to raise the appli-eation of the 1899 Conventions after a year frdni the signature Of the treaty.As compared with the 1927-28 negotiations, the 1929 and 1930 negotiations had one useful result in that the Egyptians were brought, for the first time since 1882, to declare their readiness to accept the presence of British forces on Egjrptian territory.These negotiations have marked a progressive extension of the concessions offered to the Egyptians. The present draft settlement has been drawn up in the belief that the 1929 and 1930 negotiations, ^vhile safeguarding the British position in the Sudan, carried the process of concession too far for the security of British interests in Egypt. There would to-day be no chance of securing Egyptian acceptance of the terms offered iri 1927-28; but a return to a point between 1927-28 and 1929 appears necessary if a basis for the resumption of negotiations satis-factory to Us is to be established.As contrasted with the 1930 negotiations the high-water mark from the Egyptian point of view the new draft, while maintaining the main features of the 1929 and 1930 offers to Egypt, viz. :-(1) The abolition of the restrictiori on her sovereigiity represented by the 1922 Reserved Points, thus making possible her adiriissiori into the League of Nations;(2) The alliance with Great Britain;(3) The removal of the British forces from the cities;(4) The opening of the way to a substantial riiodification of the Capitulations.presents the following modifications :-1. Far-reaching revision, in accordance with the considered requireirierits of the Service Departments, of the areas allotted to the British forces within the Canal Zone. *2. Abolition in the event Of war, threat of War, or serious disturbance within the Erivpire or iri adjacent territories, of the&apos; restriction on the nUriibefs of the British land and air forces to be maintained iri Egypt.3. Provision for the absolute freedom of moveinerit Of British service aircraft;4. Egypt&apos;s assistance as an ally (use of ports, aerodromes, riieaiis Of coin-munication, &amp;c.) to be available not merely in time of war, but also of internal disturbance within the Empire.5. Definition in a separate convention of the privileges and imriiunities to be secured to the British forces in Egypt.6. Strengthening of the provisions for the retention of a foreign element, including British commandants, in the Egyptian city police.7. Strengthening of the provision intended to secure against the replacement of British officials by nationals of other foreign Powers.
8. As contrasted with 1930, the chief British officials in the Egyptian service (the Financial and Judicial Advisers) are to be retained, not for the period of their existing contracts, but, in the case of the latter, until the contemplated internal reforms, and in particular the transfer of jurisdiction from the consular to the Mixed Courts are completed and tested. The position of the Financial Adviser is left more vague. It would undoubtedly be in the interests of both parties jf the post were retained until the treaty settlement had been carried into effect, but it seems best to rely, in part, on the Egyptians appreciating this for themselves.Elimination of the article allowing for reopening of the question of the Sudan within one year from the coming into force of the treaty.10. Minimum period of validity of the treaty settlement extended from ten to twenty years.II. Provision for periodical meetings of a Nile Commission in Cairo under the presidency of an Egyptian Minister.Of these eleven major modifications, the first ten will infallibly be construed by the Egyptians as constituting derogations from the 1930 offer. As compared with 1929, Nos. 3, 4. 5, 6 and 7 may be regarded as constituting modifications in our favour.(2)Note on the Reasons For and Against the Initiation of Steps leading up to Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations.1. The 1922 declaration (which at present governs our relations with Egypt) postulates negotiations. I may be well to quote it in full. (Please see below.)2. The present moment appears suitable for a number of reasons, some positive and some negative.Positive.(a) The present Government in Egypt is half-way between a palace and a popular (i.e., Wafdist) Government.We cannot afford to negotiate with the former; we cannot in fact hope to negotiate successfully with the latter (cf. 1924, 1927 and 1930).(&amp;) We have successfully tested our ability to &quot;do business &quot; with the present Egyptian regime in such matters as pivil aviation and cables and wireless.(c) The present Egyptian regime attach an adequate and definite value, in existing economic and world conditions, to the ailianpfs with Great Britain which is a feature of the settlement, In this they are unlike their predecessors, who have never viewed the alliance otherwise than with a scarcely-veiled suspicion.Negative.(a) If we do not negotiate a settlement in some determinable future, great difficulty is to be f oreseen in continuing to bottle up at least two questions which have a most important and direct bearing on Anglo-Egyptian relations. These are the entry of Egypt into the League of Nations and the continuance of the capitulatqry regime in Egypt.The former of these issues has been made much more acute for Egypt by the admission firstly of Turkey and now of Iraq into the League. Yet the admission of an Egypt unbound by treaty would be fraught with very considerable danger to our position in that country.Of the second issue, the continuance of the capitulatory regime, it may be said that Egypt&apos;s, moral right to a revision enabling her to simplify the mass of conflicting jurisdictions under which she has to carry on her administration and (to take one instance only) to deal adequately with the scum of the Levant and of Europe white-slavers, drug-traffickers, &amp;c. in her territories, has been recognised by the highest authorities for years, from Orpine r through Milner downwards.  On the fiscal side, too, she is debarred, by the difficulties in the way
of making her legislation obligatory upon foreigners, from that broadening of the basis of hwr revenues which all other modern States have long since found necessary.To postpone dealing with this issue of the Capitulations is definitely dangerous. Yet it is an issue on which we have everything to give and nothing to receive. To determine it in advance and independently of general negotiations must therefore weaken our bargaining power for the purposes of the latter.(6) From a more general point of view it is a mistake to assume that, because Egypt is quiet, she may safely be left alone. It was precisely the adoption of this view after the war which marked the beginning of all our more recent troubles connected with the growth of nationalism and of the Wafd.Should the present Egyptian regime be given ground to believe that delay on our side in negotiating (delay which has already been prolonged for two years since the change of Government in Egypt) is to be construed as unwillingness to negotiate at all, the result anticipated by the Foreign Office is that we shall gradually (but probably more rapidly than might be supposed) be confronted with a united Nationalist Egypt, as in the period from 1919 to 1922, but with the addition of King Fuad himself at the head of the movement.On the assumption that His Majesty&apos;s present Government intend to continue, and to implement, the policy towards Egypt defined in the declaration of 1922. and that, for that purpose, they are prepared to renew the concession, already offered to Egypt in the 1929 and 1930 negotiations (without this the Foreign Office regard the securing of a treaty settlement as impossible), of withdrawing the British forces to the Canal Zone in return for Egyptian acceptance of the presence of these forces on Egyptian territory, and on the completion of accommodation to be built by Egypt in the zone selected, the only reasons which (it would seem) can be urged against the initiation of steps leading up to negotiations are : (1) The preoccupation of His Majesty&apos;s Government with other subjects. (2) The danger lest a further unsuccessful attempt to negotiate may bringon the unfavourable and dangerous situation in Egypt which it is theobject of negotiations to avert.In the view of the Foreign Office both these arguments have already been allowed for to the fullest extent which is either reasonable or safe.Declaration to Egypt, 1922.Whereas His Majesty&apos;s Government, in accordance with their declared intentions, desire forthwith to recognise Egypt as an independent sovereign State; andWhereas the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Egypt are of vital interest to the British Empire;The following principles are hereby declared : 1. The British Protectorate over Egypt is terminated, and Egypt is declared to be an independent sovereign State.2. So soon as the Government of His Highness shall pass an Act of Indemnity with application to all inhabitants of Egypt, martial law as proclaimed on the 2nd November, 1914, shall be withdrawn.3. The following matters are absolutely reserved to the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government until such time as it may be possible, by free discussion and friendly accommodation on both sides, to conclude agreements in regard thereto between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Egypt: (a) The security of the communications of the British Empire inEgypt.(b) The defence of Egypt against all foreign aggression or inter-ference, direct or indirect..(c) The protection of foreign interests in Egypt and the protection of minorities.(d) The Sudan.Pending the conclusion of such agreements, the status quo in all these matters shall remain intact.
Note on the Points at Issue between the Service Departments and the Foreign Office, on which a Decision is required should it be Decided to open Negotiations.These points are two in number : (1) The Location of the British Forces.The Service Departments are understood to be prepared : (a) To withdraw the three battalions now quartered within.the city limits of Cairo (two battalions) and Alexandria (one battalion).(b) To reduce the British forces in Egypt by two of the battalions sowithdrawn (this concession has not been suggested bv the Foreign, 0ffice)-(c) To add the third battalion so withdrawn to the forces already quarteredin the suburbs of Cairo.The result of these proposals would be that the forces would be divided between the suburbs of Cairo and the Canal Zone; it is suggested that these proposals should be pressed upon the Egyptians on the grounds of the saving of expenditure by Egypt on the construction of new barracks and of the time required for such construction.The Foreign Office hold that it is useless to expect Egypt to accept these proposals in view of : (a) National feeling against the continued presence of foreign troops in thevicinity of the capital.(b) The previous offers made to Egypt.The following is a note on the previous history of this question : Committee of Imperial Defence report of the 4th February, 1924, which -was subsequently approved by the Cabinet, put forward the view that, &quot; from a military point of view, in order to secure the safety of our vital communications through the Suez Canal, the best solution would be if the Egyptian Government could be induced to allow British troops to remain in Cairo and existing air stations at Heliopolis and Helouan. If this solution should prove impossible to obtain, the next best plan from a military point of view would be to negotiate for the retention of such positions as would enable a British garrison of moderate size, including air stations at Heliopolis and Helouan, to provide for the defence of Egypt from the north-east without being exposed to the danger of attack from the reverse side.&quot;After the breakdown of the negotiations between Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and Zaghlul Pasha in 1924, the Chiefs of Staff submitted a report (572-B of the 27th January, 1925), in which they declared that a comprehensive defence of the Suez Canal could only be arranged if based on a secure hold on Egypt itself; the defence of the Canal must be organised in depth, a shallow line along the Canal itself being impossible; for purely military reasons they considered that British troops should remain in Egypt in their present positions; if, however, for political reasons it was considered necessary to give up the military occupation of Cairo and its immediate vicinity, then the safety of the Canal might still be provided for, but it would be a difficult and costly operation. The Chief of the Air Staff (Lord Trenchard) added the following note : &quot; I agree with the above report in considering that troops disposed as at present constitute the best defence of the Canal, yet, in my opinion, the same number of troops (ground, air and other services) could defend the Canal if stationed in the vicinity, provided that a large sum of money were first expended in making the necessary stations.&quot;Lord Cavan did not agree with the latter part of this note. The Committee of Imperial Defence accepted the Chiefs of Staff report.The next stage reached was the negotiations between Sir Austen Chamberlain and Sarwat Pasha in 1927.   The draft treaty authorised the maintenance upon
Egyptian territory of such armed forces as His Majesty&apos;s Government considered necessary to secure the protection of the lines of communication of the British Empire and pending the conclusion qf an agreement by which Ilis Britannic Majesty entrusts His Majesty the King of Egypt with the task of ensuring this protection; after ten years the two Governments would reconsider the question of the localities in which the British forces were to be stationed; in the event of disagreement the question might be submitted to the Council pf the League of Nations.The Chiefs of Staff reviewed the question again in July 1929 (957-B) on the basis of the draft which was under discussion with Mohammed Mahmoud Pasha. The draft provided for the withdrawal of the British garrison to localities to be agreed upon to the east of longitude 32Q E. [i.e., in the Canal Zone). The Chiefs of Staff stated their opinion that, so far as the defence of our Imperial communications was concerned, this provision involved the abandonment of a position which was strategically sound for one that was much inferior; no reduction of the garrison would probably be possible; the British forces would no longer be in a position to protect the lives and property of foreign nationals in Egypt outside the Canal Zone. The objections of the Chiefs of Staff were not upheld by the Cabinet, which decided to offer to the Egyptians the withdrawal or the garrison to the east of longitude 320 E. (i.e., in the Canal Zone), and this provision wras included in the published proposals for ail Anglo-Egyptian settlement.In 1930 an Egyptian delegation led by Nahas Pasha came to London to negotiate on these proposals. After lengthy discussion they eventually agreed to the concentration of the British forces to the west of the Suez Canal in the neighbourhood of Ismailia; the co-operation of the Egyptian forces in the defence of the Canal was specifically mentioned; the Royal Air Fprce depot would be transferred from Aboukir to Port Fuad; after twenty years the question whether the Egyptian army was able to ensure by its own resources the liberty and entire security of navigation in the Canal wras to be submitted to the League of Nations if the two Governments failed to agree on this point. These provisions were contingent on agreement being reached with the Egyptians on various important points, which included the question of numbers, the adequacy of the area contemplated, the provision of training grounds, water supply and amenities, and freedom of movement for service airplanes. The Secretaries of State for War and Air at the time were members of the British delegation during these negotiations, and naturally discussed the service provisions direct with the Egyptian delegates.Subsequent to the breakdown of the negotiations the Chiefs of Staff presented a report (1011-B of July 30) in which they pointed out that the British negotiators had been prepared to differ from the advice previously tendered by the Chiefs of Staff in the following respects : (a) The removal of the garrison to the Canal Zone, (b) the possible eventual defence of the Canal by the Egyptian army, (c) the co-operation of the Egyptian army in the defence of the Canal, (d) the submission to the League of Nations of the ultimate removal of the British forces, (e) limitation 0f numhers of those forces, (/) restrictions on the freedom of movement of aircraft. The Chiefs of Staff itecogmsed that political considera-tions might necessitate the acceptance of (a), (6), (c) and (d), but they attached the greatest importance to (e) and (/).The present Foreign Office proposals, instead of the narrow concentration of the forces proposed ip 1930, contemplate their removal from their present stations to localities east pf longitude 32Q E., which have heen selected by the Service authorities themselves after a thorough examination of the whole Canal Zone.It is understood that the present Service Department objections to this proposal are based upon the danger of attack from the west, either by Egypt or by some third party with Egyptian assistance. While naturally claiming no^ authority upon strategic questions, the Foreign Office feel obliged to contest any idea that an Egypt bound to this country by a Treaty of Alliance is in the least likely either herself to attack the Canal or to assist any other Power to do so. Any attack, or threat of attack, upon Egyptian territory by a third Power would, moreover, bring article 7 of the Draft Treaty into force and secure full use of Egyptian facilities, and freedom of movement within Egypt, for our forces.
(2) Censorship in Egypt.The Service Departments would have liked to secure the acceptance by Egypt of an obligation to set up a British censorship in time of emergency.The Foreign Office feel that the insertion of a clause of this nature in a treaty settlement which is ostensibly between two equals is entirely out of the question.They represent further that (d) Ah &apos;&apos; effective &apos;&apos; censorship in times of emergency is provided for (article 7). In practice, a censorship to be effective will have to be British.(b) Failure on the part of the Egyptians to establish an effective censorshipwould be a breach of a treaty engagement and would supply us with grounds for taking our own measures.(c) Some reliance must be placed upon the influence in these matters ofthe British Military Mission; which is to he attached to the Egyptian army.The Service Departments feel the force of these arguments, but are anxious to place it on record that the proposed solution, even though it may be the best practicable, is not the ideal one in a matter in which Egypt represents an even more important link in our chain of communications than the Irish Free State in respect of which the 1921 Agreement is understood to have occasioned great difficulties in practice.(4)Note on the Position which it is intended under the Foreign Office Proposals to secure for the Sudan.As in previous treaty negotiations, our endeavour is to confirm the existing position of the Sudan as an Ahglo-egypt^ptian condominium in which Great Britain is the active, Egypt the sleeping, partner;The wording of article 12 of the draft treaty is further designed to guard against any post-treaty attempt by Egypt to claim that the working of the condominium in the Sudan, as originally established by the Boutros-Cromer Conventions of 1899, has been illegally interfered with by our action in 1924, when, after a mutiny of Sudanese troops provoked by Egyptian intrigue and the murder of the Sirdar, Sir Lee Stack, in Cairo, the Egyptian troops and higher officials were expelled from the Sudan.As concessions to Egypt it is proposed to offer her : (a) The Nile Commission referred to in article. 13 of the draft treaty, a bodyuniting British colonial, Sudanese and Egyptian experts meeting from time to time in Cairo, with powers of recommendation on matters affecting Nile development;(b) Outside the treaty settlement-leave to appoint an Egyptian Agent atKhartoum in a position corresponding to that of the Sudan Agent in Cairo. This position would not, of course, involve any diplomatic status, but merely access to the Sudan Government on commercial and other matters of secondary importance.On the question of the Egyptian subvention to the cost Of the administration of the Sudan at present  E. 750,000 no decision has yet been reached whether the continuance of the subvention should be provided for in the treaty or not. On present information the Foreign Office are inclined to think it preferable that the matter should remain on the basis of a &quot; gentlemen&apos;s agreement.&quot; This was the form in which the subvention originally canie into being : it was the Egyptian Government who insisted on making the payment, although they interrupted it for a year or two in Zaghlul&apos;s time, and, since its resumption at its present figure, have once or twice shown an inconvenient desire to scale it down. But it should be easier to decide this point once the negotiations are in progress. In the 1921 (Curzon-Adly) negotiations, a clause proposing to provide for financial assistance by Egypt to the Sudan was rejected by the Egyptiaiis.
. Under the draft settlement Egypt would derive the following advantages from a Sudan of which the Administration would continue to be wholly British :-&apos;*&quot;;(*) Theoretical joint sovereignty, practical manifestations of which are : (1) The Egyptian flag is flown side by side with the British.(2) The Governor-General is nominated by the King of Egypt, although on the recommendation of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(3) The Grand Kadi (chief Moslem religious authority) is to be taken from Egypt whenever this does not conflict with the claims of the Sudanese themselves to fill the position.(b) Under the 1899 Convention Egyptian goods are admitted free of duty intothe Sudan: United Kingdom goods pay the ordinary duty, averaging 8 per cent, ad valorem..Each country exports about two million sterling per annum to the Sudan.(c) Egypfs irrigation interests in the Nile valley outside Egypt proper are maintained by a Power which is at once friendly and able to protect these interests : her southern frontier is similarly protected.(5)Draft Treaty Settlement.N.B. In certain passages the appropriate style of His Majesty the King and the use of such words as &apos;; British &quot; and &quot; Britannic &quot; have not yet been determined.1. Draft Treaty.2. Draft Exchange of General Notes.3. Draft Exchange of Notes in regard to the Reform of the Capitulations. 4. Draft Convention governing the status and privileges of the British forces in Egypt (not included).1. Draft Treaty.His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and His Majesty the King of Egypt,Being anxious to consolidate the friendship and the relations of good understanding between them and to co-operate in the execution of their international obligations in preserving the peace of the world.And considering that these objects will best be achieved by the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and alliance, which in their common interest will provide for effective co-operation in preserving peace and ensuring the defence of their respective territories, and shall govern their mutual relations in the future.Have agreed to conclude a treaty for this purpose, and have appointed as their plenipotentiaries :  .His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India :For Great Britain and Northern Ireland : His Majesty the King of Egypt:who, having communicated their full powers, found in good and due form, have1 agreed as follows : 1. The military occupation of Egypt by the forces of His Britannic Majesty is terminated.2. In recognition of their common interests and as a sign of their friendship an alliance is established between the high contracting parties.
3. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom undertake to support any request for admission to the League of Nations which Egypt may present in the conditions prescribed by article 1 of the Covenant.4. Should either of the high contracting parties become engaged in a dispute with a third State, which is likely to lead to a rupture, the high contracting parties will, at the request of either of them, consult each other with a view to the settlement of the said dispute by peaceful means in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of any other international obligations which may be applicable to the case.5. Each of the high contracting parties undertakes not to adopt in foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance or which is likely to-give rise to difficulties for the other pai-ty, nor to conclude with a third Power any agreement of a political character prejudicial to the interests of the other1 party.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom recognise that the responsibility for the protection of the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt devolves henceforth upon the Egyptian Government, who will ensure the fulfilment of their obligations in this respect.7. Should, notwithstanding the provisions of article 4 above, either of the high contracting parties become engaged in war, the other high contracting party will, subject always to the provisions of article 14 below, immediately come to his aid in the capacity of an ally. The aid of His Majesty the King of Egypt, in the event of war, will consist in furnishing to His Britannic Majesty, on Egyptian territory, in accordance with the Egyptian system of administration and legislation, all the facilities and assistance in his power, including the use of his ports, aerodromes and means of communication, provision being made for their effective control, including if necessary the imposition of an effective censorship. It will accordingly be for the Egyptian Government to take all the administrative and legislative measures necessary to render these facilities and assistance effective. These facilities and assistance will also be furnished at the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the event of imminent menace of war or of serious disturbance within the territories under the sovereignty or authority of His Britannic Majesty or territories adjacent thereto, or in the event of a threat to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s essential communications.8. In vieAv of the friendship between the high contracting parties and of the alliance constituted by the present treaty, the Egyptian Government, when in need of foreign officials, will employ British subjects, except in the post of Director-General of the Department of Antiquities and in the case of posts for which foreigners other than British subjects are, from the nature of the position, obviously more suitable. More particularly, and in view of the desirability of securing identity in training and methods between the Egyptian and British armies, the Egyptian Government undertake to select all such foreign military instructors as they deem necessary from among British subjects.;9. His Majesty the King of Egypt, recognising that the Suez Canal and the&quot;adjacent territories, while being an integral part of Egypt, furnish an essential artery ofall forms of communication between the different parts of the British Empire (the permanent maintenance and protection of which is in the &quot;common interest of both high contracting parties), authorises His Britannic Majesty to maintain upon Egyptian territory, in localities in the vicinity of the Canal, such forces&apos; as His Britannic Majesty considers necessary to ensure the protection of this artery of communication. The presence of these forces shall not constitute in any manner an occupation, and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rights of Egypt.The detailed :arrangements for carrying into effect the provisions of this article are cdntainedvin the Annex hereto.&apos;;.   i i ::-  -- ii&quot;    bin     r,. Annex.1. (a.) The British forces to be maintained in the vicinity of the Canal will be restricted to the area east of line 32c, and will be distributed, as regards the land forces, between1 Port Said (port detachment only), Moascar and the Geneifa area on the south-west side of Great Bitter Lake; and, as regards the air forces, between Abu Sueir, Ismailia, Moascar, the Nefisha area, and an area at the north
-end of Great Bitter Lake, west of the Canal, with emergency landing grounds at Port Fuad and Kantara, near Suez, Romani and the El Hemeira Tower., on the Cairo-Suez road, seaplane moorings and facilities at Port Said and Suez, and a practice camp in the desert west of the northern extremity of Great Bitter Lake on the line 32c 10&apos;. The areas and localities referred to above are indicated in the map (scale      ) which is annexed to the treaty. u \(6) Except in the circumstances contemplated in article 7, the British forces to be maintained in Egypt shall be limited to 8,000(&apos;) of the land forcesaand.air forces to the number of 400 pilots, together with the necessary ancillary personnel for administrative and technical duties. .1 /.(c) In the &quot;localities specified above there shall be provided sufficientjjfor the needs of British land and air forces the necessary lands and permanent bar rack and technical accommodation, including an emergency water supply. Theulands. accommodation and water supply shall be suitable according to modern standards. In addition, amenities such as are reasonable, having regard to the character of these localities, will be provided by the planting of trees, gardens, &amp;c, forrthe troops, and the erection of a convalescent camp on the Mediterranean coast: !o v(d) All new works necessary to provide the accommodation, water supply, amenities and convalescent camp referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph, over and above the accommodation already existing in these localities, will be under-taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Egyptian Government will defray the cost. The numbers of personnel for whom additional barrack and technical accommodation shall be provided, at the cost of the Egyptian Government shall be limited to British land forces to the number of 8.000 and British air forces to the number of 2,624, of which 1,111 are civilian artisans and labourers. The plans and estimates of the work to be undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government will be submitted to the Egyptian Government, and agreed between the two Governments before the work is begun.(e) When the works referred to in the two preceding sub-paragraphs have been fully completed, and their cost defrayed by the Egyptian Government, the British forces then present in other parts of Egypt will withdraw therefrom, and will hand over to the Egyptian Government all land and buildings so vacated other than those in private ownership.(/) Any difference of opinion between the two Governments relating to the execution of sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) above will be submitted to the decision of an arbitral board composed of three members, one chosen by each of the two Governments, and the third nominated by the two Governments in common agreement.  The decision of the board shall be final.2. The immunities and privileges in jurisdictional and fiscal matters to be enjoyed by the British forces in Egypt will be determined in a separate convention to be concluded between the two Governments.       j3. Unless the two Governments agree to the contrary, the; Egyptian Govern-ment will prohibit the passage of aircraft over the territories situated on.either side of the Suez Canal and within 20 kilom. of it, except fjpr the purpose of passage from east to west, or vice versa, by means of a corridor 10 kilom.,wide at Kantara. This prohibition will not, however, apply to the forces of the .t,wo Governments or to genuinely Egyptian air organisations or to air organisations of any part of the British Commonwealth of Nations operating under trie authority of the Egyptian Government. .;/4. The Egyptian Government will accord, and provide, when necessary,, all reasonable means of communication and access to and from(the localities where the British forces are situated, and will also accord facilitie^ at. Port Said and Suez for the landing and storage of British military and aeronautical material and supplies.5. British military aircraft shall enjoy complete freedom of smovement on service occasions over Egyptian territory. The Egyptian Government will give all necessary facilities to British military aircraft, personnel and stores on passage to and from the aerodromes and seaplane anchorages placed at the disposal of the British forces, and for the purpose of such passage will secure the maintenance and availability at all times of such aerodromes, seaplane anchorages and landing-grounds in Egyptian territory as are required. Visits by representatives of the British Air Force for the purpose of ascertaining the condition of such aerodromes and seaplane anchorages and laying the necessary fuel dumps and(&apos;) [10,500 in the event of the troops not remaining in the suburbs of Cairo.]
moorings shall be permitted. His Majesty&apos;s Government will give reciprocal facilities in their aerodromes arid seaplane anchorages in the Canal Zone to Egyptian military aircraft, personnel and stores on passage to and from Egyptian aerodromes and seaplane anchorages.6. The Egyptian Government will, in the exercise of their powers as regards radio-electric communications, take into account the requirements of the wireless telegraph stations of the British forces in Egypt, and will continue to co-operate with the British authorities to prevent any mutual interference between British and Egyptian wireless telegraph stations.(End of Annex.)10. His Britannic Majesty recognises that the capitulatory regime now existing in Egypt is no longer in accordance with the spirit of the times and with the present state of Egypt.His Britannic Majesty accordingly undertakes to use all his influence with the Powers possessing capitulatory rights in Egypt to obtain, in conditions which will safeguard the legitimate interests of foreigners, the transfer to the Mixed Tribunals of the jurisdiction of the existing Consular Courts and the application of Egyptian legislation to foreigners.11. His Britannic Majesty will henceforth be represented at the Court of His Majesty the King of Egypt by an Ambassador, duly accredited, who will have precedence over all other diplomatic representatives accredited to that Court.His Majesty the King of Egypt will be represented at the Court of St. Jameses by an Ambassador.12. While reserving liberty to conclude new conventions in future, modi-fying the conventions of 1899. the high contracting parties agree that the status of the Sudan shall continue to be that resulting from the said conventions. Accordingly, the Governor-General shall continue to exercise on the joint behalf of the high contracting parties the powers conferred upon him by the said conventions.13. In pursuance of paragraph 5 of the Egyptian Prime Ministers note of the 7th May, 1929, to His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner, forming part of the exchange of notes between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Egyptian Government in regard to the use of the waters of the River Nile for irrigation purposes, the high contracting parties agree that the irrigation experts of Egypt, the Sudan and Uganda Protectorate shall meet at Cairo, not less often than once in every three years, for the purpose of discussion and the exchange of information, particularly in regard to any major irrigation projects which may be contemplated by any of the countries concerned. The Egyptian Minister of Public Works, or his deputy, shall preside over these meetings and the high contracting parties undertake to attach the greatest possible weight to any resolutions or expressions of opinion which may result therefrom.14. Nothing in the present treaty is intended to or shall in any way prejudice the rights and obligations which devolve, or may devolve, upon either of the high contracting parties under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty for the Renunciation of War signed at Paris on the 27th August. 1928.15.

The present treaty is.subject to ratification. Ratifications shall be exchanged in Cairo as soon as possible. The treaty shall come into force on the date of the exchange of ratifications.
2. Draft Exchange of General Notes.gjr British Note.I wish to place on record the understandings which have been reached between us in regard to various important matters arising out of, or in connexion with, the treaty which we have signed to-day.In regard to matters pf a military character, we are agreed as follows : 1. British personnel shall be withdrawn from the Egyptian army, and the functions of the Inspector-General and his staff shall terminate.2. The Egyptian Government, desiring to perfect the training of the Egyptian army and intending, in accordance with article 8 of the treaty, that such foreign instructors as they may deem necessary shall be chosen from amongst British subjects only, will avail themselves of the advice of a British military mission. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will furnish the military mission which the Egyptian Government desire and will also undertake to receive, and provide training in the United Kingdom for, any personnel of the Egyptian forces which the Egyptian Government may desire to send for the purposes of being trained. In the circumstances created by this treaty, the Egyptian Government will, naturally, not desire to send any personnel of their armed forces to be trained abroad elsewhere than in the United Kingdom.3. In the interests of the alliance and in view of the possible necessity of active co-operation between the British and Egyptian forces, the armament and equipment of the Egyptian forces shall not differ in type from those of the British forces. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom undertake to use their good offices to facilitate the supply of such armament and equipment from the United Kingdom whenever the Egyptian Government so desire. In regard to other matters 4. The Egyptian Government intend to abolish the European Department of the Ministry of the Interior, but will retain, pending the transfer of juris-diction contemplated in article 10 of the treaty, an effective European element on the existing scale in their city police, which will include British commandants of the said police. The question shall then be reviewed in the light of the new duties for which, under the transfer of jurisdiction, the services of this element may seem to be required.5. With a view to securing expert assistance for the extensive programme of internal reforms which they contemplate, the Egyptian Government propose to retain the post of judicial adviser to the Ministry of Justice until such time as the reforms in question, and particularly the transfer of jurisdiction contemplated in article 10 of the treaty, have been not merely introduced, but tested. The Egyptian Government further propose to retain for the present the post of financial adviser. These officials, with such assistants as may be considered necessary, will be British subjects, but will hold their appointments as Egyptian officials from the Egyptian Government.6. The two Governments agree that, so soon as the general economic situation permits, the question of the indebtedness of the Sudan to Egypt shall be examined with a view to settlement on fair and equitable lines.7. The two Governments are agreed ;that there shall be no discrimination in the Sudan between British subjects and Egyptian nationals in matters of commerce and immigration or the possession of property.8. As regards the method by which international conventions are to be made applicable to the Sudan, the two Governments are agreed as follows : The general principle for the future shall be that international conventions shall only become applicable to the Sudan by the joint action of the Governments of the United Kingdom and of Egypt, and that such joint action shall similarly also be required if it is desired to terminate the participation of the Sudan in an international convention which already applies to this territory.Conventions to which it will be desired that the Sudan should be a party will generally be conventions of a technical or humanitarian character. Such conventions almost invariably contain a provision for subsequent accession, and in such cases this method of making the convention applicable to the Sudan will be adopted. Accession will be effected by a joint instrument, signed on behalf of Egypt and the United Kingdom respectively by two persons duly appointed for
the purpose. The method of depositing the instrument of accession will be the subject of agreement in each case between the two Governments. In the event of its being desired to apply to the Sudan a convention which does not contain an accession clause, the method by which this should be effected will be the subject of consultation and agreement between the two Governments.If the Sudan is already a party to a convention, and it is desired to terminate the participation of the Sudan therein, the necessary notice of termination will be given jointly by the United Kingdom and by Egypt.It is understood that the participation of the Sudan in a convention and the termination of such participation can only be effected by joint action specifically taken in respect of the Sudan, and does not follow merely from the fact that the United Kingdom and Egypt are both parties to a convention or have both denounced a convention.At international conferences where such conventions are negotiated the Egyptian and United Kingdom delegates would naturally keep in touch with a view to any action which they may agree to be desirable in the interests of the Sudan.9. The question of the protection of minorities, which figured in the Declaration of the 28th February, 1922, is not mentioned in the treaty. His Majesty!s Government in the United Kingdom, while taking note that the Egyptian Constitution provides for liberty of conscience and of worship, recognise that this question will in future be the exclusive concern of the Egyptian Government.gjr Egyptian Note.In reply to your note of to-day&apos;s date I have the honour to confirm the record contained in your note of the understandings which have been reached between us with regard to matters arising out of or in connexion with the treaty which has been signed to-day.   These understandings are as follows: [Here insert from &quot; In regard to matters of a military character &quot; to end of British Note.]3. Draft Exchange of Notes in regard to the Reform of the Capitulations.0. British Note.Sir,With regard to the second paragraph of article 10 of the treaty signed to-day, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom recognise that the conditions in which the Capitulations are at present applied as affecting the power of the Egyptian Government to legislate for or to impose taxation on foreigners are no longer consistent with modern conditions.They are prepared to agree that in future any assent which is necessary before Egyptian legislation, including fiscal legislation, is applied to foreigners shall be given by the Legislative Assembly of the Mixed Tribunals, except in the case of legislation relating to the constitution, or jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals themselves, which should not come into force until it has been approved by the Powers. The competence of the Legislative Assembly of the Mixed Tribunals should consist in satisfying itself that the legislation in question is not inconsistent with the principles generally adopted in modern legislation which is applicable to foreigners, and with particular relation to legislation of a fiscal character, that it does not inequitably discriminate against foreigners, including foreign companies.The transfer of the Mixed Tribunals, by consent of the interested Powers, of the jurisdiction now exercised by the Consular Courts which will, of coiu-se, be subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of the annex to article 9 of the treaty, will necessitate the revision of the existing laws relating to the organisation and jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals, including the preparation and promulgation of a new Code of Criminal Procedure. For these purposes His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom would be prepared to accept as a basis the principles which resulted from the discussions which took place on this subject in 1920.It may be difficult for some Powers to agree to the transfer to the Mixed Tribunals of all suits relating to the statut personnel of their nationals. Transfer in the case of these questions would be facultative.  Jurisdiction in such matters
should remain with the consular authorities unless an agreement is made between the Egyptian Government and the foreign Government concerned for its transfer to&apos;the Mixed Tribunals.There are certain matters upon which it will be necessary for agreement to be reached between the Egyptian Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, but it is unnecessary to do more at the moment than mention these subjects.The first is the definition of the word &quot; foreigner &quot; for the purposes of the proposed extension of the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals.The second is the increase in the personnel of the Mixed Tribunals and Mixed Parquet, which will be necessitated by the proposed extension of their jurisdiction.The third is the procedure in the case of pardons or remissions of sentences imposed on foreigners, and also in connexion with the execution of capital sentences imposed on foreigners.g-r Egyptian Note.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of to-day&apos;s date in which you informed me of the general lines upon which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom would be prepared to support the efforts of the Egyptian Government to conclude arrangements with the Powers for the reform of the capitulatory regime.I am happy to state that the Egyptian Government are in general agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom as to the lines on which the reform of the capitulatory system should proceed.As regards the revision of the existing laws relating to the organisation and jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals and the preparation of a new Code of Criminal Procedure, the Egyptian Government recognise that they shall not diverge from the principles generally adopted by modern legislation which is applicable to foreigners.o
