Circulated to the Cabinet by directi rph&quot; fU-cm-tavy of State for Foreign /THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTGERMANY. April 21. 1933.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.IC 3579/319/18] No. 1.Sir H. Rumbold to Sir John Simon. (Received Ajyril 21.) (No. 361.   Confidential.)Sir. Berlin. April 7, 1933.THE supporters and advocates of the Hitler regime base their support on two main arguments. The first of these is that the regime has saved Germany and Europe generally from bolshevism. This is a considerable assumption. Communism has existed in Germany for many years past, and the first Communists sat in the Reichstag soon after the revolution. The seizure of power in Russia by the Bolsheviks obviously gave a stimulus to the German Communist party, and there is no doubt that sums of money were for some time regularly received from Russia for the promotion of the Communist cause in Germany. But communism is as much an economic as a political phenomenon, and the number of Communists in Germany seems to have increased pari passu with the deterioration of the economic situation. Whilst there is no doubt a hard kernel of communism of the Russian variety, it by no means follows that the bulk of the Communist party are as Red as their Russian confreres. It is quite possible that the recruits which the Communists have in the past won from the Social Democratic party may easily be lost again to that party.2. The Communist vote attained its high-water mark in the elections of November 1932, and the Communist representation in the Reichstag was certainly imposing in point of numbers. But it is doubtful whether communism really presented the dangers with which the Hitler party invested it. General Hammerstein, who commands the Reichsheer and with whom I have discussed the subject of communism, certainly did not fear it. although he made no secret of the satisfaction it would give him to deal drastically with the Communist party.3. The second argument used by Hitler&apos;s followers is that the Hitler experiment must be made a success, failing which Germany will be plunged into chaos. This is an argument which is held even by men of sensible views, such as Baron Neurath, but it seems to leave two factors out of account. i.e.. the existence of the Reichsheer and of two large bourgeois parties, namely, the Centre and the Social Democrats. In the event of trouble, the Reichsheer could undoubtedly count on the support of the Stahlhelm. It is true that many persons hold that the Social Democratic party is finally and hopelessly discredited and that no salvation is likely to be forthcoming from the Centre party. In that case a military dictatorship seems the only alternative to the Hitler regime.4. The future development of the Hitler movement is therefore of deep interest, and in this connexion I submit the views of Dr. Klein, the chief editor of the Deutsche A llgemeine Zeitung, who is in close touch with Herr von Papen and whose paper is one of the few remaining organs of the press which maintains a semblance of independence. Dr. Klein&apos;s views are contained in a letter to a friend, copy of which has been communicated to me in strict confidence. He considers that the Nazi movement may follow one of two directions : either it will become more moderate and develop into certainly a rather radical, but still supportable regime, or else and that is more probable the movement will become more and more extreme until it becomes unbearable. Such a development could, in certain circumstances, come about in a few months, and the moment would arrive when energetic counter-action would have to be taken. For such counter-action there are available the Reichswehr and the Stahlhelm, leading to a military dictatorship as a way out. The Reichswehr so far has not identified itself in any way with the Nazi movement. They have resumed their old black-white-red badges, but not the Swastika, nor does a Nazi flag fly from any building of theirs. Of course, there are Nazi cells in the army, and some of the officers sympathise with it. Indeed, the Secretary of State in the Reichswehr stands well with them.  The Reichswehr Minister himself is quite aloof, and there is not the[769 x-1]
slightest doubt that the army would obey Hindenburg&apos;s orders. The latter has hitherto refrained from proclaiming a military state of exception, not only because that would be an extreme measure, but because it is the last resource, and it is held to be better to allow things to take their course for a further period. Among the Stahlhelm there is even greater bitterness against the Nazis than is to be found in the camps of the Left. They are particularly annoyed about the distribution of jobs, of which the Nazis have got 99 per cent, to 1 per cent, of the Stahlhelm. The collision in Brunswick was not caused by the Social Democrats, but by the Stahlhelm. There have been similar conflicts throughout the country, though not so serious as at Brunswick. The Stahlhelm have even approached the Centre with the request to form Stahlhelm groups as a reinforcement. That Hindenburg would not hesitate to impose martial law is to be assumed, for the theatrical x^azis, with their incessant agitation, are foreign to his simple, straightforward military nature.5. Dr. Klein is further of the opinion that, should the time come when the establishment of a. military dictatorship should prove necessary, the question would also arise whether the monarchy should be set up at the same time. The Crown Prince would not be considered, as people do not think him serious enough, but his eldest son is said to be quite sound. The main difficulty is that the Emperor William wants to come back himself and will not allow his son or grandson to mount the throne.6. A thoroughly difficult situation would arise were Hindenburg to die. In that case not only would Hitler&apos;s election to the presidency be likely, but the Nazis want to make Hitler Regent, and have in mind something like Bonaparte&apos;s position as first consul.7. Conflicts with foreign countries will, it is to be hoped, be avoided. It is known that in France responsible people are talking of a preventive war, and those who have recently come from France report that the armament factories are working night and day. There is no doubt that Poland is now being held back by France, but would invade Germany in the case of a preventive war. It is to be doubted whether any French Government would undertake the responsibility for leading the country into war again. In any case, the German Government are determined to avoid conflicts. Hitler has shown his will for peace in his Reichstag speech, and this will be followed by still stronger statements. The Government will even meet France so far as possible in the disarmament question. Moreover, England and Italy are exerting strong pressure on Germany and France at the moment to force them to come to an understanding.I have, &amp;c.HORACE RUMBOLD.
