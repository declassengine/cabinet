RUSSIAN GOODS (IMPORT PROHIBITION) APT, 1953* QUESTIONS FOR DEOTSIOH.If and when it is deoided to give effect to this Aot, there are certain questions which will have to be decided. These fall into two groups -A. What shall be included in any Proclamationissued under Section 1.B. Policy to be adopted by the Board of Trade inissuing licences under Seotion 2oA, PROCLAMATION.Under Section 1 of the Act, a proclamation may prohibit the import either of all Soviet goods, or of particular olasses of Soviet goods.     At first sight, it might appear to be simpler and more consistent with the general purpose of the Act to prohibit the import of all Soviet good3 v/whatever, issuing licences in respect of such classes of good-s as it may appear desirable to admits     There are, however, important reasons for adopting the alternative of including only specific classes of goods in the Proclamation.The administration of an import prohibition i3 necessarily attended by considerable inconvenience to traders, and this inconvenience is by no means confined to those deriving their supplies from the country from which imports are prohibited.     It will be necessary to take steps to ensure that any prohibition is not evaded by consigning Soviet goods to a third couiitry and reconoigning them thence to this country.     In order to prevent such evasion, the Act empowers the Customs to re quire importers;, in case of doubt, to furnish proof of origin in respect of all good3 of a kind covered by prohibition, and such proof may be necessary in the
case of any good3 consigned from countries through whichwere to cover all Soviet goods, it might he necessary to require importers to furnish proof of origin for a very wide range of goods, although in a number of cases the supply derived from Russia would be insignificant; and traders in oertain lines of goods would thus be put to an amount of inconvenience quite disproportionate to the importance of the Russian element in the total imported supply.       in order, therefore, to minimise the inconvenience to traders, it is proposed that any Proclamation should be limited to as few specific classes of goods as possible, consistently with the general object of the Act.After consultation with the various Departments&apos; interested, it is suggested that the following classes of goods should be specified In any Proclamation:such evasion might take place.Thus, if a ProclamationImports from the DcSoSoR.1931   million.Butter      .....**...*..***.**Hheat in grain 0...........-isxrley *********************Cat S ..**.*. ***********Maize * * * o* * *.....**********Poultry and game ***********Raw Cotton * *.....**********petroleum ******************Timber (including sleepers, pltprops and manufactures of timber, that is, plywood and builders&apos; woodwork)  ***2*0 6.6 1.2 0.6 0.1 0.7 2.1 4*17.825.2
These classes of goods represented in 1931 nearly 80^ of all imports from the Soviet Union, and although this percentage can only oe a very rough guide, owing to the remarkably wide variations from year to year in the Soviet supplies of certain goods, it is broadly true to say that the goods selected represent th( bulk of Soviet exports to this country.The principles adopted in making this selection \ were to avoid the inclusion of classes of goods of which the Soviet supply is small, or where there were special reasons for desiring the continuance of Soviet supplies of, e.g., certain raw materials or goods for re-export, in order to obviate undue damage to industry and trade. Notes are appended on the principal classes of goods om.permitted.It is not considered that, in existing conditions of world production, any marked effect should result from cutting off Soviet supplies of thegoods selected for inclusion, with the exception ofitimber and barley.     About 15?u of the softwood consumed in this country is derived from Russia, aim the failure of so important a source of supply may lead to   a rise in the prices of this most important raw material. Moreover, it is alleged that certain grades of timber cannot be obtained in satisfactory qualities from other sources.     Nevertheless the purpose of the Act can hardly be fulfilled without prohibiting timber, upon the proceeds of which the Soviet Government are likely to depend more than ever this year if cereals fail.      The rise in price must be risked, and trhose who allege that special grades of Soviet timber are indispensable for thorn must make out-3-\^K^K^^BtBKBBgHmimmmmmmmnNSmaem^^-...............mmmmamnmm......mmw^w iiiimnn 11 Miinmvtrirf mi illibi iiiiiiii iiiiiiihiiiwiibimiiii ihiuim mi i 111------
their case for a licence.     As regards &quot;barley, between 27?-and 39?! of our imported supplies of barley have been derived from Russia in the last three years, and v/ithout them the price of an important feeding stuff might rise.     It is understood, however, that the Minister of Agriculture is prepared to accept the inclusion of barley with other cereals in the Proclamation as a purely emergency measure.It is suggested that any Proclamation should take effect seven days from the date on which it is made.     This would permit in general the clearance of goods already shipped when the Proclamation appears, but would prevent forestalling.B. LIOFNCPS.A decision is necessary as to the principles by which the Department is to be guided in dealing with applications for licences to import Soviet goods in the event of a Proclamation being issued prohibiting the importation of all, or of certain classes, of Soviet goods.The classes of case likely to arise fall into three group s:-(l) Personal belongings.(2) Goods which have been paid for.(3) Goods needed by traders for special reasons. There will presumably be no objection to the issue of licences in cases of the first class.As regards the second class, it is known that in certain cases advances in respect of future imports have been made by British traders to Soviet organisations.     For instance, if butter is included in a Proclamation, applications may be expected from traders who have made advances in respect of future consignments.     There appears to be good ground for the issue of licences in such cases, although this will not, of course, ensure the shipment of the goods.
0As regardB the third class, there will be cases where it is claimed that a particular class of good for home consumption or for export cannot be produced in satisfactory quality except from materials obtainable only from Soviet Russia.     It is understood, for instance, that oertain kinds of timber are not obtainable from other sources of supply. Each case v/ould have to be considered on it merits but it is suggested that where the claim is established, the goods should be admitted.There will also be cases where Soviet goods are imported for the purpose of re-export, possibly after being subjected to some process in this country.     Goods imported for exportation after transit through the United Kingdom or by way of trans-shipment v/ill be covered by Section l(5), but there will also be cases which do not strictly fall under this provision.     It is suggested that the preservation of the entrepot trade should in general be regarded as a ground for the issue of a licence in such cases.Applications for licences will no doubt be received in respect of cases, not falling within the two classes just mentioned, on the ground that contracts cannot be fulfilled. Mere inability to fulfil a contract will not, it is assumed, be regarded as a sufficient reason for the grant of a licence having regard to the provisions of Section 3 which envisages non-fulfilment and protects the contracting party.There is another type of case, where a trader may have contracted to supply, say, doors, at a price based on the assumption that supplies from Russia would continue to be forth-coming.     It may well be that he could obtain doors from else-v/here of a kind which would enable him to fulfil his contract, but at a price which would involve him in considerable loss. It would appear, however, to be hardly consistent with the
Board of Trade.8th April, 1933,purpose of the Act that a licence-to import should he given where necessary to obviate, or to minimise, losses due to inability to obtain supplies at a price as low as before Russian supplies of the class of goods concerned were shut off.
ANNEX.Notes on certain classes of goods which it is not proposed to prohibit.Bacon   ( 67,000 in 1931).Eggs      ( 84,000 in 1931;   4,000 in 1932).The Russian supplies of both these commodities used tobe quite large, but have recently dropped to a low level.They now represent a trifling proportion of the totalimported supply.    Under the existing bacon scheme, Russiahas not fulfilled her quota of 4,000 cwts a month.    i/hilethe minister of Agriculture agrees that these commoditiesshould not be included within the scope of a purely emergencymeasure, he might v/ish to reconsider the matter ifprohibition should have to be enforced for longer than isanticipated.Canned Salmon   ( 1,861,000 in 1931: 1,566,000 in 19 32).Owing to the cession to Japan of fishing rights inKamchatka after the Russo-Japanese war, 70/o-30;&apos;i of these imports are understood to be really Japanese.    Japan wouldbe the chief sufferer if the import of canned salmon fromthe Soviet Union were prohibited.    Such a step would cause serious difficulty with Japan, who have already drawn attention to their interest in this matter.Sic ins and fur-skins Ti undressed ( 505,000 in 1931:[ 1,074,000 in 1932).-DresseOi furs ,v.nrt skins ( 1,792,000 in. 1931: 456,000 in 1932).There is an important entrepot trade under both theseheadings.    In the case of undressed goods, the value of there-exports exceeds the value of the imports, and though thisis portly due to laisdescription, the trade is certainly of
111great value to this country.    German interests have been trying to capture the trade.Flax and flax tow ( 188,000 in 1931: 662,000 in 1932).This raw material is said to he indispensable tothe linen industry, particularly in bootlund.Bristles ( 126,000 in 1931:  161,00C in 1932).Some of the finest bristles come from Russia:moreover, the trade is largely an entrepot trade.xlatinum ( 214,000 in 1931)This may be employed by the Soviet as a substitute for gold - e.g., to pledge as security - and should presumably be allowed to come in.Carpets ( 110,000 in 1931:  138,000 in 1932).These are probably Oriental carpets which oome overland through Russia.     The trade is largely an entrepot trade.
