HIS DOGUliBNT ISTHE PROPERTY OF HI 3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVEiiNMENT.SSGREJ3T.COPY NO.39104 (331.0 A B I Ni E T.ANGLO - 3 *7BD ISH AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a note prepared in the Board of Trade on the provisional Agreement which has been reached as a result of the negotiations with the Swedish Government.    The Swedish Delegation are telegraphing to their Government for approval of -the Agreement, and in the event of their receiving that approval, I hope I may have authority to agree on behalf of His I-aajesty&apos;s Government.    In that event I should wish to make an announcement, in answer to a Private Notice Question, on Wednesday 12th April in the following terms. -&quot;I am happy to be able to announce that the heads of an Agreement have now been reached with the Swedish Government.    There are still a number of technical points and details of drafting to be settled so that the formal signature and publication of the agreement cannot take place until after Easter.    Until that time I cannot say more than that the Agreement provides for concessions covering a wide range of United Kingdom export trade to Sweden, in return for reductions or conventionalisations of the rates of duty leviable in this country on a range of goods of special interest to Sweden.&quot;V/.R.BOARD OP TRADEApril 11th,  19 33.
PRESENT POSITION OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH SWEDEN. 1*      The Swedish Offer.A. Coal and Coke-     The Swedish Delegation ar&amp; asking their Government to agree to undertakings from a number of industries and Government bodies which would result inan over-all guaranteed per-.-.entggs of 47$ of all Swedish coal importsa     This would mean 1,046,000 additional tons on 1931 import figures (equal to an additional employment at the pit of about 4,200 men).     On 1932 figures the additional tonnage would be 730,000 (2,900 men) but coal purchases in 1932 were probably affected to some extent by the United Kingdom tariff policy, and Sweden&apos;s desire to create a favourable atmosphere for negotiations.     The Delegation will also be prepared to include in the Agreement a general clause under which   the Sweiish Government would undertake to encourage Swedish industries to increase their imports of coke from the United Kingdom. It would also envisage discussions as to the best means of achieving this object.B. Tariff Concessions,     These cover, as to reductions,  723,000 and, as to consolidations,  4,712,000 of United Kingdom imports into Sweden in 1931 ^ 2,500,000 of the latter is consolidation of free entry).     The trade coverod by refusals is  570,000 on 1931 figures^In 1931, total imports into Sweden from the United Kingdom were about  8,000,000 if re-exports and ships are excluded,
(a) The principal reductions of duty offored are:-Article. (1) Cotton Piece Goods.(2) ^ool tissues.Amount of Reduction (per 100 kilo)All-rcund reduction of 10 kroner on cotton goods other than unbleached and undyed (see comment below).Concession of 25% ad valorem 1 stop1&quot; (specific duties on all except the lightest goods to be consolidated, which was the U.K. request).(3) &quot;tool cloth with small Principle of no additional duty for silk content. silk content up to 5% to be recog-nised in a Special Note to the Schedule, though it cannot at present be applied in practice owing to high taxation of silk yarn.      In addition a concession that no specific duty shall exceed 25)u ad valorem;    and specific duty on all except the lightest goods to be consolidated.(4) Oil-Cloth.From 60 to 50 kroner;    the full reduction asked for.(5) Motor Cycles,(6) Motor Cars.Reduction from 20$ to 15% ad valorem per cycle;    the full reduction asked for.Reduction from 20/S to 15% ad valorem per car, on cars up to 1,600 c.c. engine capacity;   no reduction for others (see comment below).(7) Confectionery.From 80 to 50 kroner; reduction asked for.the full(8) Gramophones and Records.(9) Cycle Tyres.Reduction from 100 to 50 kroner; the full reduction asked for.From 160 to 120 kroner;    the full reduction asked for.(10) Leather Footwear.Reduction from 600 to 450 kronor on all shoos weighing 750 grammes or more.     This covers all men&apos;3 and heavy women&apos;s and is the full reduction asked for except that the range is limited.(x)    The figures in this paragraph are taken from the Swedish import returns, converted at 18 kr. to  1.- 2 -
adThe reductions offered on (2),  (3),  (4), (5),  (7), (8), (9) and (10) are tho whole or nearly the whole of those asked for.     On (l) and (6) they are not:-On Cotton Goods (l) the ad valorem incidence of the duties on United Kingdom 1931 imports is about 19 to 22$ and our industry asked for reductions for dyed and printed goods only,&apos; ranging from 20 .kr. to 35 kr. per 100 kilo.    Tho Swedish offer is for an all-over reduction of 10 kr- which Lancashire do not regard -as so satisfactory.On Motor Cars (6) The Swedish offer covers only one of the two categories of cars for which the United Kingdom industry desire concessions in relation to their United States competitors.    The United Kingdom industry is not satisfied with tho Swedish offer but it is quite clear that nothing further will be forthcoming and that the concession is a help to the small United Kingdom car.(b) The tariff consolidations offered cover a wide range of goods.    The important ones cover 24 tariff headings.    Of - the imports covered by refusals half are unbleached cotton piece goods on which it is unlikely that further duties will bo imposed.    The most important other refusals are linen piece goods and iron and steel pipes and tubes *(c) Minor Tariff Concessions.    Apart from the above, there are many minor tariff reductions and consolidations offered by the Swedes-    These cover eighteen headings of the Swedish tariff for reductions and forty-three headings for consolidations -They will no doubt be appreciated by the trades concerned, though their effect individually ie comparatively small.(d) General Effect of Tariff Concessions.    Apart from the statistics shown above no figures can be produced to eva^vtu the Swedish tariff concessions.    United Kingdom industries have refused to givj estimates of probable increases of trade * So far as can be j-idged from the comments of United Kingdom
industries it can at least be said that we shall be assuring the market from the point of view of tariffs for cotton piece goods and high class wool textiles and jute tissues, for cotton and wool yarns and cotton thread, for tinplate and galvanised sheets, for textile machinery, motor cycle engines and some electee-technical apparatus, for sanitary ware, for syrup,  for linoleum and for a number of other minor tradeSoWe may expect an expansion in trade so far as tariff barriers prevent this, for medium and lower grade wool textiles motor cers, motor cycles, leather footwear, gramophones and records, confectionery, and a number of minor trades such as sauces,  cider, rubber upholstery and rubber flooring, Cc    Commercial Travellers&apos; Licence Pees,    The Swedish proposal is for a substantial reduction all round and for a proportionately lower fee for commercial travellers visiting this country for only two weekse    This will mean that commercial travellers who before had to pay 100 kr. or more recently 150 kr0,  for a visit of two weeks will now only have to pay 35 kr.   The existence of the fee has been a substantial cause of grievance in the past.lie THE UNITED KINGDOM OFFER.It should be borne in mind that the main concessions on both industrial and agricultural products, viz especially newsprint, wood pulp, timber of all kinds, paper, bacon, butter and fish, are also of value to Norway and/or Denmark, and also that it is anticipated that further consideration for some or all of these concessions will be obtained in later negotiations with Finland, the Baltic States, and possibly Poland,
V wA. Raw materials and manufactured goods.1. The more important concessions which are being offered to Sweden are:-Wrupping paper.    Reduction from25$ to 16% .Iron and Steel.Timber.Reduction from 33^$ to 20$ or 25$.Reduction from 20$ and 15$ to 10$ for box-boards and certain planed tinb er.This proposal is estimated at involving a loss of employment for 1,000 men directly, and loss of potential employment for many more on the assumption that at the present rate of duty the British industry will gros rapidly.    Loss of Revenue about  50,000. (Also of importance to Norway) .Loss of employment for 600 men.Loss of employment for 200 men.Loss of revenue say  50,000. (also of importance to No nvay) .In addition reductions of duty, involving a loss of employment for some 150 men in all, have been offered   on ball bearings, raw granite (mainly Norway) and wood flour.The removal to the free list of felspar, quartz, and calcium carbide (mainly Norway), ferro chrome, fcrro silicon and charcoal,iron and steel, involves a loss of revenue of some  100,000.    Probably some of those items would be placed on the Free List in any event by recommendation of the Advisory Committee and in the interests of the consuming industries in the United Kingdom.The total cost to us of our concessions to both Norway and Sweden can be estimated as a loss of employment for rather more than 2,000 men and a loss of revenue of some  200,000,2.    Offers of less importance to us which have been made to Sweden are:-(a) Consolidation of free entry for wood pulp, newsprintand pitprops and some other goods of less importance.
0 9 o a(b) Consolidation of the duty of 10 per cent, on hewn,sawn and planed softwoods and other goods of less importance.(c) Consolidation of duty at higher rates on paperboards, and certain articles of lesser importance. 3.    Sweden&apos;s total exports to the United Kingdom in 1931for goods other than food and drink amounted to about  14 m,and some    concession has been asked for regarding rates of duty on goods of which her exports in the same year amounted to slightly under  12 m.The offers which have been made by the United Kingdom may be sub-divided as follows (excluding agricultural products and fish - about  3,260,000 for which see below):-B.   Agricultural products.      Sweden is not primarily interested in the supply of agricultural products to the United Kingdom and the Delegation has stated that, generally speaking, their Government will bo satisfied with the safeguards given to the Danes.   Swedish imports of the agricultural products covered were about  3,200,000 in 1931.Bacon and Ham-    Consolidation of free entry has been offered,. As regards quotas the Swedish Delegation have indicated that they will be satisfied with a general clause according to Sweden opportunity for discussion in order to ensure a fair quota to Sweden prov/xted that no other country except Denmark is accorded by Treaty a minimum percentage of foreign imports. Butter.     Consolidation of the 15/- a cwt. duty (fixed at Ottawa) has been pffered.    The Swedish Delegation have agreedImports from Sweden 1931.  .Maintenance on the Free List - about Consolidation of duty O 10% &quot;Consolidation of duty at rates3,500,000 2,500,000higher than 10&quot;? Reduction of duty No concession offered850,000 3,600,000 2,000,000
c 4(with much reluctance) to accept a minimum quota of 185,000 cwts. EgPis.     Consolidation of the Ottawa duties has been offered. The Swedish Delegation have asked for most-favoured-nation treatment in the matter of quotas.Other Agricultural Products.      Swedish requests for consolidation of United Kingdom duties on Cheese, lard, tinned and canned meat aand pork products, cr^em, condensed milk and oats and oat products, have been refused as their interest in these items as compared with other countries is insignificant0   Sweden will receive a concession of free entry for hay and straw:.(now 10% ad valorem) which is bring given to Norway, and conventionalisa-tion of United Kingdom duties on certain seeds and on horse-radish.C.   Fish.      The United Kingdom policy involves, generally speaking, v a reduction of foreign supplies of fish by 10 per cent, and aconsolidation of the United Kingdom fish duties.    Sweden has been allocated an annual quota of 43,000 cwts. for all fish, and tho Delegation has accepted this figure.The above offers may be summarised as follows Swedish offer,.046.000 1.    Coal.    Guarantee to purchase 47$ of total Swedish importsiditionalpns. from this country.   Equivalent on 1931 figures to an additional1,200in), 4,200 men.2,    Reductions or modifications of duty on goods the import of which into Sweden from the United Kingdom in 1931 was 123,000    723,000,    These include reductions in such important industries as cotton and wool textiles, motor cars, motor cycles and foot-wear.    The amount of increased employment cannot be estimated, but some of the reductions are substantial and should lead to increased trade.3.    Consolidation of free entry on present duties on goods 712,000  the import of which into Sweden from the United Kingdom in 1931 was  4,712,000.
a 54.    Substantual reduction of the fee levied on Commercial Travellers visiting Sweden.5.   No concession offered on requests covering  570,000 of United Kingdom imports in 1951. United Kingdom offer.1.    Reductions of duty on industrial products, the importsof which into the United Kingdom from Sweden in 1951 wereS3,600,000      5,600,000.    Two at least of these (iron and steel and (2,000 men)wrapping paper) entail substantial reductions of duty.    The loss of employment consequent on the reductions of duty offered to both Sweden and Norway is estimated at rather more than 2,000 men.2.   Consolidation of free entry for present duties on  6,650,000     industrial products,  the import of which into the United Kingdom from Sweden in 1951 was  6,650,000.5.   Consolidation of duties (but restriction of imports) 03,300,000     in the case of agricultural products and fish, the imports of which into tho United Kingdom from Sweden in 1931 were  3,300,000.4.    No concession offered on requests covering  2,000,000 of Swedish imports in 1931,It is not possible to make any direct comparison between the two offers but on coal alone the Swedish offer represents a reasonably certain additional employment of over 4,000 men.    The loss of employment and effect on revenue in the United Kingdom cannot be estimated with any exactness and must relate to the whole of the concessions given to both Norway and Sweden.    The best conjectures that can be made are reductions in employment for something over 2,000 men and  200,000 loss of revenue.    Of the revenue some  100,000 represents loss on materials of a kind not made in any extent in the United Kingdom which are being placed on
the free list, and it is probable that in any event the duties on these materials would on the recommendation of the Imports Duties Advisory Committee be removed in the interests of United Kingdom industries-The amount of trade covered by concessions on the United Kingdom side in greater than that covered on the previous side for a variety of reasons.    In the first place the volume of imports from Sweden greatly exceeds our exports to Sweden, and consists to a substantial extent of raw materials and semi-manufactured products required by United Kingdom industry.    In the second place the Swedish concession on coal is different in kind from any concession we are giving.     Further, vie are already restricting or are proposing to restrict Swedish imports of the main agricultural products and fish.The Swedish offer covers a wide range of United Kingdom exports and contains something for a large number of industries in addition to the main concession on coal.The concessions we are offering in exchange are no doubt substantial and will lead to considerable protests in the case of iron and steel and wrapping paper, but I am satisfied that they are adequately paid for, particularly having regard to the fact that an agreement covering many articles common to both countries has also been negotiated with Norway.Board of Trade,11th April, 1933.
