&quot; DO-3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BglgAMMIC MAJESTY&apos; S QOVSHNMSNT.RET. -----^.105(53).C A B I N E T.ANGLO-ARGENTINE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. Memorandum by the President of the 3oard of Trade.I am   able to inform my colleagues that these negotiations have resulted in provisional agreement being reached and I hope it v/ill be possible for representatives of the tv/o Governments to initial the Heads of Agreement today.The main points of the Agreement are three: -(l) The provision   of sterling exchange for United Kingdom requirements.(2) Undertakings as to the importation of meat from Argentina into the United Kingdom.(3) Proposals regarding the tariff treatment of United Kingdom goods in Argentina and regarding the tariff treatment of Argentine products in United Kingdom.The Argentine Government also make a - declaration oftheir benevolent intentions regarding the treatment of theBritish railways and other public utility companies operating in Argentina.As to exchange, my colleagues will be glad to learn thatthe proposals are acceptable to the City, and that theinterests of British traders doing business v/ith theArgentine have been fully protected.    The Argentine Governmentoffer for the purpose of meeting applications for currentremittances from the Argentine to the United Kingdom the full amount of the sterling exchange arising from the sale cf&quot;Argentine products in the United Kingdom after deduction of a reasonable sum, which has been agreed upon, towards the
payment of the service of the Argentine foreign debt due in countries other than the United Kingdom;  the distribution of exchange among various classes of claimants to be made according to certain priorities.    Provision is made for a cash payment to all the holders of small amounts of frozen balances and, in respect of the larger amounts, the Argentine Government v/ill offer to make an issue of sterling bonds.As regards meat His i-.,ajesty&apos;s Government assure the Argentine Government that they would only wish to reduce imports of Argentine chilled beef below the Ottawa levels in the interests of the home farmer:  they do not intend that any reduction of chilled beef up to 10.H.- should be made up by imports from other countries of either chilled or frozen beef.    If it should be absolutely necessary to reduce chilled beef by more than 10$ in any year below the Ottawa levels in order to secure a remunerative price, the United Kingdom Government v/ill consult the Governments of the chief meat exporting countries,  including the Dominions, with a view to arranging that the additional reductions shall apply equally to imports of Dominion frozen meat.    With regard to mutton and lamb, His Majesty&apos;s Government oonfine themselves to stating that they would not allow the meat market to be swamped.Arrangements will be made for the Argentine Government to appropriate for public undertakings, if they so desire, a proportion not exceeding 15$ of the meat exported from Argentina to the United Kingdom, subject to assurances that the meat v/ill be efficiently marketed in the United Kingdom.His Majesty&apos;s Government declare their readiness to join, if desired, in an inquiry into the financial and
economic structure of the industry with a view to seeing how the producer can he assured a reasonable share of the prices paid for meat.Tariffs.    The special mission under Dr.  Rcca was not provided \tith expert assistance and it was therefore impossible to work out details..    There will thus be a supplementary Agreement containing provisions in regard to duties levied on United Kingdom goods in Argentina and on Argentine goods in the United Kingdom, the details to be worked out as quickly as possible.    In general the Argentine Government intend to remit       the duties in force in 1930 on goods of substantial interest to United Kingdom trade, the 1930 duties being substantially lower than those now in force.    They also intend to make various reclassifications in their tariff headings, designed to facilitate the imports of goods of types which are of particular interest to the United Kingdom.    The United Kingdom offers to consider sympathetically conventionalisation of the existing duties on or free entry of certain -argentine products namely meat, wheat, maize, linseed, butter, eggs, v/ool, bran and pollard, sharps and middlings, premier jus, unrefined tallow, quebracho extract and horse-hair.    V/e also state our intention not to regulate imports quantitatively of any of these commodities except meat, butter and eggs.    In the event of this supplementary agreement ;iot being concluded within the next four months, it will be open to the United Kingdom to denounce at short notice the whole Agreemai t.I therefore ask my colleagues for authority to conclude an Agreement on these general lines in the event of the Argentine Government&apos;s giving its acceptance.    In that eventM
I would propose to make a short announcement in answer/er to a private notice Question on the following lines? -&quot;I am happy to announce that a provisional agreement has been reached between the Government of the Argentine Republic and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.Documents have to-day been initialled by His Excellency Dr. Roca,  the Vice-president of the Argentine Republic and myself.    Formal instruments in the nature of a full 1&apos;treaty are in course of preparation and will be signed after Easter.The general lines of the Agreement are that His Majesty&apos;s Government have given certain undertakings as to the quantities of Argentine chilled beef which may be imported into the United Kingdom which the Argentine government have given satisfactory undertakings as to the provision of sterling exchange to meet United Kingdom requirements.    There will also be a supplementary Agreement, to be concluded as soon as possible, relating to duties levied on United Kingdom goods in Argentina and on Argentine goods in the United Kingdom.I am satisfied that the Agreement is of marked advantage and will further strengthen the ties uniting the two countries.W.R.Board of Trade,13th April, 1935.
