I desire to ask for authority to accept this Agreement on behalf of His Kajesty1s Government, and I would wish to make an announce-ment, probably in answer to a private notice Question, on wednesday 12th April in the following terms:-&quot;I am happy to be able to announce that the heads of an agreement have now been reached with the Norwegian Government.      There are still a number of technical points and details of drafting to be settled so that the formal signature and publication of the agreement cannot take place until after Easter.      Until that time I cannot say more than that the Agreement provides for concessions covering a wide range of United Kingdom export trade to Norway, in return for reductions or consolidations of the rates of duty leviable in this country on a range of goods of special interest to Norway&quot;.-7.R.&quot;) C)COPY NO:   &quot; *&apos;Board of Trade, 11th April, 1933.
SECRET cPRESENT POSITION OF TRADE NKGO IT ATION3 with NORWAY,, (11TH APRIL, 19&apos;33)0 The Norwegian Offer.A. Coal and Coke.1. In 1932, total imports of coal into Norway amounted to 2,032,000 tons,  of which 43ft,  or 875,000 tons, was supplied by the United Kingdom.   The Norwegian Delegation propose by means of voluntary arrangements in respect of State and industrial supplies to guarantee an increase in the United Kingdom share to 65j 0     This would mean an additional 450,000 tons,  . (employment for 1,800 more men at the pit) over 1932.   The above figures may be regarded as minima,  since if particular industries use more British coal it will be necessary as a matter of trade organisation for increased quantities to be used for general purposes.As regards coke, in 1924 the United Kingdom supplied 93ft of the Norwegian imports, but the percentage has declined in subsequent years and there is now a fear of intensive Belgian and Dutch competition.   The United Kingdom percentage in 1932 was approximately 73 and the Norwegian Delegation propose that arrangements shall be made to guarantee a percentage of 75 during the period of the Agreement.    On the basis of the 1932 figures 75% means 370,000 tons.B. Tariff Concessions;,2. The latest Norwegian detailed import figures are for the year 1930. In that year imports credited to the United Kingdom were valued at  15,140,000 of which new ships and boats accounted for  6,880,000,  the balance being  8,260,000 Ships and boats enjoy free entry and on the advice of the United Kingdom
interests we have not made any request in regard to them. v,e have asked for concessions on 60% of the balance of our trade, and the Norwegian Delegation offer ins concessions on 53/s, though not in all cases to the full extent we desired. The principal items on which our requests have been refused are gramophones and records, and syrup.3.   Reductions of duty are offered on trade amounting to  1,032,000 in 1930;    conventionalisation of duties on trade amounting to  566,000, and conventionalisation of free entry on trade amounting to  2,755,000.     These offers will mean there-fore reduced duties or a bar to new or increased duties on total United Kingdom trade amounting to  4,353,000.Reductions of duties are offered on 26 items, the principal articles being:-Imports     Approximate average ad credited &apos;   valorem incidence of to U.K.       Present j         Proposed&quot; ^in&apos; 1950. .     duty.    j__duty.bton yarns, single, unbleached . printed, dyed and bleached cotton piece goods....................erproof clothing .............le carpets .....................ol piece goods of cheaper kinds ol hosiery ....................147,0009%17% to iei%18%/o332,000 20$20,000  i      23%22,000  :      28%       j 22l$191,000xlUp to 70% jAdval &quot;stop1 of 30$ 50,000  i      30%       i 27%%x   Wool piece goods of all kinds. &quot;Conventionalisations of duty are offered on 10 items, the principal articles being:-&quot;t Imports I credited - to U.K. in 1930.!

Conventionalisations of free entry are offered on 22 items, the principal articles being:-Imports credited to the United Kingdom in 1930,  Coal,  coke and cinders (still under discussion)............ .   1,900,000Tin plates and galvanisedShOetS    a... ......... v.. 265j 000V/ire rope and fencing......... 75,0004,   A request for a specially favourable tariff classification of motor cars has been refused but it is possible that the Norwegian Government may later in the year reduce the duty on all cars and motor cycles from 45$ to 36$ ad valorem.5,   General Effect of Tariff Concessions.     Apart from the statistics shown above no figures can be produced to evaluate the Norwegian Tariff concessions:   United Kingdom industries are not prepared to give estimates of probable increases of trade. The principal classes of goods affected are set out above. The 30$ ad valorem &quot;stop&quot; for wool piece goods gives us a concession which the United Kingdom industry has pressed for as a matter of importance,  and claims will mean increased trade. The present average rate of duty on cotton goods is about 20 per cent,j    on the major portion of the trade we shall secure reductions of l $ to 3$,  and on the remainder an assurance that  % the duty cannot be increased.   Yfrrile we shall not obtain on cotton goods concessions to the extent that our industry desires we shall secure stability for the whole trade and also slightly lower rates over the greater part of it.   The other reductions of duty, though small in some cases, are a step in tho right direction and will no doubt be appreciated by the industries concerned,i-3-
The proposed conventionalisations of free entry or of existing duties cover a fairly wide field.    In a number--of--casesf it must he admitted, now or increased duties are unlikely, hut the stabilisation of free entry for sewing machines, rubber sheets hose etc., tin plates and galvanised sheets,  iron and steel wire rope, and certain classes of textile machinery, among other goods must be regarded as of value while an assurance that the present comparatively reasonable duties will not be increased on such goods as linen and hemp cloth, whisky and gin,  iron pipes and fittings and linoleum should give considerable satisfaction to the manufacturers concerned.C. Commercial Travellers&apos; Licence Fees0 The present fee is 100 Kr. for 30 days.   The Norwegian Delegation offer 50 Kr. for 15 days, a more usual period for our,, travellers, and exemption from the fee for directors and principals of companies and firms with local agents in Norway0 These should be useful concessions, though we asked for a lower fee.Do Sales Prices and Labelling of Whisky.(1) A reduction of l/- to l/6d per bottle in the Sales Pricesof Whisky fixed by the State Monopoly.    This is a usefulconcession which was pressed for by the Whisky Association.(2) A small concession in regard to labelling of blendedspirits is to be accorded.II. UNITED KINGDOM OFFER.A. Raw Materials and Manufactured GoodsP1. Norway&apos;s total exports to the United Kingdom in 1931of goods other than food and drink amounted to  6,700,000, andsome concession has been asked for regarding rates of duty on goods of which her exports in the same year amounted to 6,400,000   .
2.    For the present purpose, the offers which have beenmade by the United Kingdom may be classified as follows:-Imports from Norway,  1951. liaintenance on the Free List    about  ..... 2,200,000Consolidation of Duty at 10% ............ 1,500,000Consolidation of Duty at Rateshigher than 10%....................... 330,000Reduction of Duty ....................... 1,800,000No Concession Offered ................... 500,000Free List.3.    The most Important of the goods for which free entry has been promised are wood pulp, newsprint and pit props.    Only in the case of newsprint is there any likelihood that we should in any event wish to enforce a duty. Consolidation of 10% Duty.The important items here are shewn, sawn and planed softwood aluminium and zinc.     Any increase of duty on these goods is unlikely.     We are also offering consolidation of the present duty of 10/4 on cod liver oil, if the provision relating to cod liver oil in the Ottavra Agreement with Newfoundland does not come into force. Consolidation of duty at rates higher then 10%.5.    The most Important item to Norway is paper boards. An offer has been made that the duty shall not exceed 20%.    The present duty is 15?$, but the I.D.^..C. are considering an application for an increase in the duty.     The duty on granite setts and curbs,  (15%), is fixed by the agreement with India. Reductions of duty.6.    Goods for which a reduction of duty is offered cover a substantial part of Norway&apos;s trade, and include various classes of wrapping paper (from 25% to , writing paper and tissuepaper (from 20%&apos; to 16^/3%), certain planed timber and boxboards, (from 20% or 15% to 10%), telegraph poles, calcium carbide, ferro chrome, forro silicon, nitric acid and nickel (from 10$ to Free List).

No concession offered.7.    Important items of trade are miscellaneous manufactures of r&quot;ood and timber,  and printing paper (other than news).

r 9(b) Whalo Oil.If South Africa agrees to waive her right under the Ottawa Agreement to a 10$ duty on foreign whale oil, we will accord free entry for whale oil and hardsnod whale oil provided that Norway accords concessions in regard to the duty treatment of certain British Colonial products to the satisfaction of the Colonial Office.      It is understood that the Norwegian interests will make arrangements with the South African whale oil interests which will enable the Union to waive their right.(S)    Cod Liver Oil.Conventionalisation of the present duty of 10$ if the provision in the Ottewa Agreement with Newfoundland relating to cod liver oil does not (?,*5iae    into force.(d)   Pish and Fish Products.(i) Conventionalisation of present duty of 10% ad valoremon(a) all fresh fish and salted fish, including fresh andsalted herrings (except shell fish other than prawns);(b) fish msal (except herring meal) and guano;(c) canned herring and canned brisling;(ii) Free entry for herring meal.(iii) Reduction of duty on prawns from 30$ ad valorem to 10$ ad valorem.(iv) A drawback on export of dry salted fish of the duty paid in respect of fresh fish or wet salted fish used in the manufacture thereof.(v) Imports of all fish, except shell fish and canned fish, to be restricted to 90$ of the average of the quantities imported in the three years 1930/1932.     This will mean quotas for Norway of 240,000 cwts. for white fish and 500,000 cwts. for herrings.In 1931 total imports of fish from Norway were valued at  1,685,000.- ID -
(i) Free entry for hay and straw and bilberries, (ii) An undertaking that, so long as imports of bacon and ham, butter, cheese, eggs and poultry continue to be in insignificant quantities His Majestyfs Government will endeavour to arrange that any quantitative regulation applied in this country shall not affect imports from Norway.&quot; . III.    General Conclusions.The coal concessions made by Norway should mean increased employment for some 1,800 men, and the coke concessions will chock the falling off in employment of men now producing supplies for the Norwegian market. The concession offered by Norway on wool textiles is one which has been pressed hard by the United Kingdom industry as a matter of importance, and will,  it is claimed, mean increased trade.   As regards cotton goods, while we have not obtained concessions to the full extent our industry desires, we have secured stability for the whole trade, and   also   slightly lower rates over the greater part of it.      The other reductions of duty, goes small in some cases,- are a step in the right direction, and will no doubt be appreciated by the industries concerned;.    The conventionalisations of free entry or of existing duties in Norway cover a wide field and should prove valuable and give considerable satisfaction to the United Kingdom manufacturers concerned.The concessions on commercial travellers feej   should help our interests who have pressed for&apos;years for a step of this kind, while the reduction of the Monopoly Sales Prices of whisky removes a grievance of the Whisky Association.
