(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 01? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.       -   &apos;SECRET.CP. 114(33).. CABINET. INDIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.The monthly appreciation from the Government of India, which I circulate herewith, may seem, at any rate at the beginning, to give a rather depressing account of the reception of the Vvhite Paper in India.     I gather, however, from what the Viceroy tells me in his lettersana from other sources, that a good, deal of the criticism is not to be taken at its face value, and that there are not really any grounds for being disappointed at its reception.S.K.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated 25th April, 1955, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.In the press, on the platform and in the Legislature, the V/hite Paper has &quot;been subjected to most unfavourable criticism.    The main points on which the attack has been concentrated have been the extent of the special powers conferred upon the Governor-General and the Governors, the retention in the hands of the Secretary of State of the control of the All-India Services and of recruitment for the Indian Civil Service and Indian Police: the financial restrictions; in particular, the long list of non-voteable items of expenditure, the appointment of a Financial Adviser by the Governor-General, and finally the proposal to establish a Railway Board &quot;by the Constitution Act. Doubts have also been expressed about the date of the inauguration of the Federal constitution which is represented as being hedged in by impossible conditions.That the constitutional proposals have been condemned by all classes of political-minded Indians might be held to indicate that a constitution based on jthem might have little chance of success but it must be remembered that the Indian press and the Nationalist politicians tend at all I7im.es to indulge in destructive criticism of any constitutional proposals emanating from Government, as approval might be construed as unpatriotic.    The attacks have been intensified in the present instance by a desire to neutralise the views of extreme Conservative opinion in England and the belief that the louder the criticism the greater the possibility of improving the bargain.      Little
attention has &quot;been devoted to the very important franchise proposals.    Pew have sought to argue that the scheme, as a whole, is not &quot;based on the decision of the Round Table Conference.To estimate the reception ofthe White Paper it is necessary to look below the surface, and an attempt is made in this appreciation to estimate the views of some of the chief political parties and groups in India.The attitude of Congress towards the White Paper might he held to be indicated &quot;by one of the resolutions said to have been moved at an abortive Congress Session recentlj/ held in Calcutta, to which reference is made below.    This was to the effect that &quot;Congress hold that no constitution framed by        British Government, while it is engaged on a campaign of repression deliberately initiated against national spirit, can be worthy of consideration by or acceptable to people of India.&quot; Though this uncompromising attitude represents no doubt the official view of Congress, beneath the surface there are indications of a growing feeling in favour of abandoning unconstitutional methods and of utilising the power which the new Constitution will offer. In spite of the abstention of Congress, the process of constitution-making goes on, and the new Constitution is rapidly approaching. These facts are not lost on the Eight Wing of Congress.   In this connection it is interesting that Mr. Rangaswami Iyengar, a Right Wing Congressman, who, although he has never supported civil disobedience movement, is yet a close friend of Mr. Gandhi, has accepted an invitation to the Joint Select Committee, although he had refused to attend the Third Round Table Conference.The Liberals have generally concentrated their attacks on the points already mentioned, but they have
been careful to ignore the suggestion made by Congress supporters that the scheme should be rejected in toto, and that they should refuse to co-operate in further constitution discussions.   They will devote themselves to a concerted effort to secure removal of what they regard as the more objectionable features, but even if this is not successful, it appears probable that many hold the view recently enunciated by the President of the Liberal Federation, that &quot;even apoor constitution may work and yield results if a strong and united party in the country, with its root among the masses, is bent upon extracting from it the utmost that it v/ill yield&quot;.The All-India Muslim Conference has criticised the scheme on conventional lines, and in particular advocated curtailment of the powers of Governors, the grant of more seats to Muslims, the effective representation of Muslims in the public services and the Indianisation of the Army in a fixed time.    Many Muslim speakers, however, in provincial councils and in assemblies, though repeating these criticisms, have at the same time admitted the necessity of &quot;safeguarding&quot; under present conditions.The reception of the proposals in British India is thus not unexpected; no one is satisfied, but few are prepared to reject a scheme which is recognised as a great advance and which is capable of improvement.Some mention must be made of the attitude of the Princes as expressed at a recent session of the Chamber. In general it may be said that they favoured Federation with adequate safeguards; they were prepared to authorise their representatives to carry on further negotiations in London in order to secure these and reserved their final opinion till full details of scheme   were known. Opposition, however, was voiced by Jam Sahib of Nawanagar, whose
t*X A o4.sudden and tragic death is a loss to India, and &quot;by some of the Kathiawar States.The 47th Annual: Session of Congress was staged to tak* place in Calcutta on March 31st and April 1st.    Both in Calcutta and Bengal itself it excited little attention; Prom other Provinces a comparatively small number of delegates endeavoured to attend.    Some of them were prevented by local Governments from leaving their Province; others, including Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Mr. Aney, the President, were detained as soon as they reached Bengal.According to Congress figures only about 1,200 filtered through to Calcutta, of whom the greater number came from Bengal itself (300), the United Provinces (600) and Bihar (200); none of the more distant Provinces sent more than 30. Some of these delegates were arrested before the date of Session and on 1st April some 800 persons tried to hold the Session in a central place in Calcutta.   Attempts were made to read resolutions and copies of these resolutions and of speeches which Malaviya intended to deliver in support of them were distributed.    These resolutions reiterated and endorsed independence and civil disobedience resolutions passed at a previous Session and included also resolutions rejecting unread the white Paper, to which reference has already been made.    The delegates were without difficulty arrested or dispersed; no demonstrations were made in support of them and no further attempts to hold Session were made.    The majority of those who had been arrested were released shortly afterwards; Malaviya was set free on 2nd April and proceeded to Calcutta, where his arrival was unnoticed.The session may thus be said to have proved a complete fiasco; and though full credit must be given to the Government
5.of Bengal and the other Governments for the effective action taken, the result shows clearly how Congress methods and policy have lost their hold on the country.Apart from this, Congress activity has been almost negligible during the last month.    It was reported that an attempt would be made to hold provincial Congress meetings, but so far no such attempt has been made.A brief reference must be made to further proceedings of the Legislative Assembly during the session which lasted from beginning of February till Easter.    The Assembly has, on the whole, supported the policy of the Government both in political and financial matters. A motion criticising Governments policy in preventing the Congress Session was defeated.The resolution advocating the release of Gandhi and other political prisoners was talked out, as those who supported it were apprehensive of forcing it to a decision.    On the financial side no important cuts were made in Budget estimates, and the Finance Bill was passed with only one minor modification, the reduction of the rate of income-tax on lowest paid assessees; motions to exempt these assessees entirely and to reduce the rate of postage were rejected.    Other Bills of some importance which were passed without serious opposition included a Bill to make incomes, derived from foreign securities and brought into India, liable to Indian Income-tax, and a Bill to empower Government to take action to prevent dumping.Of the private Members&apos; Bills, the last appreciation referred to the Temple Entry Bill which, as anticipated, made no further progress.    The reformers appear to have
lost something of their initial enthusiasm, while orthodox feeling has been strongly consolidated against . the measure.    A motion to circulate a Bill to exempt Muslims from the Child-Marriage Restraint Act, which was passed with much enthusiasm a few years ago, was only rejected by a very small majority, of which a large part consisted of Government votes.    There are signs that public opinion is growing against interference by Legislature in matters which fall within the domain of religion.
