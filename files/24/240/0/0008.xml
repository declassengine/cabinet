THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.CABINET.Copy No3?a   a   *   *   *CP.108(33).PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND DISTRESSED AREAS. Memorandum &quot;by Minister of Health.In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet (Conclusion 26(33)2) I make the following suggestions as to the manner in which I should deal with Government policy in the Censure debate on Wednesday.     As to the permanent plan, I suggest that I should make the following statement:-&quot;After Easter the Government will introduce a Bill dealing on a national basis with the problem of assistance for those who are in need of assistance, including   those who, having been insured against unemployment, are no longer so insured.I cannot at this time anticipate the contents of the Bill in detail:   but I can give the following broad outline of the leading principles on which the Bill will be based.     The essence of the matter is that we have to   provide   for large numbers ef persons who, seeking work, are unable to find it, and for whom even on the most hopeful calculations unemployment is not likely to be a merely fleeting evil.     Meanwhile, they suffer from the deteriorating effects of idleness. To mitigate that evil as far as possible, it will be a primary purpose of the Bill to make a close connection between the work of giving help in money, and the work of promoting the physical and mental welfare of the unemployed     and in particular of providing protection against   the ill-effects of idleness by training oooupation and recreation.
As to administration, it is recognised that the increasing hurden of work on local authorities, the lack of uniformity in local standards, and the fact that by far the greater part of the cost is already borne by the Exchequer, - that all these circumstances require a greater measure of national supervision and control.     The Bill will establish such a measure of control.      In particular, it will redistribute and define the functions of the local authorities and the central government in relation to assistance from public funds, whether the funds of local authorities or the Exchequer.     One of the bases of this redistribution of responsibility between local authorities and the central government will be that the central government should accept responsibility, both administrative and financial, for assisting all the able-bodied who need assistance.The acceptance of this responsibility by the central government will necessitate a readjustment of the present block grant paid to the local authorities by the State, since they will be relieved of a liability to which they have hitherto been subject.At the same time I may say that we shall take the occasion of these financial readjustments to make some allowance on a regular basis for the special necessities   of what are commonly described in this connection as the distressed areas&quot;.These observations have reference to the permanent plan which the Government have in view for
6^dealing with the problem.     The bringing of such a plan into affect must take time and   meanwhile there is the claim for an early measure of assistance for the areas hardly pressed by the burden of poor relief.     Last Autumn I accepted a suggestion as to this problem proposed to me on behalf of those areas themselves, and I undertook to obtain the concurrence of the Associations of Local Authorities and of the London County Council for the antedating of the investigation of the working of the unemployment factor in the block grant formula under the Local Government Act, 1929. I proceeded with the collection of the necessary statistical material and obtained the nomination of representatives of the Associations and of the London County Council to undertake that investigation.     At that stage the Report of the Royal Commission on the Unemployment Insurance Scheme was submitted to the Government.     That Report dealt at length with the problem of persons no longer entitled to unemployment benefit and still needing public assistance.     Accordingly it had a vital bearing on the major difficulty of the distressed areas and the special course of action, which had been proposed to me to meet that difficulty, had of necessity to be deferred until the Government had considered the whole problem and come to the conclusions as to it which I have already outlined.Now that those conclusions have been formed,  it is possible to advance this matter a further stage. Accordingly, after further discussion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I propose to deal with the immediate needs of the distressed areas, as compared with the Government&apos;3 permanent plan, by a statement as follows:-
&quot;The Government now propose to meet the immediate needs of the distressed areas by carrying to e. conclusion as quickly as may be the investigation of the working of the unemployment factor in the block grant formula.     They trust -that the more fortunate areas will be found to be ready, as a purely emergency measure of a temporary character, to make some contribution out of their share of the block grant for the first year of the second fixed grant period (1933-34) towards helping the hard-pressed areas. The Government would then propose on their part to bring a greater measure of relief to the distressed areas by providing an additional contribution from the Exchequer equivalent to one-half of the sum which they anticipate may reasonably be provided for those areas by the less heavily burdened local authorities&apos; through a suitable modification of the distribution of the block grant.&quot;(Intld.)     E.H.Y.11th April. 1933.
