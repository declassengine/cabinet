The output was 79^5 of the average weekly output in 1913 and 87fo of that in 1929aThe average employment for the 13 weeks ending March 25th wa3 788,100 a3 compared with 836,500 in the corresponding period in the previous yeara     The output per r.ian wa3 5*48 tons which was 0ol6 tons highereGoal exports for the two month ended February 1933 compared with the corresponding period in 1932,  showed a decrease of 40^,000 tons, whiJe bunker coal showed a decrease of 270,000 ton So   A one 11  ir.cfec.ye wa3 shown in exports from the east Coast  (ports to lew  amber), hat elsewhere, end particularly in the South  ales, flumber and North Eastern Districts, there were decreases^       Exports to Finland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, France, UoS^A. and Canada increased, tut exports to other countries, particularly Germany, tho Irish Free State, The Netherlands and Brazil decreasedoIn Scotland and on tho North East coast, the export business has wealcened recent Ly owing to the uncertain outcome of the trade negotiations with Finland and the Scandinavian countriesoIron and Steel. - Conditions remained fairly steady during March.     The export market was affected by the attempts to re-constitute the International Steel Cartel.     It is expected that if an agreement is reached, continental export prices v/ill ri se.The home demand for pig iron improved somewhat but orders for semi-finished steel were small.     Continental competition in the latter material is nor; negligible.On the North East Coast 18 furnaces were in blast at the end of March, compared with 15 at the beginning. Hessrso Dorman Long are expected to sign the contract for the new Danish bridge shortly, end the North East Coast also hopes to obtain the steel contract for the Fulham por,-er Station.In Scotland and South Wale s there has been little improvement.In Sheffield, the demand for special alloy steels has increased.     The demand from the motor industry is steady end some benefit has been felt from the recent placing of Admiralty contracts for shippingsShipping and Shipbuilding. - The position i3 substantially unonangea.     The index 6T shipping freights has fallen to 75*31 compared with 87o31 a year ago,   (1915 = 100).     The tonnage laid up on lot January, 1933, was 1,971,101 tona compared with 1,9.66y417 tons the year before.At the end of March, the tonnage of merchant shipping under&quot; construction in this comtry shows an increase of 26,904 tons a.tf compared with the -very low figures for tlio previous quarter;    tot tho present total of 252,401 tons is 120,572 less than at the end of March 1932.   The increase noted above iii, however, the first to be recorded since March, 1930*
Electrical Industry. - The output of electricity by author! 3e d-undor takings in liar oh 1933 v/aa 1,180 million units, an increase of 6*3$ on March 193 2.Tho peroontu.se. of prodxictive oapacity for plant in use rose during the month owing to orders for heavy plant from-South Africa and India.The indices (1920 = 100) of orders received for heavy plant v;ore Home 88, compared with 46 in Harch of last year, and Export 65 compared with 112o       Orders for light material have declined owing to increased imports of carbons, batteries, end scientific electrical instrument saMotcr mdugtry. - Conditions in the home market remain steacCyl Commercial vehicle construction is being slowed dov.m by uncertainty arising out of the Saltor Report0Export to Australia is hampered by the excessive ditty on bodies and panels, designed to foster tho body-building plant at Adelaideo      ,In Canada motor buses have until recently been excluded from the Free List but the new Canadian budget gives free entry to British motor busesoMachine Tools* - There i3 no material change in the hone marJcet.     Exports during liar oh 1953, were 2155; 471 compared with  504,926 in March 1932.     Exports to Russia were  .(00,, 682 compared with . 233,990.     It is stated that no further Russian order3 are now being placcda     Imports of machine tools ore 3mall.Wool * - On the whole, machinery has not been quite so fully employed during I larch as a year ago,  but the output of merino tops remains large and the combing section i3 still fairly well employed.Exports of tops, and of woollen and vrorsted. yams and tissues in February were all 3lightly higher than in the previous year.An organisation embro-influencing 90f3 of the commission combing industry has been formed under the name of the Wool Combers1 Mutual Association Limited, to buy up recluiidant machinery and to eliminate price-cutting.     An attempt is also being mode to prevent price-outting in the piece-dyeing and finishing trade.Cotton. - The closing of the lTev* Orleans Cotton Exchange on Itarcfr&quot;2nd caused a serious dislocation of cotton supplies and raw cotton prices in Liverpool rose, but after the end of March they returned to their former level.     As a result of the uncertain position, deliveries of raw ootton to spinners fell to 24.9 million 1d3. per week against 28.9 in February 1933, and 27 o4 in Ilarch 1932.Yarn production in the American section fell off in a similar wa.y to the raw ootton deliveries but recovered slightly later*     The Egyptian section was not affected by the crisis and the expansion during February continued into liar oh.Unemployment increo-sed during March, more rapidly among weavers than among spinners, and was much higher than a year ago.     The number of short-time workers also increased.
Electrical Industry * - The output of electricity by author!aed undertakings in liarch 1953 was 1,160 million units, an increase of 6*3$ on March 193 2.The percentage, of productive capacity for plant in use rose during the month owing to orders for heavy plant from-South Africa and India.The indices (1920 = 100) of orders received for heavy plant v;ere Hone 68, compared with 4S in March of last year, and Export 65 compared with 112o       Orders for light material have declined owing to increased imports of carbons, batteries, and scientific electrical instrument aaHot or Industry * - Conditions in the home market remain steadya Commercial vehxole construction is being sieved down by uncertainty arisxng out of the Salter Report0Export to Australia is hampered by the excessive duty on bodies and panels, designed to foster the body-building plant at Adelaides      ,In Canada motor bu303 have until recently been excluded from the Free List but the new Canadian budget gives free entry to British motor busesoMachine Tools* - There i3 no material change in the hone marJcet.     Export 3 during March 1953, were 5153,471 oompared with  304,926 in March 1932.     Exports to Russia were flj.00^682 compared with  833,990*     It is stated that no further Russian orders are now being placcda     Imports of machine tools are 3mall oWool. - On the wliole, machinery has not been quite so fully employed during March as a year ago,  but the output of merino tops remains large and the combing section i3 still fairly well employed.Exports of tops, and of woollen and worsted yams and tissues in February were all 3lightly higher than in the previous year.An organisation embracing 90$ of the commission combing industry has been i^orued under the name of the Wool Combers1 Mutual Association Limited, to buy up redundant machinery and to eliminate price-cutting.     An attempt is also being made to prevent price-cutting in the piece-dyeing and finishing trade.Cotton. - The closing of the ITew Orleans Cotton Exchange on March 2nd caused a serious dislocation of cotton supplies and raw cotton prioes in Liverpool rose, but after the end of March they returned to their former level.     As a result of the uncertain position, deliveries of raw ootton to spinners fell to 24*9 million lb3. per week against 26.9 in February 1933, and 27o4 in Maroh 1952.Yarn production in the American section fell off in a similar way to the raw ootton deliveries but recovered slightly later *     The Egyptian section was not affected by the orisi3 and the expansion during February continued into Maroh.Unemployment increased during March, more rapidly among weavers than among spinner a, and was much higher than a year ago.     The number pf short-tine workers also increased.
!For the xir3t tv/o months of this year there uas no substantial change in the export trade, and exports of piece goodc have remained at about 106 million sq. yards per month since Decembere     Japanese exports were 200 million sq. yards per month in the latter half of 195 2, but fell to 154 in January 1955, while the preliminary figure for February is 158* Japanese trade to India appears to be affeoted by the higher tariff on non-British piece goods.Other Industrie a. - The home demand for rubber tyres   is stiHT&quot;good but in rubber 3hoes both the home and export&apos; markets are suffering intense competition from Japan0     Soap consumption has now reached a normal seasonal figure.   Owing to the low prioe of butter, sales of margarine in the first quarter of 1933 were nearly 10$ less than in 1932 o   Production of crude oils and fata in the seme period showed a gain cf about 10$.     There was a noticeable improvement in March in the heavy chemical trade.     The output of dye stuff s also showed some improvement, although prices are stxll Exceptionally low.     There, has been a considerable increase in activity in the boot and shoe trade and many factories have been working at full pressure.     It is thought, however, that this activity ia mainly seasonal.Finance and Banking.    (a) London.   Money ra/tes have continued weak and on the 24th JlarcE-the Treasury Bill rate reached 3/9.27d. per cent., the lowest figure ever quotede The Government 2-^$ Conversion Loan, redeemable in 1944, was announced on 18th Maroh;    the first  5 millions was allotted at  94.11.9d. and the next  10 millions at  9404c-d.   The proceeds are to be used to reduce outstanding Treasurj&apos; Bills.The Bank of England acquired gold to the value of  21,612,000 during March, partly on account of the transfer of American balanoe3 prior to the banking crisis.     The Treasury authority for the extra  15 millions fiduciary issue was allowed to lapse on 31st March.The Gilt-yedge Market has sho\7n narked strength:    the &quot;investors1 chronicle&quot; index number for British Funds v/as 122o5 on 27th March compared with 120*3 on 27th February (December 1923 = 100).(b) United States.   The proclamation of the banking moratorium wa3 followed by an extension of the note issuing powers of the Federal Reserve Banks and the granting of wide powers to President Roosevelt.     Such banks as have been adjudged sound have since re-opened, but there has been no repetition of the &quot;run&quot;.Before the closing of the banlcs the dollar rate was $3.45;   when dealings were resumed on 13th March, the rate improved to $3.38, and ha3 sinoe fluctuated between $5*40 and $3o45.     Money rates have fallen from 4$ to 5$ during the month.(c) Franceo   The final estimates of the budget indicate a deficit o?&quot;&quot;Fr3o4,0C0   millions *     A new Frs. 5,000 millions4-JfS loan has been issued at 98vry redeemable in 30 year3 at 150. The issue was well subscribed and as a consequence the Treasury ha3 been enabled to reduce the rate on one-month Treasury Bonds from 2$ to 1^$.(d) Germany.   The accession of the new Government and the return &quot;of&quot;Dr. Schaoht to the Reichsbani: caused a mild boom on the Bourse, but prices deolined again as a result of the anti-Jewish agitation and the Nazi-Stahlhelm disputes.   The reduction in the Reichsbank discount rate whioh was expected to follow the new &quot;Standstill&quot; agreement has not yet material!soda
The fears of foreign creditors have &quot;been allayed by Dr. Schacht&apos;s declaration that he would recognise commercial debts to the last penny.(e) Austria.    The Chancellor has- issued a decree providing relief for banks, other than the Credit Anstalt, on condition that they come under the control of the National Bank.    The Austrian Government are finding difficulty in implementing the agreement arrived at last year with the foreign creditors of the Credit Anstalt. -(f) Canada.    The announcement of a new tax of 5 per cent, on interest or dividends paid to non-resident holders of Canadian securities caused the suspension of quotations for Canadian stocks on the London Stork Exchange on 31st March. They were resumed on the following day after an official statement by the Canadian Minister of Finance that xhe tax applied only to interest payable in Canadian currency.(g) New Zealand.    The conversion of  115 millions of internal Government loans from a 5 per cent,  to   a, 4 per cent, basis has been carried through successfully.    The conversion was, in effect, compulsory as non-converted holdings are to be subject to special taxation.Retail Trade -   The values of sales decreased by 3r4 per cent,  in February 1933, compared with February 1932.    This figure was made up of a decrease of 2.7 per cent,  in the non-Food Departments, and 3.9 per cent, in the Food Departments.The decrease of total sales was fairly evenly spread over the country, being 2.5 per cent, in the West End of London, 2.8 per cent, in the South of England, 1.2 per cent, in Suburban London, 5.5 per cent, in Northern England and 1.5 per cent, in Scotland.    atocks showed a reduction of 8.1 per cent, on last year.In departmental stores alone trade in February 1953 compared with the previous year showed a reduction in Great Britain of 4.5 per cent., and in the United States of 25 per cent.    February figures for Germany are not yet available, but the reduction in January was 12.5 per cent.Canadian Trade - There was little change in the general situation in February.    The index of wholesale prices was 63.6 compared with 63.9 in January.    The index of the physical volume of business fell from 68.1 to 67.0.Mineral production improved during the month.    Exports of nickel, copper, zinc and silver increased.    Imports of bauxite for the manufacture of aluminium -/were 50 per cent, greater than in January.The iron and steel industry showed a sharp decline, the index falling to 19,6.    The last two blast furnaces in operation in Canada were closed down during February.Australian Trade -   For the 8 months ended February, 1935, imports were  50,262,000 and exports  83,480,000 compared with  36,522,000 and  70,189,000, respectively, in the corresponding period of 1931/2,Between the 1st July, 1932, and the end of February, 1933, 2,607,000 bales of wool were received into store, of which 1,990,000 were disposed of.    The average price for February
was 8.703. per lb. compared with 8.56d, in January.    Shipments of wheat up to the 22nd I larch amounted to 69,298,000 bushels compared with 56,801,000 in the previous year.    Exports of flour also increased.    Owing to the lack of rain the output of butter is expected to decline.Indian Trade.  - Imports in February, 1933, amounted to 922 lakhs of rupees compared with 998 in February, 1932, while exports were 1,245 compared with 1,255.    Net exports of gold were 489 lakhs compared with 743.Crop forecasts show little change compared with last year; the rice crop is estimated at 30,655,000 tons compared with 32,988,000 tons     While cotton is estimated at 4,425,000 bales compared with 4,064,000 bales.colonial Trade.-   Production of finished copper in Northern Rhodesia in the last quarter of 1952 was 19,058 tons compared with 7,005 tons in the last quarter of 1931; production of copper concentrates was nil compared with 7..131 tons, and of vanadium ore 157,419 lbs. compared with 103,465 lbs.    Gold production fell to 357 ozs. compared with 2,314 ozs.The import statistics for 1932 show that in Palestine, Kenya and Uganda, Nigeria, and Gold Coast the percentage share of the trade held b?/ the United Kingdom was greater than in 1931.South American Trade. -   Tho position of British traders in Argentina is expected to improve considerably if the trade agreement with the United Kingdom is completed.    Exchange is at present available for current import transactions but is available only on a very limited scale for use by the British Public Utility companies which, consequently, are unable to meet their dividend charges.    It is considered that the recommendations of the Niemeyer Report will probably be adopted.In Uruguay the low prices of produce and the destruction of crops by locusts have led to a political crisis.    Exchange control remains strict, but current import requirements are being met and the utility companies are receiving some consideration.In Brazil the market is expecting a further coffee surplus as a result of the coming crop.    The official exchange control is providing exchange for current imports, but accounts for past transactions remain frozen.The war between Paraguay and Bolivia is having little effect on agricultural production, but the Paraguayan finances are suffering.In Colombia the war with Peru has caused a suspension of interest payments on foreign loans.The financial situation in Chile is extremely difficult. Owing to the diminished demand for nitrates and copper, exports have fallen to a negligible figure. After the liquidation of the Cosach Combine has been completed, it may be possible for Chilean nitrate to compete with the synthetic material. With regard to copper, a rise in price will be necessary before the low-grade Chilean mines can sell in the world market.
