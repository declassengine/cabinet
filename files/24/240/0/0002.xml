THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1933.SECEET. Copy No.    43CP. 102 (33).CABINET.THE SITUATION IN THE FAR EAST.Note by the Secretary of State for Air.FROM the comments made at the meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 6th April I understand that my colleagues would welcome further information as to the need for the landing ground recommended by the Chiefs of Staff as part of the permanent scheme of defence of Singapore.I accordingly circulate a memorandum in which the Chief of the Air Staff sets out in detail the reasons why this aerodrome is essential.In view of his conclusions I ask for Cabinet approval for the construction of the landing ground on the site already acquired by the Singapore Government. The cost will be approximately  40,000, of which  12,000 would be spent this year.L.Air Ministry, April 10, 1933.THE SITUATION IN THE FAR EAST.Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff.THE Singapore Base, upon which wholly depends the security of our interests and of those of the Dominions in the Far East, will remain liable to a destructive bombardment by Japanese heavy ships and aircraft-carriers until such time as adequate defences have been provided. Even the first stage of the provision of such defences cannot be complete for over three years.2 Pending the installation of the 15-inch guns at Singapore, the only defence against heavy ships is the torpedo-bomber aeroplane, of which one squadron is now located there. I am confident that the addition of another similar squadron is the only practicable means of minimising the grave risks which must be run in the interval before the completion of the permanent scheme of defence.3 The three Japanese aircraft-carriers have a total operating capacity of 128 aircraft, and normally carry sixty torpedo bombers in addition to fighters. The aircraft in these vessels could be used not only to damage the naval base by bombardment, but also to attack the air base with a view to neutralising our torpedo bombers and thus minimising the risk to the bombarding battleships.The best defence against the Japanese aircraft-carriers would be the torpedo-bombing aircraft.4. The heavy task that would confront our two squadrons in the event of war, and their great inferiority in numbers compared with the Japanese Fleet Air Arm make it essential that we should exploit to the fullest possible extent[8468]
2the advantages which land-based aircraft possess in relation to those borne on ships..As is well known, the great weakness of ship-borne aircraft lies in the concentration of all their &apos; resources into a small number of ships, which constitute very vulnerable targets. A few hits with bombs or torpedoes may thus put the whole of the enemy&apos;s air resources completely out of action.Land-based aircraft, on the other hand, can and must use alternative aerodromes and landing grounds, so as to distribute their aircraft and resources and thus avoid one of the gravest disadvantages under which the carrier suffers.5. It would therefore be essential, even though the air forces to be used in the defence of Singapore were to be confined to two squadrons, that alternative landing grounds should exist.There are, however, two further cogent reasons to support the need for the second landing ground.In the first place, in the event of war it would be necessary to reinforce Singapore as rapidly as possible by further air units. A scheme for this has already been before the Committee of Imperial Defence.In an emergency these units could be crowded into the existing base, but only at a sacrifice of a great part of their fighting efficiency and that of the units already there.Secondly, it will be necessary after the arrival of the main fleet at Singapore to provide, from time to time, temporary accommodation on a landing ground ashore for at least a proportion of the Fleet Air Arm. Subject to the views of the First Sea Lord, I suggest that it may be necessary to disembark at any one time at least the full complement of one aircraft carrier (36-52 aircraft).6. At many places the lack of an adequate number of aerodromes might be made good to some extent by improvisation. Any large open space with suitable surface can rapidly be adapted as a landing ground.At Singapore, however, no such expedient would be possible. The island consists of a tangle of hills running down either dii-ect to the sea or to swamps near the shore; and landing grounds can only be provided by carrying out laborious levelling operations at suitable points at the intersections of the ridges. All the available ground is covered with rubber plantations.Preparation of a landing ground is therefore a lengthy operation, and could not possibly be left until an emergency had occurred.7. Almost the whole of the site provisionally chosen for the proposed new landing ground was acquired by the Singapore Government some years ago with a view to the construction of an aerodrome, and it is hoped that the ground would be handed over to His Majesty&apos;s Government free of charge. A small part in private ownership is valued at approximately  1,500. Any alternative site would be more costly and operationally less suitable. The expenditure necessary to prepare the ground would be as follows : 1933-34. Acquisition and part construction ... 12,000 1934-35.  Completion ... ... ... ...      28,0008. It will be observed that I am not proposing at the present time that any accommodation should be provided at the new landing ground. The indispensable requirement is the preparation of the surface so that aeroplanes can land on it.It will be more economical to build for the second squadron at the existing base and to rely for the accommodation of reinforcing squadrons at the new aerodrome upon the provision of temporary hutments, or even of canvas:9.   To summarise : (a) Until the permanent scheme of defence is completed, the security of singapore must depend largely upon the air forces stationed there assisted by air reinforcements in emergency.(b) Whatever the strength of air forces maintained, it is essential for the operational reasons explained in paragraphs 4 and 5 that alternative landing grounds should be available.
Air Ministry, April 10,1933.(c) Without a second landing ground the safety of the air units would been dangered and their operational efficiency prejudiced.(d) Without a second landing ground the great value of the addition of rein-forcing squadrons in emergency would be largely impaired by,;tjie congestion and lack of freedom to operate.(e) The nature of the topography of the island of Singapore makes theimprovisation of landing grounds at short notice impossible.
