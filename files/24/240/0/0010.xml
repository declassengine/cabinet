THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1933.SECRET. Copy No.   o2CP. 110 (33).CABINET.FUTURE OF CIVIL AIR COMMUNICATIONS OF THE EMPIRE.Note by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE herewith a memorandum which has been prepared by the Board of Imperial Airways, Limited, entitled the &quot; Future of Civil Air Communications of the Empire,&quot; which I think my colleagues will be interested to read.2. This memorandum follows on a recent tour of inspection by Sir Eric Geddes, the Chairman of the Company, in the course of which he flew to Cape Town and back. As a result of this tour Sir Eric is greatly impressed (a) with the keen interest taken by the Dominion and Colonial administrations in the further development of our system of Imperial Air Communications; (b) with the need for ensuring that that development shall, if possible, proceed by means of a scheme of close co-operation and mutual partnership between the United Kingdom and the Dominions and Colonies; and (c) with the extreme importance of planning for the future well in advance of the expiry of the existing agreement with Imperial Airways.3. Sir Eric has taken the opportunity of this memorandum to summarise (and illustrate by a series of striking graphs), the progress achieved by Imperial Airways to date. It is only fair to the Company for me to say that, in my judg-ment, they deserve great credit for that progress, even if it has fallen short of our original anticijDations. Their mandate from His Majesty&apos;s Government is to become self-supporting at as early a date as possible. It is now apparent that it is most unlikely that, when the existing agreements run out in 1937 to 1939, it will be possible for the Company to carry on without any subsidy. Nevertheless, a steady advance towards economic operation has been accomplished; and Imperial Airways are markedly nearer this ultimate goal than their Continental competitors.4. Thus in 1924-25, the Company&apos;s first year of operation, subsidy was over 63 per cent, of total revenue on their European services. In the current year the corresponding figure is estimated at 35 per cent. Over their services as a whole, including the African service only opened last year, subsidy to-day amounts to approximately 50 per cent, of total revenue; corresponding figures for French, German and U.S.A. Companies of the same standing are 8S per cent.,* 63 per cent., and 65 per cent. The growth of passenger traffic during the past year or two has been phenomenal, despite the economic depression, and, though up to date mail revenue has unfortunately fallen short of the estimates on which the subsidy agreements were originally framed, it is, on the Imperial Services, showing a steady annual increase.My colleagues will find other interesting data illustrative of the Company&apos;s progress in the memorandum and its Appendices.5. I do not ask that the Cabinet shall take any action on this memorandum for the present; I wish merely to acquaint them with the position and progress of the Company and the current trend of thought of its Executive.  Accordingly,* This fig-uro is two years old, and may have been improved upon subsequently.[8487]
I refrain at this stage from any comment on the Board&apos;s concrete proposals. On these I will circulate a further memorandum in due course, and, since some of them are of intimate concern to the Post Office, the Postmaster-General will, I understand, wish to do the same. In the meantime I will only say that I agree broadly with Sir E. Geddes&apos;s points made at (a), (6) and (c) of paragraph 2, above. I believe that civil air transport, properly handled, is destined to be a factor of steadily increasing importance to the British Commonwealth of Nations, not merely commercially as a means of stimulating the flow of inter-Imperial trade, but also politically, as a means of promoting and maintaining those close and continuous contacts between the constituent members of the Commonwealth which are so essential to our Imperial well-being.Air Ministry, April 13, 1933.

FUTURE OF CIVIL AIR COMMUNICATIONS   OF THE   EMPIREA Memorandum submitted byTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF IMPERIAL AIRWAYStoHIS MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTTHE Board of Imperial Airways is anxious, timcously, to invite the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the future position of the Civil Air Communications of the Empire. From this review, are excluded such enterprises as arc operated by other agencies than Imperial Airways, whether by Governmental assistance or not, within Great Britain or the Dominions, Colonies and Territories forming the British Empire. With the exception of certain Australian and Canadian Services, none of these seem to be of major importance or of firmly established character.The Agreements which are now in force, including the prospective agreement for a line to Australia, arc, presumably intentionally, all approximately coterminous between the years 1937 and 1939. We may roughly say, therefore, that there arc five years ahead of us, under the present agreements, including the prospective Australian Agreement. As hitherto the development in aeronautical science has fixed the useful life of an aircraft at between four and five years, and as the Board thinks that its newest aircraft will be reaching an obsolescent age in the same number of years, the Board is in the position that, to a very great extent, its present fleet will reach complete obsolescence at the time the main line agreements draw to a close.While, within prudent limits, the Board will look forward to renewing its oldest aircraft within the remaining years of the agrcc-commitments , it is obvious that progress cannot be fully maintained and prudence must necessarily rule, until the views and intentions of
H.M. Government as to at and after 1938 arc known in sufficient detail and with sufficient certainty.Moreover, it lias been found, in practice, that fully 3J years elapse between the conception of new types of aircraft and their final cmploy-mcnt in service; after allowing for the process of planning, detailed designing, construction and, what is becoming of increasing importance, the correction of teething troubles of new aircraft. H.M. Government will appreciate that for aircraft of the types used by Imperial Airways on the main Empire routes, it has been and, so far as we can sec in the near future, will be, impossible to buy suitable aircraft of any standard British design, and the Board has had to take the very great risk which is increasing as the size and value of the aircraft increase of ordering a whole scries, as in the case of the &quot; Hannibal&apos;: or &quot; Atalanta &quot; classes, before they have been able to test one of the scries, to sec whether it comes up to the specification requirements.In order to anticipate a point which might be raised, that we could order one experimental aircraft, and, after it had proved satis-factory in service, order more of the same class, the Board wishes to point out that it would probably take three and a half years to go through this experimental process with one aircraft, and two more years to build the rest of the series, which would therefore be obsolete in aeronautical design and science, before they came into service, under the present rate of progress of aeronautical technique. In addition, the mere running of one experimental aircraft of each successive type would give such a heterogeneous fleet, that it would be entirely unsatisfactory to the Company, the travelling public and the Governments concerned, and would be very expensive.It is hoped that enough has been said on this subject to show that it is desirable to raise, now, the question of the future policy of H.M. Government, as regards Civil Air Communications of the Empire, so that we may invite discussions, and, if H.M. Government wish, enter into negotiations for the future development of our Empire and other Air Services and their extension.REVIEW OF PAST RECORD OF IMPERIAL AIRWAYS.Imperial Airways was formed by H.M. Government as the result of the investigations of a Committee appointed in 1923, known as the &quot; Hambling&quot; Committee. In accordance with the Report of this Committee, the public was invited to subscribe to Imperial Airways,r 4 ]
which was given certain preferential treatment as regards subsidy from H.M. Government for a limited period of time, and was intended to amalgamate the four existing smaller pioneer Civil Air Operating Companies, which were then receiving very precarious financial assistance from H.M. Government.It is thought desirable to give here, for ready reference, information as to how Imperial Airways has discharged the trust placed in it by the Government. The Board at this point, however, wishes to record its appreciative acknowledgement of the consistent help and co-operation of the Air Council, and of all the Officers concerned, in the Air Ministry. It also wishes to acknowledge the ever-ready help and co-operation of the Royal Air Force overseas. Without such help, at home and abroad, the attainment of the results disclosed in this Memorandum, would have been impossible.I. In Safely. It is thought sufficient to say that the Company&apos;s record and reputation stand so high that Lloyd&apos;s Insurance rate for passengers is now the same as that quoted for surface transport but it is exclusive to Imperial Airways for air travel. The British insurance rates for other air transport companies are from 10 to 12 times as high.2. In Regularity. Last year only 2-9% of flights scheduled were cancelled, (including those cancelled for weather reasons), compared with 5 - 3% the previous year, and 23% in the first year of the Company&apos;s existence.3. Route Mileage operated now is approaching 12,000. This has grown from about 1,700 miles in 1924.4. The Ton Mileage of Capacity flown in the year 1924-25 was about 650,000 ton miles; in 1931-32 it was 2,230,000 ton miles; the current year&apos;s figure is estimated to reach about 3,000,000 ton miles.5. Ratio of Subsidy to Total Revenue, to indicate the progress, must be reviewed separately for each route, because the Subsidy must always be proportionately high for the first year, on any route or extension, and during the Company&apos;s nine years&apos; life, tiiere generally has been an extension in the early stages of development, to vitiate an average figure.In 1924, when the Company&apos;s endre operations were confined to the European services, the subsidy amounted to over 63% of the total revenue; in 1932, the subsidy had fallen to 45% of the total revenue for the European services.   For the current year as far
as the figures to date indicate; the subsidy will amount to about 35% Qf tnc total revenue.On the Indian line, which has now had almost four years of operation, the subsidy for the first year amounted to 73% of the total revenue, while in the current year (estimating the last few months of the financial year) the subsidy will represent 56% of the total revenue.The African route is too young to offer such statistics, as it has only been in operation as a through service for just over a year, but it can be said that the revenue shows a continuous growth and, as by the agreement, the subsidy diminishes each year, it follows that the percentage of subsidy to total revenue on this route must also be falling.6. The growth of traffic carried, and the decrease in cost per ton mile carried, are shown for convenience in graph form in Appendix &quot; A,&quot; under the heads of Mails, Passengers and Freight, and are compared with the estimates made at the time by the Government Departments concerned and Imperial Airways.It is clear from these charts, therefore, that the Company has made steady and remarkable progress towards becoming self-supporting.The most disturbing factor, however, is the mail revenue. This has not grown at anything like die rate estimated by the Government and Imperial Airways in conference, and upon which the subsidy is based.This appears to the Board to require immediate attention, if the whole economic future of Empire Air Communications is not to be jeopardised. We have abundant proof that, to die scattered com-munitics of the Empire, it is as the &quot; Air Mail &quot; that our service bulks fust in their minds, and secondly as a passenger and freight service. This is a subject dealt with at greater length at a later stage in this document, but the Board desires to emphasise that it is in Air Mail traffic development that we appear to be falling behind, and to which we should direct our earnest attention.RETURN TO PROPRIETORS ON INVESTMENT.It is considered desirable at this stage to give, over the years that Imperial Airways has been operating, the amount of profits distributed to the Shareholders, after the Board has provided obsolescence,r e ]
generally speaking, it is believed, in accordance with the views of the Secretary of State for Air.During the eight years of the Company&apos;s existence, from 1924 to 1932, the amount paid in Dividends to the Shareholders averaged 3% on the paid-up capital.Owing to the large sums appropriated for obsolescence, and pro-grcssivc elimination of unsaleable assets from the Balance Sheet, all of which arc within the knowledge of the Advisors to the Secretary of State, the Company has been unable to create any reserves. The sum left to carry forward last year amounted to only  25,000. It cannot be said, therefore, that the Shareholders have made even moderately reasonable profits, having regard to the commercial risks involved, and particularly in an industry having die unusual features of Air Transport at its present stage of development. The Board has consistently enjoyed the support of its Shareholders, but it cannot be overlooked that, should new money be required, for development, a public issue would be necessary.AIR   TRANSPORT   POLICY   OF   HIS   MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Apart from the London-Paris and London-Cologne services, which the Board regards as a &quot; shop window,&quot; but important for the maintenance of British prestige in Europe, the Civil Air Transport policy of H.M. Government has been developed along Empire lines, with Imperial Airways as their instrument, being responsible for the main lines only, and leaving each Dominion, Colony or Territory to develop internal or feeder air services for themselves.The Company&apos;s policy, which is well-known, and has been repeatedly and explicitly stated to H.M. Governments along the route, is to help feeder lines locally promoted in each territory, and, if asked by the Government concerned, to take an interest financial or operational, or advisory in such feeders. There has, however, been little development in feeder lines, and what has taken place is neither of a prosperous nor a stable character. Indeed it seems to the Board impossible to hope for much development, until the Main Line services assume a more permanent character. The financial risk in tying-in to a main line service, with only three or four years tenure of existence, is too great.
It has been the policy of H.M. Government to encourage subsidy subscriptions from the British communities which these main line air communications serve en route. Every British community on the African route contributes to the London-Capetown service, and with the probable exception of India, every British community on the Australian route will also contribute in cash or kind.So have been developed the London-Capetown and the London-Karachi services; and soon, it is hoped, will develop the Australian service, via India, Burma and the Malay Peninsula, with an extension to New Zealand. Canada is the next Dominion witli whom we arc out of touch in the air, but the progress of invention and acronau-tical science gives the Board of Imperial Airways every hope that, before long, a trans-Atlantic service can be started with Canada, which can be linked up with a service from the East Coast of Canada to Vancouver and possibly beyond.It must be remembered, however, and the Board is sure that H.M. Government have it in mind, that the power of routing mail traffic lies with the sending country; and, having regard to the importance of trans-Atlantic mail coming from and routed by the United States of America, the Board visualises that any trans-Atlantic service must certainly be operated in conjunction with, and with the goodwill of, that country. With that end in view, the Board has consistently maintained cordial co-operation and friendly relations with Pan American Airways, which may perhaps be described as corresponding in the United States air policy to Imperial Airways in the British Empire.Further extensions which the Board contemplates, as and when it is possible, would be from North America to Bermuda and the West Indies ; and from Bangkok to Hong Kong, Shanghai and, possibly, to Tokio. It can therefore be contemplated that, if circum-stances permit, the British Empire, in its widest sense, can be linked up almost completely by air in the next ten years.FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS.It is natural and proper that Financial considerations should receive attention in this broad review of the civil communications of the Empire, and the Board invites the consideration of the following table, which shows the reduction in cost of operation by Imperial Airways per capacity ton mile, and in the subsidy cost to H.M.
Government per capacity ton mile, in the course of the Company&apos;s development :Comparison of Operating Cost per Ton Mile.European Services (Which have been in operation since the Company&apos;s inception).1925 ..       ..      ..      ..      .. 100.01927.......... 74-6i929   .......... 63.81931 . .       ..      ..      ..      .. 60.61932.......... 49-6Empire Services cannot be so compared year by year owing to the incidence of the commencement of new extensions and routes, but the operating cost on these as a whole has been reduced by approximately one half in three to four years a rate which exceeds the progress made in the European services indicated above.Comparison of Subsidy Cost to H.M. Government per Ton Mile.European Services:1924-25    .. .. 4-2 shillings per capacity ton mile.i929-30 .. 2-1       ,,       ,,1932-33   - - - - 1 &quot;5        &quot;       &quot;        &quot;        &quot;England-Egypt-India Service :1929-30   ..       ..    7-5 shillings per capacity ton mile.I932-33 - -    3*6From this it will be seen that steady progress has been made in reduction of cost and in reduction of subsidy per ton mile.On every main section of the routes there has been steady progress in the percentage of capacity utilised to capacity flown, although the capacity flown has also increased.

Naturally the new sections, as brought into operation, show poor results until the public has learned to use the new service.The Board has, however, no hesitation in stating that, in its belief, no other major civil aviation undertaking in the world can show results equal to these, and submits them with confidence to the judgment of H.M. Government.
If the Board is right in assuming that H.M. Government would consider it a major catastrophe to suspend the present services or the development of the proposed air services, there is consolation for the cost to the taxpayer to be found in that every great country has to subsidise its air services, and the British taxpayer is getting better value for his subsidy than is the taxpayer of any other country; and in that British civil aviation, as represented by the services of Imperial Air-ways, shows the earliest prospect of becoming economically independent; the only present major anxiety of the Board being the failure of air mail traffic as compared with the forecasts.If, therefore, H.M. Government decide consistently to follow the course which they have followed or forecast for the 15 years from 1924 to 1939, it is desirable that the lines of future development should be considered now, and the Board puts forward its observations for the consideration of H.M. Government in the following main headings :THE FUTURE1. Technical and Geographical Development. 2. Politico-financial Aspects.3. Basis of Mail income : Benefits to the communities served, and Empire-binding value of air services. Taking these three heads seriatim :No. 1.   TECHNICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL DEVELOP-MENT.There are certain outstanding features which emerge in connection with the present routes, and these should be borne clearly in mind.They are as follows : (a) The loss of time and the outgoing cost of the rail secdon of the Empire routes from Paris to Brindisi. (Approximately  25,000 p.a. for present passenger and freight traffic only, plus what the Postmaster-General pays for mail transit.)(b) The sterility on the African route of the secdon from Nairobi to Salisbury, in forwarded and received traffic.(c) The high cost of transport of fuel and other supplies from the seaboard to the present African Air route which, for the Company&apos;s present (pre &quot; Atalanta&quot;) service amounts to  50,000 and which would, of course, increase pro rata for larger and more powerful aircraft and for a more frequent[   &quot;   ]
service.   Similar high costs of fuel  prevail at certain isolated places on die Indian route.   Fuel will always cost less at the seaboard than at inland places. The present comparatively small saving in time from London to Cape Town has retarded the development of traffic to and from the section Johannesburg and South thereof, although the improvement in the last four months is striking.   This disadvantage will disappear shortly, however, as, when the &quot; Atalantas&quot; are in service, the comfort in the air will  be greater,  and  on   the ground  much improved, and it is intended that the time will be cut down from eleven to nine days.   Under our further proposals, the time should again be reduced to seven days.    We may then hope for a very substantial increase of all classes of traffic, especially to and from Johannesburg, and South thereof.There is one further point which appears of major importance in considering the present situation. As far as the Board can see, and in accordance with the advice of its technical officers, although the very striking reduction in cost per Capacity Ton Mile (given on page 9) has been attained largely by the development of progressively larger aircraft, yet it appears that land aircraft may well be approaching the maximum size which will be economically possible. Large marine-aircraft do not appear to offer the serious mooring and airport problems which attend large land-aircraft. In any case, even a comparison between the &quot; Hannibal &quot; land aircraft, and the &quot; Scipio &quot; marine aircraft classes shows advantages in favour of the latter, which, so far as the Board can sec, arc likely to be accentuated in the future. Further increasing the size of aircraft naturally means increasing their weight. Also the development in design and in economy of operation is tending towards higher cruising speeds and higher landing speeds, with consequently a longer take-off. Aerodromes, therefore, which are limited in size by physical surroundings or otherwise, and which have an unstable subsoil, will no longer be suitable without heavy expenditure if larger and faster aircraft are used, and the same thing applies to emergency landing grounds. An excellent example of this is Nairobi aerodrome which, without extra capital expenditure, is unsuitable either for the &quot; Hannibals &quot; of the northern section, or for the &quot; Atalantas &quot; of the southern section. It is understood, how-ever, that this expenditure is being undertaken. On a route like the Northern African section, it is impossible to avoid the use of landing grounds which have physical disadvantages or other obstacles to the
economic use of larger land-aircraft. These aerodrome disadvantages and difficulties largely disappear in the case of marine-aircraft which, with few exceptions, take-off at sea level, and have alighting areas that arc much less restricted than the aerodromes that can be provided for land aircraft. Given sheltered water for landing and taking-off, and without losing sight of certain drawbacks, there are many advantages for marine- as against land-aircraft.Appendix B attached shows the routes at present being operated and the chief alternatives to be considered for possible future development.Flying the whole way from England to Egypt presents no technical difficulty for cither flying boats or land aircraft, and in cither case the route would probably pass by way of Marseilles. From there, however, there arc so many possible alternative routes, all involving the use of foreign ports, that, for reasons that will be obvious, the Marseilles-Egypt section is shown on die map diagram-matically only by a straight line without showing any intermediate refuelling points.A flying boat route from Egypt to Mombasa and Dar-cs-Salaam is shown as an alternative to the present route. Similarly flying boats can be operated from Egypt to Karachi via Lake Habbaniyah, Basra, and along the Persian Gulf or via Aden and Kuria Muria. It is possible to operate across India to Calcutta by flying boats via Udaipur Lake or via Bombay, Hyderabad, Cocanada and Chilka Lake. From Calcutta eastward to Australia is equally a land aircraft or flying boat route, and from Port Darwin the flying boat coastal route to Brisbane and Sydney is shown as an alternative to the land aircraft route.The alternative routes to Nordi America are given for a different reason than the alternatives on the Africa and Australia routes. In this case it is weather condidons and/or political considerations that make it undesirable at this stage to choose for exclusive development any particular one of the alternatives.It is important at this stage to state that the introduction of multi-engined aircraft, and the enormously increased reliability of aircraft engines, coupled with the reserve of power provided in the Company&apos;s latest aircraft, have enabled the Board to adopt without misgiving, and as a definite policy, the indiscriminate flying of modern land air-craft over stretches of sea, and of modern marine-aircraft over stretches of land.   The Board has no hesitation in accepting, for example, the
responsibility of flying marine-aircraft overland between Bordeaux and Marseilles, or land-aircraft over the sea from Rome to Malta and Malta to Benghazi, or marine-aircraft from Port Sudan to Khartoum, or Kisumu to Mombasa.It may also be taken as axiomatic that fuel, which represents 20% of our flying cost, will always be at its cheapest at the seaboard. There is a tendency everywhere for railways to put the maximum, or at any rate, a very high charge on the fuel we require inland, and for hard-pressed Governments to raise revenue by means of a duty on fuel and other supplies which we require inland.The Board visualises the future as presenting greater opportunities for the development of our Empire air routes by marine air-craft, than by land aircraft, and contemplates linking inland cities with the &quot; through &quot; marine aircraft at points along the coast by land craft.The Board, after careful study, contemplates an increase in the size of marine-aircraft from the &quot; Scipio &quot; class with four engines and an all-up weight of 32,000 lbs. to cight-cngincd units, or more than double the size, with a more than corresponding increase in the all-up weight, with a range of, say, 1,000 miles, and a cruising speed of, say, 115 m.p.h. There appears to be another advantage in the use of marine-aircraft under suitable circumstances, and that is the lengthening of the &quot; Flying Day &quot; by night flying, because, with the large number of existing aids to marine navigation, and the greater case of position plotting, less additional ground equipment will be necessary and therefore fess expenditure.The completion of the Australian route is under negotiation and, we hope, nearing fruition. As has been indicated, the Board contemplates the possibility of reaching Karachi by marine-aircraft, via Egypt, Lake Habbaniyah, Basra, or alternatively via Egypt, Port Sudan, Aden, and Kuria Muria. It is probable that for any immediate consideration, land-aircraft of the &quot; Atalanta&quot; type will fully serve the needs of the African route south of Nairobi and the initial needs of the Australian service from Basra or Karachi eastwards, and it is hoped that arrangements will be possible, which will allow of starting the route with a homogeneous fleet operating the whole way southwards thereof to Sydney and Melbourne. The Board attaches more importance than ever to the vital need for operation of the whole main route by one authority. Later, if the traffic on this route grew so that it passed the capacity of land-aircraft
and aerodromes, the question of substituting marine-aircraft, from Calcutta or Karachi onwards, to Australia may have to be considered. Similarly, from Nairobi to Cape Town the development of traffic will, in the next year or two, show whether the &quot; Atalanta &quot; or some other type is best suited to the requirements.The possibility of flying the Atlantic is fully before us, and, as has been said, the Board has cultivated the most friendly and close relations with Pan American Airways. This relationship is fully reciprocal. The Board hopes that in time the passage from the North of Ireland to Newfoundland will become possible, though a more southerly route might have to be adopted initially. The Secretary of State knows that the Board is in correspondence with the Canadian Pacific Railway, and with the Canadian Government in general, as to further arrangements in Canada.There remains only in major Empire extensions the operation of a branch from the Australian line at Bangkok to Hanoi, Hong Kong and Shanghai, continuing possibly to Tokio.No. 2.   POLITICO-FINANCIAL ASPECTS.This appears to the Board to be a matter which calls for the most earnest consideration. At present we are only receiving contributions to our Empire Air Services from the Communities on the African route south of Egypt, and the Union of South Africa has given freely and generously her contribution, which, excluding Great Britain&apos;s, is the largest. But the agreement is for five years, of which only four years remain, and there may well be thoughts as to the greater and more active share that South Africa might take, when the present agreement comes to a close. It may, of course, be that South Africa will continue to contribute to Imperial Airways as to-day.The Chairman, in his tour down the African Route, found the greatest enthusiasm for the service from, and including, the Sudan to Southern Rhodesia, and found no indication of a desire to change the way in which Imperial Airways runs and controls the route. In the Union, although the enthusiasm was similarly great for the service and diminished only at Capetown, owing to the journey-time factor, there were indications that certain individuals in un-official positions were perhaps considering the possibility of a change, when the present agreement comes to an end. The Secretary of State will
remember that this question in connection with India and Australia is a live issue. There is little doubt that, if ever Empire Air Communi-cations extend across Canada, as the Board hopes they will, the question of Canadian participation will also arise. As the Secretary of State knows, and as the Board believes he agrees, the policy of Imperial Air-ways has consistently been very definitely that economy, efficiency and success in the operation of Empire Air Communications can only be obtained if the route, from start to finish, is under one operational control, and under one control as to the policy of disposal, development and replacement of fleet; nevertheless it is clear that the great Dominions of Australia and the Union of South Africa may wish in some way to participate in the operation of the route in which they arc concerned. Assuming that Imperial Airways were to continue to operate the route, it would appear most desirable that we should respond to the desire of these Dominions for a greater share in the undertaking, having regard to their present and probable future contributions in cash or in kind, and that wc should either offer a partnership in the Empire routes as a whole, by contribution to the capital of Imperial Airways, with representation on the Board, or that wc should follow the line that is under discussion in the case of the Indian Empire, and arrange with the great Dominions to form companies which would be 51% owned by Imperial Airways and 49% by the Dominion concerned, so as to preserve the authority necessary to maintain uniformity of standards and fluidity of fleet.The Board appreciates that this might be considered superficially to be a matter solely concerning Imperial Airways, but the whole undertaking is so interlocked with Dominion, Colonial and Postal considerations, and indeed also with Foreign Office considerations, that the Board&apos;s view is that the matter would best be discussed as a whole, and that it intimately concerns the Governments of the Empire as a whole, and is of vital importance to its Air Communications.No. 3. BASIS OF MAIL INCOME : BENEFITS TO COMMUNITIES SERVED AND EMPIRE-BINDING VALUE OF AIR SERVICES.The financial basis of the existing subsidy agreements for the Empire Services is that the amount of Subsidy is calculated by estimating the expenditure and from that deducting estimates of mail
and passenger receipts on a sliding scale, allowing for an estimated rate of growth so that the subsidy progressively decreases. It will be appreciated that the volume of traffic must vary with the fees or rates charged, and the latter must be selected so as to yield the greatest total income. In the case of passenger traffic, the estimates in respect of the Indian, African, and European Services have, generally speaking, been exceeded, and it is worthy of note that the control of passenger traffic, and the rates charged, arc in the hands of the Company; but, in the case of mail traffic, a very different and more complicated problem arises.The Company, in close consultation with the Air Ministry, estimated, in the case of both the Indian and the African Services, the total revenue which would accrue from Air Mails, but the principle failed, because the Company has no voice in determining the fees to be charged to the public these arc fixed by the various Postal Administrations, and vary widely : nor has the Company any say in the methods of advertising, or &quot; selling&quot; the Air Mail to the public. The whole of what might be called the &quot; retail &quot; selling organisation is in the hands of the Postal Administration, and yet, under the existing arrangements, the Company carries the entire commercial risk as to the volume of the traffic. In its endeavours to improve the mail revenue, the Company has spent, and is still spending, relatively large sums of money in advertising the air mail services, and has a department for the purpose of handling the large volume of correspondence which is received on this subject. Some Postal Administrations go to the extent of exacdng a tax upon the air mail services, by charging the public a far higher rate than is paid to the Company. For instance, the Government of India collected  34,000 profit, or &quot; tax,&quot; in that way in 2J years on the India-London air mails carried by Imperial Airways, a service subsidised by the British Taxpayer alone.As a further example, the Air Mail surcharges for letters sent from Baghdad to London produce a revenue to the Iraq Post Office of  2 a kilogram. The payment to the Company is only  1 2s. $d. per kilogram so that the British and Iraq Post Offices between them retain \ys. yd. a kilogram; the Iraq Post Office receives in addition to this the ordinary postage charges for such letters.Under these circumstances, it is clear that any forecast of mail revenue, based upon an esdmatcd volume, which depends upon the lowest possible &quot; retail &quot; rates or fees being charged, must fail, and
the result has been that in the case of both the African and the Indian services, the air mail revenue has been far below the estimates agreed with the Air Ministry before the agreements were concluded.Apart from the profits so collected by the Postal Administrations, it should be recorded in passing that, since Great Britain left the gold standard, the British Post Office has collected payment in gold, for Imperial Airways services, from certain Dominions and from all Foreign Countries still on the gold standard, whilst paying the Company, however, in sterling.These matters arc dealt with at some length, because they show that the present system of the Company taking the risk of volume and revenue, whilst the various Postal Administrations fix and/or vary independently the surcharge fees, must break down the financial structure of the Company&apos;s estimated Profit and Loss Account, and is inimical to the object which H.M. Government and the Board have in view, namely, to reduce, and, if possible, eliminate Subsidy.A close study of the data and experience accumulated by the Company has satisfied the Board as to die necessity of greatly increasing the volume of traffic carried, so as, first, to enable the use of larger and therefore more economical aircraft; and, secondly, to spread the cost of the Company&apos;s comparatively large ground organisation over the greater volume of business, and thus reduce the total cost per ton mile.As has been already stated, the Board is convinced that the Air Mail has now become a necessity to those constituents of the Empire which have such Air Services, and that the latter have passed out of the experimental stage, and have achieved standards of relia-bility and regularity -which place them in the category of an ordinary transport service.The Board suggests, therefore, for the consideration of H.M. Government, that the question of the letter mail, within the geographical limits of existing and prospective air sendees, being carried by air in much greater bulk be reviewed, not only as a step which, when investigated, will in all probability put the Empire Air Services on a basis requiring a relatively small subsidy which should progressively diminish, but as creating a chain which, in view of the Board, will prove to be die strongest bond between the Commonwealth of Free Nations, Colonies and Territories which form the British Empire, and of infinite value to the British Communities overseas.
Data of sufficient accuracy are not available to the Board to enable it to offer, at this stage, financial estimates on this proposal, and much of the data can only be supplied by the Postmaster-General. There is no doubt, however, that a very much greater volume could be carried by air, as far as India, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand are concerned. As regards cost, the Board believes that, given sufficient volume, the ordinary rates could be charged with perhaps an adjustment of the minimum weight (which paper manufacturers would soon adjust to provide an equivalent amount of script) and that a scheme could be devised which would involve the Post Office in no loss, and would at the same time put the Company in the position of requiring relatively much lower Subsidy.During the Chairman&apos;s recent tour of the African Route he was impressed most by the great appreciation of the value of the Air Mail by all communities along the route. The only adverse comment appeared to be the amount of the air mail fee, which, it appears, can only be reduced if the volume carried is greatly increased.The Board believes that no other Company has such a low subsidy, as a percentage of total receipts, as Imperial Airways. Some indica-tive figures of the Company&apos;s progress in this direction have already been given in analysis, but, even taking the Company&apos;s operations as a whole, and including the newly-opened South African Route, the percentage of subsidy to total revenue (including subsidy) is estimated for the current year ending next month to be about 50%.No authentic information with regard to Foreign Companies has, to the Board&apos;s knowledge, been published, but the Board believes that no other Company is as near to payability without subsidies as Imperial Airways. According to unofficial information, the subsidies granted to the German Company the Deutsche Luft Hansa amount to about 63% of their total revenue; the Pan American Airways&apos; subsidies (Mail contracts operated at a loss to the U.S. Postal Adminis-tration) amount, it is believed, to about 65% of the total revenue, and it should be remembered that the only foreign Air Service operating internationally in a wide sense, which compares in &quot; standard of service &quot; generally to Imperial Airways, is Pan American Airways. The Dutch Company, the K.L.M., as far as can be roughly estimated, receives about 54% of its revenue by subsidies. In the case of the latter Company, without doubt the nearest to Imperial Airways in this respect, it should be remembered that it does not as yet provide as high a standard of service for passengers as Imperial Airways, although
there arc clear indications that the Dutch Company recognises the importance of developing passenger and other traffic as a means of lowering the subsidy.The Board of Imperial Airways believes that the time is ripe for all H.M. Governments concerned to consider now the possibility of carrying letter mail in bulk between certain units of the Empire by air. Such a plan requires an immense amount of investigation and study, which will take time, and the Board submits to H.M. Govcrn-mcnt that, if the continuity of progress in Empire Air Communications, already started by H.M. Government through the medium of Imperial Airways is to be maintained, there is little enough time before the expiry of the Company&apos;s existing agreements to establish such a plan, including provision of aircraft, as a co-operative Empire scheme, in which all the communities of the Empire could co-operate as partners.SUMMARY AND  SUGGESTIONS.The Board wishes, therefore, to summarise as follows : A. The time has come when the future of the Civil Air Communications of the Empire should be considered in an orderly manner but without delay.B. Inaction until, say, 1938 the mean year when the agreements expire would jeopardise the high position and status of British Civil Aviation in the world to-day, and would involve a period of sterility and lack of progress, which should be avoided.C. Imperial Airways was, and still is, the chosen instrument of His Majesty&apos;s Government for fifteen years&apos; experimental progress, of which nine years have expired, and the Board submits that, with the never-failing help and co-operation of the Air Ministry, it has creditably fulfilled its function in efficiency and economy, and progressively towards a high development in Air Communications. Its shareholders have received less than a fair commercial return on their investment, and the policy of the Board has been conservative in the extreme and directed to the improvement of the fleet rather than to showing high profits. The possibility of raising further capital on the open market is, however, very germane to the present consideration.
D. Regrettable as it is that air communications should still require subsidy, this appears unavoidable under present conditions. All great countries subsidise their National Civil Aviation, and the Commonwealth of Nations forming the British Empire would lose prestige if its air routes were allowed to retrogress, or were undertaken by Foreign Powers, or subsidised foreign Companies. Such a policy is unthinkable, and the Taxpayers of the Empire are, at any rate, through Imperial Airways, getting better value for their subsidy than are the Taxpayers of any other nation.E.- Those British communities which have so far benefited by the celerity of the air-mail service have already adopted it as a part of their life and domestic arrangements. To deprive them of it now appears almost impossible, and the Board has submitted in outline, schemes and proposals which will link every considerable part of the Empire in the air-mail scheme.F. The great self-governing Dominions should be invited to come in as full partners in the Empire Air Chain. The regrettable alternative would be the partial disintegration of the Empire air routes, and their sectionalisation under different ownerships, which would be wasteful, inefficient and inimical to full development. A poor consummation indeed of an ideal which we have all had in mind for years.G. The Board thinks that, in great measure, the future of air communications within the Empire lies in Marine aircraft, and that we should return or, rather, lean more and more to our national heritage, the Sea. The influence of our Naval power in the past centuries has provided us with marine airports, on a scale to which no other country can aspire. Such a policy as is forecast has many political, economic and technical advantages, which cannot be equalled in the development of land-aircraft services in our Empire communications, or anywhere else.H. Imperial Airways has conclusively demonstrated its reliability and dependability already, and the Board has every confidence in its ability to carry a vastly increased volume of Empire letter mail. The Board therefore invites H.M. Government to investigate, in conjunction with Imperial Airways, the carriage by air, of letter mail in bulk  on the London-Cape Town and  London-Australasia
routes in the next four or five years&apos; time, on revised rates of conveyance to be negotiated.i. the board is of the opinion that, given its proper place as bulk mail carriers, a place which is justified by its past record, the airways of the british empire can operate at a vastly decreased cost and possibly later, it is hoped, without direct cost to the taxpayer.j. the board submits that, in the interests of the proper and progressive development of imperial airways, and of feeder services, far greater permanence of tenure is necessary than has been hitherto rightly accorded in the now concluding experimental period. the time is fast approaching when the rate of obsolescence of aircraft will slow down, and long-term contracts will become increasingly economical.k. the board submits to h.m. government that, as so many interests are concerned, and the time is by no means too generous, a departmental committee should be set up now, to review the whole question.it is needless to say that if the managing director, consulting engineer, or officers of imperial airways can assist, they are available to act either as advisers or consultants to such a committee. the board has the greatest desire to help h.m. government to use the potentialities of the air, and to consolidate and benefit the empire.l. in the opinion of the board, this memorandum deals with one of the most important factors in binding the empire together, and the board hopes that, if it has convinced the secretary of state, that this is a matter of prime and urgent importance, he will take such steps as he considers necessary for its early and exhaustive consideration.ERIC GEDDES,Chairman.27th March, 1933.
