THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET- COPY NO. 3 9QK P. 107/33).CABINET..ANGLO-DANISH NEGOTIATIONS.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a note prepared in the Board of Trade on the provisional agreement which may be reached as a result of the Anglo-Danish Commercial Negotiations.     The Danish Delegation will be received tomorrow,, and if they come to terms with us on the lines indicated in the attached note, I hope I may have authority to conclude an agreement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    In that event I should wish to make an announcement, probably in answer to a private notice question, on Wednesday 12th April in the following terms:-&quot;I am happy to be able to announce that the heads of an agreement have now been reached with the Danish Government.     There are still a number of teohniual points and details of drafting to be settled so that the formal signature and publication of the agreement cannot take place until after Easter.     Until that time I cannot say more than that the Agreement provides for concessions covering a wide range of United Kingdom export trade to Denmark, in return for concessions accorded by this country on a range of goods   of special interest to Denmark&quot;,W.R.Board of Trade,ll*h April, 1933.
ANGLO-DANI3E mj&amp;0TIATI0N3. Note prepared in the Board of Trade, The present position may he summarised as follows:-The Danish Offer,1.    Coal and Coke,     The United Kingdom share of Denmark&apos;s coal imports was 96., 6$ in 1924, 43.5$ in 1931 and 58.2% in 1932.    The Danes have offered to guarantee that the United Kingdom share of Denmark&apos;s coal imports shall he raised to 80%.   This represents on 1931 figures an increase of nearly 1,325,000 tons or an Increased employment of 5,300 men at the pit..As regards coke,  the United Kingdom share of Denmark&apos;s imports was 89.9% in 1924, 63,9% in 1931, and 68% in 19320 The Danish Delegation are unable to offer a definite guarantee relating to imports on coke, but will probably agree to a clause in general terms to the effect that, it being the hope of both Governments that the existing share of the Danish market for coke should continue to be enjoyed by the United Kingdom, both Governments will enter into consultation, if the case require, with a view to the maintenance of that situation.2.    Iron and Steel.    The Danes are prepared to agree to* a general understanding that for Government purchases, and also for Municipal purchases in so far as these can be influenced by the Government, the first offer of orders for iron and steel shsell be made to United Kingdom firms, coupled,  in the case of Government purchases, with a price preference of 10%, and that in addition private purchasers shall be urged to give the first offer of orders for iron and steel to the United Kingdom wherever possible.   The groups of.iron and steel products to which this understanding would relate are:- pig iron; plates (black, tinned, and galvanized); drawn and rolled tubes; and cast iron pipes and fittings.
The understanding would be embodied in an agreed memorandum to be sent with a covering note by the Danish Minister in London to H.M.Government.     It is expected that the understanding will raise tne Danish purchase of United Kingdom iron and steel from the level of approximately 50,000 tons in 1931 and 1932 to at least 80,000 tons.3.    Jute. Salt, Saltpetre, and Parchment Paper; Definite arrangements have been made, or are in process of conclusion, between trade organisations in Denmark and in the United Kingdom by which the associations of Danish producers undertake to purchase from the United Kingdom the whole of the jute wrappers, salt, and saltpetre used in preparing and marketing bacon exported from Denmark to the United Kingdom,and the whole of the salt and parchment paper used in preparing and packing butter exported from Denmark to the United Kingdom. The estimate^ effect on United Kingdom trade is an increase in the value of our exports of these articles to Denmark from approximately  45,000 in 1931 to something over  100,000.4.    Danish Customs Tariff.    The general level of the Danish tariff is low and substantial reductions were not to be expected.     The Denes have, however, offered reductions on a number of articles, and have also offered an undertaking that the duties on most of the important classes of our exports to Denmark shall be conventionalised.      The total value of imports from the United Kingdom into Denmark in 1931 was 219 million Kr. ( 12,000,000 at par).      Of this the value in 1931 of the trade covered by reductions now offered was approximately l\ million Kr.  ( 410,000 at par) and that covered by conventionalisation about 94 million Kr.  (ever  5,000,000 at $ar).      The requests refused amount to approximately 25 million Kr.  1,350,000 at par).
The following are the principal items covered by the tariff concessionsReductionsPrinted cotton piece goods,Certain unbleached cotton piece goods,Pelt hats,Carpeting (piece goods), Photographic plates, Marmalade and Apricot Jam, Pickles,Biscuits and cakes.In addition the Danes have agreed to alter the basis of the import duties on motor cars in a manner that will benefit British trade.Convent i onalisat ionsr-All cotton and wool piece goods (other than those covered by reductions),Certain classes of linen piece goods,V/ool stockings,Cotton thread,Undyed worsted yarn for weaving, wnisky and gin, Artificial asphalt, Gramophones and phonographs, Linoleum, Sewing machines,Tractors (without motor ploughs), Link bolt chains, ard Cleaning and polishing materials. They have also offered to conventionalise free entry for coal and coke, jute cloth wrappers and sacKs, and the principal classes of iron and steel.As regards cotton and wool piece goods, the Danes have explained that they are apprehensive of their market being flooded by imports of cheap goods from Central European-3-
countries or from Japan.    They have therefore said that their offer to conventionalise the present duties is subject to the inclusion of a clause in the agreement by which, if the imports of any class of these goods from non-British countries increases by more than 25 per cent, over any period of six months, they would be at liberty to approach us with proposals for any measures that nay be necessary, after July 1st, 12 35, with a view to preserving or restoring an economic level of prices.Points outstanding.    The Danes have not met requests for conventionalisation of the existing duties on cotton yarn for weaving and on motor cycles, and for reductions on certain clashes of boots and shoes.    The first two of these requests relate to important classes of trade in which the United Kingdom holds a large proportion of the Danish market and will be pressed.    In boots and shoes on the other hand our share in the Danish market is very much smaller.Commercial Travellers&apos; Licences.Commercial travellers doing business in Denmark have to obtain a licence, paying a fee of 300 Kr. for a licence for one year or 100 Kr. for a licence for 35 days.    This is disadvantageous to t ravellers from the United Kingdom who normally do not stay in Denmark for more than a fortnight at a time,   A core ess ion has been obtained from the Danes by which such travellers can obtain a licence valid for 15 days on payment of a reduced fee of 40 Kr,THE UNITED KINGDOM OFFER. Denmark&apos;s exports to the United Kingdom consist mainly of agricultural products and fish,    Bacon, butter and eggs between them,  represented about 95% of tho value of our imports from Denmark in 1932.Bacon and Ham.    We have offered tho Danes a guarantee that in ;xny system of regulation of imports, the Danish quota shall
be, not  less th&apos;.n 62% of the- total foreign supplies.    \ic have .\lso offered -.;n undertaking not to impose an import duty on bacon and ham.Butter.    We h-.vr offered an undertaking not to increase the duty above the present rate of 15/- per cwt.  (Ottawa duty). We have also offered the Dines a guaranteed minimum import of 2.3 million cwt., which is the maximum possible consistent with a contemplated reduction of Imports which may be imposed at the instance of Australia and New Zealand.     The Danes are pressing for a minimum of 2.4 million, but this figure is out of the question in view of an assurance which has already been given to Australia and New Zealand.Eggs.     We have offered the convent! onalisations of the present duties which were fixed under the Ottawa Agreements; but here again the possibility of restrictions on imports arises.   The average imports from Denmark during the last three years have heen nearly 7 million great hundreds, and they asked for a guaranteed minimum of 5^- million great hundreds. The Ministry of Agriculture are opposed to including any definite figure.for eggs in an agreement with Denmark, and are not prepared, in any event, to offer a guaranteed minimum higher than 4 million great hundreds,  representing a reduction of more, than 40 per cent, on the average Danish imports in the last three years,    ^t seems clear that the Danes will not be satisfied unless they get some figure.     The Board of Trade have suggested that the offer should be increased if this should prove necessary, in order to obtain agreement, to a figure not exceeding 5 million great hundreds; the Ministerof Agriculture has promised to consider the question further before the Cabinet meets.Fish.     The Danes have been offered conventionalisation of the present 10 per cent, duty, together with a guarantee that if restrictions are imposed on imports, the Danish quota
CO,000 ionalmen 0ional000000)0,000shall be not less than 90 per cent, of their average supplies for the last three years.   This offer appears to satisfy them.Other products.     The Danes have also been offered reduction of the duties on soap flakes, milk churns and stoves for domestic heating, and conventionalisation of the duties on certain Kinds of dairy machinery, cocoanut oil, yeast, rennet, annatto,  certain varieties    of grass 3eed,  and certain medicinal preparations.   The value in 1931 of the trade affected was less than  400,000.The above offers maybe summarised as follows:-Danish Offer.1.   Coal.    Guarantee to purchase 30 per cent, of total of Danish imports from this country,  equivalent on 1931 figures to an additional 5,300 men.2* Iron and Steel. Aji understanding which should lead to an increase in Denmark&apos;s purchases of United Kingdom iron and steel by   30,000 tons.3.    Increased purchases of jute, salt,  saltpetre, and parchment paper wrapping, and increased trade of approximately  60,000.4.   Reductions or modification of duty on goods, the import of which into Sweden from the United Kingdom in 1931 was  410,000.    The amount of increased employment cannot be estimated, but the reduction should lead to increased trade.5.    Consolidation of free entry or of present duties (mostly low) on goods the import of which into Denmark from the United Kingdom in 1931 was over  5,000,000.6.    Substantial reduction in the fee levied on Commercial Travellers visiting Denmark.&apos; &quot;7.   No concession offered on requests covering  1,350,000 of Uniced Kingdom imports in 1931.
United J-ingdom offer.1.   Reductions of duties on industrial products, imports of which into the United Kingdom from Denmark in 75,000 1931 were  75,000.2.    Conventionalisation of free entry or of present duties -on agricultural and industrial products, the import of which into the United Kingdom from Denmark in 20,000 1931 was  320,000,3.    Conventionalisation of free entry or of present duties, with actual or potential restriction on imports, in the case of agricultural products and fish, the import of which into the United Kingdom from Denmark in 3,385,000 1931 was  43,385,000.4.   No concession offered on requests covering  1,000,000 of the Danish imports in 1931.
