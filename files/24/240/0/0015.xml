THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   Ajyril 1933.Copy No.    40CABINET.PRODUCE MARKETS SITUATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.IT has been suggested by one or two of my colleagues that a review of the general produce situation would be useful in view of the many proposals and schemes now in operation or under consideration.I have grouped below the main items and indicated the situation as regards each group and the approximate annual value of the supplies involved. The review is primarily directed to the situation in England and Wales, but necessarily in respect of market supply deals with Great Britain as a whole. I have worked throughout in close collaboration with the Secretary of State for Scotland, but there are, of course, several matters of special concern to Scotland which are not reviewed in this paper.The meat situation remains serious as regards beef, but has improved considerably as regards all other meats. Much more serious is the dairy produce situation, and I would direct the special attention of my colleagues to the section of this Memorandum dealing with milk products. The situation on the egg market is deteriorating and likely to require action to avert a price crisis in the coming autumn.This review indicates the extent to which our agricultural policy has been developed in accordance with Government announcements. Possible tariff trace developments were reviewed in a meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, at which Sir F. Leith-Ross was also present, on Thursday, the 13th April, prior to the departure of the Prime Minister to the United States, and the necessity for safeguarding the orderly development of our policy was agreed and communicated to our Ambassador at Washington in a telegram of the same date.The regulation of most of the main supplies to our markets is secured by this reservation, but this may not be held to apply to the case of oats, which has been before the Import Duties Advisory Committee since last October, and on which a pronouncement is due immediately after the 8th May. I am very anxious that the possibility of an early increase in the rate of duty on imported oats and oat products should not be prejudiced by a tariff truce, in view of the length of time that this application has been under consideration, the critical position of the oat-growers, and the fact that careful investigation has failed to disclose any other remedial measures.A policy on fish has been agreed with the Secretary of State for Scotland and the President of the Board of Trade. The policy has been discussed with representatives of the home industry who have indicated their acceptance, and with representatives of the foreign countries chiefly affected, who have accepted stipulations in the Trade Agreements affording room for its embodiment. The policy is given in further detail at a later point in this memorandum.[8534] bSECRET. CP. 115 (33).

About 15.000 tons has been taken off the market as compared with supplies for the comparable 6 months last year. Present supplies are coming in for this quarter, by arrangement, at about 2 per cent, below the permitted Ottawa figure. A larger percentage reduction has been arranged for the September quarter, when supplies from home sources will be heavier.Foreign mutton and lamb and frozen beef are subject to the Ottawa reduction of 15 per cent., which will be increased to 20 per cent, next quarter.Dominion mutton and lamb is pegged during 1933, by the Ottawa Agreements, to the quantities shipped in the basic year (July 1931-June 1932).Dominion frozen beef, in 19.33, will not show more than a 10 per cent, increase on the basic year quantities.Effect on Supplies and Prices. In the period November 1932 to March 1933 imports of beef, mutton and lamb were some 16.600 tons less than in the corresponding period of 1931-32. In the same period, an increased home-production of meat (estimated at about per cent, in the case of beef and 1\ per cent, in the case of mutton and lamb) has had to be accommodated. Prices up to mid-April have responded as follows : Prices of fat cattle have appreciated by 14 per cent., but are still 39.*. 3d. per live cwt. as against 45s. 5d. this time last year. Fat sheep are up by 61 per cent, but are only 10\d. per lb. as against 9f^- this time last year. Fat pigs are up by 34 per cent., but are only 12s. 3id. per score as against 11.9. 3id. this time last year. Whereas wholesale prices of home-produced meat have improved in accordance with the appreciation which has taken place in the values of fat stock since last November, prices of imported meat show little change except as regards the less popular cuts, which were reported to be practically unsaleable in October 1932. For example, prices for home killed meat per lb. in the last six months have moved as follows : Beef from 6frf. to 7d.; mutton from 5Jrf. to 9d.; lamb from 6xrf. to 12^d.; pork from 6%d. to 8\d. Typical movements in prices of imported meat (per lb.) over the same period have been as follows : Argentine chilled (hinds) from 5%d. to 5%d.; (fores) from 2fd. to 3ftf.; Australian frozen beef (hinds) from 3\d. to 3id.; (fores) from 2%d. to 3%d.; New Zealand mutton from 3%d. to 4-irf.; New Zealand lamb from 5fd. to 5frf. Retail prices show no appreciable change except for an increase of let. or 2d. per lb. in some classes of bacon.The Argentine Trade Agreement. Under the new Agreement, we are free to reduce imports of chilled beef by 10 per cent, below the Ottawa level in any vear, in order to secure a remunerative level of prices, with a proviso that increased imports of meat from other sources should not be allowed to neutralise the intended effect. We are also free to deduce beyond the 10 per cent, figure with the same object in view, provided that other supplying countries (including Empire countries), make a comparable contribution.Domestic Reorganisation. Reorganisation Commissions have been set up in England and in Scotland to prepare schemes, under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931, for regulating the marketing of fatstock. It is not anticipated that these will report before the autumn.Pigmeat.Imports of bacon and hams from. foreign sources continue to be regulated under a &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement &quot; between the chief foreign exporting countries concerned. As a result, imports of bacon and hams in the period November 1932 to March 1933 were some 31,000 tons less than in the corresponding period of 1931-32.
310The reduction of imports has had the desired effect of raising wholesale bacon prices, which in 19:12 had reached a very low level. English Wiltshire (green) bacon, for example, is now quoted at 95.*. per cwt. as compare;&apos; with 65*. at the beginning of November last year.Under the Agreement just concluded, the Danes have been guaranteed a minimum of 62 per cent, of total permitted foreign imports, but the Governments policy in regard to the development of the home bacon industry has been fully safeguarded.As an integral part of the programme, home farmers and curers have submitted schemes under the Agricultural Marketing Act. 1931. for regulating the marketing of pigs and bacon respectively in Great Britain; these should be in operation early in July. The Agricultural Marketing Bill will enable organisation to be carried a step further by means of a development scheme for rationalising bacon production.Dairy Produce.Milk and cream  Total.Fresh       ... 41-73Preserved ... 8-9Butter            ... 47-4Cheese            ... 15 -1Value of Supplies to United Kiiigdom.

I mentioned that the situation was under close consideration by the Dominions Secretary, the President of the Board of Trade and myself and I indicated that it might be desirable to consider temporary arrangements to steady the markets in dairy products. I regret, however, to report that our efforts to secure a restriction of imports of butter by voluntary agreement with Australia and New Zealand failed, and the market is thus open to unrestricted supplies from the Dominions for three years.It is necessary to deal with milk products as a whole owing to the interaction of demand and to the necessity for safeguarding the position in regard to those products, such as cheese, of which we are substantial producers. The situation is rapidly becoming worse, and it is important that every step which is still possible should be taken with the objects, firstly, of introducing stability into the market for milk products as a whole, and, secondly, of securing an increase in the level of prices of, at anjr rate, those products in. which the home industry is particularly interested.The estimated home output of milk in 1930-31 was 1,425 million gallons of which 66 per cent, was consumed as liquid milk.The milk equivalents of imports of milk products represent about twice the total milk production of Great Britain, the figures being 2,600 million gallons (whole milk), and 106 million gallons (skimmed milk).Imports in 1932 showed an increase of nearly 16 per cent, over the average for the three years 1929-31 due almost entirely to greater imports of butter. Stocks in this country are accumulating at an alarming rate as is shown by the following-figures of the liquid milk equivalent of stocks of home-produced milk products held by three large firms: A year ago: 5-7 million gallons. A month ago : 18 million gallons.An increase of over 200 per cent.. - -The immediate urgency of the matter from the standpoint of home agricul-ture derives from the fact that the scheme of milk reorganisation, which is expected to come into operation in September next, is based on the principle[8534] v. 2
of the pooling of returns from sales for liquid consumption and for manufacture, [ts success will, therefore, depend very largely on an improvement in the market for manufacturing milk. Whereas the price of milk for liquid consumption is about Is. 0d. a gallon, the average price of milk for manufacturing has fallen from 9c?. in 1925-26 to 5d. at the present time and even at this figure the manufacture of some products is uneconomic.I shall  therefore be glad of the authority of my colleagues for myDepartment,  in  conjunction  with  other  Departments  concerned,  to  open negotiations with supply countries, with a yiew to arranging for a considerablerestriction of imports of milk products into this country.I should be prepared, if desired by my colleagues, further to explore plans which I have already been considering in outline for utilising surplus stocks in this country, but these would necessarily involve expenditure from public funds.Eggs and Poultry.Value of Supplies to tTiiited Kingdom. (Million  .)&apos;Imported.Total. Home. Empire. Foreign.Eggs ...      34-2 22-4 2-9 8-9Poultry        ...        9-7 7-2 -7 1-8A combination of circumstances is likely to lead to the concentration on this market of heavy supplies of eggs in the coming autumn and winter. Egg produc-tion is expanding rapidly in several Southern Hemisphere countries whose glut season corresponds with the time when production in this country is at its lowest. This expansion is particularly marked in the case of Australia, whose exports to this country in the last two seasons have increased annually by 70 per cent, and an increase on at least the same scale is anticipated in the coming season. Supplies from Southern Hemisphere sources are chilled and of high quality : they are directly competitive with home supplies. It is estimated that total imports of chilled eggs next autumn and winter will increase from about 400 to 600 million eggs, an increase of 50 per cent.The position is likely to be further aggravated by increased supplies of fresh and preserved eggs from European countries. This year, the German market for eggs has been virtually closed to exporting countries and our import duties, now conventionalised, can no longer be expected to check supplies from Continental countries as they did last year.The effect on the home industry of substantially increased imports during the autumn and winter is likely to be serious. The United Kingdom market has always, of course, been in a glutted state in the Spring, not only because of the seasonal increase in the home output, but also because of the large increase in the exportable surpluses of other Northern Hemisphere countries at that time. With the rapid development of poultry husbandry in the Southern Dominions, the United Kingdom market is now being required to absorb larg;e and increasing surpluses during our autumn and winter, when the home producer has some right to expect comparatively remunerative returns to compensate him for the seasonal reduction in his output. The whole position is receiving close attention, and inter-Departmental discussions are at present taking place.Eggs, like bacon, have been prominent in the recent negotiations with the Danish Trade Delegation. Under the Agreement, the Danes have been promised that if imports of eggs are regulated their allocation will be not less than o\ million great hundreds a year, but we are free to reduce this figure if necessary. The Danish share of total foreign imports, however, will in no case be less than 38 per cent., which was the Danish proportion in the three-year period 1930-32.The home industry has made a request, which is now being considered by the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself, for the constitution of a Reorganisa-tion Commission, under the Agricultural Marketing Act, to prepare schemes for regulating the marketing of eggs and poultry.
Cereals.Value of Supplies to United Kingdom. (Million  ,)Imported.Total. Home. Empire.       Foreign. -Wheat (including flour)   ...      42-9 6-9 25-2 10-8Barley   ... ... ...       9-3 6-3 -8 2-2Oats      ... ... ...      17-8 160 -8 1-0Wheat.The world price of wheat stands at 33 per cent, below pie-war and the outlook on the world market is gloomy. The &quot;carry-over&quot; of old crop wheat in exporting countries in August next will probably, of itself, equal the total demand of importing countries in the ensuing cereal year. Home wheat growers are now insulated from the effects of these disastrous conditions by the Wheat Act, 1932, which gives them, on the average, a standard price of 45*. per qr., representing an increase of about 33 per cent, over pre-war values. Payments to growers to date exceed  2 million. The Act, though necessarily complicated, has worked smoothly, thanks to the competence of the Wheat Commission and the willing co-operation of all the interests concerned.Barley.The undertaking given to the Chancellor by the Brewers&apos; Society, as part of the Budget arrangements, to recommend all brewers to increase, as far as possible, the proportion of home-grown barley in the brewing of all classes of beer, may be expected to assist growers of malting barley, whose market has, of late, been in a seriously depressed condition. Arrangements are being made to bring together representatives of brewers, maltsters, merchants and farmers with the object of devising a plan for implementing the brewers&apos; undertaking.Oats.The Import Duties Advisory Committee will in all probability recommend at an early date an increase in the duties on oat products. They are also considering an application for an increased duty on foreign oats. If an increased duty is granted, its value to home growers will largely depend on an understanding being reached with the Canadian Government for the stabilisation of Canadian exports at recent levels. In 1932-33 to date, Canadian supplies have accounted for 42 per cent, of the imports of oats from all sources, compared with less than 10 per cent, in 1930-31. There is no doubt that, with an additional preference, Canadian exports to this market would very greatly increase. This question is being taken up with the Dominions Office.I have referred above to the importance of ensuring that the position with regard to an increased duty on oats should not be prejudiced by a tariff truce.Sugar.Value of Supplies to United Kingdom. (Million  .)Imported.Total. Home.       Empire.       Foreign.Sugar      ... ... 23-0 4-7 7-5 10-8The British Sugar (Subsidy) Act, 1925, comes to an end next year, and the sugar-beet crop now being sown is the last that will benefit from its provisions, which have been little short of a life-line to arable farmers, particularly in the Eastern Counties. The world-price of raw sugar has fallen disastrously from 21s. 9rf. per cwt., when the Act was being framed, to 5*. Qd. per cwt., and the calculations on which the Act was based no longer have validity. A decision as to the future of the sugar-beet industry will shortly have to be taken by the Government. Meanwhile, a reconciliation has been effected between the various groups of beet-sugar manufacturers, and between them and the refiners. An industrial agreement has been drawn up and a marketing scheme is being-prepared, which will probably come forward under the Agricultural Marketing
Act, 1931. Most likely, use will also be made of the rationalisation provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Bill. Inter-Departmental discussions are proceeding with the Treasury, with whose sanction these steps have been taken.Horticultural Products.Value of Supplies to United Kingdom, (Miiliou  .)Imported.Total. Home. Empire.

As regards &quot; earlies,&quot; the Import Duties Advisory Committee have submitted a recommendation that the duty on old potatoes should be raised from  1 to  2 per ton up to the end of June during the current year, and that the duty should be raised from  1 to  2 per ton on all potatoes during the months of July and August.  This will help producers of &quot; earlies.&quot;A scheme for the regulation of the marketing of potatoes in Great Britain under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931, has been submitted and, if approved, will come into force in time for the marketing of the main crop this year.Fruit, Vegetables and Flowers.In substitution for the temporary duties imposed under the Horticultural Products Act, 1931, the Additional Import Duties No. 5 Order, 1932, imposed protective duties on a very wide range of horticultural products. As a result of both sets of duties, imports of most of the products affected were drastically reduced last year; the acreage of most of the principal vegetable crops showed an increase; the home production of early market-garden produce and of flowers has been stimulated; there has been considerable activity in the erection of new glasshouses; the position of growers of soft fruits and of nurserymen has been substantially improved.Canned Fruit.The industry, which is relatively new in this country, has rapidly expanded in recent years. The market for canned fruit has unfortunately become over-stocked as a result of a heavy increase in imports, which are mostly of kinds of fruit not produced in this country, though they are indirectly competitive.The home industry is examining plans for reorganisation and for the rationalisation of production, possibly under the Agricultural Marketing Act and the Agricultural Marketing Bill, and it may become necessary, at an early date, to consider whether any measures should be taken to relieve the market situation.The value of the home output exceeds  1 million. Home production represents 13 per cent, of total supplies of canned and bottled fruit of all kinds. Foreign imports carry a duty of 15 per cent, ad valorem in addition to the duty in respect of sugar content.Hops.The Chancellor announced, in his Budget Speech, the intention to continue for a further four years the present Customs duty of  4 per cwt., which has been a material factor in safeguarding the position of the industry. A scheme under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931. was brought into operation in September 1932 in time for last year&apos;s crop and is working successfully. The value of the home output is about  H million.
Fish.Value of Supplies to United Kingdom.(Million  &apos;.) Total. British caught.       Imported.Fish   ... ...       24-5 15-5 9-0I have already referred to the fact that a policy has been agreed with the Secretary of State for Scotland and the President of the Board of Trade and discussed with representatives of the home industry and with most of the foreign countries chiefly affected, who have accepted stipulations in the Trade Agreements affording room for its embodiment. Both the foreign countries and the home industry see certain positive advantages in the policy. The essential features are : Restriction of foreign imports of fish in conjunction with a greater restriction of British-caught fish, attained by (a) regulation of the mesh of nets to permit the escape of under-sized fish, coupled with the imposition of size limits below which fish may not be landed or sold in Great Britain; these measures are designed to combat the destruction of immature fish, which has been a growing evil for some years past; and(&amp;) the prohibition of the landing and sale in Great Britain during the summer months of fish taken from distant regions, such as Bear Island.The policy will require legislation, and an early statement on the subject is desirable.DECISIONS DESIRED.(1) Milk Products.That authority should be given for my Department, in conjunction with other Departments concerned, to open negotiations with supply countries, with a view to arranging for a considerable restriction of imports of milk products into this country.(2) Fish Policy.That authority should be given for an early statement on the policy outlined above in regard to the regulation of fish supplies.(Initialled)      W. E. E.Ministry of Aqriculture and Fisheries, April 28, 1933.
