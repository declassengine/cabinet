O1&apos;! ^(THIS; LX)CUIvIENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.) S 5  ORE T.CP.  117(53) . COPY NO:     ^ ^C A B I N E T. THE JUDICIAL VACANCY -MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR.In November,  1927, Lord Cave circulated to the Cabinet a memorandum CP.  278(27), proposing that an address should be moved in both Houses under the Judicature Act of 1925,  for the appointment of two additional Judges in the King&apos;s Bench Division.    The Cabinet approved the proposal and the resolutions were passed,  the address was presented on the 14th February,  1928,  and Mr. Justice Charles and Mr. Justice Humphreys were appointed accordingly on the 17th and 18th February,  1928.    This brought the number of Puisne Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division from 15 up to 17.By the operation of the Judicature Act of 1925 the resolution thus passed had effect for twelve months and, therefore, when Mr. Justice Salter died towards the end of 1928 it was not necessary to have recourse again to Parliament,  and on the 14th December,  1928, -. r. Justice Macnaughten was appointed in his place,   thereby bringing the number of Puisne Judges again up to 17.In October,  1929, Mr. Justice Shearman resigned and the vacancy so created remained,  for motives of economy, unfilled, until 1952.    The hope that the remaining 16 Judges would be able to carry on the work adequately had ere then proved unfounded, as explained in the memorandum which I circulated to the Cabinet on the 22nd January, 1952.    The Cabinet approved my proposal that an address be moved for the appointment of an additional Judge in the King&apos;s Bench Division;    the resolutions were passed,  and the address presented on the 16th February, 1932.   Mr. Justice du Parcq
was appointed accordingly, on the 22nd February 1952.Shortly afterwardsj the elevation of Lord Wright and the retirement of Mr,, Justice Rowlatt, left two vacancies, which were filled without recourse to Parliament, in April 1932, thus bringing the number of Puisne Judges again to 17. At this figure it remained until the death of Mr. Justice McCardie, on the 26th April 1933, and the present vacanc3r necessitates a review of the state of business,  since, for the filling of the vacancy, an address is necessary.The appointment of two additional Judges in 1928 effected an immediate improvement in the position which was maintained until Mr. Justice Shearman&apos;s retirement in October 1929, and that from then onwards it became progressively worse.The improvement was shown by comparing the figures for 1927 with those for 1928.   These show that the number of actions tried by the Judges in the year rose from 1,093 to 1,203, and that the cases left over at the end of the year dropped from 1,017 to 851.The improvement was nearly maintained in 1929, although more cases were entered during the course of the year.After that, the position became distinctly worse, as may be most concisely shown by the following short table of cases for trial in the king Bench Division:-		1950.	1951.	1932.Actions	awaiting trial on 1st January	883	1160	1189Actions	entered for trial during year	2525	2414	2828Actions	tried during year	1001	1071	1372Actions	otherwise disposed of	1247	1314	1592Arrears	on 31st December	1160	1189	12oo
Notwithstanding the great increase in trials (notably last year, when an additional Judge was appointed and the New Procedure system introduced) and notwithstanding the increase in settlements out of Court (which arise largely by reason of the long delays in trial) the arrears thus continue to mount - by nearly 50 per cent in three years.The table shows alike the aid given by the appointment of an additional Judge early in 1932, and the imperative necessity of maintaining the number of Judges as it was until this week.The table does not include the whole of the work of the King&apos;s Bench Judges, but the figures relating to the other part afford no alleviation.The statistics of cases av/waiting trial under thehead of the Divisional Court (in which two or more Judgessit)  show - 120 on the 1st January 1928 154 at the beginning of 1952 and217 at the start of this year. Similarly in divorce cases at assizes, where the relative numbers of cases disposed of were 15C0,  1554, and 1514.The New Procedure,  to which reference has been made, was introduced in the middle of 1932, and has had the effect of speeding up cases in which it is appropriate; it involves work at high pressure,  and its efficacy would be greatly impaired by lack of judicial man power, while it is on its trial.A Business of Courts Committee is sitting, and has issued an interim report;    steps are being taken to carry out its recommendations; some of which will involve
legislation, &quot;but the effect of these cannot be known for some time after they come into operation, and their success would be imperilled by any aggravation of the situation as it existed up to the 25th of April.If the vacancy is now filled bringing the number of Puisne Judges up to 17 and the number of King&apos;s Bench Judges,  including the Lord Chief Justice, up to 18;    if an- average number of cases are entered during the year and an average number are disposed of out of Court;    if there is no illness among: the Judges, and if a Judge gets through 70 cases -in a year (which is rather above the average), not counting divisional court work or work on circuit, there will remain over at the end of 1933 at least 1,000 cases.I cannot,  therefore, hold out any hope that the amount soent on Commissioners of Assize will be seriously diminished by the appointment of an additional Judge, but it one were not appointed, the amount spent on Commissioners would be seriously increased.It is, however, noteworthy, that in the year 1931 (when there was no acditional Judge) 9 Commissioners were appointed at a cost of  3,018, although one was un-paid, while in 1932 (when Mr. Justice du Parcq was appointed) only 4 Commissioners were appointed at a cost of  1750.The estimated cost of appointing a new Judge is as follows.      The statutory salary is . 5,000 per annum. This has been reduced by the Economy Act to  4,000 per annum.      The income tax on this salary, at the present rate, amounts to  1,000.      In addition surtax reduces the net salary to a figure between  2,000 and  3,000.      To the net salary must be added the salary of the Judge&apos;s clerk, namely  400   per annum carrying Civil Service bonus.
Up to this moment there has not been tine for me to consult the Lord Chief Justice, but I have written to him and I hope to be in possession of his views before the Cabinet meets.(intd.)     S.H our; e of L o rds,1 S. V/. 1.May 1st, 1933.5.
