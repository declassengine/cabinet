^DOCu^gHT IS THE PRO PER TV. OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY5 S GOVERNMENT.:I,opal Gov^rrmiiQat-Lay;: Cj^iaoiidafe1013 Memorandum by Mini a toy of Health -I desire to obtain Cabinet approval to the introduction into the House ox&quot; Lords of &amp; Bill to cony oxidate, with minor amendments, the law relating to local government in England and Waleso     The Bill is Included in the list of bills reported by the Homo Affairs Committee to the Cabinet in November of last year..  - 0        The Bill is the outcome of an Interim Report of a Departmental Committee appointed in 1929 by Mr, Greenwood, with the late Lord Chelmsford as Chairman, to consider and report on the form which a consolidation of the law of local government and public health should take and the amendments which would be desirable to secure simplicitys uniformity and concisenesso     The Committee includes three members of Parliament representing the three Parties and representatives of the four Associations of Lena! Authorities.   Copies of the Report and of a draft Local Government Bill appended to it are annexed.30        The Bill has no application to Snot/and or Northern Ireland and with certain exceptions excludes London, which is largely governed, both as regards local government and public health- by a code of its own.     It embraces the whole.law relating to the constitutions elections and general powers and duties of local authoritiesf 1,8,, councils of counties, boroughs, urban and rural districts and parishes.     It does not deal with specific duties such us education or housings these being left to their own codes *JRETCABINET.
4. The Bill represents In the main a consolidation;v&quot; the existing law, but as the Committee have pointed out in their Report (paragraph 8), it Is impossible to asslmilat tho divergent codes without a re-writing of the statutes which in many cases goes bey end the sphere of pure tonsoxidationa     The nature of the amendments introduced by the committee  Is detailed in their Report.     The extant to which tho Bill shortens tho law may be judged from the fact that it wholly repeals 47 Acts and partially repeals a further 172, and substitutes 301 clauses and 11 Schedules for over 900 sections and 35 Schedules now scattered over th Statute Book which are either wholly or partially&apos;repealed * The Bill representsj therefore, an immense simplification of the law and, as such- the published draft has already bee warmly welcomed in the local government press,,     The confusion and prolixity of the law relating to local government and public health are notorious and have- long bee the subject of comment from the judicial bench and other quarters.     The removal of them should result In economy of legal charges, a sphere where economy would be generally welcomedo5o        The reasons why it Is advisable to deal with tho matter by means of a single consolidating and amending Bill instead of adopting the more usual procedure and passing an amending Bill as a preliminary to consolidation are set out In paragraph 3.0 of the Report.     Put shortly they are that If the various Acts are to be amalgamated into a single concise code the number of amendments is so large that tho amending Bill would be little shorter than the Bill now proposed -     Moreover such an amending Bill would be quite unintelligible.6c I should certainly not suggest the introduction of bill of this length in the present session if I thought that.
there were any danger of it proving contentious or blocking the progress of more urgent legislation.     That, however. Is not tho case.     It is true that the Bills not being a measure of pure consolidation, would not be automatically referred to the ,Toint Committee on Consolidation Bills;    but If it is introduced into tho House of Lords it could be referred to a Joint Solsct Committee of both Houses with a view to their examining and reporting on the ehanges In the law affected by the Bill.     If this course Is adopted, I anticipate that the number of points to which the Joint Committee would call a^tention would be relatively small, and that with the good-will of all parties the Bill would find Its way to the Statute Book&apos;.I have been urged by the Associations of Local Authorities to introduce consolidating measures of this type without delay, and I am convinced that the feeling of local authorities and of all concerned in local government is overwhelmingly in favour of it becoming law at the earliest, possible moment.7o The Secretary of State, whose Department isconcerned with tho Part of the Bill relating to Elections and with some other Clausesg has sasn and concurs In this paporc(Intld.)

LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH CONSOLIDATION COMMITTEE.INTERIM   REPORT.To Lieutenant-Commander The Right Honourable Sir Edwaiui Hilton Youno, P.C., G.B.E., D.S.O., D.S.C., M.P., Minister of Health.disclosure,1. We have the honour to submit herewith an Interim Report dealing with the law of local government, including the constitution and general functions of local authorities.INTRODUCTION.2. We were appointed, on the 8th December, 1930, by Mr.Arthur Greenwood, the then Minister of Health, to be a committee with the following Terms of Reference: &quot; With a view to the consolidation of the enactments applying to England and Wales (exclusive of London) and dealing with (a) local authorities and local government, and (6) matters relating to the public health, to consider under what heads these enactments should be grouped in consolidating legislation and what amendments of the existing law are desir-able for facilitating consolidation and securing simplicity, uniformity and conciseness.&quot;3. In addition to our Terms of Reference we had the advantage of a number of suggestions made by Mr. Greenwood in a letter dated the 8th December, 1930, and addressed to our Chairman, with regard to the scope of our inquiry and to convenient methods of procedure.   This letter indicated: (a) that the term &quot; local government &quot; was intended to cover the constitution and general functions of the various tj^pes of local authorities who administer the services usually known as local government services, that is to say, county councils, borough councils (including county borough councils), urban and rural district councils, parish councils and parish5688 A 4
meetings, but not particular functions of those authorities, such as education, housing, public assistance, lunacy and the like, each of which has its own code ; and(6) that the term &quot; enactments relating to the public health &quot; was not intended to be limited to the Public Health Acts themselves, hut to include analogous services such as those relating to maternity and child welfare and the welfare of the blind.Tho letter also suggested that we should regard as outside our province amendments of the law involving issues likely to provoke controversy, notwithstanding that such amendments might in some cases fall within the general objects of securing simplicity, uni-formity and conciseness.4. We have held 65 sittings and have dealt first with the statutes relating to local government.5. It may be convenient if we state briefly what our procedure has been. As we are primarily concerned with amendments of the law designed to facilitate consolidation and to secure simplicity, uniformity and conciseness, we have thought it both unnecessary and undesirable to invite the evidence of persons and bodies concerned in local government administration (evidence which must in any event have consisted largely of a repetition of the evidence pre-sented to the recent Royal Commission on Local Government under the chairmanship of the Earl of Onslow). We have accord-ingly confined ourselves mainly to a scrutiny of the Statute Book and of memoranda prepared for us and calling our atten-tion to cases of inconsistency, ambiguity, overlapping, and thc-like. In a single instance, to which we refer later, we invited representatives of the Association of Municipal Corporations to discuss with us some proposals relating to municipal boroughs which involved a greater departure from the existing law than the amendments which we have usually thought fit to consider. Moreover, in a number of instances we have taken into consideration amendments of the law recommended by the Royal Commission referred to above.6. In the course of our inquiry it quickly became apparent that the work of the Committee woidd be much hampered unless the Committee had before them at an early stage rough drafts of clauses indicating the form which the law would assume if our recom-mendations were adopted by Parliament, and the First Parlia-mentary Counsel, who is a member of the Committee, kindly under-took to have the necessary drafts prepared. These drafts have been, from time to time, revised, and have finally been thrown into the shape of a draft Bill, which accompanies this Report. Most of our recommendations will sufficiently appear from the Clauses of this Bill, and the Notes on Clauses which are appended to this
Report. There are, however, a number of points which demand fuller explanation and these are discussed in the following para-graphs. We have thought it unnecessary to encumber either the Report or the Notes on the Draft Clauses with references to minor amendments. Many of these are of a purely drafting character such as would normally be made in a Consolidation Bill. Others represent amendments of the law which, though for the most part of a drafting character, might be regarded as falling outside the scope of pure consolidation.7. The method by which, if our recommendations are adopted, legislative effect could most speedily and conveniently bo given to them is not strictly within our Terms of Reference, but it may none the less bo useful if we state shortly the conclusions to which we have been led by the actual handling of the large mass of material with which our Report deals. At the beginning of our inquiry we assumed (as indicated by Mr. Greenwood in the letter from himself to our Chairman, referred to in paragraph 3 above) that the normal procedure would bo adopted, that is to say, that a Bill embodying the necessary amendments of the existing law would be presented to Parliament, and that, if this Bill passed, the law as so amended would be consolidated in a subsequent Bill. This pro-cedure, which has been tested and found successful on several pre-vious occasions, has the advantage that the first Bill is limited to such provisions of the existing law as call for amendment, while the second Bill, being a purely consolidating measure, is referred to the Joint Committee of the two Houses of Parliament on Consoli-dation Bills and is not exposed to proposals for amendments of substance. Such a Bill thus occupies a minimum of parliamentary time and makes only an inconsiderable demand on the attention of Ministers.S. As our investigation of the various local government statutes progressed it became clear that if they were to be reduced to a single code and re-written in modern language, the actual number of amendments which, though largely of a drafting character, coidd not be regarded as pure consolidation would be very consider-able.   The chief reasons for this may be shortly explained.The large volume of amendments necessary to produce a single code is due not merely to the fact that the main types of local authorities county councils, borough councils, and urban and rural district councils are governed by different statutes, but also to the fact that these statutes differ widely in their language and are drafted on different principles. Thus the Public Health Act, 1875, imposes on urban and rural sanitary authorities definite powers and duties relating to public health, and the general provisions of that Act (that is, those conferring power to incur expenditure, acquire land, borrow money, employ staff and so forth) are strictly limited to the discharge of those powers and duties.   As a conse-
quence, in every subsequent statute conferring or imposing on urban and rural district councils fresh powers or duties (e.g., housing) fresh general provisions have had to be inserted, though this has usually, but by no means always, been done by reference to the Public Health Acts. On the other hand, the general powers con-ferred on municipal corporations by the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, cover the whole of the activities of the corporation as such acting through the council of the borough, but, broadly speak-ing, do not extend to the council when discharging statutory functions such as those relating to public health, housing and the like. The Local Government Act, 1888, the latest and in its language by far the most modern of the three codes, proceeds on yet a different principle, since its general provisions cover all the activities of a county council whether conferred by the Act itself or by subsequent statutes.. 9. There can be no doubt that the principle of the Act of 18S8 is the most convenient one, and subject to certain qualifications which will appear in our Report and the Notes on Clauses it is true to say that the draft Bill follows this precedent and provides a framework of general powers which will be available for local authorities in the exercise of any existing or future functions. We have, however, for two reasons found it impossible to apply this principle in every case. In the first place, to make applicable to all types of local authorities and to all the activities of local autho-rities provisions which at present, as in the case of the Public Health Act, 1S75, only apply to certain types (urban and rural sanitary authorities), and only to those types in connection with certain activities, would in some cases involve alterations of the law on matters of a controversial nature. Instances of this will appear later in our Report. Secondly, in dealing with the more important services Parliament has frequently enacted fresh general powers, or if, as in the case of education, the service has been transferred from other bodies to local authorities, has left outstanding the general powers originally provided for those bodies. The codes so enacted differ to a greater or less extent from those of 1875, 1882 and 1SSS. Thus the consolidating Education Act of 1921 provides a complete set of powers for the acquisition, appropriation and disposal of land notwithstanding that, so far as county councils were concerned, the powers of the Act of 1888 were already available.*The repeal of all these general powers embodied in the Education, Lunacy, Small Holdings, and other important statutes would involve the amendment of a great number of Acts quite outside those with which we are primarily concerned, and we have felt no doubt that this was beyond our Terms of Reference and that the gradual simplification of the law in this respect must be left to the future.* Section 6 (6) of the Mental Treatment Act, 1930, illustrates the diffi-culties arising from the conferment of overlapping powers.
Thus, as will be seen from the draft Bill, the application of a single code of general powers to existing functions has had to be made subject to numerous exceptions and qualifications.10. The foregoing considerations will indicate some of the reasons why the task of producing a single code has proved a much more difficult and complicated matter than we originally anticipated, and why the amendments which we suggest are so numerous.We have accordingly been forced to the conclusion that an amending Bill would in fact be little shorter than a Bill repealing the existing statutes and re-enacting them with amendments, and that its complexity would be attended with disadvantages altogether outweighing the advantages which can in ordinary cases be secured by resorting to the normal procedure mentioned in paragraph 7 of this Report. Hence, if it is decided to proceed with legislation on the lines of our recommendations, we believe that the more practicable course will be to invite Parliament to pass a single consolidating and amending Bill instead of following the procedure of separate amending and consolidating Bills. We appreciate that if this course is adopted Members of Parliament may fairly demand a full statement of the points on which amendments of substance are proposed, and our Report, including the Notes on Clauses, has been prepared with this object in view.We fully recognise that this procedure is an exceptional one, and we should certainly hesitate to recommend it were it not for the fact that the subject-matter of the draft Bill an amalgamation of three divergent codes is of an equally exceptional nature. We may add, as regards the public health law which forms the remainder of our task, that we do not anticipate that the same difficulty will arise, or that there will be the same justification for departing from the normal procedure.11. Mention may here be made of certain subjects which we have advisedly excluded from the draft Bill: (a) The following provisions have been omitted as inappropriate-priate to the present code (i) Parts VIII and IX of the Municipal Corporations Act, 18S2, dealing with Police and the Administration of Justice, and similar provisions in the Local Government Acts;(ii) provisions of the Act of 1882 dealing with the functions of municipal corporations as trustees of municipal charities and owners of advowsons, and those of the Local Government Act, 1894, dealing with parochial charities;(iii) provisions relating to highways and bridges ;(iv) rating enactments.
(6) The law relating to Exchequer Grants to local author-ities (including the whole of Part VI of the Local Government Act, 1929). has been omitted. The new system of grants created by that Act is still in its initial stages, and by the terms of the Act itself further legislation will be required to fix the amount of the General Exchequer Contribution for the second and subsequent fixed grant periods. In the circumstances it seems more convenient that this legislation, which forms a compact whole, should be left outstanding for the time being i(c) Part IV of the Municipal Corporations Act, 18S2, and the Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Acts, 1884 and 1911, which deal with election petitions and corrupt and illegal practices at municipal elections, have been omitted. Strictly speaking these enactments form part of the election code for borough and county councils (as regards district and parish councils they are applied by the Local Government Act, 1894, subject to adaptations, alterations and exceptions made by the Election Rules), but the occasions on which they come into play are happily rare and it appeared to us to be a mistake to encumber the Bill with some sixty or seventy additional Clauses of this nature. These enactments are accordingly omitted from the draft Bill. In this connection we desire to add that, while we consider it to be desirable, at any rate as a temporary measure, to collect in the Bill the scattered enactments relating to local government elections, we feel that hereafter considerations for the due arrangement of the Statute Book may require the removal of these provisions to a statute comprising the whole law relating to both Parlia-mentary and Local Government elections, viz., franchise, conduct of elections, and corrupt and illegal practices.(d) We have not attempted to deal with the various Super-annuation Acts relating to local government officers. Of these the principal general Acts are: The Local Government and other Officers&apos; Super-annuation Act, 1922 ;The Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1896 (which was in the main repealed by the Local Government Act, 1929, but still governs the superannuation rights of a number of officers);The Teachers (Superannuation) Acts, 1918 to 1928;The Asylum Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1909, and the Asylum and Certified Institutions (Officers Pensions) Act, 1918 ;The Fire Brigade Pensions Acts, 1925 and 1929.To attempt any assimilation of these codes would, even if in itself practicable or desirable, be far beyond the scope of our Terms of Reference, and although logically superannuation
inrights may be considered as forming a branch of the terms upon which local government officers are invited to serve, we feel no doubt that the subject is more conveniently dealt with in separate statutes.(e) We have not reproduced the provisions contained in the Local Government Acts dealing with special areas. How far these provisions are still effective is difficult to deter-mine without making local enquiries, and wo think that the better course is to leave these matters to be settled at a later stage between the Ministry of Health and the local authorities concerned.12. Mention should also be made of the course which we have adopted in reproducing the numerous powers of making rules, regulations and orders contained in the existing statutes. In one respect we have extended these powers, namely by providing in a number of cases that the form of a document, e.g., a mortgage, is to be prescribed instead of scheduling it to the BUI. This has effected a substantial shortening of the Bill and is in accord with modern practice.. In a few other cases, to which attention is called in the Notes on Clauses, we have slightly amplified or re-restricted a rule-making power. In the matter of procedure for making regulations and orders, and for laying them before Parliament, the widest variety of language is to be found in the existing statutes, and in other circumstances we should have felt it necessary to attempt some assimilation. But the whole of this subject is exhaustively examined in the Report (Cmd. 4060/1932) of the Departmental Committee on Ministers&apos; Powers. That being so, we have thought it better to reproduce the existing law, contenting ourselves with substituting in some cases &quot; regulations&quot; for &quot; orders &quot; in accordance with the terminology suggested by that Committee, and providing a uniform period for the laying of rules and regulations before Parliament.13. We are fully conscious that in an investigation into a subject of this complexity, involving an examination of legislation extending over a century or more, mistakes will have been made, some of which will no doubt be brought to light if this Report and the accompany-ing draft Bill are published. Moreover, we axe reminded by those responsible for the drafting of the Clauses that this work has had to be undertaken in the midst of heavy pressure of other and more urgent duties.14. We proceed to deal with the points arising on the various Parts of the draft Bill to which we consider special attention ought to be drawn, leaving those of minor importance to be raised in the Notes on Clauses.
PART I.CONSTITUTION AND ELECTIONS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.Borouglis and Urban Districts. 15. By virtue of Sections 21 and 39 of the Local Government Act, 1894, the expression &quot;urban district&quot; includes not only the areas usually known by that name but also non-county boroughs, and the expression &quot; district council&quot; includes the council of a non-county borough. For some purposes the expressions also include a county borough and the council of a county borough  see Kirkdalc Burial Board v. Liverpool Corporation (1904) 1 Ch. 829. These provisions have given rise in the past to a good deal of con-fusion, and as there appears to be no sufficient reason for continuing to use a single expression as including two or more separate and distinct types of area, tho draft Bill has been prepared so as to distinguish in the future between boroughs and other urban districts. A similar distinction is drawn in the draft Bill between the councils of boroughs and urban district councils. These changes are merely matters of terminology, and will not affect the actual name or the powers and duties of the bodies concerned.The expression &quot; county district &quot; is used in the draft Bill to include non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural districts, .and thus has the same meaning as under the existing law.Vestries.16. The position of vestries calls for detailed consideration. The parish was the original unit of local government, the parochial organisation, for both civil and ecclesiastical purposes, being the vestry, which was either open or select. The Local Government Act, 1894, however, transferred the civil functions of vestries in rural parishes either to the parish council or to the parish meeting of the parish. Thus, so far as rural parishes are concerned, civil functions ceased to be exercisable by vestries nearly forty years ago.As regards urban parishes in Wales and Monmouthshire, Section 25 (1) of the Welsh Church Act, 1914, transferred the civil functions of the vestries of those parishes (including the functions which, in rural parishes, had been transferred to the parish meeting) to the council of the borough or urban district in which the parish was situate, and accordingly all vestries in Wales and Monmouth-shire have been deprived of civil powers.As regards urban parishes in England (other than Monmouth-shire), no such general transfer has been made, but Section 33 of the Local Government Act, 1894, enabled the Local Government Board (now the Minister of Health) by order to confer on the council of a borough or urban district who applied for an order any powers, duties or liabilities of a parish council.   Many orders have been
112made under this section conferring on borough and urban district councils some or all of the powers of the vestry which, in a rural parish, had passed to the parish council. Moreover, in some boroughs and urban districts the civil powers of the vestry have been trans-ferred to the council by local Acts.17. It is believed that the only civil functions of vestries still generally existing in urban parishes are as follows: (a) The power of adopting the Burial Acts, 1852 to 1906, of appointing a burial board, and of controlling certain expenses of the burial board under those Acts;(b) Where the Burial Acts have not been adopted for an urban parish, the power of directing, under Section 42 of the Burial Act, 1852, the provision of a mortuary for the parish :(c) In a parish with a population of over 2,000, the power of consenting to the provision of a vestry room and to the raising of a loan for that purpose (Vestries Act, 1850) ;(d) In a parish with a population of over 4,000, the power of consenting to the provision of a parochial office or of a depository for parish documents (Parochial Offices Act, 1861);(e) The power of giving directions as to the custody of parish documents (Vestries Act, 1818) ;(/) The right to have laid before them accounts of all parochial charities (Charitable Trusts Amendment Act, 1855), and to appoint trustees or beneficiaries of charities where the power of appointment is conferred on the vestry by the trust deed.IS. In our opinion the time has now come when the whole of the civil powers of vestries in urban areas in England should be transferred to the council of the borough or urban district as was done in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1914. We accordingly recommend that such a transfer should be made, and have inserted a clause in the draft Bill (Clause 264) for that purpose.If our recommendation on this point is adopted vestries will remain for ecclesiastical purposes only, of which, however, few remain, the bulk of them having been transferred to parochial church councils and meetings by the Parochial Church Councils-lowers) Measure, 1921.Procedure for Election.19. The procedure for the election of borough and county councillors is governed by the Municipal Corporations Act, 1S82, and the Local Government Act, 1SS8. In the case of district and parish councils the procedure is for the most part left to rules to-be made by the Secretary of State u^der Section 4S of the Local Government Act, 1894. In our view, the distinction in this respect between county and borough councils on the one hand, and district
councils on the other, cannot, in principle, be justified, and an assimilation of the law which, while leaving matters of substance to the statute, provided that details of election procedure should in the case of all authorities be governed by Rules, would considerably shorten and simplify the draft Bill. We think, however, that such a change, involving a substantial extension of regulation-making powers and replacing, as regards county and borough councils, statutory rights and requirements by rights and requirements depending on rules not made directty by Parliament, would not be wholly uncontroversial, and in the circumstances we have thought it right, subject to certain points to which attention is drawn in the Notes on Clasues, to reproduce the existing law.Adjudication on Nominations.20. By the Third Schedule to the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, the mayor, at an election of borough councillors, is required to attend at the town hall on the day following the last day for delivery of nomination papers for a sufficient time between the hours of two and four in the afternoon, to decide on the validity of any objection made in writing to a nomination paper, and any candidate or his agent may attend at the appointed time for the purpose of making an objection to the nomination paper of anjr other candidate. The decision of the mayor must be given in writing, and if disallowing an objection is final, but is otherwise subject to reversal on an Election Petition. These provisions apply also in the case of an election of a county councillor, the adjudication being made by the returning officer.21. It has been held on more than one occasion by the High Court that the jurisdiction of the mayor or the returning officer, as the case may be, is limited to objections made by or on behalf of a candidate and arising on the face of the nomination paper, e.g., that it is not in the statutory form, or that the nomi-nators are not registered as local government electors (see, for example, Pritcliard v. Mayor ofBangor (1888) 13 A.C. 241; Howes v. Turner, 1876, 1 C.P.D. 670 ; Monks v. Jackson (1876) 1 C.P.D. 683). The mayor or returning officer has no jurisdiction to decide whether the candidate is qualified for election, or whether the nomination paper was delivered in due time. Moreover it is open to doubt whether he can reject a nomination paper which is obviously bad on the face of it, if no objection thereto is taken in writing before him. These matters can apparently be decided only on an Election Petition.22. A different procedure has been in force since 1894 in the case of elections of urban and rural district councillors. Under the Election Rules governing these elections the returning officer is required, as soon as practicable after receipt of nominations, to examine all the nomination papers for the purpose of deciding whether they
have been properly filled up and signed by registered electors, and whether they were presented in duo time. He must then give public notice of his decision on each nomination paper, and also give notice of his decision to each candidate. Further, candidates are allowed to withdraw their candidatures after the decision on the validity of the nomination papers has been given.23. We appreciate that to assimilate the procedure applicable to county and borough councils to that under the more modern eode of the Election Rules involves abolishing the personal hearing of objections, and that this would be a considerable change in the election law. We are satisfied, however, both from the personal experience of some of our members and from the discussion which we had with representatives of the Association of Municipal Corpor-ations who attended one of our meetings, that the procedure of a personal hearing is seldom anything more than a matter of form, and that the appearance of an objector is a very rare occurrence. We understand indeed that the precise extent of the obligation of the mayor or returning officer to attend at the town hall or other place for the purpose has been differently interpreted in different areas. In view of these facts, and of the objections to the older procedure to which attention has been called above, we consider that the procedure applicable to district council elections is to be preferred and we have accordingly provided in the draft Bill for the extension of that procedure to elections of county and borough -councillors.Time-Table for Elections. 24. The present time-table for the election of county and borough councillors is as follows : (a) Notice of election At least nine days before the day of election. (6) Latest day for nominations Seven days before the day of election, before 5 p.m.(c) Latest day for withdrawals Next day, before 2 p.m.(d) Decision as to validity of nominations Same day, between 2 and 4 p.m.(e) Notice of poll At least four days before the day of election.It will be observed that the period for the election as a whole, nine days, is a minimum which can, if necessary, be extended by an earlier publication of the notice of election, but that the latest date for nominations, seven days before the day of election, is a fixed date which there is no power to alter.25. It has been represented to us that these periods are far too short in the case of county council elections, and we are satisfied that, having regard to the geographical conditions in many counties,
longer periods are required in the interests alike of the electors, the candidates, and the officials conducting the election.The same considerations do not apply to borough council elections, but even in these cases it appears to us that slightly longer periods for the delivery of nomination papers and for the withdrawal of candidatures are desirable.26. We accordingly recommend that the time-table for elections of county councillors and borough councillors, based on the assump-tion that other recommendations made in this Report are accepted, should be as follows : Notice of Election County Councillors. Not later than the twentieth day before the day of election.Borough Councillors. Not later than the twelfth day before the day of election.Delivery of Nomination Papers County Councillors. Not later than 5 p.m. on the twelfth day before the day of election.Borough Councillors. Not later than 5 p.m. on the eighth day before tho day of election. Despatch of notices of decision on nomination papers, and publication of statement of persons nominated County Councillors. Not later than 5 p.m. on the eleventh day before the day of election.Borough Councillors. Not later than 5 p.m. on the seventh day before the day of election.Delivery of Notices of Withdrawals from Candidature County Councillors. Not later than 5 p.m. on the ninth day before the day of election.Borough Councillors. Not later than 5 p.ni. on the sixth day before the day of election.Notice of Poll-County and Borough Councillors. Not later than the fifth day before the day of election.Under this proposed time-table the ordinary periods for the elections would be, excluding Sundays and pubMc holidays, twenty-one days in the case of county council elections and thirteen days in the case of borough council elections.Elections of Parish Councillors.27. The attention of the Royal Commission on Local Government was drawn to the fact that the procedure for electing parish coun-cillors by show of hands at a parish meeting is in many respects
114unsatisfactory, and the Commission made a number of recom-mendations (Final Report, paragraphs 323-326) for altering the system, and in particular in the case of the larger and more populous parishes. We reached the conclusion that it would be beyond our Terms of Reference to embody these recommendations in the draft Bill.Use of Schoolrooms by Candidates at Elections.28. Under Section 4 of the Local Government Act, 1894, a candidate for election as a rural district councillor or parish coun-eillor may use a schoolroom for the purpose of his candidature, provided that he bears any expense incurred by the persons having control over the room, and makes good any damage done to the room or to the furniture and fittings therein, and provided that there is no interference with school hours. There is, however, no similar provision as regards candidates at other local government elections.As regards parliamentary elections, by Section 25 of the Re-presentation of the People Act, 1918, a candidate in either an urban or a rural area is entitled to the use of a schoolroom for the purposes of his candidature, and is required to bear the cost and to make good any damage, as under the Act of 1S94.29. The County Councils Association invited us to consider the question of affording to candidates at county council elections similar facilities for the use of public elementary schools. We understand that the Home Office have informed the Association that they would raise no objection to this proposal, and that the Board of Education have taken the same view but have suggested that the proposal should be confined to schools in rural parishes.30. As regards rural areas, there appears to be no good reason for making any distinction between elections of county councillors on the one hand and elections of rural district councillors and parish councillors on the other; and as the Legislature has already admitted the principle of allowing schoolrooms to be used free of charge by the candidates at the latter elections, we recommend that the same facilities shall be allowed to candidates at county council elections, and have provided accordingly in the draft Bill (Clause 69). In urban areas, however, we understand that no difficulty usually arises in candidates obtaining a suitable room, and we are not satisfied that there is any case for extending the same facilities to those areas.Frivolous Candidatures.31. Our attention has been drawn both by the Home Office and by the Association of Municipal Corporations to an abuse of the electoral procedure in counties and boroughs which occurs
not infrequently owing to the absence of any restriction on the number of electoral areas for which a candidate may be nominated. A single example will suffice.    At a recent election in a borough, one candidate contested eight of the nine wards into which the borough is divided.   There would have been no contest in any of these wards but for his candidature.   He polled 214 votes in the aggregate in the eight wards.   The same person has stood annually for election in one or more wards since 1925, forcing three contests in 1926, and one each in 1928, 1929 and 1930.  Further, in 1928 he forced contests in three electoral divisions for the election of county councillors ; and in 1931 he stood for five electoral divisions, forcing a contest in four of them.   The total costs to the ratepayers of the contests forced by this one person amount to more than  1,000.32. There appear to be two possible methods by which frivolous candidatures coidd be restricted, namely (i) by a system of deposits as in Parliamentary elections, or (ii) by restricting the number of electoral areas for which a candidate may be nominated, or in which he may stand for election.The difficulty of fixing a deposit at a figure which would not prevent bona fide candidates from offering themselves for election, but would at the same time successfully deter frivolous candidates, appears to be too great to render the first alternative practicable. The second method, which consists in restricting the number of electoral areas for which a candidate may be nominated or in which he may stand for election, whilst not wholly preventing frivolous candida-tures would, in our view, probably reduce the mischief to a very large extent. If this plan is adopted, the question remains whether nomination in more than one electoral area should be prohibited, or whether a candidate should be allowed to be nominated for more than one electoral area but to stand for election in one area only. The latter alternative would involve the least alteration of the existing law necessary to attain the desired object, and would appear to be more in accord with the principle which allows candidates to withdraw after nomination.33. &quot;We have accordingly provided in the draft Bill that whilst no restriction is to be placed upon the number of electoral areas for which a candidate may be nominated, he shall not be allowed to go to election in more than one electoral division of a county, or in more than one ward of a borough, and that if he does not withdraw his candidature in the remaining electoral divisions or wards by the latest time for withdrawal of candidatures, the county retiu-ning officer at a county council election, and the mayor at an election of borough councillors, shall determine for which electoral division or ward the candidate is to stand for election. This provision will also apply to elections of district and parish councillors, subject to any adaptations, alterations or exceptions made by the Election Rules.
PART II.GENERAL PROVISIONS AS TO MEMBERS AND MEETINGS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND ELECTIONS.Obligation to accept Office.34. Under the existing law a person may be nominated for, and elected to, a municipal office in a borough without his consent, and in general ho must, if elected and duly qualified, either serve or pay a fine for non-acceptance of office. There are, however, several exceptions to this rule scattered over the Statute Book and the following persons are either ineligible for election or, if elected, are not liable to serve, viz.: (a) persons of unsound mind, or disabled by deafness, blindness or other permanent mfirmity ;(jb) persons over the age of Co who, within the preceding five years, have either served in the office or paid the fine for non-acceptance of office, and claim exemption within five days after election;(c) officers of the Navy, Army, Marines, or Air Force on full pay or half pay ;(d) members of the Army and Air Force Reserves ;(e) persons employed and residing in His Majesty&apos;s dock-yards, victualling establishments, arsenals, barracks, and other naval, military or air force establishments;(/) officers of Customs and Excise;(g) the Commissioners of Inland Revenue and their officers ; (7t) the Postmaster-General and officers of the Post Office ; (i) factory inspectors;(j) superintendent registrars, registrars of births and deaths, and registrars of marriages ;(jfe) registered medical practitioners ;(/.) registered dentists.35. In the case of county and district councils, a person is not liable to a fine for non-acceptance of office, if he was nominated with-out his consent.36. In our opinion there is no ground for maintaining these distinctions between borough councillors on the one hand and county and district councillors on the other, and we consider that a proce-dure under which a person may be nominated to serve in a public office against his wishes is obsolete. Moreover, the penalty for non-acceptance of a municipal office can be rendered nugatory by any borough council which thinks fit to fix a nominal penalty, and we understand that in practice the amounts of the penalties
fixed vary from several pounds to a few shillings. The draft Bill accordingly omits all references to penalties and provides that a person shall not be nominated for election as a councillor, unless he has consented to be nominated. The consent is to be given in writing within one month before the last day for delivery of nomina-tion papers, attested by one witness, and delivered not later than the last day for the receipt of nomination papers.37. Logically, a similar provision should be applied to elections for the offices of chairman of a county council, mayor, and county or borough alderman. We understand, however, that no practical difficulty arises in these cases, since the nominations are made at a meeting of the council at which the candidates are usually present, and we think that an amendment of the law requiring consent to nomination in these cases is unnecessary.Resignation.38. A member of a county or borough council may resign his office at any time by notice in writing addressed to the clerk of the county council or to the town clerk, as the case may be, and on payment of the fine provided for non-acceptance of office. This provision was extended by the Local Government Act, 1894, to members of urban district councils, subject to any adaptations, alterations or exceptions made by the Election Rules. A rural district councillor, however, can only resign his office for reasons approved by the Minister of Health. No fine is payable in such a case. A member of a parish council may resign his office at any time by writing addressed to the council, and without the payment of a fine.39. It appears to us that any reason which may have existed in 1S94 for differentiating in this matter between rural district council-lors on the one hand and county, borough and urban district councillors on the other no longer holds good, and we understand that the duty of determining whether or not a rural district councillor has good reasons for resigning is regarded by the Ministry of Health as an embarrassing one. There is a clear case for applying identical provisions to all classes of councils, and as, in our view, unwilling service in a public office is of no real value to the community, the Bill provides that a member of a local authority may resign his office at any time without payment of a fine.Casual Vacancies.40. Section 66 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1S82, provides that a casual vacancy occurring among the members of a borough council is to be filled &quot; within fourteen days after notice in writing of the vacancy has been given to the mayor or town clerk &quot; by two
116local government electors. This provision applies also in the case of county councils, but in the case of county councillors a casual vacancy which occurs within six months before the ordinary day of retirement of county councillors is not to be filled.In the case of district councillors the Election Rules provide that the vacancy is to be filled &quot; within one month after notice in writing of the vacancy has been given by two councillors,&quot; but, as in the case of county councillors, a vacancy occurring within six months before the ordinary day of retirement from the office in winch the vacancy occurs is not to be filled.41. County councils ordinarily meet at quarterly intervals, and borough councils at monthly intervals. In these circum-stances it is sometimes necessary to call a special meeting of the council for the sole purpose of filling a vacancy in the office of chairman of a county council or county alderman, or in the office of mayor or alderman of a borough. In order to avoid the expense of calling a special meeting for this purpose, the draft Bill provides that an election to fill a vacancy in any of these offices, or in the office of chairman of a district council, shall be held &quot; not later than the next ordinary meeting of the council,&quot; or if that meeting is held within fourteen days after the date on which the vacancy occurs then &quot; not later than the next following ordinary meeting of the council.&quot;42. With regard to vacancies in the office of councillors, it will be necessary to extend the period of fourteen days referred to in Section 66 of the Act of 1SS2 if the recommendation contained in paragraph 26 of this Report is adopted, and we recommend that the period shoidd be extended to thirty days. In those cases in which a declaration of the council is required to create a vacancy, the period of thirty days should run from the date of the declaration. In other cases the period should run, as at present, from the date on which notice of the vacancy is given by two local government electors.43. We further recommend that the provisions applicable to borough councillors should be assimilated to those applicable to county and district councillors by providing that a casual vacancy occurring within six months of the day on which the councillor in question would ordinarily have retired shall not be filled until the ordinary day of election, and shall then be filled as an ordinary vacancy, the person elected having the usual term of office. Follow-ing the precedent, however, of Section 1 (2) (6) of the Audit (Local Authorities) Act, 1927, the draft Bill provides an exception to this Rule to meet the case where the number of persons disqualified at any one time exceeds one-third of the whole number of members of the council.
Disqualifications arising out of Interest in Contracts.44. This subject presents unusual difficulties, partly because of the discrepancies between the two codes applying to county and borough councils on the one hand and to district and parish councils on the other, and partly because experience has shown that neither code is altogether satisfactory.The enactment applicable to borough councils is Section 12 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882. This disqualifies a person for being elected and for being a member of a borough council if he has &quot; directly or indirectly, by himself or his partner, any share or interest in any contract or employment with, by, or on behalf of the council.&quot; The section then sets out a number of exceptions to the general rule. The Local Government Act, 1888, applied these provisions to county councils, but by Section 5 of the High-ways and Bridges Act, 1891, the exceptions were further extended, in the case of members of county councils, to contracts for the supply from land of stone, gravel, or other materials for making or repairing highways or bridges, provided that the share or interest -of the member in such contract does not exceed fifty pounds in any one year.By Section 22 (3) of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, a member of a borough council is not entitled to vote or take part in the discussion of any matter before the council, or a committee thereof, in which he has directly or indirectly, by himself or his partner, any pecuniary interest. This provision also applies to county councils by virtue of the Local Government Act, 1888.45. The enactment applicable to district and parish councils is Section 46 (1) (e) of the Local Government Act, 1894. The general effect of this provision is the same as that of Section 12 of the Act of 1882, but there are a number of differences of language, and in particular contracts for the supply of stone, gravel, etc., are excluded (following the principle of the Highways and Bridges Act, 1S91, but without the fifty pounds limit imposed by that Act), and in the case of parish councillors a disqualification which would otherwise arise under the section may be removed by the county council, if they are of opinion that the removal would be of benefit to the parish.46. In addition to the exceptions referred to above the following further exceptions apply to members of all local authorities : (a) renting a house provided by the local authority under Part III of the Housing Act, 1925 ;,.(b) assistance by way of grant or loan under the Housing (Rural Workers) Acts, 1926 and 1931 :(c) loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, 1899 to 1923;(d) fees payable to medical practitioners under the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889.
11?47. The Royal Commission on Local Government considered the above provisions with particular regard to the decision of the-House of Lords in the case of Lapish v. Brailhwaite (1926) A.C. 275, a case in which it was held that an alderman who was a shareholder-and managing director (paid by salary and not by commission) of a company holding contracts with the corporation was not disqualified under Section 12 of the Act of 1882. The Com-missioners were satisfied that an amendment of the existing law was required, and recommended that: (a) the general principles of any such amendment of the law should be : &quot; (i) to make it uniform for all classes of authorities &quot; and  committees  thereof;&quot; (ii) to bring it up to date so as to suit modern con-&quot; ditions ;&quot; (iii) to make it clear, so far as it is possible to define &quot; the disqualifications without making the code so ex-&quot; elusive so as to debar any substantial part of the popula-&quot; tion from taking part in local government &quot; ; (6) the disqualification should apply to voting rather than to membership, and the provisions of Section 22 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1S82, &quot; should be extended to cover, without exceptions, shareholders, directors and em-ployees of companies with which the local authority may contract; and should be applied to members of all classes of local authorities &quot; ;(c) as regards medical practitioners, &quot; a doctor who is remunerated by fees for specific services rendered under certain Acts need not be disqualified for membership of a local author-ity,&quot; but that, on the other hand, &quot; a doctor who is rendering not necessarily continuous but continuing service in a specified capacity, such as a medical officer at a maternity and child welfare centre, is more clearly in a contractual relation with the local authority, and should therefore be disqualified from membership.&quot;   (Final Report, paragraphs 33S to 341.) 48. There is an unanswerable case for having in this matter a. single code applicable to all types of local authorities, but the-question whether the code should, as under the existing law, pro-vide for disqualification for membership, or, following the recom-mendations of the Royal Commission, merely disqualify for voting, raises large issues of policy.   Without traversing again the field covered by the Report of the Royal Commission we may point out some of the practical difficulties in the way of maintaining the principle of the existing codes.   The complicated provisions of the present law represent attempts on the part of the Legislature to-arrive at a formula for distinguishing between cases in which a real conflict of interest and duty is likely to arise if the person
interested in the contract acts as a member of a council, and those in which his personal interest in the matter is scarcely more than nominal. The distinction is sometimes drawn in terms of the subject-matter of the contract, e.g., contracts for the supply of stone, for lighting or water, or a contract for a loan to the council; sometimes by reference to the nature of the person&apos;s interest in the proposed contract, i.e., the fact that he is merely a shareholder in a joint stock company ; and in one case in terms of a monetary limit. In one instance a higher authority, the county council, is given a dispensing power. The case of Lavish v. Braithwaite and many other reported decisions go to show that these codes have proved by no means self-explanatory or, even apart from ambiguities, satisfactory. In particular, the growth of the &quot; one-man company &quot; has made the fact that the person is connected with the contract merely as a shareholder a quite illusory test of the degree of his interest in the matter.It would be possible to distinguish, as has been done in recent legislation, between a person who is a mere shareholder and one who as a shareholder has a controlling interest in the company. But this is by no means a complete solution of the problem. A person may obviously have a very large stake in a limited company without having a controlling interest. Similarly, a monetary criterion breaks down in practice whether the Umit fixed be fifty pounds or any other sum. The circumstances of individual members of local authorities are too varied to permit of this being a satis-factory test of the existence or non-existence of a real conflict of interest and duty.If, as suggested by the Royal Commission, the disqualification for membership is abolished and a disqualification for voting substituted, the difficulties indicated above disappear, since it is not unreasonable to subject every person, however nominal his interest may be, to the temporary restriction of being debarred from voting, provided that care is taken that the disqualification is not likely to be so widespread as to render the council incapable of effective action.49. After much consideration we have come to the conclusion * that, in view of the difficulties which we have touched on above and which are inherent in the existing law, we should best serve the purpose for which we were appointed by framing a clause on the general lines recommended by the Royal Commission. This has been done, and the Clause appears as Clause 76 of the draft Bill. We draw attention to the following points (1) It has seemed to us important that there should be some* Mr. Staddon cannot entirely concur in this conclusion, feeling that a contract disqualification should (with convenient exceptions) continue, together with a prohibition from voting, etc., on matters of personal interest.
118safeguards in addition to that of a mere prohibition from voting. The clause accordingly provides (a) that the member in question is not to take part in the consideration or discussion of the matter ; and(6) following the principle adopted in Section 149 of tho Companies Act, 1929, with regard to directors of limited companies, that the member, if present at a meeting, is to be under an obligation to disclose the fact that ho is interested in a contract or other matter which is under consideration at that meeting ;   and(c) that the local authority may by standing orders provide for the exclusion of a member from a meeting whilst the contract or other matter in which he has a pecuniary interest is under discussion.(2) The clause is drawn so as to include not merely &quot; contracts &quot; but &quot; matters.&quot; This follows the principle of Section 22 (3) of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882. Questions have arisen whether financial assistance towards the building or repair of houses given under the terms of various Housing Acts has involved the existence of a contract between the local authority and the recipient of the grant. It is clearly absurd that a person who applied for a grant should find himself in a more favourable position in this respect than one who tendered for a contract, and the use of the wider word &quot; matter &quot; would avoid this difficulty.(3) Provision is made, as in Section 149 of the Companies Act, 1929, for a member giving a general notice of his interest in any particular firm or company, and for the clerk keeping a record, which is to be open to inspection by any member of the council, of these notices and of any disclosures made at a meeting.(4) Provision has been made to cover cases in which the interest of the member is plainly of so nominal a kind that disqualification even from taking part in the discussion would be absurd, and to avoid the danger of a local authority finding itself unable to act effectively owing to a large proportion of its members becoming unable to discuss or vote on a question.(5) It has not been thought necessary to make any special refer-enoe to the position of medical practitioners. Those who hold office under a local authority, or who contract to render continuing service, e.g., a consultant at a public health institution, would normally be disqualified under the general provision which disqualifies paid officers or persons holding places of profit under the local authority from being members of the local authority. Doctors who receive fees under the provisions of the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, or the Midwives Act, 1918, would not, we think, fall into this category, and would accordingly, if our recommendations are adopted, merely fall under the prohibition against taking part in the discussion in the somewhat rare event of the question of
fees under those Acts being the subject of discussion. The case of doctors who receive fees for attending school children is more difficult, as these fees are not paid under statute but are matters of contract between the local education authority and the doctor. Cases of this type and others in which arrangements are made between local authorities and doctors for medical services of a com-paratively trifling kind, will turn on the question whether in the particular case the arrangements are such as to make the doctor a paid officer or a person holding a place of profit in the gift or disposal of the authority.Penalties for acting when Disqualified and Method, of enforcingPenalties.50. Under Section 41 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1S82. a person who acts in a corporate office after ceasing to be qualified or becoming disqualified is liable to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, recoverable by action. This provision is extended to county councils by Section 75 of the Local Government Act, 1888. In the case of district and parish councils, Section 40 (8) of the Local Government Act, 1894, provides for a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, recover-able summarily.51. Under Section 73 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1S82, a municipal election not called in question within twelve months either by an election petition or by information in the nature of quo warranto is deemed to be valid. By Section 87 of the same Act elections may be questioned by election petition on various grounds stated in the section, including the ground that at the date of the election the person was disqualified. The section provides that -an election is not to be questioned on any of these grounds except by an election petition. Section 225 of the Act lays down the procedure for informations in the nature of quo warranto. The power to lay an information in these cases is derived from Section 4 of the Municipal Offices Act, 1710, and Section 5 of that Act enables the Court to give judgment of ouster and to impose a fine. By Section 15 of the Judicature Act, 1884, proceedings by way of quo warranto were made civil proceedings, and in view of this provision it is doubtful whether since that date a fine could be imposed (see Short and Mellor&apos;s Crown Office Practice, p. 182).52. The position under Section 46 of the Local Government Act, 1894, in this matter is discussed at length in the judgment of McCardie J. in Everett v. GriffitJis (1924) 1 K.B. 941. In that case the plaintiff brought an action against the defendant, who was chairman of a Board of Guardians, seeking a declaration that he was disqualified under Section 46 (1) (e) of the Act of 1894 and claiming penalties. The action failed on both heads, it being held that as regards disqualification the proper remedy was by way of information in the nature of quo warranto, and as regards penalties
119by summary proceedings under Section 40 (8). In the case of district councils, as formerly in that of guardians, the proceedings are based on the common law and not on the Municipal Offices Act, 1710, and are governed by the Crown Office Rules, to which attention is called in the judgment. It appears that proceedings against members of county councils are also based on the common law, since the Act of 1710 has no application to county offices ; but that as Section 225 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, is applied to county councils by the Local Government Act, 1888, the pro-eedure is governed by that section and not by the Crown Office Rules. For practical purposes the differences between the section and the Rules arc slight, both providing the safeguards against vexatious proceedings to which McCardie J. draws attention.53. We arc satisfied (a) that there is no justification for retaining the two separate codes ;(6) that the procedure of the Local Government Act, 1894, under which separate proceedings must be taken in different courts to secure (i) the eviction from office of the defendant, and (ii) the imposition of a penalty, is unsatisfactory; and(c) that the antiquated procedure of information in the nature of quo warranto might with advantage be replaced by a simple action, provided that the safeguards against vexatious litigation are retained.54. The question of the Court in which proceedings should be taken presents some difficulty. The Act of 1S94 provided for summary proceedings, and to follow this precedent presents obvious advantages in the saving of time and expense. On the other hand, in summary proceedings the jurisdiction of the Court must be limited to the imposition of penalties, and cases *of importance may well arise in which it is desirable that there should be a power  roughly corresponding to the old judgment of ouster under which the Court may declare that the defendant is disqualified and that his seat is vacated, and, if necessary, prohibit him by injunction from acting. Moreover, as a perusal of the case law under Section 12 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, and Section 46 of the Local Government Act, 1S94, will show, the issues in cases of this land are not infrequently so difficult that there are substantial advantages in the matter being dealt with by the Higb Court in the first instance and not by way of Case Stated.55. These considerations have led us to the conclusion that where it is alleged that a person has acted when disqualified, a local government elector for the area should have the alternative remedy of proceeding either summarily for penalties, or in the High Court for a declaration, injunction and penalties; but that if he adopts the former alternative the court of summary jurisdiction
should be empowered to decline to deal with the case on the ground that the matter is more appropriate to proceedings in the High Court. A similar power is conferred on courts of summary jurisdic-tion by Section 10 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Married Women) Act, 1895, in connection with applications for separation and maintenance orders, and by some other statutes. We recommend also that the person against whom an information has been laid should be entitled to apply to the High Court on the ground that the matter could be more properly dealt with in that Court, and that the High Court should be empowered to direct the court of summary jurisdiction to dismiss the information on that ground.We appreciate that a procedure under which penalties can be imposed in civil proceedings before the High Court is exceptional, but the procedure has been in existence since 1875 under Section 107 of the Public Health Act of that year.Under the provisions of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts the time for taking summary proceedings is limited to six months, and we think that a similar time limit should be inserted in the case of proceedings in the High Court.56. We propose further that a local government elector should have the right to take proceedings in the High Court, but not summarily, against a person who claims to be entitled to act when disqualified. In this case there will be no question of imposing a penalty, but the Court will be empowered to grant relief by way of declaration and injunction. Proceedings under this head will no doubt be rare, but the corresponding jurisdiction under the Municipal Offices Act, 1710, and Section 225 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, extends to persons claiming to act, and it may occasionally be useful in order to enable the matter to be brought to the test of legal proceedings before the person making the claim has done any specific act. It will also enable an authoritative decision to be obtained by means of friendly proceedings in the case of a member whose qualification is doubtful.57. A provision on these lines has accordingly been inserted in the draft Bill (Clause 84). It is limited to cases in which the alleged dis-qualification arises after the date of the member&apos;s election. Any disqualification existing at the date of election should be dealt with by way of an election petition under the existing law.Meetings and Proceedings.58. The draft Bill reproduces the existing law on the subject of meetings and proceedings of local authorities with a few minor alterations to which attention is called in the Notes on Clauses.59. One point may, however, here be mentioned. Under para-graph 7 of Part I of the First Schedule to the Local Government Act, 1894, a single local government elector may demand a poll in respect of a resolution passed at a parish meeting and dealing with any of
the matters specified in sub-paragraphs (a) to (k) of the paragraph, but in other matters a poll is only required to be taken if the chair-man of the meeting assents or it is demanded by not less than five, or one-third, whichever is the less, of the electors present at the meeting. It appears to us very difficult to justify a provision under which a single elector can put the parish to the expense of a poll, and accordingly in reproducing this provision we have altered it so as to require the assent of the chairman, or a demand by five, or one-third, whichever is the less, of the members present, in every case. This provision will not affect the existing law as regards elections of parish councillors.PART III.COMMITTEES AND JOINT COMMITTEES. Appointment of Committees. 60. Under Section 22 of the Municipal Corpoi-ations Act, 1882, a borough council have power to appoint a committee for any purpose which in the opinion of the council would be better regulated and managed by means of a committee. Membership of the committee is confined to members of the council, and the committee must submit their acts to the council for approval. No provision is made in the section for the term of office of members of committees.Section 22 of the Act of 1S82 is applied to county councils by Section 75 of the Local Government Act, 18SS, and by Section 82 of that Act a county council is empowered to make regulations with respect to the quorum and proceedings of a committee, and the area within which it is to exercise its authority. A further and more important variation of the Act of 1S82 is the provision (Section S2 (2) of the Act of 188S) that a committee is to report/its proceedings to the council, but that to such extent as the council may direct the acts of the committee need not be submitted to the council for approval. Section 28 (2) and (3) of the Act of 18SS contain a further power under which a county council may delegate any of the powers and duties &quot; transferred to them by or in pursuance of this Act,&quot; except the power of raising money by rate or loan, either to a committee of the council or to a district council.61. Under Section 56 of the Local Government Act, 1S94, a district council or parish council may appoint a committee, consisting wholly or partly of members of the council, for the exercise of any powers which in the opinion of the council can properly be exercised by a committee. A committee so appointed ceases to hold office at the next annual meeting of the council. The acts of the com-mittee must be submitted to the council for approval, except in the case of a committee appointed by a district council for any of the purposes of the Public Health or Highway Acts. In that case the council may authorise the committee to do any act which
the council might do, except the raising of loans and the making of rates or contracts. Under Part rV of the First Schedule to the Act the council may make regulations with regard to the quorum, proceedings, etc., of committees.62. Apart from the provisions referred to in tho preceding paragraphs there are a large number of statutes which either require or enable local authorities to appoint committees for the purposes of those. Acts. These provisions are by no means uniform. In most cases persons who are not members of the local authority may, and in some cases must, be appointed as members of the com-mittce, but the proportion of members to non-members varies. Ex-ccpt, however, in the case of Sea Fisheries Committees, at least a majority of the members of every committee must be members of the appointing local authority.In some cases, e.g., under Section 7 of tho Mental Treatment Act, 1930, executive functions are delegated by the statute itself to a committee of tho council. The more usual form, however, is for the statute to provide that all matters other than those of an urgent land must be referred to and considered by the committee before the council proceed to take action, and that the council may delegate to the committee executive powers with or without restrictions or conditions. From the functions which may be delegated there are excepted in all cases the powers of rating and borrowing, and in addition, in the case of the Public Health Commit-tee or Highway Committee of a sanitary authority the power of entering into contracts, in the case of the Public Health and Housing Committee of a county council, the power of declaring a district council to be in default, and in the case of a Guardians Committee (which is a sub-committee of the Public Assistance Committee of the County Council) the power of appointing or dismissing officers.63. The Royal Commission on Local Government recommended in their Final Report, paragraph 352, that a limit should be placed upon the proportion of co-opted members of committees, so as to prohibit the number of co-opted members from exceeding one-third of the total membership of the committee, and that any disqualifica-tions applicable to elected members of committees should apply also to co-opted members (paragraph 342).64. The provisions as to special committees of local authorities referred to in paragraph 62 above are not for the most part within our Terms of Reference, though in some cases they will call for consideration in connection with our investigation of the law relating to public health.We are satisfied, however, as regards the general powers of appointing committees, that the discrepancies in the existing law are no longer justifiable, and accordingly the draft Bill provides
a single code applicable to all types of local authorities.   The main features of the code aro as follows : (a) Local authorities are given a general power of appoint-ing committees and of determining the number of members of each committee and its term of office. Persons who are not members of the authority may bo appointed, but at least two-thirds of the members of the committee must be members of the authority. (This provision widens the existing powers of county and borough councils, but restricts those of district and parish councils) ;(6) Local authorities may delegate, with or without restric-tion, any of their functions to committees, except powers of rating and borrowing;(c) Local authorities may make standing orders for rcgulat-ing the proceedings of committees ;(d) Members of committees who are not members of the local authority are to bo subject to the same disqualifications (including disability on account of interest from voting and taking part in proceedings) as members of the authority.This code will take the place of the general powers of appointing committees in the Public Health Act, 1875, the Municipal Corpora-tions Act, 18S2, and the Local Government Acts of 1888 and 1894. In order to avoid overlapping with special powers in other Acts, a saving has been inserted the effect of which is to prohibit the appoint-ment under the new powers conferred by the Bill of a committee for any purpose for which the local authority are authorised or required to appoint one under other Acts.Joint Committees.65. Under Section SI of the Local Government Act, 18SS, the council of any county or county borough, or any court of quarter sessions or any standing joint committee, may join with other such councils, courts or standing joint committees in appoint-ing a joint committee for any purpose in which they are jointly interested. Membership of such a committee is confined to members of the appointing bodies, and powers of rating and borrowing may not be delegated. The term of office of a joint committee may be fixed by the appointing authorities, but where any members of the joint committee are appointed by a county council the committee are not to hold office beyond three months from the date of the triennial election of county councillors. The appointing authorities may make regulations as to the quorum, proceedings, etc., of tho joint committee, and the proceedings of the joint committee must be reported to the appointing authorities, but the approval of the latter is not required except to such extent as they may direct.
C6. Under Section 57 of the Local Goverment Act, 1S94, district councils (including the councils of non-county boroughs) and parish councils are given a similar power of appointing a joint committee for any purpose in which they are jointly interested. A joint committee so formed ceases to hold office as from the expiration of fourteen days from the date of the annual meeting of any of the appointing bodies. The costs of a joint committee are apportioned between the appointing bodies in such proportions as they agree, or in default of agreement as may be determined by the county council.67. As in the case of ordinary committees of local authorities, a number of statutes provide for the appointment of joint com-mittees, either voluntarily or by an order made by a Central Depart-ment, for tho purposes of the particular statute.68. The draft Bill combines the two codes referred to above and empowers any local authority to combine with any other to form a joint committee for any purpose in which they are jointly interested. This power will leave untouched the special powers of appointing joint committees contained in existing statutes (e.g., Section 3 of the Poor Law Act, 1930) and, in order to avoid overlapping, the functions under tho Acts which provide for these special joint committees are excluded from the scope of joint committees to be set up under the clause. On the other hand, it would, in our opinion, unduly narrow the scope of the general power to appoint joint committees if all cases in which, under a particular statute, there is a power or duty for the authority to act through a com-mittee (as distinct from a joint committee) were excluded. We consider, however, that in those cases any special provisions as to the composition of the committee (e.g., Section 2 (2) of the Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, which requires a committee appointed under the Act to include at least two women) should apply mutatis mutandis to the joint committee.Parochial Committees.69. Section 202 of the Public Health Act, 1S75, enables a rural district council to appoint a parochial committee consisting either wholly of members of the council or partly of those members and partly of &quot; such other persons liable to contribute to the rate levied for the relief of the poor in such contributory place and qualified in such other manner (if any) as the authority forming such parochial committee may determine.&quot;We understand that in practice no additional qualifications are imposed, and in the draft Bill we have not reproduced the power to impose them. Further, we have replaced the reference to ratepayers by a reference to local government electors, and have introduced a similar change in other Clauses of the draft Bill where existing rights of making representations or objections, or of inspecting
documents and so forth, conferred either on ratepayers or on owners or ratepayers, are re-enacted. Attention is called to these changes in the Notes on Clauses. We recommend them not only because the change will accord with the practice of modern legisla-tion, but because it vests the rights in question in a well defined class of persons and enables the claim of a person to exorcise any such right to be easily verified.PART IV.OFFICERS. Glasses of Officers dealt with.70. In dealing with the question of the appointment of officers it is necessary to distinguish between those officers, such as the chief executive and financial officers of a local authority, who are employed on the general work of the authority and those who are wholly engaged in work relating to particular functions of the authority. Obvious examples of the latter class are teachers, relieving officers, public analysts, and inspectors of weights and measures. It is clear that a general Local Government Act could not deal with officers of the latter class without seriously impinging on a large number of codes education, poor law, food and drugs, and so forth. We have accordingly, with some exceptions, confined the draft Bill to what may be termed the general officers of the authority. We have thought it convenient to include amongst these not only the clerk and treasurer, but also the surveyor, medical officer of health, and sanitary inspector, for although the work of these latter officers is to some extent specialised, they have functions under many statutory codes. The draft Bill also deals with the appointment of the whole of the subordinate staff, clerical, accounting and other.Tenure of Office of Medical Officers of Health and Sanitary Inspectors.71. Sections 1 and 2 of the Public Health (Officers) Act, 1921, confers security of tenure, i.e., a tenure under which the officer can be removed from office only by or with the consent of the Minister of Health, on the medical officer of health and senior sanitary inspector of (a) every county borough where any portion of the salary of the officer was paid out of moneys voted by Parliament before it was constituted a county borough ;(6) every borough or urban or rural district where any portion of his salary is paid out of the county fund. The words &quot; out of moneys voted by Parliament &quot; have given rise to some difficulty in the application of this section to county boroughs.   Prior to 1SSS Exchequer Grants were made directly
to local authorities in respect of the salaries of medical officers of health and sanitary inspectors in those cases in which the local authority complied with the regulations made by the Local Govern-ment Board under Section 191 of tho Public Health Act, 1875. These regulations provided, inter alia, that the officers to whom they applied could bo removed from office only by, or with the consent of&quot;, the Board. In some cases the local authority preferred to retain independent control over their medical officer of health and sanitary inspector, and accordingly sacrificed tho Exchequer Grant in respect of the salaries of those officers. The Local Government Act, 1SS8, brought these grants to an end and substituted payments out of the Exchequer Contribution Accounts of county councils, to which were credited the newly assigned revenues and grants. In effect, therefore, the Act of 1888, so far as these grants to local authorities were concerned, merely substituted an indirect for a direct applica-tion of Exchequer money to the purposes in question. The same Act converted the larger boroughs into county boroughs and gave them a share of tho newly assigned revenues and grants based partly upon the amount of the grants paid to them as sanitary authorities before 1888. It happened, therefore, that those county boroughs which had declined before 18S8 to accept an Exchequer Grant in respect of the salaries of their medical officer of health and sanitary inspector received a relatively smaller share of the new revenues than those county boroughs which had previously accepted the Exchequer Grant. Similarly, many of the non-county boroughs preferred to continue after 188S to have unfettered control over their officers and to sacrifice the grant which would otherwise have been payable by the county council. The grants assigned by the Act of 1888 continued until 1930, when they were replaced by the new Exchequer Contributions payable under the Local Government Act, 1929. County councils are required, however, by that Act to continue to make payments towards the salaries of medical officers of health and sanitary inspectors where the terms of their appointment are in accordance with the regulations made under the Act of 1875.The Bill for the Act of 1921 as introduced gave security of tenure to every whole-time medical officer of health and sanitary inspector, but was amended during its passage tln-ough Parliament in order to exclude the officers of those councils which had retained unfettered control over their officers at the price of sacrificing grants, either from the Exchequer or the county council. It has been suggested, however, that the words in Sections 1 (a) and 2 (1) (a) of the Act, &quot; out of moneys voted by Parliament,&quot; can apply only to the pre-1888 system of Exchequer grants and not to the post-lSSS grants made by county councils. The effect of this interpretation woidd be to leave the medical officers of health and sanitary inspectors of all county boroughs constituted since 188S without security of tenure, notwithstanding that the council of the county borough
may have accepted grants from the county council before being constituted a county borough.72. We arc satisfied that this interpretation of the Act is not in accordance with the intention of the Legislature, and we under-stand that it is not the interpretation which has been generally acted upon by the Ministry of Health and local authorities. In order, however, to remove the doubts which exist we have provided in the draft Bill that the medical officer of health and senior sanitary inspector of a county borough shall have security of tenure, if any portion of the salary of that officer was paid by the county council before it was constituted a county borough.Tenure of Office of Officers generally.73. Apart from the removal of the doubts referred to above, wo have been careful to reproduce the existing law on the question of &quot; security of tenure.&quot; We have, however, considered it within our Terms of Reference to give effect to the recommendation made by the Royal Commission on Local Government (Final Report, paragraph 471) and to remedy the defect in the law to which atten-tion was called in Brown v. Dagenliam U.D.O. (1929) 1 K.B. 737. The draft Bill accordingly enables a local authority to agree with any officer who holds office during the pleasure of the local authority that it shall be a term of his appointment that the appointment is not to be terminated by either party without reasonable notice. This provision will apply to all officers of a local authority, whether appointed under the Bill or under other enactments, e.g., under Section 148 of the Education Act, 1921, but will not affect existing officers.Deputies.74. There is a great diversity of procedure in the existing law for dealing with cases where an officer is unable to act owing to absence or incapacity, or the office is rendered vacant by death or resignation. Thus, in the case of the clerk of a county council there is power under Section S3 (4) of the Local Government Act, 1SS8, as amended by the Local Government (Clerks) Act, 1931, to appoint a standing deputy clerk, and a further power under the Recorders, Stipendiary Magistrates and Clerks of the Peace Act, 1900, as extended by the Act of 1931, to appoint a temporary deputy. A temporary county treasurer may be appointed under Section 43 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, as applied to county councils by the Local Government Act, 18SS. In the case of the county medical officer of health, there is power to appoint a temporary deputy under Section 6S of the Housing, Town Plan-ning, etc., Act, 1909. In the case of boroughs, there is power under Section 17 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 18S2, to appoint a standing deputy town clerk, and under Section 43 to appoint a temporary town clerk or temporary borough treasurer.   In the50S8 B3
case of the medical officer of health of a borough or urban or rural district, there is power to make a temporary appointment either under Section 191 of the Public Health Act, 1875, or under Section 4 of the Public Health (Officers) Act, 1921, and a temporary sanitary inspector may also be appointed under Section 4 of the Act of 1921. On the other hand, there is no power to appoint either a standing deputy or a temporary deputy in any of the following cases, viz. :  county surveyor, borough surveyor, or clerk, treasurer or surveyor to an urban or rural district council.75. We have provided in the draft Bill a single code under which deputies (both standing and temporary) may be appointed in respect of all the officers named above. The distinction is maintained between tho appointment of standing deputies and the appoint-ment of deputies to fill vacancies created unexpectedly by death or otherwise, or to act during incapacity.Payments by County Councils towards the Salaries of temporary Medical Officers of Health and Sanitary Inspectors.76. There appears to be some doubt whether the obligation of a county council to pay one-half of the salary of a medical officer of health or sanitary inspector extends to the salary of a deputy when acting in place of the principal officer, although we under-stand that such payments are generally made. In order to remove this doubt we have inserted in the draft Bill a provision requiring such payments to be made where the deputy is acting during a vacancy in the principal office. We consider, however, that the vacancy caused by the death or retirement of a medical officer of health or sanitary inspector ought to be filled within a reasonable period by the appointment of a permanent successor, and we have accordingly provided for the vacancy being filled within six months.Interest of Officers in Contracts.77. Section 193 of the Public Health Act, 1S75, provides that &quot; officers or servants appointed or employed under this Act by the local authority &quot; (i.e., the council of a borough or urban or rural district) &quot; shall not in anywise be concerned or interested in any bargain or contract made with such authority for any of the purposes of this Act.&quot; An officer or servant who contravenes this pro-vision, or accepts any fee or reward other than his salary, is rendered incapable ever afterwards of holding or continuing to hold any office under the Act and is liable to a penalty of  50.This section, which was a reproduction of Section 3S of the Public Health Act, 1848, was amended by the Public Health (Officers) Act, 1SS4, which provides that proceedings for the re-covery of the penalty are not to be taken without the written consent of the Attorney-General, and by Section 2 of the Public
Health (Members and Officers) Act, 1885, &quot;which introduced two exceptions, viz. : (a) contracts with the local authority for the sale, purchase, leasing, or hiring of lands, rooms or offices, where the consent has been obtained of two-thirds of the members of the authority present at a meeting of which special notice has been given ; and(b) contracts in which the officer or servant is interested as a shareholder in a joint-stock company.7S. In so far as Section 193 of the Act of 1875 prohibits officers from exacting or accepting any fee or reward other than his proper salary, wages and allowances, the section appears to have been rendered unnecessary by the passing of the Prevention of Corrup-tion Acts, 1889 to 1916, the long title of the Act of 1S89 being &quot;An Act for the more effectual Prevention and Punishment of Bribery and Corruption of and by Members, Officers or Servants of Corporations, Councils, Boards, Commissioners or other Public Bodies.&quot;79. It is to be observed that Section 193 of the Act of 1S75 applies only to officers or servants of borough or district councils appointed or employed wider the Act of 1S75, and only to bargains or contracts made by such-officers with the council for the purposes of that Act.A similar restriction is contained in Section 39 of the Baths and Washhouses Act, 1846, and applies to officers appointed under that Act by the councils of boroughs, urban districts and rural parishes, in respect of contracts made for the purposes of that Act.There is no similar restriction in the case of officers of county councils, or in the case of officers of borough, district or parish councils appointed under enactments other than the Public Health Acts or the Baths and Washhouses Acts, or in the case of officers appointed under those Acts in respect of contracts made for the purposes of other enactments.As illustrative of the effect of the present law the following hypothetical cases may be instanced (a) A borough council invite public subscriptions to a loan for the purpose of erecting a hospital under the Public Health Acts. The town clerk and borough treasurer, being appointed under the Municipal Corporations Act, may subscribe to the loan; but the medical officer of health, sanitary inspector and surveyor of the borough may not subscribe, as they are appointed under the Public Health Act;(b) An urban district council invite public subscriptions to a loan for the same purpose. The clerk and treasurer of the counci , as well as the medical officer of health, sanitary inspector and surveyor, are prohibited from subscribing, as they are all appointed under the Public Health Act;50S3 B4
(c) A clerk to a district council may sell land to his council for the purpose of a housing site, but if the land is required for the site of a sewage farm the special procedure laid down in the Act of 1885 must be followed.80. There is clearly no case for maintaining these distinctions, and the alternatives are (a) to extend the existing law, with or without modification, to all types of local authorities and to all classes of officers, or (6) to repeal Section 193 of the Act of 1875 and the amending provisions in the Acts of 1884 and 18S5.We believe that it is generally recognised that under present conditions permanent disqualification for the local government service is a more severe penalty than under the conditions which obtained when the Act of 1S75 was jmssed, and might in many cases be out of all proportion to the offence. Having regard to this, to the very restricted application which tho section now has, and to the fact that since 184S the Legislature has not thought it necessary to make any corresponding provision in the case of officers of other authorities or of officers appointed under other enactments, we consider that the better course is to repeal Section 193 of the Act of 1S75 without re-enactment. This repeal will not affect the operation of tho Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1S89 to 191G, in the case of officers improperly accepting fees or rewards.Security.81. Under Section 20 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 18S2 (extended to county councils by the Local Government Act, 18SS) every officer of a county or borough council is required to give security for the due execution of his office. Under Section 194 of the Public Health Act, 1875, which relates to borough, urban and rural district councils, the obligation to give security is limited to officers employed under that Act and who are entrusted with the custody and control of money. Officers employed by rating authorities (i.e., borough and district councils) under the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, are required to give security, but in this case the council may bear the cost of providing the security (Section 55 of the Act). In the case of poor law officers, provision for security is made by Section 10 of the Poor Law Act, 1930, and the Minister of Health is empowered to direct the nature and amount of the security to be given and the officers by whom it is to be given. Section 17 (6) of the Local Government Act, 1S94, requires security to be given by the treasurer of a parish council.There is clearly no good reason why in the case of county and borough councils officers of all kinds should be required to give security, whereas in the case of urban and rural district councils the requirement should be limited to officers in the Public Health service who are entrusted with money. Moreover, we have been reminded that at least in one instance, namely that of teachers in
non-provided schools, officers who are paid but not appointed by the local education authority frequently handle substantial amounts of the authority&apos;s money, and we understand that some authorities make a practice themselves of taking out fidelity policies to cover these cases.   Accordingly we recommend (a) That local authorities should bo required to take security in the case of all officers employed by them who are likely to be entrusted with the custody or control of money ;(6) that they should be empowered to take security in the case of other officers employed by them, e.g., those entrusted with goods ;(c) that they should be empowered to insure the fidelity of other persons, e.g., teachers in non-provided schools, who handle money belonging to the authority, by themselves taking out policies at their own expense ; and(d) that, as regards officers falling under (a) or (6) above, they should be empowered to effect the insurance themselves at their own expense as an alternative to requiring the officer to give security.Appointment of Members of Local Authorities to paid Offices.82. Under Sections 17 and IS of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1SS2, a borough council may not appoint a member of the council to be town clerk or borough treasurer. The same rule applies to the office of county treasurer if the county council decide to make the appointment under Section IS of the Act of 1SS2 (see Section 75, proviso 1G (e), of the Local Government Act, 1SSS). Under Section I (2) of the Coroners (Amendment) Act, 1926, an interval of six months must elapse between the date when a jDerson ceases to hold office as a member of a county or borough council and the date when he becomes eligible for appointment by the council to the office of coroner. Similar provision was made in orders issued by the Minister of Health under poor law legislation, the period in that case being twelve months. We understand that it has for many years been the practice of the Ministry, and previously of the Local Government Board, to decline to approve any appointment which requires the approval of the Department if the person appointed has been within the previous twelve months a member of the appointing authority.We are clear that there is no case for limiting a provision of this kind to the offices of town clerk and borough or county treasurer, and we think that on general grounds of policy it should be extended to all local government officers. But a provision on the lines of Sections 17 and IS of the Act of 1SS2, which merely prevents an existing member of the council from being appointed, is largely ineffective, since it is simple for the member to resign his membership hefore the appointment actually takes effect.   We are satisfied
that some substantial period must be inserted if the provision is to effect its objects, and following the precedent set by Parliament in the Coroners (Amendment) Act, 192G, we recommend that the period between cessation of membership and appointment should be six months. A Clause (Clause 121) to this effect has accordingly been inserted in the draft Bill.PART V.OFFICES AND BUILDINGS.Provision of Offices, etc.83. By Section 105 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1SS2, a borough council may purchase land, not exceeding five acres, and may build thereon, inter alia, a town hall, council house or other building necessary or proper for any purposes of the borough. By Section 197 of the Public Health Act, 1875, an urban authority (which includes a borough council) is required to provide and main-tain &quot; offices &quot; for transacting the business of the authority under the Act. Under the Act of 1SS2 the power to purchase land is by agreement only*; under that of 1875 the authority may be authorised by means of a provisional order to acquire land com-pulsorily.We understand that inconvenience has arisen in the past from the different language used by the two Acts, and that in consequence of the doubt whether the power to purchase &quot; offices &quot; under Section 197 covers the provision of a hall for meetings, it has been the practice of the Ministry of Health and their predecessors to invest the councils of boroughs and of urban districts with the powers of a parish council under Section S (1) (a) of the Local Government Act, 1894, thereby enabling them to provide buildings &quot; for public offices and for meetings.&quot;In order to clear up this doubt the draft Bill provides that local authorities may provide offices, halls or other buildings for the purposes of transacting the business of the council and for public meetings and assemblies.Parochial Buildings.84. Under the Vestries Act, 1S50, a vestry room may be provided for a parish having a population exceeding 2,000; and in parishes having a population exceeding 4,000, an office for the transaction of business may be provided under Section 1 of the Parochial Offices Act, 1861. By Section S (1) of the Local Government Act, 1894, a parish council may provide or acquire buildings for public* Under the Public Works Facilities Act, 1930, there is a temporary power to acquire land compulsorily for the purposes of Section 105 of the Act of 1S82.
offices and for meetings, and for purposes connected with parish business.S5. In paragraph IS above we recommend that the remaining civil functions of vestries in urban parishes should be transferred to the borough or urban district council, and if this recommendation is adopted, such functions will become those of the borough or district council, who will have power to provide any necessary buildings under the provisions referred to in paragraph 83. In rural parishes having a parish council, the council ahead3&apos; have power to provide necessary buildings under Section 8 of the Act of 1S94, and the same power can, if necessary, be conferred on the parish meeting of a parish not having a parish council by an order of the county council under Section 19 of the Act of 1S94. We have accordingly treated the provisions of the Vestries Act, 1S50, and of the Parochial Offices Act, 1861, relating to the provision of vestry rooms and offices, as no longer necessary, and have provided in the draft Bill for their repeal.PART VI.ALTERATION OF AREAS.Cliartcrs of Incorporation.S6. The first nine Clauses of Part VI of the draft Bill reproduce Part XI of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1S82, dealing with the grant of charters of incorporation. Some alterations, which are referred to in the Notes on Clauses, including the substitution of a petition by the district council for a petition by inhabitant house-holders, as recommended by the Royal Commission, have been introduced in order to bring the procedure into conformity with modern practice.Alteration of Boundaries, etc.87. The remaining Clauses in Part VI of the draft Bill re-produce the provisions of the Local Government Acts of 1SS8, 1894 and 1929, dealing with the alteration of local government boundaries, the union and division of local government areas, and the creation of new areas and authorities. With a view to simplifying and shortening the law the draft Bill repeals, without re-enactment, two other codes relating to the same subject-matter : (a) Section 270 (1) and (2), and Sections 271 to 274, of the Public Health Act, 1875 ;(6) Sections 1 to 9 of the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act, 1S76 ; Sections 4 to 7 of the Poor Law Act, 1879 ; and Sections 2 to 7 of the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act, 18S2.
Wc understand that the powers of the Public Health Act referred to above, which are substantially similar to those conferred on county councils by Section 57 of the Local Government Act, 1S8S, have not been exercised since the commencement of the last-mcn-tioned Act. Some use has, however, been made of Section 270 (3) of the Act of 1875, which enables the Minister of Health to dissolve special drainage districts, and this subsection is left outstanding by the draft Bill.As regards the provisions referred to in (6) above, the powers conferred by these Acts were saved by Section 57 (7) of the Local Government Act, 1888, but having regard to the provisions of that section and the later provisions of the Acts of 1894 and 1929, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances in which it would be necessary or convenient to make use of the earlier codes. We understand, moreover, that no order has been mado under those provisions since 1912, and we are satisfied that they may properly be repealed as obsolete.Compensation for Loss of Office, etc.S8. The draft Bill provides for the payment of compensation for loss of office or diminution of emoluments arising from altera-tions of areas and authorities effected by schemes and orders made under the Bill. The existing law is contained in Section 120 of the Local Government Act, 1SSS. Since the passing of that Act, however, a number of additions to, and amendments of, the com-pensation code, chiefly based on provisions in local Acts and pro-visional orders, have been introduced into the general legislation, in particular by the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, and the Local Government Act, 1929. We have felt it impossible to disregard these, and we have accordingly based our proposals on the law as enacted in the Act of 1929. In adopting this course we have had to take account of two considerations : (a) In a Bill intended to clarify the law of local government it would be indefensible to follow the language of the Act of 1929 in legislating by reference to Treasury rules in operation so long ago as 1888, and the more so because, as we understand, no rules in the ordinary acceptance of the term were ever made or published. We have accordingly omitted this reference, and in its place reproduced what we understand the Treasury practice at that date to have been ;(6) Section 120 of the Act of 1SSS imposed, by reference to civil service practice, a limit to the amount of compensation payable, but within that limit left the whole matter to the discretion of the local authority, or, on appeal, the appellate authority. Parliament contented itself with providing that regard was to be had to various considerations, e.g., conditions of employment, duration of service, etc., set out in the section.
Most of the later accretions, now appearing in the Act of 1929, appear, however, to presuppose a more exact method of calculation; see, for example, paragraphs 5 and 7 of the Eighth Schedule to the Act of 1929. We are satisfied, however, that in the absence of a general system of distinguishing between &quot; established &quot; and &quot; unestablished &quot; posts in the local govern-ment service it is not practicable to reduce the element of discretion any further, and accordingly, apart from some modifications of detail referred to in the Notes on Clauses, the draft Bill follows the general lines of the Local Government Act, 1929.S9. The recent Committee on Local Expenditure considered the provisions of the Compensation Code dealing with &quot; added years,&quot; that is to say, the requirement that in certain circumstances a number of years, not exceeding ten, is to be added to the actual number of years of service for the purpose of calculating the amount of compensation payable, and recommended that the existing law should be amended so as to permit of discretion being used in deciding whether any, and if so what number of, years should be added in determining the amount of compensation payable (paragraph 238). -We have considered this matter, but it is clear that any amend-ment of this nature would raise questions of a controversial nature, and wo have accordingly regarded it as outside our Terms of Refer -ence.PART VII.ACQUISITION OF, AND DEALINGS IN, LAND.Acquisition of Land.90. There is a remarkable lack of uniformity in the various statutes relating to the acquisition of land by local authorities. Under the Local Government Act, 1S88, county councils have a general power to acquire land, either by agreement or compulsorily, for &quot; the purpose of any of their powers and duties.&quot; The other types of local authorities have no such power, and consequently whenever further functions have been conferred on them which render the acquisition of land necessary, a fresh power to acquire land for those purposes has had to be given. This power has in some cases been a power to acquire land by agreement or compul-compulsorily, in others to acquire land by agreement only.91. The present is one of the cases to which we have drawn attention in paragraph 9 above, where an assimilation of the law which had the effect of giving all types of local authorities power to acquire land either by agreement or compulsorily for all purposes would involve a drastic amendment of the law. Accordingly, while we have provided in the draft Bill that all local authorities
should be empowered to acquire land by agreement for the purposes of any of their functions, we do not suggest any extension of com-pulsory powers.Compulsory Acquisition of Land.92. The provisions relating to the compulsory acquisition of land are complicated by reason of the existence of two methods of procedure (a) by means of a provisional order made by a Govern-ment Department and confirmed by Parliament; and (b) by means of an order made by the local authority and confirmed by a Govern -ment Department. The &quot; provisional order &quot; procedure normally applies to acquisitions under the Local Government Act, 1SSS, the Public Health Act, 1875, and also to acquisitions of land under the statutes relating to bridges, diseases of animals, isolation hospitals, mental defectives, mental hospitals, military lands and poor law. The &quot; departmental order &quot; code applies for the purposes of allotments, education, housing, public libraries, road improve-ments, small holdings, and town planning.The draft Bill includes both procedures. Its effect will be that as regards existing powers of acquiring land the law will remain unaltered, the &quot; provisional order &quot; procedure being used in cases where it is now necessary, and the &quot; departmental order &quot; procedure being limited to cases where, under existing Acts, Parliament has sanctioned it. As regards powers for the compulsory acquisition of land which may be conferred by future legislation, it will be for the Legislature to decide which of the two alternative methods of procedure is to apply. For the purposes of future legislation Part VII of the Bill will in fact play the part of a &quot; Clauses &quot; Act, and will obviate the necessity of encumbering future Acts with detailed provisions relating to acquisition of land.*Acquisition of Land in advance of requirements.93. Under the existing law local authorities have no general power to acquire land in advance of requirements, but under the Housing Act, 1925, and the Allotments Act, 1925, a power of this nature was conferred on local authorities for the purpose of acquiring land for housing or allotments. Many local authorities have also been given a general power to acquire land in advance of require-ments by local Acts.In the case of allotments, the land may be acquired either by agreement or compulsorily, but in the case of housing and, it is bebeved, under all local Acts the power is liniited to acquisition by agreement.* Note. Wo havo disregarded tho Public Works Facilities Act, 1930, under which local authorities having compulsory powers of acquisition may acquire land in every case by way of a &quot; departmental order.&quot; Tho Act is a temporary one, designed to meet exceptional circumstances, and is .left outstanding by the draft Bill.
In view of the precedents referred to above, and the freedom with which Parliament has granted the power in local legislation, wc have felt justified in including in the draft Bill a general power for all local authorities to acquire land, by agreement and with the oonsent of the appropriate Department, in advance of requirements for the purposes of any of their powers and duties.Parish Property.94. Parish property usually consists of old parish workhouses and cottages provided by the overseers of the poor before the establishment of boards of guardians under the Poor Law Amend-ment Act, 1S34, or of lands which were acquired by the overseers of a parish for the employment of the poor of the parish. In some parishes, parochial offices and vestry rooms have also been provided by overseers, and these are also parish property.95. Before the Local Government Act, 1894, parish property was vested in the overseers of the parish, but the Union and Parish Property Act, 1S35, provided that the power of selling and leasing was to be exercised, not by the overseers, but by the board of guardians with the consent of the owners and ratepayers of the parish and of the Local Government Board.By Sections 5 and 19 of the Local Government Act, 1S94, the legal interest in parish property in a rural parish was transferred to the parish council, or, in the case of a rural parish not having a parish council, to a corporate body consisting of the chairman of the parish meeting and the overseers. On the abolition of over-seers by the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, this latter body was superseded by the &quot; representative body &quot; of the parish set up under the Overseers Order, 1927. The Act of 1894 did not affect the position as regards parish property in urban areas, except where the provisions relating to rural parishes were applied to an urban area by an order made under Section 33 of the Act; b .t by virtue of the Overseers Order, 1927, and Section 115 of the Local Govern-ment Act, 1929, parish property in urban areas is now vested in the borough or urban district council.96. The Union and Parish Property Act, 1835, referred to above was repealed partly by the Poor Law Act, 1927, and partly by the Local Government Act, 1929, and the code now governing the sale and letting of parish property is to be found in Section 115 of, and the Seventh Schedule to, the latter Act. There are, however, a number of objections to re-enacting these provisions as they stand, the principal one being that while the definition of &quot; parish property &quot; in Section 115 (6) of the Act of 1929 adequately dis-tinguishes the property which is intended to be covered by the term from property held on special charitable trusts or acquired for the relief of the poor, there is nothing in the definition to dis-distinguish &quot; parish property &quot; from property acquired under Section
8 of the Local Government Act, 1894, by a parish council, or, if the requisite powers have been conferred on it, by the &quot; representative body &quot; of a parish not having a parish council. Moreover, it does not seem practicable to draw any satisfactory distinction. Land given to a parish council for the benefit of the inhabitants of the parish under Section 8 (1) (h) of the Act of 1894 is, for prac-tical purposes, indistinguishable from land given for the same inrrposes to the overseers of the parish before the passing of the Act of 1894. The Act of 1929, moreover, contained an express saving for the power of sale contained in the Act of 1894 ; see Section 115 (2) of the Act of 1929.Hence the code for disposing of land and deaUng with the pro-cceds of sales in Sections 8 (2) and 9 (13) of tho Act of 1894 overlaps with that contained in the Seventh Schedule to the Act of 1929, and in fact the two codes say much the same thing in different terms, the provisions of the Act of 1929 being the more elaborate of the two.   The only points of substance in which they differ are (a) under the Act of 1894, but not under the Act of 1929, the parish council have power to let land for more than one year without the consent of the parish meeting;(6) the Act of 1929 provides for land taken in exchange being held on the same trusts as the original land ;(c) the Act of 1929 exempts leases and conveyances from stamp duty ;(d) the Act of 1894 applies Sections 128 to 131 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845 (right of pre-emption).97. We recommend that, so far as rural parishes are concerned, the distinction between &quot; parish property &quot; and property falling under Section S of the Act of 1S94 should be abandoned, and that the powers of that Act relating to the sale, exchange and letting of parish land, and the provisions relating to the proceeds of sales, should apply to parish property as defined in Section 115 (6) of the Act of 1929.With regard to &quot; parish property &quot; in urban parishes, as stated in paragraph 95 above this property is now vested in the borough or urban district council, and we recommend that the provisions relating to the sale or letting of other lands vested in such councils should apply to the sale or letting of &quot; parish property,&quot; with a special provision requiring the proceeds of such sale to be applied for the benefit of the parish.Exhausted Parish Lands. 9S. By a large number of Inclosure Awards plots of land were allotted to surveyors of highways as quarries for the supply of road materials.   In some cases the use of the materials was re-restricted to the repair of the public highways in the highway parish,
but in other cases they were to be used not only for the repair of the public highways but also for the purposes of private roads in the highway parish or other purposes.99. By the Local Government Act, 1S94, surveyors of highways and highway parishes in rural areas were abolished, and allotments vested in the surveyors of highways were transferred to the rural district councils. Section 117 of the Public Health Act, 1848, had already provided that in an urban area the council should be the surveyor of highways, and Section 6S of that Act transferred to the council the property of any surveyor of highways in the district.100. Many of these allotments have been worked out and the materials in them are exhausted. If the land was originally allotted for the purpose of obtaining materials for the repair of the public highways only in the parish, the land may be sold by the borough, urban or rural district council under Section 48 of the Highway Act, 1S35, and Section 1 of the Highway Act, 1845, the proceeds of the sale being used for the purchase of other land. On the other hand, if the exhausted allotment was originally allotted for the purpose of the supply of materials for the repair of the public roads and highways in a parish and also for the repair of private roads or some other purpose, public or private, the land could only be sold under the Sale of Exhausted Parish Lands Act, 1876. Now, however, if sold, it must be sold under the provisions of the Seventh Schedule to the Local Government Act, 1929 (relating to the sale of parish property), but &quot; subject to the provisions of the Act of 1876.&quot;101. We understand that the amount of land to which the provisions of the Highway Acts or of the Act of 1876 apply is small, and we recommend that, as in the case of parish property, the ordinary provisions relating to the sale, exchange and letting of land vested in local authorities should apply to these exhausted -parish lands, subject to the provision that the proceeds of the sale are to be applied to the benefit of the parish.PART VIII.EXPENSES.102. The bulk of the existing law relating to the expenses of local authorities and parish meetings is contained in the following enactments: Expenses of county councils : Sections 6S, 74 and SO of the Local Government Act, 1SSS ;Expenses of borough councils : Sections 139 to 143 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1SS2, and Section 207 of the Public Health Act, 1S75 ;Expenses of urban district councils: Section 207 of the Public Health Act, 1875 ;
Expenses of rural district councils : Section 229 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and Section 29 of the Local Govern-ment Act, 1S94 ;Expenses of parish councils : Section 11 of the Local Govcrn-ment Act, 1894 ;Expenses of parish meetings: Sections 11 and 19 of tho Local Government Act, 1894.As regards borough and district councils, the provisions of the Acts of 1875 and 18S2 have been substantially affected by the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, which substituted a &quot; general rate &quot; and &quot; general rate fund &quot; for the various rates and funds previously existing.103. In our consideration of this subject our attention was drawn to two points of major importance : (a) The Act of 1S88 contains detailed provisions with regard to the control of expenditure of comity councils, the operation of banking accounts, etc. In particular the establishment of a finance committee of the county council is obligatory, and important duties are imposed on the committee. As respects borough councils, the Act of 1882 contains pro-visions of a somewhat similar but less detailed kind. It makes, however, no provision for the establishment of a special finance committee, though under the general power of appointing committees which the Act contains finance committees of borough councils are commonly appointed. As respects district councils, on the other hand, the public Health Act contains no provisions whatever on these subjects, the whole matter being in practice dealt with by regulations in the nature of standing orders of the council.(6) A number of the provisions of the Act of 1888, and to a less extent those of the Act of 1882, are out of accord with modern practice and, if strictly interpreted, are not compatible with the transaction of business on the scale which the Legis-lature has now imposed on county and borough councils. We understand that various expedients, some of doubtful validity, are adopted in order to endeavour to reconcile practice with legal requirements. Thus, under Section 80 of the Act of 1SS8 all payments to and out of the county fund must be made to and by the county treasurer, but it is common for payments to be made direct to the account at a bank kept in the name of the county council. The same section provides that liabilities exceeding  50 may only be incurred on the resolution of the council passed on an estimate submitted by the finance committee, a requirement which, we understand, is in practice constantly and necessarily disregarded. Our attention was called to other points of a similar kind.
We originally hoped to deal with both these points (a) by drafting a single code applicable to all local authorities (with the possible exception of parish councils); and (b) by embodying in the code amendments which would bring the law into conformity with modern conditions. A number of suggestions for such amend-commitments  were in fact submitted to us by the Institute of Municipal Treasurers and Accountants. On further consideration, however, we have satisfied ourselves that the adoption of either of these courses would raise controversial questions, and would be beyond our Terms of Reference. Assimilation of procedure would either involve imposing for the first time on district councils a detailed code, or alternatively repealing the codes now applying to county and borough councils. Similarly, it would involve either the compulsory establishment of finance committees in boroughs and urban and rural districts, or the repeal of the provisions of the Act of 1888 with regard to finance committees in counties. In this connection attention is drawn to the recent Report of the Committee on Local Expenditure which recommended that all local authorities &quot; shall be required by statute to appoint Finance Committees with powers and duties similar to those of the Finance Committees of County Councils&quot; (paragraph 243). There is clearly room for controversy on these and other points with which it would be necessary to deal if a single code was to be framed on modern lines, and we have come to the conclusion, though with some regrets, that the whole matter would be more appropriate to a separate measure. Apart, therefore, from some minor amendments to which attention is called in the Notes on Clauses, we have limited our-selves in Part VIII of the Bill to assimilating the language of the various statutes so far as that is possible within the framework of the existing law.PART IX.BORROWING. Uniform Code.104. As in the case of the provisions dealing with the acquisition of land, the existing law on the subject of borrowing by local authorities is complicated by the fact that county councils and parish councils have a general power to borrow for any works or things which they have power to execute or do, and the cost of which ought to be spread over a term of years, whereas the borrowing powers con-ferred on borough and urban and rural district councils by the Public Health Acts are limited to borrowings for public health purposes. As a consequence of this limitation Parliament has been compelled in a large number of statutes to confer on borough, urban and rural district councils fresh borrowing powers, either by reference to the public health borrowing code or by means of a fresh code.   In the
great majority of cases the borrowing powers have been conferred by means of a reference to the public health code, but occasionally some Department other than the Ministry of Health is made tho authority for sanctioning loans, and in a few instances the maximum period for repayment of a loan differs from the period (60 years) provided in that code.105. The draft Bill provides a single code, based for the most part on the provisions of the Public Health Acts, which will be available for all statutory purposes, existing and future, for which borrowing powers are required ; and supersedes all those in existing Acts which are either based on the borrowing powers of the Public Health Acts or are substantially similar to that code. In those cases in which the sanctioning authority or the term for the repay-ment of the loan differs from the normal, the difference is preserved.106. In dealing with the subject of borrowing we were faced by the fact that for many years past Parliament has authorised the insertion in local Acts of provisions which render the borrowing powers more elastic, and supplement the powers conferred by the general law. The attention of the recent Select Committee of the House of Commons on Private Bill Procedure was called to this point, and in their report (H.C. 158 of 1930) they recommended that a Public Bill should be introduced every five years to make general the provisions usually inserted in local Acts. In these circumstances we have thought it right, as regards this particular subject, to take a somewhat wide view of our functions and have inserted in the draft Bill a number of clauses deahng with matters of procedure and machinery which are based on local Act clauses and have frequently received the approval of Parliament. It will be seen that in a number of cases these clauses amplify the Public Health Acts by providing, in connection with mortgages, for matters which are already dealt with by the Local Loans Acts, 1875, and the Stock Regulations issued under Section 70 of the Local Government Act, 188S, and Section 52 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, in coimection with securities issued under those codes.Methods of Borrowing.107. The three principal methods by which loans are raised are : (a) by mortgages under the Public Health Acts or under enactments applying those Acts ;(b) by the issue of stock under the Stock Regulations made under Section 52 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1S90, or, in the case of county councils, under Section 70 of the Local Government Act, 1SS8 ;(c) by the issue of debentures or annuity certificates under the Local Loans Act, 1875.
Comparatively little use has been made of the last-mentioned Act, the issues made under it representing approximately 1.3 per cent, of the whole amount of loans effected by local authorities. The Departmental Committee on Trustee Securities appointed by Lord Cave, L.C., in 1926, recommended the repeal of the Act, though recognising that it was used extensively by the Corporation of the City of London (Cmd. 3107/1928, paragraph 21). The question of the repeal of the Act scarcely falls within our Terms of Reference, and as no inconvenience would arise by leaving the Act outstanding as a separate code, the draft Bill has been prepared on that footing.Security.10S. The existing law contains a wide variety of provisions with regard to the security upon which money may be borrowed by local authorities. In accordance with the modern policy of Parliament in local Acts, we have provided in the draft Bill that the whole of the authority&apos;s revenues are to be charged.Priorities.109. Put shortly, the existing law with regard to priorities is as follows: Mortgages made under the Public Health Acts charge such proportion of the rates as the sum borrowed bears to the total borrowings on the rates in question, and the mortgages accordingly rank pari passu (see Form of Mortgage in the Fourth Schedule to the Public Health Act, 1S75). The Stock Regulations issued under Section 70 of the Local Government Act, 1S88, and Section 52 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, provide for stock ranking pari passu with other stock issued under the regulations and, unless otherwise expressed in the resolution creating the stock, with all other securities created by the local authority after the first issue of any stock under the regulations (Article 2 (2) of the County Stock Regulations, 1891, and of the Stock Regulations, 1S91). Loans raised under the Local Loans Act, 1875, take priority according to the date of the loan, but sums raised in respect of the same loan rank pari passu (Section 8 of the Act).Apart from the provision in the Stock Regulations referred to above there is nothing in the existing codes dealing with the question of priorities as between loans raised under different Acts. A system under which the same authority operating under one code may create a number of loans which rank pari passu, and operating under another may create a series which rank in order of date, would lead to inextricable confusion if the question of priority ever became one of importance to the creditors, and in order to clear up the position the draft Bill, following many local Act precedents, provides that, subject to existing priorities, all sums borrowed by a local authority are to rank equally.
110. Under all the above-mentioned enactments, the security on which money may be borrowed is income, viz., rates or revenue. There are, however, two cases in which a local authority may borrow on the mortgage of land (a) the corporation of a borough may mortgage corporate land under Section 109 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882;  and(6) a local authority for the purposes of the Public Health Acts may borrow for public health purposes on the security of sewage disposal works under Section 235 of the Public Health Act, 1875.The power of mortgaging corporate land is reproduced in the draft Bill. Section 235 of the Public Health Act, 1875, has not, so far as we are aware, been extensively used, and the better course appears to be to leave it as part of the public health code and not extend it to purposes other than those of public health. It is, therefore, left outstanding.PART X.ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT.111. The principal enactments relating to the accounts of local authorities and the audit of those accounts are the District Auditors Act, 1879 ; Sections 245 to 247 of the Public Health Act, 1875 ; Sections 25 to 27 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 18S2 ; and the Audit (Local Authorities) Act, 1927.The outstanding feature of the present law is the existence of two codes, one applying, with certain exceptions, to borough councils, the other to other local authorities. The recently issued report of the Committee on Local Expenditure recom-mends, though the recommendation is not unanimous, that the accounts of municipal corporations should be subject to district audit (paragraph 244). We are satisfied, however, that whether or not an assimilation of the law by abolishing municipal audit and making borough councils subject to district audit would be desirable, such a course would raise controversial issues and is outside our Terms of Reference. The draft Bill accordingly maintains without alteration the existing law on this matter.112. Apart from the points dealt with in the Notes on Clauses, the only further matter on this subject to which we need call attention is one relating to the District Auditors Act, 1879. That Act, which established a central audit department, provides for the expenses of the department being met by fees payable by the authorities whose accounts are audited, and treats the country as a whole, including London, as a single unit for the purpose of calcu-lating the scale of fees payable for this purpose. As a consequence,
it is hardly practicable in reproducing this Act to divorce London from the provinces. Theoretically, the proper course would be to reproduce in the draft Bill the audit law with the omission of the provisions of the Act of 1879 relating to the appointment and duties of the central staff and the payment of its expenses. But these provisions are so closely bound up with the rest of the Act that this course is in our view impracticable, and accordingly the only alter-natives appear to be to omit audit law from the draft Bill altogether and deal with it in a separate measure applying to London as well as to the provinces, or to extend the Audit provisions of the draft Bill to London. By our Terms of Reference we are precluded from dealing with the law relating to London, but we think that in the present instance it would be unfortunate to omit from the draft Bill so essential a part of local government law, and that the most convenient course would be to apply Part X of the draft Bill to London.113. The law of district audit has been applied by later legis-lation to various bodies, such as the Metropolitan Water Board, which are not local authorities within the meaning of the draft Bill. Here, again, we think that practical convenience lies on the side of dealing with the audit of these bodies in the draft Bill not-withstanding that in general they fall outside its ambit.As will be seen from paragraph 116 below, the same problem arises in connection with Local Financial Returns.PART XI.LOCAL FLNANCLAL RETURNS.114. The main codes relating to local financial returns are the Local Taxation Returns Acts of 1860 and 1877, and Section 28 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882.115. The Local Taxation Returns Acts, which require the clerk, or other officer, of every authority to furnish annually to the Minister of Health a return of the authority&apos;s receipts and expendi-ture, do not apply to county councils or borough councils, these being dealt with under Section 28 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 18S2, as applied to county councils by Section 75 of the Local Government Act, 18SS. Broadly speaking, the authorities to whom the Acts apply are all bodies or persons having power to levy, or to precept for the levying of, any compulsory rate, tax, toll or due, other than those raised for the public revenue. It will be seen, therefore, that the Acts extend to such bodies as Burial Boards, Harbour Authorities, Port Sanitary Authorities, Catchment Boards and Drainage Boards, River Conservators, the Receiver of the Metropolitan Police, and many other authorities, some of which, e.g., the Receiver of the Metropolitan Police and the Metropolitan
Water Board, have functions both within and without the county of London, and are not &quot; local authorities &quot; for the purposes of the draft Bill.116. As in the case of the Audit provisions to which we have referred in paragraphs 112 and 113 above, the choice lies between consolidating the provisions relating to local financial returns in a separate Act applicable to the whole country, or inserting them in the draft Bill and extending tho Part of the Bill which comprises them to local authorities in London and to certain bodies which are not local authorities. In our opinion it would be a pity not to include this small branch of the local government law in the general statute, and we have accordingly, for reasons of general con-venience, adopted the latter alternative in the draft Bill.PART XII.BYELAWS.117. There are two principal codes of procedure for making byelaws, that contained in Sections 182 to 188 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and that contained in Section 23 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882. The code of 1S75 regulates byelaws made by sanitary authorities under the Public Health Acts and, in addition, it applies to byelaws made under the following Acts :  The Markets and Pairs Clauses Act, 1S47 ; the Town Police Clauses Act, 1847 ; the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1SS5 ; the Museums and Gymnasiums Act, 1S91 ; the Commons Act, 1S99 ; the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901; the Public Libraries Act, 1901; the Open Spaces Act, 1906 (other than byelaws made by a county council) ; the Housing Act, 1925. and the Nursing Homes Registration Act, 1927. Section 23 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1SS2, empowers the council of a borough to make byelaws for the good rule and government of the borough and for the pre-vention and suppression of nuisances other than those punishable summarily by virtue of other Acts in force tlnoughout the borough. Section 16 of the Local Government Act, 1888, extends this power to county councils as regards all parts of the county other than boroughs.118. The most important distinction between the codes of 1S75 and 18S2 is thai byelaws under the former code are submitted for confirmation to the Minister of Health, whereas those under the latter code must be sent to the Secretary of State and may, within forty days, be disallowed by His Majesty in Council. Section 1S7 of the Public Health Act, 1S75, created an exception to this rule by providing that byelaws made by the council of a borough under Section 90 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835 (which was reproduced in Section 23 of the Act of 1S82) &quot; for the prevention and suppression of certain nuisances &quot; should not be required to
be sent to the Secretary of State but should be subject to the pro-cedure of the public health code. This exception was expressly prescrved by Section 23 (6) of the Act of 1882, but the section pro-cecded &quot; nothing in the Public Health Act, 1875, shall be con-strued as having restricted the meaning or scope of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835, or as restricting the meaning or scope of this section with respect to prevention or suppression of nuisances.&quot;The precise effect of the inter-action on each other of Section 187 of the Act of 1875 and Section 23 (6) of the Act of 1SS2 is by no means clear, nor is it practicable to draw any clean distinction between byclaws for good rule and government and b3relaws for the prevention and suppression of nuisances, since many byelaws would probably fall within the scope of either expression. Wo understand that in practico the Home Office and the Ministry of Health have not found difficulty in deciding what class of byelaw is appropriate to each Department, and in order to remove any doubts as to jurisdiction we have provided in the draft Bill that the Secretary of State is to deal with b3&apos;elaws made by county and borough councils for good rule and government and for the prevention and suppression of nuisances, except those dealing with matters of public health or other matters which, in the opinion of the two Departments, would more appropriately be dealt with by the Minister of Health.119. We feel no doubt that, subject to preserving the juris-diction of the two Departments, there should be a single code of procedure for making byelaws, and this is provided in the draft Bill. The code will apply to all byelaws which are at present made under the Public Health Act, 1875, Section 23 of the Municipal Corpora -tions Act, 1882, and Acts, whether public or local, which incor-porate or apply either of those codes. It will not affect statutes which contain their own byelaw-making codes.120. The procedure which we propose follows generally the lines of that of the Act of 1875, and in particular departs from those of the Act of 1882-(a) by not requiring a two-thirds majority of members of the council to be present at the meeting at which byelaws are made ;(6) by substituting an obligation to deposit the proposed byelaws for inspection for the obligation to affix them to the county or town hall;(c) by requiring the byelaws to be confirmed by the Secre-tary of State or Minister of Health in place of the procedure under which they are liable to be disallowed by His Majesty in Council.121. The Royal Commission on Local Government considered the position of urban and rural district councils in connection with
byclaws for good rule and government and recommended (para-grapli 66 of their Final Report) that these councils should have  (a) the right to appeal to the Secretary of State against a refusal on the part of the county council to make such byelaws ;and(6) concurrent power to enforce such byelaws when made.We have considered the first of these recommendations as too important an alteration to include in the draft Bill. The second recommendation is, however, in a different category and the draft Bill gives effect to it.PART XIII.PROMOTION OF, AND OPPOSITION TO, BILLS IN PARLIAMENT.Existing Provisions.122. The principal enactments are the Borough Funds Acts of 1872 and 1903, Section 15 of the Local Government Act, 188S, Section 1 of the County Councils (Bills in Parliament) Act, 1903, Section 3 of the Local Government (County Boroughs and Adjust-ments) Act, 1926, and Section 55 of the Local Government Act, 1929. The consolidation of the law on this subject presents one difficulty. The Borough Funds Acts of 1872 and 1903 are drafted in terms of conferring a power to cliarge the expenses of promoting and opposing local and personal Bills on the borough fund, and it was held in the case of A. G. v. Mayor of Brecon, (1878) 10 Ch. D. 204, that a municipal corporation has a right to defray out of the borough fund the expenses of meeting an attack made by a Bill in Parliament on its existence as a corporation or on its property, rights or privileges. On the other hand, Section 15 of the Local Government Act, 1888, which extended the Act of 1872 to county councils, is drafted in terms of a power &quot; of opposing Bills in Par-liament,&quot; not a power of charging the expenses of opposition on the county fund, and similar language is used in Section 1 of the County Councils (Bills in Parbament) Act, 1903, and again in Section 55 of the Local Government Act, 1929, which confers on rural district councils powers &quot; of promoting and opposing Bills in Parbament.&quot; To preserve this distinction between the language of the Acts relating to borough and urban district councils on the one hand and to county and rural district councils on the other would much complicate the drafting of this Part of the Bill. This Part of the Bill is accordingly drafted in terms of empowering local authorities, other than parish councils, to promote or oppose local or personal Bills in Parliament, but with a saving for any existing rights under the general law.
134123. Under Section 4 of the Act of 1872 it is necessary for the council, both as regards promotion of a Bill and opposition to a Bill-(a) to secure a resolution of an absolute majority of the -whole number of members of the council, after publishing a special notice of the meeting by advertisement in a local newspaper;(6) to publish by advertisement in a local newspaper two notices that the resolution has been passed ; and(c) to obtain the approval of the Minister of Health.We recommend that in the case of opposition to a Bill it should not be necessary to obtain the approval of the Minister or to publish notice of the resolution. Thus, the only special requirement in the case of opposition to a Bill will be that the resolution to oppose must be passed by a majority of the whole number of members of the council, and that special notice of the meeting must be given.124. In paragraph 273 of the Report of the Committee on Local Expenditure attention is called to the expense involved in long newspaper advertisements. In this connection we have con-sidered whether the requirement that the special meeting of the council (and, in the case of promotions, the further meeting of the council) must be advertised should be reproduced in the draft Bill. Under the draft Bill, as under the existing law, a resolution to promote a Bill must be advertised, and persons interested thus have an opportunity of laying objections before the Minister of Health when the question of approving the resolution is under consideration. In our opinion this advertisement, coupled with the notices required by the Standing Orders of Parliament, would afford ample pubbcity, and we think that in the interests of economy advertisement of the meetings might well be dispensed with, but the matter hardly falls within our Terms of Reference, and accordingly in this matter we have reproduced the existing law.125. The amalgamation of rates and funds effected by the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, has rendered unnecessary such provisions as those of Section 2 of the Borough Funds Act, 1S72, empowering the local authority to determine to which rate or fund and in what proportions costs are to be charged. The only case in which any question of apportionment could arise in a borough or urban district is where the borough or district has been divided for some public health purpose under Section 211 (4) of the public Health Act, 1875, and the expenses of promoting or opposing a Bill related solely or principally to one part of the area. It is not clear whether the language of Section 2 of the Act of 1872 would cover a case of this kind, and instances in which an apportionment of these expenses ought to be made are likely to be so rare that we have not thought
it necessary to provide for the case in the draft BUI. The position in the case of rural district councils is discussed in the Notes on Clauses.126. Section 10 of the Act of 1872, as amended by Section 3 (2) of the Local Government (County Boroughs and Adjustments) Act, 1926, provides that the earlier Act is not to extend to appli-cations for Bills, other than Bills having for their object the extension of a county borough, if the object of the BiU would be attainable by a Provisional Order. Parliament has never observed this provision with any degree of strictness, and we have thought it unnecessary to reproduce it in the draft BUI.Borough Funds Act, 1903.127. The Royal Commission on Local Government, after hearing much evidence on the subject, recommended that the provisions of the Borough Funds Act, 1903, with regard to meetings of electors and poUs should be repealed (Final Report, paragraph 186). This recommendation, if adopted, would have the effect of assimUating the law relating to borough and urban district councils to that relating to county and rural district councils, and would effect a substantial simplification. The Committee, however, came to the conclusion that the repeal without re-enactment of these provisions involved a somewhat important point of principle and was not within their Terms of Reference, and accordingly the existing law is reproduced, though the Committee are in favour of the Royal Commission^ recommendation.PART XIV.FREEMEN.128. The provisions relating to freemen of municipal boroughs are contained in Part X. of the Municipal Corporations Act, 18S2, and the Honorary Freedom of Boroughs Act, 18S5. The provisions in the Act of 1882 contain a number of savings of rights existing immediately before the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1S35. We should have been glad to have avoided the drafting of fresh legislation by reference to a state of things now almost one hundred years past, but consideration of the subject has convinced us that if a precise definition of the various privUeges of freemen in the pre-1835 boroughs was thought impracticable in 18S2 it is doubly so now, and that as this branch of the law is relatively unimportant the most convenient course is to re-enact it sub-stantially as it stands.
13PART XV.GENERAL PROVISIONS. Contracts.129. The chief matter under this head to which wo need refer is Section 174 of the Public Health Act, 1875. This section provides a crucial instance of the difficulty of enacting a single code applicable to all types of local authorities acting in all their various capacities without effecting substantial alterations in the law.Section 174 applies to borough and urban district councils acting under the Public Health Acts. The section as enacted has no application to county, rural district, or parish councils, nor to urban authorities when discharging functions other than those of public health, but by enactments reproduced in Section 57 (3) of the Housing Act, 1925, it was extended to the exercise by urban authorities of the power of providing houses for the working classes. Provisions of a similar kind are to be found in a number of other Acts, mostly enacted before the middle of the last century, eg., Section 57 of the Lighting and Watching Act, 1833, Section 20 of the Baths and Washhouses Act, 1846, and Section 31 of the Burial Act, 1852.The provisions of Section 174 may be summarised as follows :  (a) contracts exceeding  50 must be under seal; (6) contracts must specify materials, price, time of perform-ance and penalty;(c) in the case of a contract for works, an estimate from the surveyor of the probable expense and a report as to best mode of contracting, must be obtained ;(d) in the case of contracts of  100 or upwards, public notice must be given, tenders must be invited, and security for due performance of the contract taken ;(e) contracts are to bind the successors to the parties, but the authority is to have power to compound.The section has been the subject of a large number of judicial decisions, and it has been held that paragraph (a) is mandatory, i.e.., that a breach of the requirement vitiates the contract, but that paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) are directory only. A considerable amount of judicial comment on paragraph (a) has been devoted to expressing regret that the law should permit a local authority to take advantage of their own neglect in not sealing the contract.130. Three courses presented themselves to us : (a) to reproduce the section with its present limitations ; (6) to extend it to all types of authorities in whatever capacity they are acting;
(c) to repeal it without re-enactment, thus assimilating the position of urban authorities when exercising public health or housing powers to that of county, rural district and parish councils, and to that of the urban authorities themselves when acting, e.g., as local education authorities. We feel no doubt that the first course is undesirable.   To re-enact a code which applies only to one type of authority acting in a particular capacity is not only logically indefensible  but has the practical effect of setting traps for contractors and other members of the public with whom local authorities deal.The second course is impracticable. Those of our members who represent local authorities which are not at present subject to the provisions of Section 174 made it clear that those authorities would strongly resent the imposition of this code, and in view of the difficulties to which it has given rise in practice, the impossibility of arriving at monetary limits appropriate to all cases, and the comments which paragraph (a) of the section has provoked from the judicial bench and elsewhere, we are clear that Parbament should not be invited to extend it.There remains the third course and this we have after much consideration adopted. In doing so we have been influenced by the fact that the law on the subject of contracts entered into by corporations is now much better settled and understood than in 1875. In particular, the judgments of the Court of Appeal in the case of Lawford v. Billericay Rural District Council (1903) 1 K.B. 772, reviewed and disposed of a long series of conflicting decisions, and the matter is to some extent dealt with in Section 74 of the Law of Property Act, 1925. The need for a special provision on the fines of Section 174 (1) has, therefore, in our opinion largely disappeared. We recommend, however, that the Bill should contain a provision requiring every contract made by a local authority to be made in accordance with their standing orders, and requiring every local authority to make standing orders regulating the cases in which public notice of the proposed contract is to be given or tenders in-invited. We anticipate that if such a provision is accepted by Parlia-ment the Ministry of Health will issue one or more sets of model standing orders for the guidance of the smaller authorities, and we see no reason to doubt that with this assistance local authorities will furnish themselves with suitable codes. Under the Clause inserted in the draft Bill contractors are not to be prejudicially affected by the failure of the local authority to comply with their standing orders.Power to accept Gifts of Land and Personal Properly. 131. Under Section 8 (1) (A) of the Local Government Act, 1894, a parish council has power to accept and hold gifts of property, real or personal, for the benefit of the inhabitants of the parish or any part thereof.   Under Section 14 of the same Act, trustees of
property held in trust for the benefit of the inhabitants of a rural parish or for public purposes, other than ecclesiastical purposes, connected with such a parish may, with the approval of the Charity Commissioners, transfer the property to the parish council.Under Section 114 of the Housing Act, 1925, local authorities may accept donations of land or money for the purposes of that Act. Apart from this provision, local authorities, other than parish councils, have no express power under the general law to accept gifts, whether of land or money. It is competent, however, for the Minister of Health to make Orders under Section 33 of the Local Government Act, 1S94, conferring on borough and urban district councils the powers of parish councils under Section 8 (1) (h) of that Act, and many such Orders have been made.It has long been felt to be anomalous that in this respect parish councils should have wider powers than those of other authorities, and applications to Parliament for local Act powers to accept gifts have been frequent. In connection with a Bill promoted by a municipal corporation in 1927, the Minister of Health was invited by the Local Legislation Committee to prepare, in consultation with the Charity Commissioners, a model clause for the purpose. This was done and the clause has since been inserted in a number of local Acts. We are satisfied that a pro-vision on these lines might now with advantage form part of the general law, and the necessary clause has been inserted in the draft Bill. It follows substantially the language of the local Act clause, but extends the exception for ecclesiastical charities which that clause provides to eleemosynary charities, that is, charities which distribute money or other benefits to individuals. We take the view, which we understand to be that of the Charity Com-missioners, that local authorities are not suitable trustees of gifts of property to be devoted to objects of this latter kind.Transfer of powers of Government Departments to Local Authorities.132. A portion of Section 10 of the Local Government Act, 1888, providing for the transfer by provisional orders of the powers of commissioners of sewers, conservators and similar bodies to county and county borough councils, is reproduced in the draft Bill.The remainder of the section, which was amended by the Local Government (Transfer of Powers) Act, 1903, provides a similar power for the transfer to county and county borough councils of powers of Government Departments. The Bill for the Act of 1SS8 as introduced proposed to transfer direct a number of these powers but the proposal met with opposition and was withdrawn and replaced by Section 10. In 18S9 a provisional order was made under the Act for the purpose of effecting a transfer of a number of these powers, but the transfer was opposed and the Select Committee to whom the Bill for the confirmation of the order was referred reported that questions of policy beyond their terms of reference
were involved and the order was allowed to lapse. In 1897 a further order was made and embodied in a Bill, but again, in face of objections, the Bill was withdrawn. No further orders have been made. In the circumstances we have thought it right to treat this part of the section as dead, and it is accordingly repealed without re-enactment.CONCLUSION.133. The foregoing paragraphs deal with the major points on which, for the reasons indicated, we recommend that the law should be amended. The Notes on Clauses, which appear in the Appendix, deal with a number of minor amendments which we recommend, and to which effect is given in the draft Bill.134. At a very early stage in the proceedings of the Committee our Secretary, Mr. It. S. King-Farlow, found it necessary to relinquished-quish his duties, and his place was taken by the Assistant Secretary, Mr. G. J. Cole. We desire to speak in the highest terms of the services which Mr. Cole has rendered us. He has played a large part both in the preparation of the Notes and Memoranda on which the draft Bill is founded and in our work generally, and his remarkable knowledge of Local Government law has made his services invalu-able, the more so as he possesses in a notable degree the gift of being able to produce his knowledge at a moment&apos;s notice whenever required for the assistance of the Committee.We are, Sir,Your obedient Servants,CHELMSFORD, Chairman.L.

137APPENDIX.NOTES ON CLAUSES. Part I.CONSTITUTION AND ELECTIONS.Clause I. This Clause sots out tho six main administrative areas which at present exist for the purposes of local government, viz.: counties, county boroughs, non-county boroughs, urban districts, rural districts and parishes. For tho reasons sot out in paragraph 15 of tho Report, the Clause has been drafted so as to distinguish botweon boroughs and other urban districts.Clause 3. Section 2 (5) (6) of tho Local Govornmont Act, 18S8, provides that tho chairman of a county council before acting as a justico shall &quot; if ho has not already dono so &quot; take tho oaths required by law to be taken by n justice of tho peaco. This provision has given riso to difficulty, and in particular doubts havo been oxpressod whether a chairman who had taken tho necessary oaths on being appointed chairman of tho council on some previous occasion is required to tako tho oaths again. Subsection (5) of the Clause is intended to mako it clear that tho necessary oaths must be taken in every cose, except whero the chairman is at the time of accepting office as chairman a justico of the peace for tho county and as such has already takon the necessary oaths.Clause 5. Section 2 (6) of the Local Government Act, 1888, provides that tho vice-chairman of a county council shall hold office &quot; during tho term of office of tho chairman.&quot; Tho subsection docs not make tho position of tho vice-chairman clear in a case where a casual vacancy in tho office of chairman occurs during the courso of the year. The Clause therefore provides that the vice-chairman is to continue in office until tho new chair-man is elected at the next annual meeting of the council.Clause 6. Section 14 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, which is applied to county aldermen by Section 75 of the Local Government Act, 1SS8, provides that the number of aldermen &quot; shall be one-third of the number of councillors.&quot; The number of county councillors for a county is not always exactly divisible by three, and tho Clause accordingly provides that in such a case the number of aldermen shall be one-third of the highest number below the actual number of councillors which is divisible by three. There are, however, a few county councils where the number of county aldermen exceeds one-third of the number of county councillors, and in order to conform with the provisions of the Clause it will be necessary to reduce the number of county aldermen in these cases by one. As it is not desired to affect the tenure of office of any existing alderman, the proviso to subsection (2) provides that any necessary reduction in tho number of aldermen shall not take effect until the ordinary election of aldermen held either next or next but one after the commencement of the Act as tho Secretary of State may direct.Section 14 (6) of the Act of 1882 provides for tho retirement of aldermen &quot; on the ordinary day of election of aldermen.&quot; We understand that in -ome areas these words have been interpreted as meaning that the aldermen &apos;Tase to be aldermen at the first moment of the day of election, whilst in other areas they have been interpreted as meaning that the aldermen cease to bo aldermen as soon as the new aldermen are elected. Section 61 (3) of the Act of 1882, which was repealed in 1910, provided that outgoing aldermen might vote at the election of mayor, and it appears to be reasonably clear, therefore, that in 1882 the Legislature contemplated that the retiring50S8 0
aldermen would still bo aldermen at tho timo of tho election of tho mayor, which immediately precodes the election of tho now aldermen. Subsection (4) of the Clauso accordingly provides that tho aldermen shall continue in office until &quot; immediately after tho election &quot; of tho new aldormun.Clause 7. Section 60 (4) of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, pro-vides that at an election of aldermen tho persons voting aro personally to hand their votes to tho chairman of tho meeting. Wo understand that in practico tho votes aro collected by tho clerk of tho council or his deputy and handed ovor to tho chairman. Wo have accordingly omitted tho word &quot; personally &quot; in Clauso 7 (3).After tho election of aldermen tho voting papers are required to be handed over to the clerk of the council and kept for twolvo months. For reasons explained in tho Note on paragraph 43 of Part III of the Second Schedule wo havo substituted six months for twelve months in subsection (4) of tliis Clause.Clause 9. Section 1 (1) of the County Councils (Elections) Act, 1891, provides that tho ordinary day of election of county councillors shall be such day &quot; between tho first and eighth day of March as the county council may fix, and if no date is so fixed shall be the eighth day of March.&quot; We under-stand that there is some doubt whether it is possible under this provision to hold the election on tho first day of March. In order to clear up thin doubt tho Clause provides that the day fixed for the election shall bo not earlier than tho first and not later than tho eighth day of Maroh.Clause 11. TJndor Section 64 (1) of tho Local Government Act, 188S. as amended by Section 2 of tho Representation of the People Act, 1922. upon a representation being made by the council of a county or borough that the alteration of any electoral division of a county or of tho number of county councillors and electoral divisions in a county is desirable, the Secretary of State may (in certain cases after holding a local inquiry) make an order for the proposal contained in the representation or for such other proposal as ho may deem expedient, or may refuse to make an order. The Royal Commission on Local Government recommended that &quot; there should be an express enactment to the effect that the Council of any County District within a County who are aggrieved by a refusal of the County Council to make a representation to tho Secretary of State in favour of an alteration of tho boundary of any Electoral Division of the County or of the number of County Councillors and Electoral Divisions, or are dissatisfied with any altera-tion proposed by the County Council, shall havo a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, who shall if either party so requests hold an inquiry and may make an Order under section 54 of the Act of 18S8 &quot; (Final Report, para. 278). Subsection (2) of the Clause gives effect to this recommendation so far as it relates to a refusal or neglect on the part of the county council to make a representation. The right of the council of a county district who are dissatisfied with a representation to appeal is in effect provided by the existing law (reproduced in Subsections (4) and (5) of the Clause) which enables the council to present a petition, and the Secretary of State, on consideration of the petition, to make such order as he thinks fit.Since the Act of 1922 provides that an order may be made without a local inquiry being held if no petition against the proposal is made by a local authority concerned, or by a specified number of local government electors, we have provided in subsections (3) and (4) for copies of the representation being supplied to all authorities concerned, for the publication of local advertisements indicating where a copy of the representation may be in-inspected, and for objections to the representation being made to the Seoretary of State.Clause 14. Section 75 of tho Local Government Act, 1888, provides for the appointment by the county council of a returning officer at eleotion*
of county councillors, and for tho appointmont by tho returning officer of deputies to act on his bohalf. No provision is made to meot tho case where the person appointed to bo tho returning officer is at tho time of an election unablo to act owing to death, illness or absence. Tho point has been mot in subsection (1) of this Clauso by providing that in such an event tho chair-man of tho county council shall appoint another porson to bo tho county returning officer at that election. This provision is analogous to Section 67 (2) of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1882 (reproduced in Clauso 28), under which, in tho event of tho incapacity of an aldorman to act as returning officor at a ward election, tho mayor may appoint another porson to act in his place By Section 3 of the County Councils (Elections) Act, 1891, tho mayor of a non-county borough is tho returning officer at an olection of a county councillor for an electoral division co-oxtensivo with or wholly comprised within tho borough, and if tho mayor is incapablo of acting, an aldorman chosen by tho council of the borough is to act as returning officor. As tho matter is likoly to bo ono of urgency wo think that provision should be mado lor somo person automatically taking tho place of tho mayor as returning officor in tho event of his incapacity. We understand that it is the usual practice for mayors to appoint deputies under Section 16 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, and accordingly subsection (3) of the Clause pro-vidos that tho deputy mayor shall bo the porson to tako the placo of tho mayor. It will thus bo necessary to call tho council together to olect an alderman for the purpose, only in tho raro cases where no deputy mayor lias been appointed, or the mayor and deputy mayor are both doad, absent or incapacitated.Clause 10. Section 75 (18) of the Local Government Act, 188S, provides that the costs of an election of a county councillor are not to &quot; exceed those allowed by Part I of tho First Schedule to tho Parliamentary Elections (returning Officors) Act, 1875, as amended by the Parliamentary Elections (returning Officers) Act, 1SS5, or by such scale as tho county council may from time to time frame.&quot; The scale of costs laid down in the Act of 1875, as amended by the Act of 1885, is now out of date and was repealed in 1918 so far as parliamentary elections aro concerned. Tho Clauso accordingly provides for a scale of costs being framed by the county council in all cases.Section 75 of the Act of 1888 also applied to county council elections the provisions of Sections 4 to 7 of the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers) Act, 1875, relating to the taxation by the county court of the return -ing officer&apos;s bill of costs. We understand that such taxations ore very rare, and as the bill of costs is in all casos subject to the scrutiny of tho district auditor Section 75 (19) of the Act of 188S has not been reproduced.Clause 17. Subsection (3) of this Clause is based on Section 1 of the Mort-main and Charitable Uses Amendment Act, 1892, which provides that Section 6 of tho Mortmain and Charitable Uses Act, 1888 (which exempted from tho provisions of that Act assurances of land for certain public purposes), shall apply to any assurance by deed of land to a local authority for statutory purposes. In many cases a power to hold land without licence in mortmain is conferred on municipal corporations by their chartors, and we appreciate that in such cases tho provisions of tho subsection will overlap with the provisions of the charter. As, however, somo charters are defective in tiiis respect, we think it convenient that the power to hold land without licence in mortmain should be conferred by the Bill on municipal corporations cenerally.Clause 18. Tho provisions reproduced in subsections (7) and (8) of this Clause have been amended on the same lines as those reproduced in Clause 3 (5).Subsection (9) of the Clause reproduces Section 155 (2) of the Aot of 1882, with the omission of the words &quot; at which he is present by virtue of his5088 C2
office of mayor.&quot; Those words havo given rise to difficulties in determining whether a mayor present at meetings of committees of justices (o.g. Licensing Committees) is present by virtue of his office of mayor or by virtue of his appointment on the committee. Wo think it right that tho mayor should preside over any meeting at which he is present, and the omission of the words referred to will secure this.Clause 20. Section 16 of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, provides for the appointment of a deputy mayor to act as such &quot; during tho illness or absence of tho mayor.&quot; In order to bring this provision more into accord with tho corresponding provisions applicable to the vice-chairman of a county or district council, this Clause provides for the deputy mayor holding office &quot; until a nowly-eleotod mayor becomes entitled to act as mayor.&quot;Clauses 21 and 22. The provisions reproduced in these Clauses havo been amended in the same manner as those reproduced in Clauses 6 and 7.Clause 23. The Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, does not expressly state on what date newly-elected councillors enter into office, and in this respect differs from the corresponding provisions applicable to other typos of councillors. The words &quot; and their places shall be filled by the newly, elected councillors who shall come into office on that day &quot; havo therefore boon added at the end of subsection (2) of this Clause, in order to secure uniformity.Clause 25. The present procedure for dividing a borough into wards, or altering the number or boundaries of wards, or the number of councillors, will be found in Section 30 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, Sections 2 and 3 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1893, and Sections 1 and 3 of the Borough Councillors (Alteration of Numbers) Act, 1925.In our opinion the procedure under these enactments is unsatisfactory in the following respects : (a) tho number of wards into which the borough is to bo divided, or the number of councillors to be elected for the borough, is fixed by Order in Council, which is made before the appointment of the Com-missioner upon whom devolves the duty of settling the boundaries of the proposed wards and fixing the number of councillors for each ward, and no machinery appears to be afforded to the Privy Council for ob-taining the information which is necessary for the purpose of arriving at a decision as to what should be the proper number of wards or coun-cillors ;(6) a scheme of the Commissioner which does not meet with the approval of His Majesty in Council, and which indeed may be found to be quite impracticable, nevertheless governs municipal elections until a substituted scheme has been approved by Order in Council.In order to eliminate these features, and with a view to bringing the pro-cedure into closer accord with present day practice, the Clause provides that :-(o) tho petition is to be accompanied by a detailed statement, prepared by the council, of proposals designed to give effect to the petition;(6) notice that tho petition has been presented and that a copy of the petition and of the accompanying proposals may be inspected at a specified place is to be published in one or more local newspapers;(c) except where the petition prays only for an alteration of the number of councillors for a borough not divided into wards, or it appears to His Majesty in Council that the petition is one which should not be entertained, the petition is to stand referred to the Secretary of State, who is required to appoint a Commissioner to prepare a scheme after holding a local inquiry on the proposals ; .   .
(d) the schomo prepared by the Commissioner is to be sont to tho Secretary of State for submission to His Majesty in Council, and a copy sont to tho town clerk;(e) His Majesty in Council may approve tho scheme, with or without modifications, or rojoct the scheme ;(/) the scheme is not to come into operation until approved by Order in Council.Under tho oxisting law there is no provision allowing a fresh oloction of the whole of tho council to bo held as a consequonco of an alteration or redistribution of wards. In somo cases a general election is desirablo, and in ono instanco tho council of a borough obtained a local Act for a re-distribution of tho wards of the borough in ordor to secure authority for tho holding of a gonoral oloction of councillors. It appears to us that such a power would bo very useful in the case of a general redistribution of wards, and tho Clause accordingly provides that His Majesty in Council may pro-vide, on an alteration of tho wards of a borough, for a fresh election of tho council being hold in any caso whoro the council petition for such an election.Section 30 (10) of the Aot of 1882 provides that in fixing the number of councillors to bo elected for each ward tho Commissioner is to have regard &quot; as well to tho number of persons rated in the ward as to tho aggregate rating of the ward.&quot; For the reasons indicatod in the Note on Clause 38, rateable value is no longer a suitable test, and wo have accordingly substituted in subsection (5) of this Clauso for tho words quoted above tho words &quot; to the number of local government electors for the ward and to the net annual value of the land in the ward as at the last preceding 31st day of March.&quot; The expression &quot; net annual value &quot; is defined in Clauso 209 as meaning the net annual value for Income Tax (Schedule A) purposes, or in relation to land which does not fall within Schedule A, tho net annual value thereof for rating purposes.Section 3 of the Act of 1893 provides that where an Order in Council has been made providing for the division of a borough into wards or the alteration of the number or boundaries thereof, or the alteration of tho number of councillors, a second petition may not be presented before tho expiration of seven years. Whilst we appreciate that it is undesirable to alter the wards of a borough at frequent intervals a provision of this character is, in our opinion, to be deprecated as occasionally preventing a desirable change from being effected, e.g., the distribution of the total number of electors among the wards may be seriously affected by the development of a new housing estate. Moreover, there is no similar bar in respect of the alteration of electoral divisions for county council elections, or of the wards of districts or parishes for tho election of district councillors, and there seems to be no valid reason for a distinction in this respect. Section 3 of the Act of 1893 has accordingly not been reproduced.Clause 28. For the reasons set out in the Note to Clause 14 this Clause provides for the deputy mayor acting as returning officer in the absence or incapacity of the mayor.Our attention was drawn to cases in which difficulties had arisen in appointing aldermen to be returning officers at ward elections owing to the number of aldermen in office on the day on which the appointment is made being less than the number of wards. In order to meet this difficulty we have provided in subsection (2) that in such cases a councillor may be appointed as returning officer provided that he is not a councillor or a local government elector for the ward.Clause 32. We have omitted from the provisions reproduced in sub-section (2) the words &quot;or if there is any doubt as to the latter name, of such namo as the county counoil direct &quot; as being unnecessary.   Whilst5088 cs
such a provision may havo been necessary in 1894 when rural districts were first formed, there can bo no doubt at this date as to tho name of a rural district.Clause 33. Every local authority may elect a mayor or chairman from outside the members of the local authority but, except in the case of urban district councils, any person so elected must have the qualifications necessary for election as a momber of tho local authority. There appears to be no reason for distinguishing urban district councils from other local authori-ties in this respect, and wo havo accordingly provided in subsection (1) of this Clauso that any person elected chairman of an urban district council from outside tho members of tho council must bo a person qualified to be elected as a member of the council.Subsection (2), which provides that tho election of tho chairman is to be the first business transacted at the annual meeting of the council, is now as regards district councils, but assimilates tho law to that applicable to county, borough and parish councils, and is in accordance with existing practice.As regards the term of offico of chairmen of local authorities, tho chairman of a county council, the mayor of a borough, and the chairman of a parish council, although elected annually, continue in offico until their successors havo been elected and accepted office. There is no similar provision in the case of the chairmen of district councils, and accordingly there is frequently a gap between the date on which tho chairman of a district council goes out of office and that on which his successor is elected. In order to meet this difficulty subsection (3) provides that the chairman of a district council shall continue in office until his successor becomes entitled to act as chairman.Clause 34. The provisions reproduced in this Clause have been amended in a similar manner to those reproduced in Clause 5.Clause 35. Section 23 (6) of the Local Government Act, 1894, provides that a county council may, on request made by a resolution of an urban district council, passed by two-thirds of the members voting on the resolution, direct that the members of such council shall retire together on the fifteenth day of April in every third year. By Section 14 (1) of the Poor Law Act, 1927, which is made applicable to rural district councils by Section 24 (4) of the Act of 1894, where the county council, on the application of a rural district council, consider that it would be expedient to provide for the simultaneous retirement of the whole of the members of that council, they may give a similar direction. In this case, however, there is no requirement of a two-thirds majority. There seems no reason for mamtaining a dis-tinction between urban and rural district councils in this respect, and sub-section (3) accordingly requires a two-thirds majority in both cases.Clause 37. Under Section 57 of the Local Government Act, 18S8, as amended by Section 4S of the Local Government Act, 1929, a county council may, after holding a local inquiry and giving certain notices, make an order for dividing on xirban district into wards, altering the number and boundaries of wards, or altering the number of councillors. When the order has been made, notice of its provisions must be given, and copies supplied, in the pre-scribed manner, and the order comes into operation &quot; on being finally approved by the county council.&quot;Tliis procedure is not a convenient one, as any amendment of the original proposals involves a fresh commencement of the proceedings. Aecordingly the Clause provides that: (a) after the necessary notices havo been given and local inquiryheld, the county council, if satisfied that tho proposed alterations are desirable, may prepare a draft order, of which notice is to be given andoopies supplied in the prescribed manner;(6) a period of six weeks is to be allowed after publication of thedraft order for the making of objections;
(c) after tho expiration of this period, and after consideration of any representations mado, an order may bo made in tho torms of tho original draft, with or without modifications, to tako effect as from a dato specified in tho order. Clause 3S.   Rural district councillors aro ordinarily elected for each parish in tho rural district, but under Section GO of tho Local Governmont Act, 1894, which applies a provision now reproduced in Section 10 of the Poor Law Act, 1927, a county council may : (a) divido a parish into wards and dotormino tho numbor of coun-cillors to bo elected for each ward &quot; having due regard to tho net annual value of tho property therein according to tho valuation list for tho time being in forco &quot; ; or(6) add a parish to an adjoining parish &quot; being a parish the population of which, according to tho last census for tho timo boing, docs not oxcoed three hundred, and the net annual valuo of tho property in which does not exceed tho averago not annual valuo of the property in tho parishes of the district.&quot;Tho derating provisions of tho Local Government Act, 1929, have ren-dered any comparison of parishes based on tho net annual valuo of tho property thorein inappropriate, as agricultural land no longer has any &quot;&apos;not annual value &quot; and will not appear in any futuro valuation list. Wo have accordingly omitted tho words quoted in paragraph (a) above, leaving tho division of parishes into wards to tho unfettered discretion of tho county council. A similar repeal in paragraph (6) above, dealing with the union of parishes, is, howovor, in our opinion undesirable, since it would not be satisfactory to leave tho relative population of tho two parishes as tho sole criterion. For tho purposes of that paragraph, therefore, we havo sub-stituted the net annual value of tho land in tho parish for Income Tax (Sche-dule A.) purposes for the net annual value thereof for rating purposes in tho case of land which falls within Schedule A.Wo understand that some doubt is felt whether imdor tho existing law more than two parishes can bo united for the purpose of tho election of rural district councillors, and in order to remove this doubt, subsection (2) of the Clause makes it clear that any number of parishes may be so united.Clause 40. In tho case of district and parish councils, elections are governed by rules made by tho Secretary of State trader Section 48 of the Local Governmont Act, 1S94. Subsection (4) of that section enacts that the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act, 18S2, with respect to &quot; the acceptance of office, resignation, ro-eligibility of holders of offices and the filling of casual vacancies &quot; are to apply to district councillors subject to such &quot; adaptations, alterations, or exceptions &quot; as may be made by the election rules. It has been represented to us that these subjects are not really germane to rules dealing with elections, and wo find that in fact the alterations made by the rules to the provisions of the Act of 1882 are very slight. We are satisfied, therefore, that so far as regards these matters the rule-making power is not strictly necessary, and accordingly we have in-eorporated in the draft Bill the provisions of the Act of 1882 as modified by the existing rules.Clause 43. Section 1 of the Local Government Act, 1894, established a parish council for every rural parish (i.e., a parish in a rural district) which had a population of three hundred or more at tho census of 1891, and further provided that if the parish meeting of a rural parish with a population at that census of under three hundred so resolved, the county council wore to establish a parish council for the parish if the population was ono hundred or more, and might do so at their discretion if the population was under ono hundred. Under Section 38 (4) of the Act the parish meeting for a rural parish with a population of under two hundred at the census of 1891 were5088 0*
given power to apply to tho county council for a parish council, but no similar power was given to a parish with a population between two hundred and three hundred.There appears to bo no justification at tho present time for allowing the question whether tho establishment of a parish council should bo com-pulsory or optional to depend on the census of 1891, and the Clause accordingly provides that (a) every rural parish which has a population of three hundred or over according to tho last published census for tho timo being shall have a parish council ;(6) in tho case of a rural parish which has a population of over two hundred but undor throo hundred according to tho last published census, the county council shall, at tho request of tho parish meeting, establish a parish council ; and(c) in tho case of a rural parish wliich has a population of under two hundred according to tho last published census, the county council may, if they think fit, but only at tho request of tho parish meeting, establish a parish council.Clause 47. Sub-section (2) slightly extends the existing law by applying to the parish meeting of a parish which has a parish council the provisions of Section 19 (11) of tho Act of 1894 relating to the signing and sealing of documents. At present these provisions only apply to parishes which have no separate parish council.Clause 48. Section 3 (9) of tho Local Government Act, 1S94, provided that any act of a parish council &quot; may bo signified by an instrument executed at a meeting of the council, and under the hands or, if an instrument under seal is required, under the hands and seals, of tho chairman presiding at the meeting and two other members of the council.&quot; We understand that it is not always convenient for instruments of this nature to be executed at a meeting of the council, and there is no similar requirement in the case of other local authorities. The Clause therefore provides that such instruments may be executed at any time by any two members of the council.Clause 49. Tho provisions reproduced in Subsection (5) have been amended in a similar manner to those reproduced in Clause 5.For the reasons set out in the note to Clauso 33, Sub-section (7) of this Clause provides that the chairman of a parish meeting shall continue in office tintil his successor is elected.Clause 54.   See note on Clause 40.Part II.GENERAL PROVISIONS AS TO MEMBERS AND MEETINGS   of LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND ELECTIONS.Clause 57. As regards members of district and parish councils this Clause reproduces the existing law. As regards county and borough councils, the Clause assimilates the law to that applicable to district councils (o) by making it clear that the candidate must bo of full age and a British subject, and (6) by making the status of local government elector a qualification both for becoming and remaining a member of the council where that is the sole qualification.Clause 59. Paragraph (c) of Sub-section (1) provides that (subject to the exceptions mentioned in proviso (iv) to the Clause) poor relief received within twelve months before the day of election or since the election is to disqualify from membership of local authorities of all types.   Under the
existing law this disqualification attaches to membership of county councils, county borough counoils, district councils and parish counoils, but not to membership of non-county borough councils. There appears to be no good reason for maintaining this distinction.Paragraph (e) substantially reproduces Section 46 (1) (c) of tho Local Government Aot, 1894, whioh applies to district and parish councils. There is no similar provision applicable to county and borough councils, but under Section 2 of the Forfeiture Aot, 1870, a momber of such a council who is con-victed of treason or felony, and sontencod to death or to ponal servitude or to a term of imprisonment with hard labour oxcoeding twelve months, would vacate hi3 office. Tho paragraph applios the provisions of the Act of 1894 to local authorities of all types. It differs, however, from tho provisions of tho Act of 1894 in throe minor respects (i) The words &quot; in the United Kingdom &quot; are inserted to romovo a doubt whether the Act of 1894 applied to persons convicted outside the United Kingdom ;(ii) Tho reference in the Act of 1894 to imprisonment &quot; with hard labour &quot; is*no longer appropriate, since at tho present day, in determining whether a person should serve a term of imprisonment with hard labour, tho nature of the crime is only ono amongst a number of considerations of which account is taken. Accordingly, imprisonment &quot; for not loss than three months without the option of a fine &quot; has been substituted ;(iii) Tho words in the Act of 1894, &quot; and has not received a free pardon,&apos;&apos; have been omitted as unnecessary; see Hay v. Tower Justices (1890 ) 24 Q.B.D. 561.Proviso (ii) to the Clause reduces to a single codo the over-lapping provi-sions of Section 39 of the Act of 1882, Section 32 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883 (as amended by Section 9 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1890), and Section 46 (4) of the Local Government Act, 1894. The proviso is based on the principle, which appeara to underlie the existing law, that a bankrupt becomes immediately requalified for membership of a local authority if the bankruptcy is annulled or he is discharged for reasons honourable to himself, but that in other cases there is to be a probationary period of five years from the date of discharge. The same principle is adopted in proviso (iii) as regards persons who make compositions with their creditors.Sub-section (2) is designed to meet such cases as those of officers in the Public Assistance service who act under the direction of Guardians Com-mittees. These Committees, which are technically sub-committees of the Public Assistance Committee of the county council, comprise members nominated by the councils of the various county districts in the area over wliich they operate. The intention of the sub-section is to prevent officers of the county council who are employed under the direction of the Committeo [e.g., the clerk of the committee, or a relieving officer) from being eligible for membership of any of the councils nominating members of the Committee.Clause 61. Tho periods allowed under the existing law for acceptance of office is three months in the case of county councils, five days in the case of borough counoils and one month in the case of district councils. There appears to be no good reason for maintaining these distinctions, and sub-section (1) of this Clause substitutes a period of two months in all cases.In the case of county councils, the declaration may be made before two members of the council, the clerk of the council, a justice of the peace, or a commissioner for oaths. In the case of borough councils, the declaration may be made before either two members of the counoil or the town clerk. In the case of district councils, the declaration may be made before two members of the council, the clerk of the council, or, if the declarant is abroad, before a British Consul.   Here again there appears to be no good reason for
maintaining these distinctions, and accordingly sub-section (2) provides that for all councils tho declaration may bo made boforo either (a) two members of tho local authority ;(b) the clerk of tho authority ;(c) a justice of the peace or a magistrate in any part of His Majo8ty&apos;s dominions ;(d) a commissioner for oaths ; or(e) a British Consul.The Clause also amends the law in requiring the chairman of a district council or of a parish council to mako a declaration of acceptance of office, notwithstanding that ho may already have mado a declaration on acceptance of office as councillor. In this respect tho Clauso assimilates the law to that applicablo to the chairman of a county council and to tho mayor of a borough.Clause 62.   Seo paragraph 39 of the Report.Clause 63. Under tho existing law members of county and borough councils become disqualified for membership if absent from the county or borough for specified periods (Section 39 of the Act of 1882 ; Section 75 (14) of the Act of 1888). Under Section 46 (6) of the Act of 1894, tho test in the case of members of district and parish councils is absence from meetings of the council, and an exception is made in the case of absence due to illness or other reason approved by the council. Tho period of absence is twelve mcnths in tho case of county councils, and six montlis in other cases. The Clause has been prepared on the principlo that the test should in all cases bo absence from meetings of the council and not absence from the area, except in the case of the mayor of&quot; a borough who, as chief magistrate of the borough, should be required to be present in the borough. A uniform period of six months has been adopted as regards absence from meetings. As regards the mayor of a borough the existing law is reproduced.Proviso (a) is a new provision allowing attendances at meetings of com-mittees, sub-committees and joint boards to rank as attendances at meetings of tho council for the purposes of the Clause.Proviso (6) reproduces the Members of Local Authorities Relief Act, 1900, but extends that Act to members of the Naval Reserve, the Air Force Reserve and the Auxiliary Air Force. During the late War the Act of 1900 was temporarily extended to cover all members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces (see the Local Authorities (Disqualification Relief) Act, 1914).Clauses 64 and 65. The existing provisions relating to the date on which casual vacancies occur are very involved. By Section 36 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1SS2, where a member of a borough council resigns his office the council are required forthwith to &quot; declare tho office to be vacant, and signify tho same by notice in writing, signed by three members of the council and countersigned by the town clerk, and fixed on the town hall, and the office shall thereupon become vacatit.&quot; These provisions also apply to county councils and urban district councils. It has been held under this section (see R. v. Mayor of Wigan (1885) 14 Q.B.D. 908, and Pease v. Loivden (1899) 1 Q.B. 3S6) that although the act of resignation is complete as soon as the necessary notice has been given and the fine paid, so that tho person resigning cannot act in tho office thereafter, the office itself does not become vacant, and an election to fill the vacancy cannot be held, until tho council have in fact declared the office to be vacant.By Section 39 of the Act of 18S2,if a member of the council of a county or borough is declared bankrupt, or compounds by deed with his creditors, or makes an arrangement or composition with his creditors, or is absent from tho county or borough for a cortain period, ho immediately becomes dis-qualified and ceases to hold tho offico ; thereupon the council must forthwith declare the office to be vacant as in the case of a resignation of office.   It is
not clear, howover, whether this section still applies in the case of bankruptcy having regard to tho provisions of Section 32 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883.No similar declaration is required in tho case of a disqualification arising under Section 12 of tho Act of 1882, e.g., on account of a mombor of a county or borough council boing interested in a contract with tho council. Indeed, it appears from certain cases, o.g., Lewis v. Carr (1876) 1 Ex.D. 484, and Cox v. Truscott, 42 L.T. 560, that the effect of Section 12 may bo merely to disqualify tho member from acting as such while the disqualification lasts, and not to vacate tho office.Section 46 (7) of tho Local Government Act, 1894, provides that where a member of a district or parish council becomes disqualified for holding office or vacates his seat by absence, the council shall forthwith declare the office to be vacant, and signify the same by notice signed by three members and countersigned by tho clork, and that tho office shall thereupon become vacant.In our opinion thero should bo a uniform codo applicable to all local authorities, and a declaration by tho council should only be required in those cases in which thoro may bo room for doubt whether a vacancy has in fact arisen. Clauses 64 and 65 have accordingly been framed on these linos, and provide at what date a casual vacancy shall be deemed to havo occurred in each of the ovonts mentioned.Clause 66. Sub-section (1) of this Clauso reproduces parts of Sections 40 and 66 of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, so far as they apply to tho offices of chairman of a county council, mayor, or alderman. The Clauso provides, howover, that the vacancy must bo filled &quot; not later than tho next ordinary meeting of the council,&quot; or, if that mooting is hold within fourteen days after the vacany arises, then &quot; not lator than tho next following ordinary meeting of tho council,&quot; instead of within &quot; fourteen days after notice in writing of the vacancy has been given &quot; as under the existing law. Tho object of this amendment is to obviate the necessity of calling a special meeting of the council for the purpose of filling tho vacancy. Many county councils only meet at quarterly intervals, and the present period of fourteen days often requires tho summoning of a special meeting for tho purpose. The Clauso also extends the provision to tho chairman of a district or parish council.Section 66 (2) of the Act of 1882 provides that, where tho office vacant is that of mayor, the notice of meeting for tho election shall be signed by the town clerk. This provision also applies to a vacancy in tho office of chairman of a county council,and has reference to the requirement in the Second Sohedule-to the Act of 18S2, that notice of a meeting-must be signed by tho mayor, or chairman of the county council. A meeting of a county council or of the council of a borough can, however, be convened only by tho chairman, or mayor, or by fivo members of tho council after a requisition to that effect has been sent to tho chairman, or mayor. It is open to doubt, therefore, whether an effective meeting of tho council can be called when the office of chairman, or mayor, is vacant, and wo have accordingly provided in this Clause for the clerk convening the meeting to fill the vacancy in such circumstances.Clause 67. A casual vacancy occurring among the members of a borough council is required to bo filled within fourteen days after notice of the vacancy has been given to tho mayor or town clerk by two local government electors, and this provision applies also in the case of county councils, but in the case of county councillors a casual vacancy which occurs within six months before the date of retirement of councillors cannot be filled until the ordinary election takes place.In the cose of district councils, the vacancy must be filled within one month after the notice of the vacancy has been given by two councillors, but a vacancy occurring within six months before tho day on which the councillor
-whoso scat is vacated would have retired in the normal course cannot bo filled until the ordinary election.The Royal Commission on Local Governmont recommended that tho period within which a casual vacancy should be filled in tho case of county and borough councils should be extended to one month (see paragraph 285 of their Final Report), and having regard to the recommendation contained in paragraph 26 of our Report, we have provided in sub-section (1) of this Clauso a period of thirty days instead of the periods of fourteen day3 and ono month already referred to, as the period within which casual vacancies must be filled. In cases where a declaration is required to create a casual vacancy, the period of thirty days will run from the date of tho declaration ; in other cases tho period will run, as at present, from tho date on which notice of tho vacancy is given by two local government electors.Sub-section (3) assimilates the provisions applying to borough councils to those which apply to county and district councils by providing that a casual vacancy occurring within six months of tho day on which the councillor in question would ordinarily have retired shall not be filled until the ordinary day of election, and shall then be filled as an ordinary vacancy, tho person elected having tho usual term of office. An exception has been inserted to meet the case where the number of persons disqualified at any ono time exceeds one-third of the whole number of members of tho council. This provision is based on Section 1 (2) (o) of the Audit (Local Authorities) Act. 1927.A further amendment has been made in tho provisions reproduced in sub-sections (4) and (5) by substituting a &quot; determination by lot &quot; for a &quot; deter -mination by the council.&quot; Under sub-section (7) tho lots are to be drawn at a meeting of the council under tho direction of the ohairman of the meeting.Clause 69.   See paragraph 30 of the Report.Clause 70. The words &quot; and that the non-compliance or mistake did not affect the result of the election &quot; are taken from Section 13 of the Ballot-Act, 1872.Clause 71. Having regard to the recommendations contained in para-graphs 55 to 57 of the Report, we have omitted the words &quot; or by informa-tion in the nature of a quo warranto &quot; from the provisions reproduced in subsection (1) of this Clause. The Clause has also been extended to district and parish council elections.Clause 72. By Section 70 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, if a municipal election (i.e., an election to the office of mayor, alderman, councillor or elective auditor) is not held on the appointed day or within the appointed time, or on the day next after that day or the expiration of that time, or becomes void, the High Court, on motion, may order an election to be held on a day appointed by the Court. This provision is applied to county council elections by the Act of 1888. In the case of district and parish councils, if an election fails or becomes void, the county council may fix a new date for the election under the Local Government (Elections) Act. 1S96.The Royal Commission on Local Government recommended that where a by-election of a borough or county councillor was rendered void the town or county council should be empowered to order a now election (see Final Report, paragraph 286). It appears from the Report that the Royal Com-mission had their attention called to a case in which an election had failed by reason of the absence of a valid nomination, and although their recom-mendation is in general terms it is not clear whether they had specifically in mind a case in which an election is rendered void by some failure on the part of the person responsible for the conduct of the election to conduct the election in accordance with the terms of the statute.   To suggest that in
1H O 3Dsuch a caso thoro should bo power for tho council to order a now election without recourse to tho Court is, in our opinion, going too far, sinco in effect it would onablo tho responsible officer and the council to disregard the pro-visions of tho Statute. Wo think, theroforo, that the proposals of tho Royal Commission should bo limited to cases in which an oloction is rendered void by tho death of a candidate, or ineffective through tho absenco of the necessary number of nominations, and that tho mayor or county returning officor should have tho powor to order a now election to bo held on a date to bo fixed by him in every case, whother of a by-election or a general election, in which thoro is not a sufficient number of candidates or retiring councillors to fill the vacancies. Subsections (1) and (2) of tho Clause havo been framed accordingly.Subsection (4) reproduces Section 1 of the Local Government (Elections) Act, 1800, so far as it relates to district councils, but limits tho powers of tho county council to that of ordering a new election of district councillors to bo held. As regards parish councils tho section is reproduced in full in Clause 55 (1), and its wide powers are still, in our opinion, necessary in the case of parish councils in order to enable county councils to deal expeditiously and inexpensively with small irregularities of proceduro connected with tho election of these councils. District councils have, however, since the Act of 1896 become so permanent and important a feature of local government that we doubt whether the summary power of the county council to &quot; do anything which appears to them necessary or expedient&quot; is at the present time either necessary or desirable. In the comparatively rare cases in which irregularities occur we think that a fresh election should be held.Clattse 74. Subsection (1) provides that ballot boxes, fittings, etc., provided for parliamentary elections out of moneys provided by Parliament, may be lent for use at local governmont elections on conditions to be deter-mined by the Treasury. Section 48 (6) of the Local Government Act, 1894, provides that ballot boxes, fittings, etc., provided by, or belonging to, a &quot;public authority&quot; for elections, whether parliamentary or other, shall be lent for use at local government elections on terms to be prescribed, and either free of charge or, except in prescribed cases, for charges to be pre-scribed. No conditions or &quot; cases &quot; have in fact ever been prescribed under this subsection. We understand that since the Representation of the People Act, 1918, the practice has been for the Treasury to provide ballot boxes and other fittings for use at parliamentary elections, and for these to be lent free of charge for use at local government elections on condition that any damage or wear and tear is made good, and that the boxes, etc., are stored locally free of charge. Whether the term &quot; public authority &quot; in the Act of 1894 is wide enough to cover the Treasury is open to doubt, seeing that it is only in consequence of the passing of the Representation of the People Act, 1918, that the Treasury have provided ballot boxes, etc. There can, however, be no question that the loan of these fittings for local government purposes is convenient and economical. The subsection accordingly reproduces the existing practice.Clause 75. The proviso to this Clause is based on the provisions of Section 35 (6) of the Local Government Act, 1888. That subsection, however, is restricted to boroughs having a separate quarter sessions and a population of ten thousand or more at tho Census of 1881. There appears to be no good reason why the disqualification should be so restricted and especially why it should depend on the population of the area in 1881, and the proviso is accordingly drafted to apply to any area in the county.Clause 76.   See paragraph 49 of the Report.Clause 77. Section 45 of the Local Government Act, 1894, provides that the chairman of a parish council, if present at a parish meeting and not a candidate for election thereat, shall be tho chairman of the meeting.   We
such a caso there should bo powor for the council to ordor a now election without recourso to the Court is, in our opinion, going too far, since in effect it would enable the responsible officer and tho council to disregard tho pro-visions of the Statute. We think, therefore, that the proposals of tho Royal Commission should bo limited to cases in which an election is rendered void by tho death of a candidate, or ineffective through tho absence of the necessary number of nominations, and that the mayor or county returning officor should havo tho powor to ordor a now elootion to be held on a date to bo fixed by him in every caso, whothor of a by-olection or agoneral election, in which thoro is not a sufficient number of candidates or retiring councillors to fill the vacancies. Subsections (1) and (2) of tho Clause havo been framod accordingly.Subsection (4) roproduces Section 1 of the Local Government (Elections) Act, 1890, so far as it relates to district councils, but limits the powers of tho county council to that of ordering a new election of district councillors to bo held. As regards parish councils tho section is reproduced in full in Clauso 55 (1), and its wide powers are still, in our opinion, necessary in tho case of parish councils in order to enable county councils to deal expeditiously and inexpensively with small irregularities of procedure connected with tho election of these councils. District coimcils have, however, since the Act of 1896 become so permanent and important a feature of local government that we doubt whether the summary power of tho county council to &quot; do anything which appears to them nocessary or expedient &quot; is at the present time either necessary or dosirable. In the comparatively rare cases in which irregularities occur we think that a fresh election should be held.Clause 74. Subsection (1) provides that ballot boxes, fittings, etc., provided for parliamentary elections out of moneys provided by Parliament, may be lent for use at local government elections on conditions to be deter-mined by tho Treasury. Section 48 (6) of the Local Government Act, 1894, provides that ballot boxes, fittings, etc., provided by, or belonging to, a &quot; public authority &quot; for olections, whether parliamentary or other, shall be lent for use at local government elections on terms to be prescribed, and either free of charge or, except in prescribed cases, for charges to be pre-scribed. No conditions or &quot; cases &quot; have in fact ever been prescribed under this subsection. We understand that since the Representation of the People Act, 1918, tho practice has been for the Treasury to provide ballot boxes and other fittings for use at parliamentary elections, and for these to be lent free of charge for use at local government elections on condition that any damage or wear and tear is made good, and that the boxes, etc., are stored locally free of charge. Whether the term &quot; public authority &quot; in the Act of 1894 is wide enough to cover the Treasury is open to doubt, seeing that it is only in consequence of the passing of the Representation of the People Act, 1918, that the Treasury have provided ballot boxes, etc. There can, however, be no question that the loon of these fittings for local government purposes is convenient and economical. The subsection accordingly reproduces the existing practice.Clause 75. The proviso to this Clause is based on the provisions of Section 35 (6) of the Local Government Act, 1888. That subsection, however, is restricted to boroughs having a separate quarter sessions and a population of ten thousand or more at the Census of 1881. There appears to be no good reason why the disqualification should be so restricted and especially why it should depend on the population of the area in 1881, and the proviso is accordingly drafted to apply to any area in the county.Clause 76.   See paragraph 49 of the Report.Clause 77. Section 45 of the Local Government Act, 1894, provides that the chairman of a parish council, if present at a parish meeting and not a candidate for election thereat, shall be the chairman of the meeting.   We
understand, howovor, that, the Local Government Board wore advised that a chairman of a parish council who is not a local government elector of tho parish is debarred from attending a parish meeting by virtue of Soction 2 of the Act, and accordingly that ho cannot preside thereat. Having regard to the fact that decisions of tho parish council may bo under review at a parish meeting, wo aro of opinion that tho chairman of the council should have the right to attend parish meetings whether or not ho is an olector for tho parish, but that if ho is not such an elector he should not have an original vote theroat.   Subsection (2) of this Clauso has boon insortcd accordingly.Clause 79. This Clauso reproduces Section 75 of tho Municipal Cor-porations Act, 1882, as extended to county council olections by Section 75 of tho Local Government Act, 1888, and to district and parish council elcc-tions by Section 48 (3) of tho Local Government Act, 1894. The section as it stands is not very apt in its application to parish council elections, which take placo at parish meetings. In tho circumstances wo have in-sorted the words &quot; or if a porson whoso duty it is to convono a parish meeting for the election of parish councillors neglects or refuses to convono tho meet-ing.&quot; Wo have also substituted summary proceedings for a High Court action as tho moans for recovering the penalty referred to in tho Clauso.Clause 80. This Clause reproduces Section 74 of tho Municipal Corpora-tions Act, 1882, but summary proceedings have been substituted for pro-ceedings on indictment, and a penalty of  20 as an alternative to a term of six months imprisonment has been inserted.Clause 81. Section 3 of tho Ballot Act, 1872, which is reproduced in this Clause, provides that an offender who is a returning officer, or polling officer, or clerk, is to bo liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, whilo the maximum term for other offenders is six months. The distinction between tho two classes of persons is retained in tho Clause, but in regard to tho latter class summary proceedings aro allowed as an alternative to procedure by indictment.Clause 82. Under Section 6 (2) of tho Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act, 1883, the maximum penalty for the offence of personation at olections is two years&apos; imprisonment. The Clause modifies this by providing summary pro-cedure as an alternative to procedure by indictment, and limiting the maxi-mum penalty in that case to six months&apos; imprisonment or a fine of  20. It has been represented to us that tho gravity of these offences varies within wide limits, and that under the existing law cases in which a moderate penalty might appropriately be inflicted by a court of summary jurisdiction escape, for the reason that the facts of the case do not warrant proceedings by way of indictment.Clause S4.   See paragraphs 55 to 57 of the Report.Part III-COMMITTEES AND JOINT COMMITTEES. Clause S5.   Seo paragraph G4 of the Report.Clause 87. Rural district councils are empowered by Section 202 of the Public Health Act, 1875, at a meeting specially convened for the purpose, to form a parochial committee for any contributory place* within thoir district.* Ordinarily each parish witliin a rural district is a contributory place, but about forty special drainage districts exist in England and Wales. The majority of theso districts consist of a part of a single rural parish, but in somo instances the special drainage district consists of parts of two or more rural parishes. Every special drainage district is a contributory place, and tho remainder of each parish into which the special drainage district extends also becomes a contributory place see Section 229 of the Public Health Act, 1S75.
Tho parochial committeo is subject to uny restrictions or regulations imposed upon it by tho council. Tho Royal Commission on Local Govornmont recommended in thoir Final Roport, paras. 235 and 236, that &quot; a Parish Council or Parish Mooting should be ompoworod to appeal to tho County Council against a refusal by tho Rural District Council to create a Parochial Committee, and that tho County Coimcil should bo ompoworod, if thoy think fit, to direct tho District Council to create such a committee.&quot; They further recommond that &quot; facilities should bo provided for tho creation, where do-sired, of a Parochial Committeo for two or moro parishes or contributory places. This Clauso gives effect to tho above recommendations of tho Royal Commission.Clause 90. Section 19 (3) of tho Local Govornmont Act, 1894, ompowers a parish mooting (which comprises all tho local government oloctors of the parish) to appoint a committeo &quot; of their own number &quot; for any purposes which, in tho opinion of tho parish meeting, would bo better rogulatod and managed by moans of such a committeo. It is not clear whothor tho words &quot; of their own number &quot; rofor to all tho local government electors of the parish, or only to thoso electors who are present at tho meeting at which tho committoo is appointed. In ordor to remove this doubt tho words &quot; from amongst tho local government electors for tho parish &quot; havo been substituted for tho words &quot; of their own number.&quot;Clause 91.   Seo paragraph 6S of the Report.Clause 94. The Royal Commission on Local Government drew attention to the position of co-opted members on Committees of Local Authorities, and recommended that &quot; any disqualifications applicable to elected members should apply also to co-opted members &quot; (Final Roport, para. 342). The Clauso gives effect to this recommendation, but the two exceptions provided for in tho Education Act, 1921, and tho Mental Deficiency Act, 1913, are safeguarded by the proviso. Having regard to the provision of Section 3 of the Public Libraries Act, 1919, which enables an Education Committee to act as tho Public Libraries Committeo, wo have extended tho exceptions to committees appointed under the Public Libraries Acts.Part IV. OFFICERS;Clause 97. Some of the local government statutes require a person appointed as an officer to bo a &quot; fit person &quot; (o.g., Municipal Corporations Act, 18S2, Section 17 (1)), or a &quot; fit and proper person &quot; (Public Health Act, 1875, Section 189) ; others contain no such requirement (e.g., Local Govern-ment (Clerks) Acts, 1931, Section 1). To secure uniformity the Bill provides in every case that the person appointed is to be a &quot; fit person.&quot;Clause 9S. Tho local government statutes contain a variety of ex-pressions with regard to remuneration of officers; e.g., Public Health Act, 1875, Section 189. &quot;such reasonable salaries wages or allowances as the urban authority may think proper &quot; ; Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, Section 20, &quot; such remuneration as they [tho borough council] think reasonable&quot;: Local Government (Clerks) Act, 1931, Section 8 (1), &quot;such salary as may from time to time be determined by the county council.&quot; Throughout this Part of tho Bill tho terms &quot; reasonable salary &quot; or &quot; reason-able remuneration &quot; alono have been used, the latter term being used where it is intended to cover payments either by way of salary or by way of fees.Clause 99. Subsection (5) of this Clause reproduces so much of Section 11 of tho Local Government (Clerks) Act, 1931, as relates to clerks of county councils. Subsections (2), (3) and (5) of Section 11, which provide for the Minister of Health stating a Cose for the opinion of tho High Court on points
soof law, have been omitted on the ground that tho only part of tho Ministor&apos;s jurisdiction which is reproduced in tho Bill rolates to questions of fact, viz., the state of health of the clerk, which can hardly give rise to a point of law.Clause 101. Tho existing law applicable to the appointment of a county treasurer depends upon whether tho county council have resolved to apply the provisions of Section 18 of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, as they are empoworod to do by Section 75 (16) (e) of the Local Government Act, 1888. If they have not so resolved, tho provisions of tho County Rates Acts of 1738 and 1815 relating  to the appointment of county treasurers apply. Tho only distinction between the two codes is that under the pro-visions of the Act of 1882 tho person appointed must not bo a member of the council, and any vacancy in the office must be filled within twenty-one days. The number of county councils which have resolved to adopt thoso provisions is not known. The Clauso reproduces tho provisions of Section 18 of tho Act of 1882 (with the substitution of &quot; four months &quot; for &quot; twenty-ono days &quot; as the period within which a new treasurer must be appointed) and extends those provisions to all county councils. Subsection (4), wliich reproduces Section 18 (4) of the Act of 1882, has been extended to cover partners and employees, in order to assimilate the law to that applicable to the clerks and treasurers of district councils.Clause 103. Section 3 (x) of the Local Government Act, 1888, trans-ferred to county councils the powers of quarter sessions relating to &quot; the appointment, removal and determination of salary of the county surveyor.&quot; The term &quot; county surveyor &quot; presumably refers to the surveyor appointed by the justices under the Statute of Bridges (22 Hen. 8, c. 5) for the repair of public bridges. The Clause provides in terms for the appointment of a county surveyor, to hold office at the pleasure of the council, and with such duties as may be determined by the county council.Clause 105. As regards subsection (4), see paragraph 76 of the Report. As regards subsection (5), see Note on Clause 101 (4). Subsection (6) is a new provision, and represents an extension of Section 8 of tho Local Govem-ment (Clerks) Act, 1931 (reproduced in Clause 104 (3)), to officers of borough councils.Clause 106. Under the existing law there is no express provision requir-ing a rural district council to appoint a clerk or treasurer, but Section 190 of the Public Health Act, 1875, requires a rural district council to appoint such officers and servants as are necessary for the purposes of that Act. Under present conditions it is essential that every rural district council should have a clerk and treasurer, and the Clause provides accordingly. As regards subsection (3), see paragraph 76 of tho Report.Clause 108. For the reasons explained in tho Note to Clause 112, we have extended the provisions of proviso (i) to this Clause to a failure on the part of the district medical officer of health to give to the county medical officer of health any information which he is required to give.Clause 109.   See paragraphs 71 and 72 of the Report.Clause 111. Section 286 of the Public Health Act, 1875, which is re-produced in thi3 Clause, allowed a poor law medical officer to be appointed an assistant to the medical officer of health of the combined districts. We understand that this power has not been exercised, and it has accordingly beon omitted from the Clause. It is in any event open to doubt whether any expross power to make such an appointment is necessary.In order to assimilate the provisions reproduced in the Clause to provisions of the kind usually appearing in modern legislation we have substituted in tho proviso to subsection (1) a reference to a district with a population of 20,000 for a reference to a district with a population of 25,000.
-    145Part V.OFFICES AND BUILDINGS. Clause 123.   See paragraph 83 of the Report.Clause 125. Section 8 of the Local Government Act, 1894, empowers a parish council &quot; to provide or acquire buildings for public offices and for meetings and for any purposes connected with parish business or with the powers or duties of the parish council or parish meeting &quot; and also &quot; to contribute towards the expense of doing any of the things above mentioned, or to agree or combine with any other parish council to do or contribute towards the expense of doing any of the things above mentioned.&quot; It is not certain whether under this section a parish council could contribute towards the expense of providing a building suitable for meetings incurred, not by another parish council, but by some other body or person. The Clause is drafted so as to make it clear that this can be done. Parish councils will thus be enabled to contribute towards the expenses incurred by such bodies as the British Legion in providing village halls. In this connection attention is drawn to paragraph 212 of the Final Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government.Clause 112. Section 69 (4) of tho Housing, Town Plunning, otc, Act, 1909, provides that a medical officer of heal th who fails to give tho infor-mation required to bo given under the section shall bo liable on summary conviction to a fino not exceeding  10. No corresponding penalties are provided for other broaches of duty on tho part of a medical officer of health, and wo consider that disciplinary action would be a more appropriate remedy, and havo accordingly omitted subsection (4) from tho Clause. As, however, a failure to give such information affects the county council, we havo, as explained in the Note to Clause 108, made it a ground upon which tho county coimcil contribution towards tho officers salary will bo liable to bo forfeited.Clause 114 and 115.   See paragraphs 74 and 75 of the Roport.Clause 116.   See paragraph 76 of tho Roport.Clause 117. This Clauso is intended to give effect to the general principle discussed in paragraph 70 of tho Report. It loaves unaffected tho appoint-mont and tenuro of offlco of officors appointed under the Poor Law and Education Acts, and of specially designated officers under other enactments. It further provides that specially designated officors are not to be appointed under tho Bill. The Clauso, howover, does not prevent the appointment under tho Bill of officors who are not specially designated, such as clerks or porters, moroly because the duties of such officors are concerned with the work (say) of the education committee.Clause 118.   See paragraph 81 of tho Report.ClauscllQ. As in tho case of the requirement to give security (Clause 11S), the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1875, as regards accountability are limited to officers appointed under that Act, but in the case of officers of county and borough councils the requirement is of general application (Section 21 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882). For the reasons in-dicated in paragraph 81 of the Roport, the Clause has been drafted so as to cover all officers of tho various types of local authorities under whatever Act appointed.Clause 120.   See paragraph 73 of the Report.Clause 121.   See paragraph 82 of the Report.
Part VI.ALTERATION OF AREAS.Clause 127. Under tho existing law new borouglis aro created by chartor upon tho petition of inhabitant householders. Tho Royal Commission on Local Government recommended that &quot; in lieu of a potition signed by a majority of tho inhabitant householders, the potition should bo mado by tho Local Authority &quot; on a rosolution being passed by &quot; an absolute majority of the wholo number of tho Council at a special mooting convoned after duo notice,&quot; and &quot; confirmed at a further special meeting, again by an absolute majority&quot; (Final Report, para. 271 (2) ). Tho Clause gives effect to this recommendation.Clause 128. Wo understand that some doubt oxists whether under the existing law a chartor can bo amended by a later charter. In order to remove those doubts the words &quot; and every petition for tho amendment of a charter of incorporation &quot; havo been inserted in subsection (1) of this Clauso.Under the existing law there is no express authority for the holding of a local inquiry on tho receipt of a petition for incorporation. In order to remedy this defect, and having regard to the recommendation mado by tho Royal Commission on Local Government in paragraph 271 (3) of their Final Report, a provision has been insorted in subsection (2) empoworini.1 tho Minister of Health to hold an inquiry, if so requested by the Privy Council.Clause 130. Paragraplis (2) and (3) of the Seventh Schedule to tho Muni -cipal Corporations Act, 1882, provide that a draft scheme shall be published, and that the Committeo of Council shall take into consideration any objections made thereto boforo settling the scheme. In order to bring this procedure more into accord with modern practice, and to avoid unnecessary oxponso. subsection (2) of the Clause provides that a notice shall be published stating that a draft scheme has been prepared, that a copy thereof is open to in-spection at a specified place, and that representations with respect thereto may be made to the Committee of Council within one month after publication of the notice. Similarly, in subsection (3) a provision requiring the publica-tion of a notice stating that a copy of the settled schemo can bo inspected at a specified place, has been substituted for publication of the whole scheme. These amendments are in accord with the recommendation mado in para-graph 273 of the Roport of the Committee on Local Expenditure.In subsection (4) &quot; one-twentieth of the local government electors for the area&quot; havo been substituted for &quot; one-twentieth of the owners and ratepayers of the borough &quot; (see paragraph 69 of the Report).Clause 133. By Section 213 (4) of the Municipal Corporations Act, 18S2. a scheme which is opposed requires confirmation by Parliament, but an unopposed schemo may be confirmed either by Parliament or by Order in Council. Section 218 (2) of the Act, which deals with amending schemes, provides that tho amending scheme may be confirmed by Order in Council if the original scheme was confirmed by Order in Council. Tho position may, therefore, arise whoro an unopposed scheme which was confirmed by Ordor in Council is sought to be amended by an amending scheme which is opposed. Under the existing law tho amonding scheme, though opposed, may be confirmed by Ordor in Council on tho ground that the original schemo, beine unopposed, was thus confirmed. We doubt whother this was tho intention of the Legislature. In our opinion the question whether an amending scheme should require confirmation by Parliament ought to depend upon whether that scheme is opposed or not. Subsection (2) of the Clauso provides accordingly.
Clause 13S.   Section 54 (1) of the Local Governmont Act, 1888, provides .that a representation may bo made to the Minister of Health by the councilof a county or borough for : (a) tho alteration of tho boundary of any county or borough ; or (6) the union of a county borough with a county ; or(c) tho union of any counties or boroughs, or the division of any county ; or(d) tho alteration of any area of local government partly situate in the county or borough.It is not clear whether under this provision a borough council could petition for an alteration of county boundaries, or a county council could petition for an alteration of tho boundaries of a borough. It is, however, unlikely that this was tho intention of Parliament, and accordingly subsection (1) of the Clause makes it clear that a county council can petition only for alterations affecting tho county area, and that a borough council can petition only for alterations affecting tho area of tho borough.Subsection (2) of Section 54, as originally onncted, provided that &quot; in default of such representation by the council of any county or borough before the first day of November, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine. tho Local Government Board may causo such local inquiry to bo made and thereupon make such order as they may doom expedient.&quot; The words in italics wore repealed, howo%&apos;or, by tho Statute Law Revision Act, 1908, and the effect of the repeal appears to be to give tho Minister of Health, as successor to the Local Government Board, an unlimited power to make a Provisional Order for tho alteration of the boundaries of a county or borough without first receiving a representation to that effect from the county or borough council. It seems clear that the object of the original subsection was to givo these special powers to the Department during the initial period only, and that the subsection as a whole might have been repealed as a matter of statute law revision. We understand that in practice the Minister does not make such orders except on the receipt of representations, and sub-section (2) of Section 54 has, therefore, not boon reproduced.Clause 139. Section 57 (1) of tho Local Government Act, 1SSS, enables the Minister of Health to prescribe the local authorities to whom notice of any inquiry held under the Section is to be given. Under Section 36 (7) of the Local Government Act, 1S94, a parish council, or the parish meeting of a parish not bavins a parish council, are expressly empowered to appear at any local inquiry affecting their parish. In view of the fact that all local authorities concerned, including parish councils and meetings, are given a right of objection, we are satisfied that the prescribing power is unnecessary. Subsection (2) of tho Clause accordingly provides that all these authorities are to receive notice of the inquiry.We have omitted from subsection (2) of the Clause the reference to the Board of Education which appears in Section 57 of the Act of 1SS8 on the ground that educational interests are by no means always affected. Consequently the cases in which the Board should receive notice can more conveniently be prescribed.Subsection (2) of Section 57 of the Act of 188S provides that notice of the provisions of an order made under the section &quot; shall be given and copies thereof supplied in the prescribed manner and otherwise as the county council think fit.&quot; In accordance with modern practice we have substituted in subsection (4) of the Clause a provision requiring the publication of a notice stating that the order has been made, that a copy thereof can be inspected at a specified place, and that representations against the order may be sent to the Minister of Health within six weeks after publication of the notice.Subsection (5) of the Clauso makes some slight changes in the law. Under Section 57 (3) of the Act of 1888 notice of the provisions of the order must
bo given in tho proscribed manner, and if a petition against tho ordor is received from a district council affected thereby, or from not less than one-sixth of tho local government electors in tho district or any ward of the district, tho Minister must hold a local inquiry. If the order relates only to a parish, tho parish council (or, where there is no parish council, tho parish mooting), or not less than one-sixth of the local government electors of the parish, may potition against tho order. Section 36 (7) of the Local Govorn-mont Act, 1894, provides that whore an order for the alteration of tho boundary of a parish, or for dividing a parish, or for uniting it with another parish, is proposod, notice must bo given to tho parish council (or in tho case of a parish without a parish council, to the parish meeting), and that the council or meeting may potition against the order. A rural district is not divided into words, and accordingly tho effect of the provisions referred to above appears to be that where the order proposes to transfer ono or more whole parishes to another rural district (no alteration of parish boundaries or division or union of parishes being involved), the parish council or parish mooting have no right to petition under Section 36 (7) of the Act of 1894. and a petition under Section 57 (3) of the Act of 1888 could be mado only by the rural district council or by one-sixth of the electors of the whole of the rural district.   The subsection amends the law : (a) by enabling the petition to be signed by electors of the parish affected ;(6) by fixing in overy case as a minimum number or proportion &quot; one hundred of tho local government electors of the district, ward or parish or one-third of those electors, whichever i3 the less &quot; for &quot; one-sixth of the electors &quot; ;(c) by enabling a parish council or parish meeting to petition in a case where the parish is to be transferred as a whole to another district, without an alteration of boundaries.Clause 142. By Section 27 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 186S, &quot; every accretion from tho sea, whether natural or artificial, and the part &quot; of the seashore to tho low-water mark, and the bank of every river to the &quot; middle of the stream, which on the twenty-fifth day of December next &quot;(i.e., December, 1868) shall not be included within the boundaries of or &quot; annexed to and incorporated with any parish shall for the same purposes &quot; &quot; (i.e., all civil parochial purposes) be annexed to and incorporated with the &quot; parish to which such accretion, part or bank adjoins, in proportion to &quot; the extent of the common boundary.&quot; Although the section appears to be directed to circumstances existing in 1868 it has been held to apply to accretions formed since that date (Barwick v. South Eastern Railway Com-pany, 1921, 1 K.B. 187). The Clause in the Bill, so far as it relates to accro-tions from the sea and to the seashore, provides that any such area shall also form part of the county district and county or of the county borough in which the parish to which it is annexed is situate, and substitutes the words &quot; for all purposes of local government &quot; for the words &quot; all civil parochial purposes.&quot; The provision in Section 27 of the Act of 1868 relating to the banks of rivers might, wo think, be safely treated as spent, and has not been reproduced.Clause 144. Section 46 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1929, required every county council to review the county and send a report and proposals to the Minister before the 1st April, 1932, or such later date as the Minister might in any case allow. Section 47 of the Act empowers county councils to make subsequent reviews, and obliges them to do so if so required by the Minister, but provides that the intervals between any two reviews is not to be less than ten years. These provisions, except those relating to the first review, are re-enacted in subsections (1) and (8) of this Clause. The words &quot; within such time as the Minister may allow &quot; have been added in subsection (1) in order to make effeotive the default power conferred on the Minister
bo givon in the prescribed manner, and if a petition against tho order is received from a district council affected thereby, or from not less than one-sixth of tho local government olectors in the district or any ward of the district, tho Minister must hold a local inquiry. If the order relates only to a parish, tho parish council (or, whore thoro is no parish council, tho parish mooting), or not less than ono-sixth of the local government electors of the parish, may potition against the order. Section 36 (7) of tho Local Govern-mont Act, 1894, provides that where an order for the alteration of the boundary of a parish, or for dividing a parish, or for uniting it with another parish, is proposod, notice must bo givon to tho parish council (or in tho case of a parish without a parish council, to tho parish mooting), and that the council or meeting may potition against tho order. A rural district is not divided into wards, and accordingly tho effect of the provisions referred to above appears to be that where the order proposes to transfer ono or more whole parishes to another rural district (no alteration of parish boundaries or division or union of parishes being involved), the parish council or parish meeting have no right to petition under Section 36 (7) of the Act of 1894. and a petition under Section 57 (3) of tho Act of 1888 could bo made only by the rural district council or by one-sixth of the electors of the whole of the rural district.   Tho subsection amends the law : (a) by enabling tho petition to be signed by electors of the parish affected ;(6) by fixing in every case as a minimum number or proportion &quot; one hundred of tho local government electors of the district, ward or parish or one-third of those olectors, whichever is the less &quot; for &quot; one-sixth of the electors &quot; ;(c) by enabling a parish council or parish meeting to petition in a case whore the parish is to be transferred as a whole to another district, without an alteration of boundaries.Clause 142. By Section 27 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 186S, &quot; every accretion from tho sea, whether natural or artificial, and tho part &quot; of the seashore to the low-water mark, and the bank of every river to the &quot; middle of the stream, which on the twenty-fifth day of December next &quot; (i.e., December, 1868) shall not be included within the boundaries of or &quot; annexed to and incorporated with any parish shall for the same purposes &quot; &quot; (i.e., all civil parochial purposes) be annexed to and incorporated with the &quot; parish to which such accretion, part or bank adjoins, in proportion to &quot; the extent of the common boundary.&quot; Although the section appears to be directed to circumstances existing in 1868 it has been held to apply to accretions formed since that date (Barwick v. South Eastern Railway Com-pany, 1921, 1 K.B. 187). The Clause in the Bill, so far as it relates to acore-tions from the sea and to the seashore, provides that any such area shall also form part of the county district and county or of the county borough in which the parish to which it is annexed is situate, and substitutes the words &quot; for all purposes of local government &quot; for the words &quot; all civil parochial purposes.&quot; The provision in Section 27 of the Act of 1868 relating to the banks of rivers might, we think, be safely treated as spent, and has not been reproduced.Clause 144. Section 46 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1929, required every county council to review the county and send a report and proposals to the Minister before the 1st April, 1932, or such later date as the Minister might in any case allow. Section 47 of the Aot empowers county councils to make subsequent reviews, and obliges them to do so if so required by the Minister, but provides that the intervals between any two reviews is not to be less than ten years. These provisions, except those relating to the first review, are re-enacted in subsections (1) and (8) of this Clause. The words &quot; within such timo as the Minister may allow &quot; have been added in subsection (1) in order to make effective the default power conferred on the Minister
147by Section 46 (5) of tho Act of 1029, and roproduced in subsection (5) of tho Clauso. In tho caso of tho first roviow, the review had to bo mado before tho 1st April, 1932, or such later date as the Minister may allow. Tho pro-visions relating to tho first roviow wore, by Section 47, applied to subsequent roviows, but as tho date 1st April, 1932, is clearly inapplicable to later reviows it appeared to us that wo wore justified in inserting the words in question.Clause 145. Section 55 of the Local Government Act, 1894, provides that: &quot; (1) Where a parish is divided or unitod or grouped with another parish by an order in pursuance of this Act, each new parish or group so formed shall boar such name as ihe order directs.&quot; (2) Where a parish is divided by this Act, each parish so formed shall boar such name as tho county council direct.&quot; Tho name of a parish may also be altered by an order mado undor the Local Government Acts of 1888 or 1929, for tho division of u parish or tho amalgama-tion of two or more parishes, but there is no provision enabling tho name of a parish to bo altered by desire of tho inhabitants. By Section 3 (9) of the Act of 1894, tho county council are empowered, in any caso of doubt, to direct, after consulting tho parish meeting, what name a parish council are to bear.Subsection (2) of this Clauso onablos tho council of a county borough to alter tho name of a parish situate in the borough, and subsections (3) and (4) enables a county council to altor the namo of a parish on the application of tho parish council or parish meeting, or, in tho caso of a parish in an urban area, on tho application of the council of tho borough or urban district.Clause 148.   See paragraph 88 of the Report.Clause 149. By virtue of subsection (3) of this Clause, the procedure of the Arbitration Act, 1889, will apply to arbitrations under the clauso in lieu of that of the Lands Clauses Acts which were applied by Section 62 of tho Local Government Act, 1888. But in requiring that tho arbitration tribunal shall consist of a single arbitrator the Clause preserves the existing law.Part VII.ACQUISITION OF, AND DEALINGS IN, LAND. Clause 154.   See paragraph 91 of the Report. Clause 155.   See paragraph 93 of the Report.Clause 156. Subsection (1) re-enacts the existing law under which a county council, unlike other local authorities, have power to purchase land compulsorily for any of their functions.Subsection (2), which is strictly speaking a publio health provision, is inserted because Section 176 of the Public Health Act, 1875, contains both the power to purchase land compulsorily and the procedure for the purchase of the land. Tho procedure is replaced by Clause 157 of the Bill, and the most convenient course is to repeal Section 176 in toto. When the public health law is consolidated subsection (2) should be repealed and re-enacted in that code.Clause 157. This Clause takes the place of Section 176 of the Public Health Act, 1875, but the details have been assimilated to the more modern procedure contained in the Housing Act, 1925, the Publio Works Facilities Act, 1930, and other Acts, though, of course, retaining the necessity for confirmation by Parliament. In particular a &quot; request &quot; on the part of the local authority has been substituted for a sealed petition, and the obligation on owners to state whether they assent, dissent or aro neutral to the proposal has been
omitted.   Furthor, tho requirement that notico of the proposal must bo published in Soptomber, October and november and sorved on tho owners, in December, which experience has shown to be hampering and unnecessary has also been omitted.Clauses 158 and 159.   Seo paragraph 92 of tho Roport.Clause ICO. Section 95 of tho Public Hoalth Acts Amondmont Act, 1907. which is in part reproduced in this Clauso, only operates in any particular area when put into force in that area by ordor of tho Minister of Health. Wo understand that orders bringing tho section into operation have been readily granted and there is, in our viow, no reason why tho provision should not be of gonoral application. Tho last paragraph of Section 95 contains a saving for rights acquired under judicial docisions or under agreements boforo the dato on which tho section is brought into operation, and enables disputes-as to rights undor such agreements to be decided by tho Minister. Tho protection of rights undor judicial decisions and under agreements i3 secured by tho Clause. We are informed that, so far as can be traced, no dispute undor the section has over boon referred to the Department, and wo think that if such disputes should ariso they should be determined by the Courts in tho ordinary way.Whore, under an enactment incorporating the Lands Clauses Acts, a local authority acquire land which is subject to a restrictive covenant they aro entitled to uso tho land in breach of the covenant, but are liable under Section 6S of tho Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, to pay compensation to the porson entitled to tho benefit of the covenant. It is not cloar, however, whether compensation would be payable under that section if the land, having been acquired for one purpose, is subsequently appropriated for another, and is then used in breach of tho covenant. It appears to us to bo difficult to justify a provision which would make the right to receive com-pensation depend upon whether the land was acquired for tho purpose for which it is being used, or was appropriated for that purpose from somo other purpose. Subsection (2) accordingly provides that in any case of appropriation compensation shall be payable under Section 68 of tho Act of 1S45, if such compensation would have been payable had the land been originally acquired for the purpose for which it has been appropriated.Subsection (.1) of the Clause is new and fills a small gap in the existing law. If an appropriation of land takes place, it leads to confusion in the accounts of local authorities unless a sum roughly corresponding to the purchase price of the land is credited from one account to another. The subsection, following local Act precedents, enables the Minister to direct the necessary adjustments.Clause 161. This Clause reproduces Section 177 of the Public Health Act, 1S75, which applies to land held by a borough or urban or rural district council, and is extended to county councils by the Local Government Act. 1SSS. The words of the section &quot; as and when they can conveniently spare tho same &quot; in Section 177 have givon rise to doubt as to the length of lease which is permissible, and have for that reason been omitted. Tho Clauso also departs from Section 177 in enabling a lease for a term not exceeding three years to be made without the Ministers consent, the object being to avoid the expense involved in referring matters of relatively small importance to the Department.Clause 162. Subsection (1) of this Clause follows the language of tho Local Government Act, 18SS, in empowering, but not requiring, a local authority to sell land which is not required for the purpose for which it was acquired. Undor Section 175 of tho Public Health Act, 1875, a district council is required to soli land in these circumstances, but the Minister is givon a dispensing power.
Clause 163. With regard to tho proviso to this Clause, soo paragraph 07 of tho Roport.Clause 165. This Clauso reproduces tho substance of Section 9 of tho Local Government Act, 1894, but considerably shortens tho section (which occupies three pages of tho Statute Book) by assimilating tho procedure to that of Clauso 158.Clauses 166 and 167. Section 8 (2) of tho Local Government Act, 1894, which is roproduced in these Clauses, provides that tho powor of lotting for inoro than a year and the powor of sale aro not to bo exercised without the consent of the Minister of Health &quot; in tho caso of property which has been acquired at tho expense of any rato or is at tho passing of this Act applied in aid of any rato or would but for want of income be so applied &quot; ; and that in any other caso tho consent required under tho Charitable Trusts Acts for the sale of charity lands is to ho obtained. This latter consent is that of tho Charity Commissioners, or in tho caso of educational charities tho Board of Education. It would clearly bo unsatisfactory to reproduce ver-batim tho words quoted above, and accordingly in these Clausos wo have followed what wo conceive to have been tho principle of tho section and distinguished between land hold for charitablo purposes and other land.Clause 169.   Subsections (1) and (2) of this Clauso reproduce Soctions 10S(2) and 110 of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1882.   Tho language of parts of Section 108 (2) is almost unintelligible, but tho effect seems to bo that corporate land if it is built on, or is to bo let for building purposes or as accommodation land, may be let for a term of 75 years, and in other cases may bo lot for a term of 31 years.   Wo have thought it bettor to assimilate these poriods to those laid down in the University and College Estates Act, 1925, and accordingly tho Clause provides for the lotting of land :  (a) for 99 years, for building purposes ; (6) for 60 years, for mining purposes ; and (c) for 21 years, for other purposes.The effect of subsection (2), which reproduces a similar provision in the Act of 1SS2, appears to bo to enable.the council of a borough at their dis-cretion to renew leases which were ordinarily renewable before 1S35. The number of such leases now outstanding is probably small, but in tho absence of any evidence that the practice is entirly obsolete we have thought it right to reproduce the provision.Subsection (3) of the Clauso combines Sections 10S(1) and 109 of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1S82. The effect of these sections was discussed in Davis v. Corporation of Leicester (1894) 2 Ch. 20S.Clause 174. This Clauso reproduces Section 129 of the Housing Act, 1925 (re-enacting a provision of tho Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909), which provides that where tho land of ono local authority is purchased by another and purchase monoy would otherwise be paid into Court, tho Minister may determine how the purchase money is to be applied and thereby save tho expense of legal proceedings. Tho number of occasions when such a provision comes into play aro likely to be few, but there is obviously no reason why it should be limited to land acquired for housing purposes, and the Clause makes it of general application.Clause 175.   See paragraph 97 of the Roport.Part VIII.EXPENSES.Clause ISO. This Clauso reproduces Section 6S (4) and (5) of the Local Government Act, 18S8, tho language being altered to conform with tho now rating system introduced by tho Rating and Valuation Act, 1925.   Subsection
(9) of Section 68 has been rendered obsolete bv Section 12 (1) of the Act of 1925.Clause 181.   See paragraph 103 of the Report.Clause 182. This Clauso reproduces tho provisions of the Public Health Act, 1875, and the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, relating  to tho expenses of borough councils. Tho exceptions sot out in Sections 207 and 208 of tho Act of 1875, and in Section 143 (2) of the Act of 1882, have been rendered obsoleto by tho Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, and aro not reproduced.Clause 184. Section 140 of tho Act of 1882 and tho Fifth Sohodule to that Act provide in effect (a) that expenditure for a numbor of purposes named in Parts I and II of the Schedule and subsection (3) of the section may bo charged on the borough fund, and (6) that in the case of tho purposes named in Part I of tho Schedulo and in subsection (3) tho payment may bo made without an order of tho council, but in other cases not. Some of theso purposes relate to tho administration of justice and police, and therefore fall outside tho scope of the draft Bill. In order to shorten and simplify tho law the Clauso is confined to a statemont of tho payments which may be made without an ordor of the council, coupled with a provision that all other payments require such an order. Provision for tho expenses of the council boing charged to the general rate fund is already mado in Clauso 182, and in so far as the payments mentioned in Part II fall within the scope of tho Bill provision is made in the Bill for theso payments being treated as expenses of tho council. The items in Part II of the Fifth Schedule which relate to justice and police are left outstanding.Tho words in subsection (2) of the Clause &quot; and the same order may include several payments &quot; are taken from Section 80 (1) of tho Local Govern -ment Act, 1888.Clause 185.   See note on Clause 182.Clause 187. Undor Section 229 of the Public Health Act, 1875, the Minister of Health has power to determine that any expenses incurred or payable by a rural district council in or in respect of any contributory place within the district shall be special expenses, but this provision is restricted by the earlier part of the section to expenses incurred or payable under the Public Health Acts. Section 49 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890 (which is an adoptive section), empowers the Minister, on the applica-tion of a rural district council, to declare any expenses incurred by the council to be special expenses. Subsection (3) of tho Clause reproduces Section 49 of the Act of 1890 but makes it of general application. It is drafted on tho view (which has been held by the Local Government Board and Ministry of Health) that the section enables the Ministry on the application of the rural district council to declare any expenses to be special expenses notwithstanding that they are made payable as general expenses either by Section 229 of the Act of 1875 or by some Act passed subsequent to the Act of 1890.Tho proviso to subsection (3) reproduces proviso (6) to Section 29 of the Local Government Act, 1894. Its effect is to enable the Minister in suitable cases to alter the incidence of the rate. Section 3 (2) of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, exempts certain classes of owners (including owners of tithe rentchargo and railway and canal companies) from three-fourths of any special rate on the ground that they are unlikely to derive much benefit from those rates, which are usually for providing sewerage, water supplies, or other sanitary purposes. If a particular item of expenditure is declared to be special as benefiting only part of the district, it does not necessarily follow that there is any case for exempting the particular classes of owners in question, and accordingly a discretion is conferred on tho Ministor to direct that tho expenses are to be levied on the same footing as a general rate.Clause 18S. This Clauso is now, and is inserted to assimilate the law applicable to rural district councils to thot applicable to comity councils.
149Clause 190. Subsection (1) of Section 11 of tho Local Governmont Act, 1S94, prohibits a parish council, without tho consent of a parish meeting, from incurring any expense or liability which will involvo a rate exceeding threepence in the pound (now, by virtue of Section 75 of tho Local Governmont Act, 1929, fourponco in the pound) for any local financial year. It is not clear whether this provision was intended to secure that tho parish meeting should bo consulted on any individual oxpenso or liability which would by itself involvo a rate of over tho specified amount, or whether, if onco the rate for all oxponses oxcoodod that sum, all additional oxponsos or liabilities, of however small an amount, must bo submitted to tho parish meeting for thoir approval. Subsection (3) of tho samo section limits tho sum raised in any local financial year by a parish council for thoir expenses (othor than expenses undor the adoptivo Acts) to a sum equal to a rato of sixpenco (now eightpence) in tho pound. Wo havo combined both limitations in a provision which is drafted in terms of limits on rato poundage, and havo provided for this amount being calculated in the simplest possible manner.Subsection (5) of tho Clauso reproduces Section 19 (9) of tho Act of 1894, but tho words &quot; subject to provisions mado by a grouping order,&quot; which appear in the opening sontenco of that section, havo been omitted. If they wore intended to apply to subsection (9) at all, which seems doubtful, thoir oifoct would presumably bo to enable the grouping order to substitute some highor or lower figure for tho rato of sixpenco (now, by virtue of the Act of 1929, oightpence). It is unlikely that any such substitution was intended by Parliament, and in any event tho Minister is ompowored to increase the rate poundageSection 11 (4) of the Act of 1894 conferred on tho parish council or chair-man of tho parish mooting the samo powers as a board of guardians had for obtaining contributions to the common fund. This roforrod to tho powers conferred on boards of guardians by Soction 1 of tho Poor Rate Act, 18U9, under which a precept could bo enforced by distress by means of a warrant under tho hands of two justices. An altornativo power of enforcing precepts by tho appointmont of a receiver has now been conferred upon precepting authorities, including apparently parish councils, by Section 13 of tho Ratine and Valuation Act, 1925.Part IX.BORROWING POWERS.Clause 191. Paragraph (rf) of Section 69 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1SS8, allows a county council, with the consent of the Minister, to borrow for the purpose of making advances to persons or bodies of persons &quot; in aid of tho emigration or colonisation of the inhabitants of tho county,&quot; with a guarantee for the repayment of such advances. This provision has been omitted from the Clause and left outstanding in tho Act of 1SSS. It repre-sonts a special power conferred on county councils and does not form part of tho general local governmont code.Clause 192. The Public Authorities and Bodies (Loans) Act, 1916-introduced a further method of borrowing, namely, by means of the issue of bearer securitios. Under that Act, county, borough and urban district councils havo power, with the consent of tho Treasury, to borrow by the issue of bearer bonds, whether within or without tho United Kingdom, and if thought fit in any foreign currency. The Act was originally a temporary ono, but was made permanent by the Housing (Additional Powors) Act, 1919. Wo have been in communication with tho Treasury on tho subject of this Act, and understand that it was introduced as a war time measure designed to ease tho dollar exchange position, and that at the date when it was made permanent it was anticipated that borrowings on a dollar basis might still he serviceable.   Wo understand, howovcr, that the present position is entirely
different, and that a local authority would not now bo permitted to make a foroign issuo. Tho powers of tho Act havo in fact boon used on ono occasion only, viz., in 1920, and for practical purposes it is now a dead letter. In these circumstances wo havo thought it right not to reproduce tho Act in tho draft Bill, and wo recommend its repeal without ro-enactmont.Clause 193.   Seo paragraphs l&apos;08 and 109 of tho Roport.Clause 195. This Clauso is taken from local Acts. Soo paragraph 100 of tho Roport.Clause 190. This Clauso reproduces Section 09 (7) of tho Local Govern-ment Act, 18S8, but has been oxtendod to all local authorities.Clause 19S. This Clause is new, and has been inserted to fill a gap in tho oxisting law.Clause 199. Section 70 of tho Local Government Act, 1888, and Section 52 of tho Publio Health Acts Amendmont Act, 1890, both provide for the regulations applying provisions of the Local Loans Act, 1875, and of Acts relating to stock issued by tho Metropolitan Board of Works or by tho cor-poration of a municipal borough. It ha3 never been found necessary or convenient to apply any of thoso provisions, and tho power has accordingly been omitted.Clause 200. Following tho general practico adopted by the Committee this Clauso provides for forms of mortgage boing proscribed instead of being scheduled to tho Act as in Section 230 of tho Public Health Act, 1875.Clause 201. Tliis Clauso provides for the form of transfers of mortgages also being prescribed.Clause 202. Subsection (1) departs slightly from Section 237 of tho Public Health Act, 1S75, in placing on tho clerk to the local authority a per-sonal obligation to keep tho register of mortgages.The provision in subsection (3) of tho Clause for the doposit with the clork of probate or lotters of administration is now, but is based on numerous local Act precedents. Tho Public Health Act makes no provision for the entry in the register of transfers of mortgages devolving on the death, bankruptcy, etc., of tho mortgageo, though tho matter is dealt with both in the Local Loans Act, 1S75, and in tho Stock Regulations. A Clause is frequently inserted in local Acts providing that the local authority aro not to be required to register transfers in these circumstances unless probate, letters of administration or other sufficient evidence is produced. The present Clause adapts this to the general structure of the Public Health Act code by placing an obligation on tho clerk to register a transmission on tho production of proper evidence and the payment of a fee.Subsection (5) of the Clauso empowers tho Minister of Health to make resulations for tho purpose of enabling entries in oxisting registers to bo trans-ferred to the register of mortgages kept under the Clause. This is a necessary-transitional provision.By subsection (7) the penalty recoverable under Section 23S of tho Public Health Act, 1S75, for a wilful neglect or refusal to make an entry in a register of transfers of mortgages has been extended to a wilful neglect or refusal to make an entry in the register of mortgages.Clauses 203 to 206. Theso are useful Clauses not in the existing general law, but common in local Acts.Clause 207. The form of Section 239 of the Public Health Act, 1875, has been considerably altered in this Clause in order to bring the language more into line with that of tho Local Loans Act, 1875 (Section 12) and the Stock Regulations (Article 43). Following the latter code a period of two months has been substituted for six months as the period on the expiration of which tho power to apply for a receiver arises, and application is to bo mado to the High Court and not, as under the Act of 1875, to a Court of Summary
1Jurisdiction or, undor tho Local Loans Act, 1S75, to tho Comity Court. In view of the fact that the minimum sum involved is  1,000, and that in practice these applications are very raro, tho Committee consider that tho High Court is tho appropriate tribunal.Under subsection (2) of tho Clauso tho Court may empower tho receiver to mako any necessary rate. There is no corresponding provision in the Act of 1875, but a power of this naturo is containod in tho Local Loans Act, IS75, tho London County Council (Finance Consolidation) Act, 1912, and in tho Stock Regulations. In theso circumstances wo havo folt justified in including a power of this nature in the Clause.Clause 20S. This Clauso slightly enlarges Section 234 (4) of tho Public Health Act, 1S75, by enabling a loan to bo paid off partly by instalments and partly by means of a sinking fund.Clause 209. This Clauso substantially reproduces Section 234 (5) of tho Public Health Act, 1875, so far as regards accumulating sinking funds, but follows local Act precedents in giving the borrowing authority tho option of creating a non-accumulating sinking fund. Subsection (3) of tho Clauso reproduces Section 79 of the Public Health Act, 1925.We havo considered whether provision should bo mado in the Bill for onabling local authorities to uso for any purposes for which sanction to raise a loan has been given moneys which form part of a sinking fund but are not for tho time being required. Clauses of this naturo have been inserted in many local Acts. Whilst wo appreciate that the power is in certain circumstances a valuable one, wo think that to confer it indiscriminately on local authorities of all types would not be appropriate to a Bill of this kind, and we havo accordingly not inserted tho provision.Clause 210.   This Clause follows local Act precedents.Clause 211. This Clauso represents a combination of Section 3 of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921, which provides for borrowing on short term loans, and Section 12 (2) of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925. Section 3 of the Act of 1921 enables a local authority, with the consent of the ^linister of Health, to borrow temporarily for meeting current expenses, but provides that the sums borrowed, together with the interest thereon, are to be repaid out of the revenues received in respect of the financial year in which the expenses are incurred, subject to a proviso which authorised the Minister temporarily to extend the term for repayment up to ten years. Section 12 (2) of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, enables the treasurer of a local authority to advance temporarily sums (a) which the authority are authorised to raiso by loan, or (6) which they require for meeting current expenses pending the receipt of rates and revenues, and empowers the authority to pay interest at a reasonable rate on such advances. Advances under this latter section do not require the consent of the Minister.The provision in Section 3 of the Act of 1921 enabling the period of repay-ment to be extended up to ten years has now expired, and consequently the section has become in effect a power to borrow for temporary expenses pending the receipt of revenues, and is thus overlapped by Section 12 (2) of tho Act of 1925. It is unnecessary to confer an express power on a treasurer of a local authority to advance money to the authority if, as we have sug-gested in paragraph SO of the Report, Section 193 of the Public Health Act, 1S75, which prohibits certain officers of local authorities from contracting with the authority, is not re-enacted. Accordingly wo have framed a Clause which, in our view, re-enacts the substance of the two sections referred to above by enabling a local authority, without the consent of any sanc-tioning authority, to borrow temporarily by way of overdraft or otherwise  (a) sums required to meet expenses pending the receipt of revenues, and (6) sums temporarily required to meet expenses which ultimately will be met by the raising of a permanent loan.
Wo understand that temporary borrowings for tho latter purpose oro common, and that not infroquontly a substantial time elapses before tho pormanent loan is raised. That being so, it is important that tho procodure for repaying tho debt by means of a sinking fund or otherwise should bogin to oporato as soon as the temporary advance is made. Otherwise the method of raising money by temporary advance might be used by an authority in order to evade its proper obligation to amortiso tho loan. Tho Clauso makes provision for this point, and in this respect roproducos tho oxisting practioe.Clause 212. Under Section C9 (3) of the Local Govornmont Act, 1888, a county council may re-borrow without the consent of the Minister of Hoalth. and under local Acts a similar re-borrowing powor is common. Under Section 233 of tho Public Health Act, 1875, tho consent of the Minister is required both for borrowing and re-borrowing.Tho Clauso follows tho lines of a Clauso which has been inserted in many-local Acts, and enables re-borrowing to be effected without the consent of any sanctioning authority.The proviso to subsection (2) of tho Clause, following Section 234 (6) of tho Publio Health Act, 1875, enables tho authority which sanctioned the original loan to permit tho extension of tho term for repaying the reborrowed money for any further period within tho maximum period allowed for the original loan.Clause 214. Tho definition of &quot; statutory securities &quot; includes not only trustee securities, but also the stock and other securities created by local authorities other than those transferable by delivery. Under the goneral law local authorities are limited to investing in trustee securities. In sug-suggesting a somewhat wider power of investment we have been guided by the practice of Parliament in dealing with local Bills. For many years local authorities have sought and obtained from Parliament power to invest in the securities of other local authorities ; and the only distinction between the power as provided by the definition of &quot; statutory securities &quot; in this Clause and the common form local Act power is that under the definition in the Clause the term &quot; local authority &quot; will have the more limited meaning which it has throughout the Bill, and will therefore not include joint boards and other bodies which usually fall within the meaning of the term.It will be observed that Clause 209 (2) prohibits a local authority investing in securities created by itself.Part X.ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT.Clause 215. Section 247 of the Public Health Act, 1875, which is in part re-enacted in this Clause, uses the expression &quot; the accounts of the receipts and expenditure.&quot; Under modorn practice the accounts kept by tho majority of local authorities are accounts of income and expenditure, not of receipts and payments, but some of the smaller authorities retain the old system. Accordingly the words &quot; of receipts and expenditure &quot; have been omitted, and in Clause 231 the provisions of Section 5 of tho District Auditors Act, 1S79, which enables tho Minister to make regulations with respect to accounts and audit, have been slightly extonded so as to enable regulations to be made to prescribe the financial transactions to be recorded in tho accounts.Clause 216. Section 4 of the District Auditors Act, 1879, provides that an assistant distriot auditor is to have the same powers and duties as the district auditor &quot; subject to any exceptions made by the terms of his appointment.&quot; We understand that under modern conditions tho staff of a district auditor
includes a numbor of officors who aro not technically assistant district auditors, and that tho practice of tho Ministry of Health is to permit these officors to undertake any of tho duties of tho district auditor, except tho important functions of allowance, disallowance, and surcharge. Subsection (3) of tho Clauso has accordingly been drafted so as to permit the Minister to confer on any of tho officers appointed to assist tho district auditor any of tho lattor&apos;s powers except thoso montionod above.Clause 218. Sections 3 and 7 of tho District Auditors Act, 1879, which aro reproduced in this Clause, placo an obligation on tho local authority to submit financial statements, and provide that if the authority fail to do so tho authority or, if there is a clerk to tho authority, tho clerk or, if thoro is no clerk, tho treasurer or other officer keoping tho accounts, is to bo liable to a fine. Tho caso in which there is neither a clork nor a treasurer or othor officer keeping tho accounts is hardly likoly to ariso, and consequently in practice tho penalty must bo inflicted on the clerk, treasurer or other officer, notwithstanding that tho failure is that of tho local authority. This is illogical, and accordingly we havo substituted tho word &quot; and &quot; for &quot; or ,&quot; and thereby made the authority itself liable concurrently with the clerk, treasurer or other officer.Wo have also inserted in the Clauso a provision corresponding with provisions in Clauso 195 (5) (failure to make a return of loans) and Clause 241 (1) (failure to make a local financial return) enabling the obligation to be enforced by mandamus at the instance of the Minister notwithstanding that proceedings for a fine havo been taken.Clause 219. By Section 1 of the Audit (Local Authorities) Act, 1922, all accounts which are subject to district audit are required to be made up yearly to tho 31st March. Under Section 26 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1S82, the treasurer of a borough is required to make up his accounts half-yearly and submit them to the borough auditors. Section 58 of the Local Government Act, 1894, provides that tho accounts of parish and district councils (wliich term includes tho council of a non-county borough) aro to be made up yearly to tho 31st March, &quot; or in the case of accounts required to be audited half-yearly, to the 30th September and the 31st March &quot; in each year. The Clause assimilates these provisions by requiring accounts of all local authorities to be made up yearly to the 31st March, or to such other date as the Minister may direct.Section 58 of the Act of 1894 also requires tho accounts of non-county boroughs and district and parish councils to be in such form as the Minister may prescribe, and partly overlaps with the District Auditors Act, 1879, which had already empowered the Department to prescribe the form in which all accounts audited by district auditors are to be kept. No form of accounts has in fact ever been prescribed for non-county boroughs, and accordingly the provisions of Section 58 of the Act of 1894, so far as they apply to those boroughs, have not been re-enacted.By virtue of Section 58 of the Act of 1894, and Section 14 (1) of the Local Government (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916, the Minister is empowered to modify, as regards the accounts of any local authority, the provisions of Section 247 (3) and (10) of the Public Health Aot, 1875, wliich relate to the publication of a notice of audit, and of the abstract of accounts and the report of the auditor. In view of the provisions of Section 58 of the Act of 1894, a power for the Minister to make regulations on these matters is inserted in the Clause 231, and the provisions of Section 247 of the Act of 1875 dealing with these matters have not been reproduced.C7ai.se 220. Under Section 247 (4) of the Publio Health Act, 1875, all documents relating to tho accounts to be audited are required to be deposited at the &quot; offices &quot; of the local authority.   In the case of coimties it has been
Illfound inconvenient for all documents (many of which aro in current use) to be deposited at tho head offices of tho county council, and tho books are ofton examined locally by tho auditors assistants. In tho circumstances tho words &quot; appropriate office &quot; have been substituted for &quot; offices &quot; in subsection (1) of this Clause.Clause 222. Tho words &quot;local government elector&quot; havo boon subs-ti-tuted for &quot; owner or ratepayer &quot; (sec paragraph 09 of tho Report).Clause 224. Subsection (2) of this Clauso reproduces Section 12 (3) of tho Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, but tho words &quot; or to collect other rovenues,&quot; are now. They aro intended to cover such matters as a wilful failure to collect tho rents of municipal housing estates. Tho Act of 1925 was an Act dealing with rating and valuation, and Section 12 (3) was natur-ally limited to losses duo to failure to collect rate3 or to issue precepts. The effect of incorporating this subsection, as it stands, in an audit codo would bo to leave it at least doubtful whether a loss of interest due to wilful failure to collect revenues other than rates was a loss which might give rise to action by the auditor. We feel no doubt that the Legislature did not intend to draw any distinction in this matter between rates and other rovenues.Clause 231. Under tho existing law a person who wilfully neglects or disobeys any of the regulations referred to in the Clause is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding  5 for a first offence, and to a fine not exceeding  20 and not less than  5 for a second offence. A third or sub-sequent offence is made a misdemeanour for which the offender is liable on indictment to ten years imprisonment and to a fine of  20. In accordance with modern practico wo have substituted a fine not exceeding  5 for a first offence, and a fine not oxceeding  20 for a second or subsequent offence. In all cases the fino will bo recoverable summarily.Clause 235.   See Xote. on Clauso 219.The section of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, reproduced in para-graph (c) of tins Clause requires the borough treasurer to print a full abstract of the accounts. The meaning of tho word &quot; full &quot; has given rise to doubt, and we understand that in order to ensure compliance with the law it is not uncommon for long abstracts to be printed at considerable expense. We have accordingly omitted the word &quot; full.&quot;Clause 237. In this Clause the word &quot; examine &quot; has been substituted for tho word &quot; tax,&quot; which appears in Section 249 of the Public Health Act. 1875. The function of the clerk of tho peace is not to tax the bill of costs as between the local authority and their solicitor see Southarnpton Guardians v. Bell, 1SS8, 21 Q.B.D. 297, and In re Porter, Amphlett v. Jones, 1912, 2 Ch.9S  and it is thought that the word &quot; tax &quot; is for that reason misleading.We have omitted the third paragraph of Section 249 of the Act of 1875. The meaning and intention of that paragraph, which follows almost verbatim the language of Section 35 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1844, is by no means clear, but if read literally the paragraph produces the curious result that if the bill has already been taxed by the clerk of the peace the auditor&apos;s subsequent decision is appellable to the High Court or to the Minister, whereas if it has not, the auditor&apos;8 decision is final. Section 35 of the Act of 1844 was fully considered in B. v. Hunt (1856), 6 E. and B. 408. In that ease several of the judges found difficulty in construing the section or understanding what could have been the object of the Legislature, and tho comment was made by Erie J., that of all subjects that of attorneys&apos; bills required a peculiar species of knowledge not likely to lio within tho knowledge of an auditor. The difficulties to which the provision gives rise are so fully set out in the judi-ments in that case that it is unnecessary to refer to them in detail, but we may point out that the question whether tho auditors decision is final as against everyono, or is only final as against the local authority, was left undeter-rnined, and further that tho effect of the provision on tho Local Authorities
(Audit) Act, 1927, is by no means clear. The position as botwoon tho clerk of tho poaco and tho auditor is mado sufficiently clear by tho first paragraph of Section 249 (reproduced in subsection (1) of tho Claviso), and wo aro satisfied t.hnt the third paragraph should bo repealed without re-onnctment.Part XI.LOCAL FINANCIAL RETURNS.Clause 239. Subsection (3) provides a single codo in placo of tho pro-viaions of tho Local Taxation Returns Acts, 1800 and 1877, and of Section 28 of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, which at present constitute different eodes dealing with the same subject matter. Tho provisions of paragraph (6) of tho subsection aro taken from tho Local Taxation Returns Acts, which, in this respect, differ slightly from Section 2S of tho Act of 1882.Clause 241. Undor the oxisting law, tho penalty for failuro to mako a return is  20, recoverable by action in the High Court. The Clauso makes the penalty recoverable on summary conviction, and provides that not-withstanding the recovery of a penalty tho making of tho return may be enforced, at the instance of tho Minister of Health, by mandamus. In practice difficulties havo arisen from tho fact that tho oxisting law doo3 not provide n method for enforcing a return whon onco tho penalty has been recovered.Part XII.BYELAWS.Clauses 244 and 245.   Seo paragraplis 117 to 121 of tho Report.Clause 246. Tho maximum penalties for breaches of byelaws undor the existing law vary from  1 under the Education Act, 1921, to  50 undor the Merchant Shipping Act, 1S94. Section 23 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1S82, provides for a maximum of  5, and Section 183 of the Public Health Act, 1875, for a similar maximum, with a further maximum ponalty of  2 a day for continuing offences. A maximum of  5, coupled with penalties for continuing offences, is tho most usual provision, and this has been adopted in the Clauso. The Clause, however, saves existing enactments containing other penalties, and Parliament will be free in future enactments to fix other maxima, either higher or lowor, if they think it desirable.In accordance with modern practice, the date from which the continuhig offence runs will be the date of conviction and not, as in Section 183 of the Act of 1S75, tho date on which written notice of the offence is given by the local authority.Part XIII.PROMOTION OF, AND OPPOSITION TO, BILLS LN PARLIAMENT.Clause 248.   Seo paragraphs 122 to 125 of the Report.Clause 249. By Section 4 of tho Borough Funds Act, 1872, expenses incurred after the deposit of a Bill in Parliament may not be charged to the funds of the local authority, unless the propriety of the promotion of the Bill is confirmed at a second special meeting of the local authority, and this meeting must not bo held until aftor fourteen days from the date on which the Bill is deposited. Following on a Report mado in July, 1930, by the Select Committeo of the House of Commons on Private Bill Procedure recommending an alteration of tho Standing Orders of the House relating to Private Bills, tho Parliamentary Standing Orders have been amended so as to advance tho last day for tho deposit of Bills and for the sorvice of certain notices on owners. The Select Committoo pointed out that the effect of their recommendations would be to increase the amount of expen-dituro which, under Section 4 of tho Act of 1872, is theoretically unauthorised
and recommended that that section should bo amendod &quot; in such a way that expenditure which is necessary in order that Standing Orders may bo com-pliod with,&quot; should not bo unauthorised (H.C. 158 of 1930). Subsection (3) of the Clauso thoroforo provides that the second mooting shall bo hold as soon as may bo after the expiration of fourteen days after the doposit of the Bill, and that, unless tho promotion is confirmed, the local authority are to take stops to withdraw tho Bill. Tho effect of tho subsection will be that any oxpendituro incurred between the date of tho doposit of the Bill and the second mooting will form part of the ordinary and proper expense of pro-motion.Clause 250.   See paragraph 127 of tho Report.Clause 251. TJndor Section 6 of the Borough Funds Act, 1872, expenses incurred undor tho Act are to bo examined and allowed by a person authorised by tho Minister. Under tho House of Commons Costs Taxation Act, 1847 (subsequently amendod by the House of Commons Costs Taxation Act, 1879) and tho House of Lords Costs Taxation Act, 1849, the officers of the two Houses are empowered to tax tho expenses of Parliamentary agents, solicitors and others in connection with tho promotion of, and opposition to. Bills by municipal and other public authorities. Thus the duties of tho person appointed by tho Minister overlap largely with those of tho taxing officers of tho two houses and at present a bill of costs is liable to scrutiny (a) by the taxing officers of tho Houses ;(6) by the person appointed by the Minister ; and(c) by the auditor of the accounts of the authority.The Clauso abandons this triple scrutiny, and provides that expenses which are liable to be taxed under the Parliamentary Costs Acts are not to be charged to the authority&apos;s funds, unless thoy have been so taxed and allowed. The power of tho district auditor to surcharge extravagant expenditure is preserved.Clause 252. Subsection (1) reproduces part of Section 1 (2) of the County Councils (Bills in Parliament) Act, 1903, as amended by the Overseers Order, 1927, in consequence of the abolition of overseers by the Rating and Valua-tion Act, 1925. The joint effect of the Section and the Order is to confer on rating authorities a right of appeal to the Minister from tho decision of the county council. We understand, however, that there is no trace of this right of appeal having ever been exercised. We aro accordingly of opinion that the provision might bo repealed without re-enactment both as a measure of simplification, and as being in accord with tho recent view of Parliament as expressed in Section 56 (2) of the Local Government Act, 1929. The subsection is accordingly drawn in terms which make the decision of the county council final.Section 55 of the Local Government Act, 1929, applied tho provisions of tho Borough Funds Acts to rural district councils, but it is not entirely clear whether the language of Section 2 of the Borough fund Act, 1S72, would enable a rural district council to charge the expenses of promoting or opposing Bills as special expenses. We have assumed, however, that this was the intention of Parliament, and have provided for it in subsection (2) of the Clause. The decision of the council will be final as under Section 56 (2) of the Act of 1929.Part XIV.FREEMEN. See paragraph 128 of the Report.
153Part XV.GENERAL PROVISIONS.   &apos; Clause 261.   See paragraph 130 of tho Report.Clause 202. Section 2 of the Public Health and Local Government Conferences Act, 1885, does not extend either to county or borough councils. Special provisions with regard to the payment of oxponses incurred by tho attendunco of representatives of county councils at meetings of the County Councils Association are contained in tho County Councils Association Expenses Act, 1890, and an amending Act of 1920. Borough councils were probably omitted from the Act of 1885 on the ground that the general powers of municipal corporations were sufficiently wide. Section 114 of tho Poor Law Act, 1930, enables tho Minister of Health to authorise poor law authori-ties to pay tho reasonable expenses of their membors and clerk in attending conferences connected with the poor law, and Section 126 of the Education Act, 1921, contains an elaborate code with regard to expenses of attendances at meetings for educational purposes.In reproducing the Act of 1885 the Clauso oxtonds it to county and borough councils, but secures by the proviso that it is not to affect or overlap with tho provisions in the Education Act, 1921.Section 2 of the Act of 1885 refers to &quot;any conference or meeting of vicmbers of local authorities.&quot; We understand that tho words italicised havo given riso to doubt whether a conference attended both by members of local authorities and other persons is within tho scope of the Act. Tho language of tho Clauso makes it clear that all conferences summoned by local authorities or their associations for tho purposes mentioned in the Clauso are covered.Tho County Councils Association Expenses Acts, so far as they empower subscriptions to be made to tho funds of the County Councils Association, aro not reproduced and are left outstanding.Clause 263.   See paragraph 131 of the Report.Clause 264.   See paragraph 18 of the Report.In connection with subsection (2) of the Clause, the position as regards tho maintenance of closed churchyards is as follows. By Section 18 of the Burial Act, 1S55, the obligation to maintain closed churchyards was imposed on the churchwardens, but they were enabled, by issuing a certificate to the overseers, to throw the cost on the poor rate. Section 6 (1) (6) of the Local Government Act, 1894, transferred this obligation to the parish council of a rural parish, but provided that it was not to attach until a certificate had been given under Section 18 of the earlior Act. Thus, the effect of the legislation was to enable the churchwardens, if they so desired, to impose the cost of maintaining closed churchyards on tho ratepayers as a whole, but to secure that, if they did so, the responsibility for the churchyard passed into the hands of the civil authorities.By means of orders made under Section 33 (1) of the Act of 1894, the Local Government Board and the Ministry of Health not infrequently conferred on borough and urban district councils the powers and duties of parish councils in the matter of maintaining and repairing particular churchyards which had been closed, and in respect of which the churchwardens desired to give a certificate. Under Section 4 (1) (ii) of the Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure, 1921, the obligation to maintain closed churchyards, in so far as it was still vested in churchwardens, was transferred to the parochial church council.Subsection (2) of the Clause provides for a general transfer to borough and urban district councils of the duty of maintaining closed churchyards, thereby avoiding tue necessity for individual orders under Section 33 of the Act of 1894, as reproduced in the Bill. The Clause however maintains the existing position that the churchyard will only fall under the control of the50SS d
civil authorities when tho ecclesiastical authorities, i.c, tho parochial church council, think fit to givo a certificato under tho Burial Act, 1855, and thereby transfer tho financial responsibility to the ratepayers as a whole. As regards churchyards in a rural parish having a parish council, tho subsection ro-enacts tho oxisting law.Clause 265.   Seo paragraph 132 of the Roport.Clause 200. Subsection (4) of Section 33 of tho Local Government Act, 1S94, which is reproduced in this Clauso, provides that tho order is not to alter tho incidonco of any rato, and is to make provision &quot; for tho preservation-tion of tho oxisting interests of paid ofiicors.&quot; Wo think that for practical purposes tho first part of the subsection has been rendered unnecessary by the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925. As regards tho romaindor, wo under-stand that it has never been found necessary to provide, in an order made under tho Section, for tho &quot; oxisting interests of officors,&quot; except in tho caso of orders, now obsolete, dealing with tho appointment of assistant overseers. As tho section does not provide for a transformation of powers from ono authority to another, but for tho conferment of now powors, wo aro satisfied that tho question of affecting tho oxisting interests of officers does not ariso and accordingly tho subsection has not boon roproducod.Clause 209. Section 28 (2) of tho Local Government Act, IS88, provides for tho delegation by a county council to a district council of any powers transferred to tho county council by or in pursuance of that Act. Section 64 of the Local Government Act, 1894, enables a coimty council to employ a district council as their agents iri tho transaction of any administrative business on matters arising in, or affecting tho interests of, tho district.The preciso meaning of &quot; administrative business &quot; is uncertain. The Clause combines tho two provisions by giving a general powor of delegation with the exception of specific matters with which Parliament has plainly intended county councils to deal cither as a body or by moans of its own committees, or in respect of which specific powers of delegation to district councils aro conferred by other oxactments, eg., Section 35 of tho Local Government Act, 1929. Tho Clauso further provides that in exercising any function so delegated tho district council aro to act as agents of the county council.Clause 270. This Clauso reproduces the Local Government (Stock Transfer) Act, 1895, which amended tho Local Government Act, 1894. The Act of 1S94 did not deal with county councils, and consequently those councils were not included in the scope of the amending Act. There appears to be no reason why tho convenient and inexpensive procedure of tho Act should not extend to county councils in so far as it is applicable, and the Clause accord-ingly covers local authorities of all typo3.Clause 271. The provisions of Section 2 of the Borough Funds Act, 1872, enabling the local authority to apportion the charges amongst the various rates and funds, have been omitted in consequence of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925.Clause 272. The precise intention and effect of Section 259 of the Public Health Act, 1875, is by no means clear. We have considered the section in conjunction with similar provisions in other codes (Section 62 of the Valua-tion (Metropolis) Act, 1S69 ; Section 145 of the Education Act, 1921&apos;; Section 56 of tho Rating and Valuation Act, 1925 ; and Section 155 of the Poor Law Act 1930). There is no doubt that provisions of tliis kind in earlier Acts were aimed mainly at meeting the difficulty caused by the fact that the bodies in question were not incorporated, seo It. v. Justices of London, 1896, 1 Q.B. 659. This difficulty no longer exists, and we are satisfied that under modern conditions the underlying intention of Parliament is to enable an officer or member of the body concerned to cotiduot proceedings in a court
noof summary jurisdiction notwithstanding that ho is himself neither a solicitor nor tho person who laid tho information. Tho Clauso is drafted on this foot-ing.Clause 274. Tho roforonco in subsection (1) to tho powor of tho custos rotulorum to givo direction as to records and documents is reproduced from Section 5 (3) of tho Local Government (Clorks) Act, 1931. That Act ropoalod Section 83 (3) of tho Local Governmont Act, 1888, which provided that tho clerk of tho peaco should &quot; subject to tho directions of tho custos rotulorum or tho quarter sessions or tho county council, as tho caso may require, havo charge of, and ho responsible for, tho records and documents of tho county.&quot; Tho custos rotulorum is appointed imdor 37 Hen. 8, c. Land up to 1888, by virtue of tho samo Act, tho custos appointed tho clerk of tho peace. Noithor that Act, however, nor tho statute 1 Will, and Mary, c. 21, which gavo tho clerk of tho peaco a lifo offico during good bohaviour, containod any roferenco to tho custos giving directions as to records and documents. It is clear, however, that in 1S8S Parliament took the viow that powers of this kind existed, and that being so tho proper courso seems to bo to adopt tho languago of tho Act of 1931 and save tho powers whatovor thoy may be.Clause 275. Subsoction (2) of tho Clauso reproduces Section 2 of tho Parliamentary Documents Doposit Act, 1837. but omits tho provision for a feo being chargod for making copies of a document. In view of tho chargos for inspection, a further charge for the right of tho person inspecting to mako -i copy himself appears to bo unnecessary.Section G (1) of tho Local Governmont (Clerics) Act, 1931, which provides for a foo boing paid to tho clerk of a county council on tho deposit of map3 and other documents, is repealed by tho Bill without ro-onactmont. It is anomalous that fees should bo paid in tho caso of tho doposit of documents with a county council, but not with othor local authorities, and it appears to us that local authorities might reasonably be required to take custody of theso documents without feo, provided that thoy aro onablod to make proper charges for the oxpouso involved in tho documents boing availablo for public inspection.Clause 276. Section 17 (8) of tho Local Government Act, 1894, repro-duced in subsection (1) of this Clauso, applies only to rural parishes having parish councils. Tho powers of a parish council under tho section havo from time to time boon conferred upon borough and urban district councils by ordors made imder Section 33 of tho Act. In order to avoid tho trouble and oxponso involved in the making of theso orders wo recommend that as regards urban parishes theso powers should be conferred by the Bill itself on tho councils of boroughs and urban districts, and tho subsection provides accord-ingly.In the caso of rural parishes not having a parish council, the powor to direct tho manner in which parochial documents are to be kept and deposited (conferred by Section 6 of tho Vestries Act, 1818) was transferred to the parish meeting by Section 19 (4) of the Local Government Act, 1894.Clause 277. This Clause reproduces Section 2 of the Parochial Offices Act, 1861, which enabled overseers, with the consent of the vestry, to provide depositories for parochial documents. In a rural parish having a parish council the powers of the overseers under this soction passed to the parish council undor Section 6 (1) (c) of the Local Government Act, 1894. In urban parishes, and rural parishes not having a separate parish council, the powers were transferred to tho rating authority by the Overseers Order, 1927.Clause 27S. In connection with the inspection of minutes and other documents of local authorities, there is a substantial difference between the law applying to county and borough councils and that applying to rural district coimcils, parish councils and parish meetings. In the case of urban district councils, there aro no statutory provisions relating to the inspectionU03S p&apos;
of documents. We believe that it is generally recognised that tho provisions of tho Local Government Act, 1894, which apply to rural authorities, and enable any parochial elector to inspoct all documents, aro too wido (seo Jl. v. Godstone R.D.G. (1911) 2 K.B., 465). Tho Clauso accordingly provides a single codo applicable to all local authorities, and follows generally tho provisions of Section 233 of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1882.Clause 279. Section 83 of tho Local Govornmont Act, 1888, requires county councils to send to tho Secretary of Stato or tho Ministor such returns and information as Parliament may require. Section 51 (1) of tho Local Government Act, 1929 (which applies to all local authorities as defined in tho present Bill and joint committees and boards) requires them to furnish such reports and returns as tho Minister may require.Tho Clauso combines tho two provisions and slightly extends them by applying tho earlier ono to all local authorities and the latter to reports and returns required by the Secretary of State.Clause 2S0. Section 297 (1) of tho Public Health Act, 1875, requires public notice of tho purport of tho proposed order to be advertised in two successive weeks in a local newspaper. Two slight changes are introduced in subsection (1) (a) of the Clause. Public notico is required to be given of tho purport of the application, and not of tho proposed order. The terms of the former aro frequently wider than those of the latter. Further, tho roquire-ment of giving public notico in a newspaper in two successive weeks frequently gives riso to practical difficulties, and tho Clause substitutes ono notico in a local newspaper and ono in tho London Gazette. It is believed that publica-tion in the London Gazette will bo valuable to statutory undertakers and similar bodies who may bo affected.Clause 2s2. This Clause, which deals with tho method of serving notices on local authorities, reproduces provisions of tho First Schedule to tho Local Government Act, 1S94, relating to parish meetings and parish councils. Wo have thought it convenient to make tho Clauso cover all types of local authorities and to extend it to notices given not only under tho Bill but also under Acts passed after tho commencement of the Bill, so as to avoid tho necessity of inserting similar Clauses in future legislation.Clause 2S2. This Clause provides a method by which public notices are to bo given by local ntithoritics of all kinds. So far as regards parish notices, it reproduces provisions of the Vestries Act, LSI 8, the Parish Notices Act, 1837, and tho Local Government Act, 1894.Clause 2S5. This Clauso is based on Section 87 of tho Local Government Act, 18SS, and Section 129 of tho Local Government Act, 1929. The former section applies Sections 293 to 296 of the Public Health Act, 1875. Section 296 of the last named Act confers on inspectors of the Ministry of Health in relation to tho summoning of witnesses, the production of papors, etc., similar powers to those of inspectors under tho Acts relating to the relief of tho poor. These powers are now contained in Section 160 of the Poor Law Act, 1930. Under subsection (2), proviso (a), of that section, a person cannot bo required, in obedience to tho summons of an inspector, to go more than ten miles from his place of abode. In view of the increase in the facilities for travelling which has taken place since the time when the enactment reproduced in Section 160 of the Poor Law Act, 1930 (namely the Poor Law Board Act, 1S47) was passed, tho Clause provides that a person is not to be -required to go more than ten miles, unless the necessary expenses of hi? attendance are tendered to him.Sunsection (3) of Section 160 of tho Act of 1930 provides that a person who wilfully neglects to attend in obedience to a summons shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. Here, as elsewhere, wo havo substituted a penalty of a fine, or imprisonment, or both, on summary conviction.
Clause 287. This Clause, which deals with tho Isles of Scilly, takes the placo of Section 49 of tho Local Government Act, 1888. It differs from that Section in tho following respects (1) Tho Clnuso recognises tho existenco of tho Council of tho Isles of Scilly which was set up in 1891 by moans of an order under the Act of 1888 ;(2) Following tho precedent set by Parliament in Section 138(3) of tho Local Government Act, 1929, it substitutes n simple order for a provisional ordor ;(3) Tho power of tho Minister to mnUo orders is limited by tho insertion of tho words &quot; upon tho application of tho Council of the Isles of Scilly.&quot;Wo understand that difficulty bos been experienced in construing tho words of Section 49 of tho Act of 188S &quot; for the application to tho Islands of any provisions of any Act touching local government.&quot; Wo have replaced theso with words which make it clear that the order may deal with any powers or duties for tho time being conforred or imposed on local authorities.Clause 2SS. A number of statutes provide for tho establishment of joint boards or joint committees of local authorities by order of a Government Department, in some cases tho order being provisional and requiring Parlia-mentary confirmation. Tho language of the statutes vorios considerably, but they usually contain words which onablo tho ordor to include supploment-ary and ancillary provisions, and in somo cases provide in terms for tho orders applying, with tho necessary modifications, provisions of Acts of Parliament. Examples of theso order-making powers will bo found in Sections 279 to 281 of the Public Health Act, 1S75, Section 1 of tho Sea Fisheries Act, 18SS, Section 29 of tho Mental Deficiency Act, 1913, Section 5 of tho Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act, 1921, and Sojtion 3 of tho Local Government Act, 1929. Wo understand that it has been the practice for many years, both in orders and provisional orders mado under these powers, to apply appropriate provisions of the Public Health Act, 1S75, and tho Local Govern-ment Act, 1S94, and that as a result of the passing of the latter Act somo thirty provisional orders were made and confirmed in the year 1S96 amending earlier orders by substituting provisions of the Act of 1894 for those of the Act of 1875. In our opinion this is eminently a matter on which a single code will be convenient, and we havo accordingly provided in this Clause a code which will apply to any joint board or joint committee formed by order or provisional order whether undor existing or future Acts. The Clauso enables any appropriate provisions of.tho Bill to bo applied to joint boards or joint committees with tho necessary modifications, subject to two exceptions : -(a) that if a power to acquire land compulsorily is conferred by the order, tho proceduro for acquisition must be that of provisional order and not of departmental order ; and(6) that the order may not impose district audit on a board consisting entirely of authorities whose general accounts are not subject to district audit.Wo think that, if tho Bill becomes law, oxisting joint boards and joint committees will probably find it convenient to have their orders amended so as to apply tho provisions of the Bill in place of those of earlier Acts, and in order to avoid tho expense involved in a large number of provisional orders, we have provided in subsection (2) of tho Clauso that an order amend-ing an existing provisional ordor, by substitviting tho provisions of the new for those of tho old code, need not be confirmed by Parliament if it is made on tho application of the joint board or joint committeo concerned and within two years from tho commencement of the present Bill.Clause 291. This Clause, wliich deals with references to population &quot; according to tho last published census for the time being,&quot; has been some
what elaborated to moot a difficulty which wo undorstand has been oxporienced in tho past. In many local governmont statutes powers aro conferred or duties imposed on tho councils of aroas having a specified population &quot; according to tho last published census for the time being,&quot; or &quot; according to the returns of tho last census,&quot; and tho question has from timo to time arisen whether tho figures of population appended to tho Rogistrar-Gonerars Provisional Report on tho census returns are to bo treated as giving the facts of population within tho meaning of those two phrases. We aro satis-fied that in tho various contexts in which tho words occur in this Bill it would bo highly inconvenient if the figures in tho Provisional Report were taken as tho criterion, since tho effect might be to set in motion olaborato machinery which might havo to be reversed if, in a caso near the border-line, tho final figures differed even slightly from the preliminary ones. The Clauso accordingly makes it clear that only tho final figures aro to be taken into account for this purpose.SECOND SCHEDULE. Part I.Paragraph 1. Section 54 of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1SS2, provides that tho notice of election is to bo affixed &quot; on tho town hall, and in the caso of a ward election, in.somo conspicuous place in tho ward.&quot; This provision was applied to county council elections by Section 75 of tho Local Government Act, 1SS8, but that Act did not substitute any particular place for tho &quot; town hall &quot; in tho application of tho section to county council olections. We havo rectified this omission by proposing the arrangements shown in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 1.Paragraph 2. Soction 51 (2) of tho Municipal Corporations Act, lSS2j as applied to county council olections by Section 75 of tho Local Government Act, 1888, provides that no porson shall subscribo a nomination paper for more than ono electoral division. Wo understand that it is not practicable to enforce this provision in county council elections where the nomination papers are adjudicated upon by the various deputy returning officers. This provision has accordingly been omitted from sub-paragraph (3).Paragraph (2) of Part II of tho Third Schedule to the Act of 1S82 provides that an elector may subscribe &quot; as many nomination papers as there aro vacancies to be filled,&quot; and paragraph (10) provides that &quot; where a person subscribes moro nomination papers than one, his subscription shall bo inoperative in all but the one which is first delivered.&quot; It was held in Line v. Warren (1SS4) 14 Q.B.D. 73 and 548, that paragraph (10) must be read as restricted to cases where a person subscribes more than one nomination paper for the same candidate, or more nomination papers than there are vacancies to be fdled, and sub-paragraph (4) has been drafted accordingly.Paragraph 3.   See paragraph 36 of the Report.Paragraphs 5 and 6.   See paragraph 23 of tho Report.Paragraph 7. At an election of county or borough councillors, if the number of valid nominations exceeds the numbor of vacancies, any candidate may withdraw until tho number of remaining candidates is equal to the num-ber of vacancies, provided that such withdrawals take place before two o&apos;clock on the day following the last day for delivery of nomination papers. With-withdrawals must therefore take place before tho question of the validity of the nomination is decided.In the case of elections of urban and rural district councillors, candidates may withdraw at any time up to four days after tho decision as to the validity of the nomination papers is given, and there is no restriction as to the number of candidates who may withdraw.
156In order to assimilato tho procedure applying to olections of county and borough councillors to that in forco at elections of urban and rural district councillors this paragraph permits withdrawals to tako placo after tho decision on tho validity of tho nomination papers has been given, and removes the restriction on the number of candidates who may withdraw.Paragraph 8.   See paragraph 33 of tho Report.Part II.See paragraph 20 of the Report.Part III.Paragraph 2. Undor paragraph 15 of Part II of tho Third Schedulo to tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, the town clerk is required to affix to tho town hall, at least four days beforo tho day of election, the names and addresses of tho candidates and their proposers and seconders. Under paragraph 2 of Part III of tho samo Schedulo tho mayor must give a similar length of notico of tho situation, division and allotment of tho polling places, and of tho description of the persons entitled to voto thereat. In tho Election Rules governing the election of district and parish councillors thoso two separato notices havo boon combined in a single &quot; notico of poll &quot; which is required to sot out the particulars stated in (a) to (/) of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph. Wo have thought it convenient to follow tho system adopted in the Election Rules and to provide for a singlo notico of poll.Paragraph 4. Tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1SS2, provides that tho provisions of tho Ballot Act, 1872, which enable a returning officer to uso schools or public rooms for polling places are not to apply to municipal elections. On tho other hand, tho Local Governmont Acts of 1888 and 1894 not only enable returning officers to uso such schools or rooms for polls at county council, district council and parish council elections, but further pro-vido that thoy may bo used for the purpose of counting the votes. Although tho uso of schools and public rooms for these purposes is not so necessary in boroughs as in rural districts, there appears to be no reason for continuing this distinction, and this paragraph accordingly applies the Ballot Act pro-visions to local government elections of all types.Paragraph 16. By Section 59 (1) of tho Municipal Corporations Act, 1SS2, a presiding officer at an election of county councillors or borough councillors is obliged to put certain questions to any person attending at tho polling station to vote, for the purpose of ascertaining whother he is in fact entitled to vote, if required to do so by two electors or by a candidate or his agent. At district and parish council election&quot; the presiding officer is not only obliged to put theso questions if so requested, but may do so on his own motion. The practice of candidates at local government elections appoint-ing agents to attend at polling stations is not so common now as it used to be, and we think it desirable that a presiding officer should havo the power on his own motion of satisfying himself that a person presenting himself to vote is in fact entitled to do so if he has cause to suspect personation. This paragraph provides accordingly.Paragraph 17. Section 86 of the Parliamentary Voters Registration Act, 1S43, which is reproduced in this paragraph, provides that the presiding officor shall order a police officer to arrest a voter charged with personation. 11 appears to us that it would bo out of accord with modern practice not to allow tho presiding officor an element of discretion in this matter, and we have accordingly substituted &quot;may&quot; for &quot;shall.&quot;Section S9 of the same Act provides an elaborate code under which, if the justices are satisfied that the charge of personation is unfounded, they must order compensation to bo paid by the agent on whose complaint the
charge was made, which may be levied by distress on his goods, or on the goods of his principal. This codo also appears to us to bo out of accord with modern criminal procedure, and wo aro satisfied that if, as wo havo suggested, the presiding officer is allowed to use his discretion, tho section may properly bo ropealod without ro-onactmont.Paragraph 43. Tho Ballot Act, 1872, provides for tho retention of docu-monts relating  to an oloction for a poriod of ono year. Wo understand that it would bo of groat convenionco to local authorities if this poriod were reduced, and as petitions questioning an election aro normally required to bo presented within a period of twenty-one days after tho election wo have substituted &quot; six months &quot; for &quot; a year &quot; in this paragraph.Part IV.Form C. Tho Ballot Act requires tho person taking tho declaration to read Section 4 of tho Act to tho declarant beforo taking the declaration. We have provided in this Form that tho declarant should himself read tho eorre-sponding provision of tho Schedule.THIRD SCHEDULE. Part I.Paragraph 2. Sub-paragraph (3) (a) of this paragraph, which reproduces paragraph 5 of tho Second Schedule to the Municipal Corporations Act. 1882, omits tho requirement that tho notico of a meeting (other than ono called by members of tho council) is to be signed by tho chairman of tho council. It is thought that this requirement is unnecessary and in practice inconvenient.In sub-paragraph (3) ( /), the requirement of tho Act of 18S2 that notices of meeting must bo sent by registered post has been omitted.Part II.Paragraph 1. Under the oxisting law the annual meeting must be held at twelve noon. It has been represented to us by the Association of Municipal Corporations that it would bo convenient if some latitude wero allowed in the matter of the time of meeting, and we have accordingly provided that the council may fix some hour other than noon, if they think fit.Paragraph 2. In sub-paragraph (2) the words &quot; or by one quarter of the wholo number of the members of the council whichever is the less &quot; have been inserted to meet the caso of small boroughs.With regard to sub-paragraph (3), see the Note on paragraph 2 of Part 1 of this Schedule.Part III.Paragraph 1. Under Section 199 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as applied to district councils by Section 59 of the Local Government Act, 1894, district councils are required to meet monthly. Difficulty is often experienced in arranging meetings during tho months of tho summer vacation, and in practice councils commonly do not adhere strictly to the law. Sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph provides (as in the case of county and borough councils) for a minimum number of four meetings in tho year. It is the usual practice for borough councils to meet more frequently than this (usually once a month), and there is no reason to suppose that tho alteration will affect the actual practice of district councils, except in so far as it enables them to dispense with a meeting in August or September.Under the existing law, the annual meeting of a district council must be held as soon as may be convenient after the 15th day of April,   Newly-
157elected councillors come into ofiico on the 15th April, nnd if that date happens to fall on tho council&apos;s usual day of mooting thoy would be entitled to attend the meeting, but tho meeting could not bo treated as tho annual mooting of the council. This is plainly inconvenient, and accordingly tho paragraph provides for tho annual mooting being hold on or as soon as convenient uftor tho 15th April.Paragraph 2. Undor tho oxisting law there aro no provisions relating to the convening of meetings of district councils, but tho First Schedule to tho Public Health Act, 1875, requires theso councils to make regulations on this subject. Tho Clause assimilates tho law to that in Parts I and II of the tichedulo relating to county and borough councils.Paragraph G. Undor Rule 6 of tho First Schedule to the Public Health Act, 1S75, tho names of persons voting for and against resolutions must bo recorded in tho minutes of the meeting. This requirement involves the expenditure of considerable time and trouble, but it is necessary, in some cases, in ordor to enable tho responsibility for an improper payment to bo fixed on the members who supported tho resolution authorising tho payment. The paragraph retains tho requirement, but only in cases whero a member of tho council requires a record to bo mado.Part IV.Paragraph 1. By Section 1 (5) of the Parish Councillors (Tenure of Ofiico) Act, 1S99, a parish council is required to hold an annual meeting &quot;on or within seven days of the 15th day of April.&quot; It has been argued that this provision enables the meeting to be held during tho seven days preceding that date, but as this would involve tho mooting taking placo immediately before fhe newly-elected councillors came into offico, tho word &quot; of &quot; has been altered to &quot; after.&quot;Paragraph 2. Tho provisions of tho Local Government Act, 1894, as regards convening meetings of parish councils, havo been assimilated to thoso in Paris I, II and III of this Schedule, except that (following the existing law) two members of the parish council are entitled to require a meeting to be called.Paragraph 3. The Local Government Act, 1894, does not deal with the possible caso of the absence of the chairman and vice-chairman from a meeting of the parish council. Tho Clauso assimilates tho law in this respect to that applicable to district councils see paragraph 3 of Part Iff of this Schedule.Paragraph 5. Following the course adopted as to recording the names of the members voting at a meeting of a district council (see Note on paragraph G of Part III) it is proposed that the names of the parish councillors voting should only be recorded if a member of the parish council requires a record to be made.Part V.Paragraph 2. This paragraph, which reproduces provisions of tho Public Health Act, 1875, and tho Local Government Act, 1894, does not, under tho existing law, apply to county and borough councils. We think that tho law might with advantage bo assimilated in this respect.Paragraph 4. County councils, borough councils and parish councils are empowered to make standing orders for the regulation of their proceedings. In tho caso of district councils the Public Health Act, 1875, provides for regulations being mado.   The paragraph adopts the former expression.Paragraph 6. Under Section 1 (2) of the Audit (Local Authorities) Act, 1927, tho quorum of a local authority is to be determined by reference to the number of actual members of the authority, and not to the full number of members, whero more than one-third of the members are disqualified by
reason of surcharge Cases In which more than ono-third of tho number or members will bo simultaneously disqualified for other reasons will no doubt bo raro, but thoro appears to bo no roason why a similar provision should not apply if and when thoy occur, and wo havo accordingly widened the law in this paragraph to cover such cases.Part VI.Paragraph 2. Under tho existing law tho chairman of a parish meeting for a parish with no soparato parish council holds offico for ono year only. If his term of offico lapses boforo tho annual assembly of the parish mooting is hold, tho only persons capablo of convening tho mooting are six local government olectors. This frequently results in no annual mooting beini; held during tho month of March, as required by the Local Government Act, 1807. If, as is provided in Clauso 49 of tho Bill, tho term of office of the chairman is extended until his successor is elected, tho difficulty will be partly met, but thoro will still bo cases whore tho chairman is dead or absent, or othorwiso incapablo of convoning a mooting. Tho paragraph accordingly provides that a mooting may bo convened by any person representing the parish on tho rural district council.Paragraph 5.   Soo paragraph 59 of tho Report.FOURTH SCHEDULE.(Attention is drawn to paragraph 88 of tho Report.)Paragraph \. This paragraph reproduces paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of tho Eighth Schedule to tho Local Government Act, 1929, and provides for the procoduro for making and dealing with tho claim. We aro satisfied that the circumstances under which claims are mado vary so widely as to make it impracticable to stato within reasonable limits of spaco what particular.-, tho claimant should furnish ; and as this is a matter of administrative inach-inory we havo provided for tho particulars being prescribed.Paragraph 3. Paragraph 10 of tho Eighth Schedule to tho Act of 1929 provides for compensation being payable by way of either an annual stun or a capital sum. In view of tho provisions for suspension or reduction of compensation contained in paragraph 10 of this Schedule, the payment of a capital sum, oxcept in the caso of small amounts, is open to obvious objection, and wo understand that in practice the Minister of Health declines to sanction loans for this purposo except in special cases. The paragraph accordingly provides that lump-sum payments shall bo limited to sums not exceedintr  100.   This substantially represents the existing practice.Paragraph 4. Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) reproduce the Treasury practice, with the additional factors contained in paragraplis 1(d) and 1(e) of tho Eichth Schedule to tho Act of 1929.Sub-paragraph (3) is based on the provisions of proviso (ii) to Section 7 of tho Local Governmont and other Officers&apos; Superannuation Aot, 1922, which provides that for the purpose of calculating the superannuation allowance of a full-timo officer who has formorly served as a part-time officer, the period of part-time service shall bo treated as though it were whole-timo service for a proportionately reduced period.Paragraph 5. This paragraph represents the Treasury practice, an.l incorporates the proviso to paragraph 5 of tho Eighth Schedule to the Act of 1929.Paragraph 6. This paragraph deals with tho case of an officor who has not lost his offico but whose emoluments aro diminishod, and providos that his maximum compensation is to be arrived at (a) by estimating what the compensation would have been if ho had lost office, and (6) by giving him a
sum bearing tho somo proixsrtion to that amount os tho amount of tho reduction in his emoluments bears to tho emoluments he received before tho reduction.Paragraph 10. Sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph deals with tho case of an ofiiccr in receipt of compensation who subsequently becomes entitled to receive n superannuation allowance  in respect of tho samo period of service as that for which compensation is boing paid. Undor paragraph 11 of tho Eighth Schodulo to tho Act of 1929 such an officor would havo had his superannuation allowance roducod. Such-a provision is out of placo in a codo dealing, not with superannuation, but with compensation. We have accordingly substituted a reduction of tho compensation for a roduction of tho superannuation allowance .Paragraph 11. This paragraph is now, and has been inserted in order to secure uniformity in tho matter of tho form of notices, statements, otc.SIXTH SCHEDULE.Paragraph 1. This paragraph follows tho Public Works Facilities Act, 1930 (First Schedulo, Part II, paragraph 1, proviso) in enabling tho Minister of Health to direct tho exclusion from tho compulsory purchase order of Section 133 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845. That section requires tho promoters of tho undertaking to mako good deficiencies in the assessment for land tax and poor rate (now, by virtuo of Section 2 (7) of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, the general rate) duo to tho taking and uso of tho lands. In somo Acts giving local authorities powors of compulsory purchase Section 133 is excluded by tho Act itself (Housing Act, 1925, Section 131); in others, not. Tho question whother it should bo excluded or not depends in part on whother tho &quot; promoters &quot; ore thomsolves tho ratine authority, and tho m03t convenient course appears to bo to ompower the Minister to excludo or to direct exclusion in suitable cases.PrInUd under the authority of His SliJESTVs Statioxkkt Ofticb Uy Wyraans London Printing Co., Ltd., 93, Long Acre, W.C.2. 3/33. 5CSS.
