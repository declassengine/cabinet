I 3hould like to have authority to malK an announcement, probably in answer to aPrivate ITotioe Question on V.redne sday, 12th April, in thefollowing terns:-negotiations which took place with the German Government in Berlin before Ohristmas have recently been resumed in London.     I an happy to be able to announce that an arrangement has been arrived at, and is now awaiting formal signature, by virtue of which the German Government have agreed to increase materially the quoia of United &apos; Kingdom ooal which is permitted to be imported into Germany. In return for this it will be incumbent on us to reduce some rates of duty leviable in this country on a certain number of articles in which Germany is specially interested.Until the neoessary resolutions are introduced into and passed by the House of 0omnon3, it would obviously be impossible to announce the particular reductions of duty whioh the Agreement contemplates nor consequently the increase in the German quota for United Kingdom coalo   I am satisfied that the Agreement i3 one which oan fairly bs regarded as of mutual advantage to the two countries concerned.WoRoBoard of Trade,11th April, 1953*
ANGLO-GERMAN -The draft agreement, of which a copy is annexed, between H.M. Governmont and the Gorman Government concedes on the one hand certain specified rates of duty in the United Kingdom on a list of articles of German origin and on the other hand an increase in the quantity of United Kingdom coal allowed to enter Germany under the German coal quota schome.     The history of the negotiations which led up to this agreement is, shortly, that restrictions had been placed by the German Government on the importation of United Kingdom coal in circumstances which led H.M. Government to contend that there was involved a breach of the Anglo-German Treaty 1924 and of an unpublished letter from the head of the German Foreign Office to Lord D&apos;Abernon written at tho time when the Troaty was concluded.      On the other side there was a complaint on the part of the German Government that certain duties imposed upon German goods in this country were contrary to the undertakings contained in the Protocol to the Anglo-German Treaty 1924.     The two complaints were originally quite unrelated to one another but it was agreed after consider-able correspondence that the simplest way of arriving at an amicable settlement was to attempt to negotiate a concession to the United Kingdom on coal against concessions to Germany on certain of the tariff items in question.2. The discussions were commenced in Berlin early in December last and were brought to a conclusion a few days ago.    Licences are at present issued in Germany for the importation into the Customs area of 100,000 tons of coal or coke a month from the United Kingdom.    By the suggested agreement the United Kingdom would receive licences to Import a minimum quantity of 180,000 tons of coal or coke a month into the German Customs area.    In addition it is provided that if. the consumption of coal in Germany rises, imports from the United Kingdom shall rise in the same proportion.,    If, however, consumption decreases tho United Kingdom quota can
IDnot be reduced &quot;below 180,000 tons.     Details as to the calculation of German consumption and other matters of the same kind are dealt with in correspondence exchanged between the Mines Department and the German Ministry of Commerce.3. An important point with regard to coal is that imports into German free ports and imports for the use of ships as bunkers are to remain - as they are at present - free of restriction.4. The Mines Department are confident that the whole of the Sxtra allocation of coal can be used and that if the agreement is brought into force there will be a certain gain of 80,000 tons a month in the export of United Kingdom coal and the possibility of further gain if German consumption improves.     An extra 80,000 tons of coal a month means the employment of about 3,800 miners and will, of course, give a substantial volume of additional employment to auxiliary services, mainly transport.   An improvement in German consumption will increase employment pro rata.6* The concessions to be given by the United Kingdom are shown in the Schedule to the Agreement.     It will be observed that the proposed tariff changes relate in a great part to goods which at present bear duties which are higher than the duties normally imposed in our tariff on manufactured goods;    a number of them are to some extent luxury duties.     This applies to the Finance Act duties on clocks and musical instruments, and to the duties under the Import Duties Act on toys, jewellery, fur skins, and powder bowls or boxes, and powder puffs.     The remaining items in the list (hollow-ware, safety razor blades, acetic acid, tartaric acid, acetone and formaldehyde) are regarded as ox great importance by the German representatives because they feel it would be difficult to recommend the agreement in their country unless it contained some concession to certain important trades, e.g. the Solingen cutlery trade in regard to safety razor blades, and the chemical trade in regard to the acids and acetone.-f -3-
5. The duties on musical instruments and clocks have been in force almost continuously lor some 18 years.      In that period the home makers of some musical instruments (pianos in particular) have obtained a much stronger position in the home market, and there is no recent experience to show how far Germany is likely to regain this trade if the duty is reduced.      On the other hand the home production of clocks has made little progress until recently,  and the danger in reducing the duty is in the main one of arresting any expansion that might take place in the future.7. The effect of a tariff reduction on the volume of imports and therefore on employment in the United Kingdom can seldom be estimated with any exactness, and for a variety of reasons it is exceptionally difficult to estimate the effect of the changes now proposed.     Many of the duties have been in force for less than a year, and it has not, therefore, been possible to obtain much experience oi the effect of these duties in restricting imports or stimulating home production.     idoreover other influences have during that period been affecting the normal course of trade;    industrial depression has reduced the demand for some of the goods included in the schedule, and the depreciation of sterling has also no doubt, in regard to goods imported from Germany, had a substantial effect in reducing imports.      In estimating the effect of the duties on the volume of import trade it has been assumed in general that about one-third of the reduction in imports which has occurred since 1931 can be attributed to factors other than the tariff.8. In the table attached an attempt is made to estimate the extent to which the proposed reductions of duty may be expected to lead to an increase in imports and a loss of employment in the United Kingdom.      The change in revenue to be expected   on ths same assumption regarding increase in imports is also indicated.      It will be appreciated however that it is
17extremely difficult to forecast thcj results of those changes and the figures in this table are raerelj&apos; the best conjectures that can be made in the circumstances.     A close estimate can be made of the employment that would be afforded by the   German offer  to admit JO,000 tons of coal a month;    it would afford work here for 3,800 miners.     It will be seen that the estimate ox the effect of our tariff changes is that it will lead to an increase in imports of some  S40,000 a year, a loss of employment for some 2,500 men, and a loss of revenue of some  120,000 a year.9. Most of these reductions of duty can be made by Order under the Import Duties Act;    those affecting the duties on musical instruments and clocks will require legislation.    It will not therefore be possible to bring the agreement into force at once;    it is provided in the agreement that it shall come into force as soon as possible after the necessary legislative changes can be made.     Short notes on the separate trades are appended.

NOTES ON TRADES AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED TARIFF CHANGES. Toys.   Until 1938 imports of toys exceeded home production, hut recently there has been a substantial improvement in toy production in the United Kingdom.    It is understood that a number of new factories have been established,  some of them by German intereets8    Imports of toys (other than rubber toys) declined from  8,300,000 in 1931 fo  1,100,000 in 1932.    Home production in 1930 amounted to about .31,600,000.Christmas Tree Decorationsc    The German statistics show exports to the United Kingdom valued at 850,000 Marks in 1931 to 364,000 Marks in 1932.    Some production has been started in the United Kingdom In recent months, but it is not thought yet to have attained any considerable dimensions.Pianos, non-automatic.    Imports in 1932 were valued at only  19,000, while home production in 1930 was valued at about  1,500,000*   Probably the use of pianos is declining, and it is exceptionally difficult to forecast the effect of the reductiontof duty on this trade.Vind Instrument So   The instruments named in the proposal for tariff reductions are understood to be those for which Germany has the largest share of the trade.    Imports of all wind instruments in 1932 were valued at  67,000 of which  27,000 came from Germany. Home production in 1930 was valued at  159,000oString Instruments.    Imports in 1938 from all countries were valued at  37,000 and from Germany at  22,000.    Home production in 1930 was valued at  48,000.Gramophones.    Imports of gramophones .0f the kind referred to in these proposals were in 1938 valued at  2,700.   Home production in 1930 was valued at over  8,000,000.Concertinas and Mouth Organs.    It is understood that mouth organs and the cheaper concertinas are not made in the United Kingdom,Clocks.    Imports of clocks fell from  709,000in 1931 to
^510,000 in 193?.    Tho decline-in purchasing power is no doubt partly responsible for this fall, but an oxpanslon-ofhome industry has contributed nla  ,    A nutb er of British firms are making the newer electric clocks (on which the duty is not being reduced) , and  there has been son-; increase hero in tho production of mechanical clocks.    Little or no progress h^s yot bjen made here in the production of the cheaper alarm clocks of which large numbers are imported from Germany.For this industry it is difficult to make any estimate of tho future trend of tho import tr: ue, whether or not the duty is reduced.    It is quite possible that clocks ffctuntea i&apos;rom the electric mains will largely displPce other types of clocks in the near future,  and in thst   ;vont the effect of tho proposed reduction in auty might be small.&apos;The British clocknakers have been hoping to obtain a larger share of the tr^de in cheap mechanical cl- cks,  and have applied on several occasions during the past year for an increase in the existing duty of 33^.Jewellery.    It appears that until it became subject to duty a considerable part of our imports of jewellery was not recorded in our import statistics either because it was entered under some other heading such as fancy goods, or because it was imported by parcel post and was not therefore classified unaer the usual tr^de headings.    Tho German statistics show exports to the United Kingdom valued at 9,000,000 I larks in 1931, and 3,600,000 Harks in It3?..    Home production in 1950 of jewellery not of gol^. or platinum was valued at  680,000.Fur skins. The G-orutn representatives were not concerned to obtain a reduction of duty on finished garments of fur so much as on dressed skins or parts of skins sown together to form linings or trimmings of garments.    These are wholly or mainly mrterial for the home garment-making Industry and a reduced rate of duty seems not inappropriate.    The duty on dressed fur skins is lofj and on manufactures of furskins is 30^.
V/rought Enamelled Hollow-ware.    Those goods are subject to a safeguarding duty of 25ft until June, 1935, when they will automatically become subject to a duty under the Import Duties Act of 20ft.    Imports in 1930 fell to only  49,000;   before the safeguarding duty was imposed they amounted to some  500,000 a year.Safety-Razor Blades. Prom May, 1938, until July,1952, these goods were subject to a duty of 80ft nd vclorem.    This duty was, on the recommendation qi the Advisory Committee, increased by the addition to the ad valorem duty of a specific duty of S/-d a gross.   When making this recommendation the Committee said that &quot;subject to the adequate development of the industry tnd the pursuance of a strongly competitive policy, we do not contemplate recommending any alteration in the rate of duty now proposed for a period of five years.&quot;In 1931 imports amounted to  415,000 or an average of  55,000 per month.    During the months when the auty was 20ft ad valorem imports were at quite a low level, and since then they have been at the rate of about  2,000 to  3,000 per month.    The existing duty is equivalent to about 7Of5 ad valorem, and the duty now proposed is equivalent to about 45ft ad valorem.Acetic Acid.   Most of our imports of acetic acid are subject to Key Industry Duty,  and it is not proposed to reduce the duty on those grades of ccid.    The German Government are anxious to obtain some relief from the existing duty of 33^ on acid produced by their wood distillation industries; until 1930 this acid was not subject to duty at all in the United Kingdom, Imports from Germany in 1931 amounted to about  25,000.     Most of our imports of acetic acid come from Canada.Acetone.   As in the case of ccetic acid a large part of our imports will remain subject to Key Industry Duty,  and only acetone made by wood dietillation is affected by this proposal.
Imports of thin uaterial from vt-serious countrico in 1951 amounted to about .*60,000.Tartaric Acid.    This materiel vas not subject to uuty until 1952, and the duty of 20;: has very largely reduced imports!    Germany is by f.-r the largest supplier.Formaldehyde.   Production of thin arterial in the United Kingdom increased rapidly when it was imported free i duty and imports declined from :?87,600 in 1*:31 to -,7,900 in 1938.
DRAFT 3XCHANGJ! OF ITOTJ3. Sir,I have the honour to inform your Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared to undertake to take the necessary steps to secure that the articles enumerated in the Schedule annexed to this note produced or manufactured in Germany shall not on importation into the United Kingdom he subjected to duties or charges other or higher than those specified in the Schedule, on condition that the German Government secure (l) that licences shall be issued for the importation into the German Customs ,-i.rea of coal and coke produced in the United Kingdom up to an amount -which shall in no case be less than 180,000 metric tons a month (for this purpose a ton of coice shall be reckoned as equal to a ton of coal), and (2) that if the total consumption in Germany of coal, coal briquettes and coite exceeds by one per cent, or more the equivalent of 7,500,000 metric tons of coal in any month, licences shall be issued for the importation into the German Customs area in the second month following of an amount of coal and coke produced in the United Kingdom which exceeds 180,000 metric tons by the same percentage as the said total German consumption exceeds 7,500,000 metric tons.     Such detailed arrangements as may be necessary (including the method of calculating the increased importation to be/allowed
allowed in any month) shall be agreed between the Reichswirtschaftsministerium and the Mines Department.The two Governments will bring the Agreement into operabion by mutual arrangement so soon as possible after a notification has been given by   His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to the German Ambassador in London that they are in a position to bring it into operation.    It shall continue in force until the expiration of three months from the date on which either Government sha-11 have given notice of their intention to terminate it.If the arrangement herein proposed meets with the approval of the German Government this note,  and a reply from your Excellency notifying the acceptance of this proposal by the German Government, will constitute an agreement between the two Governments to this effect.I have the honour, etc.
