[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1933.Copy No.    ILVCABINET.Proposed Initiation of Preliminary Discussions, with a Yiew to a Resumption   of Negotiations for  an Anglo-egyptian treaty Settlement.Question of future Location of the British Forces in Egypt.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.A copy is attached of a telegram sent to the Government of India on 21st April asking for their views on the proposals in the Foreign Office letter of loth April, No. J. 925/G., and of the Government of India&apos;s reply of 27th April. It will be seen that the Government of India deprecate the complete withdrawal of the British forces from the vicinity of Cairo to the east line 32 degrees, unless His Majesty&apos;s Government find that no treaty can be negotiated on any other basis.For my own part, I fully recognise the desirability of a treaty settlement with Egypt, as I presume that it may become more and more difficult to resist her claim to be admitted to the League of Nations, and once she became a member of the League it is difficult to see how, except on the basis of a treaty, we could justify the presence of British troops in Egypt at all. Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s present Government seems to have an opportunity, which may not recur, of securing a not unsatisfactory treaty settlement, especially now that the Egyptian Government, backed by King Euad, is favourably disposed towards us.On the other hand, though I am not convinced that it would not be possible, in the last resort, to defend the Canal from the Canal zone, I realise that this task would be made much more difficult by the removal of our troops from Cairo. When I was a member of the C.I.D. Committee that considered this question in 1927, it seemed to me that the most difficult problem was that of the water supply of the troops. If this water supply can be ensured, I should be inclined to agree to the withdrawal from Cairo, provided that it can be shown that such a step is really essential to the prospect of obtaining a treaty. The Foreign Office will no doubt recognise the need for extreme caution in the preliminary discussions, and the necessity of obtaining as many safeguards as are possible. I would suggest that, while we should, in the last resort, refrain from sacrificing the chances of a treaty upon the question of the Cairo garrison, our ropi-esentatives should be instructed, in entering into any preliminary discussions that may be sanctioned, to bear prominently in mind the advantages of retaining our troops in their present locations, and, if this should prove to be impracticable, of trying to secure the largest possible zone as u pis aller.In view of the grave issues that are involved and of the vital interest that is taken in them by the Service Departments, the India Office and the Dominions, I consider that the negotiations should take place in London.India Office, S. 11.d tli May 1933.Telegram from Secretary of Slate to Government of India, Foreign and PoliticalDepartment, dated 21s/ April 1933.989. Most secret. Walton&apos;s personal letter to Metcalfe, dated 3rd November, PZ. 6031/32.   Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations.2. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposes very shortly to submit proposals to Cabinet for initiation of preliminary discussions in Cairo between His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner and Egyptian Prime Minister, with a view to resumption of negotiations.3. Discussions would turn on two most important points at issue, viz. :  (a) Future location of British forces in Egypt ; and (6) Future administration ol&apos; Sudan. 1859      GO   5.33SECRET.CP. 119 (33).
-J. As regards (a), it is intended to secure if possible following important modili-catious of terms offered in 1930 (Command Paper .3575): (1) Transfer of land aud air forces to Suez Canal zone would be to locations chosen by them main concentration of land forces being on west side of Great Bitter Lake, aud of air forces in neighbourhood of Ismailia.(2) Absolute freedom of movement of British Service aircraft.(3) Egypt&apos;s assistance as an ally to be available, not merely in time of war, but in the wide range of contingencies covered by following definition: &quot;In the event of imminent menace of war or of serious disturbance within the territories under the sovereignty or authority of His Britannic Majesty, or territories adjacent thereto, or in the event of a threat to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s essential com muni-cations.&quot;(4) No restriction on number of land and air forces to be maintained in contingencies contemplated in (3) above.(5) No provision for Egyptian troops on tlio Canal.(G) Definition in separate convention of privileges and immunities for British forces in Egypt.5. As regards (J)), intention is to maintain and even to strengthen relevant article of 1930 Draft, which secures in effect that future administration of Sudan shall be in British hands, with Egypt as sleeping partner. Following concessions are., however, proposed, with a view to encouraging Egypt to continue present financial subvention : (1) Periodic meetings of Nile Commission with powers of recommendation on all major issues affectiug Nile waters.(2) Acceptance of Egyptian Agent at Khartoum with status and functions corresponding to those of Sudan Agent in Cairo.G. No decision has yet been reached on these proposals, and Service Departments are still reluctant to agree to removal of troops from the cities or their suburbs, but it is hoped that Cabinet decision-may be reached before end of April, so that High Commissioner may be instructed before bis return to Cairo, and 1 shall be glad of very early expression of your views.7. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considers that failure to respond to long-continued Egyptian pressure for resumption of negotiations must result in virtual abandonment of policy outlined in Declaration of 1922, and would entail risk of nationalist movement in Egypt similar to that of immediate post-war period, aud that arguments for delay, although cogent, have already been developed to fullest degree which is either reasonable or safe.Telegram from Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 27th April 1933.10G6. Your telegram of the 21st instant, 989. Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations.2. From our point of view essential object to be secured is free passage for British shipping through the Canal in all circumstances both in peace and war. This can only be secured if the Canal is protected from all possibility of successful hostile action, and such protection must, we consider, be afforded for indefinite period by British troops and Royal Air Force. We are assured by our military advisers that complete withdrawal from vicinity of Cairo to east of line 32 degrees would create a position strategically unsound and one from which protection of the Canal zone would not be effective in spite of the safeguards now proposed, and we are unable, therefore, to recommend that this should be agreed to unless His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment find that no treaty can bo negotiated on any other basis.3. Apart from this, we welcome changes now proposed in the draft Treaty as explained in paragraph 4 (2), (3), (4), (5) and (G) of your telegram.4. With proposed arrangements for Sudan we are not really concerned and offer no comments.
