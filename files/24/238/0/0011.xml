Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1933.SECRET.CP.  42  (33).                                 CABINET.THE FAR EAST AND  GENEVA.     1.   THE long-drawn-out efforts at Geneva  to establish an agreed basis for conciliation between China and Japan have definitely failed, and, in consequence,it has become the duty of  the  League, under paragraph 4 of Article XV,  to&quot;make and publish a  report containing a statement of the facts  of the disputeand the  recommendations which are deemed just and proper in regard thereto.&quot;The Committee of Nineteen, on which Mr. Eden has been representing the BritishGovernment in recent weeks, has just completed its task of drawing up the draft report, and  this report comes  before the Special  Assembly  for adoption  on tuesday.  The report  is unanimous  and  the  Times  correspondent  telegraphsthat at  Geneva it &quot;is considered to be a  good, honest  document of  which theLeague will not need  to be ashamed.&quot;   I agree wdth this view.  The reportfollows the line wdiich  I have more than once explained to the  Cabinet and have indicated  to  both  China  and Japan  as  inevitable if conciliation failed.    in substance, the League  pronouncement is in accordance with the Lytton Report,and we  have  eonsistentty maintained  at Geneva that,  if  it became necessary  toproceed  under paragraph 4 of Article XV,  the contents of the  Lytton report would necessarily be regarded as holding the field, for there is no rival accountof these  matters which could possibly challenge its authority.     2.   The  part  of the report  wdiich  requires  the special  attention  of theCabinet  is Part IV, which contains recommendations.   This declares against&quot; a mere return to the  status quo existing before September 1931  &quot; and this is.of  course,  an  implied  condemnation  of  the  previous   Chinese  regime.Coupled  with this,   is  a pronouncement  against  &quot; the  maintenance  andrecognition   of   the   existing   regime   in  Manchuria,  such   maintenance and  recognition  being  incompatible  wdth  the  fundamental  principles  ofexisting    international  obligations  and   a   good  understanding   betweenthe two countries on which peace in the Far East depends.&quot;   Both these propo-sitions are lifted practically bodily from the Lytton Report itself.   There follows,however,  a  further recommendation  on  the   subject  of non-recognition  ofManchukuo, to which I would  ask special attention.    3.  This  recommendation runs thus :         &quot; It follows that, in adopting the present report,  the Members of the  League intend  to    abstain, particularly as  regards the existing regime in Manchuria, from  any act which might    prejudice or delay the carrying out of the recommendations of the said report.   They will    continue not to recognise this regime either dc jure or de  facto.  They intend to abstain from    taking any  isolated action with regard to the  situation in Manchuria and to  continue to    concert their action among themselves as well as with the interested States not  Members of    tho League.       &quot; As regards the Members of the League who are signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty,    it may  be recalled that,  in accordance with the provision of  that Treaty: &apos; Whenever a    situation arises  which,  in the opinion of  any one of them, involves the application  of the    stipulations  of the present Treaty, and renders desirable discussion of such application, there    shall be full and frank communication between the contracting Powers concerned.&apos; &quot;As  to this very  important recommendation,  the following  points  should  benoted :       (1) The  members  of  the  League are  already committed  to  a unanimous           resolution adopted last  March  in connection  with the Manchuria           trouble to the effect that it was incumbent upon them not to recognise       [8242]Copy No.40
           any situation, treaty, or agreement brought about by means contrary           to the Covenant or the Kellogg Pact.  This formula was largely the           result of communications between myself  and Mr. Stimson  at  the           time and had the result of putting ourselves in line with the United           States on the matter.  The  present  recommendation is therefore an           application to  the  ascertained subject matter of  this preliminary           declaration.    (2) I have always been anxious lest the hot-heads of Geneva, most of whom           have no practical concern with  the  Far East  at  all,  should  try to           impose upon the  Great Powers  a decision which  would  amount to           declaring  that  non-recognition  was decreed  in   perpetuity.   The           direction of British foreign  policy cannot  be surrendered  to  the           League in that  way, and, in any  case,  it would not be open to us to           bind future Governments for an indefinite length of time.  I consider,           however, that the formula that members of the League &quot; will continue           not to recognise&quot; is not open to the above objection, and, indeed, it was           I that suggested this form of words.  If circumstances changed and           Manchukuo really establishes itself as an independent  entity whose           inhabitants wish to be  separated  from  China, we can reconsider our           position.    (3) The declaration that members  of the League &quot; intend to  abstain from           taking  any isolated action &quot; is also, I think,  defensible and can be           accepted.  Assuming that, in course  of time, a  situation arose which           called for reconsideration of the decision not to recognise,  we  should           certainly communicate our view to other States interested before acting           alone.  If a situation arose in which British  interests  and changed           circumstances really necessitated recognition, we have not bound our           hands by joining in the declaration that the members of the League           intend to continue to concert their action amongst themselves.    4.  The importance of this is greatly increased by the fact that the UnitedStates and Soviet Russia  are not  members  of  the League.   The  Cabinet willnotice that the recommendation speaks of concerting action with non-members.I have already asked  the United States Government whether they  are preparedto respond favourably  to a request for  continued  co-operation (telegram No. 92to Washington of the 16th  February), and the State Department has replied thatthe United States were most anxious to continue  to co-operate, but that they must await  the  adoption of the League report by  the Assembly before  expressingapproval.  It goes without saying that, if hereafter an important foreign Govern-ment  gained advantages for its citizens by recognising Manchukuo, we  should at.once consider this a serious ground for revising our own position.    5.  Mr. Eden is returning  to Geneva with the intention  of expressing theacceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the  report as it stands, and I  should like to be  assured  that the  attitude of  the Foreign Office  in  this  respect is approved.  I think that we should resist changes in the report in either direction and we shall be in  a much stronger position to vote  against amendments if weshow  ourselves  prepared to stand by the work of the Committee of Nineteen andurge the adoption of  the report as it stands. Mr. Eden  is hopeful that  if theGreat Powers  take their  stand firmly  on the  draft  report  it will go throughwithout changes.                          ^    6.  It is now  necessary to look into the future and consider what develop-ments may take place in regard to which decisions will have to be  taken by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.  I  do not  think that final decisions on every  detail  canbe taken in advance, but I submit the following broad reflections to the Cabinet:     (1) There must be no resort to economic or other sanctions under Article XVI.           At  any  rate, we  must, if necessary, dissociate ourselves  from  any           such proposal.   The point is so plain that it does not need argument           here.  Sanctions under  Article XVI are  quite inconceivable  in the           present issue.    (2) This, however, does not mean that no proposals are likely to be made for           modified forms of pressure.  It  will  be  said  that the members of           the League have,  in effect, declared that Japan has broken the rules
APPENDIX.    THE Executive Committee of the League of Nations Union recently passedand notified  to the  Foreign  Office  on  the  13th  February the  followingresolution :          &quot; That it is the opinion of the Executive Committee of the League of    Nations Union  that, where a dispute between  two nations has  been  the    subject of a decision or report by the League of Nations  and  that  decision    or report  has been accepted by one of the parties to the dispute and is refused    by the other, it is  incompatible with the obligations of the Covenant and the    Kellogg Pact that nations. Members  of the League and/or signatories of    the Pact, should allow the export of arms to the country in default.         &quot; That the Executive Committee urges His  Majesty&apos;s Government to    seek the assent  of the Powers signatories of the Covenant and/or the Pact    to an international agreement to this effect.&quot;      of the League and that,  if she continues to break them by extended      military operations against China, members of the League ought not      to continue to permit their citizens to supply Japan with munitions      of war.   There are already indications that this issue will be raised      in Parliament and  I understand that Sir Austen  Chamberlain  has      drawn up a resolution,(&apos;) which has been unanimously accepted by the      Executive of the League of Nations Union, in favour of a general rule      that it is inconsistent with the obligations of the Covenant  and the      Kellogg  Pact, for signatories of those Treaties to supply  arms to      nations which are breaking the Treaty.  No doubt the application of      any such rule by ourselves could only be contemplated if everyone else,      including the United States of America,  did the  like,  and I  have      recently  been told by the United States Government (in reply to an      enquiry in connection with the war between Bolivia and Paraguay)      that the  United States constitution does not permit the Executive to      restrict the export of arms.  But I am convinced that we shall be very      shortly challenged as to whether we would take this  course if  all other      countries producing or  dealing in armaments did the same, and a      Cabinet decision will be needed as to the reply which we should give.(3)  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador  at  Tokyo  reports that Japan is  likely to      resign  from  the League, but  it  remains to be seen  whether  this      prognostication is  verified.   Under  the terms  of  the Covenant no      member can withdraw until after two years&apos; notice  of its intention to      do so, and this interval gives  time  for reflection.   I do not believe      that the Japanese  Government wants to  withdraw,  but its public      opinion may  force it to give notice.   Although two years has  to elapse      before membership ceases, Japan may of course cease to attend, and if      she  accompanies this   with  withdrawal  from the  Disarmament      Conference,  the prospects of disarmament are  definitely worsened.      especially on the naval side.

APPEAL  OF THE  CHINESE GOVERNMENT.    DRAFT OF THE REPORT PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 15, PARAGRAPH 4. OF                              THE COVENANT.(Submitted by the Special Committee of the Assembly in Execution of Part III             (Paragraph 5) of the Resolution of March 11. 1932.)     Letter from the President of the Assembly to the Secretary-General.(Translation.)                                          February 15, 1933.    THE Special Committee of the Assembly (Committee of Nineteen) has foundthat, after endeavouring, in accordance with the task entrusted to it, to prepare the settlement of the dispute in agreement with the parties, it was unable to makeany proposals to the Assembly to this effect.  The efforts made with this end inview since the  Assembly adopted its resolution of the 9th December last are described in Part II (Section 15) of the attached draft report.    This draft has been prepared by the Committee of Nineteen  in execution ofthe task  entrusted to it by Part III (paragraph 5) of the Assembly resolution ofthe 11th March, 1932, under which the Committee, exercising its functions onbehalf of and under the supervision of the Assembly, was instructed to prepare,if need be, the  draft  of the report  provided for in article 15, paragraph 4, ofthe Covenant.    I should be glad if you would circulate this draft report to the Members ofthe Assembly, and inform them that, in virtue  of the powers conferred on me bythe last  paragraph of the  said resolution of the  11th  March, I request theAssembly to meet at Geneva on Tuesday, the 21st February, 1933, at 3-30 P.M.                                     (Signed)      PAUL  HYMANS,                                                President of the Assembly.[8245]B
                            DRAFT  REPORT.    The Assembly, in view of the failure of the efforts which, under article 15.paragraph 3, of the Covenant, it was its duty to make with a view to effecting asettlement of the dispute submitted for its  consideration under paragraph 9 ofthe said article, adopts,  in virtue  of paragraph 4 of that article, the following report containing  a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommenda-tions which are deemed just and proper in regard thereto.PART I. EVENTS  IN THE FAR EAST. ADOPTION  OF THE FIRST EIGHT CHAPTERS    OF THE REPORT OF  THE COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY. PLAN OF THE REPORT.    The underlying causes of  the  dispute  between China and Japan  are ofconsiderable complexity.  The Commission of Enquiry sent by  the Council to study the situation on the spot  expresses the view that the &quot; issues involved inthis conflict are not as simple as they  are often represented to be.  They  are, onthe contrary, exceedingly complicated,  and only an  intimate knowledge of all thefacts, as well as of their historical background, should  entitle anyone to express a definite opinion  upon them.&quot;(&apos;)    The first eight chapters of the report of the  Commission of Enquiry presenta balanced, impartial and detailed statement of the historical background of thedispute and of the main facts in so far as they relate to events in  Manchuria.It  would be both impracticable and superfluous  either  to  summarise  or torecapitulate the report of the  Commission of Enquiry, which has been publishedseparately; after examining the observations communicated by the Chinese and japanese Governments, the Assembly  adopts as  part of its own  report the firsteight chapters of the report of the Commission of  Enquiry.    It is necessary, however, to complete the statement of the  Commission ofEnquiry by describing the measures taken by the  Council and the Assembly inconnexion with the various phases of the dispute, as well as certain events, which do not appear in the report of the Commission, more particularly  those relatingto the origin of the hostilities  which occurred  at Shanghai at the beginningof 1932.  In regard to  these events,  the Assembly adopts  as part of its ownreport the reports addressed to it by the  Consular Commission of Enquiry.These reports have been published separately.(2)  The story  of what happened in manchuria since the beginning of September 1932 must also be related, since thereport of the Commission of Enquiry does not go beyond  that date.    This brief  historical summary  of the  development of  the  dispute will befound in Part II of the present  report. It should be read in connexion with thenarrative of events given in the report of the Commission of Enquiry.    Part III describes the chief characteristics of the dispute and the conclusionsdrawn by the Assembly from the essential facts.    Part IV contains the recommendations which the Assembly deems to  be just and proper in regard to the dispute.  PART II. DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISPUTE BEFORE THE  LEAGUE OF NATIONS.               1.  Summary of the Development  of the Dispute.    The decisions  of the Council and  of the Assembly  in the long period whichhas elapsed since the dispute was first brought before the League of Nations were determined by the evolution of the conflict in the Far East.    At the outset, the incidents  with which the Council were called upon  to dealwhen the dispute  was submitted  to it by China under  article  11 occurred atMukden and in some other places in Manchuria; the Council received repeatedassurances from Japan that she had no territorial designs in Manchuria and thatshe would  withdraw her  troops within  the South  Manchuria  Railway  zone,subject to the sole condition that the safety of the lives and property of Japanesenationals were  assured.  Such was  the  purport  of the  resolution   of the30th September and of  the  draft  resolution of the 24th  October,  1931.  The    (&apos;) Report of the Commission of Enquiry (document C.6(53.1932, page 12G).    (2) The first three reports of tho Consular Commission, with their supplements, are  given indocument A(Extr.).3.1932 and tho fourth report in document A(Extr.).15.1932.   They are alsoreproduced in the Special Supplement to the Official Journal No. 101, page 194,  et neq.
latter, which was agreed to by all the Members of the Council  except  Japan.enabled the Council once again to secure pledges from the Japanese delegation.     After the rejection of this draft resolution, Japan&apos;s insistence on the need ofa settlement of the fundamental questions which divided the two countries led theCouncil, without prejudice to the execution of the undertakings embodied in theresolution of the 30th September, to put forward measures with a  view to a finaland  fundamental solution by the two parties  of  the questions at issue betweenthem.  On the 10th December, 1931, the Council, acting on a proposal made by japan,  decided to appoint a Commission of five members with instructions tomake an enquiry on the spot and to report to the Council on &apos;&apos; any circumstancewhich, affecting international relations, threatens to disturb peace between Chinaand Japan, or the good understanding between them upon which peace depends.&quot;    Between December and March, however, there was  a considerable change forthe worse in the  situation  in  the  Far  Fast.  Japanese troops  completed theoccupation of South Manchuria and began to occupy North Manchuria. OutsideManchuria a severe conflict, involving Chinese and Japanese regular forces, wasbegun and carried on at Shanghai.  At the same time  the reorganisation of thecivil administration in those parts of Manchuria occupied by the Japanese troopsresulted in the formation of an &quot;independent State&quot; styled &quot;Manchukuo,&quot;which did not recognise Chinese sovereignty.  The Council was henceforth asked by China  to deal  with  the  dispute, not only  under article 11, but also underarticles 10 and 15 of the Covenant.  On the 19th February, 1932, as  the i&apos;result ofa request  by China submitted under  the terms of article 15. paragraph 9. theCouncil referred the dispute to the Assembly.    From January onwards, pending the receipt of the  report of the Commissionof Enquiry, without which the  substance of  the dispute could not be thoroughlyexamined, the  chief concern of the Council, and subsequently of  the Assembly.was to do everything in its power to stop hostilities and prevent an aggravationof the situation, while preserving the  rights  of the parties and the principles ofthe Covenant  from suffering prejudice by  reason  of  any fait accompli.  TheAssembly, by its resolution of the 11th March,  defined the attitude of the Leagueof Nations towards the dispute.  It declared  that,  pending  a  settlement inconformity with the Covenant, it was incumbent upon the Members of the Leaguenot to recognise any situation, treaty or agreement which might be brought about by means  contrary to the Covenant of the  League of Nations or  to the  pact of Paris.    The hostilities at Shanghai were brought to  an end, but fighting continued in Manchuria  between Japanese  forces or forces of the &quot;Manchukuo&apos;&apos; Govern-inent  and irregular  Chinese forces.  In September 1932. some days after the signing at Peiping of the report of  the Commission  of Enquiry,  there was afurther fundamental  change  in the  situation:  the  Japanese  government recognised the &quot;Manchukuo&quot; Government.    The report of the Commission of Enquiry could  not  reach  Geneva beforethe end of September namely, after the expiry of  the time-limit of six monthslaid down in the Covenant for the report of the Assembly under article 15.  TheAssembly, therefore, with the assent of the  parties, decided on the 1st July toextend the time-limit for as long as might  be strictly necessary,  on the  under-standing that such extension should not constitute a precedent.  The Commissionof Enquiry was thus able to complete its report on the spot, the parties to submit their observations on  the report, and  the Council and  Assembly to examine  allthe material thus  collected.    The examination of this material and the exchanges of views with the partiescontinued from the middle of November 1932 to the beginning of February 1933.After the discussions by the Council, the  Assembly endeavoured,  but without success, to bring  about  a settlement of the  dispute by negotiation  between theparties under  paragraph 3 of  article  15, on  the basis of the information and conclusions contained in the report of the Commission of Enquiry.  It has there-fore  adopted the  present report in conformity with paragraph 4 of that article..2.  Origin  of   the  Dispute  before  the   League of  Nations. Events  of    Sejrtember 18-19, 1931, in  South Manchuria. First Discussio?is  of  the    Council.    China&apos;s request to the Council arose out of the action taken by the japanese troops in Manchuria on the night of the 18th-19th September, 1931.      [8245]                                                     u 2
     In consequence of an incident near Mukden,(3) in the  South  ManchuriaRailway zone, which is guarded by Japanese troops, the Japanese command, onthe  ground  that  military  precautions were  necessary,  sent  troops  outside therailway zone, more especially to the Chinese towns in the neighbourhood of the zone, and  to the  Chinese  railway lines terminating at Mukden.  The  Chinesetowns of Mukden, Changchun, Antung, Yingkow and others were occupied andthe  Chinese troops dispersed or disarmed.     On the 21st  September, China appealed under article  11 of the Covenantand asked  the Council to take immediate steps to prevent the further development&apos;of a situation endangering  the peace of nations, to re-establish the status quo anteand to determine the amount and character of such reparations as might be founddue to the Republic of China.     On the 22nd  September the Council authorised its  President  (the represen-tafeive of Spain. M. Lerroux) : (1) to address an urgent appeal to the two Govern-ments to refrain from any act which might aggravate the situation or prejudice the  peaceful settlement of the  problem;  (2) to  seek, in  consultation with theChinese and Japanese representatives, adequate means whereby the two countries might proceed immediately to the withdrawal of  their respective troops, withoutcompromising the safety of the  lives and. property of their nationals.     On the 29th September the President-in-Office of the Council, explaining thesituation  to the Assembly  then  in ordinary  session, on the basis of  information supplied by the two parties, stated that &quot; the withdrawal of the Japanese forces to within  the South Manchuria Railway  zone was being carried out,&quot;  and  thaton  the 28th September &quot; the  Japanese  representative had  announced to theCouncil that the withdrawal was proceeding.....   Outside the railway zone,there  only  remained, apart from  Kirin and Mukden, small  detachments atHsinmin and Chengchiatun for the protection of Japanese nationals  against the attacks of bands of  Chinese soldiers and  brigands which at the same time wereravaging: those districts.&quot;     Such  was the position when, on the 30th September, the  Council  adopted the  following resolution :          &quot;The Council,         &quot; (1)  Notes the replies of the Chinese and Japanese Governments to the     urgent  appeal  addressed to them  by  its President, and the steps that have     already been taken in response to that appeal;         &quot; (2)  Recognises  the importance of the Japanese  Governments state-     ment  that it has no territorial designs in Manchuria;         &quot; (3)  Notes  the Japanese  representative^ statement that  his  Govern-     ment  will continue, as rapidly as possible, the withdrawal of its troops, which     has already been begun, into the  railway zone in proportion as the safety     of the lives and property of Japanese  nationals is effectively assured and that     it hopes to carry out this intention in full as speedily as may be;         &quot; (4)  Notes the Chinese representative^ statement that his Government     will   assume  responsibility  for the  safety  of the  lives  and  property of     Japanese nationals outside that zone as the withdrawal  of the  Japanese     troops  continues and  the  Chinese local authorities  and  police forces are     re-established;     (3) According to the appeal addressed  by  the  Chinese  Government  to the Council on September 21, 1931, &quot; beginning from 10 o&apos;clock on the night of September  18, regular troops of japanese soldiers, without provocation of any kind, opened  rifle and artillery fire upon Chinese soldiers at or near the city of Mukden, bombarded the arsenal and barracks, ....  set fire to the ammunition depot &quot; and &quot; disarmed the Chinese troopi in Changchun, Kwanchengtze, and other places&quot; (Official Journal, December 1931, page 2453).     According to the  version given by the Japanese army, communicated to the  Council on September  20, a patrol of seven men under a lieutenant were making reconnaissances in the railway zone north of Mukden when they heard behind them, about 10-30 P.M., a violent explosion. They turned about and some 500 metres northwards, near the  place at which the explosion hail occurred, they perceived Chinese soldiers in flight.  The patrol at first pursued them, but  found themselves  under fire from soldiers under cover and then from a force of some 400 or 500 Chinese troops.   The Japanese company commander promptly came up with 120 men, pursued the Chinese troops and occupied  part of the. Mukden  North Barracks (document C.621.1931; Official Jdurnal, December 1931, page 2478).     Chapter IV of tho report of the Commission of  Enquiry sots out in detail the events that occurred during the night of September 18-19, 1031, and gives the Commission^ opinion on these events, accompanied by a statement of the reasons on which it is based (page 70).
                                     CO         &quot; (5) Being  convinced that both  Governments  are anxious  to  avoid     taking any action  which might disturb the peace and good understanding     between the two nations, notes that the  Chinese and Japanese representa-     tives have given assurances that their  respective Governments will take all     necessary steps to prevent any extension of the scope of the incident or any     aggravation of the situation;         &quot; (6) Requests  both  parties  to  do all in their  power to hasten  the     restoration of normal  relations between  them  and,  for that  purpose,  to     continue and speedily complete the execution of  the above-mentioned under-     takings;         &quot; (7) Requests both parties to furnish the  Council at frequent intervals     with full information as to the development of the situation;         &quot; (8) Decides,  in the absence of any unforeseen occurrence which might     render an  immediate  meeting  essential,  to  meet  again  at  Geneva on     Wednesday, the  14th October. 1931. to  consider  the  situation  as it  then     stands:         &quot; (9) Authorises its President to cancel the meeting of the Council fixed     for  the 14th October should  he decide, after consulting his  colleagues, and     more particularly the representatives of the two  parties, that, in view  of     such information as he may have received from the parties or from  other     members of the Council as to the development  of the situation,  the meeting     is no longer necessary.&quot;     The hopes of the Council were  not fulfilled.  On the 9th October the Chinesedelegation asked  for  an urgent meeting of the Council  on the  ground  that japanese troops had begun  further &quot; aggressive military  operations.&quot;   the reference was primarily to the aerial bombardment of Chinehow,(&apos;) where, afterthe capture of Mukden, the provincial Government had temporarily establisheditself.     The Council, at  its meeting in September,  had  decided to forward to theGovernment of the United States of America the minutes of its meeting and the documents  relating to  the  Sino-Japanese  dispute,  and  the  Government  ofthe United States had affirmed its whole-hearted  sympathy with the  attitudeof the League of Nations.     On  the 16th October it was  determined to continue  to co-operate with theGovernment of the United  States of America, which was invited to send  arepresentative  to  sit at the Council table.  The representative of the UnitedStates was authorised  by his Government &quot; to  consider with the  Council  the relationship between  the provisions  of the Pact of Paris  and  the presentunfortunate situation in Manchuria and, at the same  time, to follow the delibera-tions of  the Council with regard to other aspects of the  problem with which itis now confronted.&quot;     On  the 17th October a certain number of the Governments represented onthe Council (the United Kingdom, France, Germany,  the Irish Free State, Italy,Norway  and Spain) decided, as signatories of the  Pact of Paris, to address an identical note to the  Governments  of  China and Japan,  calling  their  attentionto the provisions of that pact and more especially to the terms of article 2, whereby&quot; the Contracting Parties agree that  the settlement  or solution  of  all disputesor conflicts of whatever nature or whatever origin they may be, which  may ariseamong them, shall never be  sought  except by pacific  means.&quot;     The United States Government sent a similar note to the two Governments.     On  the 22nd October the President of the Council  (the representative  ofFrance,  M. Briand),  submitted a draft  resolution  upon which  the  members  ofthe Council, other than the  parties, had unanimously agreed.     The draft resolution, after referring to the undertakings entered into bythe Governments of China and Japan in the resolution of the 30th September,and  to the Declaration  of the Japanese  representative that this country had no territorial  designs  in  Manchuria,  called  upon  the Japanese  Governmentimmediately to  begin the withdrawal of its  troops  into  the railway  zone and proceed therewith so that the whole of the troops might be withdrawn before thenext meeting of the Council.   It called  upon the Chinese Government to  make such arrangements for taking over  the territory thus evacuated as would ensure    (&apos;) The bombardment of Chinchow (October 8, 1931) is described on page 72 of the Report oftho Commission of Enquiry.
there the safety of the  lives and property of Japanese subjects, and  indicatedcertain measures of detail to be adopted for this purpose.     Recommendations were also made to  the two  Governments  that, as soon asthe evacuation was completed, they should open direct  negotiations on all thequestions outstanding between them, in  particular, in  respect of those arisingout of the recent incidents and of  those relating to the difficulties caused  by therailway situation  in Manchuria.   For this purpose, the Council suggested thatthe two parties should set up a conciliation committee or some  such permanent machinery.  Finally, it was proposed that the Council should meet again  on the16th November.     On the  23rd  October,  the  representative of China  accepted  the draft resolution as  a &quot; bare  minimum.&quot;   The representative of  Japan  submitted a counter-draft and  explained  that  his Government, in view of the tension  in manchuria and the state of disorder prevailing there, did not deem it possible to fix a definite date  by which the evacuation could be completed.  His government regarded it as absolutely indispensable that a calmer frame of mind  should  be restored, and, with this object in view, had determined a number of fundamentalpoints which should be the basis for normal relations between China and  Japan.He was not authorised to set out these fundamental points  in a resolution or todiscuss their details at the  Council table; they could better  be made the  subjectof direct negotiations between the parties.     The Council  considered that  it  was impossible to  refer to *&apos; fundamentalpoints &quot; in a draft resolution without knowing what they were.     The draft  resolution was not adopted, the Japanese representative  votingagainst it (the 24th October, 1931).  The Council, after taking the vote,  adjourned until the 16th November.     The Chinese representative, after the meeting of the 24th October, made thefollowing  declaration  to  the  president of  the  Council   on  behalf  of  hisGovernment:          &quot; China, like every member of the League of  Nations, is bound by the     Covenant to &apos; a scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations.&quot;   The Chinese     Government,  for its part, is  determined loyally to fulfil all its obligations     under the Covenant.  It is prepared to give proofs of this intention by under-     taking  to  settle all disputes with Japan as to  treaty interpretation  by     arbitration or judicial settlement, as provided in article 13  of the Covenant.         &quot; In pursuance of this purpose, the Chinese Government  is  willing to     conclude with Japan a treaty of arbitration similar to that recently concluded     between China and the United States of America, or to those  concluded of     recent years in increasing numbers between members of the  League.&quot;(*)     3. Development  of Japanese Military Operations in North Manchuria.     After the Council meeting in October, further Japanese military  operations took place  in  Manchuria  in  the neighbourhood  of the bridges carrying  the Taonan-Angangchi Railway over the River Nonni.  These bridges had  been destroyed in October  by the Chinese troops of the  President  of the Heilungkiang Provincial Government, General Ma Chan-shan, in order to stop the  advance of General Chang Hai-peng, who, according to the Chinese, had taken the offensive at the instigation of the Japanese.   To justify  Japanese  intervention  for the repair of these bridges, the Tokyo Government had represented to the  Chinese Government^) that the Taonan-Angangchi Railway had been built by the South Manchuria Company under a contract;  that the Chinese authorities had not  yet paid their debt; that they had refused to convert that debt into a loan, and that the railway might therefore be regarded as belonging to the South  Manchuria Company, which  had a great interest in preserving the property and in main- taining traffic on  the line.     On the 2nd November, the Japanese Government stated that, at  the  request of. the South Manchuria and the Taonan-Angangchi Railway Administration, a company of sappers had been sent on that day to repair the railway bridge under the protection of  troops (infantry, artillery and air forces).(T)     (3) Document C.071.VII; Official Journal, December 1931, page 2513.

j     104     The Japanese troops came into contact with the Chinese forces, which refusedto retire and were  driven  back.(s)   In November, the Japanese troops  reached and  even crossed  the  Chinese Eastern  Railway,  and  took  Angangchi.  andsubsequently Tsitsihar (the 19th November).4. Measures for the Re-organisation of the Civil Administration in Manchuria.     While  military  operations were thus  spreading  towards the  North  ofManchuria, progress was  made with  the  reorganisation of the civil adminis-tration.   At Mukden,  in  particular,  after  the  disorganisation caused by  the incident of  the 18th September, the administration of the municipality was firstentrusted to the Japanese  Colonel Doihara, and later, on the 20th October, to a.Chinese  mayor, Dr. Chao  Hsin-po,  doctor of law of the University  of Tokyo.Efforts were also made to organise a Liaoning provincial administration  in opposition to the former administration, which had  taken refuge at ChinchowThe &quot; Committee for the Maintenance of Peace and Order,&quot; constituted on the24th September, became in October the office of the autonomous Government ofthe Province of Liaoning.  The latter in turn was converted, on the 7th November,.into an acting Provincial Government of Liaoning, which announced that it wasbreaking off relations with the former North-Eastern Government and with theNationalist Government at Nanking.  At the same time, a Supreme AdvisoryCouncil was established, whose duties included those  of directing and supervisingthe Provincial  Government and encouraging the development of local  autonomy.All the new authorities, as also the banks of issue, had received Japanese advisers,who were, in many cases, influential officials  of the South Manchuria Railway. (9)     The representative of China insisted that the Japanese army was responsiblefor  setting up  and maintaining, at Mukden,  Kirin,  and other points in  itsoccupation, these new authorities, who were the &quot; puppets and creatures of theJapanese Army Command. &quot;(10)     The representative of  Japan replied that the &quot;  Japanese authorities had no alternative  but to encourage the formation by the Chinese  themselves of bodiesresponsible for the maintenance of order.....The efficient performance oftheir duties by those bodies would make much easier the rapid withdrawal oftroops, which was  desired by the Japanese Government, as had been formallystated on several occasions.&quot;^1)     Moreover,  several reports from Dr. Frederick A. Cleveland, Associate ChiefInspector of the Salt Revenue, were communicated  to the Council  in November1931 by  the Chinese delegation. These reports stated that the Japanese  militaryauthorities were forcibly seizing the salt revenues in the Manchurian  towns.  Itwas urged in  a Japanese communication  that  the &quot; action  of  the  militaryauthorities in intervening to  transfer the surplus revenues of the  Chinese SaltTax Office to another Chinese body (the local Committee for the Maintenance of order) could not be regarded as unjustifiable.&quot;(12)   5. Session of the Council in Novembe?-December 1931. Constitution of a                           Commission of Enquiry.     Meanwhile, the Council met in Paris on the 16th November, 1931, and, onthe 21st November, a Japanese proposal for  a Commission of Enquiry to be sentto the Far East was put forward, &apos;&apos; the creation and despatch of this commission.in no  way modifying the Japanese Governments sincere desire to withdraw itstroops as quickly  as possible within the  South Manchuria  Railway  zone inpursuance of the resolution of the 30th September.&quot;     This proposal  was considered,  and,  on the 10th December,  the  Counciladopted the following resolution :          &quot; The Council,         &quot; (1)  Reaffirms  the   resolution   passed  unanimously  by  it  on  the     30th September,  1931, by which the  two parties declare  that they  are     solemnly bound; it therefore calls upon the Chinese and Japanese  Govern-     ments  to  take all  steps  necessary  to assure   its  execution,  so that  the    (*) These operations are described in the Report of tho Commission of Enquiry (page72 etsoq.).

    withdrawal of the Japanese troops within the railway zone may be effected    as speedily as possible under the conditions set forth in the said resolution;         &quot; (2) Considering that events have assumed an even more serious aspect    since the Council meeting of the 24th October :         &quot; Notes that the two parties undertake to adopt all measures necessary    to avoid any further aggravation  of the situation and to refrain from any    initiative which may lead to further fighting and loss of life;         &quot; (3) Invites the two parties  to continue to keep the Council informed    as to the development of the situation;         &quot; (4) Invites the other  members  of the Council to furnish  the Council    with any information received from their representatives on the spot:         &quot; (5) Without prejudice to  the carrying  out of  the above-mentioned    measures,         &quot; Desiring, in view of the special circumstances of the case, to contribute    towards a final  and fundamental solution by the two Governments of the    questions at issue between them :         &quot; Decides to appoint a commission of five members to study on the spot    and  to  report  to  the  Council  on  any circumstance,   which, affecting    international relations, threatens to disturb peace between  China and Japan,    or the good understanding between them, upon which peace depends.         &quot;The Governments of China and of Japan will each have  the right to    nominate one assessor to assist the  commission.         &quot; The two Governments will afford the commission all facilities to obtain    on the spot whatever information it may require.         &quot; It is understood that, should the two parties initiate any negotiations,    these would not fall within  the  scope  of the terms of  reference of the    commission, nor would it be  within the competence  of  the commission to    interfere with the military arrangements of either party.         &quot; The  appointment  and  deliberations  of the commission  shall not    prejudice in any way the undertaking given by the Japanese Government in    the  resolution  of the 30th  September as regards the withdrawal of the    Japanese troops within the railway zone.         &quot; (6) Between now  and its next ordinary session, which  will be held    on the 25th January, 1932, the Council, which remains seized of the matter,    invites  its president to follow the question and to summon  it  afresh if    necessary.&quot;    The President (the French representative, M. Briand) emphasised, when he-submitted the resolution, the great importance which the Council attached  to itsresolution of the 30th September, 1931, and its conviction that the  two Govern-ments would carry out to the full the engagements which they had assumed under it.  He further stated that it was indispensable and urgent that the twro parties should abstain from any initiative which might lead to further fighting and fromany other action likely to aggravate the situation.    The Government of the United States, on the adoption of the resolution ofthe 10th December,  expressed its gratification that definite  progress had beenmade.6.  Japanese Operations against Chinchow. Disappearance of the Last Remains-                 of Chinese Authority in South Manchuria.    While the Council was drawing up the. text of this resolution, the two partiesrepeatedly called its attention to the danger of military operations spreading to south-West  Manchuria, and efforts were made to establish a neutral zone betweenthe Japanese troops  and those  of Marshal  Chang Hsueh-liang at Chinchow.These efforts were unsuccessful.   The  representative of Japan, referring  at thetime of its adoption to paragraph 2 of the resolution of the 10th December, statedthat he accepted it &quot; on the understanding that it was not intended to preclude the Japanese forces  from taking such action as might be rendered necessary toprovide directly for the protection of the lives and property of Japanese subjectsagainst the  activities of bandits and lawless elements rampant in various  partsof Manchuria.  Such action was admittedly an exceptional measure  called forby the special situation prevailing in Manchuria, and its necessity would naturally be obviated  when normal conditions should have been restored in that region.&quot;
    On the 23rd December a Japanese offensive was launched in the direction ofChinchow, which was occupied on the 3rd January, 1932.  The Japanese forcesthen advanced as far as the Great Wall and established contact with japanese troops stationed at Shanhaikwan to the south of the Wall.   As the result of these operations.  Chinese constituted  authority disappeared  entirely  from  SouthManchuria.           7. The Shanghai Hostilities. Origin of the Hostilities.    Outside Manchuria, from January 1932 onwards, the situation became worsealso at Shanghai.    In connexion with Shanghai, the League received four reports on events fromtheir beginning up to the 5th March from the Consular Commission(&quot;) which was set up on the spot early in February 1932.   Later events are described in  thereport of the  Commission of Enquiry, which  was constituted as already explained in January 1932 and arrived at Shanghai on the 14th March.    In this port, as in other parts of  China, the serious anti-Chinese riots whichhad occurred in Korea, as described in  the report of  the Commission  ofEnquiry,(,4) led, from July 1931 onwards, to a boycott of Japanese goods.   Theoccupation of Manchuria by Japanese troops intensified the  boycott with,  incertain  cases, the active support of official organisations and of the  ChineseGovernment.   Japanese  trade  suffered  heavy losses.   The tension between  the nationals of the two countries became acute and serious incidents occurred, as aresult of which the  Japanese residents in Shanghai  requested the  despatch oftroops and warships to put down the anti-Japanese  movement.  The JapaneseConsul-General then presented five demands  to the Chinese Mayor of  Greater-Shanghai.    The Mayor stated on the 21st January that he had difficulty in complying with two of  these demands (adequate control of  the  anti-Japanese movement;immediate  dissolution  of all anti-Japanese organisations  engaged in fosteringhostile feelings and anti-Japanese riots and agitation).    On the same day, the Admiral  in command  of the Japanese naval forcespublicly announced that, if  the reply of the Chinese mayor were unsatisfactory,he  was  determined  to take such measures as might  be necessary to protectJapanese rights and interests.  On the 24th January, Japanese naval reinforce-ments arrived off Shanghai.  Rumours  were current that the Chinese troops inthe Chinese quarter of Chapei were also being reinforced.   On the 27th January,the Japanese Consul-General asked  for a satisfactory reply to his  demands by o&apos;clock on the following morning.  The mayor,  who had informed the repre-sentatives of  the Powers of his intention to make all possible concessions to avoid a clash, succeeded in securing  the closing down of the Anti-Japanese  BoycottAssociation,  and  the Chinese police  sealed various offices on  the night of  the27th-28th January.  On the morning of the  28th January, the Japanese Admiralnotified the other foreign commanders of his intention to act  on  the following morning if the Chinese had not sent a satisfactory reply.  The Municipal Councilof the International Settlement met and.decided that a state of emergency shouldbe declared as  from 4 P.M.  on  the same day.  At  4 P.M. the Japanese  Consul-General informed the  consular  body that  a  Chinese  reply accepting all  theJapanese demands had been received, that this reply was entirely satisfactory andthat, for the  moment, no action would be taken.    Meanwhile, the Defence Committee of the International Settlement carrying-out the plans called for by a state of  emergency assigned to the different foreignforces the sectors they would have to defend.  The Japanese sector, as fixed bythe Defence Committee, included not  only a part of the Settlement, but a salientextending beyond it, bounded on the west by the Shanghai-Woosung Railway..The Japanese naval headquarters are  situated near the northern extremity of thissalient and in normal times there are posts  of Japanese marines on two roads North  Szechuen  Road  and Dixwell Road which belong  to the  Shanghai    (&quot;) Tho  commission consisted of the Consuls of  Italy  (Chairman), the United Kingdom,Fiance, Norway, Germany and Spain.   The Consul of the &quot;United States collaborated in the workof the commission.    (&quot;) Tho report of tho Commission of Enquiry describes on page 62 ct seq. the incidents which arose between Chinese and Korean farmers at Wanpaoshan (Manchuria) and how sensational  andinaccurate accounts of these incidents provoked a massacre of Chinese in Korea.[8245]c
Municipal Council.  At 11 P.M., the Japanese Admiral, referring to the state ofemergency,  announced that the  Imperial Navy, anxious  as to the situation inChapei, where numerous Japanese nationals resided, had  decided to send troops to this sector and hoped that the Chinese forces stationed at Chapei would bespeedily withdrawn to the west of the railway.     One hour later Japanese marines and armed civilians proceeded towards therailway; the last detachment attempted to reach the station by the Honan Roadgate leading out of the Settlement and the defence sectors.  It was stopped by the shanghai Volunteer  Corps, who were guarding this sector and who had receivedstrict orders based on the principle that the duty of defence forces was to defendand not to attack.     The Japanese troops sent to the Chapei sector in conformity with the plan ofdefence came into contact with the Chinese troops which, as the first report of the consular Commission notes, would not have had time to withdraw  even had they wished to do so.8. The  Shanghai,  Hostilitirg.-Discitssi.ons  of  the   Council. Reference to    Article 10 of the Covenant. First  Discussions of the  Assembly  under    Article 15. Termination of the Shanghai Hostilities.    This was the beginning of the battle of Shanghai, which the Council, then in session at Geneva, and the Powers having special interests in Shanghai repeatedlyendeavoured to stop.   It was  immediately after the serious incidents described above that China, on the 29th January, asked that the dispute should be dealt with under articles 10 and 15.    On the 16th February the members of the Council other  than China and japan addressed to the Japanese Government an urgent appeal calling attentionto article 10 of the Covenant from which it appeared to them to follow that &quot; noinfringement of the  territorial  integrity and no change  in  the political  inde-pendence of any member of the League brought about in disregard of that articleoUght to be recognised  as valid and effectual by members of the League. &quot;(15)    On the 19th February the Council, at the request of China,  referred thedispute to the Assembly.  The Assembly was convened to meet on the 3rd March.    The Council, before the Assembly met, made a last effort to stop the fightingby proposing on the 29th February that a round-table conference should be set upin Shanghai, subject to  the making  of local arrangements for a cessation ofhostilities.    The proposal of  the  Council was not  carried  into effect.   As  fightingcontinued, the Assembly, after hearing the representatives of the two parties onthe 3rd March, adopted the following resolution on the 4th March :          &quot; The Assembly,         &quot; Recalling the suggestions made by the Council on the 29th February    and without prejudice to the other measures therein envisaged          &quot; (1) Calls  upon  the  Governments of  China  and  Japan  to  take    immediately  the necessary measures to ensure that the orders which, as it    has been informed, have been issued by the military commanders on  both    sides for the cessation  of hostilities, shall be made effective;         &quot; (2) Requests the other Powers which have special interests in the    Shanghai Settlements to inform the Assembly of  the manner in which the    invitation set out  in the previous paragraph is executed;         &quot; (3) Recommends that negotiations be entered into by the Chinese and    Japanese  representatives, with  the assistance of the military, naval and    civilian authorities of the Powers mentioned above,  for the  conclusion of    arrangements which shall  render definite the cessation of hostilities and    regulate the withdrawal  of the Japanese  forces. The Assembly will be    glad to be kept informed by the Powers mentioned above of the development    of these negotiations.&quot;    On the 5th March the Government of the United States of America intimated that the American military authorities  at Shanghai  had been  instructed toco-operate.    (&quot;) Document 0.287.1932; Official Journal, March 1932, page 383.
                                     n     The proposed negotiations began at Shanghai on the 14th March.  On two occasions,  the Committee of Nineteen set up by the Assembly  intervened,  at China&apos;s request, to smooth away difficulties.  An armistice  was finally signed at Shanghai on the 5th  May and the withdrawal of the Japanese troops began on the  6th.  By the 31st May the divisions sent from Japan to  Shanghai had been re-embarked, one of those divisions the 14th being sent  to Manchuria. On the 1st July the Assembly was informed that Japanese naval landing troops, with very reduced effectives, were still temporarily stationed, in accordance with the agreement of the 5th May, at a small number of posts adjacent to the Settle- ment and  to  the extra-Settlement roads.   These detachments were  afterwards withdrawn.     The Chinese consider that the Japanese intervention at Shanghai cost them 24,000 soldiers and civilians killed, wounded or missing, and they estimate their material losses at about 1.500 million Mexican dollars. 9. Development  of  the  Japanese   Occupation   in   Manchuria. Progress  of      Administrative Reorganisation. The Constitution of &quot;Manchukuo.&quot;     While the Shanghai affair was progressing, the situation was also developing in Manchuria.     Harbin was occupied on the 5th February by  the  Japanese army which, during  the succeeding months, continued its operations against the remnants of the  former  Chinese  army,  the  &quot;volunteers,&quot;  the  &quot;brigands&quot;  and  other &quot;irregulars.&quot;  Guerilla  warfare continued over a veiy large part of Manchuria.     Progress  was also made with  the administrative reorganisation, the  first stages of which have already been mentioned above.     On the 17th February, 1932. a supreme  administrative council was constituted for the  whole  of Manchuria, and, on the 18th February, this Council published a declaration of independence.  On the 19th  February, the Japanese representative explained at a meeting of the Council in  Geneva that in Manchuria &apos;&apos; indepen- dence &quot;  was synonymous with &quot;autonomy&quot; and that &quot;Japan had  favourably regarded the establishment of this independence.&quot;  On the 9th March, the local administrations were amalgamated as an independent &quot; State&quot; under the name of &quot;Manchukuo.&quot;  M. Henry Pu-yi (the former Emperor Hsuan Tung) accepted the regency of this State.     The Chinese Government, which had already stated  on the 17th November, 1931, that  &quot;the ex-Emperor was kidnapped and escorted by the Japanese from the Japanese concession in Tientsin to Mukden for the purpose of establishing a bogus   Government  with  himself   proclaimed   as  Emperor,&quot;(16)  repeatedly denounced  the  establishment of  the so-called  State, &quot;which  from the  very beginning,  and at every subsequent stage  of its  development, had been created and maintained  at  the  instigation  and with the assistance of the Japanese military forces in Manchuria.&quot;(&apos;7) 10. Discussions of the Assembly. Resolution of March 11. Decisions regarding      the Time-limit for the Preparation of the Report  under Article 15.    Meanwhile  the  Assembly, continuing  its examination  of the  dispute  at Geneva, adopted, on the  llthMarch, 1932, after  a full discussion, the followingresolution :-                                      &quot;I.        &quot; The Assembly,        &apos;&apos; Considering that the provisions of the Covenant are entirely applicable    to the  present dispute, more particularly as regards:               &quot;(1) The principle of  a scrupulous  respect for treaties;             &quot; (2) The undertaking  entered into by members of the  League of        Nations to respect and preserve as against external aggression the terri-        torial integrity  and existing political independence of all the members        of the League;    (10) Document C.868.1931; Official Journal, December 1931, page 2550.

         &apos;&apos; (3) Their obligation to submit  any dispute  which  may  arise    between them to procedures for peaceful settlement;    &quot;Adopting the principles laid down by the acting President of theCouncil, M. Briand, in his declaration of the 10th December, 1931;      Recalling the fact that twelve members of the Council again invokedthose principles in their  appeal to the  Japanese  Government  on the16th  February,  1932,  when they declared &apos; that no  infringement of theterritorial  integrity and  no change  in the  political independence  of anymember  of  the  League brought  about in disregard of  article  10 of theCovenant ought to  be  recognised as valid and effectual by members of theLeague  of Nations&apos;;    &apos;&apos; Considering that the principles governing international relations andthe peaceful settlement of disputes between members  of  the  League above referred to are in full  harmony with  the Pact of Paris, which is one of the corner-stones of the peace organisation of the  world and  under article 2of which &apos; the high  contracting parties agree that  the settlement or solutionof all disputes or conflicts, of whatever nature and  whatever origin they maybe, which may arise among them shall never be  sought except by pacificmeans&apos;;    &apos;&apos; Pending the steps which it may ultimately take for the settlement ofthe dispute which has been referred to it;    &apos;&apos; Proclaims the binding nature of the principles and provisions referredto above and declares that it is incumbent upon the members of the  Leagueof Nations not to recognise any situation, treaty  or agreement  which may bebrought about by means contrary to the Covenant  of the League of nations or to  the Pact of Paris.                                 &quot;II.    &quot;The Assembly,    &quot;Affirming that it is contrary to the spirit  of the Covenant that thesettlement of the Sino-Japanese dispute should be sought under the stress ofmilitary pressure on the part of either party :    &quot; Recalls the resolutions adopted  by the Council on the  30th September,and on the 10th  December,  1931, in agreement with the parties;    &quot; Recalls also its  own resolution of  the 4th  March, 1932,  adopted inagreement  wdth  the parties, with a view  to  the definitive cessation ofhostilities and the withdrawal of the Japanese forces; notes  that the Powersmembers of  the League of  Nations having special  interests in the ShanghaiSettlements  are  prepared to give every assistance  to this end, and requeststhose  Powers,  if necessary,  to  co-operate  in  maintaining  order  in theevacuated zone.                                 &quot;III.    &quot;The Assembly,    &apos;&apos; In view of the request formulated on the 29th January by the ChineseGovernment, invoking  the application  to the  dispute  of the  procedureprovided for in article 15 of the Covenant of the League  of Nations;    &apos;&apos; In view of the request formulated on the 12th February by the ChineseGovernment  that the  dispute should be  referred  to  the  Assembly  inconformity with article 15, paragraph 9, of the Covenant and in view of the council&apos;s decision of the 19th February;    &quot; Considering that the whole o&apos;f the dispute which forms  the subject ofthe Chinese Governments  request is  referred to it and that it is under an obligation to apply the procedure of conciliation provided for in paragraph 3of article 15 of  the  Covenant and, if necessary, the procedure in regard to recommendations provided for in paragraph 4 of the same article :    &quot; Decides to set up  a committee of nineteen  members namely, thePresident of the Assembly, who will  act as chairman of the committee, themembers of the  Council other than the parties to  the dispute  and six  othermembers to be elected by secret ballot.    &apos;&apos; This committee, exercising its  functions on behalf of and under the supervision of the Assembly, shall be instructed :          &quot; (1) To report as soon as possible on the cessation of hostilities and    the conclusion  of  arrangements which  shall render definitive the said
         cessation and shall regulate the withdrawal of the Japanese forces in         conformity with the Assembly resolution of the 4th March, 1932;             &quot;(2) To follow  the execution of the resolutions adopted by  the         Council on the 30th September and the 10th December. 1931;             &quot; (3) To endeavour to prepare  the  settlement of  the dispute  in         agreement with the parties, in accordance with article 15, paragraph 3,         to the Covenant, and to submit a  statement to the Assembly;             &quot; (4) To propose,  if necessary,  that  the  Assembly  submit  to  the         Permanent Court of International Justice  a  request for an advisory         opinion;             &quot; (5) To prepare, if need be, the  draft of the report  provided for in         article 15, paragraph 4. of the  Covenant;             &quot; (6) To propose any urgent measure which may appear necessary:             &quot; (7) To submit  a  first progress  report to the Assembly as soon as         possible and at latest on the 1st May, 1932.         &quot; The Assembly requests the  Council to communicate  to the committee,    together  wdth any observations it may have to make, any documentation that    it may think fit to transmit  to the  Assembly.         &quot;The Assembly shall remain  in session and its President may convene    it as soon as he may deem  this necessary.&quot;    On the 12th March, the Government of the United States of  America declaredthat the  action of the Assembly would go far towards  developing into terms ofinternational law7  the principles of order and justice which underlay  the ParisPact and the League Covenant.   The  United States Government  was  especiallygratified  that the nations of the world were united on  a policy not to recognise the validity of results attained in violation of the treaties in question, and thiswas a distinct contribution to international law and offered a constructive basis for peace.    On   the  1st  July,  1932,  having  been informed  that the  report  of  theCommission of Enquiry could not be completed before September, the Assembly,after obtaining the consent of the two parties, decided  to prolong, to the extent that might be strictly necessarj&apos;, the time-limit of  six months  laid down in  theCovenant for the preparation  of its report.    In the letter  addressed on  the  24th June to  the representatives  of Chinaand Japan, proposing an extension  of  the time-limit laid down in the Covenant,the president of the Assembly said  :          &quot; . . . .  It is my duty to add that  I have every confidence that  the    undertaking not  to aggravate the  situation entered into by the two parties    before the Council and recorded  by the  latter on  the 30th  September and    the 10th December (1931), in resolutions which retain their  full  executory    force will be scrupulously observed.  I am sure that you will agree with    me that  these resolutions  will continue to be  fully valid during the period    for which the time-limit of six  months may be extended.  I would  also refer    you  to the resolution which the Assembly adopted  on the  11th March, and    in which it recalled the two resolutions  of the  Council.&quot;(&quot;)    After the adoption of the extension of the time-limit, the president referredto this passage of his letter and  added :-         &quot; Such being the case, the decision just taken by the Assembly authorises    me  to declare that the parties must abstain from any action  that might    compromise the success of the work of the Commission of  Enquiry or  of    any  efforts the League may make with a view to a settlement.         &quot; I  would  remind you also  that, on the  11th  March,  the  Assembly    proclaimed &apos; that it is incumbent upon the members  of the League of Nations    not  to recognise  any situation, treaty or  agreement which may be brought    about by means contrary  to the Covenant of  the League  of  Nations or  to    the Pact of Paris.&apos;&quot;(&quot;)   , (&quot;) Official Journal, Special Supplement No. 102,  page  35.   ..(&quot;) Official Journal, Special Supplement.No. 102, page. 10.  ,
    11.  The Organisation of &quot;Manchukuo.&quot; Recognition of &quot;Manchukuo&quot;                                 by Japan.    Meanwhile  the process of  organising the  Government of &quot;Manchukuo&apos;&apos;continued.  The Government created a central bank and undertook the adminis-tratiun  of  the salt revenue  (declaring  its willingness  to  continue  to pay an equitable proportion of the sums required for the service of the foreign loanssecured on the receipts of the salt revenue), of the Customs (making a similardeclaration as regards the loans and indemnities secured on the Customs revenue),of the postal services, &amp;c.    A &quot; Manchukuo &quot; army was created with the assistance of Japanese officersengaged as advisers. In a communication, dated the 8th April, 1932, the JapaneseGovernment announced that &quot; the Japanese forces are at present providing theforces of the new Government in a friendly spirit with such assistance as theymay need to restore and maintain order and tranquillity.&quot;^0)    According to the observations of the Japanese Government, dated the 18thNovember, 1932, the presence of the Japanese troops in the country would &quot; enablethe principal bandit units to be wiped out within from two to three years.V(21)    The relations  between Japan and  the new  State  were defined after thedespatch to Changchun, capital  of  &quot;Manchukuo,&quot; of  General  Muto, who, onthe 8th August, had been appointed Commander-in-chief  of the Kwantung Army,and, at the same time, Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary on specialmission and  Governor-General of Kwantung, in  order  to  control the consularservice, the Government of the Leased Territory and  all the Japanese forces in manchuria.   The  new Ambassador carried no credentials and the appointment was made unilaterally by Japan.(&quot;)    On the  15th September,  General Muto signed with  the Prime Minister of&quot;Manchukuo&quot;  a protocol containing the following provisions:         &quot; Whereas Japan has recognised the fact that Manchukuo, in accordance    with  the  free wall  of   its  inhabitants, has  organised   and  established    itself as an independent State; and        &apos;&apos; Whereas Manchukuo has declared its intention of abiding by all inter-    national engagements entered into by China in so far as they are applicable    to Manchukuo;        &apos;&apos; Now the Governments of Japan and Manchukuo have, for the purpose    of  establishing a perpetual  relationship of good  neighbourhood  between    Japan and Manchukuo, each respecting the territorial rights of the  other,    and also in order to secure the peace of the Far East, agreed as follows :               &quot; (1)  Manchukuo shall confirm and respect, in so far as no agree-        nient to the contrary shall be made between Japan and Manchukuo in        the future, all rights and interests possessed by Japan or her subjects        within the territory of  Manchukuo by virtue  of Sino-Japanese treaties,        agreements or other arrangements or of Sino-Japanese contracts, private        as well as public;             &quot; (2)  Japan and Manchukuo, recognising  that  any threat to the       &apos; territory or to  the  peace and  order of the high contracting parties        constitutes, at the same time, a threat to the safety and existence of the        other, agree to co-operate in the maintenance of their national security,        it being understood  that such Japanese forces as may be necessary for        this purpose shall be stationed in Manchukuo.        &quot; The  present protocol  shall  come  into  effect from  the  date of its    signature.....&quot;    &quot;Manchukuo&quot; was thus  formally recognised  by  Japan.   The  ChineseGovernment protested  against this recognition.  It represented that,  &quot; following the precedent of her policy in Korea, Japan has established a virtual protectorateover Manchuria as a step towards annexation.&quot;(&quot;)    (-&quot;) Document 0.357.198*2; Official  Journal,  Special Supplement No. 101, page 268. :    (-&apos;) Document C.775.1932.VII,  page 32.

      12.  Consideration by the Council of the Report  of  the Commission                                 of Enquiry.     The  report of the Commission of Enquiry  was signed at Peiping on  the 4th September, 1932, and was communicated to the two Governments and to the members of the League on the 1st  October. The Japanese Government asked for a minimum period of six weeks in which to communicate its observations upon it to the Council, and  the  Council  decided on the 24th September to begin its consideration of the report at latest on the 21st November.     On this occasion, the president of  the  Council (the  representative of  the Irish Free State,  Mr. de Valera) expressed  regret with which  the  Special Committee of the Assembly at its public meeting on the 1st October associated itself that,  before even the  publication of the commission^ report, Japan,  not only by recognising but also by signing a treaty with what was known as  the &quot; Manchukuo &quot; Government, had taken steps wdiich could not but be regarded as calculated to prejudice the settlement of the dispute.  &quot; For almost a year,&quot; Mr.  de Valera  said, &quot; the Council in  its collective capacity and the individual Governments which composed it  had scrupulously refrained from uttering any word of  judgment on the merits  of this grave dispute on the grounds that a commission had been set up to investigate the dispute in all its bearings and that, until  that commission had reported, and  its report  had been considered by  the organs of the League, the whole question was still to be regarded as sub judice.&quot;    The  Council, at meetings held from  the 21st to 28th  November, 1932, con- sidered the report of the commission and the observations of the parties.  In reply to a  question by the president, Lord Lytton stated, on behalf of the Commissionof Enquiry, that the latter did not wish to add anything to  its report.    As regards the recommendations contained in the report, the  Council noted that it was not  able to find in the  declaration  of the Chinese and Jayianese repre- sentatives any measure of agreement between the parties which would enable itusefully to engage in a discussion and to submit observations or suggestions tothe Assembly.    In these circumstances, the Council merely transmitted to the Assembly  thereport of  the Commission of Enquiry, the observations of the parties and  theMinutes of its meetings. 13. Discussion of the Report of the Commission of Enquiry by the Assembly.                       Attempt to negotiate a Settlement.     The Assembly met on the 6th December, 1932.  After a general discussion it adopted, on the 9th December, the following resolution :          &quot; The Assembly,         &apos;&apos; Having received the report of the Commission of Enquiry set up under     the resolution adopted on the  10th December, 1931, by the Council, together     with the observations of the parties and the Minutes of the Council meetings     held from the 21st to the 28th November, 1932;         &quot; In view of the discussions which took place at its meetings  from     the 6th to 9th December, 1932 :         &quot; Requests the  Special  Committee  appointed under  its resolution of     the 11th March, 1932 :-             &quot; (1) To study the report of the Commission of Enquiry, the observa-         tions of the  parties  and the opinions and suggestions expressed in the         Assembly, in whatever form they were submitted;             &quot; (2) To draw up  proposals with  a view to the settlement of the         dispute  brought  before  it under the  Council resolution  dated the         19th  February, 1932;           .  &quot; (3) To submit these proposals  to the  Assembly  at the  earliest.         possible moment.&quot;    The Special Committee of Nineteen drew up two draft resolutions and astatement of reasons indicating generally the basis on which it thought it possibleto.continueits endeavours to effect a settlement of the dispute.
These texts were as follows : Draft Resolution No. 1.    &quot; The Assembly,    &quot; Recognising that, according to the terms of article 15 of the Covenant,its  first duty is to endeavour to effect a settlement  of the dispute,  andthat consequently it is not at present called upon to draw  up a report stating the facts of the dispute and its recommendations in regard thereto;    &quot; Considering that, by its resolution of the 11th March. 1932, it  laiddown the  principles determining the attitude of the League of Nations inregard to  the settlement of the dispute :    &quot; Affirms that in such a settlement the provisions of the Covenant of theLeague of Nations, the Pact of Paris and the Nine-Power Treaty must be respected;    &quot; Decides to set up a committee  whose duty  will be  to  conduct, inconjunction with the parties,  the negotiations with  a  view to a settlement.on  the basis  of the principles  set out in Chapter IX of the report of theCommission  of Enquiry, and  having regard to the  suggestions made in chapter X of that report;    &quot; Appoints, to form a committee, the members of the  League represented on the Special Committee of Nineteen;    &quot; Considering it desirable that the United States of America and theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics should consent  to take part  in thenegotiations, entrusts to the above-mentioned committee the duty of inviting the Governments of the  United States of America and the Union of soviet socialist Republics to take part in these negotiations;    &quot; Authorises it to take such measures as it may deem  necessary for thesuccessful execution of its mission;    &quot; Requests the committee to report on its  work before  the 1st March.1933.     &quot; The committee  will have power to fix.  in agreement with the two parties, the time-limit referred to in the Assembly resolution  of the 1st July.1932; should the two parties  fail to agree on the duration of such a time-limit, the committee will, simultaneously with the presentation of its report.submit proposals to the Assembly on the subject.     &quot; The Assembly shall remain in session, and its President may conveneit as soon as he may deem this necessary.&quot;Draft Resolution No. 2.     &quot; The Assembly thanks the Commission of  Enquiry  appointed in virtueof  the  Council&apos;s resolution of  the  10th December, 1931,  for the valuable assistance it has afforded to  the League of Nations,  and declares  that itsreport will stand as an example of conscientious and impartial work.&quot;Statement of Reasons.     &quot;. The Assembly, in its resolution of the 9th December,  1932, requestedits Special Committee :          &quot; (1) To study the  report of  the  Commission  of Enquiry, the     observations of the parties,  and the opinions and suggestions expressed     in the Assembly, in whatever form^they were submitted;          &quot; (2) To draw up proposals with a view to the  settlement of the     dispute   brought  before  it under  the Council  resolution  dated the     19th February, 1932;          &quot; (3) To submit these  proposals to the Assembly at the earliest     possible moment.&quot;     &apos;&apos; If the committee had  had to lay before the Assembly  a  picture of events and an appreciation of the general situation, it would have found all the elements necessary for such a statement in the first eight chapters of the report of the Commission  of  Enquiry, which, in  its opinion,  constitute  a balanced, impartial and complete statement of the principal facts.     &apos;&apos; But the time has not come for such a statement.  In accordance with article 15,  paragraph  3, of the Covenant,  the Assembly must first of all
     endeavour to effect a settlement of the dispute by conciliation, and,  if such     efforts are successful, it shall publish a statement giving such facts as it may     deem appropriate.  If it fails, it is its duty, in virtue of paragraph 4 of the     same article, to  make a  statement of the facts of the dispute and recom-     mendations in regard thereto.         &quot;So long as the efforts on the  basis  of article 15.  paragraph 3. are     continued, a sense of the  responsibilities  placed on the Assembly in the     various contingencies provided  for in the Covenant obliges it to maintain a     particular reserve.  Hence, the  Committee has confined itself, in  the draft     resolution which it is to-day submitting to the Assembly, to making proposals     with a view to conciliation.         &quot; By the Assembly&apos;s resolution of the 11th March, the Special Committee     was instructed to endeavour to prepare the settlement of the dispute in     agreement with the parties.  Since,  on  the other hand, it is desirable that     the  United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics     should join in the efforts made in collaboration with the representatives of     the parties, it is proposed that the Governments of these two countries should     be invited to take part in the negotiations.         &apos;&apos; In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to make it plain that what     is contemplated at the present stage with the co-operation of  two countries     not  members of the League is solely the  negotiation  of a settlement  by     conciliation,  the  Special Committee suggests  that it  should be regarded for     this purpose as a new Committee responsible for conducting negotiations, and     should be authorised in this capacity to invite  the Governments  of the United     States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to take part     in its meetings.         &quot; The Negotiations Committee will have all the powers necessary for the     execution of its mission.  In particular, it may consult experts. 1 It may, if     it thinks fit,  delegate part of its powers to one or more sub-committees, or to     one or more particularly qualified persons.         &apos;&apos; The members of the Negotiations Committee wall be guided as regards     matters of law by Parts  I  and  II of the Assembly  Resolution of the 11th     March, 1932, and, as regards matters of fact, by the findings set out in the     first eight chapters of the report of the Commission of Enquiry.  As regards     the  solutions to be considered, they will  seek them on the  basis  of the     principles set out in Chapter IX of the report of the Commission of Enquiry     and  having regard to the suggestions made in  Chapter X of the said report.         &quot; In this connexion, the  Committee of Nineteen considers that, in the     special circumstances which characterise the  dispute, a mere  return to the     conditions previous to September 1931 would  not suffice to ensure a durable     settlement, and that the maintenance and recognition of the present regime     in Manchuria could not be regarded as a solution.&quot;     On the 15th December the two draft resolutions and the statement of reasonswere submitted to the  parties.  The Chinese and Japanese delegations proposed amendments,  and the President of the Committee and the Secretary-General were authorised to  enter into conversations with  them.  On the  20th December, thecommittee decided to adjourn until the 16th January. 1933, at latest, in order toenable the conversations to continue.   14.  Japanese Military Operations at Shanhaikwan within the Great Wall.     Early  in  January 1933  occurred  the serious  incidents at Shanhaikwan.Situated at the extremity  of the Great  Wall,  half-way between  Peiping andMukden, this  city has always been  regarded as of great strategic importance.It is on  the route followed by invaders  who, coming  from Manchuria, wish  to penetrate into what is now the Province of Hopei.   Moreover, from Hopei is theeasiest route  into Jehol, a province  which Japan regards as forming part  of&quot;Manchukuo.&quot;   It was from the north of Hopei that,  according  to Japanesecommunications, Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang was  sending  considerable forcesinto Jehol, and that,  according to Chinese communications,  the Japanese armyintended to begin large-scale operations in Jehol.     A Japanese  communication of  the 29th  December,  1932,(21) reported  thatduring the last few days the mobilisation of Chinese troops directed against Jehol    (-*) Document A.(Extr.j. 1.1988.

was  especially  marked.  The Japanese  delegation  further  stated  on the 4thJanuary,  1933,(-&quot;&apos;)  that  the Japanese   authorities at  Feiping   had  vainlyendeavoured to persuade General  Chang to stop this movement of forces, andthat in these circumstances of &quot; tension and anxiety &quot; an incident had occurred at Shanhaikwan on the night of the lst-2nd January.     Units of the Japanese  army of Kwantung passed  the Great Wall and thetown was attacked.   It was occupied on the 3rd January.     The Chinese Government asserts that, during  this operation, thousands of peaceful citizens were slaughtered.  It addressed a protest on the 11th january to the Powers signatories of the protocol  of 1901 against the unlawful advantagetaken by Japan of a special privilege claimed under the protocol.   It declaredthat it could not assume  any responsibility for a  situation  resulting from theexercise  by  Chinese  defensive  forces of their  legitmate  right to resist theaggressive acts of the Japanese troops.(&quot;&apos;&apos;)          15.  Failure of the Procedure for Negotiating a. Settlement.     The Committee of Nineteen met again on  the 16th January, 1933.  It  notedthat, though the conversations with the representatives of the parties concerningthe draft resolutions  and  the statement of reasons  framed by it had continued,no new- proposal had been  received apart from the amendments submitted inDecember by the Chinese  and Japanese  delegations.  The Japanese delegation,however, had stated that it was in communication with its Government regardingnew proposals which would be submitted within forty-eight hours.     The committee received these proposals on the 18th January.  It noted thatthey differed in several fundamental points from those wdiich it had communicatedto the parties on the 15th December.  As, however, the Japanese delegation,  whensubmitting the  new proposals of its Government, had specially emphasised thatthe  latter attached great importance to the  stipulation that  the  body  to beappointed for the settlement of the dispute should  include only members of theLeague,  the Committee of  Nineteen  felt that,  if this  were the only objectionraised  by Japan to the texts which  had been communicated,  it should not beimpossible to settle the question in consultation with the parties.   It therefore asked for supplementary information, particularly  on the point whether, if this difficulty were overcome, Japan would  be prepared to accept the draft  resolution no. 1 of the 15th December.   The committee thought it should await the Japanesereply on this point before continuing its conversations with the Chinese delega-tion, whose proposals did not differ so fundamentally as those of Japan from the texts communicated to the two parties.     On the  21st January the committee noted that the effect of the statements made by the Japanese delegate to its chairman and  to the Secretary-General wasthat the Japanese Government was not prepared to accept draft resolution No. 1,even if the  provision that non-member States be invited to participate in thenegotiations for a settlement were eliminated  from the  draft.     The Japanese  delegation,  in  making these statements, bad  submitted new proposals on behalf of its Government.     The committee, after examining these proposals (Annex 1), together with the amendments submitted by the Chinese delegation to the committee&apos;s texts of the15th December (Annex  2), could do no more than note that it was impossible  to frame a draft resolution acceptable to the two  parties.   The importance attachedby the Chinese  delegation  and by the committee itself to the participation of theUnited States of America and of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the negotiation of a settlement made it impossible to eliminate at the sole request of japan the provision concerning the invitation to those States, if the committee must at  the same time modify in  the sense of the Japanese  proposals the  other provisions of draft resolution No. 1.     The committee further  noted  that, even if it agreed to transform the  state-ment of reasons into a declaration  made by the chairman on behalf of thecommittee, to which the parties would be free to submit reservations, the JapaneseGovernment  did not accept the  text  established by  the  committee  on the15th December, but asked, in its new  proposals, that important  amendments  tothe text should be made which the committee could  not  accept.

     In view of  this situation, the  Committee  of Nineteen noted  that, after endeavouring to  prepare,  in  accordance  with the mission entrusted to it,  the settlement of the dispute in agreement with the parties,  it appeared to it to be impossible to submit proposals to  that effect to the Assembly.     The committee, therefore, in execution of the task entrusted to it under Part III (paragraph 5) of the resolution  of the 11th March, 1932, has prepared the  present draft report as  contemplated  in article 15, paragraph 4, of  the Covenant.     In deciding to begin the preparation  of this draft report, the committee  did not fail to point  out that the Assembly was alone competent to apply,  after the failure of the negotiations,  the  provisions  of article 15, paragraph  4.  The committee  therefore remained at the disposal  of the  parties  for any further proposals they might desire to communicate to it.     On the 8th February the Japanese representative submitted  to the committee further amendments to the text prepared on the 15th December (Annex 3).  On the 9th February the committee, after considering these amendments, deemed it desirable to ask for further information in regard thereto, in particular, whether the Japanese Government accepted as one of  the bases  for the  contemplated conciliation principle 7  in Chapter IX  of the  report of the  Commission  of Enquiry regarding the  establishment in Manchuria  of a  large  measure  of autonomy consistent with the  sovereignty  and  administrative integrity of China. This question was submitted  to the  Japanese delegation in a letter of the same date (Annex 4).    The Japanese Government  replied  on  the  14th  February  that it  was convinced  that   the  maintenance and   recognition of  the  independence  of &quot; Manchukuo &quot; were the only guarantee of peace in  the Far East, and that  the.whole question would eventually be solved  between Japan and China on that basis (Annex 5).  Iu reply  to  this  communication,  the committee, to its deep regret, felt bound  to hold that the Japanese proposals put forward on the 8th  February did not afford an acceptable basis for conciliation. It added that it was, of course,willing to examine up to the date of the final meeting of the Assembly any further proposals which the Japanese Government might wish to make, but that it was sure that the Japanese delegation would realise that any aggravation of  theexisting  situation must render more difficult, if not indeed frustrate, further efforts at conciliation (Annex  6).    On the same date the committee adopted the draft of the present report.             PART III. CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS  OF THE DISPUTE.    It will be seen  from this review that for more than sixteen months  theCouncil or Assembly has continuously tried to find a solution  for  the  Sino-Japanese  dispute. Numerous resolutions have  been adopted based on variousarticles of the Covenant and other international  agreements.   The complexity,to which reference has already been made,  of the historical background of  the events;  the special legal situation of Manchuria, where Japan,  as will be  notedlater, exercised within  Chinese territory extensive rights;  finally, the involved and  delicate  relations  existing in fact between  the  Chinese  and  Japaneseauthorities in certain parts of Manchuria justified  and rendered necessary  the prolonged efforts of negotiation and enquiry made by the League.  However,  thehopes entertained by the Council and the Assembly of an improvement, in  thesituation,  arising from the declarations of the parties and the resolutions adoptedwith  their participation, were disappointed.  The  situation,  on the contrary,tended to  grow constantly worse.  In Manchuria, or other  parts of the territory of a  member of the  League,  military operations, which  the report of  theCommission of Enquiry has described as &quot; war in disguise,&quot; continued and stillcontinue.    Having considered the principal  features of the dispute, the Assembly  has reached, in particular, the following conclusions and  noted the following facts :     1. The dispute between China and  Japan which  is submitted to the Assemblyoriginated in Manchuria, which China and foreign Powers have  always regardedas an integral part of China under Chinese sovereignty.  In its observations on       [8245]                     .                                D 2
 the report of the Commission of Enquiry,(&apos;-7) the Japanese Government contests the argument that the rights conferred on  Russia and subsequently acquired by Japan &quot; in the extremely limited area known as the Southern Manchuria Railway zone &quot; conflict with Chinese sovereignty.  &quot; They were, on the contrary, derived from the sovereignty of China.&quot;      The rights conferred  by China on  Russia and subsequently on Japan  derive from the sovereignty of  China.  Under the Treaty  of Peking in 1905, &quot; the Imperial  Chinese Government consented to  all the transfers and assignments made by Russia  to Japan  &quot; under  the Treaty of Portsmouth.  In 1915 it was to China that  Japan  addressed demands for  the extension of  her  rights  in Manchuria, and  it was with  the  Government  of the Chinese Republic that, following on these demands,  the Treaty of the  25th  May, 1915, was concluded concerning South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia.  At the Washington Conference the Japanese delegation stated, on  the 2nd February, 1922, that  Japan renounced  certain preferential rights  in South  Manchuria and  Eastern  Inner Mongolia and explained that,  &quot; in coming to this  decision, Japan had been guided by a spirit of fairness and moderation, having always in view China&apos;s sovereign rights  and the principle  of  equal  opportunity.&quot;(2S)   The Nine-PoAver Treaty, concluded at the Washington  Conference, applies to Manchuria as to every other part of China.  Finally, during the first phase of the present conflict Japan never argued that Manchuria was not an integral part of China.     2.  Past experience shows  that those who control Manchuria exercise  a con- siderable influence on the affairs of the  rest  of China at least of North China  and possess unquestionable strategic and political  advantages.  To cut off these provinces from the rest of China cannot but create a serious irredentist problem likely to endanger peace.     3.  The Assembly, in noting these facts, is not uumindful of the tradition of autonomy existing in Manchuria.  That tradition,  in one extreme case, and in a period  of particular weakness  on the part of  the Central Government of China. made it possible,  for instance,  for the plenipotentiaries of Marshal Chang Tso-lin to conclude, in the name of the &quot; Government of the  autonomous three Eastern Provinces of the Republic of China,&quot; the agreement of the 20th September, 1924, with the Union  of Soviet Socialist  Republics concerning  the Chinese Eastern Railway, navigation, the delimitation of frontiers, &amp;c.  It is obvious from the provisions of  that agreement, however,  that the  Government of the autonomous three Eastern Provinces did  not regard itself as the  Government of a  State independent of China, but believed  that it might itself negotiate with  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on questions affecting the interests of China in the three provinces, though  the Central Government had, a few months previously, concluded an agreement  on these questions with the self-same Power.     This autonomy of Manchuria was also shown by the fact that, first, Marshal Chang Tso-lin, and later Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang, were the heads both of thecivil and military administration and exercised the effective power in the  three provinces through their armies and their officials.  The independence proclaimed by Marshal Chang Tso-lin at different  times  never meant that either he or the people of Manchuria  wished to be  separated  from China.  His armies did not invade  China as if it were a foreign country, but merely as participants in the civil war.   Through all its wars and  periods&apos;of &quot;independence&quot; Manchuria remained an  integral part of China.  Further,  since  1928 Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang has recognised the authoi^ty of  the Chinese National  Government.    4. During the quarter of a century ending in  September 1931 the politicaland economic ties uniting Manchuria with the rest of China grewr stronger, while,at the same time, the  interests  of Japan in Manchuria  did not cease to develop.Under  the  Chinese Republic,  the  &quot; three Eastern  Provinces &quot;  constitutingManchuria  were  thrown wide to the immigration of  Chinese from  the  other provinces who, by  taking possession of the land, have made  Manchuria in many respects a simple  extension of  China north of  the Great Wall.  In a populationof about 30 millions,  it  is estimated that the Chinese or assimilated  Manchusnumber 28  millions. Moreover, under  the  administration of Marshals  ChangTso-lin  and Chang Hsueh-liang, the Chinese  population and Chinese interests have played a  much more important part than formerly in the development and organisation of the economic resources of Manchuria.   (&quot;) Document 0.775.1932, page  18.   [-&quot;) Conference on tho Limitation of Armaments,  Washington, 1922,  page 1512.
     On the other hand, Japan had acquired or claimed in Manchuria rights the effect of which was to restrict the exercise of sovereignty by China in a manner and to a  degree quite  exceptional.  Japan  governed  the  leased territory  of Kwantung, exercising therein what amounted in practice to full sovereignty. Through  the medium of  the  South Manchuria Railway, she  administered the railway  zones, including several towns  and important parts of populous cities, such as Mukden and Changchun.  In these areas  she had  control of the police, taxes,  education and public utilities.  She maintained armed forces in certain parts of the country; the army of Kwantung in  the leased territory;  railway guards in the railway zones;  consular  police in the various districts.  Such a state of affairs might, perhaps, have continued without leading to complications and incessant disputes if  it had been freely desired  or accepted by both parties and if it had been the expression and manifestation of a well-understood policy of  close  economic  and  political co-operation.   But, in  the absence of  such conditions, it was bound to lead to mutual misunderstandings and conflicts.  The interconnexion  of  respective  rights, the  uncertainty  at  times  of  the legal situation, the increasing opposition  between the conception held by the Japanese of their &quot; special position  &quot;  in Manchuria and the  claims of Chinese nationalism were a further source of numerous incidents and disputes.     5. Before the 18th September, 1931, each  of the  two parties had legitimate grievances against the other in  Manchuria. Japan taking  advantage of rights open to question and the Chinese authorities putting obstacles in the way of the exercise of rights which could not be contested.  During the period immediately preceding  the events of the  18th September, various efforts were made to settle the  questions outstanding between  the  twro parties  by  the normal  method  of diplomatic  negotiations and  pacific means,  and  these means  had  not  been exhausted.   Nevertheless,  the  tension between   Chinese  and  Japanese  in Manchuria increased and  a movement of opinion in Japan advocated the settle- ment of all outstanding questions if necessary, by force.     6. The present period of  transition and national reconstruction in  China, despite the efforts  of the Central  Government and  the considerable  progress already achieved, necessarily involves political disturbances, social disorder and disruptive tendencies inseparable from  a state of transition.   It calls for the employment of a policy of international co-operation.   One of the methods of that policy  would be that the League of  Nations would continue to afford China the technical assistance in modernising her institutions which her Government might request with a view to enabling the  Chinese people to reorganise and consolidate the  Chinese  State.     The full application of  the policy of international co-operation initiated at the  Washington Conference, the principles of which are  still valid, has  been delayed,  chiefly by  the violence  of  the  anti-foreign propaganda  carried on  in China  from time to time.  In two respects-the use of the economic boycott and anti-foreign  teaching in  schools this  propaganda has been pushed to  such lengths that  it has&quot;contributed to creating the atmosphere  in which the present dispute broke out.     7. The use of  the boycott by  the  Chinese previous to the  events of  the 18th September, 1931, to  express their  indignation at  certain incidents or  tosupport certain claims could  not fail to make a  situation which was already tense still more  tense.     The use of  the boycott by  China, subsequent  to the  events of the  18th September, 1931, falls under the category of reprisals.     8.  The object of the provisions of the  Covenant  of  the League of Nations regarding  the settlement of  disputes is  to  prevent the tension between nations becoming  such that a rupture appears  to  be inevitable.   The Commission  of Enquiry found  that each  of the issues between China and  Japan was in itself capable of settlement by arbitral procedure.  It is precisely because  the accumula- tion of these issues increased the tension between the two  nations that it  was incumbent on the nation which regarded itself as injured to draw the attentionof the League of Nations to the situation when  diplomatic  negotiations were unduly protracted.     Article 12 of the Covenant contains  formal obligations as regards  the pacificsettlement of disputes.     9.  Without excluding the possibility that, on the night of the  18th-19thSeptember, 1931, the Japanese officers on the spot may have believed that they
were  acting  in self-defence, the Assembly  cannot regard as measures  of  self-defence the military operations carried out on that night by the Japanese troops at Mukden and other places in Manchuria.  Nor can the military  measures of japan as a whole, developed in the course of the dispute, be regarded as measuresof self-defence.   Moreover, the adoption of measures of self-defence does notexempt a State from complying with the  provisions of article 12 of the Covenant.    10. Since the  18th  September, 1931, the activities of the Japanese militaryauthorities, in civil as well as in military  matters, have been marked by essentiallypolitical considerations.  The  progressive military occupation  of the ThreeEastern Provinces removed  in succession all the important towns in Manchuriafrom  the control of the Chinese authorities, and, following each occupation, thecivil administration was reorganised.  A group of Japanese civil and militaryofficials conceived,  organised and carried through  the Manchurian independencemovement as  a solution to the situation in Manchuria as it existed after the events of the 18th September, and, with this object, made use of the names and actions of certain Chinese individuals  and took advantage of certain minorities  andnative communities that  had grievances against  the Chinese Administration.This  movement,  which  rapidly  received  assistance  and  direction  from  theJapanese  General  Staff, could only be carried through owing to the presence ofthe Japanese troops.   It cannot  be considered as a  spontaneous and  genuineindependence movement.    11. The  main political  and  administrative power  in the &quot; Government &quot; of&quot; Manchukuo,&quot; the result of the movement described in the previous paragraph,rests in the hands of Japanese officials and advisers, who are in a position actually to direct and control the administration; in general, the Chinese in Manchuria.who,  as already mentioned,  form the vast  majority, of the population, do not support this  &apos;: Government  &quot; and regard it as an instrument of the Japanese.It should also  be  noted that, after the Commission of Enquiry completed  itsreport and before  the report was considered by the Council  and the Assembly,&apos;&apos; Manchukuo &apos;&apos;  was recognised by Japan.   It has not been recognised by  anyother State, the members of the  League in particular being of opinion that suchrecognition was incompatible wdth the spirit of the resolution of the  11th March.    The situation  which led up to the events of the 18th  September, 1931,presents certain  special  features.   It was subsequently  aggravated  by  thedevelopment  of  the  Japanese  military  operations,  the  creation  of  the&apos;&apos; Manchukuo Government &apos;&apos;  and the recognition of that  &apos;&apos;  Government&apos;&apos;  by japan.  Undoubtedly, the present case is not that of a country which has declared war on another country  without previously  exhausting the  opportunities  for conciliation provided in the Covenant of the League of Nations;  neither is it a simple case of the violation of the frontier of one country by the armed forces ofa neighbouring country, because in Manchuria, as  shown by  the circumstancesnoted above,  there are many features without an exact parallel in other parts ofthe world.   It is, however, indisputable  that, without any  declaration of war, alarge part of Chinese territory has been forcibly seized and occupied by japanese troops, and that, in consequence  of this operation, it  has been separated from and declared independent of the rest of China.    The Council,  in  its resolution of the 30th September, 1931,  noted  thedeclaration of the Japanese representative that his  Government would continue,as  rapidly as possible, the withdrawal of  its troops,  which  had already beenbegun, into the railway zone in proportion a\s the safety of the lives and propertyof Japanese nationals was effectively ensured, and that it hoped to carry out this intention in full  as speedily as might be.   Further,  in  its  resolution of the10th December, 1931, the Council, reaffirming its resolution of the 30th September,noted the undertaking of the two parties to adopt all measures  necessary to avoid any further aggravation of the situation and to refrain from any initiative wdiichmight lead to further fighting and loss of life.     It should be pointed out in connexion wdth these events that, under article 10of the Covenant,  the members of the League undertake to  respect the territorial integrity and existing political  independence of all members of the League.     Lastly, under article 12 of  the Covenant, the members of the League agreethat,  if there should arise between them any dispute likely to  lead to a rupture.
              FART IV. STATEMENT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS.    This part sets forth the recommendations which the Assembly deems just and proper in regard to the dispute.                                 Section,  I.    The recommendations of the Assembly  take  into account the very specialcircumstances of this case and are based on the following principles, conditions and considerations :     (a) The  settlement of  the  dispute should observe  the  provisions of  theCovenant of the League,  the Pact  of Paris,  and  the  Nine-Power Treaty  of washington.    Article 10 of the Covenant of the League provides that &apos;&apos; the members of theLeague undertake to respect and preserve as against external  aggression  theterritorial  integrity  and existing political independence of all members of  theLeague.&apos;&apos;    According to  article 2 of the Pact of  Paris, &quot; the high contracting parties agree that the settlement  or solution of all  disputes or conflicts of whatevernature,  or  of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means.&quot;    According to article  1  of  the  Nine-Power Treaty of  Washington,  &quot; the contracting  Powers,  other than  China,  agree  to  respect  the  sovereignty,the independence,  and the territorial  and administrative integrity of China.&quot;    (b) The settlement of  the dispute should observe  the provisions of  Parts Iand II of the Assembly resolution of the 11th March, 1932.    In that resolution, which has already been quoted in this report, the Assemblyconsidered  that the provisions of the Covenant were  entirely  applicable to  thepresent dispute, more particularly as  regards     (1) The principle of a  scrupulous respect for treaties.    (2) The undertaking  entered into by members of  the League of Nations to           respect and  preserve  as against  external  aggression the territorial           integrity ;.and existing political independence of all the  members of           the League.    (3) Their obligation to submit any  dispute which may arise between them to           procedures for peaceful settlement.    The Assembly has adopted  the  principles  laid down by  the President-in-Office of the Council  in his declaration of  the 10th  December, 1931, and  hasrecalled the fact  that twelve members  of the Council had again invoked those principles  in their appeal to the Japanese Government on the 16th  February,1932, when they declared that no infringement of the territorial integrity and nochange in the political independence of  any member of the League brought aboutin disregard of article 10  of the Covenant ought  to be  recognised as  valid andeffectual by members of the League.    The Assembly has stated its opinion  that the  principles governing  inter-national relations and the peaceful settlement of  disputes between  members ofthe League above referred  to are in  full harmony  with the Pact  of Paris.Pending the steps which it might ultimately take for  the settlement of the disputewhich had  been  referred  to  it,  it has proclaimed  the   binding nature of  theprinciples  and pi&apos;provisions referred to above and declared that  it was incumbentupon  the members of the League not  to recognise any  situation, treaty or agree-ment  which might be brought about  by means contrary  to the Covenant of  theLeague of  Nations or to the Pact of Paris.they will submit the matter either  to arbitration or judicial settlement  or  toenquiry by the Council.    While  at  the origin of  the  state of  tension  that existed before the18th September, 1931, certain responsibilities would appear to lie on one side andthe other, no question of Chinese responsibility can arise for the development  ofevents since the 18th September, 1931.
    Lastly,  the  Assembly has affirmed that  it is contrary to  the spirit of theCovenant that the settlement of  the  Sino-Japanese dispute should be  soughtunder the stress  of military pressure on the part of either party, and has recalledthe resolutions  adopted  by  the   Council  on  the  30th   September  and  the10th December, 1931, in agreement with  the parties.    (c)  In order that a lasting understanding may be established between Chinaand Japan on the  basis of respect for  the international undertakings mentionedabove, the settlement of the dispute must conform  to the principles and conditions laid down by the Commission of Enquiry in the following terms :     &quot;1. Compatibility with the interests of both China and Japan.         &quot; Both countries are members of the League and each is entitled to claim    the same  consideration  from the League.  A solution from which both did    not derive benefit would not be a gain to the  cause of peace.    &apos;: 2. Consideration for  the  interests  of the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist             Republics.         &quot; To make peace between two  of the neighbouring countries without    regard for the interests  of the  third would be  neither just nor wise, nor in the    interests of peace.    &quot; 3. Conformity tvith existing multilateral treaties.         &apos;&apos; Any  solution should conform to the provisions of the Covenant of the    League of  Nations,  the  Pact  of Paris, and  the  Nine-Power Treaty of    Washington.    &quot; 4. Recognition of Japan&apos;s interests in Manchuria.         &quot; The  rights and  interests  of  Japan in Manchuria  are  facts  which    cannot  be ignored, and any solution which failed to recognise  them and to    take into account also the historical  associations of Japan with  that country    would not be satisfactory.    &quot; 5. The establishment of new treaty relations between  China and Japan.         &quot;A re-statement of the respective rights, interests and responsibilities    of  both countries in Manchuria in new  treaties, which shall be part of the    settlement by  agreement, is desirable if  future friction is to be avoided and    mutual confidence and co-operation  are to be restored.    &quot; 6. Effective provision for the settlement of  future disputes.         &quot; As a corollary to the above, it  is necessary  that provision should be    made for facilitating the prompt settlement  of minor disputes as they arise.    &quot; 7. Manchurian autonomy.         &quot; The Government  of Manchuria should  be modified in such a way as to    secure,  consistently  wdth. the  sovereignty and  administrative  integrity of     China,  a large measure of  autonomy  designed  to meet the local  conditions    and special characteristics of the Three Provinces.   The new civil regime    must be so constituted and conducted as to satisfy the  essential requirements   - of  good government.     &quot;8. Internal order and security against ^external aggression.         &quot; The internal order of  the  country should be secured by an effective    local gendarmerie force, and  security  against external aggression  should be     provided by the withdrawal of all armed forces other than gendarmerie, and .... by the conclusion of  a  treaty of non-aggression between the  countries     interested.     &quot;9. Encouragement  of an  economic  rapprochement  between China  and              Japan.         &quot; For this purpose a new commercial treaty between the two countries is  /desirable.  Such a treaty should  aim at placing on an equitable basis the     commercial relations between the  two countries  and bringing  them  into     conformity with their improved political relations.
11^1X0     &quot; 10. International co-operation in Chinese reconstruction.         &quot; Since the present political instability in China is an obstacle to friend-     ship with Japan and an anxiety to the rest of the world (as the maintenance     of peace in the Far East is a matter of international concern), and since the     conditions enumerated above cannot be fulfilled  without  a strong Central . -   Government in  China,  the  final  requisite  for a satisfactory  solution  is     temporary international co-operation in the internal reconstruction of China,     as suggested by the late  Dr. Sun Yat-sen.&quot;                                 Section II.     The  provisions  of  this section  constitute  the  recommendations  of  theAssembly under article 15, paragraph 4. of the Covenant.     Having defined the  principles, conditions and  considerations applicable  tothe settlement of the dispute,     The Assembly recommends as follows :-     1. Whereas the sovereignty over Manchuria belongs to China.     A.   Considering that the presence of Japanese troops outside the zone  ofthe  South Manchuria  Railway and  their operations  outside  this  zone  areincompatible with the legal principles which should govern the settlement of thedispute,  and that it is  necessary to  establish as soon as possible  a  situationconsistent with these  principles,     The Assembly recommends the evacuation of these troops.  In view  of thespecial circumstances of the case, the first object of the negotiations recommendedhereinafter should be to  organise this evacuation  and to  determine the methods,stages and time-limits thereof.     B.   Having regard  to  the  local  conditions  special  to Manchuria,  theparticular rights and interests possessed by Japan therein, and  the rights  and interests of third States,     The  Assembly  recommends  the  establishment  in  Manchuria, within  areasonable period, of an organisation under the sovereignty of, and compatible with the administrative integrity of, China.  This organisation should provide a wide measure of autonomy, should be in harmony with local conditions and shouldtake account of  the  multilateral treaties in  force, the particular rights  and interests of Japan, the rights and interests of third States, and,  in general, theprinciples and conditions reproduced in Section I (c) above; the determination  ofthe respective powers of and relations between the Chinese Central Governmentand the  local authorities should be made the subject of a declaration by theChinese Government having  the force of an international undertaking.     2.  Whereas, in addition to the questions dealt with in the two recommenda-tions 1.4  and IB,  the report of the  Commission of  Enquiry mentions in theprinciples and conditions for a settlement of the dispute  set out in Section I (c)above certain  other questions affecting the good  understanding between  Chinaand Japan, on which peace in the Far East depends,     The Assembly recommends the parties to  settle these questions on the basisof the said principles and conditions.     3.  Whereas  the negotiations necessary for  giving  effect to  the foregoingrecommendations should  be carried on by means of a suitable organ,     The Assembly recommends  the  opening  of  negotiations between  the  two parties in accordance with the method specified hereinafter.     Each of the parties  is invited to inform  the Secretary-General whether  itaccepts, so far  as it is concerned, the recommendations of the  Assembly, subjectto the sole condition that the other party also accepts them.     The negotiations between the parties should  take place with  the assistanceof a committee set up by the Assembly as follows : The Assembly hereby invitesthe Governments of(29) .... each to appoint a member of the  committee as soonas the Secretary-General shall have informed  them that the two parties  acceptthe  Assembly&apos;s&apos; recommendations.  The Secretary-General shall also notify theGovernments of  the  United States  of America  and of the  Union of  soviet socialist Republics of this acceptance and invite each of them to appoint a memberof  the committee should it so desire.

informed of the acceptance of the two parties, the Secretary-General shall  take all suitable steps for the opening of negotiations.    In order to enable the members of the League, after the opening of negotia-tions, to judge whether each of the parties  is acting in conformity with theAssembly&apos;s recommendations     (a) The committee will, whenever it thinks fit, report on the state  of thenegotiations, and particularly on the negotiations with regard to the  carryingout of recommendations 1A  and B above;  as regards  recommendation 1.1, thecommittee will in any case report within  three months of the opening of negotia-tions.  These  reports  shall be communicated by  the  Secretary-General  to themembers of  the League  and  to the non-member States represented  on  thecommittee.    (b) The committee may submit to the Assembly all questions relating to theinterpretation of Section II of  Part IV of the present report.   The Assemblyshall give this interpretation in the same  conditions as those in which the present report is adopted, in conformity with article 15, paragraph 10, of the Covenant.                                Section III.    In view of the  special circumstances of the  case, the recommendations madedo not provide for a mere return to the status quo existing before September 1931.They  likewise exclude the maintenance  and recognition of the existing regime in Manchuria, such maintenance and recognition  being  incompatible with thefundamental principles of existing international obligations and  with  the  goodunderstanding between the two countries  on which peace in the Far East depends.    It follows that, in adopting the present report, the members  of the Leagueintend to abstain, particularly as regards the existing regime in Manchuria,  fromany act wdiich might prejudice or delay the carrying out of the recommendationsof the said report.   They will continue not to recognise this regime either de jureor de facto.  They intend to abstain from taking any isolated action with regardto the situation in Manchuria  and to continue to concert their action  among themselves as well as with the interested  States not members of the League.  Asregards the members of the League who are signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty,it may be recalled that,  in accordance with  the provisions of that treaty:&apos;&apos; Whenever a situation arises which, in the opinion of any one of them, involves the application  of  the stipulations of the present treaty  and renders  desirablediscussion of  such  application,  there shall be  full and  frank  communication between the contracting  Powers concerned.&quot;    In order to facilitate as far as possible the establishment in the Far East ofa situation in conformity with  the recommendations of the present  report, thesecretary-general is instructed to communicate a copy of this report to the Statesnon-members of the League who are signatories of the Pact of Paris or of the nine-Power Treaty,  informing  them of  the Assembly&apos;s hope  that they willassociate themselves with the views expressed in the report,  and that they will,if necessary, concert their action and their attitude  with the members of theLeague.                                 ANNEX  1.      Proposals Made by the Japanese Government on January 21, 1933.                         (A) Draft Resolution No. 1.    The Assembly,    1.  Recalling that, according to the terms of article 15 of the  Covenant, its first duty is to endeavour to effect a settlement of the dispute and that conse-quently it is not at present called upon to draw up a report stating the facts ofthe dispute and its recommendations in regard thereto;    2.  Considering that, by its resolution of the 11th March, 1932, it laid down the principles determining the attitude of the League of Nations in  regard tothe settlement of  the dispute;    3.  Considering that the principles set forth in Chapter IX  of the reportof the Commission of Enquiry constitute  the useful basis for effecting such asettlement, and affirming that in such a settlement the provisions of the Covenant
                        (B) Draft Resolution No. 2.    The Assembly thanks the Commission of Enquiry appointed in virtue of the council&apos;s resolution of the 10th December, 1931, for the valuable assistance it hasafforded to the League  of  Nations,  and declares that its  report constitutes aninvaluable contribution to the efforts of the League for the maintenance of peace.                   (C) Draft Declaration by the President.    1.  The Assembly, in its resolution of the 9th December, 1932, requested itsSpecial Committee :          &apos;&apos; (1)  To study  the  report of  the  Commission  of Enquiry, the obser-    vations of the parties, and the opinions and suggestions  expressed in the    Assembly, in whatever form they were submitted;         &quot; (2)  To draw up proposals with a viewr to the settlement of the dispute    brought before it under the Council resolution dated the 19th February, 1932.         &quot; (3)  To submit these proposals to the Assembly at the earliest possible    moment.&quot;    2.  If  the committee had had to lay before the Assembly a picture of events and an appreciation of the general situation, it would have found the elementsnecessary for such a statement in the first eight chapters of the report of theCommission of Enquiry.    3.  But the time has not come  for such a  statement.  In  accordance  with article 15, paragraph 3, of the Covenant, the Assembly must first of all endeavourto effect a settlement of  the dispute by conciliation, and,  if  such  efforts are successful,  it  shall  publish  a statement  giving  such  facts as  it  may  deemappropriate.    4.  So long  as  the  efforts  on the  basis of  article 15, paragraph 3, arecontinued, a sense of the responsibilities placed on the Assembly  in the variouscontingencies provided for in the Covenant obliges it to maintain a particularreserve.  Hence, the committee has confined itself, in the draft resolution whichit is to-day submitting to the Assembly,  to making proposals with a view to thesettlement of the dispute:    5,  By the Assembly&apos;s resolution of the 11th March, the Special Committeewas instructed to endeavour to prepare the settlement of the dispute in agreementwith the parties.   .6.  For the practical work  of settlement it  is  proposed  that the SpecialCommittee should appoint   from among  its members  a  small  committed1 to       [8245]                                                        Fof the League of Nations, the Pact of Paris and&apos; the Nine-Power Treaty must be respected;                                                     v  ,4.  Considering that, in the best interest.of world peace, it is its duty todetermine how these principles can be applied to the development of the situationin the Far East:    5.  Decides that for this practical work of settlement the Special Committeeof Nineteen shall appoint from among its members a small committee to contri-bute towards a final and fundamental solution by the two parties of the questions at issue between them;    6.  Authorises this small committee to take such measures as it may deem necessary for the successful execution of its mission;    7.  Requests this  committee to  keep  the Special Committee of Nineteeninformed of its work, in order that  the  latter may lie able  to  report  to  theAssembly before the 1st March, 1983.    8.  The Special Committee of Nineteen will have power to fix, in agreementwith the two  parties, the time-limit  referred to  in the Assembly resolution&apos; ofthe 1st July, 1932;  should the two parties  fail to agree on the duration of sucha time-limit, the Committee will submit proposals to the Assembly on the subjectsimultaneously with the  presentation  of  its final  report regarding the taskentrusted to it by the Assembly under article 15, paragraph 3.    9.  The Assembly shall remain in session, and its president may convene itas soon as he may deem necessary.
contribute  towards a final and fundamental solution, by the two parties  of thequestions at issue between them.    7.  The small committee will have all the powers necessary for the executionof its mission.  In particular, it may consult experts and utilise their services.    8.  The members of the small committee will be guided as regards mattersof law by the principles of the Assembly resolution of the 11th March, 1932, and,as regards  matters of fact, taking into account the observations of the parties, bythe findings set out in the first eight chapters of the report of the Commission ofEnquiry.   As regards the solutions to be considered, they will seek them as laiddown in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution according to the principles set outin Chapter IX of the report of the Commission of Enquiry.    9.  The report of the Special Committee of Nineteen will be submitted to theAssembly, which  will take such decision as may be appropriate thereto. Further,in order that  the settlement of the dispute may.  not be made more difficult, theCommittee firmly expects, and I feel  sure that the Assembly will, agree, that no member of the League  will take action which is  not  in conformity with theprinciples contained in the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Pact of Paris,the Nine-Power Treaty,  its own  resolution of  the 11th March and  the presentresolution.                                 ANNEX  2.Memorandum of the Chinese Delegation proposing certain Amendments to the  Resolution and, Statement of Reasons drawn tip by the Drafting Committee.                                               Geneva,  December 26.  1932.                                     I.    1.  In the conversations which they had the honour to hold with the Acting-President of the Drafting Committee on the 16th December and with  certain members of the committee on the 17th and 18th December, the Chinese delegationdrew attention to the basis which they had stated in the Special Assembly to beindispensable for a just settlement and conveyed to them the disappointment ofthe Chinese Government at the  contents of the proposed draft resolution.   A few-essential modifications were suggested for the draft resolution and the statementof reasons, with a view to safeguarding the indisputable rights of China  and thefundamental principles of the Covenant and other peace  instruments.    2.  In order to facilitate reference and consideration, the Chinese delegationdeem it desirable to present their proposed modifications in the form of  amend-ments, with a word of explanation for each.  These  following amendments are presented with special consideration for the effort  at conciliation, and withoutprejudice to  the original requests of the Chinese Government as stated in theSpecial Assembly, upon which  they reserve the right of insisting:     (A.) That the fourth paragraph in the  draft resolution No.  1 be amended             to read :         &quot; Decides  to set  up  a committee whose duty  will  be  to conduct, in    conjunction with  the parties, the negotiations  with a view to a  settlement,    guided by the findings of essential facts set out in the first eight chapters of the    report of the Commission of Enquiry, and on the basis of the principles laid    down in its aforesaid resolution of the 11th March, 1932, and those set out    in Chapter IX of the said report, taking special note that the maintenance    and recognition of the present regime in Manchuria cannot  be regarded as    a solution.&quot;    (B.) That the ninth paragraph in the same draft be amended  to read :         &quot; The committee will have power  to fix, in agreement  with the two    parties, the time-limit referred to in the  Assembly resolution of the 1st July,    1932; should the two parties fail to agree on the duration of such a time-limit    the  committee, simultaneously with the presentation  of  its   report, or the    Special Committee of Nineteen, will submit proposals to the Assembly for    a time-limit which, if it is necessary to make a report  as provided for under   . paragraph 4 of article 15 of the Covenant, shall not exceed one month from    the  date of such  submission.&quot;
    (C.) That the last paragraph of the &quot; Statement of Reasons &quot; be amended             to read :         &quot; In this connexion the Committee of Nineteen considers that, in the    special circumstances which characterise the dispute, while fully respecting    the sovereignty and the territorial  and administrative  integrity  of China,    a mere return  to the de facto  condition previous to September 1931 would    not suffice to ensure a- durable settlement, and  that the  maintenance and    recognition of  the present regime in Manchuria  could not be regarded as a    solution.&quot;                                     II.    3.  The  addition of the phrase &quot; guided  by the findings  of  essential factsset out in the first eight  chapters of the report of the Commission of Enquiry &quot;is intended to preclude  a debate on questions of  facts  relating  to the origin,development  and  present character of the situation in Manchuria.  These factshave been authoritatively ascertained  by the Commission of Enquiry, and want of mention in the di*aft resolution might give rise to  a renewed discussion about them which could not serve any useful purpose.  In fact, the League of nations had deliberately  deferred its  efforts  to effect a  final settlement of  the Sino-Japanese conflict in order to await  an impartial account from the Commisson ofEnquiry of the relevant  facts involved in the  Manchurian situation.  Now this account is  available to the League.  If  it is to be overlooked or not to be fullyutilised as the definite basis of facts  in the present  attempt to find a solution,then all the delay in the  past, which has entailed upon China a terrible sacrificein lives lost, property destroyed and more territory invaded, has been meaninglessand unwarranted.    4.  It is believed, however, that,  far from wishing to undermine the valueof the essential  findings of the report relating  to Manchuria,  the  drafting committee&apos;s  intentions  generally  correspond  with  the  views of  the  Chinesedelegation, as reference is made to these findings  in the Statement of Reasons.For these considerations, therefore,  it appears necessary to make specific mentionin the text of the  draft resolution itself.    5.  The  inclusion of the principles  laid down  in the Assembly resolution ofthe 11th March, 1932, in the basis for a settlement of the Sino-Japanese conflict isnecessary.  The reference to the same resolution in the second  paragraph of thedraft  resolution,  while  useful, is not sufficiently  clear as to its  purport.  The11th March  resolution of the  Assembly, not  only enunciates the fundamentalprinciple of non-recognition of any situation, treaty or agreement brought about by means contrary to the Covenant of the League and the Pact of  Paris, but alsorecalls the  continuing validity  of the  Council  resolutions of  the 30th september and the 10th December, 1931, to both of which China attaches great importance.In any  settlement the execution of these resolutions of the Assembly  and theCouncil, which unquestionably  remain in full force, should, in the opinion of theChinese delegation, constitute an essential and  preliminary consideration.    6.  The emphasis laid upon the clause that  &quot; the maintenance and recognitionof the present regime in Manchuria cannot be regarded as a solution &apos;&apos; is dictated by the fact that  it embodies a fundamental principle of the sanctity of inter-national peace instruments.  The Covenant of  the League and the Pact of Parisboth  enjoin  the peaceful settlement  of international disputes,  while  the nine-Power  Treaty of Washington specifically obligates the  signatory partiesto respect  the sovereignty,  the independence,  and the territorial  and adminis-trative integrity  of China.  It was clearly in consideration of the paramount importance of  preserving the sanctity  of these  instruments  that the SpecialAssembly enunciated the principle of non-recognition in its  resolution of the11th March,  1932, referred to above.  The  Commission of Enquiry,  too,  hasstressed this point  in its report.   Any equivocation  on this point would  be interpreted by the world as a surrender on the part of the League of one of themost  fundamental  principles of its establishment  and existence.  The Chinesedelegation  desire to state clearly that, for  their part, an explicit provision forthe non-recognition and non-continuation of the present regime in Manchuria isan indispensable condition to their participation in  any  procedure looking to afinal settlement.[8245]
i    7.  It is  proposed to omit reference  to  Chapter X of the report of theCommission of Enquiry because the suggestions contained therein, to quote thewords of the report, &quot; are intended as an  illustration of one way in which theconditions we have laid down in the preceding chapter might be met.&quot;   Theyare not necessary or indispensable  elements of a  fair  and practical solution.Besides,  in the  view of the Chinese  Government, several  suggestions areobjectionable in principle,  while others, if adopted, would be difficult of executionin the light of the existing circumstances.                                    III.    8.  The second amendment is proposed with a view to elucidating two points which the  Chinese delegation  believe to be of importance.   The  fixing  of atime-limit is a constitutional question, proposals for the determination of whichit is incumbent upon the League members alone to submit.  For this  purpose theCommittee of  Nineteen would be the  competent  body  to make  suggestions,especially as the Special Assembly in July last has expressly entrusted  it withthis duty.  But, according to the text of the draft resolution under consideration,it would appear to be the Special Committee to be set up which would be expectedto submit proposals on the subject.  A change of wording such as suggested inthe amendment under discussion would  not only meet the point but also  serve to make clear  that the creation of the  proposed  Special Committee does not prejudice the  continued existence of the Committee of  Nineteen nor affect its functions and duties entrusted to it by the Special Assembly other than those nowto be delegated to the Special Committee.    9.  The fixing of a definite period  of time within which a report under paragraph 4 of article 15 of the Covenant shall be made is considered especially important  for the double purpose of securing an early settlement of the  Sino-Japanese conflict and ensuring that  this significant  safeguard  provided in theCovenant may not be  further  impaired.  The  Chinese  delegation  believe thatthe framers of the  Covenant, which is clearly intended to be of universal applica-tion, were not unaware of the possible rise of complicated issues, and they provided the maximum  period of six months for making  a final report with that purpose in view.  Only such a safeguard could inspire a sense of security that a breach of this organic law of the League, wherever arising, would be speedily dealt withand redress for the suffering party might be obtained without undue delay.                                    IV.    10.  The amendment to the final paragraph of the  Statement of Reasonsconsists in inserting the clause, &quot; While fully respecting the sovereignty and theterritorial  and  administrative integrity  of China,&quot;  and  replacing  the  word&quot; that &quot; with  the  phrase &quot; de facto.&quot;  The  purpose of  this  proposal  is toemphasise  a distinction of which the Drafting  Committee has undoubtedly been already aware, between the de facto and the de jure character of the status quowrite.   While the Chinese Government has  no  objection to effecting,  of its own accord, desirable changes in the administration of Manchuria as it existed priorto September 1931, it cannot admit or agree that China&apos;s legal position  in herThree Eastern  Provinces should in any wfyy be prejudiced in any  settlement ofthe Sino-Japanese conflict.  The proposed  addition, it is believed, will help to clarify this point.    11.  The Chinese  delegation trust that the Committee  of Nineteen will seeits  way to accept and  incorporate  in the final  text  of the draft resolution andStatement  of Reasons the amendments which  are herein above presented and explained and  which the Chinese Government  deems essential.  They also wishto add that they reserve the right of suggesting additional amendments on further study or if other changes are made in the two  texts as originally communicatedto them.

If the  committee had had to lay before  the Assembly a picture of events andan appreciation of the general situation,it  would  have found  all the elementsnecessary for such a statement in thefirst eight chapters of the report of theCommission  of  Enquiry, which in  its opinion constituted a balanced, impartial-tial  and  complete  statement  of  theprincipal facts.it  would have found  all the elementsnecessary for  such a statement in thefirst eight chapters of  the report ofthe Commission of Enquiry, which inits  opinion constituted  an invaluablecontribution to the efforts of the Leaguefor the maintenance of peace.B.

The members of the NegotiationsCommittee will be guided  as regardsmatters of law by Parts I and II of theAssembly resolution of the 11th March,1932, and as  regards matters of fact bythe findings  set out in  the first eightchapters of the  report of the Commis-sion  of  Enquiry.    As  regards  thesolutions to  be considered,  they will seek them on the basis of the principles set  out in Chapter IX of the  report ofthe Commission  of Enquiry and havingregard  to  the  suggestions   made  in chapter X of the said report.

DRAFT RESOLUTION No. 1.
 Draft of the Committee of Nineteen.  9. In this connexion the Committeeof  Nineteen  considers  that,  in  thespecial  circumstances  which  charac-terise the dispute, a mere return to theconditions previous to September  1931would  not suffice  to  ensure a  durablesettlement, and that the maintenance and recognition of the present regime in Manchuria could not be regarded asa solution.        Amendment proposed.  9.  In this  connexion the Committeeof Nineteen notes that Japan has recog-nised the present regime established in manchuria and  that no other  memberof the League has done so.  It is  to  be noted that the report ofthe  Commission of Enquiry states, in chapter IX,  the principles and conclu-sions  of   which  the   Assembly   hasadopted in paragraph  4 of the resolu-tion  as the basis of the negotiations fora settlement,  that  a mere return to theconditions  previous to  September  1931would not suffice  to ensure a  durablesettlement, and  that the maintenance and  recognition of the present regime in Manchuria could not be regarded asa solution, and also that a satisfactoryregime for the future might be evolvedout  of  the present one  without  anyviolent change (page 130).                                 ANNEX  4.   Letter addressed by the Secretary-General to the Representative of Japan                  on behalf of the Committee of Nineteen.                                                 Geneva, February 9, 1933.    The Committee  of  Nineteen considered most carefully the new proposalswhich your Excellency submitted to it yesterday.  The committee desired me  toexpress  to your Excellency its sincere appreciation  of the efforts made by theJapanese Government to meet the committee&apos;s views.    There is, however, one essential point on which the committee desires furtherinformation.  The Japanese Government declares its willingness to accept as thebasis of conciliation the principles and conclusions set out in Chapter IX of theReport of the Commission of Enquiry.  Principle 7 of that report is as follows:     &quot;7. Manchurian Autonomy.         &apos;&apos; The Government in Manchuria should be modified in such a way as to    secure, consistent^  with the sovereignty  and administrative integrity  of    China, a large measure  of autonomy designed to meet the local conditions    and special characteristics of the Three Provinces.  The  new civil regime    must be so constituted and conducted as to satisfy the essential requirements    of good government.&quot;    The committee therefore assumes that, as by the acceptance of this principle the Japanese Government recognises that the, continuance of the existence of the&quot; Manchukuo,&quot; which it has recognised as an independent  State, cannot afford asolution of the present dispute, it agrees that when the Committee of Conciliationmeets its task will be to find a solution, which, while being neither the continuanceof the &quot; Manchukuo,&quot; nor the return to the previously existing state of affairs,will secure, consistently with the sovereignty  and  administrative integrity  ofChina,  good order in Manchuria, and the  proper protection of Japanese rightsand legitimate  interests in Manchuria.    The committee would be grateful if your Excellency would inform it at theearliest  possible moment if it  has correctly  interpreted  the  attitude of theJapanese Government in this vital question.C.
&apos;     1                  Letter from the Representative of Japan.                                                Geneva, February 14, 1933.    I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of  your  note of the 9th instant,regarding the proposed resolution and the draft  declaration by the presidentunder discussion in the Committee of Nineteen.    In reply I beg to state that the point you raise is one on which the JapaneseGovernment have made repeated and unequivocal declaration, and on which  I myself have taken pains to make full explanations to you, to the president of theCommittee of Nineteen, and to the  Council and the Assembly of the League ofNations, not only verbally but also in writing.    In my explanations, I laid emphasis on the point  that while the JapaneseGovernment were not in a position to have their recognition  of the independence of Manchukuo made a subject of contentious discussion, they would nevertheless be able, I  was and remain confident, to make the world  understand the fairnessand unassailable character of their position, provided that ample time were givenfor the thorough explanation of  this and other relevant  points.   I understood from you that the members of the Committee of Nineteen had been fully apprisedof the tenor of our conversations, and  that  there could  be no misunderstandingon their part of the Japanese attitude in this matter.    I would further call your attention to the fact that  the time when theCommittee of Nineteen  expressed  their  agreement  to the  deletion from theproposed resolution and draft declaration by the president of the portion relatingto the invitation of non-member  States, while expressing the  wish that theJapanese  Government would see their  way to accepting the  rest, you andthe president of the Committee of Nineteen made to me, on the 18th January last,a suggestion that the Japanese Government might make an ex-parte declarationor reservation in elucidation of Japan&apos;s attitude in regard to the last paragraphof the draft declaration by the president.    I was then given to understand that  the Committee of  Nineteen  would not object to Japans taking such a course.  The suggestion, I am confident, would never have been made  if  the  Committee of Nineteen had not acquired a  clearconception of Japan&apos;s position as regards  the question raised by your note underacknowledgment. But it was  not only  made, but was actually confirmed, by theofficial communique of the 4th February.    The Japanese Government have no objection to inclusion in the draft resulu-tion  and  declaration of the principles of  Chapter IX of the Report  of theCommission of Enquiry, on the understanding that they will  be applied with due regard to  the actual development of events, and with like regard to the principlethat  the  very nature  of conciliation  involves an  impartial  abstention   fromprejudgment of thedssues.    In taking this conciliatory stand, the Japanese Government have naturallybeen acting on the assumption that the Committee  of Nineteen were fully aware of their attitude in the matter namely, that the Japanese Government are con-vinced that the maintenance and recognition of the independence  of Manchukuoare the only guarantee of peace in the Far East and that the whole question will eventually be solved between Japan and  China on that basis.   They have alsoentertained  throughout a just expectation that the Committee of  Conciliationwould give ample time to have these and  other points fully  explained, and thatthey could finally convince every impartial mind of the justice and moral strengthof their position.    I trust that  from the above the standpoint of Japan  as regards the subject ofyour enquiry has been made clear, and I may add that  the Japanese  delegationalso  sincerely appreciate the efforts which you and the Committee of Nineteenare exerting in the matter.
Letter addressed by the Secretary-General to the Representative of Japan  on                     behalf of the Committee of Nineteen.                                                 Geneva, February 14, 1933.    The Committee of Nineteen desire me to acknowledge the receipt of  your letter of the 14th February.    The committee is grateful for the statements contained in that letter, whichindicate the attitude of your Government as to the &quot; Manchukuo.&quot;    Your communication makes it clear that the Japanese delegation, in acceptingas a basis for the settlement of the dispute the ten principles and conclusions  setout in Chapter IX of the Report of the Commission of Enquiry, intended that theadditional words  proposed by  the delegation,  &quot;applying  such principles and conclusions  to the  events which have developed,&quot; should modify the scope  ofPrinciple 7. The committee understands that, if a Committee of Conciliation hadbeen constituted, the Japanese representative at  such a committee would not, infact, have been prepared to accept, as part of the basis of its work, that, as statedin the Report of the Conunission of Enquiry, the  maintenance and recognition ofthe existing regime would not afford a satisfactory solution of the Manchurianproblem.  This being so, the committee, to its deep regret, feels bound to hold thatthe Japanese proposals put forward on the 8th February do not afford an accept-able basis for conciliation.   The  committee has  given  full consideration to thevarious points raised in your letter, but in the circumstances it does not feel thatto enter into a discussion of them could lead to any fruitful result. The committeeis, of  course, willing to examine with the greatest care, up to the date of the finalmeeting of the Assembly, any further proposals which your Government may wishto make, but the committee feels sure that your Excellency will realise that anyaggravation of the existing situation must render more difficult, if  not indeedfrustrate, fresh efforts  at conciliation.
