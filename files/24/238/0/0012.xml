COPY KO......CP.43(33).                CAEISET .            Report  of  Committee  on Ministers * Powers.                 memorandum  by minister  of Health .                    I have  considered the memorandum of the         Lord Chancellor on  this subject (C .P.44(33)) .                    The ministry  of Health is perhaps more concerned         in it than any  other single Department of State, by reason         of the number of  regulations needed to meet the changing         conditions of the millions insured under the National Health         Insurance  and Contributory Pensions Scheme and of the very         large part which  local  enquiries, Involving judicial and         quasi-judicial  issues,  now play in local government.                    A note  is appended dealing with some of the more         important  Issues  at stake.                    I raise no objection to the Lord Chancellor&apos;s         proposal for  a  Cabinet  Committee.   But it will be most        - difficult  in  the  course of a busy Parliamentary session to         find time  to  deal properly with issues of the degree of         gravity and complexity  of those indicated in the note, and         I trust the effective labours of the Committee may be deferred,         at all events,  till the end of the session.                               (Intld.) E. H. Y.23rd February, 1933
119                            NOTi,                    elegated legislation.          The Committee proposes to set up new and additionalStanding Committees in each House as regards Bills whichdelegate powers  (pages 67 and 68) and Regulations (pages63 and 69).          Government Bills and Private Members Billstogether may amount to as many as 150 in a Session, very many of which delegate powers.   The hulk of regulationsalso is very great.   Those issued by the Ministry of Health,and the Department of Health for Scotland, alone, in the last five years, occupy on the average over 350 pages of an annualvolume of Statutory Rules and Orders.          What would be the effect on parliamentaryaaministrative business of the proposed additional committee stage for all this mass of Bills and Regulations?          As regards Bills, it is difficult enough inpresent conditions to secure the passage of Government measuresthrough the Commons in time for proper consideration by the lords.   The accumulation of business in the Upper Housetowards the end of a session is a long-standing grievance.The intrusion of the new Committee before Second Readingwould make the position worse than ever, adding materially  tothe difficulty cf passing Government measures to the statute book.          The recommendation in the Report is that both in regard to Bills and Regulations, consideration by the-proposedCommittees should be restricted to &quot;principles&quot; and should  not cover &quot;merits&quot;.   The distinction seems too subtle to meenanything in practice.   The Committees would be driven hy
contending interests to consider policy and merits.   thus in the case of Bills they would be doing the work which wouldhave to be done over again later on the regular committee stage.   In the case of Regulations, the Committees wouldbecome in effect -the administrative regulation-makingauthority, an undesirable function for Committees of thelegislature.          The present position is that Parliament lays down principles and gives the responsible Minister power towork out those principles by regulation.   That power canbe controlled and limited as Parliament thinks fit by the text ^f the Bill and it is customary further to provideexpressly for the power of annulment of regulations by resolution.   The system works well and it is not clear why it should be disturbed on purely theoretical grounds.           Judicial and quasi-judicial functions.          In regard to this part of the Report, I find thegreatest difficulty in understanding how the recommendationscould be applied to the very diverse operations of myDepartment.          In the first place on a matter of general principle,the Report defines a class of cases in which the minister should not act as judge because he has a &quot;departmentalinterest&quot; (pp. 78, 116):     and it bases its recommende.tibnson this classification.   This seems to me quite fallacious.The &quot;interest&quot; of any and every department is surely toprotect the interest of the public;  and if a Minister takesany other view about his department&apos;s interest, the appropriateremedy is, not to limit his powers, but to get rid of him.
1(\ A61          But the major difficulty with the Report here againis how to make its  recommendations work in practice.          On pages 73, 74 and 116, the Report, afterdistinguishing between judicial and quasi-judicial functions,admits that the latter involve elements of administrativepolicy for which the Minister alone must be responsible.In such cases it recommends that the preliminary judicialfunction of ascertaining fact should normally be discharged byan independent tribunal,  the Minister being left to take thedecision on policy (page 79).   The implication is that the two parts of the process are severable.  I suggest that in practicethat is not so;  and that in fact the whole must be dealt withas one single process.  *          This part of the Report produces on my mind thevery clear impression that in dealing with legal considerartions the Committee have paid too little regard to the needs and difficulties of day-to-day administration.              Publication of Inspectors&apos; Reports.          The pros and cons of this difficult matter are fully and fairly set out in the Report (pages 100-107).    My own view, contrary to the view of the Committee,  is that while incertain cases publication is obviously right, normally reports*          The county reviews no1// proceeding under the LocalGovernment Act, 1929, provide a typical illustration.   Inthese cases the Minister has to approve pr-proposals of a countycouncil&apos;for rearranging the boundaries of urban and rural districts and parishes in the county.   If anything is to beleft to the sphere of administration it may be allowed thatthese functions are administrative I     cabinet here there is idirect clash of interests between bodies of ratepayers, large sums of money are at stake, and the  procedure by way of local inquiry for ascertaining the facts and hearing the parties isin practice identical with that for  dealing with judicial andquasi-judicial decisions of similar  importance.  How is it possible to distinguish in such a case between issues of factand issues of policy?
should be confidential, the practice of giving finally a reasoned decision of the Minister to those concerned beingexpanded to the utmost.          If Inspectors&apos; reports are published, the practical effect will be to transfer the real power to decide cases fromthe Minister responsible to Parliament to the Inspector.  It is undesirable thus to fetter a Minister&apos;s discretion, and ineffect to transfer his authority to a subordinate.                        Cost.          I do not perceive any reference to the question of cost.    &quot;We are pressed on all sides to reduce expenditure.Acceptance of these recommendations must increase itmaterially.   The publication of Inspectors&apos; reports meansmore (and more highly paid) inspectors.   The submission to  aCommittee of regulations on the scale on which they are requiredin this Ministry means more staff, legal and administrative.The setting up of tribunals to deal with judicial andquasi-judicial functions opens up a wide field of professional,and especially legal, expenditure, the extent of which it isdifficult to forecast .   I should submit that this aspect ofthe matter calls also for further enquiry.                       General.          These are so.&quot;e of the major considerations which appear to me to arise on the report.  The general conclusion towhich I come is that the report pays too little heed tocertain practical parliamentary and administrative aspects,which, before we are committed to acceptance, ought to receivefurther attention.          In conclusion, although deeply sympathetic with the historic and constitutional ideas that inspire the campaign
against the extension of ministerial powers,  I confessto a deubt whether these recommendations are not on the wrong lines of policy.   Departments it is said have too much power.   Be it so:  then the remedy is to give themless work to do, or at any rate not to give them more.It is no remedy to deny then adequate means of performingthe work that you do require of them.  Departments&apos; powers,it is said, grow at the expense of parliament and the courts.It may be:  but again, the remedy is to limit the work required of them.  It is no remedy for parliament and thecourto to seek themselves to perform the administrativebusiness incidental to the work required cf the departments.If they do, they will have no time for their proper business.
