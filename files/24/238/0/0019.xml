This Document is the Property of Kis. Britannic Majesty&apos;s                       Government.                    0 A B I IT E T.     MSMOIAIMJII W THE SEQRETARY OF  STATE FOP  ETDIA.     The India Committee has examined in detail  the draft white Paper circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 49. Mycolleagues on that Committee and I have  made a number of changes, with which, since they are  either purely verbalor raise no important question of principle, we  do notthink it necessary to trouble the Cabinet.  We wish,however, to call attention to the following points:-   1. Paragraph 5 of the Proposals.   Aden.  We propose      to alter, in deference to the  vie.vs of the      Government of India, the wording of the  last sub-      paragraph of this paragraph to the following form:-           &quot;The Settlement of Aden is, at present, a      Chief Commissioner^ Province.  The future      arrangements in the Settlement  are, however,      under consideration, and accordingly no  proposals      in respect of it are included  in this document.&quot;           The Cabinet agreed, in principle, on  22nd      February, that the balance of  advantage  rests with      the separation of Aden from India  and that His      Majestyfs Government should be  prepared  to relieve      India of the contribution at present paid  by them      towards military and political  expenditure there.MOST SECRET.C.P.49A.Copy No.
The Government of India, on the result of thediscussion in the Cabinet being oonmiunicated  tothem, have urged that a decision should be postponed until His Majesty&apos;s Government can  more fully appreciate the nature and effect of the newConstitution;  that, meanwhile, Aden should remainin British India and be administered through  the reserved Department of External Relations;  andthat, if possible, no allusion to its futureshould be made in the White Paper:   but that, ifanv allusion is made, it should be  of an anodvne  1/........ 9                        %Jcharacter.  Ah immediate decision to separatewould, in Lheir view, have very unfortunatereactions.     The Cabinet Committee consider it essentialto make some reference to Aden in the V5hite paper and are of opinion that the compromise proposedin the formula quoted above affords a reasonable solution.       Settlement of differences between the       Chambers of the Provincial Legislatures       where these are bicameral.We propose to alter the first sentence ofparagraph 92 of the Proposals to the followingform, thereby bringing this paragraph into line with the corresponding paragraph 41 relating  to differences of opinion between the  two chambers of the Federal Legislature, and to  adopt, as  thesecond sub-paragraph of paragraph 41, the sameformula mutatis mutandis as appears in the  Printin the second sub-paragraph of 92;
March 9, 1933.Re-draft of paragraph 92.        &quot;In the case of a Province  having a Legislative   Council,  the Governor w ill &quot;be empowered in any   case in which a Bill passed &quot;by one Chamber has   not, within three months thereafter,  been passed   by the other, either without amendments or with   agreed amendments, to summon the tvio  Chambers to   meet in a Joint Session for the  purpose of reaching   a decision on the Bill.  The members  present at a   Joint Session will deliberate and vote together   upon the Bill in the form in which it finally   left the Chamber in which it was introduced and   upon amendments, if any, made therein by one   Chamber and not agreed to by the other.  Any such   amendments which are affirmed by a majority of the   total number of the members voting at the Joint   Session will be deemed to have been carried,   and if the Bill, with the amendments, if any,   so carried, is affirmed by a majority of the   members voting at the Joint Session,  it shall be   taken to have been duly passed by both Chambers.        In the case of a Money Bill, or  in cases   where, in the Governors opinion, a decision on tha   Bill cannot consistently with the fulfilment of any   of his &quot;special responsibilities&quot;, be deferred,   the Governor will be empowered at his discretion   to summon a Joint Session forthwith.&quot;        I propose to give my colleagues  my   recommendations on other points  orally.
