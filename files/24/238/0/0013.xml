124        fcTSMORANDUM BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR                    on the   Reocx&apos;t of the Committee cn Ministers&apos;  Fevers.     Some time ago Lord Hewart published a &quot;book entitled&quot;The Hew Despotism&quot;.   As might he expected coming from him, it was cleverly written, but it was biassed and,in certain respects, ill-informed and wrong.     After a good deal of pressure, I appointed the donoughmore Committee to go into the matter,  and they held a great number of meetings.   The members were nearly all experts, and when Donoughmore1s health unfortunatelyforced him to retire from the chairmanship, Leslie Scottfinished the enquiry and produced the report.    Strippedof a good deal of verbiage, the object of the enquiry  wasto see how a constitutional democracy can be  safely and efficiently worked.     Cn the legislative side.    Having regard to thegreat amount of social legislation nowadays and its
125intricate character, it is impossible for Parliamentto deal fully and accurately with details.   A greatdeal of legislation must not only necessarily be done,but is better done, by delegation, though the risks of this are obvious and safeguards have to be provided.The real value cf the Report is that it makes a numberof practical recommendations ah out the necessarysafeguards.   These involve (a) reserving the supremacyof Parliament, and (b) respecting the liberty cf thesubject.   I am far frsm saying that I agree with allthe recommendations, but they will have to be carefully considered.   So much for the legislative side.     On the judicial sido.     It must be recognised,and the Committee have recognised, that the creationof   specialised tribunals is necessarily incidental to much modern legislation.    Generally speaking, ourcourts have hitherto had to deal with cases between individuals and/or companies and corporations, &quot;out the
128result of modern legislation is that manyquestions have to &quot;be decided which, although theydo hot concern single individuals, concern classesof individuals which are more appropriately dealtwith administratively than by the ordinary procedure of a court of lav/.   Here again, however, it isnecessary to provide safeguards to protect thesubject (a) in regard to Delegated Legislation,against the subordinate authority exceeding thepowers conferred by Parliament;  (b) in regard toquasi-judicial cr administrative decisions, to keepthe Ministers or Tribunals within their authorisedlimitsj and (c) to preserve the rights of appeal on questions of lav/.   The Committee have expressed their opinion oh these heads, and I again guardmyself by saying that although I am net in agreementwith all of them, they will have to be carefully considered.                         -3-
127       In dealing with these quasi-judicial decisions,the Committee have, however, in my opinion, beencareful not to fetter the administration unduly, but their Report does discuss the principles to be observedand provides certain defined safeguards.  So much forthe judicial side.       On both branches of the enquiry, the Reportpreserves the jurisdiction of the King&apos;s  Bench, andsuggests simplification in legal procedure,  It attachesgreat value to publicity, and adds that in cases ofdelegated jurisdiction the practice of discussing rounda table the proposed legislation with the interests affected is highly desirable.  It suggests a particularsafeguard as to delegated jurisdiction by the modificationcf Standing Orders of the Houses of Parliament, and thata Committee of each House should examine all delegatedjurisdiction and see that it is within the ambit of theStatute, and it further recommends that to every bill which creates such delegated jurisdiction the ministers should attach a memorandum drawing attention to theprovisions.                          -4-
                                                     1.4 0        The above is necessarily a very short and concisesummary of the Report.   We shall, I think, be compelledto make up our minds how to deal with it, for I foreseethat it may create considerable difficulties for manyDepartments, especially that of Local Government,,   In my view, however, it weald be impossible to rush the -matterand to come to decisions which we might subsequently regre&apos;t.I strongly urge that nothing should be done this side ofthe Long Vacation.   During the Vacation many ministers will be away, and it will not be feasible to do anything,,I hope, however, that on our return in October or Novembera Cabinet Committee will he appointed to consider the report and advise the Cabinet on its recommendations.   I needhardly say that the matter is one of great importance forthe future constitutional development of our present political system, and it involves a careful considerationof many difficult legal and political questions.

REPORT.SECTION I.-INTRODUCTORY.                      Appointment, &amp;c.  1. We were appointed  by your Lordship&apos;s minutes of- the 30th Terms ofOctober, 1929, and 7th November,  1929,  to consider the  powers reference.exercised by  or under  the  direction of  (or by persons or bodiesappointed specially by)  Ministers of the Crown by way of (a) dele-gated legislation and (b) judicial or  quasi-judicial decision,  and toreport  what  safeguards are  desirable or necessary to  secure  theconstitutional principles of the sovereignty of Pazliament and the supremacy of the Law.  Of the original members of the Committee, the Earl of Clarendon Personnelresigned on his appointment as Governor-General of  the  Union of Com-of South Africa, the Duchess of Atholl, the Rev. James Barr,  and mittee-the Countess  of Iveagh, who was appointed an additional member on the  14th January, 1930, resigned on account of pressure of other work.  In  April,  1931, the Earl of Donoughmore unfortunatelyfound it necessary for reasons of health to resign the Chairmanship,though retaining his membership.

Eobson : Justice and Administrative Law  (Macmillan,      1928). ,  It was early  evident to us that criticism was directed chiefly to three main points :     (a)  Statutory powers conferred  on Ministers  to make regula-          tions, rules or orders  which, when made, might be held          to have been placed  outside the purview of the Courts          by virtue of a provision in the enabling Act supposed to          have that effect.    (b)  Statutory powers so conferred to  amend  existing Acts of          Parliament or even the enabling Act itself in order &quot; to          remove difficulties &quot;  or to  bring the provisions of  the          Act  into operation.    (c)  Statutory  powers  of judicial or quasi-judicial  decision          against which there is no appeal.Accordingly we asked all Departments to send us (i) an exhaustivelist of  all powers of  the kind  indicated  under (a),  (b)  and  (c);(ii) examples of the various types of regulation, rule or order makingpower, selected by reference not to  the subject matter, but to theform and procedure prescribed,  and to the safeguards applicable;(iii) examples of types of judicial or quasi-judicial decisions whichare subject to appeal.  Statements of fact  only were asked for and not  expressions ofopinion.  The  Departments went to much trouble in  complying with our request and  we are greatly indebted to them.  These Departmentalmemoranda which contain  much  valuable information  will  befound in the first of the companion volumes to our Report.

Ministry of  Health, the Ministry of  Transport and the Board of           Trade.  It was clearly unnecessary to take oral evidence from all           Departments,  and  we selected these  three  because  of the great           extent of  the powers of the Ministers in charge,  and  of the large           number of points at  which those Departments are in touch  with           the public, i  We also heard the following official witnesses :                Sir Maurice Gwyer, K.C.B., K.C.,  H.M.  Procurator  General                  and Treasury Solicitor,

(Editor of Statutes Revised, Statutory      Rules  and Orders,  etc.,  and  author of the  book above-      mentioned),and we received written or oral evidence from the following persons or organisations :     (1)   Sir Dennis Herbert, K.B.E., M.P.,      Mr. W. A.  Robson (Barrister  at  Law and Lecturer  in        Industrial and Administrative Law at the London School        of Economics and Political Science),       The late Earl Russell,       Mr. Joshua Scholefield, II.C.

We invited  the Lord Chief  Justice, the author of &quot; The New Despotism,&quot; to give evidence,  but he replied that as we had read his book  and he had at present nothing to add  to it, he did not think he  could be of further assistance to the Committee.   The evidence was heard in public and is printed in the second of the companion volumes to this report.  A few of  the witnesses  did not wish to supplement their written memoranda with oral evidence, but in these  as in the other cases the wiitten memoranda have been treated as the evidence-in-chief.  In all we held 54 meetings  at 22 of which oral evidence was taken.   We have  embodied in the evidence volume of our  proceedings only  such of  the statements received by us as seemed to bear directly on the subject matter of our enquiry.   We desire to express our thanks to all  those  who  furnished statements and memoranda, as  well  as to the witnesses mentioned above, for the trouble taken on  our  behalf.Otherwitnesses.1 The London Chamber of Commerce agreed with this evidence.
  We have  not regarded  it  as  within our functions to reviewdecisions in  particular cases  by or on  behalf of  Ministers of  theCrown which are, or have been, the subject of dispute or complaint.  Thinking that on some points some of the official witnesses might feel  difficulty in  expressing  their personal views  in public,  weintimated that we were ready to hear them in private on any suchpoints.  But in  no case did any official avail himself  of this offer.All our evidence was taken  in public.                       Division of Enquiry.  4.  Our report follows the natural division of our subject into two separate  parts,  (a) delegated  legislation,  (6)  judicial  or  quasi-judicial decision.  The  first  is dealt with  in Section II and  thesecond in Section III.separation of powers isreal but notrigid.Delegationnot con-fined to ministers.general conclusions                     General Considerations.   5.  There are a few general considerations to be stated.  In the British Constitution there is no such thing as the absolute  separa- tion of legislative, executive, and judicial powers; in practice it is inevitable that they should overlap.  In such constitutions as those of France and the United States of America, attempts to keep them rigidly apart have  been made, but have  proved unsuccessful.  The distinction is none  the  less real,  and  for our  purposes important. One of the main problems of a modern democratic state is  how to preserve the distinction, whilst avoiding too rigid an insistence on it, in  the wide borderland where it is convenient to entrust minor legislative and judicial functions to executive authorities.  It is customary to-day for Parliament to delegate minor  legisla- tive powers to subordinate authorities and bodies.   Ministers of the Crown are the chief repositories of such  powers;  but they are con- ferred also, in differing degrees,  upon Local Authorities,  statutory corporations and companies, Universities, and representative bodies of solicitors, doctors and other professions.   Some people hold the view that this practice  of delegating legislative powers is unwise, and might  be dispensed with altogether.   A similar view  is held with regard to the delegation to Ministers by statutory authority of judicial and quasi-judicial functions.   It  has even been suggested that the practice of passing such legislation  is  wholly bad,  and should be forthwith abandoned.  We do not think that this is the considered view of most of those who have investigated the problem, but  many  of them would  like the practice curtailed as  much as possible.  It may be convenient  if on the  threshold of our report we state our general conclusion on the whole matter. We  do not agree  with those critics who  think that the practice  is wholly bad.We  see in  it definite advantages,  provided that  the  statutory powers are exercised and the statutory functions  performed in the
134ri&quot;ht  way.  But risks of abuse are incidental to it, and we believe-that safeguards are required, if the country is to continue to enjoy the advantages  of the practice without suffering from  its inherentdangers.   But in truth whether good or bad the development of the practice Delegationis  inevitable.   It is a natural reflection, in the sphere of constitu- inevitable.tional law, of  changes in  our ideas  of government  which have resulted from  changes in political, social and economic ideas, and of changes in the circumstances of our lives which have resulted fromscientific  discoveries.  In  this connection we call attention to thefollowing passage in the Report (June, 1931) of the Committee onFinance and  Industry : 2       &quot; The  most  distinctive  indication  of the change of outlook    of the government of this country in recent years  has been its    growing preoccupation, irrespective of party, with  the manage-    nient of  the life of the people.   A study of the Statute Book    will show  how profoundly the  conception of the function of    government has altered.   Parliament  finds  itself  increasingly    engaged  in legislation which  has for  its conscious aim  the    regulation of the day-to-day affairs of the community, and now    intervenes  in matters  formerly  thought to be entirely outside    its scope.  This  new orientation has its dangers as well as    its merits. Between liberty and  government there  is an age-     long  conflict.   It is of vital importance that  the new  policy,     while truly promoting  liberty  by  securing  better  conditions    of life  for the  people of this country,  should not, in its  zeal     for interference, deprive  them of their initiative  and indepen-     dence which  are the nation&apos;s  most valuable assets.&quot;   In this passage, Lord Macmillan&apos;s  Committee calls attention to the principal  danger inherent in this new policy.   We are  con- cerned rather with the  danger incidental to the particular method by which the  new policy is carried out,  namely,  the practice of entrusting  legislative and judicial  functions  to  the   Executive.   It  is, as Professor Dicey  pointed  out  in  &quot; The  Law of  The Legislative Constitution,&quot;  3 futile  for  Parliament to  endeavour  to  work out Powers in the details of large legislative changes.   Such an endeavour only    &apos; jta&quot;ds results in  cumbersome and prolix  statutes, and  the  evil is so Executive apparent that in modern times Acts of Parliament constantly  con- tain   provisions  empowering the Privy  Council,  or one  of the Ministers of the Crown, to make regulations under the Act for the determination of details which cannot be  settled by Parliament.&apos;1   a Cmd. 3897 of 1931. Part  I, Chapter I,  paragraph 8, pp. 4 and 5.   3 8th Edition (1915), p. 50.   1 John Stuart Mill in 1861 in his &quot; Representative Government &quot; (chap. 5,      p. 235 of Everyman&apos;s Library edition), went so far as to assert &quot; But      it is equally  true, though only of late  and slowly beginning to be      acknowledged,  that  a  numerous  Assembly is as little  fitted for the      direct business  of legislation as for that of administration.&quot;
             Yet  the practice, useful and necessary  as  it  is, does  to  some           extent entail an  abandonment by Parliament  of its  legislative           functions.   The  details which are  left to be determined by the           Privy  Council5  or a Minister may closely affect  the rights and           property of the subject, and  even  personal  liberty.   There  is  at           present  no effective machinery for  Parliamentary  control  over           the many regulations  of  a legislative character which are  made           every  year  by Ministers in pursuance  of  their  statutory powers,           and the consequence is that much of the most important legislation           is  not really considered and approved by  Parliament.  This may           or may not make  for efficiency ; but its extent is plainly an innovations-           tion in  constitutional  practice.Judicial      Experience has also shewn that in  the  course  of  delegatingH^handl   *nese  verv wide  powers  to Ministers  Parliament often entrusts0j tne      them  or persons  appointed  by them  with  the  right  and dutyExecutive,  to  take  decisions,  which   determine  the  rights  of  private           persons  and deprive them of  their access to the  Courts  of  Law.           It cannot,  we think,  be denied that  primd facie  this involves  an           infringement of  that   rule  of law  which  is  &quot;a  characteristic           of the English Constitution.&quot;6   In  this  context we may  quote           a statement of the ideal of justice which should  always be an aim           of British  statesmanship : T/ie ideal of        &quot; Amid the cross-currents  and shifting sands of public  life                the Law is like a great rock  upon which a man may set his                feet and be safe, while the inevitable inequalities of private life                are not so  dangerous in a country  where every  citizen knows                that in the Law Courts, at any rate, he can get justice.&quot; 7              We do not doubt that in the exercise of the judicial and  quasi-           judicial powers of Ministers justice is as a general rule substantially           done; but  it  should always  be  remembered that  justice  is  not           enough.  What people want is security for justice, and  the only           security for justice is Law, publicly administered.justice.5 Powers given to His Majesty to be exercised by Order in Council are    exercised by the King at a meeting of His Privy  Council.  The King    holds such meetings from time to time.  Summonses  are sent out    by the Lord President of the Council to a few Privy Councillors.    The rule  of practice requires the presence of three, and the Clerk    of the  Council  must attend  to  attest the document.   The Order  is    expressed to be made by His Majesty by and with the  advice of His    Council and  is signed by the Clerk of the Council;  see The Con-    stitutional History of England by F. W.

135  Great stress has been laid on this public need by the Lord Chief A quotation.Justice in &quot; The New Despotism &quot; at pages 48 and 49 :-         . inn the      &quot; How is  it to be expected that a party  against whom a justice,    decision  has been  given in a  hole-and-corner  fashion,  and    without  any grounds being specified, should  believe that he    has had justice?  Even the  party in whose  favour a dispute    has  been decided must,  in  such circumstances, be tempted    to look upon the result as a mere piece  of luck.   Save in one    or two  instances,  none  of  the Departments publishes  any    reports of its proceedings, or the reasons for its decisions, and    as the proceedings themselves,  if any,  are invariably held in    secret,  even interested  parties  have  no  means  of  acquiring    any  knowledge  of what has taken  place, or  what course the    Department  is  likely to take  in  future cases  of the  same    kind  that may  come before  it.  A Departmental tribunal is,    however, in  no way bound,  as a Court of Law  is,  to  act in    conformity with previous decisions, and this fact is commonly    regarded as one  of the reasons for the policy of secrecy.  Others    may  think  that the Department is afraid to disclose  incon-    sistencies and a want of principle in its  decisions.  However    that may be, the policy is fatal to the placing of any reliance    on the impartiality and good faith of the tribunal.  It is a queer    sort  of justice that will not bear the light of  publicity.&quot;  We regard this passage, and indeed the whole of the Lord Chief  NecessityJustice&apos;s  book,  as a warning against  possible dangers of  greatgravity towards  which  he&apos; discerns  an existing tendency to drift.  sa&apos;eauar s-We are very much alive both to  the presence of such dangers andto their gravity if not checked, and have considered them through-out our enquiry.   But, as appears from our  considered view in thenext  two sections of our Report, we  see nothing to justify anylowering  of  the country&apos;s  high opinion of  its  Civil Service orany reflection on its sense of justice,  or any ground for a belief that our  constitutional machinery is developing in directions whichare fundamentally wrong.  Our Report draws attention  to certain parts of  that  machinery  which are  capable  of  improvement,and certain  aspects of its  working where  specific safeguards are needed.   At the same  time we  say deliberately  that there  is no ground for public fear,  if the right precautions are  taken.   none the less the public should be grateful for outspoken criticism, evenif exaggerated; and we think that the  critics whose warnings and it may  be attacks led up to our  investigations performed  a useful service.
                   SECTION II.-DELEGATED  LEGISLATION.                      Preliminary The &quot; Separation of Powers.&quot;             1. The subject  of delegated legislation cannot be  fully under-           stood without a knowledge of the constitutional relations between           the  Legislature and the Executive in England.   We therefore           begin  Section  II  with  some observations upon the principles  of           our Constitution and its development.The          Ifc is generally  agreed that Montesquieu is the  main author  of so-called    ^ne theory of the separation of powers.5  There is no doubt thatof l&quot;owert&apos;1       tneory was  suggested  to  him by  his  interpretation of thein the      mechanism of our  Constitution.   But his  theory, as  he statedBritish     it,  is  a very  incomplete   and  to  some  extent  a  misleadingConstitu-   account of that  mechanism; and both  in  the United States  oftwn.       America and in France it has given rise to constitutional develop-           ments which are still further removed from the mechanism and the           law of the English Constitution.             In the eighteenth century the fact that the powers  of the State           were shared between the King, Parliament, and the Courts, and the           fact that the powers of the Legislature  were shared  between the           King, the House of Lords and the House of Commons, were the           most  obvious  features  of the English  Constitution  and  English           constitutional law,  and the  most  obvious  contrasts to  the despotic           and centralised monarchical governments of  the  Continent.             All through the  eighteenth  century,  this  division of powers in           the constitution  was  regarded  by statesmen, lawyers  and political           writers as its leading characteristic9.  But these men, when they           dwelt upon this feature of  the English Constitution,  were simply           describing an obvious phenomenon. Montesquieu  gave a new turn           to  their observations  when he  elevated them to the rank of  a new           and  a universal  constitutional principle, by maintaining that it           was  to this  separation of  the powers of  government that  the            English people owed their  liberty.              In  fact, though there was  no  doubt a division  in the powers            of  government in  the  English Constitution,  it was  by no  means            a clear-cut division.  This  is  obvious  from  a  very  cursory  glance            at a few  elementary facts.  In the sphere of central government              8 The following passage  in his &quot; De L&apos;Esprit des Lois,&quot; Bk. XI, Chap. VI                  (Oeuvres  Completes de   Montesquieu:   Edouard  Laboulaye:  Paris,                  1877: Vol. 4, p. 81), contains the essence of his theory:                      &quot; Lorsque  dans  la memo personne  ou dans le meme corps de                  Magistrature la  puissance  legislative  est  reunie  a la  puissance                  executrice, il n&apos;y a point de liberte, parce qu&apos;on peut craindre que                  le meme  monarque ou  le meme senat ne  fasse des lois tyranniques                  pour les executor tyranniquement.  II  n&apos;y a point encore de liberte                  si la puissance de juger  n&apos;est pas separee  de la puissance legislative                  et de l&apos;executrice.&quot;               0 Some of the authorities for this statement are collected in L.Q.R. XLV                  445-6 in an  article  by Sir William Holdsworth.
136the Crown was and still is  an essential part of the Legislature;and in the eighteenth century  the  Crown was  able, whenever itwished to do so, both  to initiate legislation and  to  exercise a con-siderable influence on the contents of  Bills pending in the two houses of Parliament.   The House of  Lords  was and still isa part of the judicial as well as of the legislative machinery of theState. Some of the privileges of the House of Commons gave and still  give  to  it  some  of  the characteristics  of  a Court  of  Law.The  Courts, by  means of the prerogative writs,  exercised and stillexercise an  administrative control,  under judicial forms, over  allsubordinate  jurisdictions, amongst  which  was  included  in  theeighteenth century the whole machinery of local government.  Inthe sphere of local government,  the lines  between  the differentfunctions of government were not merely blurred but disappeared.Quarter and  Petty Sessions in town  and country  alike exercisedlegislative, executive  and  judicial  functions.   Professor   Levy-Ullman,  in  his very able  book on Le  Systeme Juridique  deVAngleterre  (1928:  Vol.  i. p. 376)  has  very truly  said thatMontesquieu  has  drawn his  picture of  &quot;la  brumeuse  Angleterreet les Anglais du fond de ses vignes bordelaises,  sous  le clair  soleilde sa G-ascogne,&quot;10 and  that &quot; L&apos;Angleterre n&apos;est pas la  patrieclassique de la separation des pouvoirs.   Chaque pouvoir y a recusa physionomie particuliere san cesser de conserver les  (? des) traitsdes autres.&quot;11  It   was not so  much  the separation  of  powers which  was  acharacteristic feature  of the  English Constitution, as  the fact thatthe machinery both of local  and of central  government consisted of officials and  bodies possessing a large  measure of  autonomy.In the sphere  of  local government, Quarter and Petty Sessions,Borough  Corporations, and Poor Law authorities; in  the sphere of central government, such Departments of State as the  Exchequerand the offices connected with  the  revenue,  the offices connectedwith  the  Navy  and Army,  and the offices  of  the Secretaries ofState were left to carry out their duties in their own  ways, subject only to the legislative control of Parliament  and to the control ofthe law  as  interpreted by  the Courts.  * Subject to  that  control,these officials  and  bodies possessed  independent powers of action,and a capacity for development upon their own  lines.  Blackstone  judicialwas  much nearer than Montesquieu to the  truth  when he  said12  indepen-&quot; herein  indeed consists  the  true excellence of the English govern-  dence.ment, that  all  the parts of it form  a  mutual  check  upon eachother &quot; ;  and that  &quot; in this  distinct and separate existence of the 10 &quot; Misty England and the English as  he sat beneath his Bordeaux  vines,      in the bright sunshine of his  own  Gascony&quot;. 11 &quot; England is not the classic home of the separation  of powers.  Each      power there has taken on a character  peculiarly its  own whilst at      the  same time preserving features of the others &quot;. 12 Comm. i. 154 (12th Edition).
Dcvelop-ment ofadmiiiistra-tive author-ities.           judicial power in a peculiar body of men, nominated indeed, but           not removable at pleasure,  by the Crown, consists one main pre-           servative of the public liberty.&quot;&quot;             The fact  that these officials and  bodies  had this  large measure           of autonomy enabled them to  develop  on their  own lines  under           the exigencies of the duties entrusted to them; and  in the course           and as part of that development they were free to make rules  for           the discipline of their members and  for  the better ordering of           their  business.   Thus, the Courts and both Houses of Parliament           acquired clerical staffs,  and  made  their  own rules of procedure           by virtue of their inherent powers, without the need for any statu-           tory authorisation.  The departments of the executive government           developed in the same  way;  and many of the units of  the. local           government, in town  and  country, acquired  a more  elaborate           organisation  and   assumed    new   powers   without   statutory           permission.14             This power to develop  freely on their  own lines, and  to  use           freely the administrative powers which  they assumed, subject only           to  the  control  of  Parliament and  of  the common  law, is a           phenomenon which is apparent in  all parts of the  mechanism of           the English Constitution local and central from  a very  early           period in its history.   Nowadays  new  mechanism  is more  often           created by statute than evolved from a  modification  and an expan-           sion  of  old  institutions; and the  powers  needed  by  the new           mechanism  thus created are  likewise given by statute.  But  the           powers given by modern statutes are often essentially  similar to           the powers  which were assumed by many organs of  government at           an  earlier  period.  One illustration is  the right of the Courts to           make rules of procedure.  This authority, which  was assumed by           the Courts in the eighteenth  and earlier centuries, now rests upon           a statutory  basis and is exercised by a Joint Committee of Judges,           Barristers and Solicitors known as the Bule Committee.Early        As compared  with the nineteenth  and twentieth  centuries,  thetnstances^oj Legislature, in  the eighteenth  century,  was  sparing in  the  gift e ego. ion.  ^ those statutory powers,&quot;either of  the  judicial or of the legislative           kind, which are the subject of  our  enquiry, and  in  the creation of           new  organisations.   But  there are  instances  in the eighteenth           century in  which  these powers were given (i) to officials, and (ii)           to the Crown; and though the extent and the mode of the exercise             13  Comm., 1. 269.            &quot;  Sidney and Beatrice Webb (now Lord and Lady Passfield) have  pointed                 out in their book on Local  Government, vol. i, 480-3, that,  in the                 course of the eighteenth century,  Quarter Sessions, though originally                 a court exercising  its  powers under  judicial forms,  had developed                 executive and  legislative in  addition  to  its  judicial functions;  and                 that &quot;these developments were extra-legal in character; they vere                 neither initiated  by Parliament nor sanctioned by it &quot;.

I, c. 2.of these powers were sometimes attacked, the attacks failed, be-cause it was realised that  powers of this kind were essential to the effective conduct of the government.   (i) The  Acts  relating  to the customs and  excise  gave judicial (0 Taxation.powers to the  Commissioners of Customs and Excise.15   Black-stone, though he admitted the necessity  for these powers,  said thatin consequence  &quot; the power of these officers of the Crown over theproperty of the  people is  increased to a very formidable height &quot; ;&quot;the  opinion  held of  the  Commissioners of Excise by the general public is reflected in  Johnson&apos;s definition of the term &quot; Excise &quot; ;&quot;and their  arbitrary powers were complained  of in  the  House ofCommons.   In  1786 and  1790 proposals were made in the Houseof  Commons that,  in certain proceedings taken  by  these  Com-missioners, the  defendant should have the option of being tried bya  jury;&quot;  and, in 17S9,  that,  in actions against excise officers forillegal acts,  it should not be  possible  to plead a conviction in barof the action.&quot;   But these proposals were  rejected  because it was realised that the summary procedure by  which they exercised then-judicial powers  was necessary  for  the  efficient collection  of  therevenue.&quot;0  In 1785 the Commissioners for stamp duties were given power to do acts necessary for putting in force the  duties imposed on post horses and carriages,21 and in certain cases to make regula-tions for effectually securing the duty on such carriages.&quot;2   (ii) The Mutiny Acts  afford an  even more striking instance of (jj) Armydelegated legislation  at an early date.   In 1717 there appeared on and Navy.the Statute &quot;Book,  in the  shape of  the  Mutiny Act for  the year,what Professor  Maitland  called as. good an example of  delegatedlegislative  powers as he knew.23  The  first Mutiny Act was passed in 16S921 and the practice soon  became  settled of passing such an act in every year.  But the Act of  1717&quot; was the first which gave the Crown express authority to make and constitute, under His SignManual, Articles for  the better government of His Majesty&apos;s forces as well within the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland as beyondthe seas and inflicting pains  and penalties to  be proceeded upon
            to sentence or judgment in Courts Martial to be constituted  pur-            suant to the Act.  This became a standing clause in the Act&quot; and            formed a subject of Parliamentary controversy on the ground  that            it vested in the  Crown the sole legislative power over  the  Army.            In 1749 the controversy was settled by the insertion of the words :            &quot; Provided always that no person or persons shall be adjudged to            suffer any punishment extending to life or  limb by the said Articles            of War within the Kingdom of  Great Britain and  Ireland  except            for such crimes  as are expressed to be punishable by the Act &quot;.&quot;            The clause as further modified  is still to be found on  the Statute           Book in the shape of Section 69 of the. Army Act&quot; which now applies            to the  Air Force as  well as to  the Army.&quot;             In the case of  the Navy, on the other hand, the Articles of  War            have been specifically enacted by Parliament ever since 166130 and            are  now  contained in  the Naval Discipline Act.11   The contrast            afforded by the respective Navy and Army methods is  striking in            two ways.  It shows how the practice of  delegated legislation has            grown up without any preconceived plan or logical system : and also            that Parliament  may delegate  in one case while  not  delegating            in another without any obvious reason for differentiating between            the two.   In this  particular  case the probable explanation  of the            difference  between  the  methods is  that  Paidiament regarded the            Navy as a permanent institution and therefore  took the trouble to            make a code, whereas it  regarded the Army  as a  temporary evil            and  therefore left matters to be  regulated by the Crown during the            short period for which Parliament licensed a Standing Army.Control by    The  exercise of  these powers  was subject to the control  of thethe Courts   Courts, the intervention of which could  be invoked, if the persons and its      Qr ]30^ies to whom  they were entrusted exceeded the authority con-            ferred upon them  by the  statute.  But  the  Courts  recognised the            need not to fetter unduly  their  autonomy.  Thus,  in  the case of            Sutton  v.  Johnstone&apos;2 Lords  Mansfield and Loughborough gave it            as their opinion that one  member  of the Navy  had  no right of            action  against another, for malicious prosecution before a .Court            Martial, even if the plaintiff could  prove malice  and the absence            of reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution.&quot;            &quot; In a slightly  stiffened form: &quot;and to erect  and constitute Courts                Martial with power to try  hear and determine any crimes or  offences                by such Articles of War and inflict penalties by sentence  or judgment                of the same.&quot;              22 Geo.

  But it should be observed that the ambit of the powers of theseolder officials and bodies was determined by the common law,  andthat the powers given to the newer statutory bodies were fixed bythe statute.   They had no power to vary the common law or thestatute;  and the Courts could always interfere if the limits defined by the common law or statute were overstepped.   The chief if notthe only clear instances in  which, before ithe nineteenth century,Parliament seems to  have given  a power of  delegated  legislation in such general terms that it was in effect unlimited, or  so vaguelylimited,  that the  control of  the  Courts over its exercise  was eitherwholly or partially ousted,31 are first an enactment concerning theStaple made  in 1385,&quot;  secondly Henry VHPs Statute of  Sewers,1531,&quot; thirdly Henry  VIII&apos;s  Statute of Proclamations,  1539,&quot;fourthly Section 59 of Henrv VHPs Statute  of  Wales  (1542-3),&quot;and fifthly two Statutes of 1536  and 1547.30  With  regard to these statutes the following facts  must be borne in mind.  The enactment concerning  the Staple was passed  at  atime when the legislative procedure of  Parliament was not fixed inits  final  form, and when  ithe King was still regarded as playing themost important part in the  enactment of statutes.   It was not till the beginning of  the fifteenth century that the Commons expresslyclaimed to be both assentors to as well as petitioners for legisla-tion.&apos;u   The  Statute  of  Sewers  gives to the  Commissioners ofSewers  not  only  legislative powers,  but also  powers to rate land-owners, and to distrain and to impose penalties for non-payment ofrates.  These powers are given to them by the Commission whichis set out &quot;in Section 2  of ithe Act.   The Act  then goes on to pro-vide  in  Sections  6 and 7 that  all  Statutes, Acts and Ordinancesheretofore made by Commissioners of Sewers  &quot; not being  contraryto  this  present  Act  nor heretofore repealed  &quot;  are to  &quot;be  good and  effectual  for ever,&quot;  and that Commissioners hereafter to benamed  &quot; have full power  and authority to  make  constitute  andordain laws, ordinances  and decrees, and further  to do  all and51 In such cases, if the power given is unlimited,  the Courts cannot say     that  any  exercise of the power  is Tbeyond the competence  of the     person or body to whom the power to legislate has been delegated;     while if the power is only vaguely  limited it is difficult for the Courts     to do this. We discuss  such provisions further in paragraph 8.35 &quot; Quod Stapula  teneatur in Anglia;  sed in quibus erit locis, et quando     incipiet, ac de modo et forma regiminis  et  gubernationis ejusdem,     ordinabitur postmodum  per  consilium domini regis, auctoritate par-     liamenti:  et  quod id quod  per dictum consilium in hac parte  fuerit     ordinatum, virtutem parliament  habeat et vigorem.&quot;  It  is not  to     be  found  in  the statutes, but in the Rolls of Parliament III 204;     it is cited by Stubbs,  constituencies.

everything mentioned in  the  said  Commission  .  .  .   and  thesame laws and ordinances so  made, to reform repeal and amend,and  make new from time  to time as  the  cases  necessary shall require in that behalf.&quot;   The statute thus delegates  to  the Com-missioners legislative powers,  taxing powers and judicial  powers.Moreover it anticipates in another form the modern device of requir-ing a further sanction for Acts and  Ordinances which are to havea permanent legislative effect.  Sections 16  and 17  provide  thatthe Acts  and Ordinances  of the Commissioners are to have effectonly for the duration of the Commission&apos;&quot; unless they are certifiedinto the  Chancery  and receive the royal assent.   Henry  VIII&apos;sStatute of Proclamations  enacted that the King with the advice of His Council could issue  proclamations which  should have  theforce of an  Act of  Parliament.4&quot;  But this Statute  (which hada  very short  life)13 especially  provided that the  common  law,(statute law,  and  rights  of  property  could not  be affected  byproclamations issued by virtue  of the Act.  Section 59 of the statute of Wales goes a great deal further, since it gives the King power tomake laws for Wales which &quot; shalbe of as good strengthe vertue andeffecte as  if they had been hadde and made by authorities  of Parlia-ment.&quot;  It was repealed in 1624.**  Probably it was meant to be atemporary power given to  facilitate the introduction of  Englishinstitutions into Wales.  The statutes of 1536 and 1547, which were repealed&quot; in 1751,authorised the successors of Henry VIII and Edward VI,  if  theysucceeded  to the throne while still under age, to repeal  by letters patent, on attaining the  age of  24, Acts  of Parliament  passed between  their  accession  to  the  throne  and  their attainment of that age.  Such  a power is, according to our modern ideas, a power of  delegated legislation.  But it was not so regarded in thesixteenth  century.   It was regarded as an ordinary  application ofthe medieval doctrine that  an  infanfs position ought not to  be prejudiced by acts  done during his minority.  It is essentially thesame idea which led Henry III to insist, when he  attained  fullage, that   &quot; all charters granted in  his name during his minorityrequired  confirmation, even  the  Great  Charter and the  Forest 41 The duration under the Statute was  three years unless sooner deter-     mined by the King.

The repeal of the statute of 1547 -would  in 1751 or         at any time before 1850, when the law on the point was altered         by statute, have ipso  facto revived the statute of  1536 if Parlia-         ment had not simultaneously repealed the statute of 1536 for the         second time.)
Charter&quot;;&quot;  and  since the  same  idea reappears in Henry  VI&apos;sreign,47 it is not surprising that it should have emerged again in thesixteenth  century.  It will be observed that, with the exception  of the Statute of the ComparisonStaple, all these instances come from the Tudor period a period, y^&apos;&apos;16like  the nineteenth  and twentieth  centuries, when great political, period.social and economic  changes were taking place.  We think  that theappearance of  statutes which  delegate large legislative  powers at both these periods is more than a coincidence, and that it confirmsour conclusion that  the delegation of  legislative powers is at thepresent day inevitable. Similar needs have given rise at these twovery different periods to a similar expedient.                  What delegated legislation is.  2.  The  word &quot; legislation &quot; has grammatically  two meanings the operation or function of legislating : and the laws which resulttherefrom.  So too  &quot; delegated legislation&quot;  may  mean  eitherexercise by a  subordinate authority, such as  a Minister, of thelegislative power delegated to him by Parliament; or the subsidiarylaws themselves, passed  by Ministers in the shape of Departmentalregulations and other statutory rules and orders.  In our terms ofreference  the phrase is used in the former sense; we are asked toreport on the activity or  function : and we have to consider whetherit is good or bad, avoidable or unavoidable, what limitations, if any,can or should be put upon it, what safeguards should be attached toits exercise. But obviously judgment of the function must be guided by  investigation   of  results  in past  and  present  constitutional practice ; and it has therefore been a part of our task to examine our national output of subsidiary laws.  That  output has been  and  isvast.   Mr. Carr,  the official  Editor of  &quot;  Statutory  Rules  and  The greatOrders,&quot; in his book on Delegated Legislation describes the position  ^j&quot;&quot;aeie^jso happily that we cannot do better than quote  him :               legislation.      &quot; Blackstone gave currency  to the  artificial  division of    English law into lex scripta and  lex  non scripta.  With the    latter we  are not now  concerned.  The former the written    law has been again divided into three  parts.   The first and    now  far the smallest part is made By the Crown under what    survives of the prerogative.  The second  and weightiest  part    is made by the King in Parliament and consists of what we call    Acts  of Parliament.  The third and bulkiest part is made by*&apos; Pollock and Maitlaria Hist.

                such persons or bodies as the King in Parliament entrusts with                legislative power.   It is with  this last  part  that  these pages                will deal.  It is directly related to Acts of Parliament, related                as  child to parent,  a growing child  called upon  to relieve  the                parent of  the strain of  overwork, and capable of attending to                minor matters while the parent manages the main business.                  &quot; In mere bulk  the  child now dwarfs the parent.   Last                year, while 82  Acts of Parliament wrere placed on the Statute                Book,  more than  ten  times as many  &apos; statutory rules   and                orders &apos; of a public character  were  officially registered under                the Rules Publication  Act.    The  annual  volume  of public                general statutes for 1920  occupied  less than 600 pages;  the                two volumes of statutory rules and orders for the same period                occupy above five times as many.  This excess  in mere point                of  bulk of delegated legislation over  direct legislation  has been                visible for nearly thirty years.&quot;48The absence   Delegated legislation  takes  many forms.   With the haphazardof system.   habit characteristic  of English  political life the constitutional prac-           tice has grown up gradually, as and when the need arose  in Parlia-           ment, without any  logical system.  The power  has been delegated           by  Parliament for various reasons,  because, for instance,  the topic           involved much detail, or because it was  technical, or  because  the           pressure of other demands upon Parliamentary  time  did  not allow           the  necessary  time to be devoted  by the House of Commons to           the  particular  Bill.  The limits of delegated power, the methods           of  Ministerial procedure, and the  safeguards  for  the protection           of  the  public  or the preservation  of Parliamentary control thus           appear  often to have been  dictated by opportunist considerations,           peculiar to the occasion.             As a  natural consequence  the choice of terminology has  also been           accidental; and the nomenclature  of delegated legislation is con-           fused.  The Act of Parliament which delegates the  power may in           so many words lay  down that &quot; regulations,&quot; &quot; rules,&quot; &quot; orders.&quot;           &quot; warrants,&quot;   &quot; minutes,&quot;  &quot;  schemes,&quot;  &quot; bye-laws,&quot;   or  other           instruments for  delegated legislation  appears  under  all  these           different names may be  &quot;  made &quot; or &quot;  approved &quot;  under defined&quot; &quot; Delegated Legislation,&quot;  p.  2.  This  was written  in  1921.  In his     evidence (Memorandum,  loth Day),  to  your Lordship&apos;s Committee,     Mr. Carr. gives the annual totals of statutory rules and orders from     1894 to 1929, and  says &quot; it is  significant,  and perhaps surprising,     that the tide lias now ebbed back to a pre-war mark.&quot;The con-fusion ofnomencla-ture.
conditions.&quot;   On the other hand the statute may merely authorisethe Minister to &quot; prescribe &quot; or  &quot; approve &quot; certain requirements,or to  &quot; appoint &quot; a  day, or  &quot; fix &quot; some standard,  but  give nodirections about the  particular  method  or form to be adopted in framing his decision; he  may even be left  free to perform  his  pre-scribing, approving, appointing,  or fixing by an ad hoc decision perhaps even informally  in  the course of correspondence withoutany obligation  to formulate it  in general terms as  a legislativeregulation.50 49 Well  known  modern  examples are:          (1) The  Defence  of  the Realm  (Consolidation) Regulations,  1914,              made by  His  Majesty in Council under tho Defence of the              Realm (Consolidation)  Act, 1914 (5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5,  c. 8).        (2) The Rules of&apos;the Supreme  Court, which are made by  the  Rule              Committee, and now derive their authority from the Supreme              Court of  Judicature  (Consolidation)  Act,  1925 (15 &amp; 16              Geo.  5, c. 49).        (3) The  Public  Assistance Order, 1930, made by the Minister of              Health under  the Poor Law Act, 1930 (20 &amp; 21  Geo.  5, c. 17).        (4) The  imperial and foreign  Post  Warrant,  1930,   made by the              Treasury  on  the representation  of tho Postmaster General              under the Post Office  Acts, 1908  to 1920 (8 Edw.  7, c. 48;              5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5,  c. 82; 10 &amp; 11 Geo.  5, c. 40).        (5) Minute (entitled the Education  Authorities  (Scotland) Grant              Regulations, 1930) made  by the  Scottish Education Depart-              mcnt under Section 21 of the  Education (Scotland) Act,  1918              (8 &amp; 9 Geo. 5, c. 48).        (6) Scheine  dated May 2nd, 1930, made  by the Board of Education              with the consent of the Treasury under the Teachers (Super-              annuation)  Act,  1925  (15 &amp;  16 Geo.  5, c.  59), relating to              teachers in the employment of the Air Council.        (7) Rye-Laws  and Regidations made  by the London  Midland  and              Scottish  Railway Company xinder the Railway Clauses  Cbn-              solidation Act, 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Viet., c. 20), with the approval              of  the Minister of Transport under the Railway Regulation              Act,  1840 (3 &amp; 4 Viet.,  c. 97), for regulating  the travelling              upon and  using  and working  of  and  for maintaining order              in  and upon  the  Company&apos;s railways. 80 e.g.,  (i) Under  sub-section (1)  of Section 32 of the Housing Act,  1925              (15  Geo. 5, c. 14), every  charge created by a charging order              under Part I of that  Act must be in  such form as the              Minister  of Health may prescribe.        (ii) Under sub-section (3) of  Section 60 of that Act the Minister of              Health may approve  a scheme submitted to him by a Local              Authority for  the exercise of their powers under Part III of              the Act.        (iii) Under sub-section  (1) of Section 172 of  the  Income  Tax Act,              1918 (S  &amp;  9  Geo. 5, c. 40),  the Commissioners  of Inland              Revenue may appoint a  day  on or before  which a collector              shall pay  over, or account for,  the tax  and  moneys given              him  in charge to collect.        (iv) Under Rule 10  of  Schedule E of that Act, the  Treasury may              fix such sum  as in their  opinion represents a fair equivalent              of  the average annual amount laid out  and expended in the              performance of their duties by any class of persons in receipt              of  any salary, fees or emoluments payable  out of  the public              revenue;  and  the sum so fixed is deducted for  tax.
Nomencla-    Although Parliament has  thus used  a  bewildering miscellanyturc: sug-  0f names for the same political function, we have thought it con-gcstions for venjent;  in  this Keport to use  the  one word  &quot;regulations&quot; to*tion        describe the subordinate legislation which results from delegation,           whatever form  it may take, or however many names it may in           fact have received  hitherto.   It  would obviously be desirable that           Parliament also should for the future endeavour to call the same           thing by the same  name.  Our Constitution is, under the influence           of modern views of the functions of the State, becoming inevitably           more complex, and new constitutional ideas are all the time being           evolved.  For that  vei-y reason careful choice of words is important.             But the confusion  of names is  not  only due  to the use of many           different words  for the same thing.   It is aggravated  by the use           of the same word for different things.   The word &quot; order &quot; is used           for an  executive act, for  a  judicial act, and for a legislative  act,           and in the last  use means the same  as a regulation or law.   But           the  word is also used for prerogative legislation  in  those special           spheres where that prerogative survives, in the form of &quot; Orders in           Council.&quot;   It is used too in the phrase &quot; provisional order,&quot; which           until confirmed  by Act of Parliament is not  an &quot; order &quot; at all.           Further confusion  is caused by  the use  of  the  term  &quot; special           orders &quot; in several differing senses  as explained in paragraph  6           at  page  27 below;  and  the draftsman&apos;s  art achieves its final           success in the phrase &quot; provisional special order.&quot;             The  commonest  words in statutory use to  describe delegated           legislation are  &quot; regulations,&quot; &quot; rules,&quot; and &quot; order.&quot;   But con-           siderable confusion is  caused by  their  indiscriminate use.   No           attempt seems to have been  made at any definition and delimita-           tion of  the words.  The  word  &quot; regulations &quot;  naturally  implies           legislative matter  of general application;  the  word  &apos;&apos; rules &apos;&apos;  is           apposite to procedure; and the word &apos;&apos; order &apos;&apos;  is more appropriate           to either an executive or  a judicial or semi-judicial decision.   But           these distinctions of meaning are ignored and no statutory definition           has been substituted.  Under many Acts, e.g., the Poor Law Acts           and Housing Acts, the Minister  of  Health makes &quot; orders &quot; of           a  general character  (e.g.,  the  Public  Assistance Order,  1930,51           which superseded the General Poor Law Order of 1847) which are           truly in the nature of &quot; regulations  &quot;  whilst many  &quot; rules &quot; are           not  confined to  matters of procedure.             No  doubt the use of  the phrase  &quot; Orders in Council     has           become  sanctioned by long tradition and  presents  a difficulty in           the way of an exclusive use of another word to describe  delegated           legislation.  But we call  attention to the point here for the sake            51 S.R. &amp; O., 1930, No. 185, p.  1405.            &quot; For the difference between prerogative  and statutory Orders iu Council,                see para. 5  below.  Wre refer here,  of course, to statutory Orders in                Council only.
14of emphasising the difficulty of the subject due  to confusion oflanguage;  we revert to the question in  our recommendations.   But further confusion is sometimes caused  by difficulties inherent j^&quot;.&quot;^ regu&apos;in the  subject matter.  Whilst any Ministerial activity which is ^gfJiative.legislative  in substance is necessarily within the phrase &quot; delegated legislation,&quot; that  expression  is not in a practical sense appropriate to all the  regulations,  rules and  orders  which  are issued by  a minister,  nor  even to all  those which are  so made pursuant toexpress authority  in  some  Act of Parliament.  Many regulations,rules and  orders,  even some which are legislative in form, are intruth mere machinery of administration, or the exercise of a purelyexecutive function, amounting to little  more than  a statement of practice, which the Minister publishes for the guidance of his ownofficers,  or. for the convenience of the  public, in connection  withsome Act  of Parliament  for the  administration of which  he is responsible.  Such action  often  might  equally well be  expressedin a circular letter to those concerned.  It is indeed difficult in theory and impossible in practice to draw Difficulty ofa precise dividing line  between the legislative on  the  one hand rt&apos;^lldt-dzs&apos;and the purely  administrative on the other; administrative action so often partakes of both legislative and executive characteristics.  the true  nature of  statutory provisions and of regulations made there-under is not infrequently still further complicated by the addition ofa quasi-judicial aspect; regulations in  which this  aspect  appearswill  be  dealt with in Section III as well as  in this  Section of our report.  This  complication  is not  peculiar to the British Constitutionbut inherent in modern democracy.  It has  been  much considered in the United States.&quot;  But just because legislative and administrative functions overlap,it  is  dangerous to allow oneself to be guided too much by  thename.  No doubt  a large  proportion of the regulations made by ministers under statutory  authority are intimately concerned withadministration, and often  constitute, wholly or mainly, codes ofmere executive orders.  And yet  to take any set  of regulations and  conclude that, because they are primarily  &quot; administrative,&quot;they can be  disregarded as having  no legislative aspect may often be wrong.   Indeed to exclude &quot; administrative &quot;  regulations fromany  system  of  safeguards  to be a-adopted in regard to  delegated legislation  would be dangerous; for to do  so might  let in the veryevils against which safeguards are designed.   Executive discretion,uncontrolled by safeguards, may easily become a cloak for thosevery powers of arbitrary legislation or  judicial  decision  feared by those critics who describe our Civil  Service as &quot; the Bureaucracy &quot;and  think of it as &quot; the new despotism.&quot;53 See for example  The  Insurance Commissioner in the  United States by      Professor Patterson (Harvard University Press, 1927), p. 5.

The essentially subordinate character of delegated legislation.  3.  The power to legislate,  when delegated by Parliament, differs from Parliaments own power to legislate.  Parliament is  supremeand  its power to legislate is therefore  unlimited.   It  can do thegreatest  things; it can do the smallest.  It can make general lawsfor a vast Empire; it can make a particular exception out of themin favour of  a particular individual.81  It can provide and hasin fact provided for the payment of old  age pensions to all  whofulfil the  statutory conditions :62 it can also provide and has in fact &quot; 38 &amp; 39 Viet., c. 55, s.  299. &quot; 39 &amp; 40 Viet., c. 77, s.  8. 56 38 &amp; 39 Viet., c. 80, s.  1. &quot; 21 Geo. 3, c. 49. 58 1  Edw. 7, c. 22, s. 119. &quot; 1  &amp; 2  Geo. 5, c. 50, s. 16. &quot; 34 &amp; 35 Viet., c. 78, s.  7. 81 e.g., An Act (passed in  1887) to enable His Royal  Highness  the Duke      of Connaught to return to England for a limited time for the pur-      pose of being present at the celebration of Her  Majesty&apos;s  Jubilee      without thereby  resigning his command  in Bombay (50 &amp; 51 Viet..      c. 10). &quot; S  Edw. 7, c. 40.

It is  a principle of our  Constitution  that  whatever  laws  arepassed by Parliament are binding, as the law of the land,  on every-body.  But it is also  a principle of our Constitution that no onemay be  deprived of his liberty or of his rights except in due courseof law i.e., unless he has done  something which  the  law  saysspecifically shall have that effect.  In  the absence of a common lawor a statutory authority,  &quot; A &quot; cannot be deprived of rights by an executive act of a Minister; and if the Minister claims to have madea regulation  entitling him to interfere  with &quot; A&apos;s  &quot; rights,  theCourts will interfere  to stop  the Minister unless  he can  show by what authority, statutory or otherwise, he has made  the regulationin question.  It follows,- therefore, that to safeguard the second of the twoprinciples just  mentioned  the precise  limits  of  the  law-makingpower, which Parliament intends to  confer on a  Minister,  should always be defined in clear language by the statute  which confers it.                      Growth of delegation.  4. Before the middle of the nineteenth century the main func-tions of government in England were those of defence and  police.The State Departments  were few  in number, and the  manage-ment  of the  life of the people was not regarded  as  a function ofgovernment.   In these circumstances Parliament  was well able topass all the necessary legislation itself, and  there was no need to resort to any extensive delegation of  legislative power.  We have,however, already pointed out in  the first paragraph of this Sectionthat legislative  powers were delegated on a modest  scale even inthe seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries.&quot;  Mr.  Carr in &quot; Dele-  Early nine-gated Legislation &quot;&quot; has made the following analysis of the statutes  teenthof 1819  and 1820-two years taken at random-from the point of  century.view of  delegation :       &quot; The British Herring Fisheries Commissioners could make    regulations  about payment  of  bounty,  shipment of  salt and    exportation of fish,06 such  mattei-s as the Ministry of Agri- &quot; 22 Hen. 8, c. 9: &quot;It  is ordained and enacted by  authority  of this     present Parliament that  the  said Richard Rose  shall be therefore     boiled to death without having any advantage of his clergy.&quot; &quot; V7e also pointed out that as early as  1531 the Statute  of Sewers con-     ferred on  Commissioners of  Sewers  full  power  and  authority  to     make laws,  ordinances and  decrees, and to amend and repeal such     laws, and  to make new laws  as the cases  necessary should  require     in  that behalf.

     culture  and  Fisheries  would deal with to-day.  The Com-     missioners  of Irish Fisheries  could  also  make  regulations&quot;     though the regulations they could make are trifling compared     with the detailed regulations already contained  in  the Act.     The  Irish Court of Exchequer could  vary  its table of  fees by     order of Court.08    The Lord  Lieutenant could reduce the     statutory rate of interest on public works  loans  in Ireland.&quot;     There is a hint that the Treasury can  make rules as to the     drawing of lotteries.&apos;0   Otherwise  there is not  much  delega-     tion  in  those two years.&quot;    Perhaps the  only example of a     statutory Order in Council  is in the Act  authorising  justices     to seize arms in certain disturbed counties; there is power  to&apos;     make proclamations extending  the Act ito other counties  or     withdrawing  its  operation   in  the counties  prescribed.71  At     this stage, the practice of delegating legislative power is already     understood,  but Parliament is still able  to  do by itself almost     all the legislating that the country  requires.&quot;   We  have already quoted in  Section I the  passage from theReport of Lord  Macmillan&apos;s  Committee, in which  they draw atten-tion to the profound change in the conception of the function  ofgovernment  which has  since occurred, and to its  effect  on theStatute Book.   We do  not, however, think that they are quiteaccurate in suggesting as they  appear to  suggest that the change is of recent origin.   It  dates from  the middle of the nineteenth century and  was exhaustively  analysed  by Professor Dicey  in&quot; Law and Opinion in England  &quot;&quot; in two lectures&apos;4 entitled &quot; TheGrowth of Collectivism &quot;  and  &quot; Period of Collectivism &quot;.  Evenin  1905 that distinguished  constitutional  lawyer regarded collec-tivism  as predominant  in English legislation&quot;  and expressed theopinion that  its  force was neither spent  nor on  the decline, butthat  the logic  of events  was  leading to the  extension  and thedevelopment  of  legislation  &quot; which bears the impress of collec-tivism  &quot;.&quot;   He  found  the true explanation  in conditions not wholly democratic or even political.&quot; &apos;7 1 Geo. 4, o. 82,  s. 21. &quot; 1 Geo.  4, c. 68,  s.  2. &quot; 1 Geo. 4, c 81,  s. 4. &quot; 1 Geo.  4, c. 72,  s. 3. 71 See 1 Geo. 4, o. 39, ss. 9, 39. 72 60 Geo. 3, c. 2,  ss. 8, 9. 73 Lectures on the  Relation  between Law and  Public Opinion in  England,      by A.

143   There can, we think, be no doubt that the practice of delegating  Practicallegislative powers to the Ministers of the Crown on the large and  reasons forgenerous modern scale is the indirect  consequence  of  this sort  delegation.of legislation.  Parliament nowadays  passes  so  many laws  every year, that it lacks the time to shape all  the legislative details.  &quot; Noone  who looks at a collection of  the  annual output  of delegated legislation can seriously propose that Parliament should new cancel the  concession of legislative  power  and  should undertake  for thefuture under its own direct  authority all  the legislative activities which at  present are  left to His  Majesty in Council or to thevarious public Departments &quot;&quot;  Much of the  detail is so technicalas to  be  unsuitable for  Parliamentary discussion for  example,&quot; patents, copyright, trade marks, designs, diseases,  poisons, the pattern of miners&apos; safety lamps, wireless  telegraphy, the  heatingand  lighting  values of gas,  legal  procedure,  or  the intricacies offinance &quot;.7*  Many of the laws affect people&apos;s lives so closely thatelasticity is  essential.  It is  impossible to pass an Act of Parlia-ment to control an epidemic of measles or an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease as and  when  it occurs, and such  measures as thePublic Health Acts must be  differently  applied  in different  partsof the country.  Free sale of poisons is now recognised to be con-trary to  the best interests  of society : &quot; Why should  Parlia-mentary time be  occupied with the passing of a new  Act merely because the doctors have come to the conclusion that ecgonine and          &apos;heroin ought to be  added&apos; to the statutory schedule? &quot;&quot;  These are the practical considerations which have induced Par-liament  to resort to the  practice  of wholesale and almost indis-criminate  delegation.   &quot; England &quot;, said Lord  Beaconsfield,&quot; isnot  governed  by  logic;  she  is governed  by  Parliament.&quot;   Thepractice  of delegation has been adopted  from time to  time underpressure of circumstance, and Parliament has steadily pursued acourse without fully  realising its attendant risks.  The truth  is that if Parliament  were not willing to delegatelaw-making power, Parliament would  be unable to pass the kind and  quantity of legislation which modern public opinion requires.  In 1916 the American lawyer and statesman, Mr. Elihu Boot, inhis presidential address  to the American Bar Association,  aftersummarising the agencies at  work in the public life of the UnitedStates in the twentieth century, said :       &quot; Before these agencies, the old  doctrine  prohibiting the    delegation of legislative  powers  has  virtually  retired  from the     field and  given up the fight.  There will be no withdi-withdrawal from    these experiments.   We  shall go  on; we shall expand them, &apos;&quot; &quot; Delegated Legislation,&quot; p. 20. &quot; Ibid.,  pp. 20-21. *&quot; Ibid.,  p. 9.
               whether we approve theoretically or not, because such agencies               furnish protection to right, and obstacles to wrong-doing, which               under our new social and industrial conditions cannot be prac-               tically accomplished by the old and simple procedure of  legisla-               tures  and courts as in the last generation.&quot;&quot;             In our opinion these words are as  applicable to the United King-           dom to-day as they were to the United States in 1916.             While,  however, we find the true  explanation  of  the  practice           of delegation in the legislative tendencies of modern England, and           in the conditions produced  by. those tendencies, we are indebted           to Sir William Graham-Harrison for the information that the  prac-           tice  has been  deliberately  encouraged by Lord  Thring and his           successors in the office of  Parliamentary Counsel.   As Sir William           shows in his  memorandum printed in the second of the companion           volumes to our Report, Lord Thring was a strong believer in the           principle of leaving details to be settled departmentally and  with-           drawing procedure and subordinate matters from the cognisance  of           Parliament: and Sir William tells us that Lord  Thring&apos;s successors           have consciously and whole-heartedly followed the  principle.             No one familiar with  the  conditions  under which business  is           transacted in Parliament will doubt that legislative methods and           forms must of necessity be  largely dependent on the suggestion  of           those skilled  advisers, whether Departmental chiefs  or  Parlia-           mentary  Counsel, on  whose  experienced guidance the Ministers           of the Crown must inevitably rely.Possibilities   We doubt  however, whether  Parliament itself has fully  realisedof abuse.    how extensive the practice of delegation has become, or the extent           to which  it has surrendered its own  functions in the process,  or           how easily the practice might  be  abused.                      Orders in  Council,  and  Provisional Orders.             5. Before  we describe the different  forms  assumed to-day  by           delegated legislation, it will be  convenient to clear the ground  by           distinguishing  two forms of original  legislation  which resemble           delegated legislation in name  but  not  in substance,  viz.,  some           &quot; Orders  in  Council,&quot; and &quot; provisional orders.&quot;   Orders  in           Council are  of two kinds,  which from  the point of view of our           enquiry differ  fundamentally  in constitutional principle :                  (i) those made in virtue of the Royal Prerogative, and                (ii) those  which are authorized by statute.Prerogative    (i) The Royal Prerogative  may  be regarded for our purpose asOrders in   what is left of the original sovereign power of the Crown to legislateCouncil.    without the  authority of the  Houses  of Parliament.  Thus the           Crown  can legislate  by Order  in Council for  a  newly conquered             11  41 Amer. Bar. Assoc., 456,  369.
144country and can regulate trade and commerce  in  time  of  war.The best known modern prerogative  Order in  Council is the Orderdated the 16th of February, 1917,  establishing a rigid blockade of enemy  territory commonly called  the  Second  Reprisals  Order.The essence of this kind of legislation by  the King in Council with-  -out the intervention of Parliament is that  it is original and in  no sense delegated.  The fact and in modern constitutional  practice it  is a fact that the King  in  such  legislation is advised by his cabinet does not modify this view.   (ii)  Statutory Orders in Council are made  in  virtue of, and in Statutoryaccordance with powers expressly delegated by Act of Parliament. Orders inThey are a much larger and constantly  growing class.  Prerogative Counct&apos;-Orders in Council, not being delegated legislation  at all, are whollyoutside  our reference.  Statutory Orders in Council,  on the otherhand,  are  in  all aspects delegated  legislation.   They  are instru-ments  of greater dignity than Departmental orders, regulations,rules and so forth,  but in  principle and for  our purposes do not differ from them.  Similarly a  provisional order is not delegated  legislation.   It is Provisionalin practice drafted by a Department or  some independent body like Orders.a statutory company and receives its final form before submission to Parliament,  but it requires confirmation by an Act of Parliamentto give it the force of law.  Its nature is well explained  in the following passage8&quot; :        &quot; The principles upon which  the  provisional order  is based     were set out by Sir G.  Jessel, M.R., in In re  Morley (L.R.     20  Eq. 17)  when dealing  with costs in connection with  a     provisional order made by the Board  of Trade under the Tram-     ways Act, 1S70.  &apos; The Legislature  &apos; according to this autho-     rity,  &apos; instead  of allowing proceedings to be taken before a     Committee of either House, decided  that these inquiries might     be  prosecuted  more cheaply  and  more  beneficially  before a     local tribunal, or persons appointed to inquire into the matters     locally.  These proceedings are instituted,  and  the  parties,     instead of applying to Parliament, apply  to  the Board of     Trade; and after making a proper investigation in the locality,     the  Board of Trade makes a  provisional order, and  then,  if     Parliament sees fit, that  provisional order,  generally with a     great many more, is confirmed by an Act of Parliament, which     is  not procured at all by  the applicants, but  by the Board     of  Trade that  is,  by the Executive  Government  of the     country.   The result is  that there has been  an entire change     of system, and all  that the applicant obtains is the provisional     order, and there is no proceeding in  Parliament with which &quot; Taken from  an Article by Mr.  Arthur Scott Quekett (now Sir Arthur,     Parliamentary Counsel to the Government of Northern Ireland), in     the Law Quarterly Review for October,  1918, Vol. 34, p. 357.
StatutoryOrders inCouncil.Varieties ojDepart-mentalHegulations    he really  has anything  to  do directly.&apos;    If,  however, any    opposition is raised, a Bill to confirm a provisional order can    usually be referred  to  a Select  Committee,  and  the  parties    must then appear to promote and oppose, as in the case  of    an ordinary  private Bill.    Although the  confh-ming  Bill  is    brought in by the  Government in the first instance, if such    opposition is raised, the conduct of the proceedings in Com-    mittee may be left to the promoters.&quot;                 Forms of delegated legislation.  6.  Delegated legislation by Ministers of the Crown invariablytakes one of two  forms :             (a) the statutory Order in Council;            (b)  the Departmental regulation.     (a)  Statutory Orders in Council occupy  the  place of  honour           in delegated legislation.               &quot; Until  our administrative Departments (which in            some instances are  offshoots of  the Privy Council)            reached their present elaboration,&quot; says  Mr. Carr in            &quot; Delegated Legislation,&quot;&quot;  &quot; the King in Council            or the Privy Council was the obvious authority avail-            able to  undertake to make rules and regulations.  The            more elaborate our  Departments  become, the more            do they take over the legislative powers  entrusted in            time past by Parliament to  the Privy Council.  Yet,            even now,  though  the Home Office is specially con-            cerned  with aliens  and the Air  Council with aerial            navigation, the big codes governing those topics are            issued  not  on  the  authority of  the heads of those            Departments but on the authority  of an  Order in            Council.   Doubtless the  Department  prepares  the            drafts,  but the formal  legislative act  is  made more            dignified one might almost say  more  national by            being united  with  the  traditions  of the King  in            Council.&quot;     (b)  The   expression  &quot; Departmental   regulations &quot;  is   an           accurate  and comprehensive description of all Minis-           terial delegated legislation other than Orders in Council.           As we have already observed,  Departmental regulations           appear under various names.   They are sometimes called           regulations, sometimes rules, and sometimes orders.   A           regulation under  Section 82  of  the  Post  Office Act,           1908,81 may  be made by Treasury &quot; warrant &quot; ; and           under Section 13  of the Regimental Debts  Act, 1893,85 &quot; p. 55. &quot; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48. &quot; 56 A 57 Viet., c. 5.
His Majesty Himself may by  &quot; warrant&quot;  under the Royal SignManual make regulations for the execution of the Act.  Where  theMinister of Health confirms a bye-law made by a District Council&quot;or a town planning  scheme  proposed by  a  Local Authority he isexercising what  is constitutionally  a legislative function,  though he may,  in order  to place himself in a  position to consider  thematter, follow a judicial process and may  address  himself to  his task in a judicial&quot;spirit.  Indeed when he appoints  a day or gives a certificate, he may be doing an act with legislative efficacy.  Butconfusing as these various expressions are, they are merely differentnames for the same thing a piece of delegated legislation issued on the authority of a Minister, as distinct from the Privy  Councilitself.   Nor is it possible to discover in  the existing practice  anyrational plan for calling one piece of legislation  a warrant,  anotheran order, and another something else.  The  most scientific explorercannot make  a map  of a jungle.  As we  pointed  out  in  paragraph  2  on  page  18,  the term Spe(&quot; special  orders &quot; is used with  bewildering  variety.   For example, OrdSections 80 and 81 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901&quot; (which apply to the making of regulations under that Act), as set out  andadapted in the Schedule to the Gas Regulation Act, 1920,88 are madeto apply  to the  making of special orders under the Gas Act;  butthey do  not apply to special orders under  the  Factory Act itself,which appear to have no feature  which distinguishes them fromorders in general except a grander name.  It is true,  as  Sir  William  Graham Harrison pointed out in his evidence  (Memorandum  paragraph  4 (v)),  that the term has  alsobeen used by  Parliament to describe certain orders (made  or con-firmed by Ministers) which were intended to take the place of pro-visional orders confirmed by Act of Parliament.  See for instanceSection 26 of  the Electricity  (Supply)  Act,  1919.&quot;  But the inten-&quot; e.g., under  Section 184 of the Public Health  Act, 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Viet.,    c. 55).&quot; 1 Edw. 7, 0. 22.&quot; 10 &amp; 11  Geo. 5, c. 28 (see s. 10).89 9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c.  100. The Section is as follows:          &quot; Anything which  under  the Electric Lighting Acts  may  be      effected by  a provisional order confirmed  by  Parliament may be      effected by a special order  made by the  Electricity Commissioners      and  confirmed by the Board  of Trade  under  and in accordance      with the provisions  of this Act, or by an order establishing a      joint electricity authority under this Act,  and references in those      Acts and the Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act, 1899, to provisional      orders  shall  be construed  as including  references to  such  special      orders and orders as aforesaid, except that the paragraphs numbered      (1)  to (4) of  Section  four of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, shall      not apply to  such special orders and orders as aforesaid,  and any
            tion  did not  lead  to any real distinction  between  ordinary  and              special &quot; orders of a Minister.  In Section 20 the Parliamentary            Bill  followed  by the  Royal  Assent  is replaced by an  affirmative            resolution of each House ;  and it might be thought  at first sight that            this  is the distinguishing  feature of a special order; but other  sec-            tions of the Act  (e.g. Section 15) allow other things to  be done by            special order; and Section 35 defines the procedure for  a  &quot; special &quot;            order as laying before Parliament, not with the requirement of an            affirmative resolution as  under Section  26 but only  subject to a            proviso  for annulment  on a  hostile  resolution the  ordinary pro-            cedure  adopted  by  Parliament for Ministerial orders  in  general            which do not  boast  the proud title of &quot; special.&quot;              Moreover special  orders vary  greatly  in their  intrinsic nature.            At one end of the scale they  may  be plainly legislative and  at the            other end scarcely  more than  administrative.   For  instance a            special order  under the Trade Boards Act, 1918,00  withdrawing a            trade from the  operation of  the Trade Boards  Act,  1909,&quot; or a            special order under  the Gas Regulation  Act,  1920,88  authorising a            Local Authority  to  supply gas outside  their own district is  plainly            legislative ; whereas  a special order under the Factory Act8&apos; directing            thermometers to  be  provided in a class of factories&apos;&quot;&apos; or determining            what is sufficient   and suitable accommodation&quot; in  the  way  of            sanitary conveniences, is  scarcely more than administrative.              There is a still further  use  of the term &quot; special orders &quot;  in  the            recent Standing  Order  of the House of Lords  to describe  certain            rules, regulations or other documents which require an affirmative            resolution of that House.91              It  is clear that special orders cannot usefully be regarded  for our            purposes as a separate and well defined class of delegated legislation.

146classification leads  to some useful differentiation of procedure thereis  not much to be gained by it.  Parliament itself has made orauthorised the  making of several different classifications :    No. 1. The first divides them broadly into     (a) those  required  by the  enabling statute  to be  laid before           Parliament,  and     (6) those not so required.  No. 2. Section  1 of  the Rules Publication Act, 1893,&quot;  makes asubdivision of  class No. 1 (a) by requiring a certain procedure of preliminary  notice  for  some  of the regulations etc.  contained inthis class but  not for all.  No. 3.. A different classification results from Section 3 of  thatAct,  and  the Treasury  Regulations made thereunder, which divideregulations etc. into &apos;     (a) those  required to be sent to the King&apos;s Printer;     (b) those  not so required.  No. 4. Class (a) of classification No. 3 is defined by the TreasuryRegulations as including &quot; every exercise of a statutory power  by a rule-making authority which is  of a legislative and not an executivecharacter&quot;; but  as  excluding  an  exercise  which  is  &quot; confirmedonly  &quot; by a rule-making authority.  This  classification  purports tomake a  division   of  principle  between legislative  and executiveregulations; but in so farms any given set of regulations which are mainly executive  may  contain  some  which  are  legislative, and inso far as  the confirmation by a Minister gives legislative  efficacy,the classification in practice departs from its own principle.38   No. 5. Those  regulations  which are sent to the King&apos;s Printerare sub-divided into :      (a) those  which are printed;     (b) those  which are not.  The practice is to print&quot;  nearly  every legulation  sent to theKing&apos;s Pz*inter which is public and not local in character, so  thatthe sub-division into those which are  printed and those which arenot is almost identical with the sub-division into     (a) Public and General;     (b) Local.  The distinction  between public and local regulations follows inthe main  that  between  public and local Acts of Parliament. 95 Paragraph. 9 (ou page  44) below gives  a fuller explanation  of  Section 1      of the Pules Publication Act, 1893 (56 &amp; 57 Viet., c. 66), and  para-      graph 15 contains our recommendations for removing its  anomalies. &quot; The Rules Publication  Act, 1893 (56 &amp; 57 Viet.,  c. 66), the Treasury      Regulations made thereunder in 1894, and  the  Treasury Circular of      the  25th  November, 1921, are printed as  Annex I to  this Eeport      (see  p. 119). 97 See para. 9, page 47,  for fuller description of the arrangements for       printing.LayingbeforeParliament.Section 1 ofllulesPublicationAct.Section S ofliulesPublicationAct.Legislativeandexecutiveregulations.General andlocalregulations.
08 20 &amp; 21  Geo. 5, e. 43.             The classifications of the Rules Publication Act, 1893, are thus of           little use for our purposes; they throw small light on the problems           of principle which  we have  to  consider.  For  similar reasons we           cannot regard  the  published volumes of &quot; Statutory Rules and           Orders &quot; as defining our field.                 Normal and  exceptional types of delegated legislation.             8. We have  already observed that the system of delegated legis-           lation has been built up haphazard without plan or logic, and that           the extent and limits of delegation have been determined by acci-           dent  and  expediency and  not upon any system.  It is difficult to           find and it may be misleading to look for any  clear and conscious           purpose in  the historical  development  of the  process.  But it is           possible to distinguish between two types of delegated legislation,           and to say that one  of them represents the normal and the other           the exceptional practice of Parliament.The normal    The normal  type of delegated legislation has two distinguishingtype (A),    characteristics : one positive and the other negative.             The positive characteristic is that the limits of the delegated           power are defined  so clearly by  the enabling  Act as to be made           plainly known to Parliament, to the Executive and to the Public,           and to be readily enforceable by the Judiciary.              The negative characteristic is that powers delegated do not in-           clude power to do  certain things, namely                    (i) to legislate on matters of principle or to impose taxation;                  (ii) to amend Acts of Parliament, either the Act by which                the powers are delegated, or other  Acts.              A good example of the  normal type of delegated legislation is to            be found in the  Road Traffic Act,  1930.33   Section 10 and the            First. Schedule  of that  Act  prescribe the rate of  speed to be            observed by the various classes and descriptions of motor vehicles            on roads in Great  Britain generally;  but Section 46 confers on the            Minister of Transport, on  the application of  a  Local Authority,            wide powers of further restricting or even prohibiting the  driving            of motor as well as other vehicles or of any specified class or            description of vehicles on any  specified  road within the area of the            Local  Authority making the application.  No one who  has ever            been in a motor car would desire Parliament to undertake this task            itself,  and the staunchest upholder of  the British Constitution is            unlikely to maintain that it is seriously threatened  by  delegation            of such a (type.
147  There are, however,  to  be  found on the Statute&apos;Bcok certain The&apos;.exceptional instances of delegated legislative powers, which may be exceptionalconveniently classified as follows :                                type      (i) Instances of powers  to legislate on  matters of principle,           and even to impose taxation;     (ii) Instances of powers to amend Acts of Parliament, either           the Act by which  the  powers are delegated,  or  other           Acts;     (iii) Instances of powers conferring so wide a discretion on a           Minister, that it is almost impossible to know what limit           Parliament did intend to impose;     (iv) Instances where Parliament, without formally abandoning           its normal practice  of limiting delegated powers, has in           effect done so by forbidding control by the Counts.Before we  deal separately with each of these four classes of excep-tional delegation we desire  to point out that they have one featurein common.  When Parliament has resorted to any of them, it hasgenerally  been on account of the special  nature of  the subject matter and without the intention of establishing  a precedent.  A remarkable instance of power to legislate on matters of prin- (;) instancesciple is now to be found in! sub-section 1 of Section 136 of  the of powers toPoor Law  Act, 1930,33  which begins :                              legislate on                                                                  matters of         For executing the powers given to him  by this Act    the principle     Minister (of Health) shall make such rules, orders and regula-     tions as he may think fit for            (a) the  management of the poor   .   .  .  .&quot;This power was conferred  by  Parliament on  the Poor Law Com-missioners  in 1834,101 has been on the Statute  Book ever since, andhas  been vested in the  Minister of Health since the creation of his office in 1919,0\  In 1834  the administration of the  poor law, which down to  thattime had been carried on partly by parochial officers, partly by  the justices of  the peace, had for a long  time past become very unwiseand  extravagant  and  a thorough reform was necessary.

When Parliament has resorted to any of them, it has generally  been  on account  of the special nature  of  the subject matter and without  the intention of establishing a precedent.   A remarkable  instance of power to legislate on  matters of prin- ciple  is now to  be  found in sub-section  1 of Section 136  of the Poor  Law Act, 1930,09  which begins :       &quot; For executing the powers given to him by this  Act100 the    Minister (of Health) shall make such rules, orders and regula-    tions as he  may think  fit for            (a) the management of the poor  .  .  .  .&quot; This  power was conferred by Parliament  on the Poor Law  Com- missioners in 1834,&quot;&quot; has been on the Statute Book ever since, and has been  vested in the  Minister of Health  since the creation of his office in 1919,oa.  In  1834 the administration of the poor law, which down to that time had  been carried on partly by parochial officers, partly by the justices of the peace, had for a long time past become very unwise and extravagant and a thorough  reform  was necessary.

of Poor Law Commissioners with a  large control over the wholepoor law system and wide powers of legislation.  It was expectedthat the commission would only be  necessary  for  a  time,  but itwas renewed again and  again103  and developed first  in 1847  intothe Poor Law Board,10&apos; then in  1871 into the  Local GovernmentBoard103 and finally in 1919 into the Ministry of Health.103  Pew  Acts of Parliament contain  so wide a  regulation-makingpower  as this  power which Parliament conferred in  1834  on  thoPoor Law Commissioners  and  eventually by succession  upon  theMinister of Health.  A notable  example of the delegation of a  power to impose taxa-tion was contained in  Part II of the  Safeguarding of industries act, 1921100.  That part  of that  Act  was aimed at  the preventionof dumping.   Section 2 empowered the Board of  Trade (afterreference to  a committee  sitting in  public  except when hearingevidence  on  confidential matters) to  make  orders applying  that part of that Act to goods  of any class or description  (other thanarticles  of food or  drink),  manufactured  in  any.specified country or counti&quot;ies outside the United Kingdom, if certain statutory con-ditions  precedent were fulfilled;  and  Section 3 provided that  any goods in respect of which an order had been made should  on  im-portation into the  United Kingdom be  liable to duties of customsequal to one-third  of their value in addition to any  other duties of customs chargeable thereon.  Rigorous  safeguards  for control bythe House of Commons were provided by sub-section 4 of Section -2of the Act, which provided that when the House of Commons wassitting,  or being adjourned or prorogued would sit within a  month,no order should be  made  unless the draft of it were  approved, with or without modification, by  a resolution of  the House  and  thatin other cases, while the order  might be made forthwith, it  shouldnot continue  in force for  longer than  one month  after the next meeting of the House without a resolution of that House authorising-ing its continuance with or without modification.  Two  orders were made under  Section 2,  both of them in 1922.The draft of one107 was laid before  the House of Commons  and approved : the other10&apos; was made during the Recess and was  con-tinued in force when the House met.  The whole of Part II of theAct was repealed by the Finance  Act, 1930.103103  2 &amp;  3 Viet., c. 83; 3 &amp; 4 Viet., c. 42; 5 Viet., c. 10; 5 &amp; 6 Viet., c. 57.104 10 &amp; 11 Viet., c. 109.

148  During  the conditions of  emergency which have obtained since RecentAugust last, Parliament has not hesitated in several  far-reaching emergency and important statutes to delegate on matters of principle, all in a examples tbrief period of  Parliamentary time;  though in each  case a  time 1^ceeptw&quot;a limit has been imposed on the use of the emergency powers.  The  &quot;following five Acts were passed in the Autumn of 1931 :       (1)  The  Gold Standard  (Amendment)  Act,  1931,&quot;0  (Royal    Assent  21st  September,  1931)  empowered  the   Treasury    (Section  1  (3) ) to make and from  time to time vary orders    authorising  the taking  of such  measures in relation  to the    Exchanges and otherwise as they may consider expedient for    meeting difficulties arising in connection with the suspension of    the Gold Standard.  The sub-section is in force for six months    from  the passing of  the Act.      (2)  The National Economy Act, 1931,1,1 (Royal Assent 30th    September,  1931) empowered His Majesty during the period of    one month after the commencement  of the Act to make Orders    in Council  effecting economies in  respect  of the  services    specified  in the Schedule  to the Act, and in respect of the    remuneration (otherwise than by way of pension assessed before    the commencement  of  the  Act)  of  persons in  His  Majesty&apos;s    service.  Sub-section 2 of Section 1 provided that  the Minister    designated in any such Order might make regulations for giving    effect to the Order, and sub-section  3 provided that any Order    or regulations  should,  as  from  a  date not earlier  than 1st    October,  1931, have effect notwithstanding anything in  any    enactment.      (3)  The Foodstuffs (Prevention of Exploitation) Act 193V1&apos;    (Royal Assent 7th  October, 1931), authorised the  Board of    Trade, in case of need, to take exceptional measures for pre-    venting or remedying shortages in, or unreasonable increases in    the prices of, certain articles of food and drink.  Section 2, sub-    section 3, provided  that the Act should cease to take effect on    the expiration of six months from the passing thereof.  Section    1, sub-section 3,  provided  that any  regulations should be laid    before each  House of Parliament as  soon as may be after they      are made, and that if an address is presented by either House    within the  next subsequent 20 days on which that House has    sat praying that  the regulation may be  annulled,  it  shall    thenceforth  be void  but  without prejudice to the validity of any-    thing done thereunder or to the making of any new regulation.      (4)  The Abnormal Importations (Customs Duties) Act 1931lls    (Royral Assent  20th November, 1931), empowered the Board    of Trade, with the concurrence of the Treasury, with a view to110 21 &amp; 22 Geo. o, c. 46.111 21 &amp; 22 Geo. 5, o. 48.113 21 &amp; 22 Geo. 5, c. 51.113 22 Geo.  5, c. 1.13307
    preventing the  importation  into  the  United  Kingdom  in    abnormal quantities of articles wholly or mainly manufactured,    by order to impose customs duties up to an amount not exceed-    ing 100 per cent, of value on any of the articles comprised in    Class III of the  &quot; Import and Export List,&quot;  subject to subse-    quent confirmation by affirmative resolution  of the  House of    Commons within  a  limited period.   The  Act is  in force for    six months and  no longer (Section 7, sub-section 3).       (5) The Horticultural Products (Emergency Customs Duties)    Act 1931&quot;* (Royal Assent, 11th December, 1931), empowered    the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, with the concurrence    of the Treasury, with a view to reducing the importation into    the United Kingdom of certain classes of fresh fruit  and fresh    vegetables and other horticultural products, the production of    which in  the  United Kingdom can  be increased, or which are    articles of luxury, by order to impose duties up to 100 per cent.    of value on any  of certain scheduled articles.  The  Act is to    continue  in force  for twelve months and  no  longer.  Orders    may have immediate effect but are to be laid before the House    of Commons so soon as may be after they are made, and require    subsequent approval of that House by affirmative resolution    within a  limited period (Section 1, sub-section 2).  A rule or    regulation contained in such orders is not to be deemed to be a    statutory  rule within the meaning  of Section 1 of the Rules    Publication Act,  1893.&apos;&quot;  These five very recent examples of delegated legislation on mattersof principle  or of taxation  were  all treated by Parliament  asoccasioned and justified by the emergency.  As the exceptional typeof delegation  characteristic of emergency  legislation no  less than any other falls within our terms of reference it is our duty to reportour views upon it.  We deal further with it in paragraph  11 below.But  we would point  out here, incidentally, that it is of  interest for our present purpose to note the great diversity of form observablein these  five statutes in  regard to  the procedure  and to the safe-guards provided in them for the delegated legislation  which  theyauthorise.  Our general view is, that even in the exceptional types of (power to pass delegated legislation it is desirable to standardiseboth procedure and safeguards as far as possible.   Nothing is moreapt to create legal  ambiguities of meaning than variation of languagewithout difference of intention.114 22 Geo. 5, c. 3.115 No similar exemption for  the Board  of  Trade will  be  found  in  the     Abnormal Importations (Customs Duties) Act,  1931, just mentioned,     for that Board is  already  entirely exempted from Section 1  of  the     Rules Publication Act by subsection (4) thereof.

Many goods are expresslyexempted by the Act itself, and the Treasury is empowered, after receiving a recommendation from the Import Duties Advisory Com-mittee, constituted under the Act,  and after consultation with  theappropriate Department, to  direct  by order that any  other  goods of whatsoever class or description shall also be exempted.   Duringthe first  six months after  the  passing of the Act this power mayonly be exercised in cases  of special urgency: but after the expira-tion of that period  this limitation on the power will cease.115&quot;  In the case of articles of luxury or  articles of a kind which  arebeing produced or are.likely within a reasonable time to be pro-dticed in  the United Kingdom in quantities which  are substantialin relation to  United Kingdom consumption, the Committee may,having due regard to the  advisability in  the  national interest of restricting  imports into the  United Kingdom  and the interestsgenerally of trade and industry  in the United Kingdom, recommendadditional duties at such rates as they may specify ; and the treasury may,  if  they  think  fit after  consultation  with the  appropriate department, by order  direct  that additional  duty  at a rate  notexceeding the  amount recommended shall be charged.1&apos;50  Neither  the  general ad  valorem duty nor any additional dutyis chargeable on the products or manufactures of the Crown Coloniesor territories under His Majesty&apos;s protection : and the like exemp-tion may be granted  by Order in Council to any mandated terri-tory.115d*  In the  case  of the products and manufactures of the Dominions,India and Southern Rhodesia,  neither  the general ad valorem dutynor any  additional duty is chargeable till the 15th of November,1932; and after that date both  exemptions and preferences maybe  granted for such  goods by orders made by  the  Treasury  onthe recommendation of the Secretary  of State.1,50  In the  case  of foreign  goods  exemptions and preferences may begranted by orders made by the Treasury on the recommendationof the Board of Trade,  and in the case  of foreign countries whichdiscriminate against British goods supplementary duties  may beusa 22 Geo. 5, c. 8.

If it imposes a customs duty, it  will cease           to have effect unless it is approved by resolution of the House within           28 Parliamentary days;  and if it does not impose a customs duty,           it may be annulled by  resolution of the House within  the same           period.&quot;3&quot;             The Import Duties  Advisory  Committee may authorise the dele-           gation of any of their functions to a sub-Committee consisting of           members of the Committee.&quot;31             Such are the  leading  provisions of what is obviously one of the           most important  delegating enactments which Parliament has ever           passed but we do not feel justified in attempting an estimate of so           far-reaching  a measure at so early a stage in its existence.1&quot;&apos;(H)Instanccs   (I) In each of eight modern Acts of Parliament, passed betweenof powers to 1888 and  1929,  power  has been  conferred  on  the appropriateoTparliaCtS M^ister to modify the provisions of the Act so far as may appearment&apos;either to him to  be necessary  for  the  purpose of  bringing the Act intothe  Act by operation.which thepowers are    In the Local  Government Act, 1894,113 the like power was con-delegated,or ferred on the appropriate County Council.other Acts.The &quot;Henry   This class of  enactment  has acquired the  nickname of  &quot; theVf11  ,,    Henry VIII clause &quot;  because that King is regarded popularly as           the impersonation of executive autocracy.  Indeed it may be con-           sidered to  resemble the  famous  Statute  of Proclamations, 1539,117           Which gave  the King  power to  legislate by. proclamation until           it was repealed  on Henry&apos;s death in 1547.118  The comparison is           certainly far-fetched.             The purpose of Henry VIII  was to enlarge his powers to make           proclamations having  the force of law.   The sole purpose of Par-           liament  on the  nine occasions  when  it  passed the modern  enact-           ment  was to  enable minor adjustments  of its own   handiwork           to be made for  the purpose  of  fitting its principles into the fabric           of existing legislation,  general or local, and  of meeting cases of           hardship to Local Authorities.           1,51 Sections 7 and 12.           1&quot;B Section 7  (2).           ll51* Section 19.           1151 Section  2, ss.  6.           lisj ip]ie &quot;Wheat Quota  Bill has also been introduced into the House ot                 Commons:  but as the Committee stage has not yet concluded we                 refrain  from comment.           i&quot; 50 &amp; 57 Viet., c. 73.           117 31 Henry  8, c.  8.           &quot;* 1 Edw.  6,  c. 12.
150  In eight of the nine instances the provision was transitory, andthe last of them the provision  contained  in Section 130 of theLocal  Government Act,  1929110 ceased to  have effect  on 31stDecember, 1930.  The exception is Section 80 of the Local Govern-ment Act, 1894&apos;&quot;1 (which as we have seen above confers powers onthe County Council and not on any Minister), which is permanentin its effect; but as it relates to difficulties arising with respect tothe holding of the first parish meeting or the first election of parishor district  councillors, it  has no  longer  any operation except asregards newly created parishes or districts.  All  these nine enactments  will be  found set  out in Annex IIto this&apos;Report.   (II)  Before we turn to Acts conferring power on the Executive Theto amend other Acts, it may be interesting  to mention an interest- Enablinging example of  what  at first sight  seem to be,  but  are  not, /*c&apos;&apos;powers of delegated legislation, which  is to  be  found in the church of England Assembly (Powers) Act,  1919,120 commonly known asthe Enabling Act.   By that Act  the Church Assembly, a  subordinate  body,  is em-powered to propose  legislation &quot; touching  matters concerning theChurch of England.&quot;  The measures  so proposed may  &quot; extend to &quot; the repeal or amendment of Acts of Parliament including theChurch Assembly Act itself.   But although all the initial  stages oflegislation  are  thus  left to the exclusive jurisdiction of  the  sub-ordinate body,  and although  Parliament has reserved to  itself no power of amending the measure so framed, it is not until Parliamentitself i.e.  The  King, Lords and  Commons have conferred on itlegislative force by an affirmative address of each House, followedby the Royal Assent, given in the same way as to an ordinary Bill,that the measure is converted from a draft into  legislation.  the example thus falls  into precisely the same constitutional  categoryas  the  provisional  order  procedure   (see  paragraph   5),  andalthough by its procedure the Enabling Act does permit of existing acts of Parliament being altered, the alteration is  in  fact  made byParliament itself and not by the Church Assembly.  In essence theChurch Assembly Act is not an instance of delegated  legislation.   Turning now to  Acts which confer power on the  Executive to Powers toamend other Acts, we  find  a typical example in  the Juries Act, amend other1922,121  where   power is  given  to  make  provision by  Order in Acts-Council  for making  such  adaptations  in any enactments  as arenecessary for giving full effect to the Act.   Another is contained in Section 20 of the Mental Treatment Act,1930,122 which empowers the Minister of Health by order to modify the wording of  any enactment so far as is necessary to bring it into1,8 19 &amp; 20 Geo. 5, c.  17.120 9 A 10 Geo. 5, c. 76.121 12 &amp; 13 Geo. 5, c. 11, s.  6.&apos;22 20 &amp; 21 Geo.  5, c.  23.
           conformity with the provisions of the section.  It should be noted           that the whole section  relates only to terminology, its intention           being to replace certain statutory expressions in previous use by           others which  at the moment were regarded as less offensive.             Provisions of greater  importance, however, are  to  be found in           the Local  Government  (Scotland) Act, 1929,a  measure which           effected sweeping changes in the system  of  local government in           Scotland.  By Section 76 the Secretary of  State  was empowered                 (A)  between the 16th of May, 1929, and the  31st of  December,                      1930, to  make by order &quot; any adaptations  or modifica-                      tions of  the  provisions of any  Act necessary  to bring                      those provisions into conformity with the provisions of                      this Act &quot;.                (B)  At any time after the 16th of May, 1929, to make by order                      &quot; such adaptations in the provisions of any local Act as                      may seem to  him to be necessary in order to make those                      provisions conform with the provisions  of  this  Act, or                      in  order to make an equitable adjustment or apportion-                      ment of  any expenditure  or payment under the local                      Act, consequent on  the carrying into effect of the  pro-                      visions of this Act &quot;.             A somewhat similar power is conferred  on  Local Authorities in           regard to town planning schemes  by  sub-section (2) of  Section 55           of the Housing, Town  Planning,  etc.,  Act, 1909,  as  amended by           Section 44 of the Act of 1919.1=4(iii)          There are on the  Statute Book several enactments which conferInstances of powers on a  Minister and contain no limiting definition of those powers con- p0werS; but leave everything to the Ministers discretion in plainwide&quot;a Silis- but Wide language such as &quot; to carry out this Act &quot; or &quot; to givecretion on a effect to the provisions of this Act &quot;.  The  Poor Law Act of 1834&apos;&quot;Minister    quoted above  under Class (i) of the &quot; Exceptional &quot; type is itselfthat it is   a g00(i illustration.   Another  example is afforded by  the Patents,impossible  designs and Trade Marks Acts, 1883&apos;&quot; and 1888.121  Sub-section  1to know    of Section 1  of the later Act provides  that after the 1st of July,what limit  1889, a person shall not be entitled to describe himself  as a patentParliament  agent, unless he  is registered as  a patent agent in pursuance offoVnws^e1  the Act-   Sub-section (2) provides that the Board of Trade  shall o impose.  mg^e sucu general rules as are in the opinion  of the Board required           for giving  effect to the section.           123  19 &amp; 20 Geo. 5,  c. 25.           121 9 Edw. 7, c. 44 and 9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 35 :  see also Clause 11  (1) b of the                 Town and Country Planning Bill now before Parliament.           135  4 &amp; 5 Will. 4, c. 76, s. 15.           128  46 &amp; 47 Viet., c. 57.           127  51 &amp; 52 Viet., c. 50.
15  The meaning of the  section,  as affecting  the validity of  theRegister of Patent Agents Rules, 1889, which were made under it by the Board of Trade,  was considered by the House of Lords inInstitute  of Patent  Agents v. Lockwood,  1894 A.C. 347.   TheHouse decided  that the  section left the whole scheme to the  dis-cretion of the Board of Trade, and that it was therefore not withinthe  province of a  Court  of Law  to canvass the merits of  theparticular scheme embodied in the Rules of 1889.  It is  worth noticing that  the Lord  Chancellor (Lord  Herschell)expressed  the  opinion that judicial control of the scheme wouldnot have,been an improvement on the method of legislation whichhad  been followed in  the section.  Another  example is to be found  in  Part IV of the Road traffic act,  1930,128 which  provides  for the regulation of  public  servicevehicles.   The  regulation of such vehicles is  committed to bodies of Traffic Commissioners established  by -the  Act,  but  Section 81gives wide  rights of appeal from their decisions to the Minister ofTransport, and empowers  him on  any such appeal  to  make such order as he thinks fit, and provides that any such order shall be binding on the  Commissioners.  Parliament,  no doubt, considered that Part IV of  that Act wasone of  those enactments, regulating improvements for  the benefitof the general  public, of which  Lord Watson said in Lockwood&apos;scase (referred  to  above) that every neighbouring  member of thepublic has a certain  interest in  seeing them enforced, and that itwould  never do to  permit the  Civil Courts  to  adjudicate as tothem.128128 20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5, c. 43.                                          ,   We  invite particular attention to the above statutes as illustrations     of the inseparable mingling,  which so often  appears  in  delegated     legislation, of  the theoretically separate functions of legislation  and     justice.  In so far as  the delegated legislation regulates the life of     the community for the future  on certain [principles it is true logisla-     tion.  In so far  as the application of the rules so made affects tho     rights of persons (individual or corporate), dispute may arise about     the existence  or  not  of  the  conditions  precedent upon which  tho     Ministers right to make or  apply  his legislation depends.   If such a     dispute arises,  it is a justiciable issue, and its determination  is a truly     judicial function.  But in practical politics an academic attempt to     draw the theoretical line may be contrary to common sense; it  may     Ue necessary to leave all such questions, legislative and judicial, to the     executive discretion of  the Minister.  Any other course may be incon-     sistent with good administration.  But it is important to  remember     that what is  truly legislative  may  also have a judicial aspect;  and     this truth underlies the famous judgment of lord Atkin in the case of     Rex. v. Electricity Commissioners  (1924)  1 K.B1 p. 171.
(iv)InstanceswhereParliament,withoutformallyabandoningits normal practice oflimitingdelegatedpowers, hasin effectdone so byforbiddingcontrol bythe Courts.The limita-tions ofdelegatedpower.  In many statutes Parliament has provided that the Minister maymake an  order under  the Act, and that the  order when  made&quot; shall have effect as if enacted in this Act.&quot;  The latter half of theprovision has been much discussed, and criticised, on the assump-tion  that  it prevented  a  Court of Law  from  inquiring into theorder.  All such criticism has, however, been laid to rest by the decisionof the House of Lords  in  Minister of Health v. The King (on the prosecution of Yaffe), 1931 A.C. 494, in  which the House laid it down, that while the provision makes the order.speak as if it werecontained in the Act, the Act in which it is  contained is the Actwhich empowers the making of  the order, and that therefore, ifthe order  as made conflicts with the Act, it will have to give wayto the Act.  In other  words, if in  the opinion of the  Court theorder is inconsistent with the provisions of the  Act which authorisesit, the order will be bad.  It is, therefore, clear that the validity of any order made  undera provision  so  worded remains legally open to  question, and thatit is only  when what is done falls within the  limits of  the powers conferred, and conforms to the conditions imposed, that  the  orderacquires the force of law.  Some statutes however contain a  different and  more  elaborateprovision which seems  on its face to have been designed with the express purpose of completely and finally excluding all control bythe Courts.  It runs as follows :       &quot; The Minister may confirm the order  and the confirmation    shall be conclusive evidence that the  requirements of this Act    have  been complied with,  and  that  the  order has  been duly    made and  is within the powers of this Act.&quot;130  This type of provision has not yet been considered by the Houseof Lords, and we therefore refrain from expressing a definite opinionupon its scope  and effect.  It is, however, we  think, plain that theprotection  afforded even by  this clause is not limitless.  If theMinister of Agriculture  and Fisheries went  out of his provincealtogether  in   confirming  an &quot; order &quot;  (i.e.  a regulation)  underSection 39 of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 190S ;131  if,for example, he confirmed an order  which provided for boiling  the bishop of Rochester^ cook to death,133 we doubt whether the order would be  protected  by this section,  although, if a  new  Act  ofParliament were  to be passed  expressly conferring  such a power,the order would be unassailable.130 See for example, the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 190S, (8 Edw. 7,      c. 36), s. 39, and.  the Housing Act, 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5, c. 14), Third      Schedule.   8 Edw. 7, c. 36.,3S See 22 Hen. 8, c. 9, cited above in paragraph 3.
152  But  the clause is objectionable, and we doubt whether it is everjustified.  In exceptional cases where  Parliament may determinethat it  is necessary to confer on  a  Minister the- power  to  make regulations whose validity is not to be  open to challenge  in theCourts, the  enabling  statute should declare this intention in  clear and precise language.  We  revert to  this topic in paragraph  14on  page 61  below where we discuss judicial control over delegated legislation.  There are certain Acts which  confer power on Ministers to add to lists of subject matter contained in Schedules e.g. the Poisonsand Pharmacy Act, 1908&apos;&quot;  and the Trade Board Acts, 1909 and1918&apos;&quot;-or even to alter them e.g. the Companies Act, 1929&apos;&quot;.Such a power, no doubt, in a legal  sense involves amendment ofthe Act, but it is not amendment in the sense in which the criticsobject  to delegated power to  amend Acts of Parliament, becausethe lines along which amendment should move are clearly laid  downin the amending Act  itself.   Such cases may therefore, properly beregarded as nearer to the normal than the exceptional.               Safeguards provided by Parliament.   9. Apart  from  the jurisdiction of the Courts of Law  to decide whether a Minister  has acted within the limits  of  his  delegatedpower, what  safeguards have we against  abuse  or objectionableexercise of such  power?   Parliament,  recognising the danger  of such exercise, has  takencare to provide two special safeguards, although they do not operate in all cases :     (a)  the stipulation in the delegating  enactment that the regula-           tions made  thereunder shall be laid before Parliament;     (b) the system of  publicity  provided for by the Rules Publica-           tion Act,  1893.&apos;&quot;   (a)  There is no general statute (neither the Rules Publication Act  Laying itself  nor any other) which requires regulations to be laid  before  beforeParliament; but in many cases the delegating statute itself requires  Porhor,the regulation to be  so laid.   The requirement that the regulationshall be laid takes different forms in various statutes, e.g. :       (i) Laying with no  further directions      (ii) Laying -with provision that, if within a specified period           of  time a  resolution  is passed  by either House for           annulling (in some cases for annulling or modifying) the133 8 Edw. 7, c. 55. 131 9 Edw. 7, o. 22, and  8 &amp; 9 Geo. 5,  c. 32. 135 19 &amp; 20 Geo. 5, c. 23. ,3G 56 &amp; 57 Viet., c. 66. 137 e.g.  regulations under the  Foreign Marriage Act, 1892  (55 &amp; 56 Viet.,      c. 23):  see s. 21  (2).
           regulation, the regulation may or shall be annulled or           modified, as the case may be, by Order in Council;1&quot;      (iii) Laying with  provision  that the regulation  shall  not           operate,  until approved by resolution;  or  shall  not           operate beyond a certain specific period, unless approved           by resolution within  that period.&apos;&quot;  Sometimes it is an           affirmative resolution of both  Houses, but  sometimes           only of the  House  of  Commons (e.g., orders of  the           Board of  Trade  under  the  Safeguarding of Industries           Act, 1921, already  mentioned on page 32);     (iv) Laying in draft for a certain number of days ;uo      (y) Laying in draft with provision that the regulation is not           to   operate  till  the  draft  has  been  approved   by           resolution.1&quot;It is impossible to discover any rational justification for the  exist-ence of so many different forms of  laying  or on what principleParliament acts in deciding which should  be adopted in any par-ticular  enactment.  In cases in  which regulations are subject  to  annulment  if  aresolution  is  passed  within  a specific number of  days,  there  areextraordinary and quite  illogical differences in the  number of daysspecified in  different  statutes.  In some cases  the number  is as great as 100; in others it is as  small as 20.&apos;&quot;  Between these ex-tremes  lie periods of 40, 36, 30, 28 and 21 days;  28 and 21 daysare common.   In most cases  &quot;  days &quot;  means &quot; sitting days,&quot;  i.e.days on which  Parliament actually sits, but sometimes parliament has  neglected to&apos; specify that the days are to be sitting  days.  It is  usually  provided  that annulment shall be without prejudice to the  validity of any action already taken under the regulationwhich is annulled.&apos;43138 e.g. regulations under the Housing &amp;c. Act. 1919 (9 &amp;. 10 Geo. 5, c.  35):      see s. 7 (3):  and rules under the Nurses Registration Act,  1919      (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 94): see s. 3 (4).139 e.g.  orders for the  compulsory acquisition of  land by the Minister  of      Health  on behalf of an authorised Association under Section 16  of      the Town  Planning  Act,  1925 (15  &amp; 16  Geo. 5, c. 16) and rules      modifying  and adapting an enactment made by the Board of Control      under the  Lunacy Aot, 1890  (53 &amp;  54 Viet.,  c. 5) see  the Mental      Treatment Act, 1930  (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5, c. 23)  S. 15 (2).110 e.g.  Orders in Council under the Ministry of Health  Act, 1919 (9 &amp; 10      Geo.  5, c.  21,  S.  8 (2) ).141 e.g.  certain parts of draft Orders in  Council  in regard to  census par-      ticulars  under the Census Act, 1920 (10 &amp; 11  Geo. 5, c.  41, s. 1 (2)      and Schedule).143 The  maximum of 100 days occurs in the Supreme Court of Judicature      (Ireland) Act, 1877 (40 &amp;  41 Viet., c. 57, s.  69),  applicable now to      Northern Ireland  by  virtue of subsection (1) of  Section 41  of  the      Government of  Ireland Act,  1920  (10 &amp;  11 Geo.  5,  c.  67);  the      minimum of 20 days applies to regulations under the Unemployment      Insurance  Act,&apos; 1920  (10 &amp;  11 Geo. 5, c.  30, s. 35 (3).143 See,  for example, Housing &amp;o.  Act, 1919 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 35), s. 7 (3).
153  The procedure of the two Houses is similar but not identical.   In House ofthe House of Lords notice of all papers presented to the House  Lords.including both  regulations and  draft regulations appears  in  thefirst instance in the Minutes of Proceedings.   A  separate printedlist of  those papers required by  Act of Parliament  to be laid  onthe Table of the House for a specified number of days is published,showing  the  Act under which  the paper  is prescribed and  thenumber of days it is required to lie.  This  list is circulated to  allPeers from time to time, on an average once a fortnight.  In the case of regulations subject to annulment,  the period forwhich  the regulation is  required to lie  before Parliament is  not usually less than 21 days; and  as in most  cases these are sittingdays, the period covers about two months.  These regulations there-fore appear in  the printed list  circulated to Peers two or three times before the period expires.  All papers  presented to the Houseare kept  in  the  Journal Office,  where they  are  available  for examination.  In the House of Commons the procedure is much the same; i.e., House of notice of all papers presented appears first in the daily Votes and Commons.Proceedings  arid a separate printed list of these papers  is also prepared and  supplied to any Member who desires it.  Twenty-onesitting  days is equivalent to  not less than one rhonth  in the caseof the House of Commons and the list is published once a week.  When  a regulation is technically laid  on the Table of the Houseof Commons, the actual  document is placed in the Library of theHouse.   By direction of  Mr. Speaker the public Departments havebeen notified on several occasions  that such  documents ought tobe  presented  in duplicate,  and this is now  usually done, but isoccasionally neglected.&quot;*  When it  is done, one copy is filed along with copies of similar papers, and placed on a central table in oneof the  rooms  of the Library, where  it is open to the inspection ofany Member  who  wishes  to  see  it.  But  as  the custody andpreservation of  the document is important, the other copy is lockedup, and  a Member who wishes to see  it must  ask the Librarianor another responsible official to produce it.  If only one copy is presented, this is always locked up, but can be  produced at anytime for inspection.  In the House of Lords a Peer who wishes to direct the attention procedure of the  House  to a  regulation lying on the Table can do so  by  a for Debatemotion for papers,  which  admits of a division, or by a question, House ofwhich  does not.                                                 Lord$-  In the case  of any regulation subject to annulment  any  Peercan, of course, move the necessary resolution  to  annul and,  ifnecessary, divide the House.&quot;* So we are informed by officers of the House.
House ofCommons.The RulesPublicationAct, 1S9S.  In the House of Commons any Member can move an -iddress ormotion  to annul or disapprove  a regulation or a draft regulation.In the case of any regulation which by statute  is expressly madeliable to annulment within  a  stated  period, such  an address is&quot; exempted business,&quot; can be taken after 11 p.m.,  and  admits ofa division.   But in the case of any other regulation a Member who wishes to move an  address or  motion must find  time during theordinary sittings of the House,  which as a rule is impracticable;and the  Member  desiring to raise the question  must  therefore doso on the motion for adjournment during the limited time between11 and 11.30 p.m. when no division is  allowed.  In theory  a Member of  the House of Commons who  wishes to direct attention to a regulation lying on the Table  can  do so anyevening in which the House is  sitting by  raising the question on the motion  for the adjournment;  but  in  practice such a  thing is hardly ever done.  Any  Member of the House  of  Commons can ask a question about a regulation lying on the  Table, and  many questions are soasked; but no debate can take place in the House of Commons, asin the  House  of  Lords,  on a  question,  although  the  indirectinfluence of  a question upon the Department concerned  is  oftenconsiderable,  and may  produce a degree of effect which would sur-prise  the Member who uses  this modern weapon of the House ofCommons for controlling the Executive.  (6) Antecedent  publicity  is  undoubtedly a  safeguard  of thehighest value particularly where it leads to consultation with theinterests concerned; and Section 1 of the Bules Publication  Act,1893,143  aims at securing  such  publicity  in  the  case  of such&quot; statutory  x-ules &quot;  as  fall  within its scope.  The expression &quot; statutory rules &quot; is defined in Section 4 of theAct.  The definition makes  it  clear ithat the expression only  ex-tends to &quot;  rules,&quot;  &quot; regulations &quot; and  &quot; byelaws &quot;  in the  strictstatutory sense of those words; so that &apos;&apos; orders &apos;&apos; are not withinthe scope  of Section  1  at all  unless they contain  &quot; rules &quot; or&quot; regulations &quot;.  The section applies to  all &quot; statutory rules &quot; which are requiredto be laid before Parliament other than :     (i)  &quot;  Statutory rules &quot; required either to be laid, or to be laid           in draft, for a period before coming into operation :&quot;! 56  &amp; 57 Viet., c. 66.
154    (ii)  &quot; Statutory rules &quot; made by either the Minister of Health          as successor to the Local  Government  Board, or the          Board of Trade, or  the Revenue Departments or by or          for the purposes of  the Post Office :                        &apos;.          or by  the  Minister  of Agriculture and Fisheries under          the Contagious Diseases  (Animals) Act, 1878,&apos;&quot; and the          Acts amending the same.  The  section does not apply to  Scotland at all.   In the  case,however, of rules made under a few  Acts of Parliament the enablingAct &quot;itself applies the  section to Scotland, e.g., the  Public Health(Regulations  as to Food) Act, 1907.1,7  Notice of a proposal to make any  &quot; statutory rule &quot; which is within the scope of the section must be  gazetted at least 40 days before the  &quot;  statutory rule &quot; is  made; and the notice must statewhere copies  of the draft regulation  can be obtained.  During the 40 days  any public  body may obtain copies of  thedraft rules at a  reasonable price, and any  representations or sug-suggestions  made  in writing by  a public  body  interested must beconsidered  by the  authority  proposing  to make the &quot; statutoryrule &quot; before it is finally  settled.  The practice  is for  the  Department  concerned  to give notice that the  draft is  on sale by the Stationery Office and thus in fact the draft can be readily obtained not only by &quot; public bodies&quot;  butby anyone interested.  It is important to observe that the ambit of Section 1 is strictly  Exclusionsdenned and that any  &quot;  statutory  rule &quot; which                      from Sec-    eith 6T  is made by  one of  certain named  Departments or for  j.&apos;ne      the purposes of the  Post Office, or by the Minister of Agri-      culture and  Fisheries under certain  Acts,  or  relates  to      Scotland,    or by whomsoever made is required to be laid before Parlia-      ment,  or to be laid  before Parliament in draft, for a period      before  taking effect,    or by whomsoever made is  not required to  be laid before      Parliament at  allis beyond the ambit of the section.  By  subsequent legislation the scope  of the section has been further limited.  A list of the further exclusions will  be found in theIndex to the  Statutes  in Force under the heading &quot; Statutory  rules and Orders, 2.   Draft rules in  certain cases.&quot;   On  the other hand there  has been a slight extension  of  the section to  certain rulestheretofore excluded.  This extension will be found under the sameheading in the Index.   41  &amp; 42 Viet.,  c. 74.   7 FAw. 7, c. 32.
             There is, however, one recent exclusion of rules from the opera-           tion of the section which must not be passed over without particular           notice.  Under sub-section 5 of Section 99 of the Supreme Court of           Judicature  (Consolidation)  Act,  1925,148  Rules  of  the Supreme           Court i.e.  the  whole  of  the  High  Court  legal   procedure            were for  the  future  entirely  excluded  from  the  operation           of Section 1 of the Rules Publication  Act, 1893.&apos;&quot;             In Northern Ireland the Rules Publication Act, 1893,148 has been           repealed  altogether  and  replaced  by  the Rules Publication  Act           (Northern  Ireland),  1925,  which  contains nothing  corresponding           to Section 1 of the 1893 Act.Provisional    But even in the case of statutory rules within the ambit of Sectionregulations.  i; Section 2 provides that where the authority emjpowered to make           the rule certifies  that on account of urgency or  any  special reason           a rule should come into immediate operation,  the authority may           make the rule come into operation forthwith as  a provisional  rule           and  continue in  force  until though  only until a rule has been           made in accordance  with the provisions of Section 1.              &quot; It was doubtless  intended,&quot;  says Mr.  Carr in  &quot; Delegated           Legislation &apos;&quot;49 &quot; that a Department which could not  wait forty           days  and which  therefore made its rules as &apos; provisional &apos;  should           convert its provisional rales into substantive rules by the statutory           process already described (Le.  in accordance with the provisions           of Section 1).  This is  usually  so done.  Thus the Ministry of           Health, having to issue its regulations under the Census Act, 1920&apos;&quot;&apos;           in a  hurry, as preparations had  to be rapidly made for the 1921           census,  certified its regulations as  urgent  and issued them as           &apos; provisional &apos; on December 21st, 1920, and followed them up by           producing  draft  rules  three  days later  which  ....  came  per-           manently into force on February 14th, 1921.   But, once rules have           been made &apos; provisional,&apos; there is no particular incentive to convert           them into non-provisional rules.&quot;              Some provisional rules  of  1911 about old  age  pensions were           reissued in modified form in 1920, but still as provisional rules, and           were not superseded by rules in final form till 1921.              In that year, however, a Treasury Circular reminded Government           Departments that  &quot; provisional rules  should in all cases be super-            superseded by rales in  final  form as  early as possible &quot; a reminder            which we endorse.              It should be noticed  that                 (a)  there are  enactments which specially provide for the ex-                      clusion  of  rales made under those enactments  from                      the ambit  of Section  1 of the Rules Publication  Act,                      while making special provision for  antecedent  publicity            148 15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5, e. 49.            140 Page 35.            15&quot; 10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5,  e. 41.s
155          for such  rules, e.g.  Section  18 of the Mining Industry          Act,  1926,&quot;&quot; and  Section  12 of the Coroners (Amend-          ment) Act, 1926,&apos;&quot;  (see below  for the special provision          contained in each of these sections);    (6) there are enactments on the other hand which  expressly          provide for the inclusion of rules made under these enact-          ments, which would not apart from such express pro-          vision be within the ambit of the section, e.g. the Town          Planning Act, 1925.&apos;&quot;While Section 1 of  the Rules Publication  Act,  18931&quot;  provides  for Publicationantecedent publicity, Section 3 and Treasury  regulations    made of regu-tliereunder provide for subsequent publicity as regards regulations  &quot; ,0&quot;s&quot;sent to the  King&apos;s Printer.1&quot;  Nearly  every  regulation sent  to  the King&apos;s Printer  which  is general and  not  local in character is under existing practice  printedforthwith in separate form.15&apos;  At the end of  every year the  Stationery Office publishes a  volumecalled &quot; Statutory Rules and  Orders,&quot; containing the text of nearly all regulations similar to public general Acts and a classified list oflocal regulations made in the course of the year and still in force.158.  At  the end of every third year it  publishes an  Index  to the&quot; Statutory  Rules and Orders &quot; in force.  &quot; The creation of this official system of publication has removedthe reproach that  the law  embodied in  statutory  rules was lesswell known  and less easy to find than the law embodied in acts of Parliament.&quot;15&apos;  Special safeguards for antecedent  publicity are sometimes con- Specialtained  in   particular  statutes.    The  following  are  typical statutoryillustrations-                                                     safeguards.    (a) the  power of the Board of Trade to appoint committees for          the   purpose of advising  them  when  considering the          making or alteration of any rules,  regulations or scales          for the  purpose of  the  Merchant  Shipping  Acts, con-          sisting of such persons as they may appoint  representing          the interests principally affected or having special know-          ledge of  the subject matter  :160151 16  &amp; 17 Geo. 5, o. 28.   16  &amp; 17 Geo. 5., o. 59.153 15  &amp; 16 Geo.  5, c. 16.151 56  &amp; 57 Viet., c.  66.155 Regulations, dated August 9th, 1894, made by  the Treasury with the     concurrence  of  the Lord  Chancellor  and the Speaker  of the  House     of Commons in  pursuance  of the Rules Publication Act, 1893 (1894 :     No. 734).

   (6) the elaborate provision for publication,  consideration  of          objections, and  public  inquiry  in  connection with the          making by the  Secretary of State of regulations under          the Factory  and Workshop Act,  1901,&quot;l  which are          contained in  Sections 80 and 81 of that Act :    (c) the elaborate machinery for publication,  consideration  of          objections, and  public  inquiry  in connection with the          making  by ttie  Minister of Labour of  special orders          under  the Trade Boards Act,  1918,&apos;&quot;  which are con-          tained in the first Schedule to that Act:    (6) the similar provisions in connection with  the confirmation          by the Minister of Transport of special orders made  by          the  Electricity   Commissioners under   the  Electricity          (Supply)  Act,  1919,&apos;&quot;  which  are  contained  in  the          Schedule to that Act:    (e) the provision in the Seeds Act,  1920,1114  for  consultation          between the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and          representatives  of the  interests concerned  before the          Minister makes regulations for  the  purpose  of  carrying          the Act  into effect :    (/) the provision in the London Traffic  Act,  1924,165  for con-          sultation between the  Minister of  Transport  and  the          London  and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee          before the Minister makes regulations :    (g)  the provision in Section  18 of the Mining Industry Act,           1926,  for consultation  between  the  Minister of Labour          and  representative  associations  before  the  Minister          makes regulations under the section :166    (/i) the provisions in Section  12 of the Coroners&apos; (Amendment)           Act, 1926,167 in connection with orders  for the formation           or  alteration of County Coroners&apos; districts.  Quite apart from the above statutory obligations, departments are naturally at pains to consult freely all interested bodies, where possible,  in   the  ordinary course  of running  their  businessesefficiently.   1.

156                    Drafting of Regulations.  10. There  is one aspect of the unsystematized character of ourconstitutional procedure for delegated legislation to which we wish  draftinto draw  special attention.  Whereas the  drafting of government bills is done  in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, barristersselected  for that office and by long training therein acquiring thehighest skill  as draftsmen, the drafting of regulations is only  incertain cases (for example, regulations which  are  made by theTreasury)  done  by  or  under  the supervision  of  parliamentary counsel.   In other eases it is  done by the various Departments,usually (though not invariably)  by  their legal branches.   The work is there  largely in the hands of persons who,  however  able and.experienced  in  their  own work,  do not  possess the very  specialdrafting  experience  of the  Parliamentary Counsel.  We do notattach so much importance to the fact  that occasionally the drafts-men are  not lawyers; a man may be either a solicitor or counsel andvet not have had the training  which is essential to make a gooddraftsman, for good draftsmanship is an art which calls for special qualifications and long experience.  By it we mean the  power ofclear,  lucid and simple expression of the intended  purport of  thedraft,  and of keeping within the legal limitations intended by Par-liament.  As things stand,  under the existing procedure  of leaving the drafting of regulations to the Departments the work is uneven some is good and some is bad.  Eegulations on the whole  tend to be somewhat less well drafted than Government Bills as originally pre-sented to Parliament,1&quot;  which  are all  drawn in the Office of Par-liamentary Counsel.   The  work  of  Bill  drafting may sometimessuffer even there from the pressure or urgency of Cabinet  demands,but that  does not touch our principle that drafting is a skilled task and that Parliamentary Counsel have the skill.  The present practice does not merely mean that there is a riskof  regulations  being less  thoroughly drafted  and  less  clearlyexpressed  than Bills  as originally presented to Parliament,  butthat there  is an absence of the safeguards afforded by the specialskill, training and position  of the Parliamentary Counsel, with the inevitable  consequence,  for instance,  of an  increased risk of  theMinister, on whom the  power  of making regulations is  conferred,assuming to  himself, in the  terms of the  regulations   which  hemakes,  powers more  extensive than  those conferred by the  Actunder which  the regulations are made,  and it is said by some criticsthat this result is not infrequent.   Sir  William  Graham-Harrison,   the  Senior   parliamentary counsel, is of opinion that where Parliament  delegates legislative powers,  whether to  His  Majesty in  Council,  or  to  a  particular108 The office of Parliamentary Counsel is obviously not responsible for  the      final language of the Act when it receives the Royal Assent, in so      far as it  results  from amendments made in Parliament.
            Minister, those powers cannot, without express authorisation from            Parliament, be passed on by His Majesty in Council or the Minister            to any other body or person ; and we agree with this view.  He has            pointed out to us, however, that the principle is not always  realised            by draftsmen of regulations and while we do not wish to specify            any particular regulation we have in mind by way of illustration            two cases where  neglect of the principle  has,  we are inclined to            think, resulted in the making of regulations or orders which  for this            reason are probably ultra vires.Importance    &quot;jjjbe importance of good drafting  cannot be  overemphasised, anddrafting     ^e more resort to delegated legislation is practised by Parliament,            the more necessary is it that its draftsmanship should be uniformly            good.  We feel that the existing system of Departmental drafting            does not fully ensure that the standard shall in all cases be up to            that of  the  best draftsmanship or even satisfy .a lower  test.            Prevention is both  better  and less expensive than cure.  If ten            cases of ultra vires  regulations occur to-day,  and  nine of  them            would  be  avoided by ^a general improvement in  the standard of            drafting,  it is obvious that  an important  public advantage would            be achieved, and one peculiarly relevant  to the object of our refer-            ence.  If we  assume that legal proceedings i-result in two or  three            of the ten cases,  the saving of expense  direct and indirect which            would  result is in itself a public economy.  But the value of good            drafting is not limited to  the  avoidance of  illegalities.   In the            ordinary life of the community what is above  all important is that            legislation,  whether delegated or original, should be expressed in            clear language.Suggestions   No doubt a general improvement  such  as we desire may necessi-for im-      tate some increase  in  staff;  but even  in present conditions ofprovement.   economic exigency,  we are  satisfied that  the proposal is wise on            the ground inter alia that it is a measure of economy.  The objec-            tive might be secured  either (1)  by a direct  increase in the staff            of the Parliamentary Counsel&apos;s Office or (2)  by some scheme for            an all-service  grade of draftsman who would be available either for            work in that office  itself or for  service  in the legal  branches of            Departments  with a great  deal of  drafting work, and there may            be  other ways.   The  first  proposal would involve the gradual            creation of a central supervising drafting Department which would            tend to secure uniformity of practice  and would have the effect of            applying a wider general experience  to  the detailed parts of the            work;  but it  would  be several years before a  sufficient staff could            be trained up for such supervision.  We do not,  however, regard            the problem of  choosing between the several methods as directly            covered by our terms of reference, and therefore make no attempt            to appraise their respective advantages and disadvantages.             We  think  it  sufficient  to recommend that the  whole  subject            should be taken into immediate consideration  by the Departments            concerned  and the Treasury.
15?                     Necessity for Delegation.  11. We have  already1&quot; expressed the  view that  the system  ofdelegated legislation is both legitimate and constitutionally desir-able for  certain  purposes, within certain  limits,  and under certainsafeguai-ds.  We proceed  to set out  briefly mostly  by way  ofrecapitulation the  reasons which have led us to  this conclusion :   (1) Pressure upon Parliamentary time  is great.  The more pro-  Pressure oncedure and subordinate  matters  can  be  withdrawn from detailed  Parliament-Parliamentary discussion, the greater will  be the  time which Parlia-  ar&apos;J tline-ment can devote to the consideration of essential  principles  in egislation.  ^2) The subject matter of modern  legislation  is very often of  a  Technical-technical  nature.   Apart from  the  broad   principles  involved,  Hy of technical matters are difficult ito include in a Bill,  since they can-  s^&apos;Actnot be effectively discussed in Parliament.  As  an illustration we  &quot;&apos;a  cr-invite  attention  to  ithe  Safeguarding of  Industries (Exemption)No. 5 Order, 1931,  printed as Annex III  to this  Beport.  (3) If  large and   complex schemes  of  reform are  to be  given  Unforeseentechnical shape, it is difficult  to work out the  administrative  contingen-machinery in  time to insert in the Bill all the provisions required;  cies-it is impossible to foresee all the contingencies and  local conditions for  which provision  must eventually be made.  The National HealthInsurance Begulations, and  the Orders setting  up Trade Boards,illustrate particularly well this aspect of the problem.  (4) The practice, further, is valuable because it  provides  for  a  Flexibility.power of constant adaptation to unknown  future  conditions withoutthe  necessity  of amending legislation.  Flexibility  is  essential.170The method of  delegated legislation  permits of  the rapid utilisation-tion of experience,  and  enables  the results  of  consultation withinterests  affected by the operation of new Acts to be translated into practice.   In  matters, for  example, like  mechanical  road transport, where technical development is rapid,  and often unfore-seen, delegation  is essential to meet the new positions which  arise.169 Section I, paragraph 5.1,0 There is a very early instance of this wihich is still in force. 11 Richard II,     c.  11, refers  to an earlier  Act of 6 Richard II,  c. 5, which had     enacted that Assizes should he held in the principal and chief towns     in the counties where Shire Courts were held. The Act of 11 Richard II     says that the Act of 6 Richard II has been found prejudicial and     grievous.  It  authorises the Lord Chancellor, therefore, to vary the     provisions  &quot; notwithstanding  the  said statute &quot;.  This,  therefore, is     an  early instance of power to  vary  an  Act.  This  power under     11 Richard II lived on and was acted upon until it  was repealed and     replaced by the Assizes Act,  1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. TV, c. 71), which in     turn has been replaced by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consoli-     dation) Act, 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5, c. 49,  s. 72).
Opportun-    (5) The practice,  again, permits of experiment being made andity for      thus  affords  an opportunity,  otherwise  difficult  to ensure,  ofexperiment, utilising the  lessons of  experience.  The  advantage of  this  in           matters, for instance, like town planning, is too obvious to require           detailed emphasis.Powers&quot;01&apos;    (6) In a modern  State there are many occasions when there is           a sudden need of legislative  action.  For many such needs dele-           gated legislation is  the only  convenient or  even possible remedy.           No doubt, where there is  time, on legislative issues of  great magnitude-           tude, it  is right that Parliament itself  should  either decide what           the broad outlines of the legislation shall be, or at least indicate           the general scope of the delegated powers which it considers are           called for by the occasion.             But emergency and urgency are  matters of degree;  and the type           of need may be of greater or  less national importance.  It may  be           not only  prudent but vital for  Parliament  to  arm the  executive           Government in  advance with almost plenary power to meet occa-           sions of emergency, which  affect  the  whole  nation as in the           extreme  case  of  the Defence of the Bealm Acts1&quot;  in the Great           War, where the  exigency had arisen; or in the less extreme case           of the Emergency  Powers  Act, 1920,172 where the  exigency had           not  arisen  but power  was  conferred  to meet emergencies  that           might arise in the future.    The recent emergency statutes men-           tioned above in paragraph 8 (B) (i) afford other illustrations of the           necessity  of this method of legislation  where there is thought  to           be  need  of giving to the Government  power  to take very rapid           decisions which to be effective must possess the force of law.  There           is in truth no alternative  means by which strong measures to meet           great emergencies can be made possible; and for that reason the           means is constitutional.             But the measure of the need should be the measure alike of the           power and of its limitation.   It is of the  essence of constitutional           Government that the normal control of Parliament should  not  be           suspended either to a greater degree, or  for a longer time,  than           the exigency demands.Degrees of    We  end  these observations  with a  truism.   Emergencies areemergency,  exceptional :   and  exceptions  cannot  be  classified  in  general           language.  We  therefore make no attempt,  beyond  stating the           principle  above mentioned, to  lay  down any general rules  about           the  delegation  by  Parliament  to  the Executive of  powers  to           legislate on occasions of  emergency.  It may  suffice  for purposes           of more  limited  exigency to  arm particular Departments of State           with jpower to pass emergency regulations for dealing with specific           difficulties suddenly  arising and calling for instant  preventive or           &quot;A The earlier  Acts were replaced by the consolidating and  amending Act                (5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5, c. 8).           171 10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5, c. 55.s
remedial steps in their special field of administration.  Epidemicsare a good example of the latter need; and we may recall that asfar back as 1832 an  Act&apos;&quot; passed in consequence  of  an outbreakof cholera  gave  the Privy Council power to make  general regula-tions to prevent  the spread of the disease.   Similarly at the presenttime the Minister of Agriculture has extensive powers  under the diseases of Animals  Acts  1S94&apos;7&apos;1 to 1927&apos;&quot; to make orders for preventing and  checking diseases of animals  and for preventingtheir introduction into Great Britain; of which  a striking recent example is the Animals (Importation) Order 1930.17&apos;   Summary of Arguments of the critics of Delegated Legislation.   12. Eor  these reasons  a  system of delegated  legislation  is in-dispensable.  Indeed  the  critics of the system do not seek to denyits necessity in  some form.  Their  complaint lies  rather againstthe volume and  character of delegated legislation than against thepractice of delegation itself; and in so far as they base their com-plaints on criticism of the administration as such, we doubt whether hey are clearly conscious of any  distinction between the legisla-tion of Parliament itself and the delegated legislation of  Ministers.We agree  with  them in thinking that there are real dangers inci-dental to delegated legislation; and we think it may be convenient10  summarize the  main  criticisms,  although we do  not therebycommit ourselves  to  complete concurrence with the critics.   our views of the dangers, and of the possibility of adequate  safeguards against them,  are indicated in the  recommendations  which we make in paragraphs  14 and 15.   (1) Acts of Parliament may be passed only in skeleton form and  s]ceietoncertain only the barest general principles.  Other matters of principle,  legislation.transcending procedure and the details of administration, matters which closely affect the rights and property of the subject, may beleft to be worked out  in the Departments, with the result that lawsare  promulgated which  have not been made  by,  and  get  littlesupervision from Parliament.  Some of the critics suggest that this practice has so far passed all reasonable limits, as to have assumed the character of a serious invasion of the sphere of Parliament bythe Executive.   The extent of its adoption is, they argue,  excessive,and leads  not  only  to widespread suspicion and distrust of themachinery of Government,  but actually endangers our  civic and personal liberties.   (2) The facilities afforded to Parliament to scrutinise and control  inadequatethe exercise of powers delegated to Ministers are inadequate.  There  scrutiny inis a danger that the servant may be transformed into the  master.    Parliament.l&quot; 2 &amp; 3 &quot;Will.

Their  true bearing is  rather thatof safe-     there are dangers in the  practice; that it is liable to abuse ; and thatguards.     safeguards are required.   Nor do we think that either the published           criticisms or the evidence we  have received justifies  an alarmist           view of the  constitutional situation.   What the  system lacks  is           coherence and uniformity  in operation.  Its defects,  as we have           sought  to show, are  the inevitable consequence  of its haphazard           evolution.  Our recommendations  are intended  to remove these           defects;  and  we  believe that  they should  go far to meet  the           difficulties which the  critics have indicated.   For the most part the           dangers are potential  rather than actual; and the problem  which           the critics raise is essentially one of  devising the best safeguards.                        Drafting and Interpretation of Statutes.Results of     13. From time to time strong expressions of opinion have fallen tUrt^ m ^lom our JU(:jges upon the drafting of some  of our  statutes.   It has           been said that the language of the particular provision is ambiguous           and its meaning obscure : or that the method of legislation by refer-           ence is  bound  to  create confusion.   No  doubt there is occasional           cause for such criticism.  And  equally undoubted  is the inevitable           consequence  of such  ambiguities that occasionally the meaning           177 We consider  in Section III  the bearing upon our terms of reference                 of  the  whole  subject of the existing limitations,  recognised  by  the                 law of England (and Scotland must be distinguished) upon the sub-                 jectfs right of  redress against the Crown.  The point has some  rele-                 vance. here, but a reference to Section III will  suffice for  present                 purposes.
which the Court discerns in  the language used  is not in fact themeaning  which Parliament  intended  it  to bear.   And  from  thisoccasional consequence some students of politics have been tempted to doubt the suitability of the legal mind  to interpret the statutoryintention of a democratic Parliament bent on social  legislation  of afar-reaching and often novel character.&apos;&quot;&quot;  We  mention this atti-tude towards  the Law Courts because  we  think a certain section ofpublic opinion may be disposed to adopt it.  But in truth those  whoso think mistake the cause.  It is not  that the legally trained mindis prone to mis-interpret social legislation, but that the language ofthe legislation is not always clear enough to prevent the risk of  mis-interpretation.   Consequently  the remedy to  which  that section ofpublic opinion seems to lean of entrusting the interpretation of suchstatutes to administrative officers in the civil  service  would  not  cure    Those who believe  that the alleged failure of  the Courts to give effect      to tho true intentions of Parliament is due to their want of sympathy      with democratic  legislation may  be  recommended to study  the  cases      of Ellerman Lines, Ltd. v. Murray and White Star Line, etc., Co.  v.      Comcrford, 1930  p. 197;  1931 A.C. 126, in which Lord Merrivale  (who      tried the actions) the Court  of Appeal  and the House of  Lords  all      held  that  under section 1  of the Merchant Shipping  (International      Labour Conventions) Act, 1925 (15 &amp;  16 Geo. 5, c. 42) a seaman whose      service had been prematurely terminated by the wreck or loss of the      ship  was entitled  to  receive wages  at  the rate payable under  his      agreement of service for each day on which he was in fact unemployed      during a period of two  months from the date of the termination of      the service, whether his service under  the  agreement would in the      normal course  havo terminated before tho expiration of that period      or not; unless  the  owner showed that the unemployment was not due      to tho wreck  or loss of the ship or that  the  seaman was able  to      obtain suitable employment.  The Act purported to give effect to a      certain draft Convention adopted by the International Labour Con-      ference and set forth in. Part I of the First Schedule of the Act and      both Lord Justice Slesser, who dissented in  the  Court of Appeal, and      Lord Blanesburgh who  dissented in the House of Lords,  were  of      opinion  that the Convention imposed no liability  on the owner  for      days of  unemployment subsequent to the date on which the seaman&apos;s      contract  of employment  would but  for the wreck  have terminated.      Lord Blanesburgh said in the course of  his opinion (1931 A.C. 143-4)      that the effect of the decision was that Parliament, under no  inter-      national  obligation in that behalf,  in a statute which contained  no      hint of  any such intention, had gratuitously gone out of its way to      impose on  an  owner a liability to a seaman for wages for  which he      had never  contracted and,  apart from the statute, was under no con-      ceivable liability to pay.   &quot; Nor,&quot; he added, &quot; is that all; for he is to      have no return for the  payments  so  to  be made and Parliament      has  chosen as the occasion for imposing upon him  this liability  (in       relief,  it would seem,  if  the  respondent  Comerford&apos;s case may be      regarded as typical, of  the Unemployment  Insurance Fund, to  which      he  has  already  contributed)  the  moment when  the owner  is already      confronted with the total loss of his ship.&quot;  But in the result there       wero seven judicial opinions  against two that it would not be proper       to  resort to the draft  Convention  for  the  purpose  of  giving to the       section a meaning other than that  which was its natural meaning.
           the disease.   The  interpretation  of written documents,  whether           statutes, contracts, or wills, requires the trained legal mind.   To           ask the layman to perform the task just when ex hypothesi the risk           of ambiguity makes it difficult is  to make  the remedy worse than           the disease. That judges are human and sometimes make  mistakes           is irrelevant. The layman will make more.             We make these observations because on the whole subject of  our           reference public opinion is confused. That there are troubles which           call for diagnosis, and when  understood are seen to require safe-           guards, we recognize, as appears  from  our whole report.   But           troubles due to the imperfections which, avoidably or unavoidably,           are from time to time allowed still to disfigure our  Parliamentary           drafting at the moment when the Bill ripens into an Act are not  due           to any of  the causes which fall within our terms of reference;  and           we only call attention to them  because we  believe that they have           unconsciously  affected  public opinion, which  has  vaguely  but           erroneously assigned their effects to the wrong causes.The lines      The true  remedy for such troubles is to be sought along the  lineof  improve- indicated by us in para.  10 in relation to the drafting of delegated&quot;&quot;&quot;        legislation, viz., the strengthening of the Parliamentary Counsel&apos;s           office, so that its staff should be less over-worked at times of  pressure.           The principles  of statute interpretation are  clear  and well-known:           and with  that knowledge  there  must go hand in hand  the  drafts-           man^ art which is understood in that office.  Similar observations of           course apply&quot; equally to the alternative  policy of strengthening  the           staff of Departmental draftsmen which we have considered in  the           same  paragraph.Principles     The principles  of interpretation are  so  important, directly  and&quot;pretathn    indirectly, in connection with our subject that we conclude this para-           graph with  a statement upon them. We shall have occasion in the           course of Section  III to animadvert upon the distinction, so familiar           to lawyers,  between issues of fact and issues of law.&apos; If there  is a           dispute as to the  meaning of a statute this is an issue of law.   The           words of a  statute  affecting the rights of  individuals under public           law must be interpreted in the same way as the words of a contract           affecting their private rights.  The intention of the parties and the           intention of the  Legislature are alike  to  be ascertained  from  the           words that  are used and these words are  to be construed in their           plain  natural sense unless the context imposes some  other meaning           upon  them. If there is any doubt as to the meaning of words  in a           statute  &quot;  it has always  been held a safe  means of collecting  the           intention to call in aid the ground and cause of making the  statute           and to  have recourse  to the preamble which according  to Chief           Justice Dyer is a key to open the mind of the makers of the  Act           and the mischiefs which  they intended to redress &quot; :  see the Sussex           Peerage case, 11  Clark and Finelly, at p. 143. Reference  may  also
be made  to  Lord Blackburn&apos;s judgment in River  Wear commissioners-sioners v. Adamson, reported in 2 A.C., 743 at pages 763-5 :  &quot; I shall therefore state, as precisely as I can, what I understand from the  decided cases to be the principles on which the Courts ofLaw act in construing instruments in writing; and a statute is  an instrument in writing.  In all  cases the object is to see what is theintention expressed  by the words used.  But, from  the imperfectionof language,  it is impossible to know what that intention is withoutinquiring farther, and  seeing what  the  circumstances  were  withreference to which these words were used, and what was the object,appearing from those circumstances,  which the person using them had iu view;  for the meaning of words varies  according  to thecircumstances with  respect to which they were used.  But it is to beborne in  mind that  the office of the Judges is not to legislate, butto declare the expressed intention of the Legislature, even  if thatintention appears to the Court injudicious ; and I believe that it isnot  disputed that what Lord  Wensleydale used to call  the  goldenrule is right, viz., that we are to take the whole statute together, andconstrue it all together, giving the words their ordinary signification,unless when so  applied  they  produce  an  inconsistency,  or  anabsurdity or inconvenience so great as to convince the  Court thatthe  intention could not have  been to  use them in then ordinarysignification and to  justify the Court in putting on them  some othersignification which, though less proper,  is one  which  the  Courtthinks the words will bear.  In Allgood  v. Blake (L.B. 8  Ex. atpage  163),  in the judgment of  the Exchequer Chamber (which Ihad the honour to deliver)  as to the construction of a will, it is  said :&apos; The great  difficulty in all cases is in applying these rules to theparticular case; for to one mind it may appear that an  effect pro-duced by construing the words  literally is so inconsistent with therest of the will, or produces an absurdity7 or inconvenience so great,as to justify the Court in putting on them another signification,which to that mind  seems a not improper signification of the  words;whilst to another  mind  the  effect produced may  appear  not soinconsistent, absurd, or inconvenient as to justify putting any  othersignification on the words than  their proper one, and the proposedsignification may appear  a violent construction.   We  apprehendthat no precise line can be drawn, but that the Court must, in eachcase,  apply  the admitted rules  to  the  case in hand, not deviatingfrom  the literal sense of the words without sufficient reason, or morethan  is justified, yet not  adhering slavishly to them when to  do so would obviously defeat the intention which may be collected fromthe whole will.&apos;    My Lords, mutatis mutandis,  I think  this is applicable to the  construction of statutes as much as wills.  And Ithink it is correct.&quot;
  Consideration of the particular steps to be taken to improve the drafting of statutes is outside our terms of reference.  We are so im-pressed with the difficulties inherent in the Parliamentary task underthe actual  conditions of  legislation, that we have ventured to refer to certain aspects of those difficulties.  What we have  said in thisparagraph  is in truth incidental to our diagnosis  of  the mischiefscovered by our terms of reference.Inevita-bility ofdelegatedlegislation.Dangers tobe guarded against.principles to befollowed.           Opinions and conclusions of the Committee.  14. We  are  now  in a position  to  summarise our opinions andto describe the safeguards which we consider necessary.  (a) We  have already  expressed in the immediately preceding paragraphs our view  that  the delegation of legislative powers  islegitimate  for certain purposes, within certain limits, and under certain safeguards.  It is plain that it is in fact inevitable.  (b) The  practice of delegating legislative powers to Ministers  ofthe  Crown grew  without  system.  The result is  such as  must always be expected from unsystematic growth.  We  believe that the  dangerous  tendencies,  which we  observe,and  desire to see restrained, are due to the absence of system andthe lack of direction.   While we are of opinion that Parliament hasbeen right  to delegate legislative powers to Ministers of the Crown,we are equally of opinion that the methods by which those powers have been  delegated  are open to serious criticism.  We  think that Parliament  has contributed to  the abuses  ofdelegated legislation  by  paying insufficient  attention  to  the im-portance of clear and consistent terminology.  The use of  differentwords  in the same sense and  the  same word in different senses is bound to cause confusion.  But a clear  and consistent  use  of  the  English languages is not enough, if  Parliament is to keep an effective  control over ministers and  their Departments in the exercise of their delegated law-makingpowers.  We have drawn attention to the differences which we haveobserved between what  we have  called the normal  and  the es-exceptional practice of Parliament.   We doubt  whether Parliamentitself has in  the past been  aware of the difference, but we  venture to express a hope  that in the future Parliament  will be  moreconscious both  of  the principles  at  stake  and of  the safeguardsneeded; that whenever legislative  power is delegated, the  limits ofthe  power will be clearly  defined in the statute by  which it  isdelegated; that Parliament will not  depart  from the normal intothe  exceptional type of delegated  legislation without special  need,nor  without conscious  consideration of the special  grounds put
161forward as constituting the need;  and that it will grant delegatedpowers of the exceptional type e.g. powers to legislate on mattersof principle or to impose taxation only on exceptional grounds.  (c)  There can be no doubt of the extreme convenience, from the The[joint  of view of those charged with the duty of bringing into effec- &quot;JJ&quot;,^tive operation a  far reaching  measure  of reform, of a dispensing ympower such  as  that  contained  in the  so-called  &quot; Henry VIII Clause.&quot;Clause &quot;  (see paragraph 8 B  (ii) on page 36.  But again the argu-ment  of convenience may be pushed too far.  Even  though it maybe admitted that Parliament itself has conferred these powers uponMinisters, and must be  presumed to have done so with the know-ledge  of what it was doing, it cannot but be regarded  as inconsistent with  the  principles of  Parliamentary  government  that the sub-ordinate law-making authority should be given by the superior law-making authority power to amend a statute which has been passedby the  superior  authority.  It is  true that the power has  beensparingly  used175 and that it has been used with the best possiblemotives.   It may also be that  the  exercise of the power has not, inpractice, given ground for complaint.  None the less, it is a power which may  attract the  hostility and suspicion of persons affectedby its exercise, who, if  they are aggrieved by  a particular exerciseoi&apos; the power, are tempted to impute to those who exercise it motiveswhich do  not in fact exist.  We dispose, in passing,  of  the  suggestion,  unsupported as it  isby the smallest shied of evidence, that the existence of such pro-visions in certain Acts of Parliament is  due directly or indirectlyto any attempt or desire on the part of members  of  the permanentCivil  Service to secure for themselves or  for their Departments an arbitrary  power.   All that may be justly inferred from the  factsis, that Ministers have  in certain instances regarded the inclusionof provisions of this kind as essential to the successful operation of measures  which  they were proposing to Parliament.   The  power has been  asked for and granted but rai-ely, and  always subject to conditions limiting the  period of  its operation  and defining the178 Illustrations of  tlhe actual use of the clause so far  as  concerns such  of      those Acts as concern the Minister of Health will  be found in the      Ministry of Health memorandum (see first of  the companion volumes      to this Report). It will he noted that under the latest of the Acts, the      Local Government Act of 1929 (19 &amp; 20 Geo. 5, c.  17 (see Section 130),      only one  order was  made,  namely, the Local Government (Bootle      Water Rate) Order,  1929.   This order deals with an exceptional      situation  which  arose in connection  with  the County Boroughs  of      Liverpool and Bootle as the result of local legislation under which the      Liverpool Corporation provide Bootle with water  and themselves levy      and  collect a water rate chargeable on property in Bootle.  The order      was  required to make it clear that the  derating provisions apply  to      this  rate.   13307                                                      C
purposes for which it may be used.&quot;9   Even with safeguards suchas these, it is clearly a power which in theory at any rate may beunscrupulously used.  We have been assured that the National Insurance  Act, 1911&quot;&quot;&apos;could never have been  brought into operation without  the powers conferred by the  clause&quot;&quot; and that if all the powers subsequentlyobtained under the clause  had had to be included in the Bill,  itcould never  have passed into law within  any  reasonable  period.This may well be the case; but a critic naturally asks whether thatwhich was done by regulation  under  the clause after the  Billbecame an Act could not, when the need was discovered, have been expressed in a new Bill reintroduced  in  the next Session.  Apartfrom  exigencies arising  from  party politics, it would seem that  ifit does  prove necessary  in the public  interest to amend an Act ofParliament,  for  such a reason,  and the  matter  is of  sufficientpolitical  urgency, Parliamentary  time can  be  found, particularly with the aids available under Standing Orders to curtail debate on matters which have  after full debate  been settled  in the  DivisionLobby in the same or preceding Session.  It is  significant that  the so-called  &quot; Henry  VIII clause &quot; hasnot been  included in all statutes where, upon  the arguments ad-advanced  in  its favour, it might have been used.   For example, nosuch  provision is to  be  found in  the Land Drainage Act, 1930,ls:which provides for  the  reorganisation of a  complicated system oflocal administration dating from  the  Middle Ages.   If it has beenfound possible to bring certain important and complicated legislativeschemes into operation without  such a  power,  relying upon theordinary method  of an  amending Bill in Parliament to meet un-expected  contingencies, it  is not  clear why  other  enactments(mainly those connected with local government)  cannot similarly be  dealt with.  It  is probable  that,  if this provision were  no longer used, theoperation of certain large measures of reform would be somewhatdelayed.  Bills would  take longer to  prepare,  and once  the Actwas in  operation  any defect  in its provision could not be remedieduntil amending legislation had been passed.  This price, however,may  be worth  paying,  if there  is anything in  the view  that  the179 In tho course of the Debates  on the National Health Insurance Bill in      the House of Commons  in 1911, statements were made by Ministers      in charge of the Bill that the procedure  of the Henry VIII  Clause      had been used &quot; again and again in innumerable Acts of Parliament      similar to this &quot; (Mr. McKenna, on 10 November, 1911, Official Report,      5th Series, Vol. XXX, col. 2011), and that these  powers had been &quot; in      all recent Acts &quot; (Mr. Lloyd George, ibid., col.  2016).  We  think the      Ministers were under a misapprehension as the Clause had been used      seldom, and we believe that our list in the Annex is  nearly exhaustive.180 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c. 55.151 s. 78.182 20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5, c. 44 (but seo s. 41 for modification of local Acts).
162mere  existence of the power has aroused  suspicion and hostilityagainst  the  machinery of government  as it exists, and  may  wellcontinue to do so in an increasing degree : and that it is a standingtemptation to Ministers and their subordinates either to be slipshodin the preparatory work before the Bill is introduced in parliament or to  attempt to  seize for  their own  Departments the  authority which properly belongs to Parliament.  As  realists we recognise that the party system  must  qualify  tosome  extent what we have  just said.  The National Insurance Act, 19111&quot;0 may  serve as an illustration.  NecessaryWe &quot;have been told-rightly  or wrongly-that if that  Bill had not  ^&apos;&quot;cLw&apos;Lpassed into law in 1911, the chances of it passing the Parliamentaryordeal with  success in 1912 or 1913 would  have been small;  withthe result that a social measure  which its  enemies, as well as itsfriends,  must  admit &quot;is  one  of far-reaching importance  wouldprobably never  have been  passed  at all.  In other  words  thepractical politician has to seize the tide when it serves or may losehis venture.  We admit this truth :  and because we  admit it, weconsider that the Henry VIII clause is a political instrument whichmust  occasionally be used.   But for this reason, we are clear in ouropinion  first that the adoption  of  such a clause ought on  each occasion when it is, on the initiative of the Minister in  charge  ofthe Bill, proposed to Parliament to be justified by him  up to thehilt and that secondly its use should be avoided unless demonstrablyessential. It can only be essential for the limited purpose of bring-ing an  Act  into  operation and it  should  accordingly  be in mostprecise language restricted to those purely machinery arrangementsvitally requisite for  that purpose; and the clause should alwayscontain  a maximum  time limit of one year  after which the powers should lapse.  If in the event the  time limit proves  too short which is unlikely the Government should then come  back to  Par-liament  with a one clause Bill to extend it.  (d)  We reported in paragraph 8  at  page  41 our  objection  to  Judicialthe use  in Acts  of Parliament of clauses purporting to enact  that  d0^tro\ 0,vcrthe mere making of a regulation by  a Minister under the Act  jeg;siation.should be &quot; conclusive evidence &quot; that in doing so he had notexceeded his statutory power.   We are of opinion that in delegatinglegislative functions  to a Minister,  Parliament should be careful to preserve in all but the very exceptional cases, which we describebelow, the jurisdiction of the Courts  of Law  to decide whether inany purported  exercise of those  functions the Minister  has actedwithin the limits of his delegated power.  The rule of law requires that all regulation^ should be open to challenge in the Courts exceptwhen  Parliament  deliberately  comes to the  conclusion  that  it  isessential in the public interest to create an exception and to confer on  a  Minister  the  power  of legislating  with  immunity  from   13307                                                   C  2

We recognise that such exceptions must be created incases where finality is desirable, e.g., where power is given to a minister, to make law upon the faith of which titles  to  propertymay be created or money may be raised, e.g.,  Stock Regulations,or  upon  which marriages may be  solemnized,  e.g., regulations under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1892.&apos;&quot;  But we are of opinionthat  when  for such  reasons  the  regulation  cannot  remain in-definitely  open  to  challenge,  there  should be  an initial period ofchallenge  of  at least  three months and preferably six months.18&apos;Apart from emergency legislation, we hardly think there can be anycase so exceptional in its nature, as  to make it both  politic and justto prohibit the possibility of challenge altogether.   We would direct attention to the fact that procedure by&apos;way ofcertiorari, prohibition and mandamus is  archaic and in  some wayscumbrous and inelastic,  and we would  suggest the expediency of introducing a  simpler,  cheaper  and  more  expeditious procedure.We revert to this topic in Section III of our Report, paragraph 12.   (e) We are  of  opinion that  while the  Rules  Publication Act,1893,&apos;&quot; has worked well within its  sphere of application,  the time has come to repeal it and replace  it  by a simpler  and  more com-prehensive measure  on the lines which we  recommend  in  para-graph 15  below.   (/) We are convinced  that  no system of antecedent publicity,however effective, can relieve the two Houses of Parliament of theduty of exercising an  effective supervision over delegated legislationthemselves.   We are equally convinced that at  the present  time Parliamentary-control over delegated legislation is  defective in two respects :       (i) Legislative  powers are freely  delegated  by  Parliament            without the members of the  two Plouses fully realising            what is being done ;   55 &amp; 56 Viet., c. 23.181 The validity of clearance  orders and compulsory purchase orders, con-      firmed by the Minister of Health under Section 11 of the  Housing      Act, 1930 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5, c. 39), is subject to challenge in the High      Court  within six weeks  after the publication of the notice  of con-      firmation  (subsection 3),  and subsection 4 provides that,  with this      exception, an order 6hall  not, either before or after its confirmation.      be  questioned by &quot; prohibition or certiorari or in any legal proceed-      ings whatsoever  &quot;.  We  believe that this was the  first time, in  an      Act of permanent  application, that  a definite  period of challenge      was allowed. A similar right of challenge within a limited period      was given in the case of  compulsory purchase orders  under  Part  III      of  the Schedule to the Public Works  Facilities  Act, 1930 (20  &amp; 21      Geo. 5, c. 50), and as this was a temporary Act the period was  there      limited to 21 days,  because  the schemes dealt  with were  regarded      as urgent.   56 &amp; 57. Viet., c. 66.
    (ii) although many of the regulations  made  in  pursuance of          those powers are required to be laid before both Houses          and in fact are so laid, there is no automatic machinery          for their effective  scrutiny on behalf of Parliament as a          whole;  and their quantity and complexity  are such that          it is no longer possible to rely for such scrutiny on the          vigilance of private Members acting as individuals.  A          system  dependent on human initiative is liable to break          down, and the best security for the effective working of          any system  is  machinery which  is  automatic  in  its          action.We have, therefore, arrived at  the conclusion that  the time hascome  to establish  in  each House a  Standing  Committee  chargedwith the duty of scrutinising      (i) every Bill, containing any proposal for conferring  legisla-          tive powers on Ministers, as and when it is introduced;    (ii) every regulation, made in the exercise of  such powers and          required to be laid before Parliament, as and when  it          is laid.We desire to make it clear that in no case do we contemplate thatthe Committee should go into the merits of either the Bill  or the regulation.  The sole object of the Committee as conceived by us would be toinform the House in  the  one case of the nature of the legislative powers  which it  was proposed  to delegate  and  of the  generalcharacteristics of the regulation in the other.  In other words  the task of the Committee would  not be to actas critic or censor of the  substantive proposals in either case, butto supply the private Member with knowledge which he lacks atpresent,  and thus enable him  to exercise  an  informed discretionwhether to object or criticise himself.  There would, therefore, be no question in  the case of a regulationof doing the work of the Government Department responsible forthe regulation over again or of rehearing interested parties.  The number  of Bills and regulations which  each  Committeewould  have to  scrutinise in the course of a Session would, nodoubt, be considerable; but  the  preliminary work would be doneby the Clerks of the House attached to  the Committee; and withtheir assistance  and the co-operation of the Government  Depart-ments responsible for, or affected by, the Bills and the regulations and (subject to the consent of the Lord Chairman and the  Speakerrespectively) the skilled advice in  a consultative capacity of Counselto the Lord  Chairman of  Committees for  the  Lords Committee,and Counsel to the Speaker for the  Commons Committee the task of each Committee should not be either burdensome  or difficult.  In regard  to Bills the task of the Committee would be facilitatedif the Bill were accompanied on  presentation  by a  Memorandum   13307                                                   C 3
            by the Minister  or  private Member presenting the Bill in which            he explained the proposals for the delegation of legislative powers            which the Bill contained, and drew attention to their scope, pointing            out whether they were  of  the normal or  exceptional kind,  and            whether the clause was in accordance with precedent  in scope and            language,  and gave  his reasons justifying the proposed delegation.            We regard this point of procedure  as  sufficiently important to be            formulated in Standing Orders.   The  statement of reasons would            involve the  merits of the Bill, and  would be more for the  benefit            of the members  of the  House generally  than of the suggested            Standing Committee.              Except  for such  regulations as required  an affirmative  resolu-            tion  as a  condition  of their  validity, the interposition  of scrutiny            by the Committees  would not  affect the date of the  operation of            a  regulation;  and   for  Bills  and   such regulations  as  required            affirmative resolution  we do not believe  that any serious  delay            would be  entailed.                   Recommendations in regard to delegated legislation.              15. We therefore desire to  make the following  specific  recom-            melidations : Simplified-     I.  The expressions &quot; regulation &quot;  &quot; rule &quot; and &quot; order &quot; shouldtion of no-   not be used  indiscriminately in statutes to describe the instrumentsmenclature.  j^y ^idi  law-making power conferred on Ministers by Parliament            is  exercised.  The  expression &quot; regulation  &quot;ls0 should be used  to            describe the instrument by which the  power to make substantive            law  is exercised, and  the expression  &quot; rule  &quot;  to  describe  the iu-            instrument  by  which the  power to  make law  about   procedure  is            exercised.   The  expression  &quot; order  &quot;  should be used to  describe            the  instrument of  the exercise of  (A)  executive  power,  (B) the            power to take judicial  and quasi-judicial decisions.187&apos;            180 In these recommendations the  words &quot; regulation &quot;&apos; and &quot; rule &quot; are                 so used.            187 We realise  the  natural disinclination  to change  so hallowed  a  name                 as &quot; Order in  Council &quot; :  and we recognise the  propriety  and de-                 sirability of  keeping it for  prerogative Orders in  Council which are                 original and not delegated legislation, but we suggest  that statutory                 Orders in Council  should be known henceforth as &quot; Regulations in                 Council &quot;.                   There is one  exception of principle  which  we favour for reasons of                 convenience.  When a Minister under statutory powers &quot; appoints &quot;                 a day  for an Act  to come  into force, he  does what  is in theory a                 legislative act;  but the word &quot; regulation &quot;  is  inappropriate am!                 we  recognise that to retain  the  word &quot; order &quot;  is  in accordance-                 with common sense.  So when a Minister &quot; confirms &quot; a scheme he may                 appropriately be spoken of as making an order.  But the  distinction                 we seek to draw is obvious  and we need not enlarge further.  There                 are also various cases where the act of a Minister is mainly executive,                 or mainly judicial,  although in analysis it  has a legislative aspect.                  Here again  the word  &quot; order &quot; is appropriate.
164   II.  The precise  limits of the law-making power  which Parlia- Powers ment  intends to confer on a Minister should always be expressly 5&apos;i0U&apos;d oe defined in clear language by the statute  which confers it :  when aefined discretion  is  conferred, its limits  should  be defined with&apos;equal clearness.   III. The use of  the co-called &quot; Henry VIII Clause,&quot; conferring &quot;Henry power on a Minister to modify ithe provisions of Acts of Parliament ];l^/&apos;j^&quot;se&quot; (hitherto limited to such amendments as may appear to him to be Exceptional. necessary  for the purpose  of bringing the statute into operation) should be abandoned in all  but  the  most  exceptional cases,  and should not be permitted by Parliament except upon special grounds stated in the Ministerial  Memorandum  attached  to  the  Bill  (see Recommendation No. XIII);   IV. The &quot; Henry VIII clause&quot; should                        Limits on                                                                 the clause  if     (a) never be used except for the sole purpose of bringing an used.           Act  into operation;     (b) be subject to a time  limit of one  year from the passing           of the Act.   V. The use of clauses designed to exclude the jurisdiction of the exclusion of Courts to enquire into the legality of a regulation or order should Jf^&quot;&quot;^&quot;^ be abandoned in all but the most exceptional cases, and should not Courts be permitted  by Parliament except upon special grounds  stated in should be the Ministerial  Memorandum  attached  to  the  Bill  (see  Recom- exceptional. mendation No. XHI).   VI. Whenever Parliament determines that it is necessary to take Limits on the exceptional  course mentioned in the last recommendation and to ^Ji^ - n confer on a Minister the power to make a regulation  whose validity cxc US10&quot;- is not to be open to challenge in the Courts HBHHMPHHHK&apos;           ^HBRRHflMHMHHP1:     (a) Parliament should state  plainly in  the  statute that  this           is  its intention;     (b) a  period of challenge of at least three months and  prefer-           ably six months should be allowed.188  Apart from emer-           gency legislation, we doubt if there are any cases where           it  would be right to forbid challenge  absolutely.   VII. Except  where immunity from challenge is intentionally The right conferred, there should not be anything iu the  language  of the    courfs&quot;^ statute even  to suggest a  doubt  as to the  right and duty of the Courts of Law to decide in any particular case whether the Minister has acted within the limits of his power. 188 The Housing Act, 1930 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5, c. 39), introduced into Parlia-      ment and passed during the sittings of your Lordship&apos;s Committee,      contains  in Section 11 provisions  which satisfy the requirements and      conditions  recommended by us  above.    13307                                                  C 4

We should like to  see this procedure applied also to Bills pre-sented by  private Members,  but  we express no opinion  on thequestion  whether that course is practicable, and merely submit thepoint for consideration of each House.  XIV.  Standing Orders of both Houses  should require  that  a Proposedsmall Standing Committee should be set up in each House of Parlia-      VJJment at  the beginning of each Session for the purpose of     (A) considering and reporting on every  Bill containing a pro-           posal to confer law-making power  on a Minister :    (B)  considering  and reporting on every regulation and rule           made in the exercise of delegated legislative power, and           laid  before the House in pursuance of statutory  require-           ment.Committeeof eachSouse:suggestionsforprocedure.(A) The procedure in the case of a Bill might be as follows :  Every Bill  containing  any such  proposal  would stand  referredto the Committee as soon as read a first time. The Committee would consider the proposal as soon as possible and would, as  soon  as ithad completed its consideration of  the Bill,  report to the House.It should be the duty of the Committee to consider the  form  only and not  the merits of the Bill and it would report upon its  formand whether it was wholly normal or in any respect exceptional andin particular     (1)  whether  the precise limits of  the power were clearly          defined :    (2)  whether any power to legislate on  any  matter of principle          or to impose a tax was involved in the proposal:191 Section 5S of the Housing Act,  1930 (20 &amp; 21  Geo. 5, c.  39) affords a     good precedent in point of form  for  the type  of provision we con-     template.1B2 e.g.,  a condition of approval by Treasury, what publication, whether     consultative committee, &amp;c.A (Bills).
    (3) whether any power  to  modify the provisions  of  the  Bill          itself or  any  existing  Statute was  involved  in  the          proposal :    (4) whether there was any express proposal to confer immunity          from challenge on any regulation which might  be made-          in exercise of the power and, if so, whether a period of          challengeability was  proposed and,  if so, how long a          period :    (5) whether, if there was no  such  express proposal, there          appeared  to  be any doubt  that  any  such regulation or          rule would be open  to challenge in  the Courts on the          ground that  it was ultra vires:    (6) whether the proposals in fact  contained  in  the Bill were          consistent with and sufficiently explained by the Meni-          memorandum  of the Minister attached  to the Bill:    (7) whether   there   appeared  to  be  anything  otherwise          exceptional about the proposal.  The Beport of the Committee would be printed under standing orders.  Subject to what we say below,  it would not, withouta suspension of Standing Orders, be in order to  move the secondreading of the  Bill, or  at any rate to  open the Committee stage,until the space  of say seven clear days after the Beport of the Com-mittee had  been printed  and circulated to the  House.  The  kindof procedure we have in mind under  revised Standing  Orders isthat the  reception  of  the  Beport of  the  Standing  Committeeshould be a condition  precedent  to further  progress of the  Bill,subject always  to a power in the Lord Chancellor in the Lords endMr. Speaker in the Commons to dispense with  the condition.This  would be necessary in public or other  emergency,  and alsoperhaps for private Members&apos; Bills before the  first two or threeprivate Members&apos; days in a  Session on account&apos; of the  shortnessof  time  available  for preparation.  We fully recognise  the  need of elasticity; we hesitate to offer opinions on  details  of  standing order procedure, and believe that it will suffice if we  indicate the trend of our thought.B (Eegula-    ^ ^-ne procedure for a regulation or rule might be as follows :-tions).        Every regulation or rule  made by a Minister in  the  exercise of           delegated law-making power, and laid before the House in pursu-           ance of statutory  requirement,  would stand referred  to the Corn-           mittee.   It would  be the duty of  the Committee to consider the           regulation  or rule  forthwith, and  to  report to  the House within           fourteen clear days of the day on wrhich the regulation or rule was           laid.
  The Committee would  noi  report on the merits of  the  regula-tion or rule but would report  :      (1)  whether any matter of principle was involved :    (2)  whether the regulation or rule imposed a tax :    (3) whether the  regulation  or  rule  was  (a) permanently           challengeable;  or  (6)  never  challengeable,  i.e.,  un-           challengeable  from the  commencement; or  (c) chal-           lengeable for a specified  period  of time and thereafter           unchallengeable  and, if  so,  what  Was  the  specified           period :    (4) whether it  consisted wholly or partly of consolidation :    (5) whether there was any special feature of the regulation or           rule meriting the attention of  the House :    (6) whether there were any  circumstances connected with the           making  of  the regulation or rule  meriting  such atten-           tion :    (7) whether  the regulation or rule should  be starred, on the           grounds that it  was exceptional, and subjected to the           procedure described below.  The report of the Committee would be laid on the Table of theHouse as soon  as it had been printed.  As  soon as the Report had been tabled, the  regulation or  rule would be brought before  the  House in the Orders of the Day and taken immediately  after Questions under a limit of time  analogous to the present  ten minutes rule.  In  the  case of a starred regu-lation or rule not requiring an affirmative resolution of the Houseany Member would have  the  right to  move a resolution for annul-ment  without  notice.   In the case  of an  unstarred regulation orrule  (not requiring an affirmative  resolution  of the House)  anyMember would have the right  to  give notice of  a resolution  forannulment to be moved immediately after Questions that  day week or immediately before the motion  for  the adjournment  for the recess, whichever should be the  sooner.  For the purpose of enabling it  to  discharge its  functions,  wesuggest that the Committee  should have  at  its  disposal  certainClerks of the House to act as  a permanent  staff and, subject to theconsent of the Lord Chairman and the  Speaker respectively, shouldbe entitled to the assistance in a consultative capacity of  Counselto the Lord  Chairman of Committees, or  Counsel to the Speakeras the  case  may be.

SECTION III.  JUDICIAL OR QUASI-JUDICIAL DECISION.    The supremacy or rule ol law Its history and meaning.  1. The supremacy or rule of the law of  the Land is a recognised  The Rule ofprinciple of  the English Constitution.  The origin of the principle  Law a.must be sought in the theory, universally  held in the Middle Ages,   T1^ c\n.that law of some kind the law either of God or man ought to rule  stitution.the world.&apos;&quot; Bracton, in his famous book on  English law, whichwas written in the first half of the thirteenth century, held thistheory, and deduced from it the proposition that the king and otherrulers were subject to law.1&quot;  He laid it down that the law bound all members of the  state,  whether rulers or subjects; and that justiceaccording to law was due both to ruler and subject.&quot;&apos;5   This view was accepted by  the common lawyers of the fourteenth and fifteenthcenturies and is stated in  the Year Books.  In 1441, in the YearBook 19 Henry YI Pasch.  pi. 1, it is said  : &quot; the law is the highestinheritance  which  the king has;  for  by the  law  he and  all hissubjects are ruled, and if there was no law there would be no king and no inheritance.&quot;  The rise of the power of Parliament in the fourteenth and fifteenth  Historicalcenturies both emphasized and modified this theory of the supremacy  ^f^f^ Qiof the law.  That the rise of the power of Parliament emphasized  ^^princi-the theory  is shown by the practical application  given to it  by  pie.Chief Justice Fortescue in Henry VPs reign.  He used it as thepremise, by means of  which he justified  the control which Parlia-ment had gained over  legislation and taxation.&apos;&quot;   That  the  rise of the power of  Parliament modified  the theory is shown by themanner in  which  the theory  of  the  supremacy of the law  wascombined with the doctrine of  the supremacy of Parliament.  Thelaw was supreme, but Parliament could change and modify it.197  In  some continental countries, notably  in France, this theory ofthe  supremacy  of the law developed into  an assertion  of the supremacy of a  fundamental law, which no  power in the Statecould change and only the lawyers could  interpret.&apos;&quot;  A theory sounpractical ceased to exert much influence when, in the seventeenthcentury,  the  Royal  power  made good  its  claim  to  absolutesovereignty. But, since in England the accepted theory had taken the more practical form of the supremacy of law subject to the1M Holdsworth, Hist. Eng.

            control of Parliament, it prevailed throughout the sixteenth century.            Henry VIII  in  all constitutional questions scrupulously observed            the letter of the law;190 and Bacon in his argument in Calvin&apos;s case            in  1609 could say  that  &quot; law is the great organ by which  the            sovereign power doth move.&quot;200              The  only period  when  this conception of the rule of law was            seriously questioned was in the  Stuart period.   The  Stuart Kings            considered that the Royal prerogative was the  sovereign power in            the State, and so  could override the law whenever they saw fit.            Chief Justice Coke was dismissed from the bench because he asserted            the supremacy of the law.  But his views as to the supremacy of the            law were accepted by Parliament when it passed the Petition of            Bight in 1628, and when it abolished the Court of the Star Chamber            and the jurisdiction of the Privy Council in England in 1641.  Those            views  finally triumphed  as the result of the Great Rebellion, and            the Revolution of 1688. In this, as in other matters, Coke&apos;s writings            passed on the  views of the medieval English lawyers into modern            English law.   But these views were passed on with one  important            addition, which was the result of the rise, in the sixteenth century,           of the modern territorial state.  The law which  was thus supreme           was the law of England ;  and this included the law, written and           unwritten, administered by the  Courts  of  Common Law, by  the           Courts of Equity, by the Court of  &apos; dmiralty,  and by the Ecclesi-           astical Courts.  Thus  the  modern  doctrine of the  rule of law has           come, as the result of this  long historical development, to mean  the           supremacy of  all parts of the law of England,  both enacted and           unenacted.What the     The best exposition  of the modern doctrine and of its corollariesrule of law  js that contained in Dicey&apos;s Law of the  Constitution. He says :201note means.    that  . rule of  law -        .   wnich  forms  a  fundamental           principle of  the  Constitution, has three  meanings, or may be           regarded from three different points of view.  It means, in the first           place,  the absolute supremacy or predominance  of regular law as           opposed to the influence of arbitrary power, and excludes  the exist-           ence of arbitrariness, of  prerogative, or even of wide  discretionary           authority on the part of the  Government   ....  It.means,           again,  equality before the law, or the equal subjection of  all  classes           to  the  ordinary  law of the  land administered by  the ordinary           law courts  ....  The  &apos; rule of law,&apos; lastly, may be used as           a formula  for expressing  the fact that  with us the law  of  the           constitution,  the  rules which  in foreign countries naturally form           part of a constitutional code, are not the source but the consequence           of the rights of individuals as  defined and enforced by  the Courts.&quot;100 Holdsworth,  Hist.

73168  It is primarily from  the first two of these points of view  that we Necessityapproach the problem  propounded by our terms of reference;  but of main-indirectly  Dicey&apos;s  third  point  of  view has a practical importance  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;j7^&apos;at least equal to that of the other  two.  In his book he has demon- &quot;*   0   astrated how the unwritten constitution of England consists of a set of legal principles  gradually  evolved out. of the decisions of  ourCourts of Justice  in individual cases.   Upon the maintenance ofthe principles evolved by  that process  the  liberty of the  subject and the protection of his rights depend.  Any encroachment on thejurisdiction of the Courts,  and any restriction on the subjecfs un-impeded access to  them, are  bound to jeopardise his rights  to amuch greater degree than  would  be  the case in a country  like theUnited States where they  are protected by the express terms of a written constitution ; for by any  such encroachment  the principalsafeguard provided by the  constitution for the  maintenance of thesubjecfs rights is  impaired.   The same process which built up theconstitution may also undermine it.    The difference between judicial and quasi-judicial decisions.  2. The word &quot; quasi &quot;,  when prefixed to  a legal term, generally Meaning of means that the thing, which is  described by  the word, has some  Q&quot;asl -of the legal attributes  denoted and connoted by the legal term, butthat it has not all of them.  For instance, if a  transaction is described as a quasi-contract it  means that the transaction has some of theattributes of a contract but not  all.   Perhaps the best translation of the word &quot; quasi &quot;, as thus used by lawyers, is &quot;  not exactly &quot;.A &quot; quasi-judicial &quot; decision  is  thus one which has some of theattributes of a judicial decision,- but not all.  In order, therefore,to define the term &quot; quasi-judicial decision  &quot;, as it  is used in our terms of reference, we must  discover which of the attributes of a true judicial decision  are included and  which are excluded.  A true judicial decision  presupposes an existing dispute  between Nature oftwo or more parties,  and  then involves four requisites :           true                                                                 judicial   (1) the presentation (not necessarily  orally) of their case by the decisions.parries to the dispute ; (2)  if the dispute between them is a  questionof fact,  the ascertainment of the fact by means of evidence  adducedby  the parties to the dispute and often with the  assistance  of argu-nient by or on behalf of the parties on the evidence; (3) if the dis-pute between them  is a  question of law, the submission  of  legalargument by the parties; and (4) a  decision which disposes of thewhole matter by a finding upon  the facts in dispute and an appli-cation of the law of the land to the facts so  found, including whererequired a  ruling upon any disputed question  of law.  A quasi-judicial decision equally presupposes an existing dispute Nature of between two or more parties and involves  (1) and  (2),  but does Vu&apos;f:not necessarily  involve (3), and never  involves  (4).  The place ^
            of  (4)  is  in  fact taken by administrative action, the character of            which is determined by the Ministers free choice.              For  example, suppose  a statute empowers  a Minister  to  take            action  if certain facts  are proved,  and in that event gives him an            absolute discretion whether or not  he will take action.202  In  such            a case he must consider the representations of the parties and ascer-            tain the  facts to  that extent the  decision  contains a  judicial            element.  But, the  facts once ascertained, his  decision does not            depend on any  legal or statutory direction,  for ex hypothesi he is            left free within his statutory powers to take such administrative203&apos;1            action  as  he  may think fit: that is to say the matter is not finally            disposed of by the process of  (4).  Whereas it is of the essence of            a judicial decision that the  matter is finally  disposed of by that            process and nothing remains to be  done except the execution of the            judgment, a  step which the law of the land compels automatically,            in the case of the quasi-judicial decision the finality of (4) is absent;            another and a different kind of step has to be taken ; the Minister             who for this purpose personifies the whole administrative Depart-            ment of  State has  to make  up his  mind whether he will  or will            not take administrative action and  if so what action.   His ultimate            decision  is   &quot; quasi-judicial &quot;, and  not judicial,  because it is            governed, not by a statutory  direction to him  to apply the law of            the land to the facts and act  accordingly, but by a  statutory per-            mission to use his discretion after  he  has ascertained the facts and            to be guided  by considerations of public policy.  This option would            not be open to him  if he were exercising a purely judicial function.Decisions      It is obvious that if all four of  the above-named requisites to amay be      decision are present, if, for instance, a Minister, having ascertainedtruly        tjie facts, is  obliged by the  statute to decide  solely  in accordance7thoughnot  Witn *ke  &apos;aw&apos;      decision is judicial.   The fact  that it is not given by a   reached by a court so-called, but by a Minister acting under statu-CouH of     tory powers  and under specialised procedure,  will not make theLaw         decision any  the less judicial.              Por  example  the  Unemployment  Insurance Acts,  1920203 to            1930,201 require all &quot; employed persons/&apos;  aged sixteen and upwards,            202 e.g. s. 91 of the Eoad Traffic Act,  1930 (20 &amp;  21 Geo. 5, c. 43), under                 which the Minister of Transport  is directed to consider the report of                 the person appointed by him to hold a public inquiry, the responsibility                 for deciding the question of fact and considering the  arguments of                 the parties being left by the Section upon the Ministers own shoulders.                 See R. v. The Minister of  Transport.  Ex parte Southend Carriers,                 Ltd.  &quot;  The Times,&quot; 18th  December, 1931.            202a Usually the administrative action  imports an  executive decision:  some-                 times it partakes of a legislative character as for instance when the                 Minister makes  an order  &quot; approving  &quot; a  town planning  scheme                  but the distinction for the purposes of this Section of our Report need                 not  be  laboured.            205 10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5; c. 30.             201  20 &amp; 21 Geo.  c. 16.
of either  sex,  whether British subjects  or aliens, to  be insuredagainst  unemployment, unless engaged in  an &quot; excepted employ-ment &quot;  or unless, although  engaged in  an  &quot; insurable employ-ment &quot;, they are  &quot; exempt persons &quot;.  The  Acts  provide that ifany  question arises whether any  employment or class  of employ-ment is such employment as to make the  person engaged thereinan employed person within the meaning of the Act, the questionshall be decided by the Minister of Labour  unless he elects to refer it for decision  to the High Court.  In such a case the decision isclearly judicial  whether it is given by the Minister or by the Court.Neither the Minister nor the Court has any  discretion in the matter.The  question to be decided turns entirely on the application of thelaw  as  laid down  in  the  Acts to  the facts of the  particular case.The  judicial  character of  the  Ministers decision,  when  he gives the decision himself,  is recognised and illustrated by the provision in the  Acts  that  any person aggrieved  by  the  decision of  theMinister may appeal  from that decision to  the High Court and bythe  further provision  that  the Minister  shall have regard to  thedecisions given by  the Umpire by  whom such questions were deter-mined under the earlier  Unemployment Insurance  legislation.2&quot;                        Natural Justice.  3.  In the above analysis we have tried to explain the  essentialcharacteristics of a judicial decision in the full  sense of the phrase;and  we have expressed the view that the quasi-judicial decisionimports only some, and not all, of  those characteristics; or, putting the  same  point in another form,  that the  Minister at some stage in his mental operations before his  action takes final shape passesfrom the judge into the administrator.   But whether the functionbe judicial or quasi-judicial,  its exercise presupposes the existenceof a  dispute and parties to the dispute, and it is this feature whichseparates  the judicial and  quasi-judicial  function on the one handfrom the administrative on the other.  As we have  already pointedout,  a judicial  element is  involved  in quasi-judicial as well  as injudicial  functions;  and it has been truly said that, however much a minister in exercising such  functions may depart  from the  usualforms of legal procedure or from the common law rules  of evidence,he ought  not to depart from or offend against &quot; natural  justice.&quot;That phrase is perhaps more often  used than understood, and wetherefore venture to say what we understand by it.  Before doing so, however, it may  be well to call attention to  two cases Buchanan v.  Rucker&quot;M  and Schibsby v.  Westenholz&apos;07 which  show  that  the conception  of &quot; natural justice &quot;  must beregarded as belonging to the field  of moral and social principles205 Further examples of purely judicial decisions are given in para.  8 on     pages 88 to 90.200 (1807) 1 Camp. 66.2&quot; (1870) L.R. 6  Q.B. 155.
            and not as having passed into the category of substantive law, so            as  necessarily to make every  act  obnoxious to its canons a trans-            progression of  a legal rule  recognised and  enforced as such by  our            Courts.  In  the  former case  Lord  Ellenborough  declared at nisi            prius1&quot; that it was &quot; contrary to  the first principles of reason and            justice that  either in civil or criminal proceedings a man  should be            condemned  before  he  was  heard &quot; and that &quot; the practice of  the            Law Courts of Tobago to summon a defendant who was out of the            jurisdiction and never had been within it  by nailing the writ on the            door of the Court-house was mala  praxis &quot;*&quot;* and could not be sanc-            tioned.  In the latter case these observations were considered by the            Court of King&apos;s  Bench.  The  judgment  of the Court  (Mr. Justice            Blackburn,  Mr. Justice Mellor, Mr. Justice Lush and  Mr. Justice            Hannen) was delivered by Mr.  Justice  Blackburn.   Their Lord-            ships  stated that  &quot; Lord Ellenborough&apos;s expressions were used in            the hurry of nisi prius1&quot; and that when the case came before him            in  banco1&quot; in Buchanan v. Rucker2&quot; he entirely abandoned whatThe de      (with all deference to so great an authority) they  could not regardma nds of    as  more than declamation.&quot;    But although &quot; natural  justice&quot;our nation-  does  not  fall within those   definite  and  well-recognised rulesal sense of   of  law which  English  Courts of Law enforce, we think it is beyondjustice.      doubt that there are certain canons of judicial conduct to which all            tribunals and persons  who have  to  give judicial or quasi-judicial            decisions ought to conform.  The principles on which  they rest are            we think implicit in the rule of law.  Their observance is  demanded            by our national sense of justice; and it is, we think,  the desire to            secure safeguards for their observance,  more than any other factor.            which has inspired the criticisms levelled against the Executive and            against Parliament for entrusting  judicial or quasi-judicial  functions            to  the Executive.First           (i)  The first and most  fundamental principle of natural justice isprinciple of  tlit^fc a man may not be a judge in his own  cause.

But before judgment was pronounced all rulings on points                  of law given by the  Chiet  Justice at  the trial at Nisi  Prius were                 subject to review by himself and the four  other Judges of  the Court.                  sitting  in banco, i.e.,  in Bench or full Court.

In the course of his speech Lord Campbell said :    &quot; No one can suppose  that Lord  Cottenham could  be, in  theremotest degree, influenced by the interest that he had in this con-cern; but, my Lords, it is of the last importance that  the maximthan no man is to be a judge in his own cause should be held sacrod.And that  is not  to be confined to a cause in which he is  a party,but applies to a  cause in which he has an interest.  Since I havehad the honour to  be Chief Justice of the Court of  Queen&apos;s Bench,we have again and again set aside proceedings in inferior tribunalsbecause an individual wrho had  an interest in a cause took a partin the  decision.  And it  will  have a most salutary influence onthese tribunals when it is known that this High Court of last l-esort,in a case in which  the Lord Chancellor of England  had an  interest,considered that  his decision was on that account  a decision notaccording to law,  and was set aside.  This will be a lesson to allinferior tribunals to take care  not oidy that in their decrees theyare not  influenced by  their personal  interest,  but to  avoid  theappearance of labouring under such an influence.&quot;   In that case the Lord Chancellors disqualification was pecuniaryinterest.  It goes  without  saying that  in no  case  in  which  a minister has a pecuniary or any other similar personal interest  ina  decision, e.g.  as the owner whether in his  own right or as  atrustee of  property which may be affected, should he exerciseeither  judicial or  quasi-judicial functions.  Such  cases  may be presumed to be rare, and  we  do not  think it necessary  for us tomake any special recommendations about them.   But  disqualifying interest is  not confined to  pecuniary interest.In Beg.  v. Rand  (1866)  L.B.  1 Q.B.  230 the Court of Queen&apos;bench laid it down that wherever there was a  real likelihood  thatthe judge would, from kindred  or any other cause, have a bias infavour of one of the parties, it would be very wrong in him to act.In Rex.  v. Sunderland Justices (1901) 2 K.B.  357 this  rule wasapplied by  the  Court of Appeal in the  case  of  certain boroughjustices,  who were also members  of the  Borough  Council  andadjudicated in a matter arising out of a proposal which they had
actively supported in the Council, although their pecuniary interest at trustees for the ratepayers was held insufficient in itself to raisethe presumption  of  bias.   &quot; It is hardly necessary to point out,&quot;said the Master of the Rolls, &quot; how very important it is that personswho have to exercise judicial functions with regard to any matter should not lay themselves open to any suggestion of bias on their part.&quot;  Indeed  we think  it is  clear  that  bias from strong and  sincereconviction  as to  public policy may operate as a  more serious dis-qualification than pecuniary  interest.  No  honest  man acting in a judicial capacity allows  himself to  be influenced by  pecuniaryinterest : if anything,  the danger is  likely  to be that  through fearof yielding to motives of  self-interest he may unconsciously do aninjustice to the party with which his pecuniary interest may appearto others to identify him.  But the bias to which a public-spiritedman  is subjected if he adjudicates in any case in  which he  isinterested on public  grounds  is more  subtle and less easy for him  todetect and resist.  We are here considering questions of public policy and from thepublic point of view it is important to remember  that  the principle underlying all the decisions  in regard to disqualification by reasonof bias is  that the mind of the judge ought to be  free to decide on purely judicial grounds and  should not be directly or indirectlyinfluenced  by, or exposed  to the influence of, either motives of self-interest or opinions about policy or  any other considerations not relevant to the issue.  We are of opinion that  in considering the assignment of  judicial functions  to Ministers Parliament should keep clearly in view themaxim that no man is to be judge in a cause in  which he has an interest.   We  think that in  any  case in  which  the  MinistersDepartment would  naturally approach the issue  to be determined with  a desire that  the decision  should go  one  way rather than another, the Minister should be regarded  as having an  interest  inthe cause.   Parliament would do well in such a case to provide thatthe Minister himself  should  not be  the judge, but  that the case should be  decided by an independent tribunal.  It  is unfair to impose  on a  practical administrator the  duty  ofadjudicating in any  matter in which it could fairly be argued thathis impartiality would be in inverse ratio to his strength  and abilityas a  Minister.  An  easy-going and  cynical Minister, rather  boredwith  his office and sceptical  of the value of his Department, would find it far easier to apply a judicial mind to purely judicial problems connected  with  the  Departments administration than  a Ministerwhose head and heart were in his work.   It is for these  reasons and not because we entertain  the  slightest suspicion of the good faith  or the intellectual  honesty of Ministers and  their advisers
171that we are of opinion  that Parliament should be chary of imposingon  Ministers  the  ungrateful  task of giving judicial decisions  inmatters in which their very zeal for the public service can  scarcelyfail to bias them unconsciously.  We desire to make it plain that we are recommending a general principle as  a  future safeguard : we do not wish to imply that theprinciple, though it has perhaps not been clearly  envisaged,  is infact violated in any existing statutes, and we have been unable tofind evidence to support the view held by some critics that it occursextensively.   An interesting example of  the way in which Parlia-ment has observed the principle will be found in  old  age pensionlegislation :  under Sections 7 and 8  of the Old  Age Pensions Act190S21&apos; the Minister of Health is  the central pension authority for determing appeals, although the Commissioners  of Customs and excise, who are responsible to the Treasury, i.e. in practice to theChancellor of  the Exchequer, are the Department responsible forthe administration of pensions.  The  application of the  principle which we have just enunciatedto  quasi-judicial  decision  is  not so easy,  since  a quasi-judicialdecision  ultimately turns upon  administrative policy for which an executive Minister should normally  be  responsible.    We think,however, that  before Parliament entrusts a Minister with the powerand duty of giving quasi-judicial  decisions as part of  a legislativescheme,  Parliament ought  to consider whether the nature of his interest  as Minister in the  carrying out of the  functions  to beentrusted to him by the statute may be such as to disqualify him from acting  with  the  requisite impartiality.   The  comparativeimportance of the issues involved  in the decision will, of course, bea relevant factor.   Where it appears that the policy of the Depart-ment might be  substantially  better  served by a decision one wayrather  than  another,.the first principle of natural justice will  comeinto play, and the Minister should not be called upon to perform theincongruous task  of  dealing  with the judicial part of  the  quasi-judicial decision as an impartial judge,  when ex hypothesi he andhis Department  want the decision to  be  one way  rather  than another.  We recognise that  this kind of case may be  rare,  but itis a real possibility.   In  such a case the judicial  functions  whichmust be performed before  the  ultimate decision is given and onwhich  that  decision must be  based  should be entrusted by Parlia-ment  to an independent  Tribunal whose decision  on any judicialissues  should be binding on the Minister when in  his discretion hecompletes the quasi-judicial decision by  administrative action.   (ii) The second principle of natural justice is one which has two Sec,ondaspects,  both of  which  are  as applicable to quasi-judicial   as  to ^/naturaljudicial decisions.  No party  ought to be condemned unheard; and justice.2&quot; 8 Edw. 7,  o. 40.
soThirdprincipleof naturaljustice.A possiblefourthprinciple.if his right to be heard is to be  a reality, he  must know in good time the case which he has to meet.  But on neither branch  ofthis principle can any particular procedure (i) by which the party isinformed of the  case which he has to  meet, or (ii)  by which  his evidence and  argument are &quot; heard,&quot; be regarded as fundamental.That a  Minister  or a Ministerial Tribunal does not conform to  theprocedure  of  the Courts in either respect imports  no disregard of natural justice.  There is,  for instance, no natural  right  to an oral hearing.   (iii) It may well be argued that there is a third principle of naturaljustice, namely,  that a party is  entitled to know the  reason  forthe decision,  be  it judicial or quasi-judicial.  Our opinion is  thatthere are some cases when the refusal  to give grounds  for a deci-sion may  be  plainly  unfair; and this may  be so,  even when  thedecision is final  and no  further proceedings are open to the dis-appointed  party by way of appeal or otherwise.  But it cannot bedisputed that when further proceedings are  open to a disappointedparty,  it  is contrary to  natural  justice that  the silence of theMinister or tho  Ministerial Tribunal should deprive  him  of  hisopportunity.  And  we  think  it  beyond all doubt that  there  is from the angle of broad political  expediency a real advantage incommunicating the  grounds  of the  decision to the  parties con-cerned  and, if of general interest, to the public.   We deal withthis question  more fully in paragraph 13 of this Section.   (iv) Some judges  have discerned a fourth principle  of  naturaljustice,  which other judges have declined to admit, viz. : that when parliament has provided for what amounts to an oral hearing by themethod of a &quot; public inquiry,&quot; local or otherwise, held before an inspector  appointed  for the purpose by the  Minister, as a  meansof guidance to the Minister in his decision-whether  judicial orquasi-judicial it is contrary to natural  justice  that the  inspectorsreport  upon the  inquiry should not  be  made available to  the  par-ties so heard.  Such  an inquiry is plainly intended by Parliamentto be the  means by  which all the main relevant  facts are to be ascertained,  and  the main arguments of the  parties affected  areto be heard.  Those parties are justly entitled, it  is said,  to know what facts are found by  the inspector and  how he sums up thearguments he has heard, so that they may  know what material is put before the Minister for his decision.  Whether a  refusal  of such publication to  the parties is  contrai-yto natural justice may  possibly be  open to  some  doubt; but it isplain that important considerations of  public policy  are involved,and  we need not pause  to survey the  border land between highpublic policy and natural justice in order to  discover the theoreticalboundary.   We revert  to this question at  greater  length  in para-graph 14 of this&apos; Section.

Decisions which are  purely administrative stand on a wholly  Distinctiondifferent footing from quasi-judicial as well  as from judicial deci-  betweensions  and must be distinguished  accordingly.   Indeed the very  &quot;j.^^1&quot;&quot;word  &quot; decision &quot;  has  a  different  meaning  in the one sphere  of  and judicialactivity and  the other.   When a person  resolves to act 111  a par-  decisions.ticular way,  the mental step may  be described as a &quot; decision.&quot;Again, when  a judge determines an  issue of fact upon conflictingevidence, or  a question of law upon  forensic argument,  he gives a &quot; decision.&quot;  But the two  mental acts differ.  In  the case  ofthe administrative  decision, there is no legal obligation upon theperson charged with the duty  of reaching the decision to consider and weigh submissions and arguments, or to collate any evidence,or to solve any issue.  The grounds upon which he acts, and themeans which he takes  to inform  himself before  acting, are leftentirely to his discretion.  We may illustrate our meaning by twoexamples of such a  &quot; decision  &quot; ; (1) the  decision of the admiralty to place a Departmental  contract  for stores an  act  of  a  purely&quot; business &quot;  character; (2) the  decision of  the Home Secretaryto grant naturalization  to  a particular alien,  a  matter upon which parliament has given him  an absolute discretion.&quot;1&quot;  But even a large  number of administrative decisions may  and do Judicialinvolve,  in greater  or less degree,  at some stage in the procedure ^e&quot;l*&apos;^*li&apos;which eventuates in executive action, certain of the attributes of ^a&apos;&quot;iue&apos;&apos;1&quot;&quot;a  judicial decision. Indeed  generally speaking  a  quasi-judicial decisions.decision is  only  an administrative  decision, some stage  or someelement of which possesses judicial characteristics.  And it is doubt-less because so many administrative acts have this character thatour terms   of  reference  have  specially  included  quasi-judicialdecisions.  The  intermingling  of  the  two  elements  in  one  composite&quot; decision &quot; is well illustrated by the type of case where the judicialelement looms large in proportion to the administrative,  althoughthe final act is administrative.  Instances we have in mind  are thedecisions of licensing authorities constituted under an Act of Parlia-ment with an obligation to grant licences to fit and proper personsin  accordance with the intentions and under the conditions  of theActs ; as for example the Licensing Justices in their annual meetingunder the Licensing Acts, 1910311 and 1921215  :  the Traffic Com-missioners under Part IV  of the Road Traffic Act, 1930,210 ;  or theMinister of  Transport  himself on  appeal from the  Commissionersunder Section 81 of that Act. The ultimate decision is administrative
and not judicial in each case whether given by a justice, a commis-sioner,  or  the Minister.   But  evidence  has to be considered andweighed ; arguments on fact and possibly law have to be heard, and conclusions reached; irrelevant  and improper considerations have tobe excluded;  and  the body hearing  the  application must be dis-interested and free from bias.   And it is only after they have takenall the  above  preliminary steps judicially that they pass into pureadministration and in the  exercise of administrative discretion  on grounds of public policy choose to grant  or withhold  a  licence.2&quot;Decisions by ministers.Decisions bypersonsspeciallyappointedby Mini-ministers.Questionone ofextent andsafeguards.                    Questions to be answered.  5. The second part of our terms of reference  imposes upon us the duty of investigating and reporting upon all judicial and quasi-judicial  decisions  entrusted  by  Parliament either  to  executiveMinisters of the Crown personally or to persons or bodies appointedby a Minister or Ministers to adjudicate either on a special question,or on a  special type  of question, arising  in  the course  of theadministrative work of a Department of State.  Such persons or bodies must necessarily be included in our in-investigation  because there is a possibility that through the right of appointment and re-appointment some degree of control or influencemay be exercised by the Minister, with the result that the &quot; judge &quot;may be in a position of less independence and impartiality than he ought to  occupy.   The language used in our terms of reference  isno  doubt intentionally rather  vague, but we interpret it  as not primarily directed  to those judicial  Tribunals which are recognised as being  in fact wholly  free from  Ministerial influence,  direct or indirect.   In so far  as we discuss them it is  for  the purpose ofdifferentiation, and of  obtaining  light on our proper  subject.   Werefer  to  them hereafter  as &quot; Specialised Courts  of Law &quot;.  The practice of entrusting judicial, as distinct from quasi-judicial,functions to Ministers themselves  has been resorted  to by  Parlia-ment with  comparative infrequency, and at the present time it  iscertainly  exceptional.  On  the other hand Parliament  has  frequently thought fit for various reasons of public policy to entrust judicial functions to bodies or persons  specially appointed  by  Ministers  (to those we refer as&quot; Ministerial Tribunals &quot;) rather than to Courts of Law, whetherordinary  or specialised.  The real questions for us to answer would seem to  be :      (a) To what  extent  should judicial functions  be entrusted            (i) to Ministers and  (ii) to Ministerial Tribunals;     (b) What are  the right methods for the exercise  of such  func-           tions?  What are  the proper safeguards?217 Lord Halsbury&apos;s  exposition of the   duty of justices to exercise  their      discretion to grant or not to grant a licence judicially in Sharp  v.

173Ministers.                   Specialised Courts of Law.  6. There  are on the  Statute Book a  considerable number  ofinstances in which Parliament has excluded certain kinds of justi-appreciable  issues from the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts of Law,and entrusted  them to specialised Courts  which it has establised for the purpose.  Some  of these Courts are not appointed by or on the advice of  DomesticMinisters of the Crown  at  all; and in some cases they exercise a  Courts injurisdiction  which  lies entirely outside  the sphere of the central  cer*a&apos;&quot;-administration of the  State.                                      professions                                                                 notappoint-  Por  example under the Solicitors  Act,  1919,2&apos;8  a  Committee ofthe Law Society known as the Discipline  Committee  has power&quot; after hearing the case &quot; to strike a solicitor off the  Boll of Solici-tors, subject to an appeal to  the High Court of Justice.  Under the Midwives Act, 1902,3&quot; a woman  whose name  is re-moved by the Central Midwives Board from  the roll of midwives isnot allowed to practice  as  a  midwife, though under Section 4 ofthe Act any woman aggrieved by such a decision may appeal within three months to the High  Court of  Justice.  Under the Medical  Act,  1858,220  the General Medical  council has power to erase  the name of any registered medical practitioner,judged by  the Council after  due inquiry to have been guilty  ofinfamous conduct in any professional respect, from the MedicalRegister, which  is the instrument created by Parliament for thepurpose  of  marking  the distinction between  qualified  and un-qualified  medical practitioners. A sentence that a doctor&apos;s name beerased may thus entail deprivation of professional income.   Fromthe Medical Council&apos;s  decision, unlike that of the Discipline Com-mittee of the Law Society and the Midwives Board just mentioned,there is no appeal.  On the other hand  some of these  specialised Courts  appointed  Courtsotherwise than by  Ministers of the Crown have been appointed to  for certaindetermine justiciable  issues arising  between private persons and  gi^f&quot;&quot;^^Departments of State.  For example under Sections 33 and 34 of  notappoint-the Finance (1909-10)  Act, 1910,&quot;1  appeals against Inland Bevenue  ed byvaluation were assigned  to  referees appointed by  the Lord  Chief  Ministers.Justice, the Master of the Rolls and the President of the Surveyors&apos;Institution ;222 while under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of218 9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 56.318 2 Edw. 7, c.  17. .2=0 21 &amp; 22 Viet., c. 90.::l 10 Edw. 7, c. 8.223 or for Scotland and for Northern Ireland by  persons with similar qualifi-     cations.
           Compensation)  Act, 1919,2&quot; any question of disputed compensation           arising out of the compulsory acquisition of land by any Government           Department, or any local or public authority, is determined by the           arbitration of one of a panel of official arbitrators appointed by the           same persons.             It is  clear that none of the above Courts, whether the issues           referred to their determination arise within  or without the sphere           of the central administration of the State, are within our terms of           reference, since they are not appointed by, and are wholly independ-           ent of, Ministers of the Crown.Specialised    There are other specialised Courts which are appointed by  or  onCourts      the recommendation  of Ministers  of  the  Crown  and therefore  dobfPor&apos;onthe ^au Wl*nm our terms of reference.   But several of these Courtsrecommend- are m ^ac^  absolutely independent  of  Ministerial influence, andation of    function as regularly  constituted Courts of Law although exercisingMinisters,   a specialised jurisdiction.             As  we  say elsewhere  in  this report we  regard it as a  sound           presumption  of legislative policy that judicial tasks should be left           to His Majesty&apos;s Judges, and special Courts  constituted by Parlia-           ment only where there are definite reasons of public advantage inThe Mail-   favour  of departure  from the  normal course.   The smallestway and    departure from  it is to compose the  Court of one of His Majesty&apos;sCanal      Judges and  two Commissioners as  is the case to-day with the Rail-Commtsswn. wfty ^ c,mal Commission.             The statutory history of that Court is interesting.             In the early days of railways and  down to the year 1873 the obliga-           tions imposed upon railway companies by various statutes, notably           the Railway and Canal Traffic Act,  1854,524  were enforced by pro-           ceedings in the Court of Common Pleas.  In the year 1873, however,           on  the  passing of a new Railway  and Canal Traffic Act,225 Parlia-           ment thought fit to transfer the jurisdiction of the Court of Common           Pleas in railway matters to a new Court created by the Act, and           consisting of  three  Commissioners, of  whom  one  must  be of           experience in the law, and another of experience in railway business.           In  18S8 this Court was remodelled and its jurisdiction  enlarged by           the Railway and Canal Traffic Act  of  that year.220  The Court is           now a Court of Record, styled the  Railway and Canal Commission,           under the presidency                (a) in England  of one of the  Judges  of  the High Court of                      Justice, assigned by the Lord Chancellor;223 9  &amp; 10 Geo. 5,  c. 57.221 17 &amp; 18 Viet., c. 3i.&apos;225 36 &amp; 37 Viet., c. 48.220 51 &amp; 52 Viet., o. 25.
                                                           -      174    (6) in Scotland of one of the Judges of the Court of Session,           assigned by the Lord President;  and    (c) in Northern Ireland of the Lord Chief Justice.Under the Act of 1888 the other two Commissioners were appointedby the Crown on the recommendation of the President of the Boardof Trade, but the right of appointment has  been transferred to theHome Secretary under Section 2  of the Ministry of Transport Act,1919.&quot;&apos;  The Court deals  with all questions of facilities and prefer-ence,  can conqjel two or more companies  to make mutual arrange-ments for  through  traffic  over their  railways and may determinedisputes  of many kinds between  railway  companies.   There is noappeal from a decision of the Commissioners upon a question of fact;but upon a question  of  law  there is an appeal to the Court ofAppeal.  In  addition to their jurisdiction in  railway matters the Commis-sioners  now exercise  an  important  jurisdiction  under the Mines(Working. Facilities and  Support) Act, 1923,&quot;8 and  the MiningIndustry Act,  1926    see below, paragraph 9, pp. 95-96.  All  the powers of the Commission in respect of rates and charges The Hail-have  now been  transferred to the Bailway  Bates Tribunal, which y&quot;-^1&quot;&quot;^&quot;was established  under the Railways  Act,  1921,and consists of  &apos;&quot; &apos;  &apos;three  permanent members who are &quot; whole-time officers &quot; and are appointed for a term of years with  eligibility for re-appointmentat the end of the term.  They are appointed by His Majesty on therecommendation of the Lord Chancellor, the President of the Boardof Trade, and the Minister of Transport.   One  must  be a person of experience in commercial  affairs,  one a person of experience in railway  business,  and one,  who is the  president,  must  be  an experienced lawyer.  They determine questions of great importancerelating  to the carriage of passengers and merchandise by railway and have almost absolute control over all  the charges a railwaycompany may  legally demand. Many of these are partly questionsof policy, so that the Court  has  administrative as well as judicial functions.  Its  procedure and practice are governed   by  general rules  made by the Court itself  with  the approval of the LordChancellor, the  Lord President of the Court of Session,  and theMinister of Transport.  Its decisions are subject to appeal to theCourt of Appeal, or to the Com-t of  Session, as the case may be,on points of law.  Another well-known Court of  this type  is the Chief Registrar The Reais-of Friendly Societies,  who  must be a barrister of not less  than trar of twelve years standing.   He is appointed by  the Treasury and holds ^e&quot;ff^!&apos;237 9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 50.&quot;s 13  &amp; 14 Geo. 5, c. 20.223 16  &amp; 17 Geo. 5, c. 28.230 11  &amp; 12 Geo. 5, c. 55, s.  20.

Under Section 68 of the Friendly           Societies Act, 1896,231 the parties to a dispute in a registered society           or branch may, by consent (unless the rules of the society or branch           expressly forbid), refer the dispute to the  Chief Registrar,  or in           Scotland or Northern Ireland to an Assistant Registrar, for deter-           mination, subject to the consent of the Treasury.  Such  reference           is a submission to arbitration within the  meaning  of the Arbitra-           tion Act, 1889.232  At  the request  of  either party he may state           a case for the opinion of the High Court of Justice.  Under Sec-           tion 80 he has powers of investigation into the affairs  of societies           and branches, and may award  that  the  society or branch be  dis-           solved.   His powers in such  an investigation  are similar to those           exerciseable by him on reference of a dispute.  The Registrar  also           has  jurisdiction under the Trade Union  Act,  1913,233  as amended           by the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act, 1927,23&apos;&apos; and  under         .  other statutes.  A full list of his powers will be found in the Note           and Memorandum from the Registrar of Friendly Societies, printed           in the first of the companion Volumes to our Beport.  As Industrial           Assurance Commissioner, lie has power to deal with disputes under           the  Industrial Assurance  Act,  1923,235 as  if they were  disputes           referred  to him  under Section  68 of the  Friendly Societies Act,           1896,231 and  the  consent of the Treasury to his  dealing therewith           had been given.The Special    The  Special  Commissioners  of Income  Tax, whose  functionsCommis-    extend over  the  whole country, are a body of whole-time officials,IncomeTac now aPPoillted by the Treasury under the Income Tax Act, 1918,23&quot;           and holding office during their pleasure.  They have an office in           London,  but they also sit elsewhere  as  occasion demands.  They           have appellate jurisdiction in matters relating to income tax  and           sur-tax and  can  be required to state a case for the opinion of the           High Court  on a point of law arising out of an appeal heard by           them.  The Court consists of Crown servants and hears and deter-           mines appeals of great importance in issues  arising between the           Crown and the subject.   An account of the Special Commissioners           will be found in Section IV  of Part IV of the Report (Cmd. 615           of  1920)  of the Royal  Commission on the  Income  Tax, which in           paragraph 359 speaks highly of the public confidence  felt in  this           body of public servants.              This specialised Court is of peculiar interest.  By common  con-           sent it gives general  satisfaction by its impartiality,  in spite of           231 59 &amp; 60 Viet.,  o. 25.           232 52 &amp; 53 Viet., c. 49.           233 2 &amp; 3 Geo. 5, c. 30.           231 17 &amp; 18 Geo. 5, c. 22.           235 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 5, c.  8.           236 8 &amp;  9 Geo. 5,  c. 40,  a Consolidation Act.

All  we can say about it is  that  it is a standing tribute to the fair-mindedness of the British Civil Service;but the precedent is not one which Parliament should copy in other branches of  administration.  Another Court  of  this type is the Board of Referees, who hear The Boardapplications  and appeals by taxpayers on certain matters specified 0&apos; Refereesin the Income Tax  Acts.  They are  appointed  by  the Treasury.The Board, whose  address  is  at  the  Royal  Courts  of  Justice,London, consists of  professional and business  men with  special qualifications for dealing with the matters within their jurisdiction,with a Ring&apos;s  Counsel for Chairman.                     Ministerial Tribunals.  7. There are other specialised Courts of a more informal character,created by Statute, whose members are appointed for the expresspurpose of detei-mining justiciable issues  arising in connection withthe work of a  Government Department,  whether as  Courts  off first  Instance, or as Courts  of Appeal.   We regard our terms ofreference as directed  more  particularly  to Courts  of  this type,although the distinction between them and the specialised Courtsdescribed in the last paragraph is essentially one not of kind but of degree.  For example, under the  Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920&quot;&quot;to 1930,238 a claim for benefit is submitted to an insurance officerappointed by the Minister of Labour.  The insurance  officer mayeither allow  the claim or refer the matter for decision to the Courtof Referees  (which consists of  an equal  number  of representativesof employers and insured contributors and a Chairman appointedby the Minister) or, if he is  of opinion that the  claimants&apos; unem-ployment is  due to a trade dispute, may himself disallow the claim,subject to appeal to  the Court of  Referees.  Elaborate provision is made  for appeals from the  decisions of the  Court of Refereesto the Umpire appointed by His Majesty; the  Umpire&apos;s decision is final.  Under the War Pensions  Act, 1921,210  any  person who is dis- Warsatisfied with a final award under Section 4 of that Act may appeal Pensions.to a Pensions  Appeal Tribunal  appointed by the Lord  Chancellor(or in Scotland by the Lord  President of the Court of Session andin Ireland by the Secretary of State).   The decision of the PensionsAppeal Tribunal is final.
             Under the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos;  and Old  Age Contributory Pen-           sions Act, 1925,211 any person dissatisfied by the award or decision           of the  Minister of Health (or Department of  Health for Scotland           as the  case  may  be) in  respect of  any  pension  may have  the           question referred to  a referee  or referees selected  from a  panel           of barristers  and  solicitors  appointed by the  National  Health           Insurance Joint Committee.  No officer of the Department may           be a member of the panel.   The decision of the referee or referees           is final and  conclusive,  except that they  may  state a case on  a           point of law for  the High Court  (or  in  Scotland the Court of           Session) or  in  either case the Court -may  order them  to do so.3&quot;              Judicial and quasi-judicial decisions by Ministers themselves.             8. From  the  judicial  powers of  Ministerial Tribunals we pass           straight to examples  of the judicial and quasi-judicial  powers con-           ferred  by Parliament on Ministers themselves.             We have already ixiinted out  in paragraph 2 that a quasi-judicial           decision differs from  a judicial decision in  that it is governed, not           by a statutory direction  to the Minister to apply  the law of the           land to the  facts and act accordingly, but  by  a  statutory direction           or permission to use his administrative discretion and to be guided           by considerations of public policy after he has  ascertained the facts           and, it may  be, the bearing of the law on  the facts so ascertained.Examples of   As already stated, the entrusting of judicial decisions to Ministersjudicial     themselves  is  rare  in existing statutes.   An  example  will beMinisters^&apos;  founCl  iu  Section  268 of the Public  Health Act, 1875.2&quot;   Under           this  section,  any  person who deems  himself  aggrieved by the           decision of  the Local Authority in  any case  in which the  Local           Authority are  empowered to recover in a summary  manner any           expenses  incurred  by them, or  to declare such expenses  to be           private improvement  expenses, may  address a  memorial  to the           Minister of  Health,  stating the grounds of his complaint.    The           memorialist  must at the time  deliver a copy of the  memorial  to           the Local Authority.  The  Minister is then  empowered to make           such order in the matter as  to him may  seem  equitable, and the           order so made shall be binding and conclusive on all parties.              In  Reg.  v.  Local  Government  Board, (1882) 10  Q.B.D. 309           Brett  L.J.  after expressing  the  opinion that the  decision  of the           Local  Government Board, to whom the appeal under  Section 2CS           originally lay,  was a judicial decision said : -                  &quot; The Local Government Board have power to inquire into                every circumstance,  however remote,  which could reasonably                determine  the  question whether  it  was inequitable  or not              15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5,  c. 70.           212 Further illustrations of tribunals of this class will be found in Annex IV.            213 38  &amp; 39 Viet, c. 55.Hontribu-tory l&apos;en-sions.
    that  a  particular sum  should be paid.   If that be so, they do    not inquire into  former matters  as decisions  of the  Local    Authority,  but  they  inquire into  them as facts in order to    enable  them to determine  upon the largest interpretation of    the word &quot; equitable  &quot;  that can be given to it, whether the    particular sum  is one which it is equitable, fair  and right that    the individual  should  be forced by the  Legislature to pay for    works  which have been  done against his  will; and therefore    I should be loth to the extremest degree to fetter  the  power    of the  Local  Government  Board  to inquire into every fact    which  could reasonably lead them  to a  fair and equitable con-    clusion with regard  to  that question  which is the question    before  them.&quot;  Under Section 139 of  the Law of  Property  Act, 1922,244 thecompensation for extinguishment of manorial rights  is to be ascer-tained in  accordance with  a  statutory  scale, and the  scale  isbinding as  a matter of law in all cases, unless on application  beingmade to the Minister  of. Agriculture  and  Fisheries on the  parteither of the  lord of the manor or the  tenant the Minister decidesthat owing to any special  custom  or other exceptional circum-stances the application of  the scale would work injustice to either party, and if the  Minister  so  decides,  the Minister may,  if he thinks fit,  vary the scale, or fix some other  scale which shall be applicable to the case.  In  this instance  it is plain that the Ministers functions are asstrictly judicial as  any function can  possibly be.  The sole con-siderations  by  which  he is  entitled to  be  influenced  in arriving at a  decision  are  considerations of justice between the  parties.No question  of policy arises  and no considerations  of policy mustinfluence him.   The duty imposed upon him  by the section  is theduty of acting  strictly as  a judge.  Under Section 89 of the National Health  Insurance Act, 1924,245the determination  of  several important questions is entrusted tothe Minister of Health, e.g., whether any  employment is employ-inent within the meaning of the Act.   This again is  on the face of  it a  strictly  judicial  power.   If  a  hearing  is  necessary, theMinister appoints  a member of the legal staff of the Departmentwho is either a barrister or a solicitor to hear the persons interested and to report  to him thereon.  It  is  customary to give  at leastseven days&apos; public  notice  of the date and place fixed for the hear-ing.  Counsel  may be heai-d.   The Ministers  decision is  drawn:&quot; 12 &amp; 13 Geo. 5, c. 16.-,s 14 and 15 Geo. 5, c.  38.  For a detailed description  of these decisions     the reader is referred to the &quot; Memorandum on  powers conferred on     the Minister of Health of a judicial or quasi-judicial nature,&quot; (Second     companion volume, 9th day evidence).
           up in the form of a memorandum which is communicated  to the           persons interested; but no express obligation is laid upon him  to           give  reasons.   There  is  an  appeal on  any question of law to a           Judge  of the High  Court selected  for  the purpose by  the Lord           Chancellor, whose decision is final.   The Minister may, if he thinks           fit, submit the question for decision to the High  Court in the first           instance; and  if he does so, the decision of that  Court is again           final.  On any appeal  from  his decision the Minister is entitled  to           appear  and to be heard.             Sub-section  (2) of  Section 29 of the  Education Act,  1921,           imposes on a  local  education authority  the duty  of maintaining           and  keeping efficient  a public elementai-y school not provided  by           them only so long as  it is necessary  and the statutory conditions           and  provisions are complied with.   In Board  of Education  v.           Rice-&quot;  the Managers of the Oxford  Street voluntary  school  at           Swansea claimed that the local  education authority had failed  to           discharge its statutory duty under the  corresponding section  of           the Education Act, 1902,&quot;&quot; which  is repealed and replaced  by the           Act of  1921.   Under Sub-section  (3) of Section 7 of  the Act of 1902           the question fell to be determined by the  Board of Education,  as           a like  question now  falls under sub-section (9)  of Section 29  of           the Act of 1921.  In  that case the House of Lords, affirming the           decision of the Court  of Appeal, who had  affirmed  the decision of           the Divisional Court,  held that the Board  had  not  determined the           question, though they  had purported to do so, and that a mandamus           must issue commanding them  to  determine  it.   Lord  Justice           Parwell lays  it down  in his judgment in  the  Court of Appeal,2&quot;           that under the sub-section in question the Board act in a judicial           capacity and are bound  to obey  the law and act according to the           ordinary rules of evidence;  they  can neither dispense with  the           requirements of the Act nor assume knowledge of  particular facts           not proved before them.Examples of   Examples of quasi-judicial decision are easily found.   UnderQuasi-      Section  69,  sub-sections  (2) and (3),  of the Housing,  TowndecTsiols by Planning. etc., Act, 1909rsl the medical officer of health of a districtMinisters.   must give to the medical officer of health of the county any informa-           tion which it is in his power to give and which the medical officer of           health  of the county may  reasonably require from him for  the           purpose of his duties prescribed by the Minister of Health.  If any           dispute or difference arises between the two  medical officers under           this section, it stands referred  to the Minister of  Health,  whose217 11  and 12 Geo. 5, c. 51.218 [1909] 2  K.B.  1045; [1910] 2 K.B. 165; [1911] A.C. 179.240 2 Edw. 7, c. 42.250 [1910] 2  K.B.  at p. 178.251 9 Edw. 7, c. 44; these sub-sections have not been repealed.
&quot;: 11 and 12 Geo. 5, c.  51.:&quot; In practice the President thereof.decision is final and binding.   This is a perfect example of a quasi-judicial decision.  It is the duty of the Minister to give both medical officers an opportunity to  present their case to him orally or not,as he thinks fit.  It is his duty to ascertain the facts out of which! he  dispute arises by means of evidence adduced by the parties.The facts thus ascertained  and  the  arguments of  the  disputantsduly mai-shalled,  it then  becomes his duty to decide whether therequirements  of the county officer are reasonable or not a decision which can  only be reached after considerations of  medical policyin local administration have been taken into account.  In the end the  Minister makes up his mind  what is best to do, and does it.  Under Section 19 of the  Education  Act, 1921,232 it  is the dutyof the Board  of Education to determine in case of dispute whethera school is necessary or not.   The  section provides that in  sodetermining the Board shall have regard to the interest of secularinstruction, to  the  wishes of  parents  as to the education of their children, and to the economy of the rates.  All these are considera-tions of policy and  the dispute cannot be determined without care-fully weighing  one against the others.  Local Authority, parents,ratepayers must all have an opportunity of presenting their case and of adducing evidence under  each  of the three heads.   All thefacts  must be ascertained,  everybody&apos;s point of  view must  bejudicially weighed,  and care must be taken to do equal justice  tothe  demands of education,  parental  convenience,  sympathies andeven prejudices, and not least and yet not most to the mundaneclaims of local finance.  But  when all  this has  been done, thequestion remains in ultimate analysis a question of policy and nota question of law ;  although  it is difficult to imagine any question whether  of law or of policy more  essentially  requiring  a wellbalanced and in that sense a judicial mind.  The  Board of Education233 may appoint a person or persons  tohold a public inquiry in  the  neighbourhood of the school for thepurpose of hearing,  receiving and examining any evidence and information offered, and hearing and inquiring into the objectionsor representations  made  respecting  the necessity  of  the school.The person or persons so appointed  must make a report  to theBoard  in writing, setting forth the result of the inquiry and theobjections and representations, if any, made thereat and any opinionor recommendations submitted by him or them to  the Board.  TheBoard  must furnish  a copy  of  the report  to  any  local  educationauthority  concerned  with the question  of  the  necessity of theschool,  and,  on  payment of such fee as may  be fixed  by the
           Board, to any person interested.&quot;&apos;   But in the end it is the Board           of Education in London which  has to decide  whether the school           is necessary or  not.&quot;3             Under the Housing Act, 1925,&quot;&apos; a Local Authority had power           to make a scheme for the improvement of an unhealthy area.  After           the improvement  scheme had been prepared  and  advertised and           notices had been served on persons whose lands were proposed  to           be taken  cornpulsorily  for the purpose of the scheme, the Local           Authority presented a petition to  the Minister praying that an order           might be  made confirming the scheme.  That the judicial  element           entered into the  functions of the Minister upon receipt of the           petition is shown  by the requirement of the Act that the  petition           should state the names of any owners or reputed owners, or lessees           or reputed lessees, who had dissented  in  respect of the taking  of           their  lands, and by the further requirement that the petition should           be supported by such evidence as the Minister  might from time  to           time  require.   It  was the duty of the Minister  to consider the           petition and to determine whether to confirm  the  scheme or not.           Before confirming a scheme he caused a  local inquiry to be held.           Upon receipt  of the  report of  the inquiry  the Minister had  to           consider  whether  or not he was satisfied that the circumstances           were  such as to justify the making of the scheme and that the           carrying  into effect  of the scheme either  absolutely,  or  subject  to           conditions or modifications,  would be beneficial to the health  of           the inhabitants of  the  area  in  question  or of the  neighbouring           dwelling-houses.   If he  was so satisfied, but not  otherwise,  he           might by order confirm the scheme with or without such  conditions           or modifications.  If he made the  order, it had effect as if enacted           in the Act.  It is clear that the Minister was bound to give full           weight to the views of the dissentient landowners  and that he was           not entitled to make  an order unless after considering the report           of the inquiry  in a  judicial spirit he was  satisfied  that the scheme           was such a scheme as  the Act  empowered him  to confirm.  But           that  done, he had a discretion whether to make the order or not,           and in making the order he was exercising a legislative function.2&quot;                                    Some principles.Judicial      9.

178an executive Department  should  be entrusted with its  execution ;but if the measure is one  in which justiciable issues will be raised in the course of carrying the Act into effect, and truly judicial deter-mination will be  needed in order to reach decisions, then prima facie that part of the  task should be separated from the rest, and reserved  for decision  by  a  Court  of  Law whether ordinary  orspecialised,  as in  the  circumstances Parliament  may think right.  It is only on special  grounds  that judicial functions should  be assigned by  Parliament to  Ministers or Ministerial Tribunals.  Thatthere  may  be occasions where Parliament  may  rightly think  thepublic interest best served by such assignment, we readily recognise ;but Parliament when  so deciding should  still remember that sucha  legislative provision   is  exceptional   in  character howevernumerous the individual cases may seem likely  to  be  under  theparticular legislative scheme which gives rise to  them.   And thisobservation  remains none  the  less true although  in modern sociallegislation it may often  be wise for Parliament to take  the excep-tional course; but to  prevent  misapprehension we add here  thatwe distinguish between Ministers  and Ministerial Tribunals, as willbe seen in paragraph 10  below  where we revert to  the topic.  But quasi-judicial decisions  stand on a different footing.   The  Quasi.presumption as to the correct  legislative course is the other way ;  judicialfor a decision which ultimately  turns on administrative policy should  decisions.normally  be  taken by the executive Minister.  It is true  that for the purpose  of enabling a Minister to give aquasi-judicial decision it  is frequently necessary for a public inquiry to be  held as, for example by  an inspector of the Ministry ofHealth under the  Housing Acts, 1925&quot;8 and  1930,259 or by  an inspector of  the Ministry of Transport under the Koad Traffic Act,19302&apos;0 and that such an  inquiry is to some extent judicial.   Butthe  inquiry  does not  finally  determine the rights of  the partiesaffected; it is merely a first stage.   The rights are determined at thesecond stage by  the exercise of the Minister&apos;s discretion.   He  hasto make  up his  own  mind, after considering the report on  the inquiry, about  the appropriate action to be  taken for example,whether to confirm a clearance  order or not,261 or whether to modify the  restrictions on the use of  a road by public service vehicles ornot.262  In reaching a  decision he must, of  course, be actuated  bythe  elementary principles  of reason and justice; none the  less his decision is not judicial but administrative.:5S 15 &amp; 10 Geo.  5, c. 14.  20 &amp; 21 Geo.  5. c. 39.:60 20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5, c. 43.:&quot; See s.  2 and the  First Schedule  of the Housing Act,  1930  (20 &amp; 21     Geo.  5, c.  39).:&quot; See s. 91 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5, c. 43).13307
               The  person holding the  public  inquiry never  takes the  fihai            decision.  Tie must be competent and impartial ;2&quot; he must examin            the evidence and the information offered, and he must do so criti. -            ally  and  dispassionately;  he  must  listen to representations and            weigh objections; he may  have to hear counsel;  he must duly and            faithfully report; and he may  submit recommendations and tender            advice :204 but when  he has done all this, his task is  done,  and the            final decision has to be taken  by the responsible Minister  himself.            Whilst this is the  general position under  present  practice, we            think that Parliament would be well advised to  bear in mind the            suggestion which we have already made in  paragraph 3, that where            in any legislative scheme  it  appears likely that in  the course of            its administration important  issues will  be  raised  calling  for a            judicial decision  before the  Minister takes his final decision and            that the interest of  the Department will  be such  as to disqualify            the Minister  from giving  the  judicial  decision,  the  statute should            itself provide for the segregation of judicial issues  and their deter-            mination  by  an  independent Ministerial  Tribunal as a condition            precedent to action by the Minister.Judicial       Just as some  elements of the judicial function  may thus enterdecisions     into  activities which are mainly administrative, so  where the prob-involying    \em js m essence  or predominatingly judicial i.e., not merely quasi-&quot;tve action&quot;  judicial there may be executive or  legislative elements involved inor subor di-   the performance of  the particular judicial task,  or so inseparablynate legis-   connected with it, that Parliament in working  out its  statutory planlatwn.      wjjj  have to choose between (1) splitting the problem into two so            as to leave  the judicial  side to a Court, whilst entrusting the  non-            judicial side to the Minister whose Department  is concerned, and            (2) assigning certain limited functions of an executive or legislative            order to the Court charged with the judicial decision.Impossibil-     That such things should be  done by Parliament need  not  shockity of rigid  the most rigid constitutional purist.   The doctrine of  the  separationot^owers&quot;   0l? P0^^1&quot;8 is no^  sacrosanct.

179sufficient  certainty  its  three  great  provinces,  the  legislative,executive  and judiciary.&quot;  The separation of  powers is  merely a rule of political  wisdom, and  must give way where sound reasons of public  policy  so  require.   Where  a  problem has a stronglymarked judicial  side, but it is difficult to detach the non-judicialside be  it administrative or  be it legislative Parliament may insome  cases be well advised to  entrust the whole to a Court of Law.If the particular  task is not suited to the ordinary Courts of Law,it may properly  be  assigned to some special  tribunal already exist-ing, or to be newly-created for the purpose, which is better adaptedin personnel or procedure.   A concrete illustration will help to make  our meaning clear.  The  Grant of mines Department  of the Board  of Trade has,  broadly  speaking,  &quot;f^&quot;11^&apos;&quot;^under statutory   provisions  the  administrative duty of  promoting  tl0 ea Vp&quot; ce*a\the well-being of the mining industry of the country.  One obstacle  Court.in the way of progress  used to be the  difficulty encountered  inobtaining the right  to work  minerals  held  in private ownership,when the owner demanded unreasonable terms.  Parliament mighthave  delegated powers of individual legislation,  in the  nature  of compulsory acquisition of land, to the Mines Department,  and leftto that Department the administrative work connected with carry-ing out such si policy.  But it  was obvious that the task of weighingup the l-ights of the proprietor,  the needs of the  mine-worker andthe claims of the nation, as well as of settling the particular terms which would be fair, called not only for the exercise of impartialjudgment, but also for the investigation of evidence and  the ascer-tainment of complicated legal  rights.  It was reasonable,  therefore,for Parliament by the Mines (Working Facilities and Support)  Act,1923,2&quot; to assign to a Court the  function of deciding on each appli-cation the issue whether it was in  the national interest that privaterights should be  so over-ridden, and if so on what terms of compen-sation.  But over and above these functions, some of which were purelyjudicial, there were the non-judicial functions of forcibly expropriating-priating certain  proprietors, and  of framing  principles  of public policy regarding  the  nation&apos;s interest  in the exploitation of itsmineral resources to the best  economic  advantage,  and in themaintenance  of  employment.   Parliament might have  taken theview that  these questions of public policy wei-e the proper businessof the Mines Department.  It did not, however, take that view and assigned the  whole task to the  Railway and Canal CommissionCourt, giving almost nominal duties to the Mines Department.  Asa result that Court has had to inquire into and form its own opinionon many questions of public policy, and its orders have a tripartitecharacter, being legislative and  administrative as well as judicial.:&quot; 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 5, c. 20.   13307
And the constitutional experiment has by common consent worked well; indeed so well that in 1926  Parliament extended  the  scopeof the Courfs powers very widely.  The  Eailway Pates Tribunal  constituted  under  the  railways act, 1921,201 and described above in  paragraph 6, is another instanceof the allocation by Parliament to  a special Court of issues whichare  largely administrative, on the ground that they call  for  theexercise of  high judicial qualities in balancing the claims of com-competing interests, in  considering evidence and in  appreciating legalprinciples.Circum-stances mayjustify thearant ofjudicialpowers to ministers orMinisterialTribunals.Such cases should beregarded asexceptional.                    Purely Judicial decisions.  10. We quote these instances of the intentional refusal of Parlia-ment to be trammelled by any theoretical rule about the sepai-ationof powers, in  order to make good our point that well consideredreasons of practical convenience  based on  experience  may  justifythe converse  case  of  the statutory  grant of judicial  powers  to ministers and Ministerial Tribunals.    Whether  they do or  notcannot  be answered by any  a priori rule.   The decision of Parlia-ment must be reached in each individual piece of legislation,  basedon  a  consideration  of  all  the  circumstances of  the particularlegislative plan before it.  It is therefore clear that question  (a) in paragraph 5  (viz.. towhat extent judicial functions  should  be entrusted  to Ministers orto Ministerial  Tribunals) cannot be  answered by any general prin-ciple or formula enunciated in advance  and to be applied  in allcases, except that Parliament should always be extremely  relue-tant to entrust either Ministers or Ministerial Tribunals with purelyjudicial powers.  In the  rare  cases where  that course has  to beconsidered, the decision of Parliament should normally depend on what is the dominant aspect of the  problem or class of problem to  be solved.   It  may on very exceptional  grounds  be necessaryto  leave certain judicial  decisions to a Minister or other adminis-trative authority.     An  illustration  is afforded  by  the powersentrusted to  the Insurance Commissioners  in Sections 66 and 67of  the  National Insurance  Act,  1911.268  It was anticipated  thata very  large number of questions would arise within a short  periodnear the  time of coming into operation  of the Act  and it was  con-sidered essential to the efficiency and smooth working of the scheme that  decisions should be given promptly, and on a consistent  plan for the whole country, without involving either elaborate machineryor  great  expense.   Had  the control of the whole matter not been left in  the hands of the administrative authority, there might havebeen considerable risk  of a breakdown by reason of the failure   11  &amp; 12  Geo. 5, c. 55.208 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c. 55.

TribunalsBut, prima facie, it is no part of an executive Ministers functions Pr,,fcraoJe-to  act as a judge; and it is plain  that as a general rale  there  willbe  little difficulty in providing for  judicial decisions being entrusted to  a Ministerial Tribunal instead of to the  Minister  personally,on  the lines of Section 91 of the  National Health Insurance Act,1924.2&quot;5  We  recognise  that  such  Ministerial Tribunals have  much to Theirrecommend  them.  In cases where justice can only be done  if advantages.it  is done at  a  minimum cost, such Tribunals, which  are likelyto  be cheaper to the  parties, may on this ground be  preferred tothe ordinary  Courts  of law.    In addition  they may  be more readily accessible, freer  from technicality, and where relief mustbe  given quickly more  expeditious.   They  possess  the requisiteexpert  knowledge  of  their subject a specialised Court may often be  better for the exercise of a special jurisdiction.  Such Tribunalsmay also be better able at least than  the inferior Courts of law to  establish  uniformity of practice.  But  while we  recognise these  advantages we repeat  that suchTribunals should be set up only in those  cases in which the con-ditions beyond all question  demand  it.   It  is  in  the ordinaryCourts, higher or inferior, that justiciable  issues, whether betweensubject and  subject or between Crown and subject, ought as a  ruleto  be determined.  Our  question  (b) in paragraph  5,  viz.   (&quot; What  are the rightmethods  for the exercise of  such  functions? &quot;),  raises the  whole problem  of  safeguards,  with which we deal below-;  but we maysay at  once  that on the  judicial side of our enquiry we have cometo  the  same conclusion  as on the delegated legislation  side, viz.,that  there is nothing  radically  wrong  about the  existing practiceof Parliament, but that the system is capable of abuse, that dangersare incidental to it if not guarded against, and that certain safe-guards are essential if the rule of law and  the liberty of the subjectare to  be maintained.                   The necessary safeguards, 11. We have already expressed the opinion in paragraph 9 thatquasi-judicial functions should normally be exercised by ministers themselves.   On the other hand, w-e have recommended that purelyjudicial functions  should normally be  left to  Courts of Law  andthat  they should  only be exercised  by  Ministers or  MinisterialTribunals in exceptional cases.   Where  either judicial or  quasi-judicial functions  are exercised  by Ministers,  or judicial  functions

The supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice.  12. We do not think any will dispute that the jurisdiction of theHigh Court of Justice to quash the proceedings of inferior courts isimportant, and that its exercise is wholesome.  That the jurisdictionshould be no less vigilantly exercised in the case of a Minister or a ministerial Tribunal than in the case of Courts of Law is clear.  The scope of the High Court&apos;s supervision is well established bylaw.  If a properly constituted inferior tribunal  has exercised thejurisdiction   entrusted  to  it  in  good  faith,  not  influenced byextraneous  or  irrelevant  considerations,  and not  arbitrarily  orillegally, the High Court cannot interfere.   When  exercising itssupervisory  powers the  High  Court is not sitting  as a  Court  ofAppeal from the Tribunal, but it has power to prevent the usurpa-tion or mistaken assumption by the Tribunal of a jurisdiction beyond that given to it by law, and to ensure that its decisions are judicialin character by compelling it  to avoid  extraneous considerations in arriving at  its conclusion, and  to confine  itself to decision of thepoints  which  are  in  issue before  it.  Likewise  a  Minister  orMinisterial  Tribunal  is  not autocratic  but is an inferior tribunalsubject to the jurisdiction  which the  Court  of King&apos;s Bench for
181centuries, and the High Court since the Judicature Acts, has exer-cised over such tribunals.270  That the jurisdiction extends to quasi-judicial, as well as to judicial functions, was expressly decided bythe House of Lords  in Minister of Health  v.  The King (on the prosecution of Yaffe)  [1931]  A.C. 494.  We regard as essential the maintenance of this jurisdiction, anda simple and  cheap access to the High Court in order to invoke it.  The  existing procedure  is in our opinion already  expressed in simplification-Section II too expensive and in certain respects archaic,  cumbrous tion ofand too inelastic.   We therefore desire to repeat, and to apply in procedureour present context,  the recommendation which we have made jnthat Section  in  favour of  the  establishment  of a simpler and lessexpensive procedure and one more suited to the needs of the modernage.     Vigilant observance of the principles of natural justice.  13. It goes without saying that it is the duty of every Minister Procedureor Ministerial Tribunal, to  whom the function  of adjudication is &apos;^eclJl0t, heassigned, to act judicially and to come  to decisions in the spirit and     l^af Qjwith the sense of responsibility of a tribunal whose task it is to mete jMW Courts.out justice.  But it does not  follow that the procedure of every suchtribunal must be the  same.   In the case of a Court of  Law the lawitself prescribes certain rules to which the procedure must conform.In the case of a Minister or Ministerial  Tribunal, so long as  theprinciples of  natural justice  are observed,  a certain  degree  ofelasticity may be not only necessary but desirable.  We,  therefore,  recommend  the  observance  of the  followingrules :   (a) In future  legislation  Parliament  should  proceed  on  the &quot;j&quot;^^1?/principle that no Minister (in which word we include any officer of   11 eres &apos;a Minister  acting under his  orders) should give a  judicial  decision in any dispute in which the  Minister has the kind of Departmentalinterest described in  paragraph 3.  If such  cases  appear likely to arise, Parliament should provide for determination of the disputeby a Ministerial Tribunal functioning independently of the Minister.  In any case in which it appears probable that a Minister may be disqualified by an interest of this kind  from discharging impartiallythe judicial  functions involved in a quasi-judicial decision, Parlia-ment should entrust  those functions to a Ministerial Tribunal thatthey may thus be  discharged  independently of the Minister as acondition precedent to his ultimate administrative decision.  (b) Each  of the  parties to a  dispute should be given the oppor- rhe rightstunity  of stating its  case not  necessarily orally and should also of the___^_ parties.-7a See  the judgment of Lord  Justice Farwell  in !R. v. Board of Educa-     tion, [1910] 2 K.B.  165 at 179.
            be given the opportunity of knowing the case which it has to meet            and of answering that case if it can.&apos;&quot;&apos;Itcasoned      (c)      Pal&apos;ty  affected  by a decision should be  informed of thedecisions to  reasons on which the decision is  based ; indeed it is generally desir-be given.     able  that the  fullest amount of  information compatible  with the            public interest should be given.              (d)  Such  a  decision  should  be  in  the  form of a  reasoned            document available to the parties affected.   This document should            state the  conclusions as to the facts and as to any  points of law            which have  emerged.              Where  the  decision  has been preceded  by  a  statutory public-            inquiry,  if the Minister  modifies the recommendations  or rejects            the findings of fact in the inspector^ report, it is especially irnpor-            tant that his decision should draw attention to  his reasons for so            doing.              The Ministry of Health have  made  considerable strides in  this            direction and specimens of letters conveying decisions  will be found            in  the second  of the companion volumes to our Report  (Eleventh            Day  Evidence).  We  are of opinion that  where the decision is            quasi-judicial the present practice of conveying it in  the  form of a            letter is  quite suitable; but a purely judicial  decision  should always            be embodied and notified  to  the parties in the  form of a  legal            judgment.              The publication for general guidance, by the Ministry concerned,            of  leading cases is  also  to be  commended subject  to reasonable-            regard to considerations of expense, and here again  the practice            of  the  Ministry  of  Health  is  recommended to  the attention of            other Departments with similar  duties.              Where  the  Ministers  ultimate decision  is based  solely on his            views of  public  policy, we recognise  that  the  notification  may            properly  be  limited, so far as the ultimate decision is concerned.            to  a statement to that effect,  but, so far as judicial elements are            involved in the decision, the views we have  already expressed about            judicial   decisions  and  the  reasoned  notification  of  them  are            applicable.

182  In particular  we heard evidence from  different  angles on  thesubject of decisions taken by the Minister of Health after publiclocal inquiries under the Town Planning Act, 1925,273 and similarActs.  We are aware that it is  proposed in the  Town and country planning Bill now before Parliament to repeal the Act of  1925,but the procedure is now more or less standardised, and the  refer-ence to that Act will serve our purpose.  That Act confers on  the  Minister of Health wide  powers of  procedureauthorising the appropriation or restriction of user of  the subjects  of ln-private property.  When a town planning scheme  is propounded,  spectors.it is the practice of the Minister  of Health to instruct an inspectorto hold  a local  inquiry.   The  inspector fixes a hearing in  the locality, when an  opportunity  is given to all interested parties toput their views  and their evidence before him  and the witnessescalled on either  side may be and often  are cross-examined by theother  side.  In  addition the inspector  gathers information fromother sources.  The inspector  then makes his report to the Minister in the formof a confidential document;  the report  is then considered  in  theDepartment  from the  legal, financial,  administrative and  other aspects and the  decision is finally taken by  the Minister on con-sideration of all the relevant data, of which  the facts reported bythe inspector form only one part.  The inspectors report itselfmay be partly fact and partly opinion.  Various criticisms have been made  before us on this  system.  It has  been  alleged  that  the inspector does  not  always  actjudicially, but that he supplements his formal inquiry by personalinvestigation, and that it is  improper that any  decision should bebased on such information.  In the case of a  public local  inquiry  held as preliminary to a judicial decision, it is in our opinion  essential  that the  forms  and methods  appropriate  to judicial proceedings  should  be strictly observed.  But  when a  public local  inquiry is  held as  preliminary to aquasi-judicial decision by a Minister it  is not  reasonable or prac-ticable that  the  inspector should be entirely bound  by the practiceof Courts of Law.  He is not inquiring solely into facts or law;he  is not as a  rule a lawyer  and while  bis  main function is toascertain facts it is sometimes his duty to form his own views on public policy or  at any rate to weigh all the circumstances in termsof public policy.  Although the final decision is not taken by him,to make the  inspector^ inquiry purely legal and  formal  mightdefeat  its purpose.   We recommend, however, to the study ofother Departments  the  instructions  issued  by the Ministry of-&apos;- 15  &amp; 16 Geo.  5, c. 16.
 Health to inspectors (of which a copy will be found in the second of the companion volumes  to our Report : Eleventh clay Evidence) with a view to securing that in the conduct of their inquiries they shall pursue the methods of natural justice.   It should be  clearly realised that  these instructions are  not  an immutable code,  but form a set  of instructions  for  the general guidance of a body of responsible  officials, and  that the  inquiries are  of so  various a character and  the issues so  diverse that  rigid adherence to  the text in  all cases  must be conditioned by the need of attaining the objects of the inquiry, viz., the  ascertain- ment of facts and the presentation of views for the assistance of the  Minister in arriving at his decision.   Another line of complaint is that one officer (the inspector) holdsthe  inquiry and  another   (who is unknown) gives the  decision, and it has been suggested  either that the inspector should himselfdecide the case  or that whoever decides it in fact should  be designated-nated by  name  and should hold an  open public inquiry  at whichpresumably  the inspectors report  would  be  part of the evidence.   On the other hand complaints have been made that decisions arenot  made  by the Minister himself or  by a very high official but  bysubordinate  officials.   Some of these complaints contradict each other and some of themappear to  be based on a confusion  between the  substance  and the forms of justice.   The publication of inspectors&apos; reports was much discussed in  allCourts  in  the case of Rex v. Local  Government Board Ex parteArlidge-7&apos;  and led to a remarkable conflict of judicial  opinion,  asthe following reference to  the judgments will show :    (1) In   the  King&apos;s  Bench  Division  Bankes   J.  expressed theopinion that it would perhaps add to  the public confidence in these   [1913] 1 K.B. 463; [1914]  1 K.B. 160;  and (sub nom. L.G.B. v. Arlidge)      [1915] A.O.  120.  A Borough Council had in pursuance of their  right      and duty under Section 17  of the  Housing, Town  Planning,  etc., Act,      1909 (9  &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c.  35), refused to determine a closing order in      respect  of  a dwelling house in  the borough  and  Mr.  Arlidge, the      assignee of the lease  of  tho dwelling house, had exercised his  right      under the section to appeal to the Local Government Board.  It was      provided by  Section 39 of the Act that the Board should not dismiss      any  appeal  without having first held a public  local  inquiry.  The      Board dismissed Mr. Arlidge&apos;s appeal after holding such an inquiry.      Mr. Arlidge applied to the High Court of Justice to quash  the order      of the Board  dismissing the appeal on the ground that the appeal      had not been determined in the manner  provided by the Law.  One      of the points taken was that the report of the inspector  who held the      inquiry  was not disclosed to Mr. Arlidge.  The  High Court refused      to quash the order.  Their decision was  reversed in the  Court  of      Appeal  but  restored by  the House  of Lords. The House  of Lords.      disagreeing with the majority of  the Court of Appeal, held unanim-      ously  that an appellant was not entitled as of right, as a condition      precedent to the dismissal  of his  appeal, to see  the report made  by      the Board&apos;s inspector upon the public local  inquiry.Conflict ofjudicialopinions on,publicationof reports.
103183inquiries if the reports of  the  inspectors were not  always treatedas confidential documents;  (2) In the Court of Appeal Vaughan Williams  &amp; Buckley L.J.J.held  that the non-production of these reports was contrary  to  theprinciples of natural justice on  which English Law  is based ;  (3) Hamilton L.J.,  while saying that, if it was the function ofthe Court of  Appeal to advise  the Local Government Board as toits procedure, or to criticise  the procedure actually adopted, heshould  for his part suggest that the Board  should  let the partiessee the inspectors report,  declared that  he could not but  feel thatall that could be urged against  the Local Government Board mightlie still more  forcibly urged against the Court of Criminal Appeal;  (4) In the  House of Lords the Lord Chancellor (Lord Haldane)said  that it might or  might  not have been  useful  to disclose  thereport;  (o) Lord Shaw of Dunfermline inclined  to hold that  the  dis-advantage in  very many cases  would exceed  the  advantage of suchdisclosure;  (6) Lord Parmoor held that  non-disclosure was not inconsistent with  substantial justice;  (7) Lord Moulton was unable to see any reason why the reports should be made public  and expressed the opinion  that their publica-tion  would cripple the usefulness of the inquiries and  that  thepractice would be decidedly  mischievous.  The  existing  practice  is  for  the Departments  to regard  the inspectors report as a confidential document for  the information ofthe Minister, and only to publish it where there  are special reasonsfor such a course.  In support  of this existing  practice the following  arguments may  Argumentsbe advanced :                                                   against  (a) Inspectors&apos; reports  of the  kind now in  question are  only a  p&quot;  &apos;cn wnstep, and only one  of many  steps,  in  the  process of reaching a ministerial decision  and are in no  different position from  any ofthe other steps.   The inquiry and the report are  preliminary  steps;and  the inspector&apos;s report is  only  one factor  in  the Ministersultimate decision, which  in most cases  is  executive.  The con-stitutional position  is thus different from that of an inquiry  and areport, for example into a factory explosion  or a railway  accident,where the inquiry culminating  in a report is  an end in itself, beingprimarily held not  as  a preliminary  to  a  Ministerial decision,  butfor the specific object of finding out facts for  the  information  of thepublic.  In the latter kind of case publication of the report  is thenormal  and  natural sequel to  the holding of  the inquiry;  in  theformer it is argued that to make the publication of the report theregular  practice  is to impair the confidential relationship betweenthe official of the Ministry  and  his Minister,  and that this relation-ship is one of the most valuable assets of  the public service.
             (6) If the report is published as a matter of course there will be           strong pressure to make its findings conclusive  and to take  that           course will defeat the intentions of Parliament by giving  the  real           power and duty of executive decision to an official instead of  to a           Minister responsible to Parliament.  It is  also pointed  out that in           many cases no inquiry ever takes place and it is urged that in such           cases,  if publication of reports is the  rule, there will be  strong           demands for the production by  the Ministry of some other document           to demonstrate the evidence on which the Minister has  acted.             (c) The inspector  who holds an   inquiry  preliminary to  a           Ministers decision is  not solely concerned with  the elucidation of           facts but is entitled and expected to give confidential advice to his           Minister as  to  the form which  the  decision  should  take. Such           advice which may, of course, conflict with  advice  tendered by           other advisers should, so it is said, no more  be  made  public  than           should be the minutes on the  Departmental file written by various           branches of  the Department; and if a general rule is made  that           reports are to  be published it will  be necessary  for the published           report to be accompauied by  a further confidential report for the           eye of the Minister and his Department alone a procedure which           would it is urged be  not only unfair to the public, but  a direct           cause of public dissatisfaction.              (d) The present system has the full  confidence of the public as           is shown by the evidence submitted to your Lordship&apos;s  Committee,           and to tamper with the  system for theoretical reasons is  to run a           very grave risk.Arguments    ^9 against these arguments  the  following  considerations  havejor publi-   weight.cation.        There is a demand  for publication, even from  witnesses like the           representatiye   of  the  Surveyors&apos;  Institution  who   spoke  most           wrarmly  in commeudation  of  the impartiality of  the inspectors of           the  Ministry of Health and the public confidence felt  in  the  Civil           Servants of that Ministry.  We think  that there is real substance           in the demand.  The  primary object of such an inquiry no doubt is           to inform the mind of the Minister who has ultimately to determine           the matters  at issue.   But  that  is  not the whole  story.  The           inquiry  is given  a particular  form and character  for the purpose.           presumably, of  satisfying those whose interests may  be  involved           that all relevant facts and considerations will  be put fairly and            impartially before the Minister, so that he may  be in  a position to            arrive at a just decision.  If the report giving  the results of the            inquiry passes into the Department and is seen  by no one but the            Minister and  his confidential advisers  doubt may well arise  as to            whether a true picture has been conveyed to the Ministers mind.            We  are told that such doubts have  arisen and, whether  they are            justified or  not,  the  existence of any  public misgiving constitutes            a good  reason for removing,  if it be possible, an obvious weakness            in the system.
134  We are not satisfied that an extension of the practice of givingreasons for decisions would really meet the demand for publicationof inspectors&apos; reports.  The reasons with  which  the  Minister ofHealth accompanies his decisions, as illustrated  by the examplesfurnished to us, are,  in the main, reasons of policy, and the facts and  arguments  brought  forward at  the  antecedent  inquiry  are referred to only so far as may be necessary to render the statementintelligible.   There is no attempt, and nothing  approaching  anattempt,  to  summarise  the  evidence or balance  the  arguments;indeed we are satisfied that  it would  be quite  impracticable to doso.   These  reports in many cases  run to great  length and dealwith a great volume of evidence and much argument.   If the ques-tion is whether such a report has given a true picture, it cannotbe  answered by  a  short description or by the communication ofextracts  but only by  the exhibition to the  critics of  the pictureitself.  Moreover, non-publication, in cases where  the decision doesnot appear to square  with the outcome of the inquiry, may readilyexpose the Inspector to the  quite unfair suspicion of having failedto do justice to his task.  To these  various arguments for and against  publication  we have  Committeesgiven prolonged consideration, and on balance have  come  to  the  aeneralconclusion that  publication is right.  By that we do not mean that  ^&quot;fa&quot;&quot;&quot;?the expense of  printing  a  long report should  in every case  be  0f puoi;.inclined; but that in all cases the report of the inspector  should  cation,be  made available  to the parties concerned and  to the  Press, andin important cases should be officially published by the*department responsible  for  the inquiry.   We fully appreciate the importance of not undermining the con-tidential  relationship between  the Minister and his officials andhowever strong the case for publication in order to  allay a publicsuspicion, we should, in the public interest, resist the demand for publication if any such  consequence were in  our judgment  likelyto  ensue.            -   We have considered the question whether the inspector or other  confidential -person  who holds the public inquiry should  be  entitled  to make  tial reports.a confidential  report to  the Minister in addition to  the report  for publication.   In our opinion this should never be done in the caseof  an inquiry  preliminary to a judicial  decision.   If  judicial  deci-sions are to be given by Ministers at all, it is essential  that they should  be given as  far  as  possible in accordance with the  formsof  justice and  that  nothing  should  reach the  ears  of  the judgebehind the backs of  the parties.   Most inquiries  however are held in connection with quasi-judicial decisions and in the case of such inquiries we do not  take so strict  a view.  Whilst we think that there should be no  confidential  reports  on those matters  of  fact or law which  come  strictly  within the  scope  of  the report of the inquiry,  we see no  objection to the tendering by separate report
publication should be with thedecision.Limitationsto Com-mittee&apos;srecommend-ation.Inquiriesnot pre-liminary tojudicial orquasi-judicialdecisions.or otherwise of such advice as the Minister may  call for  on any questions of Ministerial policy which may be involved.  We have  heard the objection  made to the  publication of the inspectors&apos; reports that it might lead to a demand  for a re-hearingby  way of  appeal  of the  questions  upon  which evidence  wastaken  at the inquiry, and  that, for obvious reasons, there oughtto be  finality in such matters.  With  the. last point we entirelyagree, but  we do  not fear any such result from the publication ofinspectors&apos; reports.   We do not recommend that  there should beany  further  investigation of the facts after a  full public inquiry.Indeed our  view would be  met  if  the inspector^  report  were communicated with the Ministers decision to the parties concerned.  In  certain cases, the Ministers decision may be influenced notonly by reasons of law or public policy  which  lie  entirely outsidethe field of the public  inquiry, but by  information which  reacheshim  through channels other than  the inspectors  report.   We donot think there is anything improper in this; but when it happens,and the Minister feels it right to make a decision  which is againstthe weight of evidence at the inquiry,  we are  of  opinion  that heshould, in  communicating his reasoned  decision,  include a state-ment as to the nature of the extraneous evidence by which he hasbeen  influenced,  and thereby remove at least  one possible source of misunderstanding  and suspicion.  We do not wish to be misunderstood as recommending the adop-tion  of any  general rule that reports submitted by inspectors totheir  Ministers should be made available to the public.  That is very far from our intention.  Our recommendation is to  be considered as limited to those cases where a public inquiry of a judicial charac-ter has been prescribed by Parliament as a step in the process of arriving at a judicial or quasi-judicial decision.  It matters not forour purpose whether  the holding of such an inquiry is enjoined bythe relevant statute in every case or only where  certain  specifiedconditions are satisfied or whether it is merely  indicated as a step which may be taken if the Minister in his discretion thinks  fit so to direct.  So  long  as  (a)  the  ultimate  decision is judicial or quasi-judicial and (b)  the inquiry,  if one is held,  must partake of adefinitely judicial character, our  recommendation  that  the report should be published is applicable.  This conclusion  follows,  as indi-cated  above, from what in our view  must be presumed  to be theobject of Parliament in providing for a public hearing of the parties in such cases as  we have in contemplation.  Our recommendation has no application to those  cases where theMinister in the ordinary course of administration may arrange forsome local inquiry or investigation, the better to  inform his mindbefore he takes some decision which is within his competence asthe head of an executive Department.   In such cases the Minister.having full discretion to arrive at his decision in his own way, should
be entirely free to deal as he thinks fit with such reports as may bemade to him.   The ordinary processes of administration might indeed be gravely impeded  were the Minister to be tied down toany  particular procedure and the fact that the Minister  may be armed by statute with a general  power to proceed by way of  local inquiry in suitable cases makes no difference so long as the matter is in essence administrative.  There may, no doubt, arise from time to time border-line cases in Border-line which a judicial  element begins to creep into the process of ad mini- cases.stration.  The procedure in such cases should,  we suggest, be left for settlement by the Minister according to the  spirit of our recom-mendation, which we think we have for all practical purposes  suffi-ciently defined in the foregoing paragraphs.                 A quotation  from Lord Sumner.  15. Before we leave the  subject of  the  procedure to be  followed in the administration of Ministerial  justice we  desire to quote inextenso some observations  made by  Lord  Justice Hamilton  (nowlord Sumner) in his judgment in Rex v. Local  Government Board,Ex parte Arlidge,&quot;&apos;1 to which we have already referred :    &quot;  If it was our function  to advise  the Local Government Board  Desirabilityas to its procedure generally, or to criticise the procedure actually for openadopted as such, I  should for my part suggest  that the more open procedure.the  procedure is the better.  By all means let  both the appellantand  the Local  Authority  see the inspectors  reports;  a discreetand  careful officer is not likely to offend, and if, in spite of discretionand  care, he is harassed by actions for libel he may well be defendedand  indemnified by his Department. By all means let the appellant,and  the Local Authority too, if it wishes, see and address the judge,it is all in his day&apos;s work.   By all means let the appellant  have thelast  word and as many of them  in reason as he likes.   Time  spent in removing a grievance or  in avoiding the sense of it, is time wellspent, and the Board&apos;s officials will, like good judges, amplify their jurisdiction by  rooting it in the public confidence.&quot;   The learned  judge was speaking strictly with reference to a par-ticular form of  appeal  to the Local  Government  Board under theHousing, Town Planning, etc. Act, 1909.275  We recognise that thepublic  interest  and the exigencies of administration may preventthe  literal application of his words to all judicial and quasi-judicialproceedings before Ministers and to all judicial proceedings beforeMinisterial Tribunals ; but we accept their spirit and commend them to the notice of all who are charged with the duty of dispensing Ministerial justice.-,l [1914]  1 K.B. 160 at 203-4.a&quot; 9 Edw. 7, c. 44.

In our opinion the maintenance of the rule of law demandsthat a party aggrieved  by the judicial decision  of  a Minister orMinisterial  Tribunal  should  have  a right  of  appeal  from thatdecision to the  High Court on any point of  law.  In  matters  whichreally pertain to administration, jurisdiction  is often appropriatelyassigned to Ministers  or Ministerial Tribunals rather than  to theordinary Courts of Law, but  we  see no  justification  for shelteringthem from  the Courts of Law in  so far as the exercise  of their jurisdiction  involves a judicial decision; and  we  are of opinionthat to confer such immunity upon  them is contrary  to the consti-tutional principle underlying the rule of law.  It is, in our opinion, of great practical importance that a uniform and simple procedure  should be  established  for  all  such  appeals.In general     (a) the time within which appeals may  be brought should be           strictly limited;     (b) the appeals should be determined  in a summary manner;     (c) the appeal should be  to a single  judge of the High  Court,           and the question of appropriating particular  judges  for           such cases  (on the lines of the Commercial  Court and           revenue cases) should  be considered;     (d) the decision of  the High  Court on an  appeal  should be           final.But we recognise that there may  occasionally  be  legal questionsof unusual  importance, and  for these we would  give  the  HighCourt  and  the Court of  Appeal power to  give  leave  to  appealfurther.                              Appeals on questions of fact.Appeal on      17. While we are of opinion that there should be  an absoluteissuesoffact and universal right of appeal to the High Court on any point ofundesirable  ^aw irom kne judicial decision  of a  Minister  or  a  Ministerial Tri-           bunal, we are satisfied  that  there  should as a rule be^no  appealPossibility   to  any  Court of Law on  issues of fact.  We recognize, however.of excep-    that very exceptionally  it  may be  desirable that the  statute con-thiTrule    ferring  the powers of adjudication on the Minister or Ministerial           Tribunal should provide for an appeal on issues of fact to a specially           constituted Appeal Tribunal.   Such  an Appeal Tribunal might, we           would suggest,  consist of  three  persons, of whom one  should be a           barrister or  solicitor of not less than seven years&apos; standing, who           would be the chairman of the Tribunal.   The Lord Chancellor           should appoint  or  concur in the appointment of its members, and
186also be  empowered  to make regulations  with respect to the pro-oedure of such  an Appeal Tribunal  and especially  to  provide  byhis regulations for the speedy determination of appeals.276  We  are definitely  opposed  to any right  of  appeal  from  an administrative  decision whether  it  contains a  judicial  elementor not.Judicial Decisions;  distinction between Ministers and Ministerial                            Tribunals.  18.  Without  modifying  the  view  already expressed  that  thepresumption should always be in favour of using the ordinary Courts,we are  of opinion that where Parliament  is satisfied that certainjudicial  issues arising out of the administrative work of a Depart-mcnt are not suitable for decision by the ordinary Courts, parliament should, in the absence of any exceptional reason for referring them tothe decision of the Minister himself, provide for  their reference to  Desirabilityan independent person or  persons, not being an officer or officers of  .0&apos;&quot;J^the Department concerned.277   If such  issues are  likely to arise  tribunalswith  any frequency  in  any  class  of  case  it might  be wellfor Parliament  to constitute a  permanent specialised Tribunal todeal with cases of that class.  The decisions  of any  such Tribunal,whether permanent or appointed ad hoc, should be  independent ofthe Minister;  but we see  no  reason for  disturbing  the existing  Procedurepractice of appointment  by the Minister,  except that  in the case  andap-of the more important appointments we think the Lord Chancellor  ^J&quot;^&quot;&apos;should  be consulted.                                               Tribunals.  Section 16 of the  Import Duties Act, 1932,277a which provides for Recentthe settlement by arbitration of  any  dispute as to  the value of goods example ofsubjected to  duty, affords an interesting illustration of the present ani^^attitude of Parliament to  the  subject of judicial  decisions upon j*jL,najquestions arising out of the administration of a taxing statute.  Thedispute is referred to a single referee: that referee is appointed bythe Lord Chancellor;  all  officials of Government Departments aredisqualified for the office : and no appeal on  fact  or  law is allowed.We thus have  recognition by Parliament  of the need of a specialtribunal which will  become  specially experienced in the technique of the subject assigned to  its jurisdiction ; of the importance of quick 2:0 The provisions of the Schedule to the War Pensions  (Administrative  Pro-      visions) Act, 1919 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5,  c. 53), which regulate the constitu-      tion, jurisdiction and procedure of Pension Appeal Tribunals might be      adapted. -r7 See also above paragraph 10, at page 97.    22 Geo. 5, c. 8 (described in Section II, paragraph 8,  at page 35).

Mr. W. A.  Robson has put before  us detailed proposals for &quot;&quot;o^alsnot       estaDUShment of a system of administrative  Courts and admin- endorscd    istrative  Law independent of Ministers  as the best remedy for            the defects of the  existing system te which our  terms of reference            are directed.   We have considered their expediency, but interesting            as they are, we cannot recommend their adoption ; in our view they            are inconsistent with  the  sovereignty  of  Parliament  and  the            supremacy of the Law.              Under the existing system  Ministers are  subject  in the exercise            of judicial and  quasi-judicial functions to  the  supervisory  juris-            diction,  and  we propose  that in future in  the exercise of their            judicial functions they should also be subject to the appellate juris-            diction of the High Court;  while on questions of policy a Minister            in the exercise of his  quasi-judicial functions will remain subject to            control by  Parliament and to the influence  of public opinion with            which he is in daily contact  and to which he  is highly sensitive.              A regularised system of administrative Courts and administrative            Law, such as Mr.  Robson proposes, would involve the abolition of            both the supervisory  and the appellate jurisdiction  of  the  High            Court in matters pertaining to administration; and we believe that            it  would  result  in the  withdrawal  to a  great extent  of  those            judicial activities, which are inseparable from administration, from            the influence of  public opinion.              We, therefore, without  hesitation advise against its adoption.              The Lord  Chief  Justice  has  himself expressed the  opinion  in            Chapter  III of  &quot; The New Despotism &quot;2;s that &quot; droit adminis-            tratif &quot;  is completely  opposed  to  the  first  principles of  our            Constitution.Administra-    The truth of this observation is clearly illustrated by the historytive Law     0f the system of administrative Law existing in  modern Erance.              Before  the  French  Revolution  the  &quot; Parlements &quot;,  which were            primarily courts  of  justice,  were  also administrative bodies,  while            the Royal &quot; Intendants &quot;, who  governed  the Provinces, exercised            judicial functions.   In 1790 the Constituent  Assembly,  eager  to            destroy all  traces of absolutism,  created a  new Constitution which            was based on  the separation of  the  legislative,  executive  and            judicial powers iu the  State.  One of the consequences of the sepn-            ration was that while  the  Courts were made  wholly independent of            the  Administration,  the Administration  was made wholly  inde-            pendent  of the  Courts   This administrative independence  gave            278 Page 41.
18rise to much dissatisfaction and it was to allay this dissatisfactionthat Napoleon gave the right of recourse  to the &quot; Gonseil d&apos;Etat &quot;in the case of alleged irregularities on the part of the administra-tion.  A few years later he  established a special committee of the&quot; Gonseil d&apos;Etat &quot;, called the &quot; Comit6 du Gontentieux &quot;, for thepurpose  of hearing  the complaints and tendering  advice to theGovernment.   The  complainants were  allowed  the  privilege  ofbeing represented by  officials specially appointed  for the purpose and known as  &quot; Avocats an Gonseil &quot;.   In  1831,  after the secondfall of the Bourbons,  an  oral hearing was  granted, and  in 1849,after  the final  collapse of  the monarchy,  the  &quot; Commission duContentieux &quot;,  as it  was  now called,  was permitted to give  judg-raents  instead  of  merely tendering  advice.    The system  thusestablished  has  flourished  ever  since alike  under  the  SecondEmpire and under the Third Republic.2&quot;  It is obvious that this system is wholly  inapplicable in the UnitedKingdom with its flexible  unwritten Constitution under which thereis no clear-cut separation of powers and the administration is subjectto the  almost  daily  supervision of  the  Courts  of Law,  as  everyreader of the daily law reports in &quot; The Times &quot; newspaper knows.  The  question  was  discussed by Professor  Dicey  in  an articleentitled &quot; The Development of Administrative Law in England &quot;in the  Law  Quarterly Review  for April, 1915.280  His conclusion was  that  although  modern  legislation  had  conferred upon  theCabinet, or upon servants of the Crown who might be influencedor guided by the Cabinet,  a considerable amount of judicial or quasi-judicial authority, the fact that the ordinary Law Courts could dealwith any actual and  probable breach of the law committed by anyservant of the  Crown still  preserved  that rule of law  which wasfatal to the existence of true droit administratif.2,1  In our opinionProfessor Dicey&apos;s conclusion  is no less true to-day than it was in1915.

It must be admitted  that the French  system  does give protection           to the French subject against the arbitrary acts of the public service,           as is lucidly shown by that distinguished French lawyer, M. Henry           Berthelemy, in  a recent article &quot; sur les pratiques administrative^           anglo-saxonnes companies  au droit administratif francais.&quot;282Frcnch       We are bound also to confess that Continental critics are justifiedcriticism    m their contention that under the rule of law in England the remedyprivileged   G^ tue SUDJect against the Executive  Government is less completeposition of  than  the remedy of subject against subject.   This branch of thethe Crown  argument in favour of establishing a system of administrative Lawin English  in England falls outside the scope of our reference,  but since  weLaw.       are reporting against the establishment  of such a system we think           we should not be doing our duty if we were to ignore it altogether.             The main defects in the subjeefs remedies against the Executive           Government are :                   (a) That owing  to  the peculiar procedure  in cases in  which               the  Crown is litigant  the subject  is to some extent placed at a               disadvantage;                  (b) That there is no effective remedy against the  Crown in               the  County Court:                  (c) That the Crown is not liable  to be sued in tort.The Crown    In  1921 the whole position of the Crown as litigant  was referredProccdings  by  Lord Birkenhead (then Lord  Chancellor) to  a Committee  pre-           sided over by Sir Gordon (now Lord)  Hewart, the  present  Lord           Chief Justice, then  Attorney General.             In  1924,  before  the Committee were able  to bring to a con-           clusion their necessarily prolonged enquiries, Lord Haldane (then           Lord  Chancellor)  requested them to  prepare  a Bill  &quot; on  the           assumption  that it was both desirable and feasible to remedy these           defects.&quot;             The  Committee  reported in 1927  and submitted  a draft  Bill           prepared by them in accordance with Lord Haldane&apos;s Minute.253             While it is no part of our duty to make any recommendation as           to the expediency of passing such a Bill into law, we  think that it           is only right that we should point out  that there is this lacuna in           the rule of law, which will still remain even if our recommendations           are wholly carried out, and that  the  passing of  such  a Bill would           fill the lacuna._           2S- Bulletin Mensuel de la Societe de Legislation Compareo Nos. -1-6 Avril-                 Juin, 1931.

188Judicial proceedings before Ministers and Ministerial Tribunals and                  the Law of Libel and Slander.  20. It is in English  law an incidental attribute of judicial pro-ceedings that defamatory statements made in their course cannotbe made the subject of  an action for libel or slander.   This protec-tion is  known  as the rule of &quot; absolute  privilege.&quot;    It applieswherever the proceeding is strictly judicial and  the  Court is per-forming  strictly judicial functions.&quot;1  The rule  has  been  held toapply to a Coroner&apos;s Court, a Military Court of Enquiry, an Eccle-siastic Commission under the Pluralities Acts  and the DisciplinaryCommittee of the Incorporated Law Society.   But there are defi-nite limits within which the decisions of the Courts have restrictedthe immunity so  conferred and the line  of limitation  is  not alwayseasy to trace.285  We do not conceive it to be within our terms of reference  to in-vcstigate this legal borderland or  to attempt to  codify the law onthe subject.  Nor do we think it  within those terms  to make  any recommendations for legislation thereon in connection  with the judi-cial and quasi-judicial decisions which are the subject of this sectionof our report.   But we have  thought it right  to  draw attention tothe question in view of the  grounds of public policy upon  whichthe protection is  founded.                            Summary.  21. We have now surveyed the  field of judicial and quasi-judicialdecisions  by Ministers and  of judicial decisions by  MinisterialTribunals,  and it only remains  to summarise our conclusions  andrecommendations.  We assume  the fundamental  necessity  of not only maintaining  Funda-but strengthening the supremacy  of the Law.  We recognise  that  mentalthis involves the equal subjection of  all classes  to  regular Law  necessity of.-  maintain-:sl See Fraser on the Law of Libel and Slander (1925,  6th Edition),  p. 187,  ing the rule      for a clear and compendious statement of the law on  the subject and  of Law.      reference to the decisions mentioned in paragraph 20.   In Collins v. Henry Whiteway cfc  Co. [1927] 2 K.B. 37S, Mr.  Justice      Horridge  laid it down that the Court of Referees merely discharged      administrative duties which need not be performed in  Court, although      in  respect  of them it was necessary to bring to bear a judicial mind.      It  was  an  action  of  libel and the  defence of  absolute  privilege      was  argued.   That depended,  in view  of  the  facts  upon which      the  argument proceeded,  on   whether the  proceedings before  the      Court  of  Referees  were  so   strictly   judicial  in  character  as      to   make   the  occasion   one  of   absolute   privilege  with  its      consequence  of immunity from liability  to  an  action for  libel      or slander in respect of a statement  made in the course of the pro-      ceedings even although malicious.  He held that they were not.  It      would seem that in describing the duties of the  Court of Referees as      &quot; administrative &quot;  the learned  Judge was using the  word loosely as      meaning  &quot; not purely judicial,&quot; for  the  purpose of distinguishing      the functions of such a departmental tribunal from those of a Court      in tho full sense.
Legislationexcludingpurelyjudicialdecisionsfrom theCourtsshould beregarded asexceptional.instances of theexceptionalcourse.Distinctionbetweenjudicial andquasi-judicial. administered by the ordinary Courts of Law and ithat sucli authority in the judicial as in the legislative sphere as Parliament may judge expedient to concede  to  the Executive  must  be consistent  with that  subjection.  We  are, therefore, unanimously of opinion that no  considerations  of  administrative  convenience,  or   executive efficiency, should be allowed to weaken the control  of the Courts. and that no  obstacle should be placed by  Parliament in the way of the subjeefs  unimpeded access to them.   We,  therefore, take the view that all legislation  which excludes purely judicial decisions from the jurisdiction of the  Courts of Law, and entrusts them exclusively to tribunals  which it deems to  be specially  qualified  to determine them should be definitely regarded as  exceptional;  and that the introduction  of  any such  legislative proposals should be jealously scrutinised  by Parliament.   In ithe past Parliament has thought fit on  various occasions to take-tke exceptional course :  it is no  part of our duty to  pronounce judgment on individual statutes  and we do not  therefore express any opinion  on those instances.   We have  for example  drawn attention to the great  measure of power which Parliament in the middle of the last century conferred on the General Medical Council to discipline the medical profession;  as we have  already said, this particular matter is outside our terms of reference,  and we  refrain therefore from  any comment on so extreme an instance  of  the exclusion of justiciable issues from the jurisdiction of His Majesty&apos;s judges.   We  again mention  it merely  for the purpose of showing that it is not only within the sphere of the central administration of the State  that legislation has been  passed  with   this  trend.  It is hardly necessary to observe that Ministers and Ministerial Tribunals so far as the United Kingdom is concerned enjoy  no powers of judicial decision except those conferred on them by Act of Parliament.  Our terms  of reference  distinguish between  those  powers which are purely judicial and those which are quasi-judicial only.   Both involve  a dispute between parties, the  presentation  by the parties of their  case, and the ascertainment of  the facts underlying the dispute  by  means of evidence adduced by the parties themselves. But a judicial decision is  one which  must be  based on the appli- cation of  the law of the  land to the  facts so ascertained; whereas in the nature of things that can never  be the basis of  a quasi-judicial decision.  Eor a quasi-judicial decision involves  considerations  of public policy, and  in the  last resort the decision  is  not a decision as to the  respective legal rights and obligations of the parties, but a decision as  to  what it is in the public interest  to  do.   The dis- tinction is well  illustrated by two instances which we have quotedof the powers and duties  of the  Board  of Education  under the Education Act, 1921.286   Under Section  19 it is the duty  of theBoard of Education to determine in case of dispute whether a schoolis necessary or  not.  That question clearly cannot  be determined   11  &amp; 12 Geo. 5, c. 61.                                            &apos;
189Quasi-judicialdecisions.by any application of  the law of the land to the ascertained facts.When all the facts have been  ascertained and the contentions of thedisputants  have been  appreciated, the question in the last resortis a  question of public policy.  On the other hand,  if a question arises  under Section 29 between the local education authority andthe managers  of  a school  not provided  by  the authority as  towhether the authority is discharging its duty under the section  tomaintain the  school and  keep it efficient, the decision of  that question which the Board is obliged by  sub-section  (9)  of theSection to  take is a strictly judicial decision, namely whether onthe true view  of the facts the authority is obeying  the law  or not.  We have expressed  the opinion  that quasi-judicial  decisions fallproperly within the province of executive Ministers, who are  respon-sible for policy and should control, direct and  administer  it, andthat such decisions should not ordinarily be assigned to any tribunalother than  the Minister.  But we  have also expressed the opinionthat  they should be inspired  by  the spirit and governed  by themethods of justice; and that the procedure  should be accompaniedby as much publicity  as may  be.  As regards judicial decisions we  have  expressed the opinion  that Judicialit is  only for exceptional reasons that they  should  be assigned by decisions.Parliament to Ministers or Ministerial  Tribunals.  When they  are  so assigned, we  are of opinion that they shouldseldom, if ever, be entrusted by Parliament to  the Minister him-self,  and that a specialised Tribunal should be created for the  pur-pose of exercising the judicial powers if there is no existing Tribunalon which they can be  conveniently conferred.  We recognise that there  are exceptional cases  in which  well con-sidered  reasons of practical convenience may justify  the  statutorygrant of judicial power to Ministerial Tribunals; that no a priorirule  can be laid down for distinguishing between one  case  andanother; and that the decision of  Parliament must be based on a consideration of all the circumstances  of the  particular plan  oflegislation before it.  Our conclusion  on the whole matter is  that there  is nothing Generalradically wrong about the  existing practice of Parliament  in  per- conclusion.mitting  the  exercise  of  judicial  and quasi-judicial powers  by ministers and  of judicial power by Ministerial Tribunals, but  thatthe practice is  capable of abuse, that dangers are  incidental to it if not guarded against, and that certain safeguards are essential ifthe rule of  law and the liberty of the subject are to be maintained.    Recommendations in regard to judicial and quasi judicial                            decisions.  22. We,  therefore,  make  the   following  specific  recommenda- judicialtions :                                                          decisions  I.  Judicial,   as  distinct  from  quasi-judicial,  functions  should y&quot;&quot;p&quot;^normally be entrusted to the ordinary  Courts of Law, and  their  Ir,^ S

II.  Where Parliament considers it necessary to depart  from thenormal course, it  should entrust  the  judicial functions involvedin the  legislation  to  a  Ministerial Tribunal rather than  to theMinister personally.  The appointment of such a  tribunal may beleft to the Minister, but  the tribunal should be independent of him in the exercise of their  functions.  Iu regard to the more importanijurisdictions so set up,  the Lord  Chancellor should be  consulted before appointments are made.  Assignment  to a Ministerial Tribunal rather than to the minister would clearly  be  right in any  case where  it appears  likely  that the Minister (in which word we include any  officer of the Depart -ment acting under his  orders)  would be likely to be precluded fromacting as a judge by the kind of Departmental  &quot;interest  &quot;  described in paragraph 3.  Judicial functions  should not be entrusted to the  Minister per-sonally unless there is  some very special and  exceptional reason forthat course and even in that event not where there is &quot; interest &quot;of the kind last-mentioned.  III. Quasi-judicial decisions fall naturally to Ministers themselves and not to Courts of Law or Ministerial Tribunals.  But in any exceptional case in which it appears probable that a  Minister maybe disqualified by  an &quot; interest  &quot; of the kind last-mentioned fromdischarging impartially the judicial functions  involved in the quasi-judicial  decision,   Parliament should  consider the  desirability  of dividing the decision  and entrusting the  judicial functions to a ministerial Tribunal whose adjudication would  be binding on theMinister  when in his discretion  he  completes  the  quasi-judicialdecision by administrative action.  IV. Before the decision is given, whether it be  judicial or quasi-judicial, each of the parties to a dispute should be given the oppor-tunity of stating his case (not necessarily orally) and also of know-ing the case which he  has to meet and of answering it if  he can.  V.  Every Minister exercising a judicial or  quasi-judicial functionand every Ministerial Tribunal exercising a-judicial function should give the decision in the form of a reasoned document.  This document  should be available to the parties.  Where thedecision is  purely  judicial, it should take the form of a judgment;but where  it  is quasi-judicial, the  specimen letters  conveying de-cisions of the Minister  of Health seem to us to be suitable for their purpose  and as a precedent they might be generally used.  The practice of the Ministry of Health in publishing  epitomes of leading cases for public guidance  should  be generally adopted.  VI. In any  case in  which  a  statutory public inquiry  is  held inconnection  with the exercise  of judicial or quasi-judicial functions by Ministers,  the  report made  by  the person holding  the inquiry
117190should be published; and only the  most exceptional circumstances and the strongest reasons of public policy should be held to justify a departure from this rule.  VII. (a) The jurisdiction  of the  High Court of Justice to  Supervisorycompel  Ministers and  Ministerial Tribunals to keep  within their  ^the k^ghpowers and to  &quot; hear  and determine  according to law &quot;,  i.e., to  Court,exercise their judicial and quasi-judicial powers in good  faith anduninfluenced by extraneous and irrelevant considerations and  fairlyand not arbitrarily, should be vigilantly maintained.  (b)  The existing  procedure  for invoking  this jurisdiction  is not satisfactory and should  be  replaced  by procedure more modern,more simple, and less expensive.  VIII. (a)  Any party  aggrieved by the judicial decision of a  Appeal onMinister or Ministerial  Tribunal should have an absolute right to  Questionsappeal to the High Court of Justice on any question of law;       0   &quot;&quot;&quot;  (b)  A  uniform and simple  procedure should be established forall such appeals.  IX. As a matter of  procedure the legal  distinction  between- an  Simplified-excess of jurisdiction for which certiorari is to-day the proper pro-  j&apos;&apos;0&quot;&apos;?reeding  and an error of  law for which an appeal  is appropriate is  procedureunimportant for the purpose  we have in view :  the new form ofprocedure might well apply to both,  and both might where con-venient  be included in the same proceeding.   For simplicity wespeak of both as an appeal.  Such  a procedure should especially provide :      (1)  that the time  within which  an appeal may  be brought          should be strictly limited;    (2)  that  the  appeal should  be  determined  in   a  summary          manner;    (3). that the appeal should be heard by a single judge; and    (4)  that his decision should, as a general rule, be  final.  X.  There should, as  a general rule, be no appeal to any  Court  Appeals on of Law from the decision of  a Minister or a Ministerial Tribunal  issues of on any issue of fact.                                              fact-  Parliament may, however,  think in certain types of legislation(as it did in  regard to  War Pensions) that there  are  likely  to beexceptional cases, where some appeals on facts should be allowed.In those cases  the appeal should be to an Appeal  Tribunal consti-tuted by the  Lord  Chancellor and consisting of three persons, &quot;ofwhom one should be a  barrister or solicitor of not less than  seven years standing,  who should be Chairman.  ,  The procedure ought to be  expeditious and governed by  suitablerules of procedure to be made by the  Lord Chancellor or the RuleCommittee.
Admiiiia-      XI. A system of administrative  Law and administrative judgestrative Law  (i.e., analogous to the  French system) should not be established:C^fown          we  desire to  record our opinion  that, unless  and until  theProceedings  Crown  Proceedings Bill or a similar measure is  passed into law,Bill.        there will still remain  a gap in  the structure of the Constitution,           where the supremacy of the Law does not prevail, even if all our           recommendations are wholly carried out.             23. In conclusion we desire to express our thanks to our Secre-           taries.   Mr. J.  H. E.  Woods, M.V.O., of the Treasury occupied           that post during most of the time  when we were collecting infor-           mation and hearing evidence, and  performed his  duties with tact           and success.  In November, 1930,  the Treasury found it necessary           to withdraw him for other work  in the Department,  and his place           was taken by Mr.  W. R. Fraser, also of the Treasury, during the           time of our deliberations and the drafting of our Beport.  His task           has been laborious  and difficult, and we are greatly indebted to him           for the valuable services which he  has  rendered to us so ungrudg-           ingiy.

REGULATIONS  made by the TREASURY  with the concurrence of the  LOUD                  CHVNCELI-OU  and the SPEAKER  of tho HOUSE of COMMONS in pursuance                  of the  RUI.ES PUBLICATION ACT,  1893.56 &amp; 57 Viet.

Now, therefore, We, the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty&apos;s Treasury.             in pursuance of the said Act,  and  of  all other powers in that behalf, do             hereby, with  the concurrence of the  Lord Chancellor  and of the Speaker             of the House  of Commons, make the  following regulations:                 1.  Every  exercise of a statutory power by a rule-making authority, which             is of a legislative and not an executive  character, shall  be held to be a             Statutory Rule within  section three of the Act and  these  regulations.               2.  An  exercise of a statutory power  which is confirmed only by  a rule-             making authority  shall not be held to be a  Statutory  Rule within  section             three of the Act or these  regulations.               3.  Except as  mentioned  in Regulation 2, the volumes of Statutory Rules             and  Orders published by the Stationery Office in 1890, 1891 and 1S92  shall             form a practical guide for determining those exercises of  statutory  powers             which should be treated  as statutory  rules within section  three of the  Act             and  these  regulations.               4. A distinction  shall be drawn between statutory  rules which  are general             and those  which are local  and personal.               5. The distinction shall  follow,  unless in exceptional circumstances, that             adopted between public Acts and  local and personal Acts of Parliament.
  ti. All statutory  rules when sent to tho Queon&apos;s  printer of Acts  of  Par-liament, as required by tho Act, shall be numbered consecutively as nearly as may he in the order in which they are received  by the Queen&apos;s printer,and either with or without a second number for a particular class of rules.  7. The main series of numbers shall  be a separate series for each calendarwar, hut statutory rules  made  in  December in any year, and  received  bytho  Queen&apos;s printer of Acts of Parliament within 14 days after the end&apos;of that year, may be  numbered with  the statutory rules of that year and included in the annual volume  of that year.  S. All statutory rules shall be  printed and sold unless, in tho case  of rulesHOC  required to be  published  in  any Gazette, tho rule-making authoritydeclare that it is unnecessary to print  and sell them, and such declaration isnot  overruled on a  reference under Regulation 15.  !). Statutory rules similar  to  public general  Acts shall he printed in  anannual volume, and that  volume shall include  a list  of tho statutory rules which are  similar to local and personal  Acts.  10. The  rule-making authority,  in sending any statutory  rule  to  theQueeu&apos;s printer  of  Acts  of Parliament,  shall  state whether  they considertho  rule to be general or local and personal,  and  that statement shall  bofollowed unless overruled on a reference under Regulation 15.  11. In the  annual volume of statutory rules the general rules shall  bopublished in a classified form, as in the volumes mentioned above in Regula-tion  3  which have  been hitherto published.  12. Regulations 6 and 8 shall apply to temporary statutory rules, but ifthey have ceased to be in  force  at the time of the publication of the annualvolume, or  will so cease a short time afterwards, they shall not bo includedin that volume, unless  tho rule-making authority inform the Queen&apos;s printerof Acts of Parliament  that they desire them to be  so  included.  13. Tho  Treasury, with the concurrence  of tho Lord Chancellor and thoSpeaker of tho House  of  Commons, may direct the exclusion from  publica-tion  at length in any  annual volume, of any  rules which it seems to themunnecessary so to  publish  by reason of their  annual or other periodicalrenewal; as, for instance, the militia  regulations, the volunteer regulations,or the education code.  14. Any statutory rule  or class of  statutory&apos;  rules which, on  the  applica-tion of the rule-making authority, may be determined by the Treasury, withthe  concurrence of the Lord Chancellor  and the Speaker of the House ofCommons, to be confidential, shall be exempted from section three of the Actand from these regulations.  15. Any question which arises under Regulation S as to the printing and sale of statutory  rules, or under Regulation 10 as  to statutory  rules beinggeneral or  local  and personal, or which arises on the application or inter-pietation of those regulations, shall bo referred to  the Treasury, and deter-mined  by  ahem  with the concurrence  of the  Lord  Chancellor and thoSpeaker of the House of  Commons.

              TREASURY  CIRCULAR OF 25TII NOVEMBER,  1921.                                                               No.  43/21.                                                Treasury Chambers,                                                   25th November, 1921.               STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS :  PROCEDURE.SIR,  1. The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury liavc had  underconsideration cases in  which complaint has been made of delay in the  supply to the  public of copies of draft statutory rules  and orders  which  becomooperative  within  a certain  period after  presentation to Parliament,, or after publication  of  a  notice  in the Official Gazette.  Inasmuch as suchdelay curtails tho  time within  which interested parties  have the right tosubmit  objections to tho orders it should clearly be reduced to the narrowestpossible limits.  2. As regards draft  orders  which are  issued to  the  public  in printedform Jly  Lords see uo  reason why copies should  not be placed on  salswithin  the period  (normally  24 hours) required by the Stationery Office to print off  copies from  the corrected proof; all that is required to   secure this being (1)  that the  order  is not  presented  or notified in  the Gazetteuntil it is actually set up  in proof and  ready for  press, and (2)  that  a press copy is sent to the Stationery Office simultaneously with  presentationor notification.  I  am to request that if  this arrangement  is  not already in operatiou in your  Department steps  may be taken  to put it  into forceforthwith.  3. The foregoing does not apply to cases  in  which,  on grounds of economy,the  draft order is not  issued  in  printed form  but is  duplicated  in theDepartment by  cheaper processes; but I am to request that similar arrange-ments  may  be  adopted  in these cases to  secure  that copies of the draft order are available to the public within 24  hours of presentation or notifioa-tion.  The Stationery Office  should  be informed in  all such  cases in orderthat they may  be  able  to direct applicants where copies can bo  obtained,for all  probable needs.  4. In this connection Their  Lordships have had under consideration theunnecessary  expenditure of public money which arises in  certain cases fromthe reprinting in  other forms of documents which have already been issuedor will  in  due course be issued as statutory rules and orders, either in draftor final form;  cases having been reported  to  Them  of  documents  being setup  in  type and printed five times  over.   While it  may  not  be possible inevery case to restrict the issues of  a document to the one  (statutory  rule and order) form,  They think that  this should be  regarded  as the  normal course and departure  from it should only be allow-ed  on exceptional grounds.I am to request, therefore, that directions may be given that all documents which  will eventually be issued as statutory rules  and  orders  should heset up  in the  standard  form at the outset and  that  as a general  ruleno  variation be made from this form in subsequent  issues except minor alterations of headings, &amp;c.  In particular such rules should not be  printedin the  official Gazettes,  a notice in  the terms of Section  3 (3) of the RulesPublication Act, 1S93, being all that is required  in such cases.   These in-structions should  be regarded  as extending  also to  documents  laid  beforeParliament which have  been or may eventually be issued as  statutory rules and orders.  5. With a view  to indicating more clearly  the exact significance of docu-ments of this character  I am to request that the  following detailed instruc-tions may be observed:        (a) Draft  rules which have to  be laid before Parliament  should  bear at    tho head a note  showing that  before they become statutory &quot;rules and
    orders  they require confirmation by the  resolution of both  Houses  ol    Parliament or that they are subject to disallowance  as tho case may bo.      (6)  Rules  which  are not  operative until a  prescribed  period has    expired after presentation to Parliament should boar a similar note.      (c) Every statutory  rule and order in its  final form should show tho    date of  its  coming  into  operation  and  statutory rules superseding    similar  &quot; Provisional &quot;  Rules Should  indicate either in  the preamble    or in a footnote the date on which tho  provisional rules came  into force.      (d)  &quot; Provisional &quot;  rules should  in  all cases be  superseded  by  rules    in final form as early as possible.      (c) Every rule or order should  contain a  &quot; Short Title &quot; clause.  6. (My Lords are aware that tho foregoing instructions may not  be entirelyapplicable  in  certain  special cases and reference  should be  made on anydoubtful points to the  Official Editor of Statutory Rules and Orders (2, Har-court Buildings, Temple,   E.C.)  who will,  where necessary,  communicate with this Department.                                   I am,                                       Your obedient  Servant,                                                         G. L. BAHSTOW.                               ANNEX II.

ANNEX IV.                         MINISTERIAL TRIBUNALS.              1. Contributory Pensions (England and Wales).  The only Tribunal for hearing  appeals  against decisions of the  Ministerof Health is the panel of Referees set up  under Section 29 of the Widows&apos;,Orphans&apos;  and Old  Age Contributory  Pensions Act,  1925.1  That  Sectionprovides that  tho Referees are to be selected from a panel appointed under regulations to bo made by the National Health Insurance Joint Committee(a body constituted under Section 88 of  the National Health Insurance Act,1924,- and consisting of tho Minister of Health, the Secretary for Scotland,tho Minister of  Labour for Northern Ireland, and  a person appointed  bytho Minister  of Health and having special knowledge and experience  ofnational health insurance in Wales).  The regulations made under Sections29 (2) and 30 (1) (b) of tho  Act of 1925 are S.R. and O. 1928, No. 460.  Theappointment  of  the panel is  dealt with in  Article 3.  The  decision of theReferee or Referees who  deal with tho  case  is final  and  conclusive,  but under Section 19 of  the  Arbitration Act, 1889,3 which is applied by  thefirst schedule  to the regulations,  the Referee or Referees can be  requiredto state a case for the opinion of the Court on any  question of law arising in the course  of the reference.  There are  at  present 16  Referees working under  these  regulations,  ofwhom two are usually described as the Senior Referees and  deal with casesinvolving  important points of principle.  The  regulations themselves make no provision  for Senior Referees  as such, and the Senior Referees do notact as a court of appeal from the Junior, but in  order  to preserve some measure of uniformity it has been found of great value to have two Refereeswhose opinions are recognised by the remainder as carrying special weight.  As  already  stated,  the  appointments lie in the  hands of the  national health  Insurance Joint Committee, but when the system was set up, it was felt that the selection of suitable persons was a matter of such  importance that the co-operation of the Attorney-General was invited,  and it has  from the outset been the  invariable practice that Referees are appointed only  ontho nomination of the Attorney-General  for the time  being.  Tho regulationsdo not  provide  for  any particular term  of office.   Up  to  the present thework  involved in  deciding the claims  of widows and others who becameentitled at the inception either of the Act of 19251  or of that of 19291 hasbeen  sufficient to  require  some  12  to 16 Referees,  and  they  have  beenappointed on a  yearly basis  since  it has been uncertain what number ofpermanent Referees would  be required when the initial work of  bringing1  15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5, e. 70.2  14 &amp; 15 Geo. 5,  c. 38.3  52 &amp; 53 Viet., c. 49.4  20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5, c. 10.
tho  Acts  into operation  was over.  One or two Referees have  resigned on receiving  other appointments, but no question of dispensing with the servicesof a Referee has  as  yet  arisen.  Tho  method of  appeal  to  tho Referees is tho only procedure  by which aclaimant  can question the decision of tho Minister.                   2.  Contributory  Pensions  (Scotland).  Section 29 (2) of tho Widows&apos;,  Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pen-sions Act, 1925, provides that if  any person is dissatisfied  with tho awardor decision of tho Department  of Health  in  respect  of any  pension the question  shall, on application  being made, be referred to one  or morereferees selected  in accordance  with the regulations  made by the  national health Insurance  Joint Committee from a panel  of  Referees appointed  inaccordanco  with  tho regulations.  The  regulations which havo been madeunder  this sub-section aro the Contributory Pensions Reference  Regulations(Scotland),  1925 (S.R.  &amp; O.  1925, No.  1406, S. 101).  Articlo  3 of tho regulations provides that for the purpose of dealing withreferences under the  above montioned sub-section tho Joint  Committee shall appoint a panel  of referees,  being advocates or solicitors.   No member  orofficer  of tho  Department  shall  be appointed  a member of tho  panel.Appointments are made for such period as the Joint Committee may think fit and any person who has ceased to be a  member of the panel of Refereesis eligible for re-appointment.  Tho  panel in Scotland consists of three persons all of whom are advocatesand  two are sheriffs.  Tho  above  mentioned sub-section  provided  that the  decision of theReferees should be final and conclusive  hut by  Section 26 of the  Widows&apos;,Orphans&apos;  and Old Ago Contributory Pensions  Act, 1929,1 which came intooperation on 2nd  January, 1930,  it is provided that the Referees may,  onthe  application  of any  party to the reference,  at any stage  in  tho  pro-ceedings and shall, if so directed by either division of the Court of Session,state a case on any question of law arising in the reference for  the opinionof either divisionrfof the Court of Session.3. The Rents  Tribunal  in connection with  Assisted Housing  Schemes under          the  Housing, Town Planning etc. (Scotland) Act,  1919.5  By  Articlo  VII  (4)  (a)  of  the Local  Authorities  (Assisted  HousingSchemes)  Regulations (Scotland)  1919,  made  under  Section 5  of  tho  Act,it is provided  that in the event of any difference of opinion arising betweenthe  Department  of  Health  and  a Local  Authority with  regard  to thesufficiency of  the  rents charged  or proposed to  be  charged or as  to thefailure of the Local  Authority to  secure due economy  in the carrying contributory administration of their  housing scheme, the question at  issue shall  bereferred   for decision to  a  Tribunal  appointed  as provided  for  in theRegulations.  In accordance  with tho  regulations   as  amended by later  regulationsdated  4th August, 1921, the Tribunal  consists of two  members appointedby the Department,  one member  nominated  by  the Convention  of RoyalBurghs, and one member nominated by the Association of County councils in Scotland and  of a Chairman to be  appointed by the four  members  sonominated.  If at a  meeting of the Tribunal the  four  nominated  members are not present the Tribunal are  entitled to act through a  Committee con-sisting of the  Chairman and two members, one of whom shall be a membernominated by  the Department and the  other shall be a member nominated* 20  &amp; 21 Geo. 5, c.  10.5 19 &amp; 20 Geo. 5. c.  60.
either by  the  Convention of Royal Burghs or by  tho  aforesaid association and any decision of such Committee shall be deemed  to be a decision  by  thoTribunal.  Tho members of the Tribunal continue in office  until they  resign or die.Recourse  to the Tribunal  is tho  only method of  appeal and tho decisionof the Tribunal is final and conclusive.                     4. Income  Tax:  Non-Rcsidcnts.  Under Rule 9 (2)  of the General Rules applicable to all Schedules of  theIncome Tax Act, 1918,&apos;  in connection with the assessment of the profits ofnon-residents trading here through resident agents, it is provided  that incertain circumstances, where the charge is based  on a percentage  of  theturnover,  &quot; if either  the resident  person or tho  non-resident  person isdissatisfied with the percentage determined in tho first instance  or  by  theGeneral or Special  Commissioners on  objection or  appeal, ho  may  within four months  of that determination  require  the Commissioners to refer  thequestion   of   the  percentage  to  a  Referee or  a   Board  of  Refereesto  be appointed  for  the purpose  by  the  Treasury, and  the decisionof the Referee or Board shall be final and conclusive.&quot;  This provision has never been bronght  into operation  by taxpayers  andno appointments have been made by tho Treasury of any Referee or Boardof Referees.5. The Adjudication Machinery set  up under  the  Unemployment  Insurance                             Acts,  1920-1930.  (i) Section 8 of the  Unemployment Insurance Act, 1930/  provides thatclaims to  benefit and  all questions arising  in connection with such claimsshall  be determined by  specially  appointed statutory authorities:  namely,the Insurance  Officer, Courts  of Referees  and the  Umpire.  The Ministerof Labour has no power to admit or reject any claim.  Further the decisionsof the Umpire are final, there being no power of  appeal or reference from him to the  Courts of  Law.(ii) Insurance Officers.  Insurance  Officers are  appointed by the Minister  under Section 12  (1)of the Unemployment Insurance Act,  1920.8  They  are, for the most part,members of the established staff of the Ministry  and  are of various grades of pay.  There is at least one Insurance  Officer at each  of the 1,100 Local offices of the Department, of which 400 are  Employment  Exchanges and  700 areBranch  Employment Offices:  there are two or more  Insurance Officers at each of the seven Divisional Offices of the Ministry of Labour,  and thereis a staff  of twenty-two Insurance Officers at Headquarters.  The powers of  Insurance Officers are set out in Section  8 of the Unern-ployment  Insurance Act, 1930.7   Under that  section, all claims  to  benefit and all questions arising in connection with such  claims must be  submittedforthwith  for  examination to an Insurance Officer, who may allow benefit ifhe is  of opinion that it ought  to be  allowed, but (save for the class  of  casementioned in the  next paragraph)  must refer the  matter  to the Court of referees for  decision,  if he does not allow the claim.  The exception referred to is that of a question  whether the claimant  lostemployment owing to a stoppage of  work due to a  trade dispute.  In sucha case, the Insurance  Officer, instead of referring the matter to  the CourtG S &amp; 9 Geo.  5. c. 40.7 20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5.  c. 16.&quot; 10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5. c. 30.
of Referees,  may  disallow the  claim  himself.  In such cases, the claimanthas tho right oi appeal, within 21 days, (or such further time as may he allowed for special reasons)  to tho Court of Referees.  The  Insurance Officer has also a right of appeal to the  Umpire againsttho decision  of a Court of Referees in  all cases.(iii)  Courts of licferees.  Courts of  Referees  have  heon set  up  for about 300  districts  in  GreatBritain.  They are established under Section 13 of tho Unemployment  Insur-anco Act,  1920,8 which  provides that a Court shall consist of  one or more members chosen to represent employers, with an equal number of memberschosen to represent insured  contributors, and a Chairman appointed  by the minister.  The  constitution  and procedure of the Court are further regulated  by theCourts of  Referees Regulations, 1930.  Under these  regulations the  Courtconsists of one employers&apos; representative and ono representative of insuredcontributors,  in addition to  the  Chairman,  but  it  is  also provided  (inaccordance with sub-section  2 of Section  13), that,  with  the consent  of theclaimant but not otherwise,  the Court may proceed in the absence of eitheror both of tho representative members  (but not of the chairman).  Tho  Chairmen are appointed by the Minister after consideration of suitablecandidates and  after consultation  with the  Attorney  General in respect  ofthe Metropolitan  District,  County Court Judges in respect of other partsof England,  and the  Secretary  of State for Scotland in respect of Scotland.Tho  National Confederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations  and tho general council of the Trades Union Congress are notified of any vacancy and given  an opportunity of  submitting recommendations.  The large majority  of the chairmen  are drawn from  tho legal  profession.  The  Chairmen are  not  intho ordinary sense members of tho staff of the Ministry.   Their  appoint-ments  are  in all cases limited to one  year, subject  to  one month&apos;s notice on either  side, but are in general renewed  from year to year.   Their remunera-tion takes  the form of a fee for each  sitting, with travelling and subsistenceexpenses if incurred.  The  members  representing employers  and insured  contributors respectivelyarc appointed by the  Minister.  They hold office for three years and  areselected from local  persons  in each district generally on the  recommenda-tion of the Local Employment Committee for the district concerned.   Repre-sentative  members receive  travelling and subsistence allowances and  allow-ances for loss of wages, but no fees or other remunerative  payments.  A representative of employers must be  either an employer of  insured con-distributors  or a nominee of  an  association of such  employers or a member or officer  of a corporate body  employing insured contributors.  An insuredcontributors&apos;  representative must  be either himself an insured contributoror  a nominee of an  association of  insured contributors.   The  panels  ofmembers include women as well as men and it is arranged as far as possiblethat the representative members of the Court shall be women when women&apos;seases are being  considered.  Persons  are disqualified  from sitting if  they  are  interested  in  any way in a case under consideration by the Court,  or if they are claiming  unemploy-ment benefit.  Particulars of any  case as it is to be submitted to the Court are  forwarded to the  claimant who  has the right to attend the hearing  of  his ease andto bring a representative (other than a barrister or a solicitor).   The decisionof the  Court is communicated  in writing  to  the  claimant, and  ho  is alsofurnished  with the report of the proceedings of the Court as soon as possible after the hearing.   8 10 &amp; 11  Geo. 5, e. 30.
local Referees.  In order to provide for outlying places where tho number of cases arisingis too small to justify sittings of Courts of Referees and where the claimantswould  find  it inconvenient  or  impossiblo  to reach  the  centre where thosittings take place, tho Court of Referees Regulations authorise tho Insur-aiice Officer to refer any case to Local Referees consisting of one representa-tivo  of employers  and one  representative  of insured contributors drawn from the panels resident in  the neighbourhood in which the claimant resides.Tho main function of the Local Referees is to furnish findings of fact  uponwhich tho  Insurance  Officer or  the Court of Referees may base a decision.The  Referees report  to the  Insurance Officer who decides either  to  allowflic claim on their report or to refer it to the Court of Referees.(iv) The Umpire.  Section 12 (1) and (3) of the Unemployment insurance Act, 1920,&apos;  providesfor tho appointment  by the Crown of an JJmpire and one or  more DeputyUmpires,  and for payment  of  their remuneration out of monies providedby Parliament.    There are  at present one Umpire  and several DeputyUmpires..  Section 8  (5)  (6) of the  Unemployment  Insurance  Act, 1930,7  providesfor appeals to the  Umpire  in certain  circumstances and  that  the decisionof  the Umpire on any appeal shall be final.  Tho circumstances in which anappeal may be made to the  Umpire are as follows:      (a) at  the instance of  the Insurance Officer in any case;    (6) at  the instance of an association of employed persons  of which the          claimant is a member in any case;   (c) at  tho  instance of  the  claimant  if  the decision  of  the Court of          Referees is not unanimous  or  otherwise with  the  leave of the          Court.   The  Court  is  directed  to  have  regard  in   deciding          whether leave to appeal should bo granted to the importance of          the principle involved  in tho  case  or  any  other special circum-          stances.  Appeals to the  Umpire must be  brought within six months after the dateof  the Courfs decision or within such longer  period  as the Umpire may, forspecial reasons, allow.                      6. Pensions  Appeals  Tribunals.  These Tribunals were constituted under the War Pensions Acts, 1919-1921,&apos;to hear appeals from decisions  of the Minister of  Pensions  (a) where theMinister  has rejected a claim as  not  attributable to or aggravated by war service (&quot; Entitlement  Tribunals &quot;) or (b)  where  a claimant is dissatisfied with  the final award made in his case by  the Minister (&quot; Assessment Tri-tribunals &quot;).  In  England the members of the Tribunals are appointed by the Lord Chan-cellor and  consist of:    Entitlement Tribunals:   Legal  Representative  (Barrister  or  solicitor  of at least  seven years&apos;      standing),   Service Member  (Disabled  officer  or soldier),   Medical  Practitioner.  Assessment Tribunals:   Two  Medical Practitioners,   One  Service Member.D  9  &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c.  53; 10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5, c. 23; 11 &amp; 12 Geo. 5,  c. 49.
  Tho work has diminished very considerably and  there are now only  threetribunals  in  England.  There  is no  alternative method of appeal and thedecision is final.  There  are  separate tribunals for  Scotland,  Northern  Ireland,  and theIrish Free State, all  now on a  sessional basis.  Appointments are made forScotland by the Lord President of the Court of Session and for Ireland by the Secretary of  State.                          7. Gas Administration. .  It is provided  by Section .4  of  tho Gas Regulation Act, 1920,10  that theBoard  of Trade  shall appoint  three  persons to  act  as Gas  Referees, andalso  a  competent and impartial person to be Chief Gas  Examiner.   these officers hold  omce  for such time  and  on such conditions as  the Board  ofTrade direct, and  by Section  7 their  salaries,  remuneration, pensions and gratuities, shall  be such as may be  fixed by tho  Board  with  tho consentof the  Treasury.  It is also provided by Section 4 that a Local Authority (unless they arethe  undertakers)  or  a County  Council  with  the consent  of the  LocalAuthority, may  appoint a competent and  impartial  person to  bo  a GasExaminer  to  test gas and the pressure  subject to tho prescription  of the gas  Referees.  Quarter  Sessions  may  on the application of  not less  than five consumers, appoint  an examiner where  none is appointed by the LocalAuthority.  By Section 5 it is  provided that the Gas Referees shall prescribe:        (a)  the  places and times  at which  and the apparatus and method  by    which tests,  whether continuous  or intermittent,   shall  be  made  to    ascertain  whether any undertakers with  respect to whom  an order has    been  made under this  Act are  supplying gas in  accordance with  their    obligations;  and      (6) the method by which any such apparatus  shall be  verified; and      (c)  the time  and form of  the reports to be made by tho  Gas Examiner    to the Gas Referees and  the Local Authority or  Quarter Sessions  by    whom  he is appointed,  and to the  undertakers, and the means by which    the results of the tests shall be made available to the public.

I wholly concur in tho conclusion of  tho Committee that it is  undesirable to transfer  the  interpretation of statutes which  define  and control  theadministrative process (whether local or central) to special Courts.   No gainwhich might  result thorofrom  in  flexibility of  construction seems  to me tocounterbalance  the value  of  the independent assessment of statutory inten-tion which is now afforded by the ordinary Courts.  The historic principle ofthe rule  of  law cannot, I think, bo better protected  than by making  theordinary judges the men who decide  tho legality of executive action.  But this is not to say that tho methods of  interpretation now used bythe Courts are satisfactory.  Tho  report assumes that tho difficulties felt  are merely a matter of the inherent problems of drafting; and  that, consequently,an improvement in the technique of  draftsmanship  will,  of itself,  enabletho judges fully to express the intention of Parliament in their decisions.  While I concur with all that is said in the report about the need,  especiallyin view of the  admirable  work it now performs,  to strengthen the Parlia-mentary  Counsels office,  I cannot accept the view  that  this, of itself,  will produce a satisfactory system of statutory interpretation.   Tho  canons ofthe historic  method  now  operative seem to me  defective in a number ofparticulars; (1)  they exaggerate the degreo to which the intention  of Parlia-ment may be discovered from tho  words of a statute; (2) they under-cstimatethe degree to which tho personality of the judge, what Mr. Justice Holmeshas called his &quot; inarticulate major premiss &quot;,&quot;  piays a part in determining the intention he  attributes to Parliament; (3)  they  exaggerate  both  the certainty and tho universality of the  Common  Law as a body of  principlesapplicable, in the absence  of statute, to all possible  cases; (4) they minimise the possibilitity  that  the judge  can,  in  his  work  of interpretation, fullyoperate the principle of Heydoii&apos;s case&apos; and consider the evil the statute  was intended to remedy so that their  construction  may suppress the mischief  andadvance the  remedy.  They  thus  make the task of considering the relation-ship  of  statutes, especially in  the realm of great  social experiments, to  thesocial welfare they are intended  to promote one in which  the end involvedmay  easily  become  unduly  narrowed  either by reason  of the  unconsciousassumptions of the judge, or because he is observing principles of interpreta-tion  devised  to  suit interests  we  are  no longer concerned to protect in  thesame degree  as  formerly.  I will  not  burden  this note with  an excess of illustration.  But anyone who considers the history of the statutes  dealing  with  workmen&apos;s  compensa-tion  would,  I conceive, find  it difficult to avoid the conclusion that some ofthe judges, at least, misled by their no doubt unconscious dislike of limitationsupon freedom of contract imposed by these statutes,  minimised much of their force  by  interpreting away their  safeguards.  It  is, I think,  also clearthat  in the  history  of trade union  legislation principles of the common law,  previously unknown, were invoked to narrow  their purposes in a way which defeated  the clear  intention of those statutes; tho Taff Vale  caseJ,and the contrast between the decision  in the Mogul Steamship Case5, on theone hand,  and  the  line of  judgments beginning  with Lumley v.  Gi/c&apos;  and  1 Miss W7ilkinson concurs in this note.  - Lochner v. New York, 19S  U.S. 45,  76.  3 (15S4) 3 Co., Bep. 8.  1 (1901) A.C. 426.  5 (1S92) A.C. 25.  &apos; 2 E. &amp; B. 224.
ending with Quinn v*.  Leathern1, will sufficiently illustrate this thesis.  Whenthe Divisional Court held that attendance by school children at performancesof Shakespeare&apos;s plays could not be regarded, as an object of &quot; educational &quot;expenditure&quot;; or whon it is held by the House of Lords that a power in LocalAuthorities to pay &quot; such salaries and wages as they........may think fit &quot;  means, in fact,  such salaries and  wages as the Houso  of Lords  may consider &quot;reasonable&quot;;3  it  seems to me clear that there  is a  discretionbeyond the  mere  compulsion  of  words  in  tho  judicial  interpretation of statues.  And this discretion, as I think, enables the judge to substitute his private notions of legislative  intention for those which the  authors  of thestatute sought to fulfil.  In  the absence of any guidance beyond tho  words of tho statute itself, 1venture, therefore, to doubt whether the judge has in fact a sufficient clueto the  policy which is behind  the legislation.   He  must,  as Heydon&apos;s  casesought  to insist, tako  proper  account of tho end tho statute was intendedto serve.  Our  legal tradition  assumes that training in  tho law  alone willenable him  to do this; a  proposition I have difficulty in accepting.   But I agree that the strength of that tradition  would make it difficult to persuade the judiciary to embark upon the examination of material for the elucidationof that end to which neither judicial  nor legislative  authority attaches.Indeed  the  result of such  an adventure might be to widen,  rather than tonarrow, tho present discretion of the judge.  But it seems to me that there is a middle way. If statutes do not  plainlyavow  their  intention  by their words, the desirable  thing is, I submit, to attach to them an  authoritative  explanation  of intention.  This could bedone  in one of two ways:  (1) as was so often the case in tho Tudor period,by way of  preamble to the statute itself.  There would here be sot out, asclearly  as draftsmanship will  permit,  the end the statute has in view; or(2) by way  of memorandum in explanation of the statute.  It is well  known that it  has become increasingly the practice  in  modern legislation to issue to members of  Parliament  a  memorandum in explanation  of any complexlegislation  that is laid before them; a  good example is the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the  Ohildren&apos;s Bill  now  under  discussion by Parliament.   The value of these memoranda is  great;  and they  would.I suggest, be of real assistance to the judge iu discovering the purpose thestatute is intended to  serve.  Objections to  this course are, I understand, urged on several grounds. Itis said  that a  preamble  is,  strictly,  without legislative  force, since  it is merely  a guide  to the  meaning of a statute.  This is, of course,  true;  but-it is  at least an  authoritative guide  which,  in  the hands of a competentdraftsman, could  hardly fail to  be  an instrument  of  clarification,  a  goodmean, as Coke put it,10 for collecting the intent,  and showing the mischiefswhich the makers  of  the  Act intended to remedy.  It is argued, further.that the memorandum of  explanation sets forth the purposes  of the bill as it leaves the Department in which it originated. The Bill may be changedin Committee or on Report;  and since it is,  in any case, no part  of thestatute, by our  rules of interpretation, it would have no standing before theCourts. But on the first point I confess that it does not seem to me beyondthe wit of man, and  certainly  not  beyond  the wisdom  of  a Department,to issue a  revised  memorandum after  a  Bill  has gone through   all its stages,  in  which account  is  taken of  the changes  which  discussion  hasmade.  Upon the second,  it seems to  me that authority could be conferred  7 (1901) A.C. 495.  8 It. v. Lyon, 38 T.L.R. 62.  3 It. v. lioberts, 1925, A.C. 578.   I venture to refer to my Studies in Lawand Politics (Chap. IX) for a full discussion of this case.  10 4 Inst. 330.
upon the judges  to utilise the memorandum in their work of interpreta-tion.  I am not, bo it noted, asking that they should bo so bound by it thatthey havo no alternative  but to accept its terms;  1 am suggesting only that it  wMl  bo  found  an  invaluable guide  for  tho judge  in his task ofdiscovering what  a statute is really  intended to  mean.  I suggest, further,that tho history of statutory  interpretation, especially since the nineteenth century, indicates plainly the need for such a guido if the rule of law is toho maintained  in its historic amplitude.  [  cannot put my point  bettor than  by quoting  tho words of&apos; one of thomost  eminent  of English  jurists,  Sir  Frederick  Pollock.    &quot; Thero  is  anholo science of interpretation &quot;,  he writes&quot;,  &quot; better  known  to judges and  parliamentary draftsmen  than to  most members  of  the  legislatureit?elf.   Some of  its  rules cannot  well  be  accounted for  except on  thotheory  that  Parliament generally   changes tho  law  for  the worse,  andthat the business of tho judges Is to keep  tho mischief  of  its interferencewithin the narrowest possible bounds.&quot;  Legislation construed by the  his-toric canons  of analysis which our Courts adopt  is too often so interpreted as to defeat tho real  intention of  tho  legislator.   I  havo  illustrated  thisfrom a  narrow field; it would be possible to do  so from  tho  wholo field  ofthe  law.  I suggest  that the method of  interpretation  should.- be  lessanalytical and more functional in character; it should seek to discover thoeffect of the legislative precept in  action so as  to give  full weight to thosocial value it  is intended to secure.   The enlargement  of  the  sources  of interpretation  I  have  ventured to  indicate as desirable would,  I  think,contribute  in an important way to  this  objective.  They  would enablestatutes to be viewed not  in  isolation, not  as abstract principles  separated from  the  social  conditions which  provide  their real  motive-force, but  inthe  framework of the  circumstances to which they owe their origin.   Toview them in this way would, I believe,  greatly add  to  the  respect  inwhich the Courts are  hold.  Thereby  it would  give a new vigour to thecreative power of what the  rule of  law  implies.                                                  HAROLD J.  LASKI.                                                     17th  March, 1932.                              ANNEX VI.    NOTE BY MISS  ELLEN WILKINSON ON DELEGATED  LEGISLATION,  WITH                   FURTHER NOTE BY PROFESSOR  LASKI.  While agreeing  generally with this  report I  would like to add a noteregarding  the  tone of certain passages  which  rather give the impression that the delegating  of  legislation  is  a necessary  evil, inevitable in thepresent  state of pressure  on  parliamentary  time, but  nevertheless a ten-dency to be  watched  with misgiving  and carefully  safeguarded.  I feel that in the conditions of the  modern state,  which  not only has  toundertake  immense new social  services,  but  which before  long  may   beresponsible  for  the  greater part  of the industrial and commercial  activitiesof the  country, the practice  of  Parliament  delegating  legislation  and thepower to make  regulations, instead  of  being  grudgingly conceded, ought  tobe widely  extended, and new ways  devised  to  facilitate  the process.  The danger of the  present  method  of  examining  each  piece of  legisla-tion  in  detail,  whether by the  whole House of Commons, or  by  an un-wioldy  Committee  which proceeds on  the cumbrous Commons  method,  is  &quot; Essays in Jurisprudence and Ethics, p. 85.
not that  Parliament has no  time to do its work, but that so much of itstime  is wasted.  While tho farce persists that  each  Member  has the right to  scrutinisethe  details of  Bills, many  of  which  ho  cannot  even  protond  to knowanything about, members of  Parliament are humiliated  by being kept  intho House as mere voting machines, while the experience and  advice theycould, contribute as to tho general plan to bo  pursued by the Governmentof tho day is seldom  utilised.  Parliament  can only  deal  really  effectively  with the  principles  andgeneral plan  of proposed  legislation.   Tho details should  bo  left to the experts.  This  would make  it  possible for tho House of Commons  to discussthoroughly  and  intelligently  tho  broad outlines and enable a  more  realcontrol over the Executive  to be exorcised than can possibly bo the  casewhen Parliament becomes an  obstacle race, the sole duty  of the Oppositionbeing to provide the hedges  and ditches on  tho  course.  In  my  view  it would bo bettor if the Committee stage of  a  Bill, as wonow understand it,  did  not come  before  Parliament at  all.   If  a secondreading debate settled the general  principles  and  approved  the  plan, thedraft could be  handed  over  to the  experts  to settle the details within thatframework,  tho House  giving a further general consideration of  it,  to seethat this had been  dono.  Such  a procedure  would cut out  mere obstruction, and ensure that theBill  really  expressed what  Parliament intended should be enacted.   Itwould prevent  amateur  amendments  being  rushed  into a  Bill, perhapsby  one of  these  emotional  waves  to  which  the  House  of Commons  isnotoriously  subject,  and which  often  cause lengthy  and bitter  litigationwhen the  Act is put into operation.  Where Parliamentary scrutiny  of  detail  is necessary this  could  bo betterdone  by a small committee representative  of  party strength in  the  Com-mons,  sitting with the Departmental  experts  and discussing details fully with them.   At present,  the  Committee is frequently a  farce, because the experts have to sit  silont,  merely advising the  Minister on points.   Thediscussion by  the Members  may  not have  anything  much  to do  with theBill before them, but may be, and quite  often is, obstruction  lifted, fromthe floor  of the House, or  intended  to prevent some  other Bill comingbefore that Committee.  Nothing is so dangerous in a  democracy as  a safeguard  which appearsto be adequate  but is really a fagado.                                                  ELLEX  WILKINSON.                                                      17th  March,  1932.                   FURTHER,  NOTE BY  PROFESSOR LASKI.  With  Miss  Wilkinson&apos;s emphasis  upon  the  desirability  of  delegated legislation as the only way to grapplo with the functions now performed by  modern governments I am  in complete  agreement.   I  think its pro-problems  call  for  a thorough  revision  of  existing  parliamentary  procedure which  was mainly  devised  for a quite different kind of state.   As this is outside our terms of reference,  however,  and  is in itself a separate themeof great  importance, I content  myself with  limiting my agreement hereto the  general  drift of  Miss Wilkinson&apos;s  argument as distinct from  herspecific suggestions.
