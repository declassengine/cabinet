During the past year there has cone to the noticeof  the Admiralty a great deal of evidence indicating theexistence in  the Royal ITavy of a widespread feeling thatcertain cuts  adopted in the Defence Services in 1931?which are in  excess of the general 101 cut in pay made inorder to meet  the financial emergency, havo penalised a largean injustice  exists  is held not only &quot;by the men themselveshut &quot;by  the Flag  and  Commanding Officers and the Officers ofthe Fleet generally-   The men must know that their feeling is shared &quot;by  the officers o     So   The grounds  on  which the feeling is rased may he stated  quite  briefly as followso     3o   As  a result  of  protests that the Economy measuresoriginally announced by the Government did not properlycarry out the principle of -&quot;equality of sacrifice&apos;1? thePrime &quot;Minister made  the following statement on the 2 1stSeptember 1931 in  the  House of Commons          &quot;The Government have?  as announced by me on     Wednesday last? been examining details of the proposed     scheme of reduct ionso   There are undoubtedly classes     of persons  v/ho  are unfairly affected and the Government     have? in view of  all the circumstances? come to the     conclusion  that  the  simplest way of removing just     grievances  is to  limit reductions as regards Teachers?     the Police  and the three Defence Services to not more     than 10%&apos;   This decision will not apply to the higher     ranks of Commissioned Officers of the Defence Services.of the men in the ITavy unfairly.The view that,r,he
     The &quot;balance of  the Budget  will he maintained.&quot;     4*   By this  statement,  it is held,  public faith was committed to the principle of equality of sacrifice  tomeet the financial emergency, and this has &quot;been understoodthroughout  the Tub lie  Service,,     5c   In the case  of  the  Defence  Services,  however,  itv/as subsequently ruled by the Cabinet that the  TimeMinister&apos;s  pledge  limiting reductions to  not more  than 10r&apos;should be regarded as  applying  only for the period of aman&apos;s existing engagemento  On  entering into his secondengagement? he was to  &quot;be  required to  accept, as a matterof contract, the larger reductions in pay and  the  lowerpension scale which  formed part of the original economy measures.     6.   It is this ruling as  applied to the Naval  Rating,which appears to both  officers  and men to be unfair,  because it is inconsistent with the principle of  equality  ofsacrifice to meet  the  financial emergency, in  that,  in fact,it involves reductions in excess  of 10&apos;&quot;&apos;.     7o   As a consequence of this ruling -     (a)  Every man  re-engaging after the 31st  December  1931            is therefore  required to  come on to the  lower            scale  of pay  introduced in 1925 for new  entrants            after  4th  October 1925o     (b)  Every man  re-engaging after the 31st  December  1931            is therefore  required to  accept  the lower scale            of oension  introduced  in 1930  for new entrants  ,-            after 31st  March 1930.     8o   In the case  of  the  Navy,  condition (a) represents a prospoctivo further  cut in  pay,  over and beyond  the 10 percent, mentioned by  the  Prime Minister  as the maximum.   this further cut amounts  to no less  than an additional  10 per centin the case of an  Able Seaman.     9.   Moreover,  as it takes effect on re-engagement,this further cut has the  anomalous result that  every man who                                                  suffers ..oo
s suffers  it will for  a time be  receiving less pay than men  of the  same  rating who  are  junior to  him,  and who  have not yet re-engaged.  It will  he  realised that  in a ship this stato of things must produce very  considerable irritation,     10c  As regards  p.ens.ions9  condition (b) ropresents for the Navy a cut in pension varying  from  25 oer cento  for anAble seaman to 16-17  per cento  for  a Chief  etty Officer..As regards this condition;, the  feeling  in the Navy  isaggravated by the fact that  the enforcement of  a lower  pensionscale on re-ongagoment cannot be explained as a  sacrificecalled for to meet the immediate financial emergency,   ^hesaving to ho realised from it  will not begin to  take effect until the year 194-3 c  It may bo pointed  out that  in  the casesof the policej the higher ranks of  the Civil Service, and theIndian Services, great care has been taken to prevent the10 per cent,  cut in pay  from involving any cut  in pension,and Ministerial speeches have laid great stress on the  factthat there is nc question of pensions being reduced.  Itshould be explained that the cut in pension aoolies to  alarger number of men  than the  cut in pay, since  the men whoentered from the 5th  October 1925 until  the 31st Farch  1930received from en try the 1925 rates of pay, but were originally eligible for the higher rates of pension,     11c  The naval case may be put in a concrete form byconsidering the typical case of an Able  Seaman who entered the Navy prior to the introduction of the lower  scale of payin 1925 but who is still in his first service engagement,          Every such Able Seaman -               has alreo^dy suffered the pay reduction of               10 per cent, mentioned in the Prime Minlater&apos;s               statement of 21st September 1931;               will,  on re-engaging to complete his naval               service, be required to suffer a further pay               reduction of 10 per cent;?

10                will9 on final discharge from the Navy                (some ton to sixteen years hence) he required                to suffer a pension reduction of 25 per cent.      12.   The Admiralty hove considered the whole question very carefully and desire to place before the Cabinet their strong view that the present situation should not be allowed to  continue.      15.   The legal right of the  State to alter conditions of  service when  a new engagement  to serve is being entered into,  cr  indeed  at any time,  is not.  of course,  questioned. It  is  accepted that the State must  have this freedoms and circumstances may arise when it must  be exercised.      14.   In  the Navy?  however? the second engagement cannot he regarded as an entirely separate transaction? since  the possibility of a  second engagement  is  held  out  as an  inducement  for the original engagement?  and no pension can he granted in respect of  the  original engagement  until the second has been  served.   In these  circumstances  any adverse alteration  of a  man&apos;s  conditions  of  service after the complexion of his first period  is  regarded by him as a breach of faith.   This  view  the Admiralty consider justified. They feel  thats  once  the principle  of  equality of sacrifice to  meet the financial emergency was laid  down? and themeasure of sacrifice  to be imposed  on Teachers, police andthe Defence Services  was  declared to be a reduction of notmore than 10 per  cent.?  the State  infringed its own principle by  introducing conditions making it impossible for individual members of the Wavy to continue their service unless  they accepted  a larger measure of sacrifice.     15.  Normally? some 60 per cent, of  the men of the Navyre-engage? and their  first period of service is one ofeducation by which  they  fit themselves  for the higherresponsibilities  that can only be  obtained in the second                                                     period . .
il                                                        5.periods   the prospect  of  attaining theso,  and  also  a pension of known  value when the second period  is completed, is an inducement to them  to  put forward  their best effort whenycungo  It is of cardinal importance that  a sufficient number should re-engage.   The men&apos;s own present  sense ofinjustice is  illustrated  by reluctance, on th6 part ofmany of the beet of them,  to do sc.     16.  The injustice could be removed with very little difficulty or publicity now,.  Although the obligation toaccept the lower scales of pay and pension on re-engagementwill not begin to apply generally  in the Navy until 1stOctober next, it is at this moment that those eligible tore-engage are considering their position..  It is now therefore.that action is essential.-  otherwise, the feeling of hardshipwill develop  and be exploited to the utmost extent by theseditious elements, inside and outside the Service, which arealready at work to subvert Icyalty.     IS.  The Admiralty,  therefore, ask permission immediately to issue the  orders necessary for  the removal of what theystrongly feel is a fair and reasonable cause of a sense of hardship In the Navy.     IS,  The est Mated cost of allowing men to retain their1931 rates of pay, i.e.,  the 1919  rates less 10^, onrc-engagement would &quot;bo only  6,000 in the financial year 1935,and would rise in subsequent years to a peak figure of 83,868 in 1939, after which the cost would fall gradually to 5,242 in 19485   the total cost over the whole 16 yearsamounting to   809,000.,                           (Intld.)
