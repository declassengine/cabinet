FINAL   REPORT.                      I. INTRODUCTORY.               (a) The history  of the investigations.    Immediately on  our appointment in October 1925  we  reviewed the tentative schemes for a barrage across the river Severn whichhad been prepared by various authorities prior to our appointment,and in December of that year we submitted to the Committee of civil research a first interim report,  in  which we  stated that  we were satisfied that a prima facie case had  been established for the further expenditure of  public money in the prosecution of the inquiry.    2.   In order to reduce the risk of incurring  unnecessary expendi-ture,  we recommended that the investigations should be divided intoa  series of stages,  and that  in  the  following  financial yearprovision should  be made  for  the first  stage  to  be  undertaken.This  was to  consist  of  a hydrographic survey  to  be carriedout by  the  Hydrographic  Department  of  the  Admiralty  (on  arepayment basis) of tlie English Stones,  the point of the river Severnwhich appeared to offer  the best site  for a barrage.  Our  secondmain   recommendation  was  that Professor  Gibson,  one  of   ourmembers,  should be invited to  construct a model of the Severnestuary at the  Victoria University, Manchester, and to undertake  aseries of experimental investigations thereon.  We also recommendedthat a preliminary report should be obtained from a leading firm of consulting engineers  on the technical problems  that would requiresolution  if a detailed scheme was  to be prepared for  the constructionof  a   barrage  on   the  river  Severn.    We   estimated   thatthe gross cost of the first stage of the scheme,  which was  designedto cover a period of two  to three years, would amount  to a sum of 28,475.  Of this,  28,400, the estimated cost of the hydrographicsurvey, did not represent an increased  charge on public  funds,  as,though  this sum  was repaid  to the Admiralty, no correspondingaddition  was  made  in   the  sum provided  for  the HydrographicDepartment.   8.   Our recommendations were accepted by His majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  and the work recommended  put in hand.  It was not,  however,until  July 1929 that we  were able to submit a second interim reportgiving the result of the hydrographic survey and of Professor Gibson&apos;sexperiments.   In  that  report  we  summarised our  conclusions  asfollows:-     (i) In view  of  the  report  of the consulting engineers we  are          satisfied  regarding the practicability  of constructing  a          barrage across the Severn estuary at the English Stones.    (ii)  The contour of the bed  of the Severn obtained on the model          without a barrage&quot; coincides  to a remarkable degree with          that  actually disclosed  by  the survey recently carried  out          by the Hydrographer of the  Navy.    (iii)  In view of (ii) above, it is fair to assume  that the  results          obtained by the model can be accepted as giving a  fair          indication of the results that would be  obtained in nature,          and that a barrage :           (a) would  not  injuriously  affect  navigation  below   the                barrage;          (b) would not  seriously affect  navigation above the barrage               at any  time,  and would improve it at  times of  low-               water ;          (c) would  reduce the  effect of inundations in  the upper                estuary due to  floods in the Severn or Wye;          (d) would  not  seriously affect  the  question  of sewage                disposal.   * -It should bo explained that the model constructed by Professor Gibsonwas moulded to the contours known to have existed in 1849, when the Beecheysurvey was made, and that the tides  over the subsequent period of 78 years were then applied to the model.  The consequent alteration of  the banks  andchannels were found to conform very closely to the present contours shown to exist by the survey carried out on our behalf by the Hydrographic Dopartmontof tho  Admiralty  in 1927.
    (iv) The  results of the  first  stage  of the  investigation  amply          warrant  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in authorising the          the second of the proposed stages being put in hand.    (v) It should be possible to complete the  second  stage in about          two years.    4.   We accordingly recommended that His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould  authorise the preparation of a complete  tidal power  scheme with estimates (i) of the  total capital cost on the basis of the dataobtained during the  first stage of the inquiry, (ii) of the total amountof electricity that might be expected to be generated, and  (iii) of the approximate  cost of the electricity.  We further recommended that.Messrs. Coode, Wilson, Mitchell, and Vaughan-Lee, who had prepare the preliminary report referred to  above,  should  be  invited  to actas consulting engineers for the  purpose of carrying out this stage ofthe inquiry.   We estimated that the cost of this  stage would amountto  17,000.    5.   His  Majesty&apos;s Government  approved these  recommendations.Messrs. Coode,  Wilson, Mitchell, and Vaughan-Lee were appointedconsulting engineers, and, in the course of the last three  and a half years,   have devoted  the closest  attention to  the numerous and difficult problems  which the preparation of a complete tidal  powerscheme involved.    6.   The  detailed supervision  of the investigations has been carriedout by  a small  expert co-ordinating sub-committee of our membersconsisting of Sir John   Snell  (Chairman), Vice-Admiral Douglas,Professor  Gibson, and Sir Basil  Mott,  and Mr.  Shirley Hawkins(Secretary).   The work of  the  sub-committee  has been exceedinglyarduous and we desire to take this  opportunity of placing on recordour  appreciation  of the   very  valuable  services  rendered  by  themembers  of  this  sub-committee,  every  one of  whom  has  beenunsparing in the time and trouble which he has given in the considera-tion of  the  many  complex problems presented by  the investigation.In  the  later period, the  sub-committee  have  worked in the closestassociation with the consulting engineers, Messrs. Coode,  Wilson,Mitchell, and Vaughan-Lee.  To the members of  that firm,  and inparticular to Mr. Maurice F. G. Wilson and  Mr. A. T.  Coode, weare deeply indebted for the assistance which they have rendered inconnection with the engineering problems involved.    7.   We have now received from our expert sub-committee a final report  based upon  the scheme  drawn up in conjunction with themby the  consulting engineers.  This,  as a committee, we have carefully considered   and  submit   the   following  report   thereon  for  theconsideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    8.   The  total expenditure of public money actually  incurred onthe investigations during the period of seven years that have elapsed since our appointment amounts to  50,488.   As explained in para-graph 2 above, the sum expended by the Admiralty on the hydrographicsurvey  of the English Stones did not represent an  increased charge on public funds.  The original estimate for this survey proved insufficientand  its cost  amounted to  27,325.   The net expenditure  on  the investigation has therefore been   28,158.                    (b)  Arrangement of report.    !).   We submit with the present  report as an  appendix  the report prepared by  our expert co-ordinating sub-committee, which sets outin considerable detail the character of the proposed barrage scheme.In our  present report, therefore, we do not do more than describe thescheme in broad general  outline  (section II).   In section  III, wedescribe in somewhat  greater detail the  estimate of the cost of thevarious works involved and the  cost of the electricity generated at  atidal power station on the river  Severn.   In  section IV.  we give our appreciation of the merits of the scheme as a whole.  In  section V,we  summarise our principal conclusions.
 II.-DESCRIPTION  OF THE  SEVERN BARRAGE SCHEME.   10.  In  this section  we indicate briefly the  conclusions reached by our expert co-ordinating sub-committee on the various technical questions  that arise in the formulation of a scheme for the construc-tion  of a barrage on the river Severn.                  (a) The best site for a barrage.   11.  Three sites  have been  suggested at different times for abarrage on the river Severn.  A  further examination has been madeof the  geological  characteristics  of  each   of  these  sites.   this examination supports in  every way the conclusion previously reached that, from  the  geological&quot; standpoint,  the most  suitable  site for abarrage would be one  situated  at the  English Stones  on a  lineapproximately parallel to the existing Severn tunnel.      (b) The effect of a barrage  on tidal levels, navigation, &amp;c.   12.  In  accordance with the recommendations contained in our first  interim report,  a large scale tidal model of the Severn estuarywas   constructed  at  the  Victoria  University,  Manchester,  byProfessor  A.  H.  Gibson,  one  of our  members,  who  has madea  special  study  of  the construction  and  operation of  modelsof this type.   In  a  long series  of  experiments,  begun  in 1926,Professor Gibson has examined  on the model  the  effect  of various types of barrage on tidal levels and navigation in the Severn estuary.As a result of these  investigations, Professor Gibson has been  ableto recommend what  type  of barrage  would be  most appropriate  tothe  natural conditions of the estuary.   18.   The  investigations on  the model have  also  shown that&apos; abarrage would not injuriously affect navigation  below the  barrage.Even without dredging,  a barrage  would not  seriously affect naviga-tion  above the barrage at any time of the tide, and would appreciablyimprove   it  at  low  water.  If  a comparatively  small amount  ofdredging  were undertaken, navigation above  the barrage  would beat least  as  good at high  tides  and  very considerably better at allother times.    1-1.   Finally, the experiments show that a barrage would providethe  means of reducing inundation of the upper estuary of the Severnin times  of flood.   This is a very material  consideration,  as floodsin that area are often serious,  and apprehensions have been freelyexpressed that their control would be more difficult if a barrage wasconstructed.(c)  Estimate of the electrical energy that would be available from a                   barrage at the English Stones.    15.   The energy that would be available from a barrage at theEnglish  Stones has  been carefully estimated by Professor Gibson,who has calculated  at half-hourly intervals  from  the  mean tidecurves.   Independent calculations have  been made by Mr. Shirley Hawkins.   These  were  calculated ,a(  intervals  of  fifteen  minutes, representing  approximately a fall  of from three to eight inches per quarter  hour, according to the working head  of the  turbines.  It is satisfactory to  note that the  two sets of calculations,  each  based upon a different approach to the  problem, give almost  identical results regarding the power that  would  be available.     16.  Allowance  has been made  in  these calculations  for  losses due to flow over the English Stones.  Certain assumptions have also been necessary with regard to the maximum output per turbine, the number of  turbines  that would always be available for use, the levels of the English  Stones where the barrage would be situated, and the high-water level in  the basin at Beachley.   On these questions, the assumptions made were as follows :       (i) that  67 turbines of the approved  type would always  be           available for use  (the  scheme provides  for 72  turbines           in all);
    (ii) that  the maximum  output  per  turbine at spring tides would          not exceed approximately  17,000 brake-horse-power;    (iii) that  it would  be necessary to  excavate  the English Stones          to a depth of -8 feet Ordnance Datum* (the average depth          of excavation would be about 6 feet);    (iv) that the high-water  level in the basin at Beachley is +2S feet          O.D. at spring tides, +18 feet O.D.  at  mean tides, and          + 12-5 feet  O.D. at neap  tides.    17.  On  the foregoing  assumptions,  the  output  per tide  inkilowatt-hours would be as  follows:            Spi-ing tides    .........   4,680,000           Mean tides      .........   3,190,000           Neap tides       .........   1,800,000    18.  As there are 706 tides per annum, the total potential output from  the  generators  amounts  to  2,252 million units  per annum.We estimate that some 45  million  units,  i.c,  2  per  cent, of thewhole, would be  required for operating the sluices and for startingup  the turbine sets,  operating cranes, travelling workshops, &amp;c.There would therefore  be, we  estimate, an annual net output  of2,207  million  units available  for  delivery to  the &quot;grid,&quot;  i.c,to the national  system designed by  the Electricity Commission forthe distribution of  electrical  energy from selected centres now  in process of heing constructed by the  Central Electricity  Board.(d) Civil  engineering works and mechanical and  electrical equipment               that would be required for a barrage.    19.  The consulting  engineers, Messrs. Coode,  Wilson, Mitchell,and Vaughan-Lee, to whose appointment on our recommendation werefer  in paragraph  4 above, have  prepared  detailed designs for thecivil engineering works  which would be required.   They have also stated that, in their opinion, the execution  of the works would  cover a period of approximately fifteen years, and have furnished us  witha programme showing  how, in their opinion, the works could best be executed over that period.  In the preparation of their scheme, the engineers  were guided by the consideration that  it was essential thatthe barrage should  be of such a design that it would     (i) enable  the  maximum output of electricity  to be generated          consistent with the economic construction of  the  requisite          sluice and turbine dams, &amp;c.;    (ii) satisfy  navigation  requirements, t.e.,  that  it would include          the necessary  locks, guide  piers,  &amp;c.;    (iii) provide  for  rail and  road cross-river traffic, i.e.. viaducts,          rolling lift bridges, &amp;c.    20.  Subject  to  reservation on  certain minor  points of  detailwhich, in their opinion, require further investigation, the consulting engineers  are of the  opinion that it would be possible to  overcome thetechnical difficulties  involved in the construction of the works.  these would include (a) the  blocking of  the Shoots, which is the name forthe channel, approximately sixty  feet  in depth even at the  lowesttides, which  runs along  the northern edge of the English Stones andin  which  there is   at  times  a  current as much as  12 knots, and(b) the subsequent  construction thereon of  the embankment  dam.The Shoots are approximately 1,200 feet wide at the point where theywould have to be blocked by the embankment dam, the overall lengthof  which  would be  approximately 4,000 ft.   As regards  the  other works, the turbine   dam would have  an overall length of 4,550 feetand the sluice dam  an overall length of 6,825 feet.    21.  The mechanical and electrical equipment that would  borequired have been  fully investigated by the  technical members whoform  our  expert  co-ordinating sub-committee and  by the consulting engineers.   As  a result, a  scheme  satisfactory from the technicalstandpoint has been drawn up.   * ElBowhero in this report wo use  the abbreviation &quot; O.D.&quot; for OrdnanceDatum.
     HI.-ESTIMATE OF  THE  COST  OF THE SCHEME.     (a) Estimate of the cost of the works on the  barrage site.   22.  The barrage scheme contemplates the construction of works which include a tidal power station for the supply of electrical energyto the &quot; grid,&quot; a railway and road bridge, together with the necessarylocks and an impounding basin above the barrage.   In the estimates of cost of the several portions of the proposed works and equipment,an allocation has been  made as between     (i)  the  electrical power  scheme;    (ii)  the  roadway authorities;   (iii)  the  Great  Western Railway Company;   (iv)  the  authority responsible for the operation of the locks and          the regulation of  the  impounding basin.   28.

In the following table  (table 2) we  give  the  estimate  sub-mitted by the engineers,  prepared in the light of normal engineeringexperience, of the rate of expenditure per annum on  the constructionof the various works at  the barrage site,  together  with compoundinterest thereon calculated at 4 per cent.  We have assumed that for works  of such  magnitude and novelty it would  be necessary for thegovernment to give a guarantee in respect  of the power station andfor  the purpose  of calculation we have assumed  the  same  rate ofinterest for the remainder of thel works.  Under present conditions it would seem possible for a long-term loan to be raised under govern-ment guarantee at approximately Si per cent, per  annum; but inthe present case it should  be remembered  that it is estimated  thatit would probably not be  possible to begin the works  before 1987 andthat they  would take fifteen years to complete.  For  this reason andin view of the uncertainty respecting the  future trend of interest rates we have thought it prudent to assume a rate of 4  per  cent.Even so the calculation is necessarily to some extent  speculative.

The  sum of  8,401,749  required in respect of interest falls to be divided among the  several parts of the scheme as follows:                                                              Electrical power scheme   ...     ...    ...  5,128,574      Railways      ...     ............    650,480      Roads..................    561,491      Harbour works      ...    ......    ...  2,066,204   26.  The  total  cost  of the barrage power station  is  therefore- 20,884,000. plus   5,123.500. i.e.,   25,457.500.  (b) Estimate of the cost of the electricity generated at the barrage.   27.  The calculation of  the cost  of electricity  generated at the barrage involves a  number of assumptions.   Of these,  we  havealready referred to the following:      (i)  that  a  period  of fifteen years  would be  required for the          completion of the  works and before electrical energy could   x      be delivered  to the  &quot;grid&quot; (paragraph 24);   (ii)  that the preliminary negotiations and promotion and passage          of a  government  hybrid  bill would mean  that the works          would not be begun  until 1987 (paragraph 24);   (iii)  that it would  be necessary  for the  government to  give  a          guarantee  for the  raising of the capital required for works          of such magnitude and novelty, and that the average rate          of interest with such a guarantee  would  not exceed 4 per          cent, per annum  (paragraph 24);   (iv)  that the net annual  output  from the barrage  of  electrical          energy available to the  &quot;  grid &quot;  would  be 2,207 million          units  (paragraph  18);   (v)  that the expenditure on the construction  of the power scheme          would be spread over a period of fifteen years, and would          be distributed over  each of  those years  in the  manner          indicated in table 2 above  (paragraph 24);   (vi)  that the estimated cost of the power scheme at the barrage          site (t.e., excluding the cost of the road,  railway  and  dock          scheme)  together  with compound  interest  at  4 per cent.          would amount to  25,457,500 (paragraph  26).   28.  In   addition  to  the  foregoing   assumptions,   we   have assumed that  the  loan repayment  period  for  the   various works     I 797*2 i                                                 c
 would be the same as those normally adopted by government depart- ments in similar cases.   On  this basis,  the  repayment period for the permanent civil engineering works  would  be seventy-five years, for the heavy  structural  steel works and the massive  turbines and for heavy machinery, thirty years, and for the electrical machinery and other apparatus, twenty  years.   We  have  assumed that  the movable and wearable parts of the heavy machinery are dealt  with under revenue.  We have also made the appropriate allowance for the annual cost of repairs and maintenance of the  works and plant, for dredging, and management and operation.     29.   On the foregoing assumptions,  the average cost of electrical energy  sent  out  to transmission  lines  would be about  0-18 of a penny per unit.    80.   Under the scheme so far described, the amount of electrical energy derivable from the barrage would be varying  and intermittent, depending on the  tide, unless it were combined with some secondary storage scheme.   Without such  a secondary scheme, it would not be possible to  effect any reduction in  the size and number of the coal-fired  power stations, included in the  &quot;grid&quot; system.   More- over,  steam pressure  would have  to be maintained  in the necessary number of boilers at such power stations, though it would be possible to regulate  the boilers in commission  to  some  extent during the recurring  six and  a  half to  eight-hour periods  during which  the barrage plant would be working.   In these circumstances, no saving in wages, &amp;c,  at any of the  coal-fired stations  could be effected. Thus, the comparison of the cost of the intermittent  supply obtain- able from the barrage  under such a scheme with that of an equivalent supply from a  coal-fired  station could only be based  on the saving of coal that would be effected.    81.  In 1980, the average weight of coal per unit generated at coal- fired stations having an annual output of over 5 million units amounted to T867 lbs. If, however, there was no secondary storage station, the supply of electricity from the  barrage would,  as we have  shown, vary greatly on account of the  tides,  both in the time of day that it would be available and in the amount  generated.  It would therefore not be possible at all times to utilise the supply from the barrage to deal with peak periods of demand, and to meet these it would still be necessary at coal-fired stations to provide for standby  and banking  losses.  These in 1930 amounted to 6  per cent, of the total coal used.  The weight of coal per unit sent to transmission lines at that  date  should therefore for the purposes of the present comparison be reduced to 1&apos;75 lbs.  The average cost of coal per ton in the Midlands district in that year was 11s. 4d., and the equivalent cost of coal per unit sent out, 0-1068 of a penny. In the South-East England and Southern districts the cost of coal was approximately 18s. per ton, and  the equivalent cost per unit sent out  was 0-1688  of  a penny.  Further,  it must certainly  be assumed that when the Central Electricity Board&apos;s  &quot;grid&quot; system is  fully  in commission  the consumption of coal per  unit  will  be substantially lower than it was in 1930.   Thus, the cost of the inter- intermittent  supply  from  the barrage  being about 0-18 of  a penny,it  is clear that,  in the  absence  of a secondary  storage system in connection with the barrage  scheme,  the  electricity  generatedat the  barrage by the primary  tidal turbines could not compete econo-mically with the electricity generated at selected coal-fired stations.The practicability of the whole barrage scheme from the point of viewof cost depends,  therefore,  on  the question whether a secondarystorage system  can be installed at a cost which  would  enable  theelectricity generated by the primary tidal turbines and at the secondarystation to compete successfully with that generated at. the best coal- fired stations.(c) Estimate of the cost of constructing  a  secondary storage station                and of the electricity so  generated.   82.  After consideration of  various alternative sites, it appearsthat storage could  best be provided by  the construction of a high-level reservoir at Trelleck Grange, an elevated valley situated on thewest bank of the river Wye, some  8\ miles north of Beachley point where  the Wye  joins the  Severn.   The barrage plant would be able
to pump water to this secondary station during the operation of the-tidal turbines.  The high-level water so obtained would in turn drivea set of secondary  hydro-electric plant and  thus  provide a  24-hoursupply of electricity.   A reservoir  on this site would have  an areaof about 750  acres, and would contain,  between the  levels of  500and  450 feet  above Ordnance Datum, 58-8 million cubic  yards ofwater having  an effective head above the power house of 440 feet.The  energy stored between  the levels  of 500 and 450 would amountto 20,440,000  horse-power  hours,  and that between 450 and 400,6,466,000 horse-power hours.   Thus, the total energy stored  betweenthe levels of 400 and 500 feet above O.D. would amount to 26,910,000horse-power hours.   88.   After  discussion with  the consulting  engineers,  we  have prepared  the  following preliminary estimate  of   the   cost  of&quot;constructing a secondary storage station at Trelleck Grange (table 8)-                        TABLE 3.Preliminary estimate of cost of secondary storage scheme.

From  such information as is at  present  available, it wouldappear practicable to construct a secondary power station on the riverWye, with a high-level reservoir and works in  connection therewithat a cost not exceeding the figures given in the preceding table.  Inour opinion, the data available regarding the barrage  works and the secondary  storage  station,  summarised  in the present  report, are sufficient to enable His Majesty&apos;s  Government to come to a  conclusions-sion on the general merits of the barrage as a technical scheme.  Inworks of this magnitude, a certain amount  of preliminary work onthe proposed site is always necessary  after  the  decision has  beentaken in principle to proceed with any given scheme.   In the  present case it  would be necessary to make a  further examination of theproposed upland reservoir site,  to select a position and make  boringsto prove the foundations for  the  high-level  dam, to  fix a  site forthe secondary hydro-electric and pumping plant,  to make a  survey,with borings of the route for  the pressure tunnel,  investigate thetidal reach of the Wye, and also make a valuation of  the land to be acquired for the above purpose.  The cost of the survey and  boringswould probably be about  4,000, and would form a part not of thepreliminary investigations  with which we  are concerned but of theactual cost of constructing the  barrage.   In addition,  more  detailed consideration would be necessary  regarding the supply of water tothe pumping plant and the deposition of silt from the tail races ofthe secondary turbine plant.  Information in regard  to these pointscould be obtained by making a small  addition to the existing  Severnmodel at a cost of not more than   200, and having  regard to thesmall outlay  involved we  recommend  that  these investigations  beundertaken while the model is still available.   85.  In the following table  (table  4), we give our  estimate of the-rate  of  expenditure on the  secondary storage station,  together  withcompound interest at 4 per cent, per annum :      [7972]                                              c 2

It  should  be noted  that  a secondary  storage  system hasseveral important advantages.  In the first place it enables the inter-intermittent character of the energy generated at the barrage by the  tidalflow to be converted into a regular supply.  In other words, it provides a method of filling  in the  hiatus which would otherwise exist betweenthe tides.  In the second  place, the amount generated at spring  tidesis far in excess of requirements  for transmission  to  the nationalsystem, and the part not required for this purpose could be used  with greater  advantage  and economy for pumping up the water to thereservoir  at  the secondary storage station.   Thirdly,  it  would bepossible  to deliver direct to lines a larger supply of electrical energyon  neap  tides,  when the  supply  available  would  otherwise be relatively small.    37.   Further, with a secondary storage system the maximum rate at which  energy is  delivered  direct to the national  &apos;&apos; grid&apos;&apos; system is reduced and substantial saving is made in the expenditure on the transmission lines  required to transmit  this energy.   In addition,the energy  obtained from the secondary  storage  station would, aswe  explain  in  paragraph  40  below, be  used to great advantage todeal with  the  peak demands for  electrical energy  in  the country generally,  the  cost  of which  represents by far  the  most  expensivecomponent of the total cost.^d) Estimate of electrical energy available from the combined barrage                   and secondary storage plants.   88.  We have shown in paragraph 18 that the net annual output from  the  barrage would be 2,207 million units.  After allowing forlosses incurred in pumping water to the high level reservoir,  and the subsequent  use  of the  potential  energy  stored  therein  by  the secondary  hydro-electric  plant, the  net  annual  output availableto the  &quot; grid&quot;  would  be  reduced to  1,610 million  units.   Forthe purpose of investigating the problem of storage, the output ofthe primary  turbines  has been  computed  for each  tide  of  a  meanlunar cycle and a  compounded  diagram (see drawing no. 6 in theappendix) shows  the tidal power curve and  the suggested electricaloutput curve with an annual load factor of approximately 34 per cent.Distribution at this uniform load factor would, however,  not be themost economical method of utilising the energ3\  and we have, there-fore, made an  analysis  of the tidal and electrical load, and we find thatthe output from the  combined  stations  could be  used to the best advantage in the grid by employing a combination of load factors.  the resultant  composite load  curve  that has been calculated  shows thatthe scheme will give the following units at the load factors shown:-
                                                Million units                                                per annum.An amount of energy at 84 per cent, load factor   from the primary installation direct into mains  =  420An amount of energy at 10 per cent, load factor   from the primary installation direct into mains  ^  284An amount of energy at 34 per cent, load factor   from the secondary  system direct into mains   -   310An amount of energy at 15/25 per cent, load factor   from the secondary system direct into mains...  =  590                    Total output.........     1,610    89.   From the  above  figures it will  be seen that it  would  be possible to deliver 704 million units per annum direct from the primary- plant and 906 million  units direct from the secondary storage station. Of this energy, 780 million units would be delivered to the lines at the normal load  factor of  84 per  cent.,  and the remainder, representing approximately 9/lCths of the total output, would be utilised at load factors varying from 15 per cent, down to 10 per cent.    40.   A scheme  of operation  of this  type  would present  very material advantages.  Under the existing system, the coal-fired stations of the most efficient type are utilised for transmission of energy at the normal national load factor of 84 per cent.   In order to supply the electrical energy required at the periods of peak demand when the cost of generation is more  than twice that at other times, it is at present necessary to  maintain in existence coal-fired stations working at such low load factors  as .15 per cent., 10 per cent.,  and,  in some cases, even 5 per cent.  The  operation of such  stations is  uneconomical, partly because of the low load factor  employed and  partly  because the stations themselves are not of the most modern type and do not contain the most modern equipment.  The secondary storage station. if established in connection with the barrage scheme, would eliminateprecisely those coal-fired stations which are  most uneconomical  in their working.    41.   The requirements of the whole country in 1941 are estimated to be 21,000  million units, and it  may be  noted  that the proposed scheme  with  its  output of 1,610 million  units  would provide  one- thirteenth  of that  total.   The contemplated station would  have  an effective capacity in  kilowatts  nearly  double  that  of any  station operating in 1932 in this coiynti-y. (e)  The relative  advantages of  the  combined  barrage  and secondary storage scheme with a coal-fired station scheme of equal magnitude.    42.   In paragraph 38  above,  we   have shown that  the  most advantageous scheme of operation would involve the distribution  from the  combined barrage and  secondary storage  plant of 1,610 million units per annum in lieu of the 2,207  million units per annum given in paragraph  18 above. As a result of this reduction, the primary cost at the barrage would be increased from the figure given in paragraph  81 above, namely, 0 -18 of a penny to 0 -2372 of a penny per unit.  On theother hand, the combined barrage plant would no longer be ancillary to the national &quot; grid,&quot; but would  be  incorporated in it.    48.   The average cost of generating electricity at the most efficient coal-fired stations is to-day  8 per kilowatt demanded, plus 0-14 pence per unit.  This is equivalent to 0-875 of a penny  per unit delivered to lines at a load factor of 84 per cent., which is the load factor which it  is hoped will  have been obtained at the date when the  barrage works have been completed.  The difference between the cost at the barrage and this  figure is 0-1878 of a penny per unit in favour of the barrage.  It  should, however, be observed  that though  the cost  of generating electricity at the best coal-fired stations to-day, is as stated-above, 0-875 of a penny per unit, the so-called super (coal-fired) stations now under construction, e.&apos;g., the new  Battorsea works, will  in  time gradually supersede the older types of power station now in operation. These latest stations will, it iB confidently estimated, be able to generate-electricity at &quot;a cost not exceeding 0-8 of  n penny per unit at an annual
 load factor of 84 per cent.  Though it would in any case be necessary to retain some  stations specially to deal with peak loads of demand, which would  therefore work  on a low  annual load factor,  we  have thought it prudent in  the following estimates of costs to  assume that the  cost of electricity generated at the  barrage at almost the sain6 annual load factor would have to  compete with electricity generated at the  same annual load factor by coal-fired stations at a unit  costr not  of  0875  of a penny  (the  lowest price so far recorded), but of 0&apos;8 of a penny, the price  at  which it is  estimated the latest stations will be able to generate electricity. This assumption does not err in generosity to the barrage.    44.   In the consideration of  our scheme  for  the plant  at the barrage site we have calculated that the annual cost would amount to  1,623,869.   This would represent 6-88 per cent, of the  total capital cost.   If, as we think may properly be assumed,  this ratio  between annual  costs and capital expenditure were applied also to the secondary installation, it would be possible on the assumptions given to expend a sum of  14,S00,000 on the secondary station before the  total annual&apos; cost would exceed that of a coal-fired station of the most efficient type producing the same output at the same load factor.   45.   We have  shown in paragraph  35 above that the estimated cost  of  the  construction  of  the  secondary storage system,  plus- compound interest, would amount in round  figures to  11.469,000. There is,  therefore, at this point in  the argument a  balance  in capital  expenditure of  8,881.000  in favour of  the secondary storage- scheme as compared with coal-fired stations of the like size.   46.   There  remains  to be considered  the provision  which would have  to be made for the increased transmission lines that would  be necessary to distribute the load generated at the primary and secondary barrage stations to the areas in which it  could be absorbed.   We are informed  that  the transmission lines  now being constructed by the Central Electricity Board are each designed to transmit 50,000  kilo- watts, but  that these would be  required  almost entirely  for  the distribution of loads between the selected stations already provided. The  total  net electricity  available for  transmission to lines  from the combined  barrage and  secondary station  plant would,  as we have  shown  in  paragraph   38 above,  amount  to  1.610  millionunits per  annum.  In  order to deal with  this  amount,  it would be necessary to provide lines capable of transmitting in the aggregate 550,000 kilowatts.  This  could be done by  the addition to  the existing  system  of  five double circuit  lines, which  would  connect the primary and secondary  power stations  of the barrage to  the Metropolitan.   Central  England,  South  Wales   and   South-WestEngland areas.  This woald entail the construction of some 400 miles of double lines, the capital cost of which, we are advised, would amountto approximately  3 millions. It would not, however, be fair to debitthe combined barrage scheme with the whole cost of these extra trans-mission lines since, as the national load grows and the sites for efficientcoal-fired stations with the necessary condensing water facilities become increasingly difficult to find, extra  transmission lines will have  to be constructed, whether in connection with  further coal-fired  stations or with  the  barrage.   The  sum of   8 millions should, therefore, bereduced by the cost  of the  additional lines which would, in any case,be required in connection with further coal-fired stations.   A careful review of the comparative situations of the various coal-fired stations-loads  us to conclude that a fair  appropriation in respect of the trans-mission lines  required  by  the barrage in  excess of what would berequired for coal-fired stations would be one-half of the total estimatedcost, namely,  1*5 millions.   47.   The total cost of the secondary storage scheme (including thecost of extra transmission lines) would therefore amount to  11,468,901,plus   1,500,000, i.e., in round numbers  18 millions.  The margin inrespect  of  capital expenditure by  which the combined  barrage and secondary  storage  scheme is cheaper than a comparable coal-firedstation  scheme should  therefore  be  reduced  from   8,881,000  to- 1,881,000.   Adopting the same basis for the  ratio between annualcosts  arid capital expenditure for the secondary plant and the  extra
 transmission linos, as we have for the primary plant in paragraph 44-above,  the annual  charges on  the capital  involved  ( 12.968,901) would be  827.416.    48.   We have shown in paragraph 38 above that part of the energy from the barrage  and the secondary station will be sent out at lower load factors than  34 per cent., and the comparative costs have been recalculated to take  account of this factor.  These may now be stated:as follows :     Annual cost of output from coal-fired plant:            c       730  million  units  at  84  per  cent,  load          factor x  0-8(1.............=     913,500       596 million units at  15*25 per  cent,  load          factor x0679d.        .........   =   1,686,000       284  million  units  at  10 per  cent  load          factor x 0-962rf.............=   1,188,500                   Total     .........   =   8,787,000Annual cost of output from the barrage, primary       and secondary stations :    Barrage power station  (paragraph 44) ...     ...   1.623,869   Reservoir and storage  station,  including cost of       extra transmission  lines  (paragraph  47)  ...     827,4162,451,285    49.   Thus there will be an annual saving of  1,285,715 in favour-of  the  tidal  power  scheme,  as compared  with  modern coal-fired stations.  It should,  however, be observed that in the above calcula- tion of the cost of generating electricity at a modern coal-fired station, the  rate assumed for the remuneration of the capital employed is 6-\ per cent., which represents the  maximum rate allowed to under- takings under the Electricity (Supply) Act,  1926 (Second  Schedule). In order to put the relative costs on a strictly comparable  basis, they should be  calculated on  the  assumption that the coal-fired  stations were able to raise their capital at an average rate of 4 per cent., the rate that we have assumed for the barrage scheme.  In that case the  figure  of  8,787,000 which we give above for the annual cost of the barrage output, if produced from  coal-fired stations, would be reduced to  8,540,500, and the annual saving effected by the barrage would accordingly be reduced  to  1,099,215.   50.   The total cost of constructing the power scheme would be :                                                                 Barrage power station (paragraph 26)     ...   25,457,574       Reservoir  and storage station (paragraph 35)   11,468,901       Extra  transmission  lines for  the  &quot; grid &quot;          (paragraph 46)     ............   1,500,00088,426,475    51.  The  complete power scheme could thus he constructed at a-cost of about  38,500,000, exclusive of about  12,000,000 allocated to road, railway, and harbour interests.  As shown above (paragraph 49), the combined barrage and secondary storage  station could produce electrical energy at a cost which would be only two-thirds of the cost of that generated at equivalent coal-fired stations.(1)  Estimate of the employment, direct and  indirect, that would be      afforded  by the construction of a barrage, storage station, and      subsidiary works.    52.   It will be seen from table 2 that the annual  expenditurerises  gradually  until it  reaches  its highest point in the thirteenthyear of construction.  Of  the total expenditure (excluding interest)of   89-5  millions,  the  consulting  engineers  estimate  that theprovision of masonry works,  buildings,  and temporary works would
account for . 28 millions and  that the necessary steel and iron-work,machinery,  electrical  equipment,  and dredging plant,  &amp;c,  wouldaccount for another  14-7  millions.   58.  In the following table (table 5) we give our estimate of thenumbers  of   men  who  would  be  employed  (a)  directly,  and(6) indirectly in each of the fifteen years of construction upon (i) the barrage itself, (ii) the  secondary  storage station (described in para-graphs  82 to 84  above), (iii) the road  and railway viaducts, and(iv) the harbour works.

It  will   be  seen  from  the  above   table  that  the   estimatednumbers  of  men employed  would  be  relatively  small  in  thefirst and  second  years, but that for the next seven years (i.e., inthe  third  to  ninth  years)  the  total  number  employed  would remain fairly steady round about 8,000 men per annum.  Thereafter,the numbers rise rapidly, until in the thirteenth year when the peakis reached, 17,584 men would  be  directly employed on the works and in the engineering shops in Great Britain, while 10,816 wouldbe  employed indirectly in  connection therewith.   The total employ-ment provided by the barrage scheme  in  that year would thereforebe  in  the  region  of 28,000 persons.  The average number  of men employed per annum  throughout  the whole period of fifteen years during which  the  barrage and other works would be under construc-tion would amount to 12,024 men, of whom 7,570 would be employeddirectly and 4,454 indirectly.    54.   A large part  of the employment  afforded by the  scheme would  naturally be at  the  site of the barrage and secondary storagestation, especially in the earlier years.  It will, however, be seen from the following table (table 6) that in the later stages of construc-tion, as planned, very  substantial employment would  be given in the-engineering shops throughout  the  country.

IY.-AN APPRECIATION  OF THE MERITS OF THE SCHEME.   55.  Haying now described  in broad outline  the  main  features of the  suggested  scheme,  we  propose to refer  briefly  to  certainconsiderations of a somewhat wider character than those embracedin the  terms of reference  to our  expert  sub-committee of  which account should, we  think,  be  taken by His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentin coming to a decision on  the merits of the  scheme.   Our terms ofreference are to inquire  into the practicability of a Severn barrage.We have interpreted these  terms as requiring an investigation intothe problem from  the technical  point of  view  and  our report is submitted on that basis.  Such investigation has naturally necessitatedan  inquiry  extending into  questions  arising  directly out  of  thetechnical aspects of  a barrage,  but we are fully  conscious that our examination  alone  does  not  by  any  means answer  the questionwhether there is or is not a case on the broadest grounds of national interest for the construction of the barrage.   We  propose to  indicatebriefly some of the points  which  appear to us  to require  further investigation before  this  question  can be  determined.  It   will  beseen that  some  of the points are of fundamental importance.                 (a) The magnitude of the scheme.   56.   The  first  important  conclusion   that  emerges  from  a consideration  of the scheme  outlined  above is that an electrical power station at the barrage giving only a varying and intermittentsupply  of electrical  energy   would  be definitely  uneconomic  ascompared  with   coal-fired  power stations  of   the  latest  type.The  whole  scheme  therefore  stands  or falls  on  the  constructionof a  secondary  station  for  storage..   The  scheme thus  becomesone  involving  two  entirely  independent   series   of  works,  themain power  station,  situated  on the English  Stones in  the riverSevern and the  storage station, in the  Trelleck Grange area west of the  Wye.   The  total  cost of the power  scheme,  includingcapitalised interest at  4 per cent.,  is  88-4 millions.   Nor is  thisall.  The scheme as at present envisaged and  where so large an expenditure is involved it  seems  essential that every  new  publicfacility which  can be  provided as an  integral part of  the  works should  be embraced  within its scope contemplates not  only  thisoutlay on the  power scheme,  but  also a large simultaneous outlayon the  provision of road, rail,  and harbour facilities.   Expenditureon  these facilities (including  compound interest  at  4  per  cent.)amounts to   12-8 millions.  The total cost of the  whole scheme istherefore slightly over   50 millions.                    (b)  Its composite oharaoter.    57.   It is no doubt  the ease that if  these supplementary works were executed, improved road and rail access would be given betweenthe south and south-west of England and  south Wales, but equallythere is no reason to suppose that if there was no  barrage schemeeither the road  authorities or the  rail authorities would seek  toconstruct a bridge  at the particular  point  across the Severn which,for technical reasons, is  the only one suitable for the construction ofa barrage.  The cost of those parts of the scheme that are attributable to the roads  and railways is substantial,  amounting, after  allowance has been made for compound interest at 4 per cent., respectively to. 2:6 millions and  8 millions.   We have not consulted either  therailway  or roads  authorities  on this matter and  we  are  not in aposition  to  appraise  the value of these  facilities  from  a  transportpoint of view.   As regards the  part of  the  scheme  attributed  toroads, it is possible that  in the case of a new facility of so exceptionala character, Parliament might be disposed to authorise tolls on trafficusing the bridge.    58.   Again, the scheme provides for  the provision of docks andother harbour works at an aggregate cost, including compound interest     [7972]                                               p 2
at 4 per cent.,  of  approximately  6-5 millions.   The site proposed for the  barrage is  technically  within  the  limits  of  the port  ofGloucester, but  neither  that  nor the other  ports  in  the vicinitycould be expected to find so large a sum for  the  provision of docks at this point.  The scheme provides additional deep water facilities which, developed by some further expenditure  upon the  necessarywharves  and  other equipment,  could accommodate  a large  volumeof modern shipping.  It may be  argued that these facilities, togetherwith  a  supply  of  cheap  electricity,  would  lead  to the  establish-ment of  new industrial centres which would create a trade sufficientin itself  to meet the  charges upon the substantial  capital investmentattributed  to the harbour portion of  the  scheme.  Whether such anexpectation would  be well-founded and  how  far  the creation of anew port  above the barrage  would  merely  lead  to a  diversion  ofshipping now using  other  ports  in the Bristol Channel,  we cannotsay, but it is safe  to predict that  for a  considerable period of yearssubstantial losses would be incurred  on  the docks  by whatever bodywas constituted  as  the  harbour authority.   59.   The  foregoing  works,  though   independent of the  powerscheme, form an integral part of the present plan, as, if they were notundertaken,  the cost  of the power scheme would be  materiallyincreased with  the consequent  increase  in  the  cost of electricitygenerated  at the barrage  and a reduction in the  present  estimatedmargin  in favour of  the  barrage station  as compared with coal-firedstations.  It would not, however,  be necessary to add the whole  ofthis additional  cost  to  the power scheme,  as, if  the other  partswere  given up,  substantial economies could be made in  the  present plans.  For instance, the scheme contemplates the provision of threelocks.  One would  certainly be sufficient  to deal with existing traffic,and on  this item  alone  a saving &quot;of  about   -2  millions  could beeffected.   There  would also be some  saving if road and rail facilities were  not provided.   It is, however, important to realise that to theextent to which  there is not  full  economic justification for the costattributed to these  ancillary works, an addition must be made to thereal cost of the  power scheme, thus reducing the surplus  in favourof the barrage.            (c) The technical merits of the power scheme.    60.   The electrical power scheme  briefly described in  the  earlier part, of our report  is the result  of much work and research by ourexpert sub-committee in  conjunction, during  the  later period, withthe consulting engineers.  It is  the first tidal power  scheme of anymagnitude  to  be  investigated in  any part of the  world that has indicated a solution  of  the  highly  complex  technical  problems involved.    61.   The estimates  of cost have  been prepared with the utmosteare by  the consulting  engineers and  the  substantial provision  of12^ per  cent,  has  been  made  to meet possible contingencies  in the-construction of the  barrage.  It is, however, necessary to observe thaton account alike of the  novelty  and magnitude  of the work theremust be  a danger that  the estimates might prove  inadequate  tomeet  the  cost of   overcoming  difficulties which at  present  it  isimpossible to foresee.    62.   It  should  be noted  that once the scheme is  completed, thecost of electricity  produced  by  it will  be  mainly  composed  of theloan charges in  the capital  outlay,  i.e.,  it will  depend  mainly onthe level of values ruling for monies services and commodities overthe period  of  construction.   The  cost of electricity  produced from coal, on  the other hand contains  a large element  dependent  on conditions current  at the time of production  and varying as  those conditions vary.  It may therefore be that the comparison that wehave  made  between the  costs of production of electricity by the twomethods would be  altered either to the advantage or disadvantage of the barrage scheme by a change of values during the period  ofits operation.
          (d)  Other considerations  relevant to the scheme.   03.  In the seven years that have elapsed since our appointment,we have examined  all previous schemes for a Severn barrage, haveselected that which alone  we think is feasible, and, with the fundsplaced at our disposal  and with  the  assistance of the  consulting engineers, have drawn up  the present full-scale  plan, the technicalmerits  of  which  are,  we suggest,  such  as to  merit  the  fullestconsideration.  We have drawn  attention  to  the advantages whicha power station at the barrage would, on the best estimates available,possess over  a comparable coal-fired  power station.   64.  Having  done this,  we  feel that  we have  discharged our terms of reference, and that it is not for us to weigh the advantages of the scheme on the technical side against the risks to which we have referred and  also against considerations, not of a technical character,such as the social,  economic, and industrial reactions of  the  schemeupon the  district, which we  conceive to be outside the scope  of our terms  of reference.
       Y__SUMMARY OF  PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS.   65.  We summarise our principal conclusions as follows:       1.  We are satisfied that the best site for a barrage on the river   Severn would be at the point known  as the English Stones, and   the scheme which  we have  described  contemplates not only the   construction of a power station at the barrage but also that of road   and rail crossings and harbour facilities.   We estimate that a net   annual output of 2,207  million units would be available for  trans-   mission to the &quot;grid&quot;  from a tidal power station  at the barrage   (paragraphs 11-18).      2.  A power station situated  at the barrage would only give a   varying and intermittent supply of electrical energy, depending on   the tides, unless there was  also a secondary station for storage.   Without such a secondary storage scheme,  it would  not be possible   to effect any reduction in the number or size of the coal-fired  power   plants included in the national &quot;grid &quot; system,  and the electrical   energy generated at the barrage could not compete economically   with  that  generated at selected coal-fired  stations (paragraphs   27-31).      3.  From the point of view of cost, therefore, the practicability   of the barrage scheme depends on the question whether a secondary   storage system can be installed at a cost  which would enable the   electricity  generated by the primary  tidal  turbines and  at the   secondary station to be sold at a price less than that generated at the   best coal-fired,sjat^ions.  We are advised that it would be possible tos^*^on!sfrS!r,a*sec?na,ary station, and that after allowance  has been   made for the energy required for pumping the water to the secondary   station, it would be possible to deliver 704  million units per annum   direct from the primary plant and 906 million units direct from the   secondary station,  a total of  1,610 million  units.   Of this energy,   730 million units would be delivered to the &quot;grid&quot; at the normal   load factor of 34 per cent, and the remainder,  representing approxi-   mately 9/16ths of the total output, would be utilised at load factors   varying from 15 to 10 per cent, for supply at periods of peak demand   when at coal-fired stations the cost of generation is more than twice   that at other times  (paragraphs 32-40).      4.  The requirements of the whole country in 1941 are estimated   to be 21,000  million units, and it may  be  noted that the proposed   scheme would provide one-thirteenth of this total.   The contem-   piated station would have an effective capacity nearly double that of   any station operating in 1932 in this country (paragraph 41).      5.  We estimate that the cost of the power scheme, including   the cost of the storage station and the provision of extra transmission   lines for the &quot;grid,&quot; together with compound  interest thereon at   4 per cent,   per  annum  during construction  would  amount to    38,426,475, made up as follows:-                                                               Barrage power station   ......     ,..   25,457,574         Reservoir and storage station  ......   11,468,901         Extra transmission lines for the &quot; grid &quot;    1,500,000                                             38,426,475The soheme on which the above estimates have been compiled con-templates also an  expenditure  (including compound interest) ofabout  12 millions allocated  to neifc  road,  railway, and harbourfacilities (paragraphs 22-26, 35, 46 and 50).    6.  On the basis of these estimates, we have made  a carefulcomparison  of  the  total annual costs at the barrage and at  the secondary  storage  station with  those at a  coal-fired station orstations capable of  producing a like amount of electrical energy atthe same load factors,  and we find that those  at the barrage would amount to  2,451,285 and those at a coal-fired station to  3,737,000.There is, therefore,  a balance of advantage of  1,285,715 per annum in favour of the Severn barrage  scheme.  The cost of power would thus be only two-thirds of the cost of  that generated at equivalentcoal-fired stations (paragraphs 42-51).
   7.   It is estimated that the barrage and other works would takefifteen years to complete and that the number of men employedwould rise gradually from 2,000 in the first year to 12,000 in the tenth  year, thereafter rising rapidly to a maximum of 27,800 in thethirteenth year.  This would represent an average of 12,024 men, ofwhom 7,570 would be employed directly (i.c, on the barrage works and in the engineering works throughout the country) and 4,454indirectly (paragraphs 24 and 52-54).   8.   In coming to a decision whether to proceed or not with theconstruction of a work of such magnitude, many considerations notrfatecjmlcal character, such as the sooial,&quot;economic, and industrialreactions of the scheme upon the district must necessarily arise, but important though they be, they are outside our terms of reference and do not concern us.  Our work was to investigate the technicalpossibilities and merits of a barrage on the Severn,  and from thisangle  we submit this report  for the  earnest consideration of HisMajesty&apos;s Government (paragraphs 55-64).(Signed)J.T.

REPORT.                     I__INTRODUCTORY.              (a)  Composition and terms of reference.    1.  ON the  18th  March,  1926, the  Chairman of the  SevernBarrage Committee appointed an Expert Co-ordinating Sub-Committeeto supervise  the first  stage  of the  investigations  into the  SevernBarrage  scheme recommended in their first report.    2.  The sub-committee is constituted as follows:            Sir   John   Snell,   G.B.E.,   M.Inst.C.E.,  M.I.E.E.              Chairman.           Vice-Admiral  Sir  H.  P. Douglas,  K.C.B.. C.M.G.,C)              Hydrographer of the Navy.           Professor A. H. Gibson. D.Sc\, M.Inst,C.E., M.I.Mech.E.           Sir Basil Mott,  Bt., C.B., F.B.S., M.Inst.C.E.              Mr.  T.  Shirley  Hawkins,  O.B.E.,  M.Inst.C.E.,                 Ministry  of   Transport.    Secretary    to   the                 Sub-Committee.         (b)  History of the sub-committee&apos;s investigations.    3.  On the  21st January,  1928, we  submitted a  first interimreport explaining the stage which our investigations had then reached,and on the 25th March, 1929, we  submitted a second interim reportin which we stated the  conclusions which we had formed on thecompletion of  the  first stage  of  the  investigations.   With  it  wesubmitted  a  preliminary  report  which   had  been  prepared  by messrs. Coode, Wilson, Mitchell, and  Vaughan-Lee, and  a detailedreport on the construction and operation  of the Severn tidal modelprepared by Professor A.  H. Gibson, one of our members.   In oursecond  interim report,  when  summarising  our  conclusions,  weexpressed the view that the work on the model with a barrage erected&amp;t the &quot;  English Stones &quot;  showed that  a barrage     (a) would not injuriously affect navigation  below the barrage;    (b) would not  seriously  affect  navigation  above  the barrage at          any time, and would improve it at times  of low water;    (c) would reduce the  effect of  inundations in the upper estuary          due to floods in  the Severn or Wye.   4.  On the  3rd July,  1929,  the   Severn Barrage Committeesubmitted a second interim report to the Committee of Civil Research,in which they recommended :-     &apos;a) That arrangements  should  be made for the  preparation of a          complete tidal  power  scheme with  estimates            (i) of the  total  capital cost on  the  basis  of  the  data                obtained during the first  stage of the inquiry;           &apos;ii) of the  total amount of electricity  that  might  be                expected  to be generated;          (iii) of the approximate  cost of the electricity.    (b) That  Messrs.  Coode,  Wilson,   Mitchell,  and  Vaughan-Lee          should be. appointed Consulting  Engineers for the purpose          of carrying out  this  stage of the inquiry.    (c) That the necessary  financial provision should  be  made to          enable this stage to be  carried  out in the course of the          next  two years.    (d) That  the  Expert  Co-ordinating Sub-Committee should  be          asked to continue to supervise the investigations, and from          time to  time to report to  the Severn  Barrage Committee          on their  progress.    5.  These  recommendations were   approved  by  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and the funds were provided to enable the second stage ofthe investigations  to proceed.   That stage has now been completed,and we submit  the following report to the  Severn Barrage Committeeon the results  obtained.(l) Appointed December 18, 1928.
                    (o) Arrangement of report.   6.  In  preparing our report  we have  thought it  convenient, inthe first  place, to give  a general survey of the physiographical andother  technical problems raised by  the proposal  to construct abarrage  on  the  river   Severn  (section  II).  In section  III  wedescribe  the  geographical and hydrographical characteristics  of  theriver Severn  and of its tributaries, and  in  section  IV  we  give adescription of the geological character of the possible  sites for sucha barrage.   In section  V we estimate  the  effect which a  barragemight be expected to have on tide levels and on navigation generally,and  in section VI  we give our  calculations  of the electrical  energywhich we anticipate   could  be obtained from  such  a  barrage.Section VII  contains  our recommendations  regarding the  type  ofcivil  engineering works which  would be  required for  a  barrage ifconstructed,  and section VIII,  our  recommendations in  regard  tothe  mechanical and electrical  equipment that  would  be required.In section IX we give our final  estimate of the probable  cost of  thewhole scheme.  In  section X we give a  summai-y of our principalconclusions and recommendations.   7.  We desire to express our indebtedness to  Mr.  Maurice F. G.&quot;Wilson and to Mr.  A.  T. Coode, of Messrs. Coode, Wilson, Mitchell,and  Vaughan-Lee,  who  have attended  all our meetings and havegiven  us  much assistance on many questions in addition  to those on which their firm i-eporled as  consulting engineers  to the scheme.  . 8.  On the geological problems  involved,  the Geological survey of Great Britain have assisted us in every way.   We desire to thankSir  John Flett, F.B.S., the Director-General,  and  his  officers  forthe  help  which they have given us  in this  part of  our  task.  ToMr.  T. A. Peace,  Chief Engineer, Port of Bristol Authority,  we  areindebted for  the silt and other  dredged materials required to enablethe  Severn model to be operated, and to Mr.  A. J. Gullis, Engineer.Sharpness New Docks, and  Gloucester and Birmingham  NavigationCompany, for particulars relating to the&apos; flood levels in the upperportion of the Severn estuary.   9. In the  course  of our   report we refer  to  certain  specialinvestigations which we found it  necessary to undertake in connectionwith electrical  machinery,  turbines,  caissons,  cranes,  and  basinsluices,  and  we  desire to  take this opportunity of thanking  thedistinguished designers and manufacturers whom  we consulted in thisconnection.   10.  Finally, we desire  to  express  our  grateful  thanks  to  oursecretary,  Mr. T.  Shirley Hawkins.   His knowledge  of  the  subject and  the skill and attention which he has devoted  to our inquiry have greatly assisted us  and lessened our  labour.  In particular,  we  areindebted to him for those portions of our report dealing with harbours and  flood prevention, and also for the calculations which he made inregard to the turbines and the flow of water in the river Severn.         a.      II. PHYSIOGRAPHICAL AND OTHER  TECHNICAL                          PROBLEMS.    11.  The  English  Stones site was selected as the most  suitablesite  for  a barrage  by  the  late Sir M.  Fitzmauriee  and Sir JohnPurser Griffith,  and  this  selection was confirmed  in 1929   byMr.   Maurice  Wilson.    In   the  following paragraphs,  we  discusscertain physiographical  and technical matters which we  found itnecessary  to consider in the stage of our investigations,  covered bythe  present report.                   (a)  Physiographioal problems.     12.  The physiographical problems requiring study included  thefollowing:      (1) The  determination of the  volume of  water  available at  all           tides  from   spring   tides  to  neap  tides   and   the           characteristics of the  tidal cycle.   .  (2) The study of the geographical and geological  features of the           bed and  banks of the  estuary and  of the  surrounding           district with a view  to the construction of the necessary           works.
    (3)  The effect of the proposed barrage on  the  regulation of the          water  in the  estuary and  the streams and  waterways          opening into it.    (4)  The  possible modifications  of  the bed and banks due  to          interference with normal currents,  tidal scour, silting, &amp;c.                     (b)  Engineering problems.    13.   Among  the engineering problems involved, we  considered the following :     (1)  The means  for utilising the  intermittent and variable  tidal          output of energy; the question of  storage  with  a view to          obtaining a  continuous output  of  energy;  the  relation          between the maximum tidal output and the capacity  of          the  &quot; grid&quot;   to  absorb  and  distribute  the   electricity          generated;  the transmission from  the  barrage site to the          mainland and the &quot; grid &quot;  system of the maximum amount          of energy generated  at the barrage.    (2)  The cycle  of operation  of the water turbines; the difficulties          arising  from   the   turbines   having  to  work  under  a          constantly varying head of  water; the question whether          single-way or  double-way operation should  be resorted to;          the best form and output of  turbine; and the best design          for the head and tail races and the turbine  setting.    (8)  The effect of wind and waves on the operation of the plant.    (4)  The facility of access to, and the possibility of undue corrosion          by  salt water, of  the turbine working  parts.    (5)  The methods of controlling the  turbines and the sluice gates        .  not only for working, but  for repairs.    (6)  The design of a special 8-pbase  alternator  to avoid the use of          gearing between it and the turbines.    (7)  The utilisation of the power generated and  the possibility  of          its  transmission  over  considerable distances,   say  to          London, the south coast, south Wales, and the Midlands.    (8)  The best  combination  in one  scheme, of  the tidal power          scheme, the  rail and road  connections between South          Wales  and Gloucestershire, and the lock facilities required          to construct a new  harbour  and to  allow  the passage  of          vessels  through the  barrage  for the  purpose of using the          canals,  docks  and  harbours which  already exist, above          its  site.        (c) Commercial, Industrial, and economic questions.    14.  We  considered  also  certain  commercial,  industrial,  and economic  problems, that would be raised  by the construction of a barrage.  These  included the  following:     (1)  The  effect on navigation and the possibility of  creating a port          of first-rate  importance.    (2)  The  improvement of the road and  rail connections between          south Wales and the west  of England.    (3)  The  effect  on the waterway connection between Birmingham          and the Severn.    (4)  The  possible  growth of  the  demand  for  power in a  new          industrial district near the  barrage  and situated between it          and Sharpness, and  also along the  canal  system joining          up  the  Midlands  and  tlje large towns  that  are served          by  it.                    (d)  Public health interests.   15,  The  effect of  a  barrage  on  sewerage,  drainage, trade effluents (if any), water supply, &amp;c, resulting from  the maintenanceof a higher  Jow-water level than exists at present also demanded our consideration.                      (e) Fisheries interests.   16.  We have given some  preliminary consideration also to thequestion of  the  effect  which a barrage  might  have on the  salmonfisheries of  the Wye; and of the effect of holding up  the high-waterlevel to establish the head for the turbines.
III__THE    GEOGRAPHICAL    AND    HYDROGRAPHICAL CHARACTERISTICS  OF THE RIVERS  SEVERN  AND  WYE.    17.  We now give a description of  the  geographical and hydro-graphical characters of  the rivers  Severn and Wye, in the prepara-tion of which we have been assisted by Vice-Admiral Douglas, one ofour members.  A chart of the estuary is  given in the  appendix.drawing no. 2.                       (a) The river Severn.                    (i)  The course of the river.    18.  The river Severn is, in England, second, in length, only tothe Thames.  Its source is in Lat.  520 30&apos; N., Long. 8Q 44&apos; W., nearPlynlimon  on   the  south-western   borders  of  Montgomeryshire,1,500 feet above sea level.  About  11 miles from its source it reachesthe town of Llanidloes, flowing thence  north-eastward by Welshpoolfor the great plain of Shropshire, and  after making a wide circuit,turning  abruptly  south-eastwards  after  a  course of  72  miles,towards the town of Shrewsbury, which it nearly surrounds. In  thesame direction the  river passes Coalbrookedale and  then, flowingmore southerly, Bridgnorth,  Bewdley and Stourport.  At  this pointit  is joined by  the Stour, from the north,  and several  canals fromthe surrounding  trading  towns.  About  18 miles  below  Stourport(i.e., 62-5 miles  from Shrewsbury) it  passes  through the city ofWorcester, enters  the  county  of  Gloucester  at Tewkesbury,   andflowing in  a  south-westerly direction, reaches the second cathedralcity, that of Gloucester, distant 80 miles from Worcester.  BetweenGloucester  and Sharpness the  course of the Severn is very windingand irregular.  About  12 miles below  Gloucester, at Framilode, itreceives the Frome  (or Stroud) from the eastward, and,  making a remarkable horseshoe bend of 9 miles,  it becomes a tidal  estuary of varying breadth for the remainder of its course  to its junction withthe Bristol  Channel  at King Boad, the river Wye flowing into it from the northward about 7  miles above that anchorage.  The totaldistance  to King Boad from  the  source  of the  Severn  is about220 miles.  King Boad  is a temporary but safe anchorage for vesselsbound into the Bristol  docks, which lie on  either side of the mouth of the river Avon.  The estuary of the  Severn forms the &quot;outlet of acatchment  area of about 4,850 square miles having an annual rain-fall of about 86  inches.          (ii)  The  depths of  the  river at  various  points.    19.  The Severn  is navigable  up to Sharpness by vessels which-can enter the docks at that place, namely, vessels of some 4,000 tonsregister.  The  factors  which govern the  size of vessels  are:   thewidth  of entrance, which is  60 feet, and the depth over  the uppersill of  the lock, which is 24-5 feet  at high-water  springs. The longestvessel  that has been docked  at  Sharpness is  the &quot; Seang Bee,&quot;445-5  feet long,  49-1 feet beam,  and 25 foot draught.   One of  thelargest vessels that has been docked is the &quot; Mottisfont,&quot; 400-5  feetlong, 52 feet beam, and 22-6 foot draught.   The channel north-eastward  between   Sharpness   and  Gloucester  is  dangerous   anduncertain, and is only used by small craft at or near springs.  vessels not exceeding 13 feet draught  and 190  feet in length  can, however,normally proceed to Gloucester through the Berkeley and GloucesterShip  Canal.   The  factors which govern  the  size of vessels in  this case are the depth, which is normally 16 feet, from which it seldomvaries more than a few inches, and  the minimum width between  themasonry piers of the smallest bridge, which is 84 feet.   .    20.   The river has been canalised between Gloucester and Stour-port, and vessels up to  250  tons can navigate to Tewkesbury and onto Worcester, a distance of  80 miles, in which length there are  twolocks.   There are large lighter and boat docks  at  Worcester, withample  quayage  and  warehouse   accommodation.    Worcester  isconnected to Birmingham by the Worcester and  Birmingham Canal.Vessels up to 110 tons  can  navigate to Stourport, where they enter the South Staffordshire and East Worcestershire canal system, whichserves Kidderminster and parts of  the  Black country.   Vessels  upto 80  tons can  navigate as  far as Pool Quay,  near Welshpool in
3-2Montgomeryshire,  81-5  miles  above Shrewsbury.   Sailing  vesselsbound  up the Severn for Chepstow,  Lydney or  Sharpness usuallyweigh  from King Road at two hours&apos; flood.  Steam vessels  weighat four to four and a  half hours&apos; flood.   21.  The entrance to the river Severn  lies  between the coastnorthward  of Avonmouth on the south-eastern side, and the coasteastward of Gold Cliff on the north-western  side.   Between a pointsituated near Cross Hands,  about  4-25 miles northward of  Avon-mouth, and  Sudbrook  Point on the opposite coast,  the  entrancecontracts to about 1-75 miles, and it is  here  that  the Great WesternRailway  passes  under  the  bed of the river,  through the .SevernTunnel.   Shoal  ground, which dries at low  water,  extends from a half to ly miles north-westward  from the coast between a  position about  1  mile  northward  of  Avonmouth and the  point  near CrossHands, remarked  on above, and  forms  the  eastern  side  of  the entrance  channel.    The  English  . Stones  occupy  the  northern1-25  miles of this drying bank, and the Dumplings,  with depthsof 1 foot  over  them,  the north-western corner  of this bank.   22.  The eastern  of the  Welsh grounds,  named Bedwin Sands,form the western side of the entrance channel: at the northern  endof  these  sands  are  the  drying ledges,   Black  Bedwins,  Mixons,Gruggy and Lady Bench.  The passage between the English Stoneson  the east, and Black Bedwins, Mixons,  Gruggy and Lady Benchon  the west, is known as the Shoots.   There are depths  of from to 6 fathoms  in the southern  part of the entrance channel,  butfarther northward the  depths  increase, and in  the Shoots,  whichpassage is  only 900 feet wide at the narrowest part, there is a leastdepth  of  6-5  fathoms.  Charston  Rock,  the top of which  seldomcovers and on which  a light tower  has been  constructed, is situatedat the northern end  of the Shoots.  Charston Sands,  which dry,extend north-eastward from Charston Rock  and from the  westernside of the channel.    23. Blackrock is situated on the western or right bank of theriver,  about half  mile  northward of  Sudbrook Point, and about  cables farther  northward is Bed Cliff.   Beachley is situated on theeastern point  of the  entrance to the river  Wye,  about 1-5 miles north-eastward of Red Cliff.  Chapel  Rock, on  which a  light  is established, is situated about 900 feet  southward of this point.   a bank   which dries extends from  600 to 1,500 feet from the riverbank  between Blackrock and the entrance to the river  Wye.   the portion between Red Cliff and the  entrance to the Wye is namedMa them Oaze.    24. The  eastern  side  of  the channel,  northward  of  theDumplings, is formed by Dun Sands,  which dry;  Dun Sands are connected  to the flats which extend southward from Mathern Oazeby  a  bank with depths of  about  1  fathom over  it;  this  bank  is constantly shifting, especially during the  winter months.    25. New Passage is situated on the  left bank of the river Severn,just within the entrance point, and Old Passage is situated on the samebank,  about 1-5 miles  higher  up;  a  steam  ferry  runs  regularlybetween Old Passage and  Beachley during daylight  hours.   AusfCliff is about half a  mile above Old Passage. Northwick Oaze driesoff for a  distance of  about  1,800 feet from  the river  bank betweenNew Passage and  Aust Cliff.                  (iii) The  tides of; the Severn.    26. High water,  full and change, at Severn Bridge is  at about7h. 58m., 1.6.,  forty-eight  minutes later than King Road.   Springtides   rise  80-5 feet, neap  tides  18-5  feet.  The  tides are muchinfluenced by the wind; the flood stream runs for about three hours.Off Aust  Cliff the flood runs at  6  knots  and the ebb 6-5  knots  atspring tides; above Aust Cliff it is of uncertain and unequal rate.    27. At Gloucester it is high water, full and change, about 9h. 45m.,or  Iff  hours later than at Sharpness;  springs rise  about 7  ft.  the duration of the flood  stream  at Gloucester, which is only experiencedfor about four days at the time of full and change,  is about 1 hour,the stream continuing to set up the river 20  minutes after the waterhas commenced falling at Gloucester.  Before the weirs were  con-
structed  the  tide  occasionally  reached  Worcester;  now,  and  atsprings only, it normally reaches the weir  at Tewkesbury, at timesflowing over it.   The  effect of specially  high tides  is,  however,occasionally felt as  far as Upton-on-Severn.                      (iv) The  Severn Bore.   28.  The river Severn is subject to a bore,  which usually beginsat about 2  miles above Sharpness, but it does not form a continuousundulation  from shore to shore  until  about Longley, 9 miles belowGloucester, where it rushes up the river with considerable noise anda front 4 ft. to 5 ft. in height.  It is highest about the 5th flood streamafter the full or change of the moon.   The rate  of the bore at first is8-75 knots, increasing gradually to 14  knots at Rosemary, after whichit decreases. The bore is not  considered dangerous to boats if afloat inthe middle  of the river and it is a common practice to row boats out inthe centre of the river when the  bore approaches, and keep their headon to the wave.  If the boats are in-shore they are liable to be swampedor stove in, as the wave breaks with great violence along the banks, butin the centre, unless obstructed by banks, the wave is a simple undula-tion with a  smooth unbroken surface.                 (b)  The course of the river Wye.   29.  The river Wye rises on the  southern  side of Plynlimon, inMontgomeryshire, about 2 miles S.S.W. from the source of the Severn,and flowing 19 miles  south-eastward  to Rhayader,  from thence runsby Builth to Hay, a distance of 86 miles, forming the boundary betweenRadnorshire and  Brecknockshire.  About 28 miles beyond, it reachesthe city of Hereford,  and, with  a very circuitous course of 26-5 and19 miles, the towns of Ross and Monmouth, respectively.  The river ishere joined by the  Monnow,   having  previously  been  swollen  bynumerous small  tributaries.   Separating  the counties of Monmouthand Gloucester, it flows by Redbrook  and under the Bigsweir Bridge,of 160 ft. span, on to Chepstow, a distance of  18 miles,  passing thefamous ruins of Tintern Abbey, and  between abrupt cliffs and  steepwooded falls.  From  Chepstow to the junction of the river with the severn, the distance is 2 miles and the whole length of the river fromits source to its mouth (where it is three-quarters  of a mile wide) isabout 150 miles.   80.  The tide occasionally  reaches as  far as  Bedbrook,  wherebarges discharge  their cargoes, but boats navigate the river nearly toHay, in Brecknockshire, a  distance of 90 miles.  The estuary of theWye forms the outlet  of a catchment area of  about 1,600 square miles,having an average rainfall  of about  87 inches.  The  river Wye isfamed for its salmon fisheries.             (c) Towns on the rivers Severn and Wye.                           (i) Chepstow.   81.  Chepstow, which is on the right bank of the Wye, has (1981)a population of 4,808,  and is connected with the Midland counties,south Wales, and London by the  Great Western Railway, whichcrosses the river by means of a  bridge, opened  in 1852,  which was designed by Brunei, and combined the  principle of Telford&apos;s  suspension-sion  and Stephenson&apos;s tubular bridges.  The tube which spans the riveris 800 ft. in length and 9 ft. in diameter, with a clear waterway of 51 ft.above the highest  tide, and  94 ft. above low water, the total length ofthe bridge being GOO ft.  The river is also  crossed at the town by aniron  bridge, opened in 1816; this  bridge rests on masonry piers, has a centre arch of 112 ft. span, two arches of 70 ft., two of 84 ft, the totallength of the bridge being 372 ft.   There are iron works for the manu-facture of masts, boilers and bridges and facilities for effecting repairs to hulls and machinery, with sheers said to be capable of lifting 70 tons.There are several paper mills within a short distance of the town.  Newshipbuilding works capable of building steamers up to 700 ft. in lengthwere built in 1921-22, together with shipbuilding berths  at Beachley,     [7972]
on the Gloucestershire side.   These now belong to Messrs. EairfieldAll the works  at Beachley have been demolished and the slips arein disrepair.  This site is now the Beachley Technical School, underthe  War  Department,  where youths are  trained  for all technicalbranches  of the  Army.    32.  There is a depth of about 46 feet in the river to Chepstow at high  water  spring  tides  and  86  feet  at  high  water neap tides.Vessels of 10 or 12-ft. draught can lie afloat near the railway bridgeoff Chepstow;  those of  deeper draught  must lie aground  at lowwater.   There  are several  wharves,   but they  have  fallen  intodisrepair, and, owing  to  silted  mud, there are depths of 9 ft. onlyalongside  at high water  spring tides.  Spring  tides rise 88 ft., neaptides  28 ft.   The tide has.  however, been known to rise as high as 47-25  ft.                     (ii)  Beachley Aiist Cliff.    33.  The channel  between  Aust Cliff  and the point on  whichBeachley stands is less than a mile wide, and at low water it is muchobstructed by rocks; Great Ulverstone, Aust Rock, and Blackstone liewithin 1,650 ft. of Aust Cliff; Lower and Upper  Bench,  and  LearyRock lie in mid-channel,  with  a passage on either side; and Dod, Henand Chickens, and Hyde Bock  lie within 1,200 ft. of the eastern side ofBeachley Point.   84.  Between Aust  Cliff  and Sharpness,  a  distance  of  about] miles,  the river is choked by numerous banks and shelves, whichleave  a  narrow, winding and  shifting channel  between them,  whichnearly dries in  places.  The names of the principal banks, &amp;c, takenin the order from south to north, are Oldbury Sands, Narlwood Rocks.Sbeperdine Sands, Lydney Sand, and Saniger Sand.                          (iii) Sharpness.   85.  Sharpness Wet  Dock, situated on the left bank of the riverSevern, about 8] miles above Aust  Cliff, has an area of 20 acres and12,000 ft. of quayage, with depths of 24  ft. over the upper sill of the entrance lock and in the basin.    86.  The entrance to the dock is through a  tidal  basin and a lock.South pier extends about 700 ft. south-westward from the southern sideof the entrance to the basin; North pier extends  about 450 ft. westwardfrom the northern side of the entrance, and then curves round sharplyto the northward for a further  250 ft.   37.  The entrance to the tidal basin is 60 ft. wide, and  has depthsof 29 ft. over the sill at high-water spring tides.  The tidal  basin itself is 546 ft. long and about 250 ft. wide; it is used as a lock when vesselsexceeding 800 ft. in length are  being docked.   The entrance lock, which lies between the tidal basin and the  wet dock, is 320 ft.  in  length and60 ft. in width.  As stated above, there are depths of  24-5 ft. overthe upper sill.  The lock gates are  open from  1-5 hours before untilhalf an hour after high water.    88.  There is a dry dock at Sharpness, the entrance  to  which is inthe south-western corner of the wet dock; its dimensions are :  length361]- ft., width 50 ft., depth  over sill 15 ft.    Sharpness Docks areequipped with large warehouses and a timber float of  11 acres; there isspecial machinery for  handling grain and several steam  crimes, thelargest being a  80-ton travelling crane.    89.  There is direct communication from all berths, via exchangesidings, with the main line railway system  of the kingdom,  and byroads which connect with the  main arterial roads.  At the  eastern endof the wet dock is a short branch which connects with the Berkeleyand Gloucester Ship Canal.   The  wet  dock has  communication bycanals with  Gloucester,  Birmingham, South  Staffordshire, and theinterior of  the kingdom,  and  is also  connected  with the generalrailway system by means  of the London,  Midland  and Scottish andGreat Western Railways.  A railway bridge 1,887 yards long crossesthe Severn about half a mile above the docks and  directly connectsthem with  the South  Wales  and Forest of Dean  coamolds.
                           (iv)  Lydney.   40.   Lydney, a town and seaport on the right bank of the Severn,is by land 20 miles south-westward of Gloucester and 1\ miles from theriver.  It has a population of 10,054.  The port is connected with the severn and  Wye Bridge  Branch  of  the Great Western  Railway,which  runs through the Forest of Dean,  serving various collieries,iron mines, quarries, &amp;c., and joins the Ross and Monmouth Branchnear the river Wye at Lydbrook.   This railway also crosses  the severn by  the  Severn  Bridge to  Sharpness,  where it joins  theSharpness dock sidings and the  London, Midland and Scottish Rail-way.   The sands off the port dry at four  hours&apos; ebb, and the mainchannel is on the opposite side of  the Severn.  The rapidity of the tidalstream is very great at spring tides, forming a strong eddy near theport.   The port consists of a tidal basin 270 ft. by 75 ft.,  approachedbetween  two piers, of  which the northernmost is 200 ft. in length;and of a lower and upper dock  connected by a canal three-quartersol a mile in length.  The  basin and docks  have an area of nearly4:j- acres and a quayage of 8,820 ft., the outer basin has a  depth of 24  ft.  The  lower docks, 780 ft. by 105 ft.,  and  the  upper,850 ft. by 88 ft,,  are from 12 to  14 ft. in depth;  a canal  8,400  ft.in length, 72 ft.  in width and 12 ft.  in depth connects the twodocks;  vessels,  above 600 tons cannot, however,  be convenientlyaccommodated.  The docks have seven coal staiths, capable togetherof loading 1.000  tons an  hour: also cranes with  lifting power  upto 4 tons.                          (v) Gloucester.   41.   Gloucester, with a population of 52,937, stands on a gentleeminence on the left bank of the Severn, where that river is dividedinto two channels by the Isle of Alney, and crossed by road and railway bridges, the width of the river being about 100 ft; it has been an inlandport for centuries, but only since the opening  of the Gloucester andBerkeley  Canal in 1827 had it become of commercial importance.Technically, the proposed Severn barrage would come within the limits of this port.   42.   One of  the questions  which  would  arise  if the  barragescheme was approved would be to what authority should be entrustedthe jurisdiction of the port which would grow up at the barrage site.Existing possible  authorities are the ports of Gloucester and  bristol and the Great Western Railway Company, which owns all  the largesouth Wales ports.  This is not  a question on which we are speciallyqualified to express an opinion, but we imagine that with the prospectof an important port developing  at this place, Parliament would pro-bably consider it desirable to set up a special ad-hoc harbour authority,composed of representatives of  government  departments and other interests concerned.                      (d) Canals and docks.              (i)  The Gloucester and Berkeley Canal.   43.   The length of  the  Gloucester and  Berkeley  Canal, whichin some  places runs alongside  the banks  of  the river, is  16 miler6 furlongs from  the City  of Gloucester to Sharpness Point, of  anaverage width of 90 ft.,  and with a normal depth of 16  ft., fromwhich  it  seldom varies more than two or three inches.  The  largestvessels that can ply through it  cannot exceed 240 ft.  in  length and82 ft.  6 in. beam, and  a draught of 18 ft. 8 in., provided  they aretowed by one of the  company&apos;s tugs.  Steamers of less than 800 tonsregister and not exceeding 180 ft. in length between  perpendiculars,are allowed to navigate  the canal during  daylight  under their ownsteam.   44.   The number of bridges over the canal between the Sharpnessentrance and Gloucester is 19,  inclusive  of  the  low and high-levelbridges at Sharpness Dock and the Severn Bridge carrying the main railway line across  the Severn.  They vary in width, the minimumbeing 84 ft. between the  masonry piers.   45.  There is a  tidal basin and lock at Sharpness  Point, whichat one time served  as the entrance to the canal, but  the  entrancenow used is through the wet dock, as mentioned above.  From theSharpness  Docks,  the canal is entered without a lock, and there isno lock between this point and the docks at Gloucester.    [7972]                                               P 2
 IY.-DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  GEOLOGICAL  CHARACTER-    ISTICS OF THE POSSIBLE SITES FOR A BARRAGE.   49.  In the  following paragraphs based on a report prepared  inOctober 1924 by Sir John Flett. F.R.S.,  the Director-General of the geological  Survey,  and Mr.  T.  C.  Cantrill,  B.Sc,  we  give  adescription of the geological conditions at the various possible sites for a barrage.                     (a) The  English Stones.   50.  The most suitable  site  from  the geological point of view is   a   line  across  the   Severn  approximately  parallel  to  the severn  Tunnel.   \t  this point the surface examination  shows theEnglish Stones  are made up of  Triassic  sandstone and marl.   Thesandstone  is a  fairly  strong rock and is open  to the examinationof the engineers,  who can  satisfy themselves  whether it  is a satis-factory  foundation for the  type  of structure they  propose.   the-in.  maps indicate two  areas  at the east end which  are  not dry  atlow water,  but Section 1A of the Admiralty soundings shows no depthgreater  than 1  ft. (i.e., 20-5 ft.  below Ordnance Datum(2)), so thatat low water of spring tides Section 1A  is practically diy from theeastern  shore to the east  side of  theVShoots, and there should beno real  difficulty in  examining the rocks.   51.  A map prepared by Mr.  Dixon indicates a north and southfault  about  1  mile  distant  from  the  eastern  shore.   This  ispresumably the  fault  traversed by the tunnel.  The beds are slightlybent near this fault, but there  is  no reason to expect an open fissure,and the fault-line should  be easily open to inspection.   52.  The thickness  of  the Triassic  sandstone  of  the EnglishStones  is  not everywhere  known,  but  Messrs. Cantrill and Dixon&apos;sreport gives a journal of a trial  bore at  Old Man&apos;s Head on the   (2)  Levels throughout the  report  are referred  to the Liverpool  OrdnanceDatum.  The Admiralty surveys referred to in this  section arc those  of 1840carried out  by Captain Deechey,  R.N., C.B., F.B.S.                (ii)  The  Severn Navigation Canals.    46.   The Severn Navigation Canals connect with the Gloucesterand Berkeley and run from Gloucester to Worcester, a distance of80 miles.  There  this  canal  joins  at Diglis Junction  with  theWorcester and  Birmingham Canal.  This length is capable of takingvessels  185 ft.  long, a width of 17  ft.  6 in., and a draught of 8-9 ft.From  Worcester,  where it  joins  up with  the  Worcester  and birmingham Canal,  which has  a length of 80 miles from Worcesterinto Birmingham, this length  is capable of taking craft  71 ft. 6 in.long, 7  ft. wide, with a draught of 4 ft.  and a headroom limit of 9 ft.                  (iii) 77ic Gloucester  Wet Docks.    47.   The Gloucester  Wet  Docks  are  connected with  line  ofrailway so that vessels can discharge either direct into trucks or intothe warehouses alongside.  They have  an  area  of 14 acres and are connected  with  the  river by a  small lock  150 ft. long,  22  ft.  6 in.wide, and with a depth over sill of 10 ft. for the passage of rivercraft only.  There are cranes with  lifting power  up  to 10 tons.  Thelargest vessel using  the docks is one of 896 tons register.                     (iv) The  Port of Bristol.    48.   The port and harbour of Bristol  is bounded on  the  southin  part,  by an   imaginary straight  line drawn from Clevedon  PierHead to the north-eastern corner of Queen Alexandra Dock, Cardiff,on the north-west in part by an imaginary straight line  drawn fromMonkstone  Lighthouse to Denny Island Beacon, and  thence  to thepoint on Chittening Wharf, in the county of Gloucester, at whichhigh-water  mark of  mean spring tides is intersected by  the parallelof  51&quot; 82&apos;  80&quot;  N.   On  the  remaining side, the  boundary  is  theGloucestershire  shore.
west margin of the English Stones.  This shows alternating beds ofsandstone and  marl to a  depth  of 35  ft. resting on Pennant Grit.The  character of the Triassic marls can  be determined by examina-tion  of Aust Cliff or Sedbury Cliff.  They are sometimes sandy, butas a whole are fairly compact and  firm, and there  is no reason tosuspect  that they  are pervious  to water.   53.  The  Shoots along this  line of section are  about 1,300  ft.wide and have  a depth in places of 120  ft. below Ordnance Datum.Pennant Rock  is  exposed on  their western  side (on Lady Bench)underlying Triassic dolomitic conglomerate, and the  evidence of thebore already quoted is sufficient to  show that the great  part of theShoots must be in the Pennant  Rock.  The  characters of this rockmay be  seen in the specimens on the shore near the pumping station at Sudbrook, where the rock taken from the tunnel is dumped.  Itis a firm dark grey, compact, hard, massive sandstone.  We considerit likely that there  is little superficial deposit anywhere in the Shoots.   54.  On the west side  of the  Shoots, on Lady Bench,  Mr. Dixonfinds Triassic sandstone on dolomitic conglomerate, on Pennant Rock,and  Lady Bench is accessible and open to examination at low water.   55.  Between Lady Bench and  the western bank of  the  Severnthere is a shallow  channel shown by the Admiralty survey as 24 ft.below Ordnance Datum,  and  it may  be necessary to make someexamination of the nature of the ground at  this place.                   (b)  Aust Rock to Beachley.   56.  The line across the Severn from Aust Rock  to  Beachleypresents considerable difficulties.   On the east side Aust Rock consists of Triassic marl resting on dolomitie carboniferous limestone.  Themarl is probably only a few feet  thick and the limestone is exposedat the western edge  of Aust Rock  and can be thoroughly examined.   57.  Across the river  from Aust  Rock to Dod Rock only lime-stone has  been found, and the presumption is strong that the wholechannel in this part is in  limestone.   58.  The reefs  of  Great Ulverstone,  Little  Dlverstone,  LearyRock,  Upper  Bench and  Lower Bench have been examined andhave  proved to be all limestone.   They are  exposed only  afterhalf-ebb.   59.  The characters  of this limestone may be seen at Aust Rock,at Beachley Point and in many places near Chepstow.  It is generallydolomitic  and is  then compact  and  traversed by  white crystallineveins.  It is much  jointed,  but  the cracks as a rule are not open.It is not cavernous  and  though by no means impermeable  (owing toits jointing) it is sufficiently  strong to bear a  considerable weight.   60.  The original Admiralty  fair chart  shows a deep channelabout 2,000 ft.  west  of Aust Cliff.  The bottom of this  is  69  ft.below Ordnance Datum.  It lies between Great Ulverstone and LowerBench.  We think  it probable that this is wholly  in limestone, andas the current is 5-7 knots  it is quite possible that there is littlesand or gravel in the channel, but if the engineers propose to followthis  line these matters  may require further  investigation.   61.  West of  Upper Bench and Lower  Bench there is shallowwater, but  we have  no  information as to  the  character  of  the bottom.   Further  west is another  deep  passage in which  depthsof 52 ft, below Ordnance Datum  are recorded.  This also is probably in limestone and the current has a velocity of 6-8 knots.  Conse-quently, there  is likely to be little deposit in this channel,  but  noactual observations  have yet been made on  this point.  From DodRock to the west bank  of the Severn there are abundant  exposuresof carboniferous limestone.   62.  Before structural plans  could  be  drafted for  works alongthis  line,  investigation of both of the deep channels and the shallowwater between them would be necessary.
               (c) Oldbury Sands to Pillhouse Rooks.    03.   The third iine across the Severn that has  received special consideration  is  one  running across  Oldbury Sands to  PillhouseRocks or to Sedbury Cliff 1 mile further south.    64.   The  Admiralty  Survey shows that practically the  wholesurface is accessible at  low water  (20 ft. or less below  OrdnanceDatum), except a passage about, 600 ft. from the west bank of the severn,  where depths of 40 ft.  below Ordnance  Datum have  been recorded.    65.   On Oldbury Sands, Captain Beechey&apos;s borings proved rockin many places at depths up to about 30 ft. below Ordnance Datum.but at other places only sand was found  to that depth and the true position of the top of the underlying rock is not known.  Such rockas is  exposed (on Cloudsmoor Rocks) is Triassic sandstone and marl,and a section  prepared by Mr. Dixon indicates his belief that rocksof this nature  underlie  the  whole  of Oidbury  Sands  and acrossfrom  shore to  shore.   66.   If this line should be selected it would be necessary to prove the depth to rock  across the whole estuary at distances of 100 yardsor so.  Mr. Dixon and  Mr. Cantrill think the maximum  depth torock  may not  be  more than  65 ft.  below Ordnance Datum.   Anyborings in Oldbury Sands should be  carried  into  rock to a  depth of10 or  15 ft. to prove the character of the substratum.   67.   The further  possibility must be considered  that a  deepburied old river channel may exist more or less completely occupiedby gravel, sand and mud.   68.  The Severn Tunnel  proves that along  that  line   there issolid  rock at a  depth not  greater than 100 ft. below  low-water mark of Spring tides, and  it is  not probable that further  up the estuaryany buried  channel of greater depth  than  this  can occur.  It ispossible, however, that some of the deep channels (e.g., the Shoots)occupy  the  line  of  some  old  channels easily  cleared  out by  thecurrents.   69.  Prom what  we know of south Wales  (Barry, &amp;c),  there are indications that the land at one time  stood  55 ft.  higher than atpresent [Cardiff Memoir,  edition 2,  1912, p. 90).  Channels 70  ft.below Ordnance Datum might  consequently  have been formed,  butthere  is no actual evidence of such channels in the Severn estuary.This  figure consequently  must be taken as an estimate rather  thana statement of  actual fact.   70.  Especially on Oldbury  Sands this possibility must be kept in mind.   Such  a channel would be at  least 100 yards wide andborings 100 yards  apart might be expected to indicate its position.  Y THE  EFFECT OF A  BARRAGE  ON TIDAL LEYELS,                       NAVIGATION, &amp;c.   71.  As soon as  the English Stones was selected as the site forthe barrage,  the  first point for consideration  was  the  effect  of  abarrage on the  tidal levels,  on silfetion both above and below  the barrage,  and  on  navigation  generally.   A  full  report has beenprepared by Professor Gibson on the working of  the model of the severn estuary.  The main points are  summarised in  the  following paragraphs.  In addition, there are certain secondary questions suchas the effect on flood levels, land drainage and sewerage, on  which wehave  been advised by Mr.  Shirley Hawkins.            (a)  The effect of a barrage on tidal levels.   72.  The  model  experiments, which were begun in 1926, show-that the tidal levels would be altered by the construction of a barrage.Tho effect, especially on the levels of low water in  the basin, depends upon  the exact scheme of operation of the turbines.   73.  The  following table (table 1) gives  the tide levels referredto Liverpool  Ordnance Datum at present existing,  i.e., without  a

In the following table (table 2), which has been prepared byProfessor  Gibson,  we  give  the high  and low-water levels referred  toLiverpool  Ordnance Datum  obtained on the model with a  barrageplaced on the  site  selected,  viz., the English  Stones,  and with thescheme of operation which would, in our view, give the best all roundresults.   (-&apos;) The data for Avonmouth depend on a long series of tidal observations andmay be accepted  as correct  average data referring to  a state of normal riverdisoliarge.  The  aggregate length of  observations  at Beachley, made up of  anumber of  shorter periods,  was about 6 months; at  Sheperdine and  severn bridge about 15 days&apos; observations were available; data for these places havebeen computed  by comparing those  derived from  the  observations with thosederived from corresponding  tides at Avonmouth and  adjusting to the averageAvonmouth data.  Observations were not obtained at No. 1 Beacon,  and datafor  this station  have been obtained  by interpolation between  Avonmouth andNew Passage.  The Framilodc  and Gloucester levels depend on a few observa-tions, obtained at spring and neap tides only.barrage.   It has  been  prepared by  the Hydrographer of the Navyon  the basis of special  observations  carried  out  for  the purpose. (3)The levels given  refer to a  state  of  normal river  discharge.

It will be seen from the above table that the model shows thatthe period of the flood tide is lengthened, and that of the ebb tide isshortened, by the introduction of the barrage, the effect at Avonmouthbeing 24 minutes at  springs, 18 minutes at means, and 5 minutes atneaps.  Taking the times under existing conditions as those given bythe Hydrographer, the times as modified by the barrage would be  as given above  (table 2).   76.   These tables also show that under present conditions the spring tides  at the barrage site take 5  hours 2  minutes rising  and7  hours 15  minutes falling, the  mean tides  5  hours  80  minutesrising and 6 hours 54 minutes  falling,  and neap  tides  take 6 hours20 minutes rising and  6 hours 26  minutes falling.  The duration of the tides  are :  springs, 12 hours 17  minutes; means,  12 hours24 minutes;  and  neaps, 12  hours 46 minutes.   The  range of thetide is:  springs, 40-60 ft.:  means, 32-60 ft.;  and  neaps, 22-20 ft.   77.  After the construction of the barrage across  the estuary, the spring tides at the barrage site would take 5 hours 81 minutes risingand 6 hours 46 minutes falling, the mean tides 5 hours  58  minutesrising  and  6  hours  81  minutes  falling, and  neap tides  6  hours27  minutes  rising  and  6  hours  19 minutes  falling.   The  totalduration of the tides would, of course,  remain the  same as  before,i.e., 12  hours 17 minutes  for springs,  12 hours  24  minutes formeans,  and 12 hours 46 minutes for neaps.  The range of  the tideswould, however, be slightly altered  if there was  a  barrage, and wouldbe 40-60 ft. on springs, 82 ft. on means, and 21-40  ft.  on neaps.(b) The effect of a  barrage on the amount of tidal water passing up             the Severn, with, and without, a barrage.   78.   The amount of tidal water passing up the Severn above the barrage  site  under  natural   conditions  is  estimated  to  be  about.24,500 million  cubic ft.  per tide at mean  spring tides,  19,500 million cubic  ft. at mean tides, and  about 12,800 million  cubic ft.  at  neap.tides.
   79.  The areas of the water plane surface above the barrage at hightide levels and at the level to which the basin is lowered by the turbineson the various tides,  under the  scheme of operations which we  pro-visionally recommend, are as follows :                                                 Square miles.         M.H.W.S.  + 2S   ft.  O.D.......    34-9         M.H.W.    +17-7 ft.  O.D.......    33-45         M.H.W.N.  +11-6 ft.  O.D.......    29-06         M.L.W.N.  4-  2-2 ft.  O.D.......    22-36         M.L.W.    -i-  4-2 ft.  O.D.......    24-5         M.L.W.S.  -t-  9-1 ft.  O.D.......    27-88   80.   The construction of a barrage would considerably lessen theamount of tidal water that would flow down to  the Bristol Channelfrom the  Severn on a tide.  With the foregoing water levels in thebasin above  the turbines,  the discharge to the lower estuary wouldbe reduced  to 12,506  million  cubic ft.  per  tide  on springs,  to11,817 million cubic  ft. per  tide on means,  and to 7,680 million cubic ft.  per tide on neaps.  This compares with  the present naturaldischarge  of  24,500 million  cubic  ft,  per  tide  on  springs,  of19,500 million cubic  ft. per tide on means, and of 12,800 million cubic ft. per tide on neaps.   81.   The foregoing  figures represent  the actual amount  of tidalinterference, i.e.,  the  difference between  the  unrestricted  naturaltidal flow and the amount  of water  discharged by the turbines,  plus the small amount that  will be.  used  for passing  ships  up and down the river through  the locks.             (c) The effect of a barrage on navigation.   82.  The question of navigation up to and through the locks is oneof importance, for ships approaching might experience a considerablecioss current due to the  water entering  the basin  sluices.   Inaddition, there is the question of the effect on chips when enteringor leaving the locks  due to the discharge from the turbines.   83.  As regards  ships  approaching  the  barrage, the  strengthof the inflowing  current would not  be great  in the main  navigablechannel, and all that appears necessary is that ordinary seamanlikeprecautions should be taken in navigating this area.  Prom experi-ments made on  the  model  it  has  been  found that the  maximumstrength of the flow at spring tides at a distance of 400 yds. in front ofthe sluice gates is 3-8 knots.   84.  The effect of the discharge from the turbines can be  gotover by arranging for suitable  &apos;&apos; locking times&apos;&apos; for the entry and leaving of ships, and by  the provision  of guide  piers  at the  lockentrances.   85.  The  following data  make  the  above conclusions clearer.The basin sluices would be opened and allow the tide to fill  the upperestuary, from  approximately    2 hrs. 54 mins. after low water  at Avonmouth(&apos;) on  spring tides       until 9 mins. after high water, a period  of 2 hrs. 58 mins.    8 hrs. 6 mins. after low water on mean tides until 11 mins. after       high water, a  period of 8 hrs. 5 mins.    3 hrs. 18 mins. after low water on neap tides until 18 mins, after       high water, a period  of 8 hrs. 84 mins.   86.  The turbines would begin working and discharge  the waterfrom the upper basin at     1 hr.  18 mins. after high water at  Avonmouth on  spring tides,       and continue for 7 hrs. 50 mins.    1 hr. 29 mins. after high water on mean tides, and continue for       7 hrs.  21 mins.    I hr. 45 mins. after high  water on neap tides, and continue for       6 hrs.  30 mins.   (*) High water and low water at the site  ol the barrage are  respectivelyabout 3 miiis. later and 10 mins.  later than at. Avoumoutb,[7972]
    87.   It will  be seen  from the  above that all locking in and out of  the basin  can take  place  from  about  2  hrs.  before  highwater on every tide, i.e., directly there is sufficient  depth of  waterover the  sills  to  pass shipping, and  bo  continued for  a  periodextending  until 1-5 hrs. after high water, which gives ample lockingtime, for  this would  cover  what should  be the busiest time, i.c,2  hrs.  before  high water until  1  hr.  after high  water.   If  shipscomply with these  regulations, navigation could be  easily accomp-lished past the  basin sluices,  and  there would  be  no danger  of interference  from the  turbine discharges.    88.   It may be urged from a  shipping  point  of  view  that thelimitation of &quot; locking &quot; times is open to  objection on the grounds thatboats and  barges will be handicapped and delayed and their businessinjured by such a restriction.  It should, however, be  rememberedthat sailing vessels bound for  Chepstow, Lydney  or  Sharpness,  in existing circumstances (?.c,  with no barrage)  usually  weigh   fromKing Road at 2 hrs. flood, so that if 2 hrs. before high water is fixedas  the  time  for  locking,  they would arrive at  the locks from  KingRoad just about the time the  caissons would be ready to open.  So laras  they  are concerned, there would, in effect,  be no change  fromthe  present practice beyond  the delay of passing  through the lock.They would,  however, have the  advantage that  they would nolonger have to  make the difficult passage through the Shoots with itshigh tidal stream velocities.    89.   Steamships usually  weigh from King Road at 4 to 4-J- hrs.flood, so that,  if they continue to do so, the time for locking wouldbe  limited to about 1-5 to 2 hrs.   There is no reason,  however, if and when  a barrage were constructed,  why  they  should not weighan  hour or so earlier, for then there  would not be  the navigationdifficulty  to large  ships caused  by the  high velocity of the  waterthrough the  Shoots  that exists  to-day.   So far,  therefore,  assteamships are concerned, their  difficulties would  be lessened and&apos;they would gain 1^ to  2 hrs. on  their time for weighing from  KingRoad.  Once ships, both sailing and steam,  have passed the locks,they should  be  able to make better times up  the river,  for  theywould always  have  more water at low water  than  in existingcircumstances  and a smaller current to  stem,  especially  at springtides.  We estimate that the  low-water level at Severn Bridge wouldbe  raised approximately as follows :        10-5 ft., i.e., to a level of -f 7-1 ft. O.D. on a spring tide.        7-5 ft., i.e., to a level of + 8-8 ft. O.D. on a mean tide.        7-8 ft., i.e., to a level of + 2-1 ft. O.D. on a neap tide.    90.   There would be a minimum depth of water of 15 ft. in thenavigable  channel  between the barrage and  Sharpness  even in theleast favourable  conditions,  i.e.,  at low water  of  neap  tides.   this compares with a minimum depth of approximately 4 ft. in existing conditions.    91.   The range of the tides would also be considerably reduced bya barrage.  These reductions  at three points at spring and neap tidesare as follows :         Severn  Bridge  at springs  from 28-9 ft. to 18-1 ft.        Sheperdine at springs from  86-8 ft. to  14-2 ft.        Beachley at springs from  41-0 ft. to 14-8 ft.        Severn Bridge  at neaps from 18-6 ft. to 11-5 ft.        Sheperdine at neaps  from 22-5  ft. to 10-2 ft.        Beachley at neaps from 22-8 ft. to 10-1 ft.We anticipate  that objections may be raised to the scheme by dockauthorities,  e.g.,  those  at   Lydney,  Sharpness  (Severn  Bridge).Gloucester and Chepstow, on account of the lockage  dues  to be levied,and in regard to the question  whether the advantages obtained will becommensurate and as to what would be the ultimate effect of these dueson  transport costs generally.      (d)  The effect of a barrage  on siltatlon in  the tidal basin.    92.   The experiments on  the tidal model show that the  introduction-of a barrage increases the siltation in the tidal basin by approximately*K)0,000 cubic yards per annum during the first 20 years of operation,
 but that after this the rate of deposition is considerably reduced.   Much of the silt deposit occurs on the banks and in parts of the basin remote from the navigable channel, and observations on the model show that the  dredging,  during  this  period,  of  an  amount,   conservatively estimated at 600,000 cubic yards per annum, would enable the  whole bed  of the navigable channel between Beachley and Sharpness to  be maintained at its existing level.    98.   As a large part of the silt  in suspension at any time in the tidal basin has been brought in by the heavily silt-laden waters from the lower estuary in the vicinity of Avonmouth, we consider that the removal by dredging from the tidal basin would ultimately result in a reduction of the silt deposits in the neighbourhood of Avonmouth, and a consequent  reduction in the  amount  of dredging required in this region.    94.   The model experiments  also show  that  even without any dredging around Avonmouth, and in spite of the introduction in the- experiments of much excess silt between Avonmouth and the Shoots, the depth of the channel at Avonmouth is somewhat greater with than without a barrage.            (e) The effect of a barrage on land drainage.    95.   Although  the  low-water  levels  in the river  would be per- manently higher after the construction of  a barrage, it is considered that the level to which the basin would  be ebbed on each tide  would prove sufficient to  ensure  adequate  drainage  for all ditches, brooks, streams, &amp;c, that now find an exit into  the Severn below  Framilode. Above this point the existing regime of the river would not be altered under conditions of normal  river flow  except to  lower slightly the height to which spring, mean,  and neap tides rise.              (f)  The effect of a barrage on sewerage.   96.   So far as can be ascertained without consulting the local authorities, the various towns between the barrage site  and Gloucester discharge their sewerage into the river in its crude state, but owing to the  large volume of sea water that is  admitted on everyr tide, the volume  of sewerage at present put  into the river is.negligible.   97.   As regards the effect which the higher low-water  level may have on the outfalls generally,  so far as at present known the only doubtful outfall is that at Lydney,  for we are given to understand that this  has a  gradient of only 1 in 900, and  it has been  suggested that some retardation of flow might take place.   We have not investigated this further, but it will be seen from the  Ordnance Sheet that Lydney is situated  at a level of about -)- 84 feet O.D., and as the highest low- water that would normally affect this place will be about -t- 7-8 feet, i.er,  on springs it does  not  appear that this need  be  taken too seriously, for Lydney is some 7,700 ft. from the river,  and if we take 70 ft. as available fall, the hydraulic gradient works out at 1 in 110.   98.  The chief villages and towns are,  however, all above Sharp- ness and, as we have explained, the existing tidal conditions above this port would be little affected one way or another by the scheme.   99.  Experiments on the model  indicate that the  time taken by sewage deposited in the river at Gloucester to reach the open estuary in the neighbourhood of Steep Holme and Flat Holme is very littlelonger with than without a barrage.               (g) The effect of a barrage on floods.   100.  As regards the effect of  a  barrage upon the  heights in the- basin in times  of flood, the experiments on the model indicate thatfor flood discharges less  than  18,000 cusecs, which corresponds  to about four  times  the  mean  river  flow,  the high-water level   atspring tides is  everywhere less  with than  without a barrage.   Withfloods of greater intensity than this, the high-water level is higherwith than without a barrage, especially in the upper part of the  basinabove Framilode.   101.  In time  of heavy flood or of exceptionally high tides, theheight in  the basin can,  however, readily be limited  by closing the    [7972]                                               a 2
barrage Bluices before high water, and by this means the &quot;effects of heavy floods could be appreciably reduced. .    102.   The fact that a barrage produces  higher low-water levelsmeans that the hydraulic gradient of the river is flattened and thevelocity of  the ebb thereby lessened.  To  meet  this, however, theturbines could be run  at  a greater gate opening, thereby enablingmore water to be discharged.  In this way, the basin low-water levelscould be  maintained at much  the same height as they would  be  ifthe turbines were running under normal river conditions.    103.   Moreover,  the levels  adopted for  the height  to whichthe basin  is to be  lowered are determined by  the gate opening settledfor the turbines.   These are capable, if necessary, of lowering thebasin level  some  2  ft.  more per  tide than is  quoted  and shown onthe drawings.  The low-water levels of -f 4-2 ft. O.D. on mean tidesand 4- 2-2  ft. O.D. on neap tides, which have  been decided upon forthe scheme, were chosen in order to minimise the frictional loss ofhead  that  would  occur as the  result of the resistance of the rockybottom to  the flow of water in its passage over  the English Stones enits  way to the turbines.   Thus, with additional  water available,  itwould still be possible to adhere to these levels by passing  more waterthrough the turbines.   (h) The effect of a barrage on the configuration  of the bed of the                            estuary.    104.   The question of  the  effect which a barrage would have onthe configuration  of the bed of the estuary  was dealt  with in great detail by  Professor  Gibson, one of our members, in the report onthe construction and operation  of the  tidal model which he submitted in May 1929.  Since that date, he has carried out  a further extensiveseries of experiments on modified forms of barrage.   The one finallyadopted has an appreciably greater  sluice-gate  area than that onwhich the original tests were carried out.  The depth of the sluice-gatesills is greater.   The alignment has been altered, and the EnglishStones have been  excavated to  -8-0  ft. O.D.   Consequently, theresults obtained from its operation differ somewhat  in degree  fromthose previously obtained,  although the general conclusions as to theeffect of a  barrage  on the configuration of  the  bed of the estuaryremain unaltered.    105.   Above the barrage,  a  general  flattening of  the banks  is produced  and  there is a  reduction in  the longitudinal  gradient.Below Framilode  there is a  tendency  for  the  sand banks to belowered and for  silt and  sand to be  deposited  in  the  deep-waterchannel and to be carried downstream where  much of it ultimatelyaccumulates in the Shoots.  Above Framilode the bed is only slightlylowered.    106.   Below the  barrage the  average  depth  of the  deep  waterchannel between the Shoots and Avonmouth  is  sensibly the samewith  or   without  the  barrage.   The  depths  in the  King  EoadAnchorage and the  mean  widths &quot;of the channel  giving respectively30  ft. and  18 ft.  at low water of spring tides, are not  appreciablyAffected by the barrage,  while  the  effect on the Newport DeepsChannel is very  small.   The model shows that bars are formed some to 7 miles seaward of Portishead, where the depth  after 40 yearsof operation is reduced by 9  ft.  and 11 ft.  respectively,  becoming6-5 and 6-2 fathoms.   Since this depth of 6-2 fathoms, which is theshallowest point seaward of Portisiiead, is deeper than  some partsof the present channel below Avonmouth, it would appear that  thisshould not affect  navigation up to Avonmouth.    107.   To sum  up, the work of the  model carried out  since May1929  and  outlined  in  the  foregoing paragraphs,  confirms  theconclusions  summarised at the end of our second  interim report andwhich we  are now able to restate as follows:     fa) A  barrage  would not injuriously affect navigation beloiv the          barrage.    ib) Even without dredging, a barrage would not seriously affect          navigation above  the  barrage at any time,  and would          appreciably  improve  it  at  low water,  while with a com-
          paratively small amount of  dredging it would  be at  least          as good at high tides and very considerably better at all          other limes.   (c)  A  barrage  would provide  the  means of reducing  inundation          in the upper estuary in  times of flood in the Severn.     (i)  The effect of a barrage on the Forest of Dean coalfield.   108.   It has been  suggested  that  the construction of a barragemight affect the Forest  of Dean coalfield in the following  ways :    (1)  It might interfere with the facility with which water can be          drained  off the surface of the coalfield.   (2)  Work such as  is  suggested  would  carry  with it  additional          charges  which have to be added  to the existing dock charges          at Lydney and  Sharpness,  where  a considerable part  of          the coal shipped from the coalfield  is loaded.   109.   The Forest of Dean.coalfield, which forms a more or lesscomplete  basin, is situated within  the  water-shed of the  Severn.The strata, especially the lower strata, including the Mill  Stone Gritunderlying the coal measures, contains open fissured sandstones whichhave been proved to hold large quantities of water.  The carboniferouslime stone underlies the Mill Stone Grit and comes  to the surfaceboth on the east and west  of the coalfield.  The outcrop on the eastis  comparatively narrow,  but  that, on the west, is of considerablewidth.   Owing to the  configuration of the coalfield  and the  opennature of the strata, large quantities of  water have  to be  pumpedfor a limited period at  times of heavy rainfall.  It is probable thatduring periods of heavy  rainfall  not  less than 15,000  gallons  ofwater per minute are  pumped.   These  are  distributed  over about five points.  The  normal flow may be taken at  about one half  ofthis quantity.  This water, .when  pumped, is  drained  from the  coal-field chiefly by the Cannop Brook, which  flows more or less throughthe centre of the coalfield and  reaches the Severn at Lydney.  Thisbrook passes off the coal measure strata at 66 ft.  above OrdnanceDatum.   The eastern part of the coalfield  is drained  chiefly by theBlackpool and  Soudley  Brooks, which reach  the  Severn  at a pointeastward  of  the Cannop  Brook.  The Blackpool Brook  passes offthe coal measure at 290 ft.  above Ordnance Datum and the SoudleyBrook at 866 ft. above Ordnance Datum. These two brooks join at the village of Blakely and thereafter are known as Bideford Brook, whichreaches the Severn at a level of 25 ft. above Ordnance Datum.   110.   It will be seen from these levels  that a barrage could not inany way affect the flow  of these brooks reaching the Severn, and thevelocity that they now have  will not be interfered with.  It  may therefore  safely be predicted that  the percolation  through the stratawill be no worse than it is to-day.   111.   There is,  however,  another somewhat  similar point  inregard to  the  underground flow  of water in  connection  with theriver Wye.  It  has been established  that, at  times  of  exceptionalflood, there may be some risk to the collieries upon the western sideof the  coalfield working the Coleford  High Delf  seam, and to anyseam in  which the level of working is substantially below the  levelof the river Wye,  owing to there  being some connection between theWye and  the coalfield.  The reach of the  Wye where this connectionhas been  shown to exist, is that  just below Symond&apos;s Yat.  At thispoint, the. outcrop of the Mill Stone Grit comes very  near the  river and there, is probably some fissure  connection with  the  bed of theriver.   112.   The level of the  river Wye in this neighbourhood appearsto be about 60 ft., and  we understand the flood level is about 70 ft.above Ordnance Datum.  This point is,  however,  a  long way  fromthe tidal water and we see  no reason to suppose that a barrage could in any way affect  the river at so high a level as this.   118.   The  second  point which has  been raised is  that theconstruction of a barrage might entail charges upon the collieries inthis coalfield.  About 25 per cent, of the output of  the  coalfield iashipped at Lydney and  Sharpness, chiefly at the former port.
if)    114.  The coals  from  this field  are  in  close competition  with those  from the eastern valleys of  Monmouthshire, which are  shipped at Newport.  It has been suggested that an increase in cost resulting from  extra charges in locking through  a barrage  might place  the Forest of Dean  collieries at a disadvantage.:  Alternatively, if  the charge were to fall on the  shipowners, it might make the ports of Lydney and  Sharpness less attractive, with  a consequent effect on freights.    115.  These  are  criticisms that are difficult to answer  at this stage.  It  may, however,  later  be found that the proposed  work will make  it  possible for coal to be shipped  from  staithes in  the open  river, thus making it unnecessary for ships  to  enter either Lydney or Sharpness docks.  By this means, it might be possible not only  to avoid an increase  in the cost of delivering the Forest of Dean  coals to their  markets by  sea, but actually  to  do this  more cheaply. (]) The effect of a barrage on   he waterway connecting Birmingham                         and  the Severn.    116.  The construction of a barrage at the English Stones would certainly bring into existence a new harbour above that point.   Such a  harbour might be expected  to have a very material effect on the canal  system  from Sharpness  through Gloucester and Worcester  to Birmingham.   It would  probably also lead  to the revival  of the scheme for widening and deepening the Birmingham-Worcester Canal to make it  suitable for the passage of 100-ton  barges.    117.  Further,  we think it likely that with a large  commercial dock at its base, the business on  the canal would largely increase, as  soon as the  canal was altered to  enable  it to take larger-sized craft.   In  view of the cheap electric power that would be available, we anticipate  also that industrial  firms would build along the  sides of the  canal, where it would be easy to provide wharfage.   (k)  The effect of a barrage on the road connection between south                  Wales and the west of England.    118.  Improved road  transit  to and from south Wales would be  one of the advantages conferred by the Severn barrage scheme, if  the  design  included, as is now  contemplated, the provision of a roadway.   At present,  there is no bridge across the Severn below Gloucester,  and no effective ferry.   All vehicular traffic from London or  Bristol  to  Swansea  and Cardiff has,  therefore,  to  make  use of the Gloucester Bridge.  The usual route from London to Cardiff  is via Oxford, Gloucester, Lydney. Chepstow, and Newport, the  total distance being about  165 miles.    A variant of this  route  is via Gloucester,  Boss, Monmouth and Newport, the total distance  in this case being about  170 miles.  From Bristol to Cardiff via Gloucester Bridge the  distance is  roughly 88  miles.  Assuming that a fairly direct  connection could be made from the barrage to existing  main roads on each side of the Severn,  it would be possible to reduce the distance from London  to  Cardiff  and other destinations in  south Wales  by  15 or  20 miles, and  the Bristol-Cardiff distance by about 50 miles.    119.   As the Severn  barrage  scheme makes no provision for any works beyond high-water mark, it is  necessary to consider  what would  have to be done in  order  to connect  the barrage road  with the existing highway system.   We have not worked out this problem in detail,  and confine ourselves, therefore, to the following observa- tions:   Road traffic from London to  south  Wales  via  the  barrage would  follow the London-Bath  road, A.4, to Chippenham, which lies at a distance of about 25  miles as the crow flies from the barrage.For 2  miles west of Chippenham,  use might be made  of  A.480 (theMarshfield-Bristol road),  but from that  point  to the barrage,  say28  miles,  there  are  no   direct  connections,  and  considerable expenditure would have to  be  incurred  in remodelling the existinglength   of  highways  to be  embodied in the  new route  and  inconstructing connecting links.  The cost would  not be likely  to fall short of  500,000, especially if allowance is made for effecting minor improvements in the access from Bristol.   On  the  Welsh  side ofthe Severn barrage little more would be necessary than the construe-
tion  of  a  suitable  connection  through  Port  Skewett  with  theChepstow-Newport  road, A.487, which runs roughly parallel to theriver at a distance therefrom  of I or 2  miles.  The connection shouldbe  forked so as  to provide one branch for traffic proceeding fromthe  barrage in a north-easterly direction, and another for  vehiclesproceeding south-westwards.   The  cost  of  these road  works wouldprobably be covered by a provision of,  say,  100,000.   If the figures are  rounded off so as to reach  a  total having a reasonable marginfor  contingencies, the cost of the road connections on  both sides of the Severn may be put at approximately   050,000.  The  scheme.as  prepared by the consulting engineers, has been drawn up  afterconsultation with the roads Department of the Ministry  of Transport,and has been designed to meet their technical requirements as regardslay-out, strength and traffic.  Naturally, however,  at this stage theMinistry  have  not been  officially  consulted,  and are in  no  wisecommitted to any support  of the scheme.(1) The effect of a  barrage on the railway connection between south                  Wales and the west of England.    120.   Since  1845 no less than eighteen applications have beenmade to Parliament by the Great Western Railway Company^ involving the  crossing, either by  tunnelling or bridging, of the river  Severn.All but four of  these,  i.e., the Severn Junction Railway in 1845, theSouth Wales and Great  Western Direct Railway in  1865. the  severn bridge (Severn and Wye Railway)  in  1872,  and  the  Severn TunnelBailway  in  1872, were either abandoned or rejected.   The workscontemplated in these four applications were only carried out in thetwo  latter cases.    121.   Of the  eighteen schemes, eleven  contemplated  a  bridgingof the estuary  in the neighbourhood  of the present Severn Bridgenear Sharpness, or at points  a little higher  up.   Additional schemes were prepared  in the years 1865,  1872, and 1896, for  bridging the severn estuary in the neighbourhood  of  Beachley.   The   severn bridge scheme  was  authorised  in 1872, and was  completed  andopened for traffic in 1879.    122.   Powers for  tunnelling under the  Severn  were applied forby  the Great   Western Railway in 1868,  1865, 1870,  and 1872.Finally the present Severn  Tunnel was constructed under the powersgranted by the Act of 1872,  and it was opened  for traffic in 1876.    128.   Since  1886  no  further  application has  been  made  toParliament for powers  to  cross  the  estuary,  but  in  1919-20, weunderstand that  the  company had under consideration  alternative schemes for improving their  existing railway facilities in the bristol and south Wales area, which involved, inter alia, a bridge over the severn at Beachley (Oldbury  Sands) and provision for improvements in  the gradients  of their   railway  northward  of  Bristol.   no definite action  was, however, taken by the company in respect ofthese schemes.    124.  In the barrage scheme dealt with  in this  report, proposals are included for building a bridge  to carry the railway  traffic acrossthe  site of the  barrage.   No difficulty  is anticipated  in providingsuitable railway gradients  so as to  connect up with  the   existingGreat Western  Railway lines on either  side of the  Severn.    125.  This  scheme does not, however, afford equal  facilities forthe improvement  of the gradients to the northward  of Bristol, whichwas  contemplated under the Great Western Bailway Beachley Bridge(Oldbury Sands) scheme of 1919-20.   The  carrying  of the  railwayover the Severn by means of a viaduct, opening bridges,  and  the barrage solid embankment,  would, however,  give an alternative route to  the Severn  Tunnel,   which  would  enable  the  company  to discontinue the use of the  steep gradients on  either  side  of  thepresent tunnel.    126.  The  scheme would  shorten  the distance between bristol and  the  south Wales ports  when   compared  with  the   railwaycompahy&apos;s Oldbury  Sands scheme  prepared in  1919-20,  but  asregards the  South Wales-Swindon-London  route, no shortening  ofthis distance would bo provided  by the barrage railway connection.The scheme  would,  however, enable  the  Great  Western  BailwayCompany, if they so desired it, to dispense with the Severn Tunnel,
 which is somewhat expensive in upkeep.  The  scheme, as prepared by the consulting engineers, has been  drawn up  after consultation with  the railway company;s  officials, and has been designed to meet their  technical requirements  as regards lay-out,  strength,, and traffic. Naturally, however, at this stage the company have not been officially consulted,  and are therefore not committed to the scheme in any way.    (m) The effect of a barrage on the Severn and Wye fisheries.    127.   We have considered  also the effect which a barrage at the English Stones might have  on the Severn  and Wye fisheries.  The fishing in  the Severn, which  is of small value only, is not likely to be  adversely affected.   The Wye salmon fisheries are, however, of considerable value.   The  chief  fear  that might be  entertained in regard to  these is  that, if a barrage was constructed,  it would be  less easy for the fish to run up the  river.  For many hours on every tide, however, sluices having a width of 5,200 ft. would be fully open to pass the sea-water to the up-stream basin.    128.   As regards the return of the fish  to the  sea,  any large fish could  stem the inflow of the tides over the English  Stones and go  out by the same  way  as they  came in, i.e., through  the open sluices.  There would be  no danger of the large  fish entering  the turbines,  as they  would be  prevented  from doing so by the debris screens which it is proposed to erect.   Any kelts and immature fish that  could  not stem the  flow  through the sluices  could  pass  the screens and would come to no harm by passing through the turbines, for the openings are 20 ft.  in diameter at their smallest  part and the revolutions of the turbines  are  so slow  that  these  fish would not suffer  more discomfort  than they do,  say,  in  passing through the rocky falls of the Scottish rivers.    129.  Fears may  also  be entertained regarding  the  effect  that any siltation in the Wye might  have on the industry.   It will be seen (paragraph 93) that it is proposed to remove any siltage  that  may take place  above the  barrage by means of  dredgers.  When this is known we consider that any fears on these grounds would be allayed.    130.  One of the  questions, however, which may arise owing to the proposed storage  reservoir  being situated some 8^ miles up  the river  Wye, is the effect which the rush of water  towards  the inlet pipes  supplying the  pumps  near the  Trelleek  Grange site, which fill the high level reservoir, may  have on the fish.  We consider that the danger of fish being drawn into these  suction  pipes  could be overcome by means of screens similar to those proposed to be erected in front of the turbines at the English Stones.  It is difficult, however, to say whether the  taking-in  of water  from  the Wye between  the periods of 1-5 hours after high water up to 2 hours  after low water and redischarging it  thereto between  the periods of about 2 hours. after  low  water up to 1-5  hours after high water  may  have  any effect on the running of the fish.  In our opinion  this should do no harm,  for the  depth  of the river Wye will  be  improved, as  the water discharged from the turbines should tend to deepen  the river from  the Trelleck  Grange site  down to its mouth.   It is, therefore, possible that the approach for the fish up to the fresh  water  part of the Wye, t.e., the part where tidal action has  ceased, may actuallybe improved, for there would always be a greater depth at low water.    131.  It  may also be necessary for the  satisfactory  working of the barrage  scheme  to  remove  the  weir obstructions  that  exist across this  river below the site of the intakes for the pumping station for the reservoir.  We understand that these weirs are only placed across the river so  as to maintain for angling a greater depth of water on the lowest of the tides.   Their removal  should, therefore, do no harm. The  placing of this reservoir substation  up the river might.therefore,  have an effect  that  was  ultimately beneficial rather thanharmful to the salmon fisheries, for the scheme  in no way interferes with the fresh water portion of the river.  YI__ESTIMATE  OF  THE  ELECTRICAL  ENERGY  THAT      WOULD BE  AVAILABLE  FROM  A  BARRAGE.   132.  The energy  that would be available  from a barrage  hasbeen  carefully  estimated  by Professor Gibson,  who has calculatedit   at  half-hourly intervals  from  the  tide  curves.    Indepen-
dent  calculations  have also been  made by Mr. Shirley Hawkins.These have been calculated at intervals of  15  minutes,  representingapproximately a fall of from 8 to 8 inches per quarter hour accordingto the working head of the turbines.  These calculations give almost exactly the same result regarding the power that would be available.    188.   Simultaneous tide curves from the upper estuary with theproposed  barrage  at the English  Stones show that the rate of fall of the surface level  over the  greater  part of  the working periodof the turbines is approximately the  same at all points  between the barrage and Sharpness.   Above  Sharpness,  however,  the rate offall is very different, especially during the first  part of the workingperiod,  and above Framilode  the  level actually continues to  rise.The rates, both of rise and fall, of the levels in the tidal basin differwidely from those obtaining when  the barrage is not in position.    184.   In estimating the areas of the water surfaces at different levels, to be used in determining  the  potential  power output,  it isnecessary to take into account the actual  rate of fall at each partof the basin. These vary somewhat with the programme of operationsadopted and with  the  length of the  working period,  but taking thecycle  of operations calculated  by Professor Gibson for spring, meanand neap  tides, the volumes of water leaving the  tidal basin for each1 foot fall in level at Beachley  have been computed from the  data ofthe latest Admiralty charts.  These are given  in the following  table(table 8).                            TABLE 3.Volumes of  water leaving  the Severn tidal basin for each  1  ft. fall                      in  level  at  Beachley.Level at Boaelilev ft. O.D.).	T, , c , . .

The last column in the foregoing table gives the  &quot; equiva-lent&quot;  area of a tidal basin which, assuming the level  everywhereto fall at  the same  rate as at Beachley,  would give  the  correctdischarge through  the barrage.   In  computing these  curves  andvolumes,  an allowance of 5  per cent,  has been  made for the effectof siltation in reducing  the&quot; basin  area.  The experiments on the model  indicate that at the end of forty years of operation the volumeof the basin  above  Ordnance  Datum  would only  be reduced  by1-5 per  cent., and that  after this period the rate  of reduction ofvolume would not exceed  1 per cent, in each  sixty years of operation.    136.   In deducing the available output  from the barrage,  wehave assumed  that the  minimum  working  heads  at the beginningand end of the working period are 5-0  ft. Preliminary investigationshave indicated that the most economical  scheme,  if utilising the typeof turbine selected (paragraph  151 below),  would reqn.&quot;    npibxi-mately 67 such units,  each having a runner 20 ft. in diameu..    [7972]                                                n
   187.  In computing the potential output of the scheme, we havetaken into  account losses due to flow over the English Stones, andhave assumed (a) that the maximum output per turbine at springtides is not to exceed approximately 17,000 b.h.p.; and (b) that theEnglish Stones are to be excavated to -8-0 ft.  O.D., and that the.W.  level in the basin at  Beachley is  -t-23-0 ft.  O.D. at springtides, 4-18-0 ft. O.D. at mean tides, and -t-12-5 ft. O.D. at neap tide3.In doing this, various programmes of operation have been investigated,all of which, however, have the same initial and  final working head,and those outlined in the following tables show the output availablewhen using 67 turbines.188.  The essential results of this investigation are as follows : --	level 01H.W. in basin.	Level ofL.W.	Working head.		Max. dis-charge.	Working period.	Max. output.	Output.			Max.	Min.				Springs ...

Taking  706 tides  per annum, the  total potential output from the generators amounts to 2,252 million units per annum.  If themaximum output at spring tides is reduced to  700,000  kilowatts, thetotal output becomes 2,182 million units per annum.    140.   In these calculations we have used the turbine  efficienciesas deduced  from tests by the manufacturers.  The mean  efficienciesof the  generators  have been  taken as 0-94  over spring tides, as0-98 over  mean  tides,  and  as 0-90 over neap  tides.   A  similarinvestigation shows that the output would  be  increased by  approxi-mately  2-0 per cent., if there were 72 turbines.    141.   It will be observed that the level in  the basin at springtides is not lowered below 4-9 -1 ft. O.D.  This is  due to the limitationof the maximum output per turbine to 17,000 brake horse-power.  this rate of output is maintained for approximately 4-5  hours, during whichperiod  the   turbines  are  working  much  below  their  maximumcapacity.    142.   Any  attempt to reduce the L.W. level on mean and  neaptides below  4-4-2  ft. and  4-2-2 ft.  respectively, would  lead to a reduced output owing to the increase  in the losses of head over theEnglish  Stones.    148.   A somewhat greater  output  could be obtained by delaying the  time of opening the turbine gates,  so  as  to get a larger meanworking head, but this has the  disadvantage that  it curtails the work-ing  period.   Thus,  by holding up the water until the head at thebeginning of the working period is 12-5 ft. at  mean and neap tides,the  potential output is increased by approximate^ 6 per  cent, overthe  whole lunar cycle.  This, however, entails  a reduction of theworking period by 0-8 hr. at mean tides and 1-4 hrs. at neap tides.    144.   In the following tables (tables  4 to 7) we give the potentialpower output obtainable from a barrage at the English Stones with67 turbines of the type selected.  Table 4 gives this for spring tides, onthe assumption that the maximum  output of each turbine is approxi-mately 15,000 brake horse-power.   In  tables 5, 6 and 7, we give thopotential  output of  the same  number of  turbines  for spring  tides(table  5), mean tides (table  6),  and  neap  tides  (table 7),  on theassumption  that each turbine will  attain its maximum  output  for theavailable head.

   YII. CIVIL  ENGINEERING  WORKS  RECOMMENDED.                  (a) Preliminary investigations.    1-15.  On being informed that the second stage of the investigationfor the construction of the Severn barrage was to proceed, we were authorised   to  approach   Messrs.   Coode,  Wilson,   Mitchell,  andVaughan-Lee  in  August  1929 to ascertain whether  they  would be willing to  act  as consulting  engineers  and to prepare a completescheme comprising  the necessary  drawings  in sufficient  detail toenable accurate quantities to be calculated, but not in such completedetail  as would be necessary for  contract purposes.   The  work wasto include the necessary drawing for the        (1) sluice dam and  sluices,       (2) turbine dam, turbines and electrical machinery,       (8) locks and bridges,       (4) railway and road viaducts,       (5) embankment and closing of the shoots,including quantities and estimates, but excluding contract conditions,specification or schedule of prices.    146.  On the  16th August, 1929, the  above firm  consented toact as  consulting engineers on the foregoing terms.    147.  At an early  stage of our consultations with the consulting engineers it became apparent  that in regard to certain parts of thescheme, eg.,  basin sluices, turbines, &amp;c,  it would  be necessary tosecure the co-operation of leading firms of specialist designers and manufacturers.   In  the following paragraphs we describe  the steps which we took in connection with these matters.                         (i) Basin sluices.    148.  Specialist manufacturing  firms  were asked  whether thej&apos;would  be  prepared to collaborate with  the consulting  engineers in preparing  fully-dimensioned   working  drawings  of  the  sluices,occupying a lineal length of 6,825 ft. with an effective width of water-way of 5,200 ft., i.e., 180 bays at 52 ft. 6 ins. centres with 40 ft. clearopening, the sill level  of the sluices to be  -10 ft.  O.D.  They were asked to recommend a type of sluice and to submit working  drawings,together with  all details of the hoisting and lowering machinery andof the size of electric motor that would be required for  the opening andclosing, together with drawings showing what preparation would haveto be made in the masonry of the piers for the fixing of the sluices andon the coping for the  lifting gear and machinery.  The sluices were also to be designed so that they could be simultaneously opened orshut by means of switches in the remote control room.                           (ii) Turbines.    149.  As a tidal  power scheme  involves the  use of  a  turbinewhich  will  work at a reasonably high efficiency at a  constant speedunder  widely  varying  heads,  we had to decide  which  firms shouldbe approached with a view to designing and supplying the  necessary information regarding  the performance of such  a  turbine.  after careful  consideration,  we decided to approach  two  firms,  makingthree different turbines capable of being  worked under the conditionsstated in paragraph 18  above.  Both firms have had a wide experience in the design and construction of turbines  of the largest dimensionsfor use in low-head plants, and possess research  laboratories in whichthe special  requirements of the turbines for a tidal scheme could be investigated.    150.  These firms  were accordingly asked whether they would boprepared to  work in conjunction with the consulting engineers for thepurpose of submitting fully-dimensioned working drawings for  a seriesof 20-ft. diameter variable-head turbines working at a constant speed of 62-5 revolutions per minute under varying heads, together withdetailed drawings  of  a  turbine  unit,  its  foundation  details  and complete drawings for the draft tube and the bead race.  We selected62-5 revolutions per minute in order to  suit tho standard frequency of the electrical  plant  now being adopted  throughout the country,
viz., 50 cycles per second.  The firms were also asked to submit datagiving a guaranteed water discharge with a guaranteed  output  and efficiency for their turbine running at a constant  speed under headsvarying from 5 to 85 ft.    151.  On receipt  of the  above data  from  the  turbine nianu-facturers, a  comparison of  the respective  merits  of the  schemes submitted and  of the  electrical output  that could be generated by each of the three types  enabled us to select the  most suitable typeof turbine for use in the tidal power scheme.                    (iii) Electrical  machinery.    152.  Specialist manufacturing firms were  asked whether  theywould be prepared to collaborate with the consulting engineers  andthe turbine manufacturers and to  submit fully-dimensioned outlinedrawings of  three-phase 50-cycle  generators,  each  generator to be capable of a normal output of 10,000 kws., and an overload capacityof 12,000 kws., the turbine shaft at the beginning of the tidal cycleonly exerting about 1,250 brake horse-power, rising  to 15,000 brakehorse-power with a maximum at times of 17,000 brake horse-power,the water  turbine shaft running at 62-5  revolutions per minute.Drawings of  one  generator unit complete with its foundation details were to be  supplied, and complete outlined drawings  for the switchesand other  auxiliaries  necessary to  connect  the generators with theCentral Electricity Board&apos;s  transmission system (the grid).    the firms  were  to  recommend  what  should be  the pressure  at  thegenerator  terminals.  They  were  also  asked  to include  for  eachgenerator unit a  step-up transformer having a secondary voltage of182 k.v.; and to prepare a plan showing the lay-out  of the electricalauxiliaries  of the scheme  embodying one complete  generator unit,together with an  estimate of  the cost of one generator unit complete,including its proportion of switches, cables and auxiliary  equipment.The schemes were submitted by the  manufacturers in due course,and after careful examination  we were able  to  select the schemewhich afforded the greatest advantage.                          (iv)  Caissons.    158.  Specialist manufacturing  firms were asked whether theywould be prepared, in conjunction  with  the consulting engineers, tosubmit  preliminary sketch designs  with an approximate  estimate of cost.for the whole of the caissons and  their hauling machinery,  forthe three locks  to pass  shipping through the  barrage, the work toinclude the preparation  of full designs  and estimates for the eightsliding caissons and their hauling machinery.                       (v) Operating cranes.    154.  Owing  to the  great  weights of the  separate parts of theturbines and the electrical  generators, we found  it necessary toprovide in the scheme for two large cranes to lift the respective partsof  the  machinery,  and  we decided to ask specialist manufacturingfirms whether, in consultation with the consulting  engineers, theywould design a  crane of this type.   We thought  it desirable  thatsluice gates should be provided to  close, when necessary,  the waterpassages of any one turbine  in each group of nine so that the watercould be  drained off  for  purposes of repair  and  overhaul of themachinery, and the head and tail races.  .The  specialists were askedwhether they would undertake the design of these sluice gates.                 (vi) Additional model  experiments.    155. On receipt  of the  various particulars  of  the  guaranteeddischarges  of water  from the turbine, we  found  it necessary toconstruct an additional model on a  larger scale, to  embody the  areaof  the English Stones (i.e.,  the site upon which it is suggested  the barrage should be founded)  in order to  ascertain the level  to whichthey should be  excavated to allow the water supplying the turbines toflow over them  without  undue  loss of head.   Professor Gibson, oneof  our members, kindly  undertook  to supervise the  construction and running of this model.  In the light of the report which he submitted.
we earne to the conclusion that it was necessary for the level of theEnglish Stones to be lowered to -8 ft. O.D., if the best overall results were to be obtained.  (b) Description of the works proposed by the consulting engineers.   156.  We  propose  now  to  describe the civil  engineering  worksdesigned by  Messrs.  Coode,  Wilson, Mitchell,  and  Vaughan-Lee,M.M.Inst.C.E., the consulting engineers.  In  designing  these works,it was necessary to provide that the barrage should    (a) enable the maximum  output  of  electricity to  be  generated          consistent with the  economic construction of the requisite          sluice  and turbine dams, &amp;c.   (b) satisfy navigation requirements, i.c, that it would include the          necessary locks, guide piers, &amp;c.   (c) provide for rail  and road cross-river traffic,  i.e., that it  would          include viaducts, rolling lift bridges, &amp;c.   157.   It will be appreciated that the physical conditions of theBite,  in view of their special character, have been the predominant in some  directions the sole factor determining the  lay-out of theworks.   The general plans of the proposed  works  show that thenatural advantages of  the  English Stones have been  fully exploitedfor the construction thereon of  the  sluice  dam,  turbine  dam,  and navigation locks,  and  that the existing  deep-water  channel  (theShoots) will be occupied by the embankment dam.   It is proposedthat  the sluice dam should be constructed across the southern portionof the English  Stones,  and should extend from  the eastern shoreto the eastern margin of the  Shoots where  it joins the southernextremity of  the turbine  dam.  The  proposed turbine  dam is4,550  ft.  in  overall length, and is  also to  be constructed on theEnglish  Stones  along  the  eastern  margin of the  Shoots,  making  ajunction  down-stream  with the western  end  of the sluice dam andat the up-stream end joining  the southern return  wall of  the locks.This dam will accommodate 72 turbines and electric generator units.   158.   Three  navigation locks at the up-stream end of the turbinedam are proposed in order that  vessels  may  be passed through the barrage.   One of the larger-width locks will be necessary to deal withthe existing traffic.  The other two would only be required as the tradeabove  the  barrage developed.   These locks,  which have  also been located on the English Stones, have been designed as follows:    (a) Lock No. 1 would be in one length of 750 ft. between the end          caissons, the width between copings being 80  ft., the level          of  the caisson sills being at 80 ft. below Ordnance Datum          and the coping level at 85  ft.  above Ordnance Datum. A          lock of these dimensions, after allowing  sufficient clearance          for manoeuvring  purposes,  should  permit  the passage ol          vessels up to  approximately 25,000 gross tonnage.   (b) Lock  No.  2  would  be  identical  with Lock No. 1 in every          respect  except that  provision is made by an  intermediate          caisson  for dividing the lock  into  two  separate compart-          ments 400 ft. and  825 ft. in  length respectively.   (c) Lock  No.  8 would also  be 750 ft. in length between the end          caissons, but the width between  the copings will be only          50 ft.,  and the  level of  the  caisson  sills  25  ft.  below          Ordnance  Datum.  An intermediate caisson would  divide          the lock into two separate compartments 475 ft.  and 250 ft.          in  length respectively.   159.   The embankment dam, including the closing of the Shoots,will  extend for a length  of approximately 4,000 ft. from the westernside  of the locks to the western shore,  thus  completing from shoreto shore the barrage necessary for the retention in the impoundingbasin of the  water required for operating the turbines.   160.   It  is proposed that  rail and road  communication betweenthe eastern and western shores should be provided by the construc-tion  of a viaduct over the English Stones.  This would be connectedwith  the locks,  which  would be crossed by lifting bridges.  Thencethe road and the  railway would run along the embankment dam tothe western  side.   To avoid interruption of traffic, the railway and     [7972]                                                 i
road would cross both the up-stream and down-stream ends of thelocks, the traffic being diverted either to the up-stream or down-streambridges as may  be  required  when  vessels are passing through thelocks.                    (i) Sluice dam and  sluices.    161.   As the function of the sluice  dam is to permit  the  floodtide to pass through  to the  up-stream  side  of  the  barrage,  and toretain it there,  it is manifestly desirable that its design should be such as would enable the impounding basin to be filled to the capacityof any normal  tide.    162.   Drawing  no.  3  submitted by the  consulting  engineers(appendix, drawing  no.  3) gives  a general  plan of  the sluice  dam,and shows that a total length of 6,825  ft. is available.  To providethe  requisite  stability against  the hydrostatic pressure when thesluice gates  are  closed,  comparatively   narrow but  long  piers arenecessary.  The  piers which have been designed  12 ft.  6  in. inwidth, and 91 ft. in length,  are spaced 52 ft. 6 in. centre to centre,thus allowing a  clear width  for the openings of 40  ft.  With thesedimensions it is  practicable to obtain 130 sluice openings giving an effective width of waterway of  5,200 ft.    163.   Having regard to the  existing surface levels of the EnglishStones on the line of the  sluice dam, and in order  to reduce as faras possible the velocity of  the flood tide  through the sluice  openingswithout incurring an excessive  quantity  of rock excavation, the silllevel of the sluices has been  placed at -10 ft. O.D.    164.   As a result of  calculations  and model experiments,  it isproposed that the English Stones should be excavated to a general level of  -8  ft.  O.D.  in order  to reduce, to  reasonable limits, the losses due to the friction of the water passing over  them.   A seriesof experiments  conducted by Professor Gibson shows clearly the gain in output to be derived  from lowering  the sill  level, especially at neap tides.   The experiments also show that even  if all the  sluicesremained open the water  level  in the impounding basin  would not fall  below -4-5 ft.  O.D.  at  neap  tides,  or below  a somewhat higher level at spring tides.  As  it is almost inconceivable  that thewhole of the 130  sluice gates should fail to close throughout the wholeof the falling tide,  it has been decided  to  adhere  to the  sill  levelof -10 ft. O.D.   165.  According  to the proposed design,  the piers  of the sluicedam will be brought up  to  a  level of  4-32 ft.  O.D., i.e.,  3  ft.above the highest recorded tide.  Surmounting the main piers therewill be auxiliary  piers 34 ft.  in height by 9  ft.  in width to supportthe apparatus for the  normal operations  of raising and lowering thesluice gates.   166.  Advantage  has  been  taken of the extra  length of  pierbeyond that requisite to house  the sluice gates, to  construct along the  whole length of  the dam  immediately  down-stream  of the auxiliary piers  a  service road with railway track spanning  the  pierson  their down-stream ends:  This service road would provide rail and  road connection with the shore and  also with the turbine dam.Upon the main girders carrying the road, two overhead cranes willrun  for the purpose of lifting out the^ main sluice gates when theserequire such major repairs as cannot Conveniently be  undertaken atthe site of the dam, and also for the purpose of placing the temporary-stop gates  when  it is necessary to insert these in  connection  withminor repairs to  the main gates.    167.  Although normallv  the  gates would be raised and loweredwhen there is little or no difference between the water level on  each side, the gear would be designed to permit the gates in an emergencyto be  operated   under - the severest  conditions  in  regard   to waterpressure which could  conceivably arise.    168.  The operating gear would consist  of  an  electrically-drivencentral crab connected by cross-shafting  to two end crabs containing the  winding  barrels.  Emergency hand  lifting gear would also beprovided, and suitable brakes for  sustaining the gates in any desiredposition.  It is proposed that the sluice  gates should be operated inIS groups,of ten units each.
    169.  The  wliole  of  the  18  groups could  be operated  within ten minutes, the gates being so spaced that the opening and closing efforts  would be approximately equal.  The time occupied in closing is of  course  the  more  important consideration.  The  18 groups of. sluices would  be independently  set  in motion from the  main-control station.  It would,  however, be arranged that each group could,  if necessary,  be controlled on the  spot  and  also that any individual gate could be cut out from its group.    170.  For  closing a sluice  opening  for the  purpose of  effecting repairs to the main gates, temporary stop gates  in sections would be provided  for placing in the grooves formed in the piers on either side of the main gate grooves.                   (ii) Turbine dam and turbines.   171.  A general plan, submitted to us by the consulting engineers, of the turbine dam  is given in the appendix  (drawing no. 8), and from this  it will be  observed that the total length of  the dam is  approxi- mately 4,550 ft.,  housing  72 turbines  and  generator  units placed. These are 61 ft. 6 ins. centre to centre.    172.  The  turbine dam would be constructed on  the  English Stones along the eastern margin of the Shoots, thus taking advantage of this deep-water channel  for the  turbine discharge.    178.  It is essential that the turbine dam should  be designed as a  gravity  dam, i.e., that it  should  be  capable  of resisting entirely by its own weight the  maximum hydrostatic pressures  which  could be brought upon it.  In this connection, it is desirable to draw attention to the large spaces occupied by  the turbines and  their  accessories and by the intake and  outlet  chambers.    174.  In  order to keep the  maximum  intensity  of  pressure within reasonable limits, it  has been necessary to give considerable thickness to  the masonry between the turbine units.  Provision has been made on  both  sides of the  turbine  dam  for the insertion of temporary stop gates to  enable the water  to be  shut  off from the inlet and  outlet passages to the turbine when inspection or repairs are required.  Arrangements are provided  for dewatering the inlet and  outlet passages at the  turbines,  also for  accommodating the cooling water  pumps  and pipes required  in  connection  with the generators.  Requisite cable and pipe tunnels, together with a main communication tunnel for access to the turbines and turbine governor chambers, will also be provided.  GRID3  would be attached  to the turbine intakes on  the up-stream face of the turbine dam to prevent debris from entering the  water passages.    175.  For general transport purposes a standard-gauge main-line railway track would  be laid  along the whole length  of the  turbine dam on the up-stream side of the generators and would  be connected to the  corresponding railway track along the  sluice dam by  a turn- table placed  at the junction  of the two dams.   176.  Two operating cranes would be installed on the turbine dam for handling the turbine and generator machinery. These machines would  operate  on  a  track  of  60 ft.  gauge,  spanning the  turbo- generators and the railway  track.   The lifting capacity of each crane would be 200 tons so as to enable the combined weight of the turbine runner (112 tons) and generator  rotor  (80 tons) to be  dealt with as a whole.  A travelling workshop would  be attached to  each crane to permit minor repairs to the generating machinery to be undertaken on the spot.                            (hi) Locks.    177.  The  general plan of the  proposed works showing the locks is given in the appendix (drawing no. 8).  The actual periods during which  vessels  can  enter  or leave  the  locks are determined by the times  when there is sufficient depth of water to enable the caissons to  be  operated.   The corresponding minimum water  levels are -&apos;r 8 ft. O.D.  in the case of Locks Nos.  1 and 2, which have a sill level of  -30  ft.   O.D.,  and  4-4-5  ft.  O.D. in  the case  of Lock No.  8 which has a sill level of -25 ft. O.D.   On spring tide8 the period  would accordingly extend  from about  three hours before to three  hours  after  high  water.  On neap  tides  the corresponding     [7972]                                               1 2
                                (ill period  would be from about 2-25  hours before to 2-5 hours after high water.    178.  In the last I hour and  1-5 hours of these periods, when locking is practicable, the turbines  would be in operation.   During their discharge an  appreciable current might  be  created  across the channel leading to the down-stream  end of the locks causing possible inconvenience  to vessels.  This  current would  not, however,  be excessive  in  this early stage of the  turbine discharge  and would not extend to any great distance below  the down-stream end of the turbine dam.  Vessels in the immediate vicinity  of the locks would be protected from  its influence by the  guide  pier.   In  any  case, periods of  approximately  4-5 hours  and  4  hours would  still  be available  at  spring  and  neap tides  respectively on each  side, even if the  passage  of  vessels  were  restricted to  the period  when the turbines were idle.    179.  The  water level in the impounding basin up-stream of the barrage may be higher or lower than the tidal level  down-stream, according to the state of the  tide.   For this reason  the  consulting engineers propose   that  there should  be  installed  caissons  of  the sliding type  which  can readily be designed to withstand the hydro- static pressure from either side.   If ordinary  lock gates were to be adopted, they would require to be duplicated in every case to  provide for  this alternating pressure.  Moreover,  their use  would entail considerable increase in the length of the locks, with a corresponding increase in their cost.    180.   For the passage  of  a vessel into or  out of  the lock,  the caisson would be withdrawn from  its groove by electrically-operated hauling gear into a  recess or chamber  formed for  the purpose in the side wall of the lock and subsequently replaced in its groove by the same gear.   The  caissons would be provided  with air and  ballast chambers  so that their buoyancy could be regulated whilst  preserving proper  stability.    181.   The caisson deck would form a roadway  and would  be pro- vided with a railway track of standard  gauge.  The deck would be of the hinged falling type which, when the caisson was hauled from its position in the lock,  would automatically drop so as to pass under the roof of the caisson chamber.  The caissons have been designed so that they may be floated away for  repairs or  other purposes, water beingadmitted to the ballast chamber to give the requisite stability.    182.  The general level of the coping and the surface of the made ground on either side of the locks  has been fixed at +S5 ft. O.D. The main  portion of  the  work would  be of  mass concrete,  but the consulting engineers propose to  face the walls  with blue  or  brindle bricks  and to make  the sill stones and quoins at the caisson  recesses and grooves, the general facing of the caisson recesses, and  the coping of the locks, throughout of granite or other selected stone.    183.  The consulting engineers propose that the filling  culverts ^ould be carried along within  the main walls having outlets into the locks at suitable intervals.  Capstans, bollards, fairleads and  ladderswould be provided, as required, with  a flight of boat steps at each endof each of the locks  and with subways for the accommodation  of post-office, railway and other cables.    184.   A guide pier, 750 ft. in length, would be constructed both up-stream and  down-stream between the approaches to  Locks Nos. 1 and 2, to assist vessels entering or leaving these locks.  They wouldhe  openwork  steel   structures equipped with  rendering, bollards,steps, etc.  A row of steel sheet piling could be provided, if considered necessary,  to  give   protection  from  the  cross-currents  which  would occur during that period when the locks were brought into  use before the turbine and  embankment dams had been  completed.   On  the western side of the narrowest lock, Lock No. 3,  and at each end of it, the scheme provides for shorter guide piers in the  form of connected dolphins.  Provision has  also been made for  isolated dolphins at the north  and south entrances to the  locks, where protection has  not already been afforded by  the works above referred  to.    185.  In order to provide protection to the up-stream entrances ofthe looks, the consulting  engineers propose that an embankment and
reclamation area should be constructed on the east side of the locks ina northerly direction.  This area should prove extremely useful as a site  for workshops and  buildings generally  in connection  with the completed scheme and, moreover, during the construction of the workswould furnish a convenient site for the disposal of excavations.                     (iv) Embankment  dam.   186.  The  method  of  constructing  the   embankment  dam,including the blocking of the deep water channel known as the Shootslying between the western margin of the English Stones and the rockyreefs &quot; Gruggy &quot; and  &quot; Lady Bench,&quot; required very careful considera-tion  in view of the  exceptionally  difficult conditions which  obtain.The  consulting engineers are  confident,  however, that the  problemcan be satisfactorily solved.   187.  The general width of the deep channel at the site of theproposed embankment is  about 1,200 ft., with a maximum depth of-80  ft. O.D. or  about 60  ft. below  the  level of low water atspring tides.  Tidal streams in the channel are exceptionally strong,a surface velocity of  8&apos;75 knots  having  been measured on the floodat spring tides in the course of the recent survey undertaken by theHydrographer of  the  Navy.  Even  at neap tides, very high velocitiesare  encountered.   Moreover,  the duration  of  slack  water  is sonegligible that the  periods throughout a lunation when the  strengthof the current is  moderate,  are very restricted.   188.  Owing  to the velocity  of the tidal stream it has not beenfound  possible to examine  the bed of the Shoots by diver, but thesoundings indicate  a  hard bottom,  probably  bare rock without over-lying sand  or soft material.  In the circumstances, it is necessary toconsider the possibility  that  the material  for  the  embankmentdeposited  through  the  water  may  be carried away by the currentbefore it comes to  rest.   Anything in the nature of solid blockworkwould  be  out of  the  question  owing to the impossibility of settingblocks in such a tideway.  It would be equally impracticable to close the channel by tipping a rubble bank from one or  both ends  of thedam, since, as the opening narrowed, the velocities of the tidal streamwould  be increased so greatly as to render futile any further depositof stone.  In the consulting engineers&apos; opinion, the  most satisfactory solution would be to  bring up  the  work in more  or  less even layersextending across the waterway, thus gradually forcing more and more of the ebb and flood stream through the sluice dam openings.   To thisend, they propose that the embankment dam should be constructed bydepositing two banks  across the channel.  Of these,  one would be forthe up-stream face of the embankment  (which  would be undertakenfirst), and the other for the down-stream face.   The space between the banks would be filled  with suitable  material so as to form an  approxi-mately  watertight  core.   Some  difficulty might  be experienced indepositing the lowest  layers resting on the clean bed of the  channel,but once these had been satisfactorily stabilised, the  rest of the work should present no special  difficulty.   189.   After a base  of rubble had been formed across the  water-way the bank would be  gradually built up  as  high as possible bydepositing  stone  from  hopper barges.  When this  method becameno longer practicable, the bank would be completed by tipping fromthe  shore  in the usual  way.   On the  completion of the northernbank,  the  southern bank could  be constructed without difficulty in practically still water.    190.   When  the   two  side  banks  were  completed,  the spacebetween them would be  filled  with  sealing material to render thework watertight.   In  view of the abnormal width of the embankmentthe  consulting engineers think  that  sand of suitable  quality would form a satisfactory  material  for  the  purpose.   There are severalbanks of fine sand in the immediate neighbourhood.  Alternatively,the  embankment might  be sealed by  depositing clay between therubble banks in conjunction with stone, but the consulting engineersdo not consider that this woidd be as  satisfactory as  sand.  The inner,slopes of the two rubble banks  would  require to be coated with gravelor other similar material in order to choke the interstices in the rubbleand  thus prevent the sand from being withdrawn from the  embank-
merit.  The consulting engineers are confident that this work would eventually become  practically watertight,  and that any  settlement,which  might occur, especially in  the  earlier  stages, could be made good without difficulty.   191.   The up-stream and down-stream faces of the embankmentswould be protected  with stone or other suitable, pitching.  A concreteparapet wall would be constructed along the  up-stream edge of the embankment adjoining the  footpath,  and there would  be  subwayfor water mains, telegraph cables, &amp;C.,  beneath.        (v)  Railway and  road  viaducts  and lifting bridges.   192.   The  general  arrangement  by  which  railway  and  roadcommunication would be established between the eastern and westernshores  is  shown on  the  general  plan (appendix, drawing   no. 3).Between the English shore and the locks, the railway and road wouldbe supported on viaducts constructed across the English Stones.  Toavoid interruption of traffic when  the locks were in use, the  railway and roads would cross both the  up-stream and down-stream ends ofthe locks.   The direct line both for the railway and road would becarried to the  north  end of the locks,  which would be crossed bylifting bridges.   Starting at a point about 3,000 ft. east of the locks,a branch railway would be carried to the south end of the locks whichwould be bridged in like manner.   The road would be provided with similar facilities for crossing the  locks at either  end, by diversionsformed along the eastern and western sides of the locks.  The  railwayviaduct is arranged to take the ordinary  main line double track,  andthe scheme for the road  viaduct  provides for a road  28 ft.  widebetween kerbs  and a footpath  10 ft.  in width.   The rail level  and road level have been fixed at 4-88  ft. O.D.  The viaduct piers arespaced generally about  155 ft,  8  in. apart centre to centre.  Theyhave a length of 84 ft., and a width of 18 ft. at the top where theycarry both railway and road.   The piers  have been shaped  with  aview to facilitating the  flow  of  water  past them.   198.   The railway and roads would be taken across the two endsof the  locks on single-leaf bridges of the rolling lift type electricallyoperated.   Separate bridges  would be provided for the  railway  andthe road,  and two would, therefore, be required  at each end  of eachlock. -  For  reasons of  economy,  the width  of  the  road and  thefootpath  on the bridges  has  been reduced  to  20 ft. and 5  ft.respectively.  Between the locks on the western shore the rails  and road would  be  carried on the embankment dam.   194.   The interlocking and signalling arrangements to be adoptedin connection with  the rail and  road traffic, both in relation  to eachother and  as  affecting  navigation  through the locks, are obviouslyof great importance and will require the most  careful  consideration at a later stage.   195.   The  general  arrangements  and  levels  in regard  to  theroad and railway communications  have been  discussed informallywith the  Ministry of  Transport  (paragraph  119) and the GreatWestern Railway Company (paragraph 126) respectively.                 (vi) The  execution of  the works.   196.   Having regard to the magnitude of  the complete  scheme,it is  essential,  if  its construction $s  to be  carried out  within  areasonable period, that operations should be conducted simultaneouslyat as many separate points as may  be practicable.   To this end,communication from  the shore to the  proposed navigation locks  and both ends of the turbine  dam site should be  established as soon aspossible.  As,  however, existing  navigation requirements must notbe interfered with until alternative  facilities for shipping have beenafforded,  it is  clear that such  communication  cannot  be permittedfrom the  western  shore.   197.   The construction of the sluice dam and railway  and roadviaducts would  provide the  requisite  access,  but  in order to avoiddelay the construction in  the first place of a temporary viaduct orstaging on a line parallel with the  site of the permanent viaduct, thusconnecting  the  eastern shore with  the  site of the locks, would bedesirable  in order to afford  facilities at  as early  a stage as possible
for the transportation of the materials necessary for the constructionof the temporary coffer dam required  to enclose the site of the locks,and also the materials necessary for the locks and the viaduct.   Thetemporary coffer dam required to enclose the site of the locks should then be constructed of sufficient height to exclude the tide so  as toallow the work of lock construction  to proceed.  This temporary dammight conveniently consist of concrete blocks which could be readilyset and removed.  When the area thus enclosed had been dewatered,the work of constructing the locks  could be  begun,  work  being concentrated  in  the  first  place on  the building of the eastern wallof Lock No. 1 and the western wall of Lock No. 8.    198.  As  soon as  these  walls  were  completed,  they could bejoined up to the northern and southern walls of the temporary  cofferdam and thus be used for the  exclusion of water from the site.   Itwould then be possible  for the  eastern  and western walls of  thetemporary dam to be removed so that the materials therefrom  could be  utilised for  the  construction  of  temporary  works  required  inconnection  with  the turbine dam.    199.  The construction of the  sluice  dam could be undertakensimultaneously  with  the work  described above.   The  consulting engineers propose that this work also  should be executed insidetemporary coffer dams.   A sufficient  length of coffer dam to enclose(say) a  group of  ten sluice dam  piers could be  built.   While thislength of the permanent work was  in progress,  a  further similarlength of coffer dam could  be  prepared  for the next  section of thework.  When the first length of permanent work had been sufficientlycompleted,  and while the second length was under construction, thefirst length of coffer dam could be removed and rebuilt in readiness for the  third length, and so on.   Materials sufficient for two suchlengths  of  coffer dam would accordingly  be required.    200.  Experience would show  whether progress under such  anarrangement would  be sufficiently rapid, or whether longer  cofferdams should  be  provided.   Although   it might  be desirable  toconstruct the sluice dam with all possible speed, it  would be necessaryto avoid creating  any undue obstruction  to the ebb and  flow of thetide over the English Stones.    201.  If the  foregoing  method of  procedure  were  adopted, itwould be possible  within  a reasonable time after beginning the workto proceed simultaneously with the construction  of the sluice dam,entrance locks  and turbine  dam.    202.  As regards the turbine dam, it would be desirable to startwork at its  northern end  joining the locks.  On the  completion,however, of  the  sluice  dam  and the materials of  the  temporarycoffer dams for the  latter  becoming available,  the construction ofthe southern end  of the  turbine dam could be started.   Thereafter,the work would  proceed at both&apos; ends,  simultaneously.   The  work would be carried  out in stages of,  say, 500 ft. inside  temporarycoffer dams in the manner proposed above for the sluice dam.. Itwould be difficult and costly  to  undertake the  excavation for theforebay and tail bay of the turbines under water.  The width  of thecoffer dams should,  therefore,  be such as to permit, if possible, thedeeper excavations to be carried out within them.    208.  The  designs for the temporary  coffer dams would require careful   consideration so as  to   render  practicable the repeatedtemporary  use of the material of which  they  were composed,  andalso to  enable the  concrete  blocks, if  possible,  to be  embodiedultimately  in the  permanent works.    204.  In the case of the viaduct;  with its isolated piers, the most economical  and convenient method wordd probably be  to constructeach pier independently, work being carried on  during such  hours in each  tide as the rock  surface is bare.   In  the  construction  of thelower portions  of tho  piers,  this would  involve  pumping out. thewater from the foundation pits before the work on each tide began.As the viaducts could, not be used for normal road and railway trafficbefore the locks and  the  embankment dam were completed, it  wouldbe advisable to defer their  construction in order that they might be constructed simultaneously with the embankment dam.
   205.  We  have  already  explained   the  methods  which  theconsulting   engineers   consider   should   be  adopted   for   theconstruction   of   the   embankment  dam.    In  view   of   therequirements  of  navigation,  the   progress   made  with   this work  would,  however, largely depend   upon  the  progress madewith the locks and upon the available amount  of excavated materials from the works  required  in  its construction.   As the embankmentdam was raised across the channel and the main ebb and flood streamsbecame increasingly obstructed, a time would come when any furtherheightening of the  work would  cause  inconvenience to  shipping.Before, therefore, proceeding beyond this  stage  with the embankment,it would be necessary to provide facilities for the passage of shippingthrough the locks.   The  general programme  of construction must,therefore, be  arranged with  this consideration  in view.   206.  Before navigation across the site of  the embankment damwas finally stopped,  it would  be necessary for  at least  Lock No. 1and for the two large guide piers to be  completed in every respect,and for the remainder of the works on  the locks to be suffiently advanced to allow the removal of the temporary coffer dam.   the embankment to the north-east of the locks  together with the fillingbetween Locks Nos. 1 and 2 should also  have  been completed.   207.  The construction  of  the  embankment dam  would  be resumed and  carried on  with the utmost speed, when  the  lockshad been completed.  Until these works  had been brought up to thelevel of  high water, cross-currents,  depending  upon the state ofthe tide, might be  anticipated in  the  neighbourhood of both thenorth and south entrances to the locks.  These might  be sufficiently strong  to interfere with shipping using the locks.  The embankmentprojecting north of the locks and the northern guide piers might,however, be expected to afford very appreciable protection from  thesecurrents to vessels entering or leaving the locks at the upstream end.For  similar reasons it would  be  extremely  desirable that  at thisstage a  length  of  some  1,000 or  1,500 ft. of the turbine dammeasured from the locks should have reached  a sufficiently advanced stage to protect  the  downstream entrances of  the locks.   208.  The disposal of the materials from  the  excavations  foruse in  the construction of  the various embankments and filling wouldbe very important and would require careful consideration.  It might,however, be found practicable to use the excavated  material  fromthe foundations of the sluice  dam to form a reclamation area on theeastern bank of the  river between the sluice  dam and the viaducts,the top surface  being  placed  at  say  + 80 ft. O.D. and having an approximate width of at least 200  ft. with a pitched  slope  towardsthe river.  This area would be about 16-5 acres in extent upon whichdwellings for the  barrage  staff could be  constructed  or work-yards be established, any surplus material being used to extend thearea towards the railway or elsewhere as  might be found desirable.   209.  The excavated material from the foundations of the entrancelocks  should  be  used  to  form  the   adjacent  embankment  andreclamation area north and east of Lock No. 1, and  for the fillingbetween the locks.   To complete these works, however,  it would benecessary to obtain  from the excavation  for the turbine dam thebalance of the materials required.  The excavated materials from theturbine dam could also be used to form a  further reclamation areawest of Lock  No. 8 on the  English  Stones above low-water mark.This area would ultimately form part of  the embankment dam.   Thebalance of the excavated material could then be  used for the  purposeof blocking the deep  portion  of the  Shoots  up  to a level of say -80 ft. O.D., should navigation permit.   The construction of thisreclamation area would  be the first  stage in  the  building of the embankment dam of which it would form the lower portion at thepoint where it crosses the Shoots.  The materials excavated from the foundations of the piers for the viaducts would  also be available forblocking  up  the  Shoots  or,  alternatively,  for  extending thereclamation area referred to  above.   210. All  the materials   from  the  excavations of  the works,exclusive of dredged materials, would be disposed of  if  used in the manner suggested  above.   It is,  therefore, desirable  to considerwhere   the  materials for  the completion of  the  embankment  dam
 could be obtained and how it should be constructed.  After the deep part of the  Shoots had been  successfully blocked up to  -80 ft. O.D. and when the shipping had  been diverted through  Lock No. 1, the construction of the  embankment dam could be resumed.  A  pilot bank should be constructed on the up-stream side of  the embankment dam from the locks to the western shore, in order to break the force of the tidal stream and to enable the  rest of the work to be carried out in reasonably quiet water.   The pilot banks should be of rubble obtained from quarries.  This would probably require to be deposited in the form of gabions over  a large part of the  work, at least in the lower portions.  Immediately the pilot bank was finished,  the rubble bank forming  the southern  side of  the embankment darn could be undertaken.  The part between the  level  -80 ft. O.D.  and, say. Ordnance Datum, could  be  constructed of  materials dredged  from the English Stones  down-stream of the turbine dam, the materials being  deposited   from  hopper  barges.  -The  upper portion  above Ordnance Datum which  could  not  conveniently be constructed of dredged materials deposited  from hopper  barges could  be made of rubble obtained from quarries and tipped from  wagons.   Before the completion  of  the southern  bank and in  order  to accelerate  con- struction, a rubble cross bank might be tipped between the northern pilot bank and the completed portion of the southern bank so as to form a  pocket into  which  sand filling forming  the core of  the embankment dam could be pumped.   After  the first pocket had been filled the second  pocket formed on  the completion  of the southern bank to  the  western shore could  be filled,  thus completing  the embankment dam.   211.   The sand filling could  be dredged from the bed of the basin up-stream of the barrage by dipper  dredgers,  the material  being conveyed in hopper barges and  pumped therefrom into the embank- ment dam.   The dredging  plant could thus be usefully employed during  the  construction of the  embankment dam during the period before it would be required for the general excavation of the English Stones.  Up to the time of making the embankment dam impervious to the percolation of  water,  i.e., until the sand core had been coni- pleted up to high-water level it would  be  inadvisable to allow  the barrage to be used for impounding purposes.            (vii) The  excavation  of English  Stones, Ac.   212.   The configuration of  the English Stones and the existing general level of their  surface  would entail a loss  of head in the water passing over them.   The downward flow  of water to the turbines and  the upward flow  of water after passing  through the  sluice  dam openings would be impeded  accordingly, with a  resulting  diminution of the potential output of  power.   218.   In order to investigate this question, Professor Gibson  haa carried out a number  of experiments on a scale model of  the English Stones, specially  constructed for the purpose.  The  general outcome of his experiments leads to the conclusion that the expenditure  to be incurred in  excavating the English Stones to a level of -8 ft.  O.D. (paragraph  115) would be fully justified by the  increase of power output that would be obtained  thereby.   It might  even be found economical to remove the rock  to a somewhat  greater  depth,  say, -10 ft. O.D., but for the purpose of this report we have adopted  the level of - 8ft. O.D.   214.   Professor Gibson also  investigated the extent  to which it would be advisable to excavate the rock down-stream of the turbines so as  to facilitate their  discharge.   These  investigations  showed that, with levels of the turbine forebay  and  tailbay at  -86 ft.  O.D. and  -4955 ft. O.D., respectively, the rock  down-stream should beremoved to the  general  level  of  -35 ft.  O.D.   The  quantitiesinvolved,  after making due  allowance  for  uneven  excavation, are approximately 4,500,000  cubic  yards  in the case  of the English Stones and  2,500,000 cubic yards for  the  turbine discharge.   215.  Professor Gibson&apos;s experiments also embraced an investiga- tion into the length and position  of the guide pier south of the locks, and into  the question whether  it should be of solid or  openworkconstruction.  From  these it appears  that an  openwork  structureabout 750 ft. in length, placed  between Locks Nos.  1 and 2, would    [7972]
be likely to give satisfaction, and this arrangement has been adoptedin the scheme submitted.    216.   Owing  to  the strength of the. currents at  the  site,  themethod to  be employed for the excavation of the English Stoneswould have presented a rather difficult problem,  if it  had  not beenfound that it would  be  possible to postpone  this work until  the barrage works as a whole  were  sufficiently advanced  to retain  thewater in  the  impounding basin  at a level  permitting operations tobe  undertaken by  dredging  in comparatively  still  water  for  areasonable  period in each tide.    217.   On  the completion of the sluice dam, turbine dam, locks,and the greater  part of  the embankment  dam,  it could be easilyarranged  for  the water level  up-stream of the  barrage  not to beallowed to  drop  below, say,  -r-6  ft. O.D.,  even though  it would still be some considerable time before the scheme as a  whole  could beput into operation.   Under such an arrangement an  average periodof approximately 6 hours would  be available on each  tide for activedredging  operations  to -be conducted  on  the  site of  the  EnglishStones.   It is,  moreover,  improbable  that  the  whole of  the  72turbines  would be  put into  service when  the  scheme was first-completed,  and the water levels in the  impounding basin would not,therefore,  be  lowered to the full extent  described in paragraphs  141and 142 above.  A sufficient depth of water could, accordingly, beretained over the site to permit the dredging operations to be under-taken for  a reasonable period  in  each tide, even after  the powerscheme had begun to operate.    218.   Having regard to the character  of the surface rock,  itsremoval  would,  in   the  view  of  the  consulting  engineers,   be practicable  with  dredgers  of  the  dipper type,  and  this wouldcertainly   be   cheaper than  removal  by  other  methods.   Whiledredging    these   craft  could   work   on  spuds   in  the  usualway,  but,  at  the   end  of   each  working  period  and  beforethe rising  tide  was  admitted through  the sluice  dam openings,they  could  take  up  moorings  at  which   they  could  -remainuntil  the  dredging  operations could be resumed on the  followingtide.  In   order to  permit continuous  dredging throughout eachworking  period,  it  could  be arranged that  the  dredgers  shoulddischarge into self-propelling hopper barges, the design and capacityof  which would  be appropriate  (a)  to  the output  of the  dredgers, (b) to the openings between the piers of the railway and road viaductthrough which they would pass to and  from the dumping  ground. and (c) to the available depth  of water.    219.  Dredging could be undertaken  in the  first  place in  theimmediate  vicinity of the turbine  intakes,  and in working  eastward the  dredgers  and  barges  could be  gradually removed  from  the influence of the flow to the turbines.  The  estimates submitted have, therefore, been based on the assumption that a period of two years would be available to carry out the excavation of the English Stories. which would be required to give  improved access of  water to  the tiu-bines.   The remaining  part of the  proposed  excavation of  the English Stones is close to  the eastern  shore, and would be required to ease the flow of the water that bad  passed upward through  the sluice dam openings.  Its  execution could be deferred until a later date without  appreciable inconvenience, and the same dredging plant could be  employed.               ij    220.   The excavation  of the rock down-stream of the  turbines would be  more difficult and expensive,  owing partly  to its  situation and  partly to the fact that the work would have to be taken deeper. Further, at  these greater depths, the rock would be of  a harder character and would  probably require to be  broken up  before removal.The  consulting  engineers  consider,  however,  that   by  postponing the great bulk of this work until  the progress of the barrage works had reduced  the strength of currents at  this site,  no insuperable difficulty would  bo experienced  in the  adoption  of similar  methods to those  proposed for the removal of the rock on the  English Stones up-stream.  The  inconvenience  which would  be  caused  by  the turbine discharge  could be avoided, either by completing  the work of  rock  removal  before  the  turbines began  to  operate, or  by-arranging, in the  early stages of  generation, for a group or groups
of the turbines  to be kept inactive, thus enabling the rock removalto be carried out.   221.  The consulting  engineers, however,  chaw attention  to  thefact  that one of  the locks  must be made available for shipping beforethe  embankment dam can be brought up  above the  level at whichthere would  be  any possibility of causing  inconvenience  to existingnavigation  across its site.  It is essential, therefore, that  a sufficientquantity of excavation  should first have  been accomplished  in  the approaches to the locks in order to afford the requisite access  for-shipping.   222.  This work would have to be carried out while the strengthof the ebb and  flood streams at the site was  still very appreciable,and  it is doubtful whether the employment of floating craft for  thepurpose  would  be practicable.  It  would, therefore, be desirable to-avoid unnecessary excavation  and,  to this end, it is not proposedthat the rock at  this stage should be removed to a greater  depth than-15 ft. O.D.   This would  allow  the largest vessel now passing the site to  use the lock  for about 81 hours  at and around  high waterof any tide.   228.  If  these  arrangements  were  adopted,  the  quantity  ofexcavation  involved  would  be  comparatively   small approximately40,000 cubic yards.   Moreover,  at the depths in question the rockshould be readily disintegrated, and the excavation of  the  rock mightbe economically undertaken by hand in the dry when the tide suited.   224.  As  regards the materials required in the construction of  theworks, our inquiries show  that  the conditions in the surroundingdistrict are favourable.  The  rock excavated from the English Stones,.however, would  not be likely to be suitable for concrete,  at any rateuntil the lower strata were reached.   The  consulting  engineers have-had  surface samples  examined and, although the stone should  form asatisfactory foundation,  the report on it as  an ingredient for concreteis unfavourable.  Nevertheless,  ample  supplies of gravel,  sandstonesand  limestones  exist in the neighbourhood.   Suitable sand  is  also available and could be obtained by water carriage.  Granite for lockentrances,  copings,  etc.,  could  be procured from Cornwall,  blue or-brindle  bricks for facing the lock walls and suitable stone for facing the piers, sills and aprons of the sluice dam, the piers of  the viaductand  the external face  of the turbine  dam, are  obtainable  in  the-district.   225.  It may be  concluded from the geological reports summarised in section  IV  of this  report (paragraphs 49-70) that  the upperportions  of the English Stones, in which the sluice dam  and viaductpiers would be founded,  could be readily excavated, that probably littletrouble  wpuld be experienced in the excavations due to  the  generalpercolation of water through  the strata, and that, although somewhatfriable,  they should be  capable  of satisfactorily withstanding  the pressures likely to be brought upon the foundations.  The thickness ofthe Triassic sandstone of the English Stones is not everywhere known,.but the geological reports show that a trial bore on the  western  margin of the English Stones disclosed alternating beds  of sandstone and marlto a  depth of 85  feet resting on Pennant Grit.  The boring  was  carried85 feet into the grit and if, as is probable, the level from which  theboring was taken was about  Ordnance Datum, the  Pennant  Gritextends from about  -85  ft. O.D. to at least  -70 ft. O.D.   226.  As the deepest  foundations  of the  navigation  locks  will&apos;probably  not  exceed  -45  ft.  O.D.,  and  of  the turbine  dam-55 ft.  O.D., there should be no cause for anxiety in regard to thequality  of the foundations to be expected.  It is unlikely that therewould be encountered a general percolation of water,  on  a scale thatwould unduly increase  the amount of pumping required  to keep  theexcavations dry.  If, however, such percolation was  encountered,  itwould probably be possible greatly to reduce, if not completely prevent it, by a cementation process.  This would apply more particularly tothe comparatively large area of excavation which would be open whenconstructing the navigation locks, but would also be applicable,  though in a less degree, to the excavations in connection with the turbine  andsluice dams.[7972]
   227.   The consulting engineers think it would he prudent, before final details of the design were prepared, that a series of deep boringsshould be made along the proposed lines of the works,  although suchan investigation would, under the conditions which prevail at the site.necessarily be expensive.VIII. MECHANICAL  AND   ELECTRICAL  EQUIPMENT                        REQUIRED.    228.   The   fact  that   the  maximum  working  head  in  thescheme does not exceed 85 ft., necessitates the use of some form ofpropeller-type turbine in order to obtain a reasonably high speed ofrotation.  Such turbines may be of the fixed-blade type, in which thevanes of the turbine are fixed  in their boss, or of the movable bladetype, in which  the vanes  may be rotated while the turbine is inoperation.   The turbine which we  recommend  is of the  latter type(paragraph  151).    229.   Under the  conditions  existing in the tidal power scheme,with a working  head  varying from 5 feet to 85  feet,  the difficulty ofdesigning a constant-speed  fixed blade turbine to give a reasonably-high average efficiency over the whole working range is very  great.owing to the fact that  if the angles of the impeller vanes are correct forone bead  and the corresponding discharge, they are incorrect for allother heads.    230.   In this  respect the  selected  turbine,  in which the runnervanes may be rotated  so as to give, at all heads, approximately correctvane angles, is  much superior.  Generally, its  advantages, as corn-pared with the  fixed-blade type, may be summarised as follows :     (1) Its over all efficiency is  higher.  At the  low heads which obtain          towards the beginning and  end of the working period, the          efficiency is much higher than that of the fixed-blade type,          and this efficiency is maintained at  much lower discharges          than  is  the case with  the latter  type.  &apos; This  has  two          advantages.  Less water is used at these low heads and the          water thus  saved can be  used under  the higher  heads          available near the middle of the working period, where  it          is capable of developing more power.   Also,  the flow- may be          reduced without such a large loss of output,  towards the end          of the working period,  where, owing  to the low level, the          friction  loss due  to  flow over the English Stones is most          serious.   Because of this a lower low-water level can be          adopted  in  the tidal basin, or,  with the  same  low-water          level, a smaller amount of excavation is  required over the          English  stones  than  if fixed-blade  turbines  were  to be          adopted.    (2) The selected turbine offers greater possibilities in  the way ol          flexibility of operation.  It is capable of carrying greater          overloads,  enabling a number of units to be laid off for          repair without the same necessity for providing spare units.    (8) There  is reason  to believe that the operation of starting up-       would be  easier  and simpfer  with  turbines  of  the type       selected.(4)  The  necessity,  or strong desirability,  of  a duplicate safety       device in any type of turbine  necessitates the provision,       in the fixed-blade turbine, of a  sluice gate capable of being       closed quickly in  case  the governor gear  should  fail  to       close the guide  vanes.   In  the  selected turbine  such a       duplicate safety  device  is  provided by  the  gearing  for       rotating the  blades, bringing them into the  closed position       and thereby  shutting down  the  turbine.   No permanent       sluice gate is necessary,  and provision need only be made       for an emergency gate winch can be placed in position by       a crane when it becomes necessary to shut down the turbine       for repairs.   The provision of  one  such gate  for each  ten       units is sufficient for all probable requirements.(a)  The type of turbine.number  of  units  involved
   &quot;281.   The disadvantages of the type of turbine selected  are  asfollows:    (1) the greater mechanical complexity,  involving a greater risk          of breakdown and increased maintenance.   (2) the greater cost.   232.   As  regards  the  former,   experience,  which  has  beenaccumulating  rapidly during recent years,  tends to show that thereis little reason to fear that maintenance charges would be appreciablygreater  than  with fixed-blade  turbines.   As  regards  the  cost, ifaccount be taken of the additional cost of the sluice gate and operatingmechanism required  with  the fixed-blade type,  the difference in costbecomes  very small.   The balance of  advantage appears  to  be withthe type of turbine selected.  Experience is available in regard to suchturbines  having runners up to 20 ft.   in diameter, and it would  bepossible to construct runners up to 80 ft. in diameter if necessary,   238.   Various considerations  need to  be taken into  account in determining  the best  diameter.   Other things  being  equal,  in  ascheme  requiring as  many units  as  the Severn barrage, the units should be as large  as possible,  since the efficiency  increases, andthe cost per  unit of output diminishes, with the size  of the  turbine.Further,  the  length  of dam  necessary to  house  a given  aggregatehorse-power  of  turbines  becomes less as  the  size of the  unit is increased. On the other hand the cross-section of the dam,  and the depth of  the turbine  outlets and of the foundations increase rapidlywith an  increase  in  size.   On the whole,  taking into account the physical characteristics of the site, a runner diameter of approximately20 ft. appeared  to  offer  the  greatest advantage, and this size ofunit has  therefore been selected.   23-1.   The experimental investigations  carried out by the turbinemanufacturers at  their works, have resulted in the development ofa turbine having a remarkably high efficiency over the whole range of working heads.  The working speed is 62\5 revolutions per minute,and  at this speed the  maximum  efficiency exceeds 90 per cent, forall heads between 14 ft.  and  30 ft. attaining  a maximum value of91-6 per  cent., while at a  head of  6 feet it is 79-2 per cent.   235.   The values of the water discharges, efficiencies, and  brakehorse-powers have been calculated  for all heads from 5 ft. to 85 ft. withmaximum suction heads respectively of -4 ft., +0 ft..  ^- 4 ft. and-f8 ft.   286.   The water is taken  to the  turbine  through  a   concretespiral channel.   The approach to this  is divided into three parts  by two  vertical  walls.   The width of each section is 14-5  ft.  and themaximum height  33&apos;5 ft.,  the  total  area being  1,457  sq.  ft.Provision  is made in this portion of  the  channel for housing thetemporary sluice  gates which would  be required in  case of  repairto the turbine.   287:   The  draft  tube  of  the  turbine  has  been  designed  inaccordance with the results of model tests.  It  has a  width of 44 ft.and  an  arched roof  and invert.   The  maximum  depth at the  outletis 25-2 ft. and the effective discharge area approximately 1,000 sq. ft.Provision is  made, at  the draft  tube  outlet, for housing temporarysluice gates when these are required.   288.   The question of corrosion  of the turbine  blades  due  tothe fact  that  these will operate  in salt water  has been considered,and  the   estimates of cost are based   on  the  use of stainless  steelblades;(b) Provision for dewatering the  turbines  and  providing aooess for                      inspection  and  repairs.   239.   We estimate  that several turbines might perhaps be out otaction simultaneously  for overhaul  and   repair.   Provision  has.therefore, been made  in the estimates for sluice gates to close the headand  tail races of such turbines so  as to enable  the turbine chambersto-be pumped out and the space left clear and dry for the workmen tocarry out any necessary repairs,  not only to the turbines, but  to themasonry, brickwork and concrete in the chambers.
    240.   Provision is made in the estimate for electric pumps whichcan be switched on whenever it is essential to pump out the chambers.The sluice gates referred to above are capable of being withdrawn fromtheir grooves and can be transported to any turbine head and tail  raceby means of the operating crane which travels from end to end of theturbine dam.                     (o)  Electrical equipment.    241.   In the  following paragraphs  we show how  the electricalenergy is to be generated, and  also how the  energy is  to be madeavailable for distribution to the 182,000 volt grid.    242.   The  normal capacity of the plant  at the barrage would be somewhat  in  excess  of  three-quarters  of   a  million  kilowatts(777,600  kws.).  The total plant is divided into  8  blocks, so  that each block would have  a normal capacity just  short of 100,000 kws.(97,200 kws.).  These blocks of power would be absorbed by the  gridand distributed to different parts of the country.    243.   Each block of  power  would   consist  of 9 water  turbine-driven alternators when the required output is to be 100.000 kws..but this number  would be reduced  when the pre-determined output is less than this  figure.  The water turbines and alternators wouldbe  of  the vertical  shaft  type,  generating 8-phase 50-periods at11,000 volts.   In order to minimise building  costs the alternatorshave been designed  to  operate in the open.  The generated voltageof 11,000  is to  be stepped  up through transformers to the distributingvoltage of  132,000.   The  block of power  from  each group ofalternators would be switched  by a single  132,000 volt automaticoil  switch.  Each of the eight blocks would be standardised and so arranged  that  each  block of power is  entirely  independent of the others.    244.   In  order to provide energy  to operate the  sluice  gates,.the motor generator sets, various  oil  and  water pumps, the  lockcaissons and bridges, &amp;c, and for lighting  purposes,  a constantauxiliary supply of energy is  required, whether the water conditionsare suitable  for  power production  or  not.   This auxiliary supply is to be obtained from the grid through suitable step  down  trans-formers  in  the  service  station,  situated  at  the   north   endof the  turbine  dam,  and  will be distributed along the  turbine dam,.sluice dam and to the locks and bridges  at a pressure  of 11,000 volts.The auxiliary supply to the turbine dam and sluice dam  will be dealtwith at 8  sub-stations on the turbine dam, these sub-stations being arranged in pairs so  that  4 buildings will be required to contain the requisite plant, and  these four  buildings have  been called turbinedam stations.    245.  From the  southernmost  of the  turbine  dam  stations  the-auxiliary supply  is further  distributed along the sluice  dam to  two-sub-stations situated thereon, which have been called  sluice damstations.   The  auxiliary power for the locks and bridges  will  be dealtwith at the locks and bridges sub-station  to  be situated  betweenlocks 2 and 8, and  will be  controlled from a  control room at  thatsub-station.  For most of  the equipment  the  auxiliary supply at11,000 volts will  be further reduced to 440  volts  in  the varioussub-stations.    246.  The.  control  of the bio cks of power as well  as  of  the auxiliary supply  will be from a main  control  station by means ofa  supervisory  control system.   The main  control  station will besituated on  the embankment  north  of the turbine dam and  east ofthe locks.    IX. ESTIMATE  OF THE  COST  OF   THE  SCHEME.   247.  Having satisfied ourselves that a power barrage could be constructed  at  the  English Stones  site,  and  having examined the plans proposed for the civil engineering works,  turbines and electricalmachinory,  we are  now in a  position to determine  what would bethe cost of generating electricity by  means of the tidal power in the-Severn estuary.   The scheme has many unquestionable advantages.These  include  improved  railway  and  road  connection between
7152England and  south Wales,  thereby  relieving the congestion of  the severn Tunnel and shortening the road to south Wales by  50 miles in lieu of  the existing northerly deviation  through Gloucester.   Itwould provide also improved facilities for navigation.  All these  areof  great  national  importance,  but  none  would  probably  be economically  practicable  except  as a part of a general  scheme  forthe construction of a power barrage.   The value of the electricalenergy derivable from the  barrage becomes  therefore of  paramount importance.   The  question to  be  answered is whether electricalenergy can be obtained  from the tidal power at a  price comparable to that of  electricity produced by a coal-fired generating  station.                     (a)  The cost of  the works.   248.  The consulting  engineers have prepared a summary of  theestimated costs allocated  to each service,   i.c, the barrage, the roadviaduct,  the railway viaduct, the navigation locks  and the harbourworks.   249.  The consulting engineers have furnished us  with a detailedabstract  of their estimate  of  the  cost of the whole  of  the works(including  machinery) that would be required.  On the basis of these estimates,  the consulting  engineers  have  prepared   the  followingsuggested allocation of the total cost of  the works as between thevarious interests concerned (table 8).

The above  estimates  include  12i  per  cent,  on  the  net estimated  cost as an  allowance  for contingencies which we  consider ample.  No provision  has, however, been made for the  acquisition of lands and  Parliamentary expenses.    251.  The consulting engineers estimate that a sum  of  approxi- mately : 16,000,000 would be required for masonry works, buildings, and  temporary  works, and 1:12,000,000  for steel and ironwork, machinery, electrical  equipment, dredging  plant, &amp;c, the orders for the supply of which would provide a substantial volume  of  employ - ment both for skilled^ and unskilled labour in this country.    252.  The time required  to carry out the whole of the works would be about 15 years.         (b)  The cost of electricity generated at the barrage.    258.  We turn now to consider what will be the  cost of production-of electricity  at  the barrage.   In the  following estimate,  we have assumed (a) that the works might begin  in five years&apos; time,  allowing for  preliminary  negotiations and the promotion  of a Government Hybrid Bill,  i.e., in  1987;  (b)&apos;that  a  period of 15  years would be required for  completion and bofore energy  could  be delivered to  the national  grid:  (o) that  the  average  rate of interest  would  not exceed  -1 per  cent;  on the presumption that a government guarantee would have to be  given to  works of such  magnitude  and  novelty; (d) that the loan  repayment period for  the permanent civil engineering
7-2structures would  be  75  years,  for heavy structural steel  and  themassive  turbines and  other heavy  machinery  (the  moving andwearable parts being dealt with  out of  revenue), 80 years, and forelectrical machinery and apparatus, 20 years, which,  we are informed,is the period normally allowed by the Electricity Commissioners to allauthorised undertakers.    254.  We  have also  assumed that the annual  output from  the barrage would be 2,252 million units, which is the carefully calculatedfigure  resulting from  the water  available at  varying heads,  taking into account  the  efficiency  of   the combined  turbine-alternators(paragraph 189).   Of  this amount probably  2 per cent,  would  berequired  for  operating  the   sluices,  starting  up  the  turbine sets,operating  cranes, travelling workshops,  and  ancillary  power andlighting.   The cost of  the power required by the  locks, roads and railway bridges. &amp;c,  would  be debited to the  authorities responsiblefor those services.    255.  The  estimated capital  cost.   20,334,000,  of  the  powerscheme (paragraph 249)  does not include capitalised interest  duringconstruction.   Since the constructional period is a long one, this itemwould be important and would increase the total cost to  25,457,500if the rate of interest is  4 per  cent, (it would be  26,208,900 at  4-J- percent, interest).    256.   The consulting engineers and our secretary have examined the yearly commitments with  much  care, and  the following table(table  9) sets  out their  estimate of  the expenditure that would berequired year by year during  the  period of construction.

After  careful inquiry, we  have concluded that 4 per cent. may be safely taken as the average rate of interest.  The total cost of the scheme could be reduced, if only one lock of the broader type was constructed  in the first  instance  (but with  provision made  for  the entrances of the other two).  It is estimated that after account is taken of compound interest at 4% during construction, the saving so effected would be about  2 millions.    260.  On  the  foregoing  assumptions,   the  estimated  cost  of generating electrical  energy would be as follows:     Civil      engineering      works                                     (75  years)  .........  15,848,200x42229% =647,928    Steel    work    and    turbines        (30  years)  .........    6,893,500x5-783% =869,788    Electrical    engineering   work        (20  years)  .........    8,720,800 x 7-3582% =278,78825,457,500Total  capital chargesRepairs and maintenance of works and plant     Civil engineering works \ per cent.

On an output  of 2,252 million units the cost per unit wouldbe 0&apos;178d.  Allowing 2 per cent, of tho total output for  internal usein operating sluice motors, other auxiliaries  and for excitation, thenet output for revenue earning purposes would be 2,207 million units and the average cost per unit sent out to transmission lines would boincreased  to  0-1765d.   At the  expiration  of 75  years,  when  the debt on  permanent  civil engineering  structures had  boen  paid off and on the assumption (which is probable)  that these works would still remain in  workable condition for many  decades thereafter, theworking  costs would  be  reduced by  647,928 per annum and the net cost per  unit  sent out to 0106d.
7554    262.   Owing  to the intermittent output  of the energy derivablefrom  the barrage,  if not combined  with  some storage scheme,  nosaving in the amount of steam plant installed at other power stations would be possible.   Moreover,  steam pressure would have  to  bemaintained  in  the  necessary  number of boilers though legulated to-some extent during the recurring 61 hours to 8-hour periods duringwhich the barrage plant would be working.  No saving in wages, &amp;c,at the coal-fired  stations would  be possible.  Thus  the comparison of the intermittent supply&apos;  from the barrage with a supply  from a coal-fired station  should properly be based on the saving of coal andthat alone.    268.   In 1930,  the average weight  of coal per  unit  generated atcoal-fired stations having an  annual output  of  over  5 million  unitsamounted to 1&apos;867  lbs.  If, howrever, there was no  secondary storagestation the supply of  electricity from the barrage would, as we haveshown, vary greatly on account of the tides,  both in  the time of day that it would be  available and in the amount generated.   It would therefore not be  possible at all times to utilise  the supply from thobarrage to deal with peak periods of demand, and to meet these it would still be necessary  at coal-fired stations to provide for standby and bank-ing losses.  These in  1980 amounted to 6 - per cent,  of the total coalused.  The  weight of coal per unit sent to transmission lines at thatdate should  therefore, for the  purposes of the present comparison, bereduced  to  175  lbs.  The  then  average  cost  of coal per tonin  the   Midlands district was 11s.   id.,  and  the   equivalent costof  coal  per unit  sent  out  only  0-1063d.    In  the  South-east england and Southern districts the cost is more of the order of 18s.per ton,  and  the equivalent  cost per unit  sent out 0&apos;1688d.  Theconsumption of coal  per  unit must inevitably  be sensibly reduced from  the  above-mentioned  record  for  1980  when  the central electricity Board&apos;s system is fully  in  commission  and it is  clearthat on simple  economic grounds electricity generated by the primarytidal  turbines  at the barrage at the cost  estimated  above  cannotcompete  with  electricity  generated  at  selected coal-fired stations.There is,  of  course,   the  national  point  of  view  that   some(2,252 millions x 1-867 lbs., or)  1,877,000 tons of  coal per  annumwould not  be  consumed  in   producing  electricity,  and  would  beavailable for export or  other economic  use.    264.   Assuming that  the barrage were  completed  by the year1952  the then  national consumption of electricity may be  estimated to be, say,  80,000 million  units per annum with  a load factor ofsome  88  per cent. The maximum load would be some 10 million kilo-watts and at the  time of maximum load when the maximum outputirom the  barrage coincided, the barrage would contribute a little under8 per cent, of  the  total  load.   The load  diagram for the southern and midland parts of  the country is shown in the appendix (figure  5),from  which  it will be  seen that the night load is only one-sixth of themaximum load  recorded, say, 1*66 million kilowatts.   It is barelyconceivable  that  when the load from the barrage coincided with the times of least load  in the  country,  one  source  of  supply  only would be relied upon for 50  per cent, of  that load.   It is probablethat at such periods the barrage  would not be worked  to its fulloutput,  and the  annual  output would, therefore, be reduced below2,207 millions.   Since the bulk of the annual costs  are fixed charges,the cost  per unit sent  out would necessarily be  increased beyond0-1765d. (see paragraph 261).    265.   It is  clear, therefore,  that unless suitable  means  can  be devised by which a secondary storage system may be added so  as to-smooth out the irregularity of the tidal power, the  scheme is noteconomically practicable.(o) The  cost of constructing  a secondary storage system and of the                     electricity  so generated.    266.   Two  storage methods have been suggested to us.  One isthe provision of  a  high-level reservoir or reservoirs to which the barrage  plant would  pump  water during the operation of the  tidalturbines.  The high-level water  so obtained could  in turn drive a set of socondary hydro-electric  plant and  thus provide a  24-hoursupply of electricity.    [7972]                                               i* 2
    267.   The second is the conversion of some 8/5ths of the total-energy available from the barrage into heat for thermal storage and subsequent utilisation in steam turbines.   Primd facie,  this secondproposal on so extensive a scale does  not appear to be practicable,and we  have, therefore, not minutely  examined  this  method  of storage.    268.   Turning to the first proposal, we find that when in 1920the  Ministry of  Transport  prepared  a  scheme for  the  Severn.they  selected a site  for  an elevated reservoir at Trelleck  Grange,with  an inlet  for pumping water from the river  Wyo at a  point about  8J- miles above Beachley Point.  This site would  necessitate a  pumping main just over 2 miles in  length from  the river  to  the site of the reservoir.  It was proposed that the reservoir should havea  top  water level of 500 ft. above  Ordnance Datum.  Its bottomwould be at a level  of  800 ft. above  Ordnance  Datum at the endnearest the dam.    269.   The  maximum height of  the dam would,  therefore,  be over 200 ft.  This reservoir was to have an area of about 750 acres,and contained between the  levels of 500 and 450 ft.  above OrdnanceDatum 58,800,000 cubic yards of water  having an effective headabove  the power house  of  440  ft.   The energy stored between  the levels  of 500 and 450 ft.  would amount to 20,444,000 BT.P.  hours.Between  the levels  of  450  and  400  ft.  there is storage for  anadditional  18,500,000 cubic yards of  water with  an effective headabove  the  power  house of 400 ft.   The energy stored between these levels  would be 6,466,000 H.P. hours, and  thus  the  total energystored between the levels of 500 and 400  ft. above Ordnance Datumwould be 26,910,000 H.P. hours.    270.   For the purpose of investigating the problem  of storagethe output of the primary turbines has been computed for each tideof a mean lunar  cycle.

A compounded diagram showing the tidal power curve andthe suggested electrical output curve  with  a load factor of approxi-mately 84 per cent, is shown on diagram no. 6 in the appendix.    272.   If  it is assumed, as  shown in  the diagram  referred  toabove, that a part of the total  energy is delivered direct from the primary  tidal plant to the national  transmission  lines, and that theremainder of the available  energy is  utilised  for pumping into thissecondary reservoir,  then allowing 74 per cent, efficiency  for thepumping operations over  a varying  load,  and an  efficiency of 81 percent, in  the  utilisation of the  high-level turbine plant, with thescheme of operation  outlined, 845  million units would be available from the secondary  station  plus 798 million  units direct from the primary  plant at the barrage, representing a total output  of  1,648million units per annum, or 74-5 por  cent, of  the total energy  avail-able at the barrage from tidal power.  Also calculations show that the storage reservoir would require  to  have  a capacity of 20-5 millionH.P. hours,  which  is  almost exactly the  capacity offered by theTrelleck Grange  site  between the levels of 500 and 450  ft.
   278.   Owing  to the reduced  output,  the primary cost at the barrage  would  be  increased  from  the  figure  previously  stated,namely,  0-1765d. to 0-2372d. per unit.   274.   The average load  factor  throughout the  country at thepresent time, is 88  per  cent, measured at the generating  stations.The  average cost of generating electricity at  good coal-fired stations to-day is about L&apos;8 per kilowatt demanded phis 0&apos;14d. per unit, whichis equivalent to 0-875d. per unit delivered to lines at a load factor of 34  per cent.,  which is the improved load factor  that  may beanticipated.  The  difference  between the cost at  the  barrage andthis  figure is 0-1878d. per unit, in favour of the barrage.   275.   At  0-875(i.  per  unit,  the  annual  cost  of  producing1,648  million units would be  2,567,188, which is  948,819  morethan the  estimated  annual cost of generating the primary power atthe barrage.   276.   The  annual cost of the main  scheme  as shown In theprevious  tables,  including operation  costs and capital  charges,  is688 per cent, of the total capital cost (paragraphs 256 to 259).   277.   Assuming that this ratio between annual  costs and capitalexpenditure  would  hold   for  the   secondary   installation,   then 14,800,000 could be expended on the latter  before the total annual cost  would  exceed that of a coal-fired  station producing the  sameoutput at the like load factor.  The preliminary  estimate (table 18)suggests  that a  secondary plant could probably be provided at a cost, of  10-255 million excluding capitalised interest, but including an allowance for engineering  fees and  contingencies.

With  capitalised  interest,  the  cost would   grow  to  atotal  of   11,468,901.  as  will be  seen  from  the  following  table(table  14):-                            TABLE  14.Estimated rate of expenditure on the construction of the secondary             storage  station, plus  compound  interest.Engineering  fees  and contingenciesTears.&apos; ,.Works-j 75 years.

    279.   There still remains a  provision to be made for increasedtransmission lines to distribute this  load to areas in which the loadcan be absorbed.  The transmission lines now being constructed by theCentral Electricity Board are each designed to transmit  50,000 kilo-watts, but these will be  required almost entirely for the distribution ofloads among the selected stations already provided.   To distribute afurther 550,000 kilowatts would necessitate the addition of not less than five double-circuit lines connecting the primary and  secondary  power stations of the barrage to the Metropolitan, Central England,  SouthWales and South-West England areas and must entail the construc-tion of some 400 miles  of double line.  The capital cost of these lines and the necessary 182 K.V. transforming sub-stations is estimatedat   8,000,000.  It would not, however, be  fair to debit  this scheme with  the  whole cost of the extra transmission lines, since,  as thenational load grows  and the sites for efficient coal-fired stations withnecessary condensing water  facilities  become increasingly difficult tofind,  extra transmission lines will have to be constructed, whether inconnection with further coal-fired stations or with this barrage, andan  allowance must be made  for the cost of the additional lines  whichwould be  required in connection with the further coal-fired stations.For example, the distance between the barrage stations and suitablepoints of  delivery in the metropolitan area  is about 100 miles, andit has been assumed that 200,000 kilowatts out of the 550,000 kilowattsavailable  would be transmitted to the South-East  England district.Equivalent coal-fired plant 20 yrears  hence, when metropolitan river-side sites will have been fully  occupied, will probably be situatedwell away from London itself, say in the Kent coal-fields, when the transmission distance will  be not  less than 60 miles.   A careful review of the  comparative  situations of the  various stations leadsus  to think  that a  fair  appropriation of these excess transmissionlines   required  by  the  barrage  would  be  one-half  of  the  aboveestimated cost,  namely,  1,500,000    280.   Thus  the  total  cost of providing the secondary equipment and the proportion  of  the  increased transmission  system would  be 12,968,901, say  13,000,000.   Adopting  the  same basis  as  inparagraph 277,  for the ratio  between annual costs  and  capitalexpenditure  for the  secondary plant  and for the extra transmissionlines, viz., 6&quot;88 per  cent., as that obtained for. the primary plant theannual proportional  cost  would  be  827.416.  with  a total capital of 12,968,901.    281.   In making the above estimate, we have made no allowance for the probability  that  much  of the output of the  scheme  wouldbe  absorbed  locally  by  industries attracted by  the  facilities afforded by  its development.    282.   It  must  be pointed out that the so-called super (coal-fired)power stations now under construction will in time gradually supersedethe older  types of power station, and these  will certainly be able to generate electricity at a cost  which will not exceed 0-8d. per unit at a34 per cent,  annual load factor.   The effect of these  stations upon thecost of production  cannot fail to be manifest twenty years  hence.There will always be, however,  a number  of  power stations  whichmust  of necessity operate at  a very low annual load factor in order tomeet  the peak loads of the national load diagram.  It is usual to placethese stations  as near as possible  to the loads  which  they   serve.Nevertheless, the  barrage system, with  a  secondary storage  equip-ment, would be able economically to  take the place of those low load-factor coal-fired stations,  with  a marked reduction  in  comparativecosts.   Even a modern  power  station, if  restricted to peak loadpurposes,  and  working (say) at  a low annual  load  factor of 10 percent.,  cannot generate  electricity at  less than 0&apos;962d. per unit, and sometimes a  good deal more. The barrage plant,  on the  other  hand,could be so utilised that, while a part of its output would be delivereddirect to  the  grid  from  the primary plant  at  the barrage,  theremainder of the available energy could be regulated from day  to dayso as  to replace the more  expensive low load-factor coal-fired stations,with a more  pronounced saving in annual costs than the figures citedabove  suggest.
Til    288.   The  original load curves,  as shown in the  appendix on-diagram  no.  6, and the corresponding figures for output were basedon the assumption that the whole of the output at the barrage (bothprimary  and secondary)  would be utilised in  supplying  a demandhaving a load  factor of approximately 84  per cent.   On making an analysis  of the tidal and electrical load,  we find that it  would bepossible  to use some  of  the  output both  from  the primary  andthe secondary  installations at different load factors.   The resultantcomposite load  curve shows that the scheme will give                                                    Million units                                                    per annum.    An amount of energy  at 84 per  cent, load factor      from the primary installation direct into mains  = 420    An amount of energy  at 10 per cent,  load factor      from the primary installation direct into mains  = 284    An amount of energy  at 84 per cent,  load factor      from the secondary system direct  into mains  = 310    An amount  of energy at 15-25 per cent, load factor      from the secondary system direct  into mains  = 596                    Total output......    ...   1,610    The difference between the 1,610 million units shown  above andthe 1,643 million units  given  in paragraph 272 above is due to thefrictional loss of head in the necessary pipe-lines between the reservoirand the pumping station.    284.   From the above  figures  it will  be seen that it  would bepossible to deliver approximately 704 million units per annum direct from the primary plant at the barrage and 906 million units from the secondary storage  station.   Part of the output  from both  stations would be delivered to the line at the normal load factor of 84 per cent.and the remainder, representing approximately nine-sixteenths of thetotal output, would be utilised for peak  load purposes at a load factorvarying from 15 down to 10 per cent, and would thus take the placeof units from coal-fired stations, which cost much more to produce.    285.   The comparative costs may now be stated as follows  :-     Cost of output from coal-fired plant:                      .  730 million units at. 84 per cent,  load factor  x 03d.     =   918,500 596 million units at 15-25 per cent, load  factor x0-679d. = 1,686,000 284 million units at 10 per cent,  load factor  x 0&apos;962d.    = 1,138,500             Total   ............     ... = 3,787,000Cost of output from the barrage, primary and secondary stations :-                      *                                Barraye power station (see paragraph 260)  ...    1,628,869 Reservoir and storage, station,  including cost of   extra transmission lines (see paragraph 280)      827,416                                                    2,451,285    286.  Thus  there will be  an annual  saving of  1,285,715  in favour of the tidal power scheme, as compared with coal-fired stations.    287.  Thus the cost of constructing the power scheme would be : -         &apos;       ......      &apos;.     ^  &apos;          .

After allowing 4% compound interest during construction, the  (Omplote  power scheme  could thus be  carried  out at a  costof  about  38.500.000.  exclusive  of   about   12,000,000  allocated
to new road, railway, and harbour  facilities.  As shown above (para-graph 285), the resulting output of electrical energy could be produced at a cost which would show  a  positive  saving on  the equivalent costfrom coal-fired stations.  On  these grounds there is, therefore, a case for constructing these works.   289.  We have not been able to investigate in detail the secondarystorage  scheme.  We can say, however, at this stage,  that  there appears to be a practicable and  economic method of smoothing out thetidal irregularities and of making the supply from  the barrage flexible and of economic value to the  general  electrical requirements of thecountry.  If it is considered that a priina facie case has been made,then it will be necessary to survey the proposed upland reservoir site,the route of the proposed pressure tunnel, to investigate the tidal reach of the Wye, and particularly  to consider the problem arising from thesilt in  the  Severn  estuary.   For  instance,  the maximum  rate ofpumping to the reservoir is  estimated  to  be  12,000 cusecs, and the weight of water raised 2,6(50 million tons per annum.   290.  Assuming  the water  pumped to the reservoir  to  contain1 part in 1,200 by weight of  silt, some  2 2 million tons of silt will becarried into the reservoir each year.  A proportion of the silt broughtinto the reservoir during a given pumping period would be returnedto the river during the immediately succeeding period of operation ofthe secondary  turbines, but provision  would need  to  be made for removing the remainder.   291.  The  consulting engineers, however,  have expressed  theopinion that it would be quite practicable and  would  not involve  muchannual expense to remove this silt by dredging and discharging it near the intake of the turbines, thus returning it to the Wye through theturbines during their working  period.   As the silt is in a colloidalstate it would not be likely, even under the  large head available atthe turbines, to cause damage  to them by attrition.   292.  This problem would  require to be carefully  investigated.since the scour from the tail race of the turbines would have only alimited range and the silt might still be deposited in the form of a barlower down  the river and would add to the cost of  dredging inside the barrage itself.   293.  We have already said that once expenditure on a secondaryreservoir had been incurred  it  would almost  certainly be  possible intime for the Central  Electricity7 Board to make an even better relativeuse of the supply by arranging for the barrage scheme to take the placeof the less  economic coal-fired stations,  which are at present retainedonly for the  purpose of meeting  the  peaks in  the electrical  loaddiagram.   294.  The complete the  investigation, the following work wouldbe necessary :    (1)  The river Wye  would require  to be  investigated in order to          ascertain what the  effect of pumping so much water into the          high-level  reservoir  would be  upon the  amenities of the          river  and  the  fisheries   interests.   This would  involve          additional tests on the model, extended to cover the  Wye.   (2)  More detailed consideration  would be necessary regarding the          deposition of silt from the tail races of the secondary turbine          plant.                     *   (3)  A  further examination would  be  needed  of the proposed          upland reservoir site. It would be necessary also to fix the          site for the secondary hydro-electric and pumping plant on          the banks  of the Wye ; and to make a survey of the routes          for the pipe-lines,  and   a  valuation  of  the  land to  be          acquired for the above purposes.   (4)  Finally,  drawings and  detailed  estimates for the  secondary          scheme would require to be prepared.
        X SUMMARY  OF  PRINCIPAL  CONCLUSIONS.    293.  We  submit   the   following  summary   of   our   principal conclusions:    (1) The most stiitablc site for a barrage from the geological point                              of view.    A further examination has been made of the geological character- istics of the  various possible sites for  a barrage  across the Severn. This fully supports the conclusion previously reached  that  from  the geological standpoint  the  most suitable site  would  be across  the English Stones on a line approximately  parallel to  the existing Severn Tunnel (paragraphs 49-70).      (2) The effect of a barrage on tidal levels, navigation, (be.    The effect of a barrage on tidal levels, navigation, &amp;c, has been the subject of a further series of experiments on the Severn tidal model, as the result of which the  following conclusions emerge :-    (a)  A barrage  would not injuriously affect navigation below  the          barrage;    (b) Even  without dredging,  a barrage  would not seriously affect          navigation  above  the  barrage at any   time,  and  would          appreciably improve it at low  water, while with a compara-          tively small amount of dredging it would be at least as good          at high tides  and very considerably better at all other times;    (c)  A barrage would provide the means of reducing inundation in          the  upper estuary in times of flood in the Severn (paragraphs          71-131). (8) Estiniate  of the electrical energy that would be available from A                              barrage.   The  potential  output of  electrical  energy  obtainable under  the scheme has been calculated after allowance  has been made  for losses due   to  flow  over  the  English  Stones  and   on  the  following assumptions:     (a)  that 67 turbines of the approved type would  always be available          for use;    (b)  that the maximum output per turbine at spring tides will not          exceed approximately 17,000 brake-horse-power;   (c)  that the English Stones would be excavated to-8 feet O.D.;   (d)  that the high-water level in the  basin at Beachley is 4- 23 feet          O.D. at  spring tides,  + 18 feet  O.D. at mean tides,  and          4-12-5 feet O.D. at neap tides.   On the fore-going assumptions, the output per tide in Board  of Trade units would be as follows:           Spring tides...........    4,680,000          Mean tides............    3,190,000          Neap tides............    1,300,000   As there are 706 tides per annum, the total  potential output fromthe generators amounts  to 2,252 million  units per annum (paragraphs132-1M).(4) Civil engineering  works and  mechanical  and electrical equipment                      that would be required.   Detailed designs for the civil engineering  works  that  would  berequired, together with  a programme  for the exeoutlon of the worksever  a  period of  15  years,  have  been  prepared by the consulting engineers, Messrs.  Coode,  Wilson, Mitchell, and vaughan-Lee.   Inthe preparation of their  scheme, they were guided by the consideration that  it was essential that the  barrage should be  of such  a design thatIt  would    (a) enable the  maximum output  of electricity to  be generated         consistent with the  economic  construction  of  the requisite         sluice and turbine dams, &amp;o.;    [7972]                                                  M
    (b)  satisfy navigation requirements, i.c, that it would include the          necessary looks, guide piers, &amp;c.;    (c) provide for rail and road  cross-river traffic, i.e.,  that it would          include viaduots, rolling lift bridges, &amp;o.    Subject  to  fuller investigation  of certain points of  detail, theconsulting engineers are of the opinion  that it  would be possible to overcome the technical  difficulties involved in the  construction of theworks,  including the blocking of  the Shoots and  the constructionthereon of the embankment dam (paragraphs 145-227).   The mechanical and  electrical equipment that  would be requiredhave been investigated and a satisfactory scheme drawn up (paragraphs228-246).           (5;  Estimate of the cost of the barrage works.   The following is an estimate of the cost of the  several portions ofthe proposed works and equipment, to which is attached an allocation of these costs as between     (a) the electrical power scheme;    (b) the roadways authorities;    (c) the Great Western Railway  Company;    (d) the authority responsible for the operation of the locks and          the regulation of the  impounding basin.Suggested allocation of cost.1 i Total cost Section of work. of works.

The cost  of production  of  electricity  at  the barrage  has been estimated on the following assumptions:    (a) that the works  might begin in five years&apos; time, allowing for         preliminary negotiations and the promotion of a Government         Hybrid Bill, i.c, in 1937;   (b) that a period of 15 years would be required for completion and         before energy could be delivered to the national &quot; grid &quot;;   (o) that the average rate of interest would not exceed 4 per cent.,         on  the presumption that a  government  guarantee  would         have to be given to  works  of such magnitude and novelty;   (d) that  the loan  repayment  period  for  the  permanent civil         engineering  structures  would  be   75 years,  for  heavy         structural  steel and the massive  turbines and other  heavy         machinery (the moving and wearable  parts being dealt with         out  of revenue), 30 years, and for eleotrloal machinery and         apparatus, 20 years;   (e) that the annual output from  the barrage would be 2,252 million         units, and that of these, 45 million units (i,c, 2  per  cent.)         would be  required for operating the sluices, starting up the         turbine sets, operating cranes, travelling workshops,  &amp;c.;
     (f) that it would be necessary to add to the estimated cost of the          power scheme  ( 20,334,000)  a sum of  5,123,300, being          capitalised interest at 4 per cent, during construction;     (g) that the expenditure on the construction of the power scheme          would be spread  over a period of IS years, and would be          distributed  over each of these years at  rates calculated in          accordance with normal engineering experience;     (h) that  appropriate  allowance is  made for the annual  cost of          repairs and maintenance of the works and plant, for dredging          and for management and operation.    On the  fore-going assumptions and  if  the  estimated output of 2,252 million units was obtained, the  output for  revenue-earning purposes (i.e.,  after the deduction of 2 per cent, of the total output for internal use in  operating the sluices, &amp;c.)  would be 2,207 million units, and  -the average cost per unit sent  out to transmission lines would be 0-1765(7.   On the expiration of 75 years (i.c, when the debt charges had been paid off and on the assumption that the works would be  in workable condition for  many  decades thereafter), this figure would be reduced to 0 106(/.    Owing to  the intermittent output of the energy derivable from  the barrage, if  not  combined with some storage  scheme,  no saving in  the amount  of  steam plant  installed at other  power  stations would be possible.  The comparison of the intermittent supply from the barrage with a supply from  a coal-fired station should properly be based on  the saying of coal  and  that  alone.   On the fore-going basis  it is clear, therefore, that unless suitable means  can  be  devised  by which a secondary storage  system may be  added so  as  to  smooth out  the irregularity  of  the  tidal  power, the barrage  scheme would  not be economically  practicable (paragraphs 253-265). (7)  Estimate of the cost  of constructing  a  secondary storage  system                 and of the electricity so generated.    Storage  could be  provided  by the  construction of  a high-level reservoir  at Trelleck Grange to which the barrage  could pump water during the  operation of the tidal turbines.   The high-level water so obtained  would, in turn,  drive a set of  secondary hydro-electric plant and thus provide a 24-hour supply of electricity.  The total energy that could be  stored  in a reservoir on this  site  would be  26,910,000 h.p. hours (paragraphs 266-269).    With  a  load factor of 34 per cent.,  845 million units would be available  from  the  reservoir  station.   This, with 798  million units which would be available to be taken direct from the primary plant at the barrage, represents a total output of 1,643 million units per annum (i.c, 74-5  per  cent, of the total energy generated at the barrage). Frictional loss of head in the pipe lines  between the reservoir and the pumping station would reduce the 1,643 million units to 1,610 million units (paragraphs 270-272 and 283).    Owing to this reduction in output, the primary cost at the barrage would be  increased from  0-1765*7. to  0-2372(7.  per  unit  (para- graph 273.)    The estimated cost of generating electricity at coal-fired stations at a 34 per cent, load-factor is equivalent to 0-375(7. per unit delivered to transmission lines.   The difference between this figure and the cost of electricity generated at the barrage is 0 1378(7. per unit in favour of the barrage soheme  (paragraphs 274, 275).    On the assumption that the ratio of annual costs  to capital expendi- ture would be the same for the secondary (reservoir) installation as for the  primary (barrage)  installation, a sum of   14,800,000 would  be available  for  expenditure  on the  secondary  station before the total annual cost (including capital charges) would exceed that of the coal- fired station producing the same output of elecirlcity at the same load- factor (paragraph 277).    The estimated cost of  the secondary  station,  including oapitalised Interest, is about  11,469,000.    To this figure it  would be necessary to add  1,500,000,  being  theestimated additional expenditure that would  require to be incurred bythe Central Electricity Board on account of the adoption of the barragescheme (paragraph 279).
   Thus, the total extra cost of providing the reservoir, the secondarystorage station, and the transmission system  would be approximately 13,000,000 (paragraph 280).   On the information available, it appears, therefore,  that the cost of constructing the complete power scheme  (i.c, that of the works at the barrage and those required for the secondary station)  would be about 38,500,000, exclusive of a sum of about  12,000,000 allocated to road,railway, and harbour interests (paragraphs 287, 288).   With such an  expenditure, the resulting output of electrical energycould be produced at a cost which would show a positive saving on the equivalent cost from  coal-fired stations.   On these grounds there is,therefore, a case for constructing the Severn barrage (paragraph 288).   Once expenditure  on a secondary reservoir had  been  incurred, itwould be possible in time for the Central Electricity  Board to  make an even better relative use of the supply by arranging  for the barragescheme to take the place of the less economic coal-fired stations, whichare at present retained only for the purpose of meeting the peaks in the electrical load (paragraph 282).   The following  work would  be necessary to complete the investiga-tions in regard to the secondary storage scheme:    (a)  The river Wye  would require  to be investigated  in order to         ascertain what the effect of pumping so much water into the         high-level reservoir would be upon the amenities of the river         and the fisheries interests.   This would  involve  additional         tests on the model,  extended to cover the Wye;   (b)  More detailed consideration  would be  necessary regarding the         deposition of silt from the  tail races of the secondary turbine         plant;   (c) A further examination would be needed of the proposed upland         reservoir site.  It would be  necessary also to fix the site for         the secondary hydro-electric and pumping plant on the banks         of the Wye; and to make a survey of the routes for the pipe-         lines, and a valuation of the land to be acquired for the above         purposes;   (d) Finally, drawings and detailed  estimates for the  secondary         scheme  would require to be prepared (paragraphs 289-294).
