IllPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1933.SECRET.                                                Copy No.  4.1CP.  48  (33).CABINET.EXPORT  OF ARMS  TO THE FAR EAST.    THE Prime Minister has directed that there should be a special Cabinet onMonday to consider this subject further.  I regret very much to be so troublesomebut, on further reflection, I doubt whether the decision at which we arrived onWednesday should stand.  That decision involved announcing in the Debate onMonday that we had decided to suspend the issue of licences for export of armsand ammunition  to China and Japan for, say, a fortnight, in respect of new contracts.  Admittedly every course is open to grave  difficulties, but this courseseems to me, on reflection, to have no advantages, for the following reasons :     (a) A  fortnight is so short a time that  it is quite impossible to regard it           as sufficient to allow an international agreement to be reached.  In           particular, the United States could not be  counted upon to reach any           decision whatever on such a subject in the next fortnight.  What then           is the fortnight limit intended to provide for?   We cannot in any           event count upon Russian co-operation.    (b) If a fortnight is to give time for enquiries  addressed to other States,           we shall only get temporising answers and at the end of the fortnight,           optimists will exert redoubled pressure to continue the period longer.           The prospect  that we may be forced to do  so is likely to induce other           nations deliberately to delay discussion, so that in the meantime they           may get the orders which our armament firms will lose.    (c) On the other hand, a fortnights interval is absolutely no use for the           purpose of checking export.  It only applies to new contracts  and a           new contract of any size will not be ready for actual export through           the customs for a fortnight.  So nothing whatever will happen as the           result of our announcement.  We shall be challenged as to how much           good our fortnights suspension has done and the whole thing will           be denounced  as a piece of hypocrisy.    (d) But the announcement of the fortnights suspension will  be exploited           by  rival manufacturers abroad as a means for  diverting orders to           themselves.    (e) There would be  something to be said for declaring that we would not           be responsible for contributing to a prolongation of fighting whatever           other people  did, and I am myself quite  prepared to consider this           course. But if we do, there is no sense in talking about a fortnight.    I have dictated, very roughly, the heads of a possible line of statement whichavoids the announcement of a  decision to  suspend for  a fortnight, and this is circulated to indicate the general line.  The language  is not  intended to be final,but the paper will make plain the sort of statement I had in mind.                                                                    J. S.    February 24, 1933.[8268]
                     Propositions for Monday&apos;s Debate.    1.  The Assembly of the League has adopted unanimously the draft reportof the Committee of Nineteen.   To the framing of that  report this country hasmade its full contribution.  Our own policy in this matter has been consistentthroughout.  The critics who,  some months ago, were denouncing  us for asupposed unwillingness to adopt the Lytton Report were completely misled;  we made it clear throughout that, if conciliation failed, there was no view of  the far eastern crisis which could be substituted for the view of  the Lytton Report, andwe have been as good as our word.    2.  Whatever may be said for the special needs or circumstances of Japan in manchuria, there can be no doubt at all that her methods are not the methods ofthe League and are  rightly declared by the League to be unjustified.  There ismuch in the past  conduct of China which is open to criticism, but, on the actualissue  involved in  the Report, we have never hesitated to  make our own positionperfectly plain.  And now that Japan rejects the Report and the decision of  theLeague, it is manifest that, however much we regret Japan&apos;s action, and however much we recognise the strong points in her case, we must  associate ourselves withthe League view.    3.  In these circumstances it is perfectly natural that a demand should arisefor action which  would prevent the sustaining of the conflict by the supply ofarms.  The Government  recognise the moral force that lies  behind that  appeal.It would be a great satisfaction to many of us, especially in view of the sincereefforts we are making to promote disarmament and to establish the reign of peace,to be  able to feel that our own country had nothing to do with supplying to  theFar East the means  of fighting  and, it may be, of prolonging the contest.  Thesentiment is a deep and sincere  one and  we have examined the situation in fullsympathy with  that sentiment.  It is a horrible thing, in  the view of many of us,that profit should be made by the supply of the means of promoting fighting whichis neither necessary nor just.    4.  A  little reflection leads  inevitably to the conclusion that, if this  kind of thing is to be effectively stopped, it can only be stopped  by  international agree-ment  and, what is more, by strict compliance by every nation with the agreement it signs.  President Hoover the other day in a message to Congress described  the effort of a single nation to stop arms traffic as a &quot; futility.&apos;&apos;  We ourselves havea system of control,  so far as the export of arms and ammunition is concerned,which, unfortunately, has no parallel in most foreign countries that manufacture and sell arms.  The  United States is in  a still more helpless position, for (as Iwas informed when the British Government  took the initiative in trying to bringabout an international arrangement to  supply no arms for the war betweenBolivia and Paraguay) the President is at present empowered by Congress onlyto stop the  export of war material to any American country or any country wherethe United States  exercises territorial  jurisdiction  &quot; in which  conditions of domestic violence  exist.&quot;  It was after I had made this proposal for joint inter-national action that President Hoover addressed the message to Congress, asking for the necessary powers &quot; to limit or  forbid shipments of  arms for military purposes.&quot;  These  powers  have not yet been  conferred upon the  President,although a joint  resolution with this purpose in  view is now before  Congress.There seems to  be a possibility that these powers, if conferred, may be limited toLatin American countries.  Experience in the case of the embargo on arms to china some  years  ago shows  that, even with an  agreement  between several countries, the  arms  traffic was limited  but not stopped, though we compliedstrictly with our own promise. There is, unfortunately, no doubt, therefore, aboutthe proposition that  the only effective form of action would be international, andthis is recognised in  responsible League of Nations circles.    5.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious that the above proposition shouldnot lead to unnecessary delay.  We have in fact already communicated with someof the principal arms-producing countries of the world in order to ascertain theirviews as to what is possible.   This  is  not  done with  any desire to sidetrackGeneva, for it will be no doubt at Geneva that the matter must be handled, but itis done to save  time so far as we are able to  save it.
    6.  While it must be admitted that international action is the only form of effective action,  we have by no means overlooked  the  question whether, as  an interim proceeding or as a matter of example, this country could by itself take anystep.   Our conclusion  is that, apart from any other  difficulties, it would  beimpossible  for  this country  acting  alone  to differentiate between  the parties.Questions of that sort can only be prudently handled by international agreement.We are not called upon to involve ourselves by individual action in the difficultieswhich might well arise if a British ship is authorised to carry arms to x but notto y, and we have no intention of putting ourselves in that position.   If, therefore,individual  action  was contemplated by ourselves, it would have  to  apply  to both x and  y.    7.  As to this, another difficulty arises which  must be stated quite franklyin the House.  Japan has very extensive  munitions  factories and is a highly-organised industrial State :  for the purposes of her army she is probably  more concerned to secure supplies of materials,  like copper and other metals, than to getfinished munitions.   Our Act of Parliament only enables us to control arms andammunition.    For example, when certain merchant ships were sold to Japanrecently, there was no power by British law to stop  the sale.  On the other hand.China&apos;s need in  the conflict is  for arms and ammunition, and probably half the purchases in this country have been on China&apos;s account.  We are seriously con-cerned lest  it should be said that the complete stopping for  a time of export to either China or  Japan is really a further  handicap against  China.   I can evenimagine some malicious person suggesting that it is a crafty invention to assistJapan.    8.  Our  conclusion,  therefore, is that  the whole question  involves thepromptest consideration  internationally.   We have done what we could to hurrythings up.  There is always a temptation to let one&apos;s moral feelings be an excuse for refusing to think things out.  It is absolutely necessary that the House shouldface the real complications.  I point them out. not in  any desire to belittle the moral issue or in any desire to create obstruction, but because past experience hasshown how difficult it is to do anything effective.  (The Geneva Arms convention of 1927 has to this  hour not been ratified.)   Consequently, we must  state theactual difficulties plainly to the House,  and ask in the debate how our criticsthink that those difficulties can be overcome.    [9.  Under Article  16  the United Kingdom must  be the judge of what  itsown course should be.   We desire to make it entirety plain that in this matterwe could not act at the dictation of  others or regard ourselves as involved in the enforcement of sanctions, because the vote of  the majority of other States whohave no practical responsibility in Far Eastern waters called for it.  We shoulddeprecate pronouncing Yes or  No as to any Article of  the Covenant, but,  if the critics insist upon asking the question,  the answer should be quite plainly No.]    February 24, 1933.
