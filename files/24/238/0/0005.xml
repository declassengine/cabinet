PAYMENT OP ROYALTIES ON OIL PRODUCED                               IN GREAT&quot; BRITAIN.                 Note by the President of the Board of Trade.                I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues  a           memorandum by the Secretary for Mines regarding a difficulty           which has arisen in connection with the issue of licences           under the Petroleum Production Act, 1918.                Mr.  Shinwell, when Secretary for Mines, decided  to           include in a licence which he issued in July, 1931, a           condition that royalties should not be paid, except with the           approval of the Secretary for Mines, on any oil which might           be produced.  After the issue of the licence he intended to           submit to the Government the whole question of the issue of           these licences.   The Labour Government, however, resigned           before this submission was made.                The change made by Mr. Shinwell represented a reversal           of a policy adopted after full consideration of the position           by the Government in 1922.  The condition imposed by           Mr. Shinwell obviously gives rise to considerable difficulties           both to the applicants for licences and to the Department  in           administration.  Whatever its intention, it was, in effect,           an attempt to prevent or control royalty payments on  petroleum           products while leaving mineral rights in private ownership.           It cannot do this in practice but it would force the           applicant, in. order to secure facilities he requires, to           make arrangements with the mineral owner,  alternative to a           tonnage royalty, such as a bigger rental or shares in the           company, which may be unduly onerous, and the Department has           then to make up its. mind whether it can endorse the arrange-           ment made,  Such a state of affairs must hamper the  search           for oil, and this is (Undesirable in the national interest.
Moreover, a case already exists in which the Governmentendorsed the payment of royalties, so that the maintenanceof the condition  does nothing to avoid the creation of a precedent.      Pour applications for licences have &quot;been received during the past few months, hut have been held up pending a decision on the question at issue, and I shall he glad tohave authority for- the proposal made in paragraph 21 of thememorandum, vis: to issue licences to search for and producepetroleum without any stipulation about payment of royaltieson the understanding that the Secretary for Mines will raisethe matter again should further discoveries of oil insubstantial quantities be made, or should legislationdealing with coal mining royalties he undertaken.Board of Trade,   16th February, 1933.
                      PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES                               ON                 OIL PRODUCED IN GREAT BRITAIN.             Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.   1.  Under the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1918, searching or&quot;boring for oil in Great Britain was prohibited except under licence issued by the Minister of Munitions.   These powers arenow exercised by the Board of Trade through the Secretary for mines.   Since the Act was passed only eight licences have beengranted, four of which have been issued since the Board of Tradebecame responsible for the administration of the Act.   The. lastwas issued by Mr. Shinwell as Secretary for Mines on the20th July, 1931,  to the N.M.D. Syndicate.   In considering theapplication for that licence, Mr. Shinwell took the view that provision should if possible be made to avoid the payment ofroyalties on any oil which might be got.    He intended to raisethe matter with the Government before issuing any furtherlicences,  but as the N.M.D.  Syndicate had already been promiseda licence, and were anxious  to get to y/ork,  Mr.  Shinwell decidedthat as some of the earlier  licences had contained a clauserequiring that no royalties  should be paid (the circumstances in which such a provision was inserted are referred to inparagraphs 9 and 10),  he would issue the  licence to theSyndicate on the understanding that a similar clause would beincluded,  and take up the question with the Government after-wards.   Shortly after the issue of the licence the labour government resigned.   The terms of the clause referred to were as follows:        &quot;2.  The Licensee shall not at any time without the     consent in writing of the Secretary  for Mines either     directly or indirectly make or procure to be made to     or for the benefit of any person having any estate or     interest in any land within the Licensed Area from     which petroleum shall be gotten any payments by way     of royalty commission profit or otherwise in respect     of such petroleum or any part thereof.&quot;
   2.  The N.M.D. Syndicate accepted the condition under protestand as soon as the Labour Government resigned they asked forreconsideration of the provision.   Under their licence theyhave carried out drilling and after abandoning one borehole ata depth of a few hundred feet owing to drilling trouble theyhave now reached a depth of 1,341 feet in a second borehole.As they consider that there is a possibility that they maydiscover oil at about 2,000 feet, they have again pressed forthe withdrawal of the condition on the ground that as long assuch a condition remains they will find it very difficult toextend their operations, and that the maintenance of such acondition will definitely hamper the search for oil in thiscountry.   3.  Even if the case of the N.K.D. Syndicate were the onlyone&apos;to be considered at the moment the position would be unsatisfactory.   In order to give them some margin ofprotection against competitors who,  in the event of the Syndicatefinding oil,  might have drilled all round the plot of land onwhich they have the right of entry for drilling purposes,  theSecretary for Mines granted them a licence over an area of four square miles.   At present they only have the right of entry over about one and a half square miles and if the termsof the licence are maintained it is difficult to see how,  withnothing to offer the landowners concerned,  they could everobtain access to the remainder of the area included in thelicence.   4.  The need for reconsideration of the procedure adopted byMr. Shinwell is further strengthened by the fact that withinthe last few months four other applications for licences havebeen received,  but no action on them has been taken pending adecision on the question at issue.    It is felt that the matterought not to be deferred any longer and that a decision should
oe taken on the policy to be pursued in connection with the applications now pending and any others which may be received.   5.  In the view of the Secretary for Mines,  the arrangement made in connection with the licence granted to the N.M.D.Syndicate is not satisfactory either to the Department or  to  thelicensees.   It places on the Department the onus of deciding whether or not any payment should be allowed;  and unless  paymentis to be refused in every case very great difficulties are likelyto arise in deciding in which cases payment should be made andthe rate of payment.   Prom the point of view of the licenseesthe clause gives rise to uncertainty and will make it verydifficult, if not impossible, for arrangements to be made  with land and mineral owners.   6.  Por a proper appreciation of the position it is necessaryto give a short history of petroleum legislation in this country,which commenced during the War, when the question of obtaininghome supplies of oil became of great importance.   In 1917 anattempt was made by the Coalition Government to pass a fairlycomprehensive measure to deal with the production of oil inthis country including the question of royalties-    The bill was,  however, defeated.   7.  In -introducing that Bill - the Petroleum (Production)Bill, 1917 - Mr. Walter Long said:         &quot;The objects of the Bill are very simple.   We     place in the hands of the Government all rights to get     petroleum, and in this way enable the Government to     lease defined petroliferous areas, and thus prevent waste     and loss of time.   We provide for the payment for oil     won within a defined petroliferous zone or pool to the     various surface owners within the zone by way of a fixed     royalty.   We provide for the getting of oil by persons     or companies on terms and conditions to be fixed by the     Board of Trade, and we set up all the necessary machinery     for this purpose.   Any work done during the War can  be     done under the Defence of the Realm Act, but after the     War the acquisition of surface upon which to drill or     erect works can be done  under these provisions,  or by     private Bill, or by Provisional Order.   The Bill is  a     very short one.   The first Clause provides for vesting     in His Majesty the right to bore;  secondly,  for the
     payment and distribution of royalties;  and thirdly,     for schemes.   A Petroleum Royalty Fund is set up out     of which to pay certain expenses and to meet the     demands of the different royalty ov/ners, as to which     there may be some difficulty in allocation at the     moment,   While the Board of Trade will prepare the     schemes and do the greater part of the work, the     Railway and Canal Commissioners are empowered to     decide certain questions on hearing evidence which     they are given cower to hear.1^  (Official Report,     15th August, 1917, Volume 97 /1188/-)     In his remarks on the second Reading, Mr. Long said:         &quot;It is desirable to proceed with it as rapidly as     possible, because, as I told the House on the intro-     duction, the experience of other countries tells us     that once the idea gets abroad that there is anything     like petroleum to be found, the spirit of enterprise     and competition and speculation is aroused.   Immense     sums have been spent in other countries in searching     for oil, in cases in which the money has really been     wasted.   Our object is to prevent anything of the     kind.   Our object is to secure this concession for     the Crown and for the  Country and to secure it     expeditiously ana economically.   I believe that this     Bill would secure these ends.&quot; . . (Official Report,     16th October, 1917, Volume 98 /J5Q/) .   8.  The main point on which discussion centred in the debate on the Bill was the provision which dealt with royalties underwhich it was claimed a vested interest would be set up in amineral not hitherto produced in this country and the existenceof which had .not even been proved.   It was on this issue thatthe Government was defeated on the Committee Stage of the MoneyResolution, and after some delay the Government decided not toproceed with the Bill.   9.  At that time there was an acute shortage of oil and theGovernment were considering an offer made by Messrs. S. Pearsonand Son, to carry out experimental drilling.   Ultimately.anagreement was made with the Company under which the Governmentwere to finance the drilling operations up to a sum of 1,000,000.   Actually rather more than half this sumwas spent.   Powers were available to the Government duringthe period of the War under Regulations made under theDefence of the Realm Act to protect the activities of theGovernment&apos;s Agents, and to secure right of entry on to land.
 The Government decided, however, that while it might not be possible  to secure  the pessing by Parliament of the larger measure,  it was desirable to have a permanent statute which would et  least prevent indiscriminate drilling, and accordingly the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1918, was passed as a piece of step-gap legislation.   The Act prohibited the drilling for petroleum except under Licence,,   The question of Royalties was not dealt with;  it was reserved.for settlement after the War.   A pledge was given by Sir Laming worthington Evans on behalf of the Government during the passage of the Bill that they would not either directly or indirectly pay royalties under the Bill.   (Official Report, 5th August, 1918, Volume 109, Col.1082).   10. Under the terms of their agreement with the Government Messrs. Pearson had commenced drilling operations in several areas which were considered most likely to produce oil.   Only in one case, however, was oil found in workable quantities, viz., at the Hardstoft well in Derbyshire on land owned by the Duke of Devonshire.   Towards the end of 1920 this well had been producing about one ton of oil per day for nearly 20 months. It was then necessary to sell a quantity of it, as the storage tank was nearly full and deterioration was likely to occur. The Duke of Devonshire claimed the proceeds of the sale of the oil and commenced a legal action against the Government through the Director of the Petroleum Department and Messrs.  Pearson to enforce the claim.   It would no doubt have been possible to settle the claim, but it was impossible to negotiate owing to the pledge given by the Government during the passage of the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1918, and to statements made in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister in 1919 and 1920 to the effect that no royalties would be payable on petroleumwon in this country.    (During this period three licences
                                                           72were issued which contained a clause giving effect to theGovernments decision, and it was this precedent on which mr. Shinwell relied in the case of the licence granted tothe N.M.D. Syndicate).    11. The Government were thus faced with the position of deciding either (i) that the development of oil in this country should be dealt with on the same basis as other minerals;or (ii) that legislation somewhat on the lines of thatintroduced in 1917 should he again brought &quot;before Parliament.The matter was under consideration for about a year, duringwhich period another Bill was prepared, but was neverintroduced to Parliament, and the terms on which the Duke of devonshire would be prepared to settle his claim wereascertained privately.   Those terms were briefly that the duke would forego his claim to the oil already won and wouldtake over the plant on the site at a valuation on condition that his right to the remainder of the oil produced was definitely recognised, and that he or his nominee was given a licence to work the area without condition as to royaltypayments.   Settlement on such terms involved the reversal of the policy cf the Government as indicated above.    TheGovernment ultimately decided in February, 1922, to reverseits policy :&apos;and settle with the Duke,    It justified its actionon the ground that as a result of the work carried out by messrs. Pearson it appeared that oil production in the UnitedKingdom was not likely to assume large dimensions.   12. The Secretary for Mines (Mr. Bridgeman) announced thedecision of the Government in the House of Commons on 6th March, 1922.   He said that the Government had abandonedtheir intention of introducing legislation to give the Crownany further rights or powers in respect of petroleum thanit already possessed under the Petroleum (production) Act, 1918,
 and that In exercising their powers under that Act, the Government would not  interfere with the rights of private individuals further than might be necessary to prevent indiscriminate  or  improper  borings    (official Report, 6th march, 1922,   Volume 151, Col,. 831. )   13o  The claim  of  the Duke was finally settled in March 192?s A  lioence to work  the well was granted to him and Hardatoft has continued to yield oil  in small quantities up to the pre sen- times   The Duke does not himself carry on any operations but has leased the  borehole and he receives royalties on the oil produced a   14.  However desirable, therefore, it may be to preventy in regard to oil production in the country, a system of royalties 3uch  as  that which has grown up in oonnection with other minerals, the question of not allowing such a system to start has already  been settled by the decision of the Government taken in 1922o   15*  There are  now three alternatives before the Government: (i) to adhere to the  decision taken by Mro Shinwell that licences shall  contain a provision similar to that included in the licence  granted to the NsMoD* Syndicate;  (ii) to revert to the position which obtained between 1922 and 1951; or (iii) to introduce legislation which would deal more comprehensively with  petroleum development than the Petroleum (Production) Act,  1918, including some definite provision in regard to royalties*   16*  As regards (i) it ha3 already been indicated that in theview of the Secretary for Mine3 this arrangement isunoatisfactory*  When the provision was included in the earlier licences it could  bo  justified on the ground that it was inserted beoause the Government policy had not been determinedand it was considered desirable to prevent the creation of apreoedent for the recognition of  the private ownership of oil                          -7-
 while that policy was under  consideration.  Further, while the Defence of the Realm Act remained in force the Government oould put the licensee in possession without having to put upon him the necessity for making terms v/ith owners of mineral rights,   17*  The decision of the  Government in 1S22 set up a new state of affairs when the claim of  the Duke of Devonshire to the oil taken from his land  and to  charge royalties was conceded^   18o  The maintenance of the condition inserted in the licence granted to the HeMoD. Syndicate and its insertion in future licences is likely to hamper the search for oil and this ia undesirable in the national  interest.   19o  As regards alternative (ii) it is the present view of the Secretary for Mines that the powers existing under the Petroleum (Production) Aot9  1913, give the Government all that is necessary at the moment to regulate in an orderly manner the search for oilo  Until oil is discovered in substantial quantities, or possibly until some  of the larger oil companies indicate a desire again to explore  seriously the possibilities of finding oil in this country, there would appear to be no real case for&quot; broadening the basis of petroleum legislationo  In any case, the royalties question can only become an important practical issue when one of  these eventualities materialises.   20.  The comments on alternative (ii) practically dispose for the time being of alternative (iii)o  There is little doubt that a new Petroleum B ill would be regarded as a controversialmeasure and as tlie natter is not one of Immediate practical importance,  it would be unwise to raise the issue at a timewhen more urgent and weighty problems demand the attention ofthe Government.   21.   It is desirable,  however,  that no imdue obstaoles should be placed by the Government in the way of bong fide  efforts to search for oil and it  is therefore  suggested that the
Secretary for Mines should be authorised to adopt alternative(ii), which will restore the position whioh obtained before theissue of the licence to the N*M3D. Syndioate, on theunderstanding that the Seoretary for Mines will raise thenatter again should further discoveries of oil in substantial quantities be made, or should legislation dealing with coalmining royalties be undertaken *                                          E.B.                                     10th February, 1933.
