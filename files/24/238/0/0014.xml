(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC             MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-;COPY NO.SECRETCP.  45 ( 33) .CABINET.INDIA.          Appreciation of the Political Situation bythe Government of India, dated 22nd February 1933.          Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the setretary of State  for India.
202Confidential Appreciation cf the Political Situation in India dated 22nd February 1933,  issued on the   authority of the Secretary of State for India.          There have &quot;been no incidents of outstandingpolitical importance during the last month and the generalsituation remains unchanged.          In regard to the constitutional proposals,  the liberals, or certain sections of them, appear to be paving theway for  an attack on the Whit^e Paper when it appears.  Theirviews have been put forward in a manifesto issued by theleading Liberals of Bombay which has received the approval ofthe United Provinces Liberal Association.  The statement puts forward  as essential conditions of the new constitution thefollowing: full and unfettered responsible government inProvinces (2) central responsibility,  which term is toinclude  (a) control of purse,  (b) right of Indian legislature to determine the economic policy including regulation ofexchange, currency,  industrial and commercial matters,  and(c) an increasing share of responsibility and control inconnection with defence and military;          (3) Central responsibility to be introducedsimultaneously with provincial autonomy; and          (4) Safeguards to be only for a fixed transition period and to be demonstrable in the interest of India.          They add &quot;applying these tests to the contemplatedscheme of constitutional reform as it has emerged from thediscussions at the conference,  the signatories are constrainedto observe, that unless materially altered,  it wouldgrievously fall short of these essentials and will fail tosecure the approval and support of any section of
                                                         9 AO                                                        2.responsible public  opinion  in  India&quot;.  At the sane tine,Liberals have joined in and  indeed led the demand for therelease of political prisoners, and it is not easy to distinguish their attitude,  either in this matter or inrelation to the constitution,  from the more moderate sectionof Congress.  On the other hand, many of the delegates whohave returned from  the Conference have emphasised itsachievement and there is probably a large body of moderate opinion which would willingly  accept the constitution asindicated at the Conference, provided there is no undue delay.          The decision of the  Governor-General in regard tothe Bills designed  to secure right of temple entry tountouchable classes was announced in the middle of January;sanction was accorded to the introduction of Bills in theCentral Legislature and not  in the Provincial Council ofMadras, but at the  same time it was made clear thatGovernment would take steps  to see that the Bills were fully  discussed and that adequate time was given to allclasses of the Hindu community to form and express their considered Views.   This did  not satisfy Congress reformerswho hoped to carry  the Bills through Madras Council with little opposition, while the orthodox section of the Hinducommunity would have been better pleased if sanction to the &apos;introduction of the Sills had  been refused.  They have,however,  been reassured by the refusal of Government to give any unusual facility for Bills during the current session,a decision which is approved by many members of theLegislative Assembly.  Meanwhile opposition to the Bills andto Mr. Gandhi&apos;s activities in  connection with this questionis consolidating and, as was anticipated in the lastappreciation,  these discussions are causing a serious split

Pandit M.M.Malaviya, himself an orthodox Hindu closely connected with Benares, now definitely opposes even indirect interference &quot;by Legislature in themanagement of temples and considers it &quot;wrong and unjust notto decide the question by peaceful persuasion only&quot;.  At the opposite extreme, Doctor Ambedkar, the champion of theunto-achables, contends that &quot;a mere amendment of the Hinducode by the mere inclusion in it of provisions to permittemple entry for all makes a religion of equality of socialstatus&quot;.  He attacks the whole of the caste system andpresses for social and economic uplift,  a problem which mr. Gandhi had allowed to recede into the background in hiszeal for the Bills,  which he now explains are designedmerely to test caste Hindus&apos;  feelings.  Opinion is growingthat Mr. Gandhi has made a serious tactical error in raising a question which has disturbed orthodox Hindus sopro foundly.          Widespread attempts were made,  especially in thelarger towns such as ivladras,  Calcutta, Bombay, Jubbulporeand Patna,  to revive interest in the Civil disobedience movement by celebration of Independence Day on 26th January,but demonstrations were controlled without difficulty,though in some centres only after a number of arrests hadbeen made.  It is significant that these demonstrations are constantly being organised in spite of the lack of success,and this fact shows that in many places the left wing of congress still pins its faith on the Civil disobedience movement and is in favour of carrying on the fight.  Otherswould prefer to abandon the movement and concentrate on the capture of new councils but these appear to be still in a minority.  Both parties would welcome a truce if it couldbe obtained without diminution of prestige but they are at

It may bethought that a position of stalemate has been reached but,as the Viceroy pointed out in his recent speech in theAssembly,  it is more probable that the march of events will gradually carry those still pledged to the policy of CivilDisobedience further and further away from their sterilemethods.          The continued efforts of the police in Bengalagainst the terrorist movement have recently met with considerable success.  Some useful arrests of leaders have been made recently but the most conspicuous successhas just been obtained by the arrest of the leader of theChittagong Armoury raid of April 1930,  Surya Sen, who for nearly three years had remained at liberty and was probably in the main responsible for the continuance of terroristactivities in that part of Bengal.
