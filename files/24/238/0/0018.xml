MOST  SECRET.PROPOSALS FOR INDIAN  CONSTITUTIONAL                        REFORM.                     INTRODUCTION.               The White Paver of December, 1981.   1.  IN  December  1981  both  Houses  of  Parliament adopted  a motion expressing approval of the Indian policy  of  His Majeaty&apos;sGovernment, as announced to the  Indian  Pound  Table Conferenceand  set out in Command Paper  8972.   That policy, stated in thebroadest  terms, involved  the prosecution  of  further inquiries  and discussion with the object of finding a suitable basis for the conver-sion  of the present system of government in India  into a responsiblygoverned Federation of States and  Provinces, on the understandingthat  the responsible Government so established must be qualified bylimitations in certain  directions,  which limitations have  commonlybeen described  by the  compendious term &quot; safeguards.&quot;   2.  Having pursued  their further  inquiries  and  discussions,including  a  third  session  of  the Pound  Table  Conference,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government are now in a position to indicate with greaterprecision and in fuller detail their proposals for  an Indian Constitu-tion; and it is  their intention, as indicated by the  Secretary of  Statefor India to the House of Commons on the 27th June last, to inviteboth Houses of Parliament to set  up a Joint Select Committee toconsider these  proposals in consultation with Indian representatives,and  to  report  upon them.   It will thereafter be the  duty of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to re-examine their proposals in the light ofthe  Joint   Select  Committee&apos;6  report  and  to  introduce  a  Billembodying  their  own  final plans.          The  form and purpose  of the present  document.   8.  It  should  be  made plain at the outset that although theproposals  are set out below in the interests of clarity in the form of short paragraphs or clauses, the language used in so describing themmust not in general  be taken as representing  the  language whichwould actually be  used if  they  were presented in  statutory  form.Nor  must it be assumed that the present proposals are in all respectsso complete and final  that a  Bill would contain  nothing which  isnot covered by this White Paper.  At the same time it is hoped thatthe Proposals,  read in the light of this Introduction, will make clear the principles which His Majesty&apos;s Government have followed.   4.   One further explanation of the scope of this document shouldbe given.   It is unnecessary for the present purpose for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in  anticipation  of  the discussions  in  Parliament,  to marshal and elaborate here the general arguments  in justification of their Proposals.  It  is not sought in this document to do more than to explain their exact  nature and intended effect.                   THE  FEDERATION OF  INDIA.             The processes involved in  its formation.    5.   The conception of a Federation of States and Provinces, andthe  processes  involved in  its  formation  necessitate  a  completereconstruction  of the  existing  Indian Constitution;  these proposals     [8174-1J                                            B
 are accordingly based  on the assumption  that  the  existing Govern- ment of India Act  (which  is a consolidation of  the  series of statutes relating to  the  government of India, the  earliest  of  which  dates from the 18th century) will be repealed in toto, and will be replaced by the Act which will  ultimately embody the decision of  Parliament. The problems presented by the legal and constitutional reconstruction are briefly as follows.    6.  Federation elsewhere has usually resulted from a pact entered into by a number of political units, each possessed of sovereignty or at  least  of  autonomy, and  each agreeing  to  surrender  to  the new central organism  which their pact creates an identical range of powers and jurisdiction, to be exercised  by  it on their behalf to the same extent for each one of them individually and for the Federa.- tion as a whole.   India, however, has little in common with historical precedents of this kind.  In the first place, British India  is a unitary State,  the administrative control of which is by law centred in  the Secretary  of State in some respects  in  a statutory  corporation known as the Secretary of  State  in  Council in whom  are vested powers of control  over &quot; all  acts, operations  and  concerns  which. relate to the government or revenues of  India &quot;;  and  such powers as appertain to the provincial Governments in  India  are derived through the Central Government by a species of delegation from this central authority  and are exercised subject to his control.  It follows that  the Provinces have  no original  or  independent  powers  or authority to surrender.    7.  The  States, on the other hand, though they are under  the suzerainty of the King, are  not part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions at all. Their contact with British India has hitherto been maintained by  the conduct of relations with their Bulers  through the Governor-General in Council.   Moreover, since Parliament  cannot  legislate directly for their territories, the range of authority to be conferred upon  the Federal Government and Legislature in relation to the States  must be determined by agreement with their Bulers;  and  the  States have made it plain that they are  not prepared to transfer to a Federal Government the same  range of authority in their territories as it is expedient and possible  to confer upon it in relation to the Provinces. The position will  therefore  necessarily be that in the Indian Federa- tion the range of powers to be exercised by the Federal Government and Legislature will differ in relation to the two classes of units which compose it.    8.   For the purpose of meeting  these conditions, it is proposed to set up a Federal Legislature,  consisting of elected representatives of British India and of representatives of Indian States to be appointed by their Bulers, and a  Federal Executive consisting of the Governor- General representing the Crown, aided and  advised by a Council of Ministers, who will  be  responsible (subject  to the qualifications to be explained later) to the  Legislature  so composed, and to  endow these authorities with powers  and functions in relation to British India and with  such powers and functions in relation to the  States  as  the States-members of  the  Federation  will formally accept as being of full force and effect within  their  territories.   Full  liberty will,  of course, be reserved to  the Crown  to refuse to  accept the accession of any State to the Federation if it is sought on terms incompatible with  the scheme of  Federation embodied in the Constitution Act.    9.   In  order  to  effect the transition from the existing constitu- tional position of the States and British India briefly indicated above, it will be necessary at  the  outset (see  paragraph 1 of the Proposals) to resume  into the  hands of the  Crown all powers appertaining and incidental  to  the  government  of  British  India  and  all  rights, authority  and  jurisdiction,  whencesoever   derived,  exercisable  in relation to  the  States.   So  much  of  this  corpus   of  govern- mental  powers,   authority  and jurisdiction  as  is  requisite   for the  government  of the Federation  of  India  will  be  apportioned between the  Governor-General, the  Governors, and other appropriate authorities to be  established by the Constitution  Act.   The  powers
now exercisable  by the Crown in  relation to the States through  theGovernor-General of India in Council, except in so far as they  arerequisite for Federal purposes and the rulers have assented to theirtransfer to the appropriate Federal authority for those purposes, willbe exercised by the Crownfs representative in his capacity of Viceroy,and these powers will be outside the scope of the Federal Constitution.    10.  The office of  Governor-General of the Federation  will  be constituted by Letters Patent,  and that document will set out  thepowers  which the Governor-General will exercise  as the King&apos;representative;  that is to say, the powers expressly conferred on himby  the Constitution Act and such other powers, not inconsistent withthat Act,  as His Majesty may  be  pleased to delegate to  him.   TheGovernor-General himself will receive a Commission under the RoyalSign Manual appointing him  to his office; and he will exercise andperform the powers and duties attaching to his  office in such manner as may be directed by the Instrument of Instructions which he will receive from the King.  The same arrangements ?nutatis mutandisare contemplated in the case of the Governor of each Province.    It is intended  that the  Viceroy shall in  future  be  recognised as  holding  a separate office  which will also  be  constituted   byLetters Patent, and the latter  will serve as the means of conferring onthe Governor-General,  in the capacity of Viceroy, the powers of  theCrown in relation to  the States outside the  Federal sphere.   Withthese the Constitution Act will not, of course, be concerned.    11.  So far as British India is concerned, the  first step requisitein the transfer  from  a unitary to a federal polity is to define  by statute the jurisdiction and competence of the Federal and Provincialauthorities respectively or, in other words, to  create Provinces withan  autonomy  of their own,  and  to  assign to them a defined and exclusive  share  of the activities of  government.   It  is  accordingly proposed to declare  that the  executive power and authority in eachof the  Governors&apos; Provinces is vested in the King and is  exercisableby the Governor as the King&apos;s representative; to constitute a Councilof Ministers to  aid  and advise the Governor,  and a  Legislature of elected representatives of the  provincial populations  to  whom  theMinisters will be responsible; and to define  the  competence of thisLegislature  (and of the Federal  Legislature) in  terms of  subjects,some of  which   will  be  exclusively assigned  to  the Federal and provincial Legislatures respectively,  while over others both Federaland Provincial  Legislatures  will  exercise a concurrent jurisdiction,with appropriate provisions for  resolving conflicts of laws.    The Date and Conditions for the Inauguration of Federation.    12.  It will be apparent that the mere passing of the ConstitutionAct  will not of  itself  suffice  to  bring the Federation  into  being.Apart  from  the  preparatory  processes  required  in British  India,which  cannot be  effectively commenced until the Constitution Act ison the Statute  Book, and which must inevitably occupy some time the preparation of new  and enlarged  electoral rolls for the Provincialand Federal  Legislatures,  and the demarcation of constituencies are matters in  point the final discussions with the States with regard totheir Instruments of Accession and the execution of the latter cannotbe undertaken  until the Act which will be the basis of the Princes&apos;accession has been passed, for until that time  arrives the  States willnot be in  possession of complete knowledge  of the character and powers of the Federation to which they are asked to accede.  So far asthe States  are concerned, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government propose  as thecondition to  be satisfied before the Federal Constitution  is broughtinto operation that the rulers of  States representing not less  than half the aggregate population of the Indian  States and entitled to notless  than half the  seats to be allotted to the  States in the federal legislature shall  have executed  Instruments  of  Accession.   they further propose that  the Federation  shall be brought into being by[8174-1]
Eoyal  Proclamation, but  that the Proclamation shall not be  issueduntil both Houses of Parliament have presented an Address  to theCrown  with a prayer for  its promulgation.   Another prerequisite ofa  financial  character  to  the inauguration  of responsible  federal government is dealt with in paragraph 82.   18.   At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinionthat the arrangements for bringing  the Constitution Act into  opera-tion  must not be such as to admit of the introduction  of the  newautonomous constitutions in the Provinces  under conditions  whichwill  leave Federation  as  a mere  contingency in the future.   It  isprobable  that it  will be found  convenient, or  even necessary,  thatthe new  Provincial  Governments should be brought into being inadvance of the  changes in the Central Government  and the entry of the States.   But  the  coming  into  being  of  the   autonomousProvinces will only be the first step  towards  the complete Federationfor which the Constitution Act will  provide.   If this  programme should be frustrated by causes  beyond the control  of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, they  will take steps to  review the  whole position inconsultation  with Indian  opinion.   Provision will accordingly be required in  the Constitution  Act forthe period, however short it may be,  by which Provincial autonomymay precede  the complete establishment of the  Federation.   Thenature of the transitory arrangements contemplated for this purpose is explained in paragraph 205  of  the  Proposals.                      The Federal Executive.    14.   The  executive  power  and  authority  of  the  Federationwill be  vested in the  King and will be exercised  by the Governor-General  as  his  representative, aided  and advised by a Council  ofMinisters responsible to the Legislature and containing representativesboth of  British India and of the States.  But whereas in the Provincesthe Council  of Ministers will be entitled, as will be seen from a laterparagraph, to tender advice to the Governor on all matters which fall within the scope of provincial administration, other than the  use  ofpowers  described by the Constitution Act as  being  exercisable by theGovernor at  his  discretion,  the  transfer  of responsibility at theCentre  will  not be  co-extensive with the  range  of  the federal governments   activities.    Certain  Departments,  namely,   those concerned   with  Defence,  External  Affairs  and  Ecclesiasticaladministration,   are   to  be  entrusted  to  the  Governor-Generalpersonally,  and  these matters  he  will control  in responsibility  toHis Majesty&apos;s Government and Parliament.  In the  exercise, more-over,  of  certain  specific powers to be conferred by the  Constitution onthe Governor-General, and to be expressed as being exercisable at his discretion, the Governor-General will be entitled to act  without seekingadvice from his Ministers.   On other matters, Ministers will tenderadvice  to the Governor-General and  the Governor-General will  be guided by that advice,  unless so to be guided would in his  judgment be inconsistent with the  fulfilment of any of the purposes for which  hewill be  declared by the Constitution Act to be charged  with a &quot; special responsibility,&quot;  in which case the  Governor-General will act, notwith-standing the advice tendered to him  in such manner as  he deemsrequisite for the discharge of those &quot;special responsibilities.&quot;    15.   For the purpose  of assisting him in the administration of the reserved Departments the  Governor-General will be empowered toappoint at   his  discretion not  more  than three  Counsellors  whosesalaries and conditions of service will be prescribed  by  His Majesty in Council.  The Governor-General will not be restricted in any way in his  choice of these Counsellors;  the sole consideration  will be to select the individual best  suited,  in the  Governor-General&apos;s opinion, for the office, wherever he  may be found.  The Counsellors will be ex ojjicio members of both Chambers  of  the  Legislature,  though without the right to vote; they are  not  therefore   included in the numbers mentioned  in. the  following paragraphs.
                     The Federal Legislature.   16.  The  Federal  Legislature  will  be  bi-cameral,  the  twoChambers possessing  identical powers, except  that Money Bills andVotes of Supply will be initiated in the Lower Chamber, and  that the range of the functions of the Upper Chamber in relation to supply will be less  extensive than those of the Lower Chamber (see  para-graph 48 of  the Proposals).  Equality of powers necessitates  arrange-ments made for the solution of deadlocks;  the arrangements proposed are set out in paragraph 41 of the Proposals.   17.  The Lower Chamber, or  House of Assembly, of the federal legislature  will  consist of  875  members, of  whom  125  will  beappointed by the rulers of States-members of the Federation.   Theremaining 250 members will be representatives of British India andtheir  seats  will  be allocated  to  the Provinces  and  to  the severalcommunities and interests in each province in the manner indicatedin Appendix  II.   The British  Indian  members will  be  directly elected.   18.  The Upper Chamber, or Council of State, will consist of amaximum  of 260 members,  of  whom  100  will   be appointedby  the rulers  of the  States-members  of the  Federation.   TheBritish Indian members, 150 in number,  will, for the most  part,be elected  by the members  of the Provincial Legislatures by themethod of the single  transferable vote, thus rendering unnecessaryany specific allocation of the seats on a communal basis, except inthe case  of  those minorities (the  Europeans, the Anglo-Indians and indian Christians) whose representatives  in the  Provincial  Legisla-tures will be insufficiently numerous to  provide the necessary quota.The  arrangement proposed for  these minorities  and the  numbersof seats  assigned to  each Province  are  indicated in  Appendix I.It may  be  of  interest to  point  out  that  if the  voting should proceed,  in  all Provinces, entirely  on  communal lines, that  is tosay if  every  elector  in  using his  first and succeeding preferencesgave priority to  all  candidates  of  his own  community, then thefollowing result  is to be expected.   The communal complexion of10 seats would  be indeterminate.   Out  of the remaining  140 the communal percentages  would be :  General 59  per cent, including6 per cent. Depressed Classes, Sikh 2 per cent., Muslim 32 per cent.,Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians  and Europeans together 7 per cent.There  would be  no  reason to  suppose  that  the  effect  of the10  indeterminate seats  would  be  to   modify  these  percentagesmaterially.   In addition the Governor-General will  be empowered  to nominatenot  more  than  ten  members   (not officials),  thus  providing  anopportunity  of adding to the Chamber  a small group of the elder-statesman type.   19.  The allocation of the seats  among the  States-members ofthe Federation, both  for the Federal Assembly and Council  of  state is at present (    March, 1988)  under  discussion with rulers.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government are accordingly unable  at the moment to putforward  specific  proposals.   But their  view is  that  the  detailedallocation of  seats which  will eventually  be  provided for in theConstitution Act should be based, in the case of the Council of State,on  the rank and importance of  the  State  as  indicated  by thepermanent salute and  other  factors, and  that in the  case of theLower Chamber  it should be based in the  main on population.             The franchise for the  Federal  Legislature.   20.  Since the British Indian seats in the Upper Chamber of theFederal Legislature will be filled by indirect election by the provincial legislatures,  no  question of franchise  qualifications  arises, thoughcertain specific property or other qualifications will be  required inmembers of the  Upper House.   21.  The franchise of the Lower Chamber of the Federal Legisla-ture  will, for practical  purposes, be the  existing franchise for the
Gpresent Provincial Legislatures.  In  Bihar and Orissa the qualifica-tions will be changed, but the character and numerical effect will be substantially as at present.  In the Central  Provinces,  where theexisting percentage of enfranchisement is unusually low, an alterna-tive  franchise of the  same  character but on a wider  scale has been worked out  by the Local Government.   The existing franchise in allprovinces is essentially based on property.  In adopting it (with the modifications  referred  to  above)  as  the  franchise  for  the LowerChamber of the Federal Legislature it is proposed to supplement theproperty q alifieation by an educational  qualification common to menand  women, and, where necessary,  by a differential franchise such asto produce an electorate of approximately  2 per cent, of  the popula-tion  of the Scheduled Castes* (hitherto  known as Depressed Classes)in every province, except in Bihar and  Orissa, in which  the generalpercentage of enfranchisement is lower than elsewhere,  and in theNorth-West Frontier  Province and Sind, where  the  numbers of the scheduled Castes  are negligible.   Provision  will also be  made  foran electorate for the  seats to be provided for Commerce, Labour andother special  interests  in the Federal  Lower Chamber.   22.  The  details   of  the  franchise proposed  are  set  out  inAppendix IV.  It should be emphasised that  pending preparation ofan electoral  roll these qualifications are  inevitably  to  some extentstated in general  terms, and that modifications of  detail may befound necessary on various points once the preparation of the rollis undertaken.  Registration of claimants in respect of an educationalqualification will,  at  any  rate  for the  first two elections, be onlyon  application  by  the potential  voter.  The  effect of  acceptanceof the Proposals in question would be to enfranchise  between 2 and3 per cent,  of the total population  of British India.  The gross totalelectorate would, so far as  can be  judged, amount to between 7 andS millions.    23.   Although the Reserved Departments will be administered bythe Governor-General on his sole responsibility, it would be impossible in practice for the Governor-General to conduct the affairs of these departments in isolation from the other activities of his Government,and undesirable that he should attempt to do so, even if it were in factpossible : in particular, he will be bound to recognise that the defenceof India must to an increasing extent  be  the concern of the indian people,  and  not  of  the  British  Government  alone.   A  prudentGovernor-General  would  therefore  keep  his  Ministers  and the advisers whom he has selected to assist him in the  Reserved Depart-ments in the closeBt contact; and,  without blurring the line which will necessarily divide on the one hand his  personal responsibility for the reserved Departments, and, on the other hand, the responsibility ofMinisters to  the  Legislature for the matters  entrusted  to theircharge,  he  would so arrange the  conduct  of  executive  businessthat  he  himself,  his Counsellors and  his  responsible Ministers,are  given  the  fullest  opportunity  of  mutual   consultation and discussion of all matters and  there will necessarily be many such which call for co-ordination of policy.   His  Majesty&apos;6  government intend to secure the embodiment of this principle in  appropriate termsthey contemplate that the Instrument  should  contain a  direction tothe following effect:  &quot; without derogation from your responsibilitiesyou  shall  encourage  joint  deliberation  between  yourself,  yourCounsellors and your Ministers, and in particular you shall make ityour endeavour to secure  that the views of your Ministers in relationto Defence expenditure shall be ascertained and duly weighed beforethe Military Budget is laid before the Legislature.&quot; At the same time,the Instrument of Instructions will make  it clear, without ambiguity,that whatever  consultation between the   Governor-General and  hisresponsible Ministers  may take  place  upon matters arising  in  the reserved Departments,  the responsibility for the  decisions  takenis the Governor-General&apos;8 and the Governor-General&apos;s  alone.   * Tho Cnstos ill each Province scheduled   as requiring spocial doctoralprotection aro onuinoratcd in Appendix VIII.Governor-General&apos;s relations with his  Ministers.For example,
    24.   A different problem presents itself in regard to the Governor -General&apos;s relations with his Ministers outside the ambit of the ReservedDepartments, i.e., in the Departments which will be entrusted to thecharge of Ministers responsible for the conduct of their administrationof them to the Legislature.  In this sphere Ministers, as  already explained, will have a constitutional right to tender advice, and theGovernor-General will, except to the extent  and in  the circumstancesexplained below, be guided by that advice.  The problem is so to define the  circumstances in which he  will  be  entitled to act  on his ownexclusive responsibility.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government consider thatthe  most satisfactory course will  be:     (a) the enactment of provisions in the Constitution  laying down          that the Governor-General  has  a  &quot; special responsibility,&quot;          not for spheres of administration, but for certain clearly          indicated  general purposes, and that for securing these          purposes  he  is  to  exercise  the powers conferred upon          him by the Constitution  Act in accordance with directions          contained in his Instrument of  Instructions; and    (b) the insertion in  the Instrument of  Instructions inter alia of a          direction to the effect  that the Governor-General  is to be          guided by his Ministers&apos; advice unless so to be guided would,          in his  judgment,  be inconsistent  with a &quot;special  respon-          sibility  &quot; imposed upon  him by  the  Constitution  Act, in          which  case  he  is to act, notwithstanding  his  Ministers&apos;          advice,  in such  manner as  he judges  requisite for the due          fulfilment of his special  responsibility.   It will be apparent  from this  proposal that the Instrument of instructions will assume  a  position of great importance as an ancillaryto the Constitution Act,  and His  Majesty&apos;s Government propose that appropriate arrangements shall be made to secure for this document.and  for any subsequent  amendments  proposed to be made in it, theapproval of both Houses of Parliament.                   *   25.   It remains to  indicate the matters or purposes in  respectof which the Governor-General  should be declared,  in accordancewith  the proposals in  the preceding paragraph,  to have  a  special responsibility in relation to the operations of the Federal Government.It is proposed that they should be the following :      (i) the prevention  of  grave menace  to  the  peace  or tranquillity          of India or of  any  part thereof;    (ii) the safeguarding of the financial  stability  and credit of the          Federation;   (iii) the safeguarding of  the legitimate interests of minorities;    (iv) the securing  to  the members of the Public Services  of any          rights  provided for them  by  the  Constitution  and  the          safeguarding  of their  legitimate  interests;    (v) the protection of the rights of any Indian State;    (vi) the prevention  of commercial discrimination;   (vii) any matter which  affects  the  administration of the  Reserved          Departments.   26.   Before  describing in  detail  the  scope  and purpose  of  the items in this  list, it is desirable  to explain the precise  effect whichis contemplated as the result of imposing upon the  Governor-Generalthese  &quot;special   responsibilities.&quot;  In the  first   place,  it  shouldbe  made  clear  that   unless   and   until  the   Governor-Generalfeels  called upon  to  differ from  his  Ministers  in  the discharge  ofa  &quot;special responsibility,&quot;  the  responsibility  of  Ministers for  thematters  committed  to   their charge  remains complete.   To  takea  concrete instance,  it  will  clearly  be  the  duty  of  Ministersrather than  of  the Governor-General himself,  to  ensure  that  theadministration of  their departments is so conducted that minoritiesare not subjected  to unfair or prejudicial  treatment.   The  intentionof attributing  to the Governor-General a special responsibility  for theprotection of minorities is to enable him, in any case where he regardsthe proposals  of the Minister in chai-ge of a department as likely tobe unfair or prejudicial to  a  particular minority, in  the last resort toinform  the  Minister  concerned   (or the  Ministers  as   a  body,
if they generally support the proposals of their colleague), that hewill be  unable to accept the  advice  tendered to  him.  Nor is itcontemplated that the Governor-General, having been vested with&quot;special responsibilities&quot; of the kind  indicated, will either  wish, orfind  it  necessary,  to  be  constantly  overruling  his  Ministers&apos;advice.   The  present  proposals  in   general  necessarily  proceed on the  basic  assumption that  every   endeavour will  be made  by those  responsible  for  working the  Constitution  to approach  theadministrative problems which will present themselves  in the spiritof  partners  in a common  enterprise.   In  the  great bulk of cases,therefore, in day-to-day administration, where questions might ariseaffecting the Governor-General&apos;s &quot;special responsibilities&quot;  mutualconsultation should result in agreement,  so that no question would arise of  bringing the Governor-General&apos;s  special responsibilities into play.    27.   Reverting now to the list of&apos;&apos; special responsibilities&apos;&apos; in para-graph 25, the necessity for the items numbered (i), (iii) and (iv) followsas  a matter of course from previous  statements of His Majesty&apos;governments  policy.  With  regard  to  item  (vii) it  is  apparent that if, for  example, the  Governor-General were to  be free to followhis  own judgment  in relation to Defence policy   only  in  regardto  matters  falling strictly  within the  ambit of the department ofDefence, he might find that proposals made in another department incharge of a  responsible Minister are in direct conflict with  the lineof policy he regards as essential for purposes connected with Defence,and consequently that the discharge of  his responsibilities for defence would be gravely impaired if he accepted the advice of  the  minister responsible  for the charge of the other department  in question.  If,therefore, such a situation is to be avoided, it is impossible to  securethe object in view otherwise than by expressing the Governor-General&apos;s&quot; special responsibility &quot;  in some such terms as those  indicated initem  (vii).    28.   As regards item (v), it should be explained that this is  not intended to give the Governor-General any special powers  vis-a-vis the States in relation to matters arising in the Federal sphere proper;the necessary powers having been transferred by the States in theirInstruments of  Accession,  such  matters  will  be  regulated  inaccordance with the normal provisions of the Constitution Act.  Nor isit  intended  that  the inclusion of this item should  be  regarded as having any bearing on the direct relations  between the Crown and  theStates.   These will be matters for which the Constitution  will make no provision and which will fall to be dealt with by the Viceroy,  who willbe  the Governor-General in a  capacity independent of the Federalorganisation.  It  may be, however, that measures are proposed  by  theFederal  Government,  acting  within   its  constitutional  rights  inrelation  to   a  Federal  subject,  or in relation  to a  subject not directly  affecting the  States  at all,  which,  if pursued to  a con-clusion,  would affect prejudicially rights of a  State in relation towhich that State had transferred no jurisdiction. Or, again, policiesmight be proposed or events arise  in  a Province which would tendto prejudice the  rights of a  neighbouring  State.   In such  cases itis  evident  that   it  must  be  open   to  the  Crown,  through theGovernor-General or the Governor,  as the case may be,  to ensurethat the particular  course  of  action is so  modified as  to  maintainthe integrity of rights enjoyed by the ctate by Treaty or otherwise.    29.   Item (vi) is intended to enable the Governor-General to dealwith proposals for administrative action which  he  regards as likelyto have discriminatory effects.   As regards legislative discrimination,detailed  proposals  will  be  found  in   paragraphs   122-124  of theProposals.   Any  legislative  measure,  Federal or Provincial,  whichwas inconsistent  with those proposals  would  be invalid,  and couldbe  challenged as such  in the  Courts;  and  the  Governor-General orthe Governor, as the case may bo, wrould be entitled to act otherwise than in accordance with his Ministers&apos; advice, if he considered thatsuch  advice involved  discriminatory  action  in the  administrativesphere.   The Governor-Generabs powers would enable him to reserveany Bill  on which he has doubts.
   30.  Tho  second  item  in  the  list  of  special  responsibilitiesdeserves to  be noticed at rather greater length since  it involves thewhole question of what have become known as &quot;financial safeguards.&quot;Subject to  the  powers  conferred upon  the  Governor-General  bythis  responsibility, and  subject to what  is stated below as regardsthe  Reserve   Bank,  it  is   intended  that  the  Finance  of  theFederation should, like  all other  subjects, except those included inthe Reserved Departments,  be entrusted to the Ministry.   Unlessoccasion arises for the  exercise  of  the  Governor-General&apos;s special powers, it will therefore  be for the Ministry, and  the Ministry  alone,to take decisions on  all  such matters as  the means  to be  used  for raising the  necessary revenues,  for  allocating expenditure in the responsible  field,  and for the programme of  external and  internalborrowing.   The service of certain obligations, e.g., the service of the  Debt,the salary of  the  Governor-General, the  salaries  and pensions  of judges of the Federal Court, will be a &quot;charge&quot; on the revenues of the Federation; other expenditure will be appropriated annually,but  certain  Heads&quot;  of   it,  in particular the expenditure on the reserved Departments, will not require a vote of  the  Legislature.   31.  The  object of the Governor-GeneraPs special responsibilityfor &quot; the safeguarding  of the financial  stability and  credit  of theFederation&quot; is to confer  on him powers to step in, if the need  should arise,  in  the  event  of  the  policy  of  his Ministry  in  respect,  forexample,  of budgeting  or borrowing  being such as  to be likely  inthe Governor-General&apos;s  opinion to endanger seriously the provisionof resources to meet  the requirements of his Reserved departments or any of the obligations of the Federation,  whether directly,  or indirectly  by prejudicing  India&apos;s  credit  in  the  money-markets of the world.  The definition of  this special responsibility is  drawn in somewhat wide terms  not in order to diminish the field of responsi-bility of the Ministry, but owing to the difficulty  of giving a detailedspecification of  financial operations or  measures  which might on occasion endanger stability  and  call for the  use of  the Governor-General&apos;s powers.  In order that  assistance may  be available  to him in the discharge of this special responsibility, the  Governor-general will  be empowered to appoint a Financial Adviser (without executive powers), whose services  would also be available  to the Ministry.   32.  The  proposals  relating to responsibility  for  the Finance ofthe  Federation are based on the assumption  that before  the firstFederal Ministry  comes into being,  a  Reserve  Bank, free from political influence,  will have been set  up by  Indian legislation,and  be already successfully operating.  The Bank would be entrusted with  the  management   of currency  and  exchange.   His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  and the Government of India are taking every step in their power  to facilitate and expedite the  establishment of  aReserve Bank on sound  principles.  Some, however, of the conditionsnecessary for  the  successful  establishment and operation of  such a bank,  depending as  they do on  world economic conditions, are  not within their control.   If a  situation should arise in  which  all other requirements for the inauguration of the Federation were  satisfied,but  it had  so far proved  impossible  to start  the  Reserve Banksuccessfully, or if financial  and economic conditions were such as torender it impracticable  to  supply the new Federal   and provincial governments  at  the outset of  their  careers  with  the  necessaryresources to ensure their solvency, it would, inevitably, be necessaryto reconsider the position and determine in  the light of  the thencircumstances what  course  should be pursued.   If,  unfortunately,such reconsideration  became necessary,  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare  pledged  to  call  once more  into  conference representatives  ofIndian opinion.   83.  Apart from  tho Reserved Departments, and the  specified&quot; special responsibilities &quot; of the Governor-General outside the sphere of those Departments, there is a  third category of  matters  in which            * Soo pnragruph 49 of tho Proposals for  full  list.
the Governor-General will not be under any constitutional obligationto seek, or,  having  sought,  to  be guided by, ministerial  advice.For  this purpose certain  specified powers will  be  conferred  by theConstitution on the Governor-General and will be expressed as beingexercisable  &quot; at his discretion.&quot;  In this  category  of &quot; discretionarypowers,&quot; the precise range of which it will be impossible exhaustivelyto  foresee  until  the.  drafting  of  the  Constitution  has  reachedcompletion, His  Majesty&apos;s Government anticipate that the following matters will be included :     (a) The power to dissolve, prorogue,  and summon the Legislature :    (b) The power  to assent  to, or withhold assent  from, Bills, or  to          reserve  them  for  the  signification of  His  Majesty&apos;s          pleasure;    (c) The grant of previous sanction to  the introduction of  certain          classes of legislative measures;    (d) The power  to summon a  joint Session of the Legislature  in          cases of  emergency, where observance of  the  ordinary time          limit which, it was assumed, would  be prescribed  by the          Constitution would produce serious consequences.         Governor-General&apos;s relations rvith the  Legislature.   34.  It is also a necessary corollary of  what has  already been  said  &apos;that the special powers to be conferred  on the  Governor-General forthe purpose of enabling him to discharge  his responsibilities must besimilai-ly  exercisable  in his  discretion.   To  the  foregoing  must,therefore, be  added-   (c) The power to take action,  notwithstanding an  adverse  vote  in          the Legislature to be  dealt with more fully  below:   (/) The power to arrest the course of discussion of measures in the          Legislature also dealt with below;   (.or) The power  to  make rules of legislative  business in so far  as          these are required to provide for the due exercise of his          own powers  and responsibilities.   85.  It is not, in fact, sufficient merely to regulate the Governor-General&apos;s relations with his  responsible  Ministers, i.e.,  to regulatematters arising in  discussion amongst the members of the executiveGovernment.   It follows from previous declarations by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,  upon  which  these Proposals are  based, that  theGovernor-General  must  be  given  powers which  will enable  himeffectively to discharge the responsibilities entrusted to  him, whether for the  Reserved  Departments  or  the  &quot; special responsibilities&quot;indicated  above, if their discharge involves  action,  normally lyingwithin the functions of the Legislature,  to which the  Legislature willnot agree.   The general scheme underlying the Proposals  is  that,wherever  the  Governor-GeneraFs responsibilities  for  the ReservedDepartments, or his special  responsibilities,  are involved, he shouldbe  empowered not only to  act  without,  or, as the case may be,contrary to,  the  advice of  his Ministers, but also to take actionnotwithstanding  an adverse  vote of the  Legislature, whether  sucha vote relates to the passage of legislation or to  the  appropriationof funds.   86.  But  it will clearly be of importance to the fostering of the sense of responsibility in Ministers ^nd Legislature alike that roomshould not be left for doubt whether in any given  case the responsibilityfor the decision is, or is not,  that of the Ministers  or of the Legisla-ture as the case may be in  other words,  it is of importance that thespecial  powers of  the  Governor-General  should be so  framed as  tomake it plain  that the responsibility for the results of  their exerciselies upon  him.  The necessity for the use of the Governor-GeneraFslegislative  power may arise  through  the  refusal of Ministers to  beparties  to  a Bill,  or to  provisions in a  Bill, which  the  Governor-General regards as essential  to the discharge of his  responsibilities,or where the  Legislature rejects or  fails to pass  a Bill for which ministers  have  accepted  responsibility  and which  the  Governor-General regards  as essential; or the  Legislature may  alter  the Bill
to a form which would fail to  secure the object which the ministers and the Governor-General have in view.   87.  The essential point to be  secured,  in  both contingencies,is,  as  already  indicated, that when the  Governor-General  decidesthat the  discharge  of  his responsibilities  necessitates  a   courseof  action to  which  he  is unable  to obtain  the   consent  either of  his  Ministers  or  of  the  Legislature or perhaps  of  both the resulting  enactment should  not  purport to  be an  enactment of the Legislature  (as is  the  case  with Acts which the Governor-General  &quot;certifies&quot;  under the existing Government of India Act),and further  that its presentation to the Legislature should  be broughtabout by the personal intervention of  the Governor:General,  thathis responsibility for it should be manifest,  and that Ministers  shouldbe in no way compromised by  his action either with  their supporters in the Legislature  or their constituencies  in  the  country.  On  theother hand, it would be undesirable  to carry this  principle  to  thelogical extreme of placing all measures  for which the Governor-General  has himself to assume  responsibility  on   the  footing  ofOrdinances, the enactment of which involves no reference  to  theLegislature  at  all.   The Governor-GeneraPs  powers in this  regard should therefore be  such  as  to  enable him to  test opinion  in  theLegislature; if he finds a  majority  there in support  of  his policy noquestion  arises of  using his  special  powers.  If he  finds  only  a minority  in the Legislature in favour of his policy,  he would at all events secure that measure of  moral support, but  he  would cany out his policy on his own responsibility without compromising either theMinisters with their supporters in the Legislature, or the latter withtheir  constituencies.   It   is  accordingly  proposed  that measuresenacted by  the Governor-General  without the consent of the Legisla-ture should be described  as  &quot; Governor-GeneraPs Acts,&quot; and thata special form of  enacting words should be employed to distinguishthem from  Acts &quot;enacted by  the Governor-General  by and with theconsent  of both Chambers  of the Legislature.&quot;    88.   The corresponding powers proposed for the Governor-general in  the matter  of supply are based upon  the same  principles.   TheBudget will be framed by the Finance Minister in consultation withhis colleagues  and with the Governor-General.    The decision as  tothe appropriations required for  the Reserved Departments  and forthe discharge of the  functions  of the Crown in relation  to the indian states will, of  course, be taken by the Governor-General on his  own responsibility,  though he  will be  enjoined  by   his Instrument  of instructions to consult his Ministers before reaching any decision on appropriations  for   the  Department  of   Defence.   Appropriationsrequired for the non-reserved Departments  will be the responsibility ofMinisters.  But the proposals for raising revenue and for the appropria- tion of those revenues will be subject to the  common constitutional rule (see paragraph 45 of the Proposals) that, as  laid before the  Legislature,they  carry  a recommendation  from the representative of the  Crown.If  the Governor-General regards his Ministers&apos;  proposals for appro-appropriations as insufficient to  enable him  adequately to fulfil any of his &quot;special responsibilities,&quot;  he will be  entitled  to append  to the Budget   statement,  when  laid  before  the  Legislature, additional proposals for appropriation under any head  in respect of which he regards  his Ministers&apos;  proposals  as  inadequate.   These additional proposals (if any)  of the  Governor-General  will  be  distinguished  as such in  the Budget Statement, and whether they relate  to non-votable or to votable Heads of expenditure the Legis&apos;nature will  not be invited to vote  upon  them : in other words, the appropriations which  the Legislature will be  invited to vote will  be  those  proposed  by the Ministry.    89.   After the Legislature has discussed the  Budget as a whole and  has voted upon those proposals  for appropriations which are submitted to the  vote,  the Governor-General will be called upon to authenticate by his  own signature  the appropriations.   In authenti- cating  those under  the  non-votable  heads  he   will be  entitled  to include  in his  authentication the sums  additional  to. those proposed  by
his Ministers under those  Heads which he originally included in thebudget statement,  or  if he thinks fit reduced  sums.    He will be similarly  required  to  authenticate  the  Grants  as  voted  by  theLegislature, and in so doing he will be entitled,  if he regards this as necessary for the fulfilment of any of his &quot; special responsibilities,&quot; toinclude in his authentication any sums not in excess of those by whichthe Legislature may  have  reduced the  Grants submitted  to it.  Bythis procedure the Ministry on the one hand, and the Legislature onthe other, will  be left free  to exercise their respective responsibilities in the matter  of supply the &quot;Ministers, by  accepting responsibilityfor proposals for appropriations so far  as  and no farther than theyare prepared to hold themselves responsible  to  the  Legislature,  andthe Legislature, by recording their agreement or disagreement with ministers&apos; proposals: at the same  time, the Governor-General, if heis unable to accept the proposals of his Ministers, or the  decision ofthe Legislature, as consistent with the discharge of any of his special responsibilities, will be enabled to bring the  resulting appropriationsinto accord with  his own  estimates of  the  requirements, and,  ifnecessary, through his  special legislative powers to secure  that theAnnual Finance  Act provides him with resources  which will cover the appropriations  which he finally authenticates.    40.   It  will,  in  addition, be  necessary  to  arm  the Governor-General  with  a  legislative power which  is  capable of  immediateemployment in emergencies, either  when  the Legislature is notin  session  or,  if  it  is  in session,  to meet circumstances  whichnecessitate  immediate  action.   It is,  therefore,  proposed to  vestin  him   a   power  analogous  to  the  existing Ordinance-makingpower.   Indeed,  in  addition  to  such a power  to be placed atthe  disposal  of  the  Governor-General in  his discretion  for  the express purpose  of discharging his responsibilities  for  a ReservedDepartment, or  for  carrying out a &quot; special  responsibility,&quot;  HisMajesty&apos;s Government  are of opinion that  a  similar  power  mustnecessarily  be placed at the disposal of the Governor-General  actingwith  his  Ministers,  i.e.,  at the  disposal of  the  Federal  Govern-ment,  to meet eases of emergency when  the Legislature is not in session, the Ordinances  resulting therefrom being limited in durationto a specified period, unless previously revoked by the Legislatureafter its reassembly.    41.   Finally, it is proposed that the Constitution should containprovision requiring the previous  sanction of the  Governor-Generalacting in his discretion to  the introduction  of  any Bill  affecting are served  Department,   and  certain  other  matters  set  out  inParagraph 119 of the Proposals.    42.   It  is  perhaps desirable   to  summarise  very  briefly  theeffect of these Proposals.   The intention is  that the special powersof the Governor-General  properly so  described, namely, his  powerto obtain legislation and supply without the assent of the Legislature,will flow from  the responsibilities  specifically&apos; imposed upon  him andbe  exercisable only for the purpose of enabling  those responsibilities to  be implemented.   The responsibilities  to  be  imposed on theGovernor-General  by  the  Constitution will  be  of two kinds-an exclusive  responsibility  for the  administration  of the  ReservedDepartments,  and  a &quot;special  responsibility&quot;  for certain  definedpurposes  outside the  range of the Reserved  Departments.  On theadministration of the Reserved Departments, Ministers  will have no constitutional right to tender advice,  though, in practice, they will necessarily  be consulted;  nor will  they have any such right to  tenderadvice on the  exercise of any powers conferred  upon the Governor-General  for use in his discretion.  On all  other  matters ministers will be  constitutionally entitled to  tender advice, and  unless  thatadvice is felt by the Governor-General to be in conflict  with  one ofhis special  responsibilities he will be guided by  it.   If, in dischargeof  his  responsibility  for  a Reserved Department,  or  of a  special responsibility,  the Governor-General decides that  a legislative measureor  a vote of supply  to which the Legislature  has not assented  is essential, his special powers will enable him to  secure the enactment of  the measure or  the  provision of  the supply  in  question, but
Ministers will  not  have any constitutional  responsibility  for  his decision.   43.   It remains only to explain that in so far as the Governor-General  or a  Governor  is not  advised by  Ministers,  the  generalrequirements of constitutional theory necessitate that he should  beresponsible to  His Majesty&apos;s Government and  Parliament for any action he may take,  and that  the  Constitution should make this position clear.  In the case of a  Governor the chain  of responsibilitymust necessarily include the  Governor-General.   44.   The proposals indicated above have no reference  to situationswhere a complete breakdown of the constitutional machinery hasoccurred. It is the intention of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government that theConstitution should contain separate provision to meet such situations,should  they  unfortunately occur  either  in  a Province or in  theFederation  as  a whole, whereby  the  Governor-General  or  theGovernor, as the  case  may  be,  will be  given plenary authority  toassume all powers that he deems necessary for the purpose of carryingon the King&apos;s  Government.THE GOVERNORS&apos;  PROVINCES.

The eleven  provinces  named in  the margin will  becomeautonomous  units, the government  of each being administered  bya Governor representing  the King, aided and  advised by a  Councilof Ministers responsible  to the  Legislature  of the  Province.   TheCouncil of Ministers will be entitled to tender advice to the Governoron all matters which fall within the provincial sphere, other than theuse of powers described by the Constitution Act as exercisable by theGovernor at his discretion.   The Governor will be  guided  by theadvice tendered to him by Ministers,  unless so to be guided would be,in his  judgment, inconsistent  with the  fulfilment of  any of thepurposes for the  fulfilment of which he  will be  declared  by theConstitution  Act to be charged with a &apos;&apos; special responsibility &quot;;  inwhich case the Governor will be entitled, and indeed enjoined, to act,notwithstanding the advice tendered to him, in such manner  as  hedeems requisite for the discharge  of his special responsibilities.           *  Including Berar, subject to conditions which are                under discussion with His Exalted Highness                the Nizam.Madras,Bombay,Bengal,The united provinces,The Punjab,Bihar,Tho central provinces,&apos;Assam,The North-West frontier province.Sind,Orissa.

As  indicated above, the scheme for the Governor-GeneraPsresponsibilities and  powers will  be applicable in all respects to theGovernor in  relation to his  Ministers  and  Legislature, with  thefollowing  modifications: In the  provinces there will be no categoryexactly corresponding to the Reserved Departments of  the Governor-General,  though analogous  arrangements are intended in order toprovide for  the administration of frontier areas in  certain Provinceswhich,  from  the  primitive  nature of  their  populations and their general characteristics, will have  to  be excluded  from the normaloperation  of the Constitution.   With  this exception, the Governor&apos;special  powers will  flow from,  and be  expressed  as being requiredin order to  enable him to  discharge,  his &apos;&apos; special responsibilities&apos;&apos;only.   47.  As  regards  the &quot; special responsibilities&quot; of the Governors,these will be  identical with  those indicated in  the case of  theGovernor-General, save that the  first item on the list will necessarily be confined in scope to the Province,  or any part thereof, and not extend, as in the case of the Governor-General, to India as a whole,and  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government do not consider it necessary toimpose  on tho  Governors a special responsibility  for  the  financial stability of their Province.  But  in the case  of the Governors, it  willbe necessary to add  to the list of &quot; special responsibilities &quot; an itemrelating to tho execution of orders passed by  the Governor-General.
If the Governor-General is to be charged, as will be explained later,with the  general  superintendence of the  actions  of  Governors indischarge  of  their &quot;special responsibilities,&quot; and if, as has alreadybeen proposed, he is himself to have imposed upon him a &quot; special responsibility &quot;  for  the  prevention of  grave menace  to peace  andtranquillity throughout the  country, it follows that  he  must be in aposition to ensure that his instructions  to a Governor are actedupon;  and consequently that  the Governor must  be  in  a positionto act otherwise than on his Ministers&apos; advice, if such advice conflictswith  the  Governor-General&apos;s  instructions.  Finally,  it  will  benecessary to  impose,  upon the Governor a &quot; special responsibility &quot;for the administration of certain excluded areas, if, as seems probable,the arrangements for the administration of excluded  areas  involvetheir classification into two  categories, one  of which would  be placed under the exclusive control of the Governor, while the  other is made subject  to Ministerial control, but with  an over-riding power in theGovernor  obtained in the manner explained in earlier paragraphsthrough his  &quot;special responsibility.&quot;    48.  The   division of  legislative  powers  between Centre  andProvinces would no longer make  appropriate the  concentration in thehands of the  Governor-General of the power to legislate in emergencyby  Ordinance on provincial  matters and this power  will now be con-ferred  on  Governors also,  for   the  double  purpose   indicated inparagraph 40.                    The Provincial Legislature.    49.  The  Provincial  Legislatures will be enlarged  to  the extentindicated  in  Appendix III.   The allocation of seats and  method of election for  the  Provincial Legislative  Assemblies   (Lower Houses)is in accordance with the provisions contained in what is generallyi-preferred to as His Majes(y&apos;s Governmenfs Communal Award of the4th August  last (Cmd.  4147/1932).  The only modifications madeare the adaptation of the figures  necessary  in view of the subsequentdecision to establish Orissa as a separate Province,  and an alteration in respect of  the representation of the Depressed  Classes made in thecircumstances  explained below.    This   Award  was  given by  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in order  to remove  the obstacle  to  further progress in  the framing of a  Constitution  which was presented bythe failure of communities  in  India themselves  to  reach agreement on  the  subject  of   the method  and   quota of representation ofcommunities  in  the Provincial Legislatures.    His majesty&quot;s  Government in the Award pledged themselves notto vary their recommendations  to Parliament on  this subject  savewith the mutual agreement of the communities  affected,  and them-selves to take no part in  any negotiations initiated by the communitieswith a  view  to  revision of  their  decision.   One such variation hasbeen  made,   namely,   in  respect to  the  arrangements  for  the representation of  the Depressed  Classes which  have  been modified in  accordance with  an  agreement, now known  as  the Poona Pact,reached cn the  24th Seplember last between representatives of the hindu community and of the Depressed Classes.    His majesty&apos;s Government stated in  their Award that modificationof the communal electoral arrangements  might be made after 10 years with the assent of the  communities affected, for the  ascertainmentof which suitable means would have to be devised.    The members-s  of  the Provincial Legislatures will be in all  caseselected, and no official will be eligible for  election.  In three Provinces*the Legislature  will be bi-cameral :^ in  the remainder  it will consistof  a  single  Chamber.   But provision  is  made  in  the  Proposals(paragraph 74)  whereby, subject to  restriction,  an Upper Chamberwhere it exists may be abolished, or created where  it does not exist.The powers  of  provincial Upper  Chambers will not be  co-extensivewith those of the Lower Chamber, but will  extend onhy  to revisionand delay.                     The Provincial Franchise.    50.  Details of the franchise proposed in the case  of the variousProvincial  Legislatures  are given in Appendix V.   Here,  as in the              *  Bengal, tho  United Provinces and  Bihar.
 case  of  the  franchise  for  the Federal  Legislature,  it should  be emphasised that pending the  preparation  of  an electoral  roll the qualifications  proposed are inevitably to some extent stated in general terms and that modifications  of  detail may be found  necessary  on various points once the preparation of the  roll is undertaken.  The franchise in question is essentially based  on property,  supplemented by an educational  qualification common  to men and women  alike; by a  qualification  for  women in respect  of property  held  by  a husband; by  provision directed to  secure an electorate of 10 per cent. of  the population   of  the Scheduled Castes9  (hitherto known  as Depressed Classes)  in each province, except  in  Bihar  and Orissa where the general percentage of enfranchisement is in the neighbour- hood  of  9 per cent, only, and in the North West Frontier  Province and Sind, where the numbers of the Scheduled Castes are negligible; and by provision of a special electorate for  the seats proposed to be reserved  for  the &quot;representation  of  Commerce,  Labour and  other special interests.  Registration of  claimants in respect  of an education- tional qualification or of a woman qualified in respect of.her hnsband&apos;s property will,  at any rate for the first two  elections, be on application by the potential voter only.    51.   A precise statement of the numerical  effect  of the  electoral qualifications  proposed cannot be  given pending the preparation of a provisional electoral roll.  So far as can be judged, however, these proposals,  if   accepted,  would,  in  the  typical  case  of   Bengal, enfranchise some   7^-  millions,   or   some  15  per  cent,  out  of a  total  population  of  50 millions.   In  the  ease   of   Bombay the percentage to be enfranchised would  probably be rather higher than  in  Bengal; in Madras and  the  United  Provinces it would  be approximately  the  same;  in  all  other  provinces it would  be substantially lower, the lowest figure being reached in the case of Bihar and Orissa,  with an electorate of some  Si  millions or rather over  9 per cent,  of  the total population.   The general  effect  of acceptance of  the proposals in question for British India as  a  whole would be an electorate in the  neighbourhood  of 14  per cent, of the total  population, or  some  27 per cent, of  the  adult population.    A separate franchise  will be devised for the two new provinces of Sind  and Orissa.   In the case  of  Sind the franchise in  question will probably  be substantially  identical in general character  (subject to  allowance  for certain  differences  in local conditions) with that proposed for Bombay.  The new province  of Orissa would be formed by accretions  from  the Central Provinces and Madras,  as  well  as from  the present  province of Bihar and Orissa,   and while  the franchise will probably  generally  resemble  that proposed for  Bihar and Orissa, modifications of greater or  lesser importance  may  in consequence be necessary in this case.      RELATIONS BETWEEN THE  FEDERATION AND  THE  UNITS.          Powers of Federal and Provincial Legislatures.    52.   The  conception  of  Federation and  of  that consequential change in provincial  status commonly denoted  by  the expression &quot;Provincial autonomy&quot; will necessitate a complete  departure from the existing system  of concurrent  jurisdictions that is  to say,  there will be a statutory  demarcation between  the  legislative competence of the Federal and Provincial  Legislatures  respectively,  and the assignment to each of an exclusive field  of competence which the other will not be permitted, save  to  the  extent indicated below,  to invade.    58.   Following  the practice of other  Federal  constitutions, therespective legislative fields of the Centre and of the Provinces will be defined in terms of subjects which will be  scheduled to  the Constitu-tion Act.  But while it will be possible to assign to the Federation andto the Provinces respectively a number of matters over which  theycan appropriately bo charged  with exclusive legislative  jurisdiction,examination has shown that this method cannot without inconveniencebe so  employed as to exhaust the entire field of potential governmentalactivity and that there are some matters  in respect of  which,  while   * Tho  Castos in oach  Provineo scheduled as requiring special  electoralprotection are oiuimoratod in Appendix VIII.
some  measure of uniformity of law  may  be necessary, variation of detail  to  meet  the  local conditions of  the Provinces  is  no  lessnecessary.   It will  consequently  be  necessary  to schedule certainsubjects whereon both Federal and Provincial Legislatures will enjoyconcurrent powers,  the exact nature and effects of which will beseen from paras. Ill, 112 and .114 of the  Proposals.   Illustrative lists of the exclusively Federal, exclusively  Provincial,and &quot; concurrent &quot; subjects, which do not purport, to be complete orfinal,  are appended.  (Appendix VI.)   54. Certain  matters  will  be placed outside  the   competencealtogether  of both  Federal  and Provincial  Legislatures,  namely,legislation   affecting   the Sovereign or  the  Royal Family,  the sovereignty or dominion of the Crown over any part of British India,the law of  British nationality, and the Army Act, the Air Force Actand  the Naval  Discipline Act and  the Constitution Act  itself.   Asregards the Army, Air Force and Naval Discipline Acts,  the IndianLegislatures will be  debarred  from legislating in such a  way as tointerfere with the operation of these Acts in so  far as they operate in India,  while  at  the  same time  it  is intended  to  preserve theexisting powers* of the  Central Legislature in  India to  extend theprovisions  of these Acts with or without modification to members of forces raised in India.  Apart from a complete exclusion  of juris-diction in  regard  to  these matters it is proposed to place upon thecompetence of the new  Legislatures a limitation,  taking  the  formfamiliarised  by  the  provisions  of  the existing  Act,  whereby theGovernor-6eneral&apos;s in some cases the Governors previous sanction to the introduction  of certain specified classes  of measures will berequired.   The  proposed  classification for this purpose will be foundset out in  paragraphs 119  and  120 of the Proposals.   It will, ofcourse, be made  clear  (paragraph  121)  that  the  grant by theGovernor-General or by a Governor of his prior consent to the intro-duction of  a measure under this Proposal is  not to be taken asfettering  his  judgment,  when the  time  comes,  if the  measure  is passed, for his  decision as to the grant or withholding of his  assentor  the reservation  of  the  measure  for the  signification  of His]\fajesfy&apos;s  pleasure.    One further specific limitation on the powers of the  Legislaturewhich has  already been mentioned in paragraph 29 should be referredto again  in the present context, namely,   the  provisions  proposedwhich  will  render  ultra  vires  certain forms of  discriminatorylegislation.    55.  The  administrative relations between the  Federal Govern-ments and the Units are dealt with in  paragraphs 126-180  of theProposals.   Provision  is made  in  para.  126 of the Proposals forsecuring not only that due effect is given  within the Provinces to acts of the Federal  Legislature  which apply  to  them, but also that theProvincial  Governments  shall give  effect   to  directions issued bythe Federal Government in relation to any  matter  which affects theadministration  of a  Federal subject  in the executive sphere  of theProvince.   The latter  provision will  cover all  classes   of Federalsubjects, including those administered by  the Reserved Departments.In the latter class of subjects, the directions will, of course, be issuedby the Governor-General.   Allocation of Revemies between the Federation and the Units.    56.  It is intended  that the division of resources  between the Federation and the Units should be  in accordance with the following scheme.   The method of treatment  of taxes on income,  which is of special importance,  is  described separately below.   The lists that follow are  not  intended to be exhaustive,  but  to indicate only the more important heads.   (For fuller lists,  see Legislative Schedules in Appendix VI.)   *  As provided in  section 177 of tho Army  Act, section 177 of tho Air Force Act, and  as regards tho Naval Discipline Act, in section 06  of tho Government of India Act.

This limitation  is to  prevent  theimposition of some unspecified  new tax, which  might directly  conflict withFederal taxation.    57.  Taxes on income will be dealt with as follows:     Corporation tax* will be entirely federal.  Federating States will contribute under this  head after 10 years.   All legislation regardingtaxes on income will be federal (subject to the right mentioned belowof Provincial Legislatures to impose Provincial surcharges).  receipts from such taxation on officers in Federal service, and tax attributable to Chief Commissioners&apos; Provinces or other Federal areas, will accrue to Federal Revenues.   The net proceeds  of the remainder of taxeson income,  other than that from  the federal  surcharges mentionedbelow,  will  be divided between the Federation and the  Governors&apos;Provinces,  x per  cent, being assigned  to  the  former,  and  theremainder to the latter.  Before a final recommendation can be madeas to  the  basis of distribution of the Provincial share  between  theProvinces  (and the basis on which tax will be attributable to ChiefCommissioners&apos;  Provinces),  it will be necessary to complete furthertechnical investigation which is now proceeding.  It is intended thatpercentage x should be between 25 per cent, and 50 per cent.    Federal legislation regulating taxes on income which affects bothProvincial Revenues as well as Federal Revenues is to be introduced by leave  of  the  Governor-General   given  in  his discretion after consulting the Federal Ministry and Provincial Ministries.    The  Federal  Legislature  will also  be  empowered  to  imposesurcharges on taxes on income, the proceeds of which will be retained by the Federation.  Federating States will contribute  to  the FederalRevenues a proportionate amount.   If, however, at the time when  the Constitution comes into force the special surcharges  on taxes on income imposed in September 1981are still in operation,  these will be deemed to be Federal surchargesbut  without  liability on  federating States to  make any equivalentcontribution.   The Provincial Legislatures will be  empowered to impose, by theirown legislation,  surcharges on taxes on personal income of residents   *  There  is at present in forco  in British India a  super-tax  on  profits of companies, which is usually roforrod to ns Corporation tax.
                                                            \ in the Province,  the net proceeds going to the Provinces.   Collection would bo carried  out by Federal agency.  It is intended that an upper limit for such surcharges should be imposed, fixed at 12^ per cent, of the rates of taxes on income in force at any time, exclusive of  federal surcharges.    58.  It is anticipated that in the  early years of the Federation, before there has been  time to develop new  sources of taxation (in particular  Federal excises),  the above system of  distribution  is likely to leave  the  Federation with  inadequate resources.   It  is accordingly intended to adopt a transitory provision  by  which  the Federation can retain for itself a block amount out of the proceeds of income-tax distributable to the  Provinces.  This  amount  would  be unchanged for three years, and would diminish annually over  the next  seven years, so as to  be extinguished at the end of  ten years. This  amount would be fixed after the  investigation mentioned below.   Power will be given  to the Governor-General in his discretion, but after consultation with the Governments concerned, to suspend  the programme of reduction  if in  his opinion  its continuance  for  the time  being would endanger the  financial stability and credit  of the Federation.   59.   It is also anticipated  that certain Provinces will be in deficit under the proposed scheme.  The North-West Frontier Province will (as now) require  a contribution from the Centre in view of its  special position.  The new provinces of  Sind  and Orissa will not  be able to start   as  entirely  self-supporting  units.   Some  of  the  existing Provinces,  notably Assam, are likely to need assistance at  least for a time.  It is intended that these Provinces should receive subventions from  Federal Revenues.  These subventions may be either permanent or terminable after a period of years.   60.   It will be necessary at as late a  stage as possible  before the new Constitution actually comes into operation to review in the lightof the then financial  and economic conditions the probable financial position of both Federation and the Provinces.   The Government of India  and  Provincial  Governments  will,  of  course,  be   closely associated with any enquiry for this purpose.   It is only in the light of such review that it will  be possible to settle such matters  as theamounts and periods of the  Provincial  subventions, the percentage of taxes on income  to be permanently allocated  to the Centre, and the amount to be  retained by the  Federation  temporarily out  of thenormal Provincial  share of  taxes  on  income.   It  is accordingly proposed that the determination of such matters should be by  Orders in Council, the drafts of which would be laid before both  Houses ofParliament for approval.   Attention may be drawn  in  this  connection to the observationsalready made at  the end  of paragraph 82.   61.  The introduction  of  any scheme  of Federal Finance  is complicated by  the existence of &quot; contributions&quot; paid by  certainIndian States to  the Crown,  and by  &apos;&apos; immunities&apos;&apos; which many  ofthe States  enjoy in respect of certain heads of prospective FederalRevenue as,  for  example,  sea customs,  salt,  posts  and telegraphs.A full description of the very complex position will be found  in theReport  of  the  Indian  States  Enquiry  Committee  (Financial),Cmd. 4108/32.   It is proposed that  the Crown should transfer the &quot;contributions,&quot; so long as these arfe received, to Federal  Revenues.The  intention is  that these  &apos;&apos; contributions&apos;&apos;  should  be abolished bya process of gradual reduction pari passu with the gradual reductionof the block  amount retained by the Federation out of the share  of provincial Income Tax  described in paragraph 57 above.   Abolition cannot, however, be  effected by a uniform  process.  The positionof each State requires separate treatment depending on the existence of &apos;&apos; immunities,&apos;&apos; since it is  not intended to remit &apos;&apos; contributions &apos;&apos; save  in so far as they are in  excess  of a  still existing  immunity. Provision for the treatment of  &apos;&apos; contributions&apos;&apos; on these  lines will be made  in  the States&apos;  Instruments  of Accession.   It  is  further proposed, as  more fully explained in  the  Indian  States  Enquiry Committee  Report,  that  as   a counterpart  to   the  remission  of
&apos;&apos; contributions,&apos;&apos;  credit should  be given  to  certain  States  whichceded  territory  to  the  Crown  under  circumstances  somewhatanalogous to those in which other States agreed to pay &quot;contributions-tions,&quot;  the basis  of  determining the  amount  of such credits beingthe net revenues of the territories at the time  of cession.   Provisionfor such credits will  have to be made in the Constitution  Act.   Itmay be necessary to establish a Tribunal or other machinery for  thepurpose  of  determining the value of  immunities  (especially thosesubject to considerable fluctuations), where these have to be assessedfrom  time  to  time  for the  purpose  of  setting them  off  against &quot;contributions,&quot;   or   against  any  payments  accruing  from   theFederation.                         THE JUDICATURE.                        The Federal Court.    62.   In a Constitution created  by  the federation of  a number of separate political units and providing for the  distribution of powersbetween  a  Central  Legislature and Executive  on the one hand  andthe Legislatures and  Executives  of the federal units on the other, a federal  Court has always been  recognised as an essential  element.Such a Court is, in particular, needed  to interpret authoritatively  theFederal  Constitution  itself.    The  ultimate  decision  on  questions concerning  the  respective spheres of  the Federal, Provincial  and state authorities is also most  conveniently  entrusted to a  Tribunalindependent of Central, Provincial  and State Governments, and sucha  Tribunal  will,  in any event, be required  in order to prevent  themischief which might otherwise arise if the various  High Courts and state Courts interpreted the Constitution in different senses,  and thusmade the law uncertain and  ambiguous.    68.   It  is proposed that the  Federal  Court should have both  anoriginal  and an appellate  jurisdiction.   Its original jurisdiction willbe to determine justiciable disputes between the Federation and anyFederal  unit or between  any two  or  more Federal units, involving the interpretation of the Constitution Act or any rights or obligationsarising  thereunder.  Its  appellate jurisdiction  will  extend to  the determination of appeals  from any High Court or State Court  on questions, between whomsoever they may arise, involving the inter-pretation of the Constitution Act or any rights or obligations arisingthereunder.  In  order  to guard  against frivolous  and  vexatiousappeals,  it is proposed that, unless the value  of the subject matter in dispute  exceeds a  specified sum, an appeal  will  only lie  with  theleave of  the Federal Court or of  the High Court or State Court  eon-cerned.  It  is proposed that an appeal shall lie  without leave to  theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council from a  decision of the FederalCourt in any  matter  involving  the  interpretation of  the Consti-tution,  and in any other  case only by leave  of the Federal  Court,unless His  Majesty in Council grants special leave  to appeal.  As a corollary no appeal will be allowed against any decision of a  HighCourt direct to  the King  in  Council  in  any  case  where under  theConstitution an appeal lies to the Federal Court.    64.   On the analogy of the jurisdiction conferred on the JudicialCommittee  of  the Privy Council, by  Section 4  of  the JudicialCommittee  Act, 1888, the Governor-General  will be empowered inhis discretion to refer to the Federal Court any  justiciable matter onwhich it is, in his opinion,  expedient to obtain the opinion of  theCourt.    65.   The Federal Court will consist of a Chief Justice and  a specified number of Judges, who  will be appointed by the Crown andwill hold office during good behaviour.  But power will  be  taken toincrease  this number if both Houses  of  the Legislature present  an address to the  Governor-General praying that His  Majesty may  be[(leased to  do so.                       The Supreme  Court.    66.   But though a Federal Court with power and jurisdiction, suchas those indicated, is a necessary  and integral part of the Constitutionenvisaged by these proposals, Indian opinion is  far from unanimous
   as to the necessity or at all events as  to the immediate  necessity .   for a  Supreme Court of Appeal.   The  jurisdiction of such a Court,   were it established,  would necessarily  be limited  to  British India,   and its functions would  be, within the limits assigned to it, to  act   as a  final Court  of Appeal  in  India  from the  decisions  of  the   Provincial High Courts on matters other  than those mainly consti-   tutional which will  fall within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.   With  such a  Court  in existence,  there  would  be good  reason  for   limiting  the   right  of  appeal from Indian High  Courts  to  the   Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and  thereby mitigating some   of the  grounds  for  dissatisfaction which arise from  the  delays,   expense and  inconveniences  necessarily involved in  the  prosecution   of appeals before so  distant a tribunal.   On the other hand, there is   strong support for the  view  that  a Supreme Court for India would   be an  unnecessary and  unjustifiable expense, and that it  would be   difficult to find, in addition to the Judges required for the Federal   Court  and the  Provincial High   Courts, a  body  of  judicial  talent   of the calibre essential if  it  is  to justify  its  existence:  there is,   moreover,  difference  of opinion   as  to whether such  a  Court,  if   established, should be separate from the Federal Court or should be   constituted as a Division of that Court.   In  these circumstances His   Majesty&apos;s  Government  are of opinion  that  the right course is  to   empower the  Federal Legislature  to set up such a Court if and when   there  is sufficient unanimity of view on these and other questions to   enable legislation  for this  purpose to be promoted,  but  that  the   powers  and jurisdiction  of the Court should none the less  be  laid   down by the  Constitution  Act on the  lines  indicated in paragraphs   164-108 of the Proposals.                  THE SECRETARY OF STATE&apos;S ADVISERS.      67.  His  Majesty&apos;!  Government do not regard a  Council of the   kind which has been associated with the Secretary  of State for India   since  the Crown took over the affairs of the  East India Company in   1858 as any  longer necessary in, or appropriate to, the conditions   of  the  new  Constitution.    They  are  satisfied,   however,   that   the responsibilities of the Secretary of  State will remain such  as to   make it imperative that he should have at his disposal a small body   of carefully selected advisers  to supplement  the assistance which in   common with other Ministers he will derive from the permanent  staff   of his Department.      68.  &quot; The  Secretary  of  State in  Council  of  India&quot;  as  a   statutory  corporation  which  alone can  be  plaintiff  and  defendant   in  any  litigation instituted  by,  or  against,  any Governmental   authority in  India,  and  in   whose name  alone  can  be  executed   any contract or assurance entered into  by any Government in India,   is a conception which is manifestly incompatible  alike  with Provincial   self-government and with a  responsible Federal  Government:  and   the present power of veto possessed by the Council of India over all   expenditure from  the revenues of India is no less incompatible  with   the constitutional  arrangements outlined in paragraphs 5  to 11 of this   Introduction.  The Proposals, therefore, contemplate the vesting in   the Federal Government and the Provincial Governments respectively   of all  property held in the name  of the Crown  which is  required for   their respective purposes, and these authorities will be endowed with   the  right to enter into all contracts  and assurances  necessary   for  the performance  of  their  functions,  with  the  right to  sue   and the  liability to  be  sued  in\ respect  of  any  claims arising   in their several spheres of authority.   It will  at  the same time be   necessary to preserve the existing rights of suit against the Secretary   of State  in   this  country in  respect of any claims arising out of   obligations undertaken by the Secretary of  State  in  Council before,   and subsisting at the  date of, the inauguration of the Federation,    and to place  upon the Federal Government an obligation to implement    any judgment or award arising therefrom, whether by the provision   of funds or otherwise.       69.  As  regards the Secretary of State&apos;s Council, it is proposed    to enable him to appoint not less than three nor more than  six    advisers (at  least two of whom must have served the Crown in  India
for not less than 10 years) to hold office for five years.  The Secretaryof State will be free to consult these advisers, either individually orcollectively, as he may think fit.   But he will be required not onlyto consult them, but to obtain the concurrence of  a majority of them on  the  draft  of  any  Rules  regulating   the Public   services in India, and in the disposal of any appeal to him permitted by theConstitution from  any member of those  Services (see paragraph 180of Proposals).   70.   The main divisions of the Public Services in India are:        (1) The All-India Services;       (2) The Provincial Services; and       (8) The Central Services, Classes I and II.   Officers&quot; of the All-India Services serve  chiefly in  the Provinces,but they are liable to serve anywhere in India,  and a number of thehigher posts  under the  Government  of India are  held by them.These All-India Services include the following :      (i) The Indian Civil Service;    (ii) The  Indian  Police;   (iii) The Indian Forest Service; and    (iv) The Indian Service of Engineers.   On the transfer of their fields  of service to Ministerial control onthe inauguration of the new Constitution, recruitment will cease  forNos. (iii) and (iv).   The Provincial Services cover  the whole field of civil administra-tion  of the Provinces in the middle and  lower  grades.  Members ofthese services are appointed by the Provincial Governments.Some of the more important of the Central Services are:        (1) The Railway Services;       (2) The Indian Posts and Telegraph Traffic Sendee;       (3) The Imperial Customs Service.Persons appointed by the  Secretory of State in Council are serving inall these Services.   71.   All persons appointed by the Secretary of State in  council have  certain  important  rights.   They  cannot,  for example,  be dismissed from the  Service  by  any  authority subordinate to theSecretary of State in Council; their pay is protected from the vote ofthe Legislatures; and they have an ultimate right of appeal to theSecretary of  State  in Council  against  all  important  disciplinarymeasures taken  in  India  and also in  respect  of  their principalconditions of service.   It is intended to safeguard these rights and  to extend them  to allpersons appointed by the  Secretary of State after  the commencementof the  Constitution Act  with  the exception  of the right to  retireunder  the regulations  for premature  retirement;  this right  it isproposed to  give only to officers appointed to the Indian Civil Serviceand  Indian  Police  during the first five years  after the date of federation.   Certain members of the Provincial  and Central Services though they may not have  been appointed by  the Secretary of State inCouncil have also rights for the preservation of which he is responsible.These, too,  will be secured.   72.   Provision  is  made   for  continued  recruitment  by theSecretary of  State to the Indian  Civil Service,  the  Indian Police,the Ecclesiastical Department, and such appointments to the superiorMedical and Eailway Services as may from time  to time be authorizedby Order in Council.   Provision is also made for securing  that all  persons appointed bythe  Secretary of State  in Council or the  Secretary of  State areemployed in India  on work of the kind for which their recruitmenthas been considered essential.   At the  expiry  of five years  from the commencement  of theConstitution Act  a statutory enquiry will be held into the question ofTHE PUBLIC SERVICES.
future recruitment for the Indian Civil Service, Indian Police and theMedical and Railway Services and the governments in India will be associated  with the enquiry.  The decision  on the  results of theenquiry will rest with His Majesty&apos;s Government and will be subjectto the approval of both Houses of Parliament. Pending the decisionon this enquiry, the present ratio of  British to Indian recruitmentwill remain unaltered.   78.  As regards Family Pension Funds to which serving officersnow  contribute, His Majesty&apos;s  Government consider  that it  must berecognised  that assets constitute  in all cases  a definite debt liability of the Government of India and  are the property of  the  subscribers.In  these   circumstances  they  are examining  a  proposal  for theadoption of a new financial procedure in  relation to these funds, witha view to building up gradually  separate  sterling  funds.  If such ascheme should  prove to be practicable, it will, of course, be necessaryto consult  members of the Services regarding it before any decision is reached.  The  adoption  of  any   such scheme would  probablynecessitate certain  statutory provisions  not  covered  by the  present proposals.   His  Majesty&apos;s   Government  propose  to  submit  their recommendations on this subject  to Parliament at a later date.                  The  Statutory Railway  Board.   74.  There  is one matter of importance which these Proposals donot cover,  namely,  the  arrangements to  be made for the  administra-tion of the Railways under the Federal Government.   His Majesty&apos;sGoveimment consider that  it  will  be essential  that,  while the-Federal Government  and  Legislature  will  necessarily  exercise  ageneral control  over railway policy,  the   actual  control  of theadministration  of  the  State Railways  in  India  (including  thoseworked by  Companies) should be placed  in the hands of  a  StatutoryBody, so composed  and with such powers as will ensure that it is in aposition to perform  its  duties upon business  principles, and  without being subject to  political interference.  They consider further that,after  meeting from  railway receipts the necessary working expenses and  interest charges, the surplus funds  derived  from  this  sourceshould be  disposed of by  agreement between this  Body  and theFederal Government, the agreement at its inception being based uponthe existing convention as approved by the Indian Legislature, which provides for the allocation of surplus railway revenues.  With such a statutory  Body in existence, it  would be  necessary  to preserve theexisting right  which the Indian  Railway  Companies  possess underthe terms of their contracts to have access to the Secretary of state in regain-d  to disputed points  and  to matters which  may be  made thesubject of  arbitration.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government are in consulta-tion  with the Government of India on the questions of principle anddetail which require settlement before a satisfactory  scheme can be devised to  carry out these purposes.                       Fundamental Rights.   75.  The question of including in the Constitution Act a seriesof declarations, commonly described as a statement of &quot; fundamentalrights,&quot; which would be designed to secure either  to the community in general, or to specified sections of  it, rights  or immunities towhich importance is attached,  has been much discussed during theproceedings of  the Round Table Conference.   His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment see  serious objections to  giving  statutory expression to any large range of declarations of  this character, but  they are satisfiedthat  certain provisions of this   kind,  such, for  instance,  as the respect due to  personal liberty and rights of  property  and theeligibility of all  for public office, regardless  of differences of caste,religion, &amp;c,  can  appropriately,  and should,  find  a place in theConstitution Act.                            Conclusion.   70.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are fully aware that the actualdrafting of the Constitution Bill, and the consequent repeal of theexisting  Government  of India Act,   will  raise  a  number  of  other
questions some of importance which these Proposals do not cover,for instance, provision will be  required for an Auditor-General, forthe establishment of the  Secretary  of  State and for  various othermatters which the existing Act  at present embraces, and which may,or may not, require perpetuation in the Act which takes its place.                            Burma.   77.  It has not  been  possible to include in  the Proposals  anyrelating to Burma, as Burma has,  as  yet, made no choice betweenthe alternatives of separation  from India, with a Constitution as outlined in Command Paper 4004/1932, or inclusion as a  GovernorsProvince in the Federation of India.
MOST  SECRET.Copy  No.                     THE PROPOSALS.                             PART I.                      THE FEDERATION.                            GENERAL.    1.   There  will  be first  a declaration  to  the  effect  that  allpowers  appertaining  or  incidental  to  the  government  of Indiaand all  rights,  authority and jurisdiction possessed in that country whether flowing from  IDs Majesty&apos;s sovereignty over the territories of British India, or derived from  treaty,  grant,  usage, sufferanoe orotherwise  in relation to other territories are vested in the  crown and are exer-cisable by and in the name of the King Emperor.                [See paragraph 9 of Introduction.]    2.   The  Federation  of  India  will  be  a  union  between  the governors&apos;  Provinces and those Indian States whose rulers signifytheir  desire to accede to  the Federation  by  a formal Instrument of accession.   By this Instrument the Euler will transfer to the Crownfor the purposes of the  Federation his  powers and jurisdiction inrespect  of those matters  which he is willing to  recognise as federalmatters; and the powers and jurisdiction so transferred will thereafter be exercised on behalf of  the Federation  and in  accordance  with theprovisions  of the  Constitution Act  by the  Governor-General, theFederal Legislature, the Federal Court (with an appeal  therefrom toPlis Majesty  in Council) and such other  Federal organs as theConstitution Act may  create.   But in the case of  every State whichaccedes, the powers and jurisdiction of the Federation in relation tothat State and the subjects of  its  Ruler will be strictly  co-terminouswith  the powers and  jurisdiction  transferred  to the Crown by the ruler himself and defined m his Instrument of Accession.    3.   Except to  the  extent  to  which  the  Ruler  of  a State hastransferred  powers and jurisdiction, whether by his Instrument of accession or otherwise and, in the case of a  State which has notacceded to the  Federation, in all respects the relations of  the state will be with the Crown represented by the Viceroy, and  not  with theCrown represented  by  the Governor-General  as executive head of theFederal Government.  Accordingly, all powers  of the  Crown inrelation to the States which are at present exercised by the Governor-General in  Council, other than those which fall within the Federalsphere,  will after  Federation  be   exercised  by  the  Viceroy as theCrown&apos;s representative.    5.  The Federation will  be brought into existence by the issueof  a  Proclamation by  His  Majesty  declaring  that  on   a date to be  appointed in the Proclamation the  existing nine &quot; Governors&apos;Provinces,&quot; with Sind and  Orissa  (which will be constituted as new and separate Governors&apos; Provinces), are to be united in a Federationof India with such Indian States  as have acceded or may accede tothe Federation; but the Proclamation will not be issued until     (a) His Majesty has received intimation that the rulers of States         representing  not  less than half the aggregate population         of the Indian  States and entitled to not less than half         the seats to be  allotted  to the  States in  the  Federal         Legislature, have  signified their desire to accede to the         Federation;  and
    (I) Both  Houses  of  Parliament have  presented  an  Address to          His Majesty  praying that such a Proclamation  may be          issued.    5.  The authority of the Federation  will, without  prejudice tothe  extra-territorial   powers  of  the  Federal   Legislature   (seeparagraph  111),  extend  to the Governors&apos;  Provinces,  to the accedingStates (subject to the. limitations mentioned  in paragraph 8), and tothose  areas  in   British India  which  are  administered by  ChiefCommissioners namely,  the Provinces of  Delhi,  Ajmer-Merwara,Coorg, British Baluchistan  and the Andaman and Nicobar  Islands.These  Provinces  (with one  exception) will  be directly subject to thejurisdiction of the Federal Government and Legislature.    In  the  case  of  British Baluchistan  special  provision  will bemade whereby the Governor-General will  himself direct  and control the  administration  of  this  Province   (see  paragraphs  57-58).Expenditure  required for British Baluchistan will  not be subject tothe vote  of the Federal Legislature, but will  be open  to discussion in both Chambers.    The authority of the Federation will not extend  to the Settlementof Aden.   Proposals will shortly be put forward, for the administrativeseparation  of this area from India.                    THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE.    6.  The executive authority of the  Federation,  including- thesupreme  command of  the  Military, Naval and  Air Forces in india will be exercisable  on the  King&apos;s behalf by  a  Governor-Generalholding office  during His  Majesty&apos;s pleasure, but His Majesty  willbe empowered to appoint a  Commander-in-Chief to exercise in relationto  those  Forces  such powers and functions  as  may  be assigned to him.    All executive acts will run in the name of the Governor-General.                       St    7.  The executive authority of the  Federation  will  extend inrelation to a  State-member of the Federation only to such  powersand jurisdiction falling within the  Federal sphere as  the Ruler hastransferred to the King.    8.  The Governor-General will exercise the powers conferred upon him by the Constitution Act as executive  head of the Federation andsuch powers of His  Majesty (not being powers inconsistent with theprovisions of the  Constitution  Act) as His Majesty may be pleased byLetters Patent constituting the office of Governor-General  to, assignto him.  In exercising all these powers the Governor-General will actin accordance  with an Instrument of Instructions to be issued to  himby  the King.    9.  The draft of the Governor-General&apos;s Instrument of Instruc-tions (including the drafts of any  amendments thereto) will  be  laidbefore both Houses  of Parliament, and opportunity will be providedfor each House of Parliament  to make to His Majesty7 representationsfor an amendment or addition to, or omission from, the Instructions.    10.  The Governor-GeneraUs salary will be fixed by the Constitu-tion Act, and all other payments in  respect of his personal allowances,or of salaries and allowances of his  personal and secretarial  staff, willbe fixed by Order in Council;  none of these payments will be subjectto the vote of the Legislature.            THE  WORKING OV THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE.   11.   The Governor-General  will himself direct  and control theadministration  of certain Departments of State namely,  Defence,External Affairs  and  Ecclesiastical Affairs.
   12.  In  the  administration of these Reserved  Departments, theGovernor-General will be assisted by not more than three Counsellors,who  will be appointed by the Governor-General, and  whose salaries and conditions of service will be prescribed by Order in Council.   13.  For the purpose of aiding and advising the Governor-general in the exercise of powers conferred upon him by the Constitution Actfor the  government of the Federation, other  than powers connectedwith the matters  mentioned in paragraph 11, and matters  left bylaw  to  his  discretion, there will  be  a  Council  of Ministers.   TheMinisters will be chosen and summoned by the Governor-General andsworn as  Members of the Council  and  will  hold office during hispleasure.   The  persons appointed  Ministers  must be,  or  becomewithin a stated  period,  members of one or  other Chamber of theFederal Legislature.   14.  In  his Instrument of Instructions the  Governor-general will  be  enjoined inter alia  to use his best endeavours to select his ministers  in the following manner, that is, in consultation with theperson  who, in his  judgment, is likely  to command  the  largestfollowing  in the Legislature, to appoint those persons (including sofar as  possible members of  important minority  communities  and representatives of  the States-members of  the Federation) who  willbest  be in a position collectively to command the confidence of theLegislature.   15.  The number of Ministers  and the amounts of their respec-tive salaries will be regulated by Act of the Federal Legislature, but,until the Federal Legislature otherwise determines, their number andtheir  salaries will be  such as  the  Governor-General  determines,subject to limits to be laid down in  the Constitution Act.   The salary of  a Minister will not be  subject to variation during his term of office.   16.  The Governor-General will,  whenever he thinks fit, presideat meetings of his Council of Ministers.   He will also be authorised,after consultation  with  his Ministers, to  make in his discretion anyrules which he regards as requisite to regulate the disposal of Govern-ment  business and the  procedure to  be observed in its conduct, andfor the transmission to himself and to his  Counsellors in the ReservedDepartments, and to  the Financial Adviser, of all such  informationas he  may direct.   17.  The Governor-General will be empowered, in his discretion,but after consultation  with  his  Ministers,  to  appoint  a financial adviser to assist him in the discharge of his &apos;&apos; special responsibility &apos;&apos;for financial  matters see  next  paragraph and  also  to   adviseMinisters on matters regarding which they may seek his advice.  TheFinancial  Adviser will  be  responsible to the Governor-General andwill hold office during his pleasure;  his salary will be fixed by theGovernor-General and  will   not   be  subject  to the  vote  of theLegislature.   18.  Apart from  his  exclusive  responsibility  for  the  ReservedDepartments (paragraph 11) the Governor-General in  administering the  government  of  the  Federation  will  be  declared  to have  a&apos;&apos; special responsibility &apos;&apos; in respect of    (a) the prevention of any  grave menace to the peace or  tran-          quillity of India or any part thereof;   (b) the safeguarding of the financial stability  and  credit of the          Federation;   ic) the safeguarding of the legitimate interests of minorities;
    (d) the securing to the members  of the Public Services of any          rights provided for them by the  Constitution Act and the          safeguarding of their legitimate interests;    (e) the prevention of commercial discrimination;    i/) the protection of the rights of  any Indian State;    (g) any matter which affects the  administration  of any Depart-          ment under  the  direction  and control  of  the  Governor-          General.It will be for  the  Governor-General  to determine in  his  discretionwhether  any-  of  the &apos;&apos; special  responsibilities&apos;&apos;  here  described are involved by any given circumstances.    19.   If in  any case in  which, in the opinion of the Governor-General, a special  responsibility is imposed upon  him it appears tohim, after considering  such  advice  as has been given him by his ministers, that the due discharge of  his  responsibility so requires,he  will have full discretion to act as  he  thinks fit, but in  so actinghe  will be guided by any directions which may  be contained in hisInstrument of  Instructions.    20.   The  Governor-General, in  administering the Departmentsunder his own direction and control, in taking action for the dischargeof any special  responsibility-, and in exercising any discretion vested in him by the Constitution Act, will be required to  give effect to such directions, if any, not being directions inconsistent with anything inhis Instructions,  as may  be given to him by a principal  Secretaryof State.    21.   The  Governor-General&apos;s Instrument of  Instructions will accordingly contain inter alia provision on  the following lines:        &apos;&apos; In matters  arising  in the Departments  which you  direct    and  control  on  your  own  responsibility,  or in  matters the    determination  of which is  by law committed to your discretion,    it is  Our  will and  pleasure  that  you should act in exercise of    the powers by  law  conferred upon you in such  manner as you    may  judge  right and  expedient for the good government of the    Federation, subject, however, to such  directions as you may from    time  to time  receive  from  one  of Our principal Secretaries of    State.       In matters  arising  out  of the  exercise- of powers  conferred    upon you for  the purposes of the  government  of the Federation    other  than those  specified  in  the preceding  paragraph it  is    Our  will  and  pleasure  that you should,  in the  exercise of    the powers by law conferred upon you, be guided  by  the advice    of your Ministers, unless so to be guided would, in your judgment,    be inconsistent with the  fulfilment of your special responsibility    for any of the matters in respect of which a special responsibility    is by law committed  to  you; in which case it is  Our  will, and    pleasure that  you should, notwithstanding your Ministers&apos;  advice,    act in exercise of the powers by law conferred upon yrou in such    manner as you judge  requisite for the  fulfilment of your  special    responsibilities, subject, however,  to such  directions as you may    from time to  time receive  from one of Our principal Secretaries    of State.&quot;                    THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURE.                             General,    22.   The   Federal   Legislature^  will  consist  of  the   King,represented by the Governor-General,  and  two  Chambers, to be styledthe  Council of  State  and  the House  of  Assembly,  and  will be summoned to  meet for the  first time not later than a date  to be specified in the Proclamation establishing the Federation.

Power to  summon,  and appoint places  for  the meeting of,the  Chambers,  to  prorogue  them,   and  to  dissolve  them,  eitherseparately or simultaneously, will be vested in the Governor-General
at his discretion, subject to the requirement that they shall meet atleast once in every year and that not more than  twelve months shallintervene between the  end  of one session  and  the commencementof the next.   The  Governor-General will also  be empowered to summon theChambers for the purpose of addressing  them.   2$.   Each Council of State will continue for seven  years and eachAssembly for five yeai-s, unless sooner dissolved.   25.   A member of the Council  of Ministers will have the right to speak, but not to vote, in the Chamber of  which  he is not a Member.   A Counsellor will  be ex officio  an additional member of bothChambers for all purposes except the  right of voting.                The Composition of the Chambers.   26.

The Governor-General will be  empowered at his discretion,but  subject to the provisions of the Constitution  Act  and  to  hisInstrument of Instructions, to  assent in His  Majesty&apos;s name  to  aBill  which has been  passed by both Chambers, or to  withhold his assent,  or to reserve the  Bill  for the signification of the  King&apos;pleasure.  He will also be empowered, if  he thinks fit, before taking any  of these courses,  to remit a Bill to the Chambers with a Messagerequesting its reconsideration in whole or  in part,  together with suchamendments,  if any, as he  may recommend.   No Bill will  become  law until it has bean agreed to by  bothChambers either  without amendment or with such amendments only as are agreed to by both Chambers, and has been assented to by theGovernor-General,  or,  in  the  case of  a reserved Bill,  until HisMajesty  in Council has signified his assent.    40.   Any  Act assented  to by the Governor-General will withintwelve months be subject to disallowance  by the King in Council.    41.   In the  case of  disagreement between the Chambers,  theGovernor-General will  be empowered,  in any case in  which a bill passed by one Chamber has  not, within three months thereafter, been passed  by the  other,  either without  amendments or with  agreedamendments, to summon the two Chambers to meet in a joint sittingfor  the  purpose  of reaching a decision on the Bill.  The memberspresent  at a Joint Session will deliberate  and vote together upon theBill in  the form in  which it finally  left the Chamber in which  it was introduced and upon amendments, if any, made therein by one Chamber  and not  agreed to by the  other.   Any such amendments which are affirmed by a majority of the total number of membersvoting at the Joint Session  will be deemed to have been carried, and if the Bill, with the amendments, if any, so carried, is affirmed by a majority of the  members voting at  the Joint Session,  it  shall be taken to have been duly passed by both Chambers.    In the case of a Money  Bill or where  a decision on a Bill  cannot, in the  Governor-GeneraPs  opinion, be delayed without prejudice  to the public interest, he will be empowered at his discretion to summon a Joint Session at any time without  waiting  for the  expiiy of the normal  period of three months indicated  above.     42.   In order  to  enable  tho Governor-General  to fulfil the responsibilities imposed upon him personally for the administration of the Reserved Departments  and his &quot; special responsibilities,&quot; he will be  empowered at his discretion      (a) bo present,  or cause to be presented, a Bill to either Chamber,           and to declare by Message to both Chambers that it  is           essential,  having regard  to   his  responsibilities  for  a           Reserved  Department  or, as the  case  may  be, to any  of           his &quot; special responsibilities,&quot;  that  the  Bill  so presented           should become law before  a date specified in the Message;           and
    (b) to declare by Message in respect of any Bill already introduced          in either Chamber that it should for similar reasons become          law before a stated date in a form specified in the Message.    A Bill which is the subject  of such  a Message  will  then beconsidered or reconsidered by the Chambers, as  the case may require,and if, before the date specified, it is not passed  by the two Chambers,or  is not passed  by the two  Chambers in the  form  specified,  theGovernor-General will be empowered  at his discretion  to  enact it asa Governor-Generabs Act,  either with or  without any amendmentsmade by either Chamber after  receipt of his Message.    A Governor-General&apos;s  Act  so  enacted will  have the same forceand effect as  an Act  of  the  Legislature,  and  will  be  subject todisallowance in  the  same manner,  but  the  Governor-GeneraFscompetence to  legislate  under  this provision will not extend beyondthe  competence  of  the  Federal  Legislature   as  defined  by  theConstitution.    43.   It will  be made clear by means of the enacting  words of  a governor-General&apos;s  Act,  which  will  be   distinguished  from  theenacting words of an ordinary  Act  (see paragraph 22), that Acts ofthe former  description  are enacted on  the  Governor-General&apos;s own responsibility.    44.   Provision  will  also  be made  empowering  the  Governor-General  in his discretion,  in any case in which  he considers that  aBill introduced, or proposed for introduction, or  any7 clause thereof,or  any  amendment to  a Bill  moved or proposed,  would affect  thedischarge of his  &quot; special  responsibility &quot; for the prevention  of anygrave menace to  the peace or tranquillity of India, to direct that theBill, clause or amendment  shall not  be further proceeded with.

It will be for  the Governor  to determine in his discretion whether any of the *&apos; special responsibilities &quot; here described are involved  byany given  circumstances.    71.   If in any  case in which,  in the opinion of  the Governor, aspecial responsibility is imposed  upon him,  it appears to  him, after considering such advice  as has been given to him by his Ministers,that the  due discharge of his  responsibility  so requires,  he  willhave full discretion to act as he thinks fit, but in so acting he willbe  guided by  any directions  which may  be contained in his Instru-ment of  Instructions or which may be given him by the Governor-General  or by a  principal  Secretary  of State.

Legislative Procedure.NOTE. The  following paragraphs relating  to  legislative  procedure       are, with the exception of paragraph  92, framed, for the sake       of  brevity, to apply  to  unicameral  Provincial  Legislatures.       Suitable modification &quot;of  these  provisions,  for  the  purpose of       adapting them to Legislatures which  are bicameral  would,       of  course, be  made.   In particular,  provision will be made       that in a bicameral Legislature, Bills  (other than Money Bills,       which will be initiated  in the Legislative  Assembly)  will be       introduced in either Chamber.   89.  The Governor will be empowered at his discretion, but subjectto the provisions of the Constitution Act and  to  his Instrument of instructions, to assent in His Majesty&apos;s name to a Bill which has been passed by the Provincial Legislature, or to withhold his assent,  or to
reserve the Bill for the  consideration of the Governor-General.  Hewill also be empowered, if  he thinks fit, before taking any of these courses, to remit a Bill to the Legislature, with a Message requestingits  reconsideration in whole or in part, together with such amend-ments,  if  any, as he may recommend.    No Bill will become law  unless it  has been passed by the Legisla-ture, with or  without amendment, and has been assented  to by theGovernor, or in cases where the Constitution Act so provides, by theGovernor-General; in the case of a Bill reserved for the considerationof  the  Governor-General,  the Bill will  not  become law  until theGovernor-General  (or,  if the Governor-General reserves  the  Bill,His Majesty in Council)  has signified his assent.    90.  When a Bill is  reserved by a Governor for the considerationof the Governor-General, the  Governor-General will be empowered  athis discretion, but subject to the provisions of the Constitution Actand to  his  Instrument  of Instructions, to assent in His  Majesty&apos;s Name  to  the  Bill, or  to  withhold  his  assent,  or to reserve theBill for the signification of the King&apos;s pleasure.   He  will also beempowered, if he thinks fit,  before  taking any of  these courses,  toreturn  the  Bill  to  the  Governor  with directions  that  it shall be remitted to the Legislature  with  a  Message to  the  effect indicated  inthe preceding paragraph.  The Legislature will then reconsider theBill and if it  is again passed with or without  amendment  it will be presented again to  the Governor-General for his consideration.    If at the end  of six months  from the date on which a Bill was presented to  the  Governor-General,  the  Governor-General  neitherassents to it  nor reserves  it for the  signification  of  the  King&apos;pleasure,  nor  returns it to  the Governor, the  Bill will lapse.    91.  Any  Act  assented  to by the Governor or by the Governor-General will within twelve months be subject to disallowance by theKing in Council.    92.  In the case of  a Province having a Legislative Council,  ifa  Bill, which has been passed by the Legislative  Assembly,  is rejected by the  Legislative Council, or  is passed by that council with amendments to which  the Legislative Assembly will not agree,and if the Bill is,  after the expiry of two years from the date  uponwhich it  was  last under consideration by the Legislative Council,re-introduced  in the  Legislative  Assembly, and the Assembly againpasses it  in that form and the Legislative Council again refuses  topass it, or passes  it only with amendments to  which the LegislativeAssembly  will not agree, the Governor will be empowered to summon a Joint Session  of both Chambers  for the purpose of  reaching adecision on the Bill.  The  members  present at a  Joint Session willdeliberate and vote together  upon the Bill in  the form  in which  itfinally left the Chamber in which it was introduced and upon amend-ments,  if  any, made  therein  by one  Chamber  and not agreed to bythe other.  Any such amendments which are affirmed by a majorityof the total number of the members  voting at  the  Joint Session willbe deemed to have been carried, and if the Bill, with the amendments,if any, so  carried, is affirmed by a majority of the members voting  atthe Joint  Session, it shall be taken to have been duly passed by bothChambers.    In the case of a Money Bill, or in cases where, in the Governorsopinion, a decision on the Bill cannot, consistently with the fulfilment of any of his &quot; special responsibilities,&quot; be deferred, the Governor willbe empowered at his discretion to summon a Joint  Session forthwith.    93.  In order  to enable the Governor to discharge the &apos;&apos; special responsibilities&quot;  imposed upon him, he  will  be empowered at his discretion     (a) to  present,  or  cause  to be  presented, a Bill to the Legisla-          ture, with a Message that it is  essential, having  regard to          any  of  his &quot;special responsibilities&quot;  that any Bill ao          presented should become law before a date specified in the          Message;  and     [8174-2]
    (6) to declare by Message in respect of any !3ill already introduced          in  the Legislature that it should,  -for  similar  reasons,          become law before a stated date in a form specified in the          Message.    If, before the date specified, a Bill  which is  the subject of  such a Message  is not passed,  or is not passed in the form specified, as the case may be, the Governor will be empowered at his discretion to enact it as a Governor&apos;s Act, either with or without  any amendments made by the Chamber, or either of  the Chambers, after receipt of his Message.    A Governors Act so enacted will  have the  same force and effect as an Act of the Provincial  Legislature and will be  subject  to the same requirements in respect of the  Governor-General&apos;s assent  and to disallowance  in the  same  manner as an Act of  the Provincial. Legislature, but the Governors competence to legislate under  this provision will  not  extend  beyond the competence of  the Provincial Legislature  as defined by the Constitution.    94.  It will be made clear by the enacting words of a Governors Act,  which will be distinguished  from  the enacting words  of an ordinary Act (see paragraph 74), that Acts of the former description are enacted on the Governors own responsibility.    95.  Provision will also  be made empowering the Governor, in any case in  which he considers that a Bill introduced or proposed for introduction, or any clause thereof,  or  any amendment to  a  Bill moved or proposed, would  affect  the  discharge  of  his  &quot; special responsibility&apos;&apos;  for the  prevention of any grave menace to the peace or tranquillity of the Province, to direct that the Bill, clause or amendment shall not be further proceeded with.          Procedure with  regard  to  Financial  Proposals.    96.  A recommendation of the Governor  will be  required for  any proposal in the Provincial Legislature for the imposition of taxation, for the appropriation of public revenues, or any proposal affecting the public debt of the Province or affecting  or  imposing any charge upon  public revenues.*    97.  The  Governor  will  cause  a statement of  the estimated revenues and expenditure of  the Province, together with a statementof proposals for  the appropriation  of those  revenues,  to be  laid in respect of every financial year before the Provincial Legislature, and, where  the  Legislature  consists  of  two Chambers,  before both Chambers.    The statement of proposals for appropriation will be so arranged as     (a) to distinguish between those proposals which will, and those          which will not (see paragraph 99),  be submitted to  the vote          of the Legislature  and  amongst the  latter  to distinguish          those which are in the nature of standing charges;  and    (h) to specify separately those  additional  proposals (if  any),          whether under the votable or non-votable Heads, which the          Governor regards  as necessary for the fulfilment of  any          of his &quot; special  responsibilities.&quot;    98. The proposals for  the appropriation  of revenues, other thanproposals  relating  to  the  Heads  of Expenditure  enumerated  inparagraph  99  and proposals  (if  any)  made  by the  Governor indischarge of his special responsibilities, will be submitted, in the formof Demands  for  Grants, to  the vote of the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly will be empowered to assent,  or refuse assent, to  any demand or to reduce the amount specified therein,  whether by wayof a general reduction  of the  total amount of the  Demand or of  thereduction  or omission of any specific item or  items included in it.    99. The proposals for appropriation of  revenues,  if  they  relateto the Heads of Expenditure  enumerated in  this paragraph  will  not          *  Compare paragraph 45 and the footnote thereto.
be submitted to the vote of the Legislative  Assembly, but will beopen to discussion in the Assembly.

At the  conclusion of  the  budget proceedings the Governorwill authenticate  by his  signature  all  appropriations,  whether votedor those relating  to  matters   enumerated  in  paragraph 99;  theappropriations so authenticated will be laid before the Legislature,but will not be open to  discussion.   In  the  appropriations so  authenticated  the Governor  will  beempowered  to include  any additional  amounts which he regards as necessary for the discharge of  any of  his special responsibilities, so,

The Governor  will be empowered  at  his  discretion, if atany time he  is satisfied that a situation has  arisen  which renders it for  the time being impossible for  the government  of  the Provinceto be  carried on  in  accordance with  the other provisions  of  theConstitution  Act,  by Proclamation  to assume  to  himself all such powers vested by law in any Provincial authority as appear  to himto be necessary  for the purpose of securing  that the government ofthe  Province shall be carried on effectively.   A Proclamation so issued will have the same force and effect asan  Act  of  Parliament;  will  be  communicated forthwith  to  theGovernor-General  and  to  a Secretary  of  State   and  laid  beforeParliament;  will cease to operate at the expiry  of six months unlessbefore the expiry of that period it has been approved by  resolutions of both Houses of Parliament;  and may at any time be  revoked byResolutions of both Houses  of Parliament.                         Excluded Areas.   106.   His Majesty  will  be  empowered  to direct  by  Order inCouncil that any  area  within a Province  is  to  be an  &quot; excluded area&quot; or a  &quot;Partially Excluded Area,&quot; and by subsequent orders in Council to revoke or vary any such Order.   107.   In respect of Partially Excluded Areas the Governor willbe declared to have a special responsibility (see paragraph 70).   The Governor  will himself direct and control the administrationof any area in a Province for the time being declared to be an excluded area.   108.  Legislation  required,  whether  for  Excluded  Areas  orPartially  Excluded   Areas,   will  be  obtained  in  the  followingmanner :    No Act of the Federal Legislature  or  of  the Provincial Legisla-ture will apply to such an area unless the  Governor in his discretionso directs, and in  giving such  a  direction  the Governor will  beempowered to direct  that the Act, in its application to the area, orto any specified part  thereof,  is  to  have  effect  subject  to  such exceptions or modifications  as he thinks fit.   The Governor will also be empowered at  his discretion  to make regulations for the  peace and good government of any area  whichis for the time being an Excluded Area or a Partially  Excluded area and  will be competent by any Regulation so made to repeal or amendany  Act of the Federal Legislature or of  the Provincial Legislaturewhich is, for the time being, applicable to the area in question.   Regulations made under this provision will be  submitted  forth-with  to the Governor-General and will not have effect until he hasassented to  them;  but, when assented to by the Governor-General,will  have the  same  force and effect as an  Act of  the Legislaturemade applicable to the area by  direction  of  the Governor,  and willbe subject to disallowance in the same manner as a Provincial Act.but  will not be subject to repeal or amendment by any Act of theProvincial or of the  Federal  Legislature.    109. Rules made by  the Governor in connexion with legislativeprocedure will contain a provision prohibiting the discussion in theProvincial Legislature of, or the asking of questions on, any matterarising out of the administration of an Excluded Area, and  enabling the Governor, at his discretion, to disallow any resolution or questionregarding the administration of a Partially Excluded Area.
                            PART III.   RELATIONS BETWEEN  THE FEDERATION  AND  THE                       FEDERAL UNITS.   POWERS OK  THE  FEDERAL  LEGISLATURE  AND OF  PROVINCIAL                          LEGISLATURES.   110.   Il will be outside the competence of the Federal and of theProvincial  Legislatures  to make any law affecting  the Sovereign orthe Royal  Family, the sovereignty or dominion of the  Crown  over any  part of British India,  the law  of British nationality, the army act, the Air Force Act, the Naval  Discipline Act and the Constitu-tion Act (except, in the case of the last mentioned Act,  in so far asthat Act itself provides otherwise).   111.   The Federal Legislature  will have an exclusive power tomake laws for the peace and  good government of the Federation orany  part thereof with respect  to the matters set  out in Appendix VI,List I.*   Laws so made  will be  operative  throughout British India, but inthe States  which have acceded  to the Federation only  in so far as the ruler of the State has by7 his Instrument  of Accession accepted thesubject  with  which  the  law  is  concerned  as  a  Federal  subject.Federal  laws  will  be  applicable  to British subjects and  servants of the Crown within any  part of  India  and to all  Indian  subjects of His Majesty outside India.  The Federal  Legislature will also beempowered to make  laws  regulating the discipline  of His Majesty&apos;sIndian Forces, in so far as they are not subject to the Army Act, theAir Force  Act, or  the Naval Discipline Act, which will be applicableto those Forces  wherever  they are  serving.   112.   A Provincial Legislature  will have an exclusive power tomake laws for the  peace and good government of the Province or anypart thereof with respect  to  the matters  set out  in Appendix VI.List II.   113.   Nothing in paragraph 111 or 112 will  operate to debar theFederal Legislature,  in legislating for an exclusively7  federal subject,from devolving upon  a Provincial Government or upon any  officer ofthat Government,  the exercise on behalf of the  Federal  Governmentof any functions in relation to that subject, t   114.   The Federal Legislature  and  the  Provincial  Legislatureswill  have  concurrent  powers to  make  laws  with  respect  to thematters set out in Appendix VI, List III, but laws made by provincial legislatures under these powers will be confined in  their operation tothe territories of the Province.  The intention  of providing for thisconcurrent field  is to secure, in respect of the subjects entered in the list referred to in this paragraph, the greatest measure of uniformity7which  may7 be found practicable, but at  the  same  time to enableProvincial  Legislatures to make  laws to  meet local conditions.   The legislative field covered by the subjects contained in  List iii will  be the same for both Federal and Provincial Legislatures, exceptthat the Federal  Legislature  will  not in respect  of these  mattersbe able to legislate in such a  way as to  impose financial obligationson the  Provinces.   In the  event of a conflict between a Federal  law and a Provinciallaw in the concurrent field, the Federal  law  will prevail, unless theProvincial  law was reserved for,  and has received,  the assent of theGovernor-General.   The Federal  Legislature will have no  power to repeal or amend a Provincial law  to which  the Governor-General hasthus assented, save with the prior sanction of the Governor-General.   *  NOTE. Tho lists contained in this Appendix nro illustrative only, and do not purport to bo either exhaustive or final in their allocations.   t NOTE. Any  cost  which falls   in  virtue of  this  provision ou anyProvincial Government, and  which  that  Government would not otherwisehavo incurred,  will be  borne by  tho  Federal Govornuiont.   In tho event ofdisngroomont as to tho amount or incidence of any chargos so involved thequestion will be referred for decision (which will be final) of an arbitrator tobe appointed by tho Chiof Justice of the Federal Court.
    115.  It is  intended  that  the three  lists of subjects indicated in Appendix  VI  shall be  as  exhaustive  as  is reasonably  possible. But  it has  been found  on  examination  that  it  is not  possible to enumerate every subject of a  local and private character with regard to  which  the  legislative  power can  appropriately  rest  with  the Provinces  only.   It  is  accordingly proposed  to&quot; include  in  the Provincial List  a general power to legislate  on  any matter  of a merely local and private nature in  the Province;  but in order to provide for the possibility  that a subject which is in its inception of a merely  local  or  private character may subsequently become of all-India interest, it is proposed to make that power subject to a right of the Governor-General to sanction general legislation by the Federal Legislature on  the  same subject-matter, provided the  subject-matter is not specified in the Provincial List.  Provision will  also be made enabling either the  Federal Legislature or any Provincial Legislature to make a law  with respect to a residual  subject, if any, not falling within the scope of  any of the three lists,  by means of  an Act to the introduction  of which the previous sanction of  the Governor-General, given at his discretion, has been obtained, and to which (in the case of a Provincial  Act)  the  assent  of the  Governor-General  has  been declared.    116.  The Federal Legislature will be  empowered,  at the request of two or more  Provinces, to pass a law  which will be operative in those Provinces  and in any other Province which may subsequently adopt it on  a subject which  would otherwise fall within  the  legisla- tive  competence of a  Province only.  Such a Federal Act will be subject, as  regards  any Province to  which it  applies,  to subsequent amendment  or repeal by the  Legislature of  that  Province.    117.  If  any provision of  a law of a State is in conflict with an Act  of the  Federal Legislature   regulating any  subject which  the Ruler of that State-has by his Instrument of Accession  accepted as a Federal subject, the Act of the  Federal Legislature, whether passed before or after the making of  the law of  the  State, will  prevail.    118.  In order to minimise uncertainty of law  and opportunities for litigation as  to   the  validity  of  Acts, provision will  be  made limiting  the  period  within  which  an  Act may  be  called  into question on the ground that exclusive pow-ers to pass such legislation were  vested  in  a   Legislature  in  India other than  that  which enacted it.    119.  The  consent  of  the   Governor-General,  given at  bis discretion,  will  be  required  to  the introduction in  the  Federal Legislature of legislation which  repeals or amends or is repugnant to  any  Act  of  Parliament  extending   to  British India,  or  any Governor-GeneraPsu or  Governors Act  or Ordinance,9  [or Bengal Regulation III of 1818, or  Madras Regulation II of 1819, or Bombay Regulation XXV of 1827 ;]t or which affects any Department reserved for the control of the Governor-General,  or the coinage  and currency of the Federation, or the powers and duties of the Federal Reserve Bank in relation to the  management of currency and  exchange, or religion or  religious rites  and,usages, or the procedure regulating criminal proceedings against European British subjects.    120.   The consent of the Governor-General given in  his discretion will  be required to the introduction in  a Provincial Legislature of legislation  on such  of the  matters enumerated in the preceding   *  A Governor-Genoral&apos;s or Governors Ordinance for the  purpose of  this paragraph  moans an Ordinance as described  in paragraphs 53 and 103.   t An alternative method of dealing with these  Regulations  would be to insort  a separate provision,  to  form part  of the paragraph which  will probably bo necessary  in relation to  tho continuance of existing laws, to the following effect:  Bengal Regulation III of  1818, or Madras Regulation II of 1819, or Bombay Regulation  XXV of 1827  will  continue in force unless and until ropoaled or amended  by the Federal Legislature, or, iu relationto a  particular Province, by tho Legislature of  that Province.  But the introduction  of  a Bill  for this  purpose  in  any Legislature  will  require tho provious  sanction of  tho  Governor-Gonoral,  and  a Provincial  Bill for the purpose will bo reservod for  the Govornor-GeneraPs assent.
 paragraph as are  within the competence of  a  Provincial Legislature, other  than legislation  which repeals, amends or  is repugnant to a Governors Act or Ordinance&apos;; or which affects religion or religious rites  and  usages.  The introduction  in a  Provincial  Legislature of legislation on  these  latter subjects will require  the  consent of the Governor of the Province  given in  his  discretion.    121.  The  giving of  consent by  the Governor-General or  any Governor  to the introduction  of a  Bill will be without prejudice to his power of withholding  his  assent  to, or  of  reserving, the  Bill when  passed;  but an  Act will not be invalid by reason only that prior consent to its introduction was not given, provided that it was duly assented to either by-  His Majesty, or by the Governor-General or Governor, as the case may be.    122.  The  Federal  Legislature  and the Provincial  Legislatures will have  no power  to make  laws  subjecting  in  British India  any British subject  (including  companies,  partnerships or associations constituted by or under any Federal  or Provincial law), in respect of taxation,  the holding  of property,  the  carrying on  of any pro- fession, trade,  business or  occupation, or  the  employment of  any servants or agents, or in respect of  residence or travel within the boundaries of  the Federation, to  any disability or  discrimination based  upon his religion, descent, caste,  colour or place of birth;  but no  law will be deemed to  be discriminatory for this purpose on the ground only that  it  prohibits  either  absolutely7  or  with exceptions the sale or mortgage of agricultural land in any area  to any person not belonging to some class  recognised as  being  a class of  persons engaged in,  or  connected with, agriculture in that area, or which recognises the existence of some right,  privilege or disability attaching to the members of a  community by virtue  of  some privilege, law or custom having the  force of  law.    A Federal or Provincial law, however, which  might otherwise be void on the ground  of its  discriminatory character will be  valid if previously declared by  the  Governor-General or a Governor, as the case may  be, in his discretion, to be necessary in the interests of the peace  and tranquillity of India or any part  thereof.    123.   The Federal  Legislature  and the Provincial  Legislatures will have  no power  to make  laws subjecting  any British subject domiciled   in  the  United  Kingdom   (including  companies,   &amp;c. incorporated or constituted by  or  under  the laws  of the United Kingdom) to any disability or discrimination  in the exercise of certain specified rights, if an Indian subject of His Majesty, or a company, &amp;c, constituted  by  or under  a  Federal  or  Provincial   law,  as  the case may  be,  would not  in the exercise  in the  United Kingdom of the  corresponding  right be subject in the United Kingdom to any disability  or discrimination of the same  or a similar character.   The rights  in  question  are  the  right to enter,  travel and  reside in any part of British  India;  to hold property of any kind;  to carry  on any trade  or business in, or  with the inhabitants of, British India; and to appoint and employ at discretion agents and servants  for anyof the  above purposes.    Provision will  he made  on the  same lines  for equal treatment on a reciprocal basis  of ships registered  respectively in  British  India and the United  Kingdom.             \    124.   An  Act  of the  Federal  or  of  a Provincial  Legislature, however,  which,  with  a  view to  the  encouragement  of trade  or industry,  authorises  the  payment  of grants,  bounties  or subsidiesout  of  public funds  will not  be held  to fall within  the terms of the  two preceding paragraphs  by  reason only of the  fact  that it is limited  to  persons  or  companies  resident  or incorporated  in India,   or  that  it  imposes  on persons or  companies  not  trading in India before the Act was passed as  a  condition of eligibility for   * This  relates only  to an  Ordinance  ol&apos; the kind described in  para-graph 103.
any  such  grant,  bounty  or  subsidy  that  a  company  shall  be incorporated  by or  under the  laws  of  British  India,  or that the composition of the Board  of  Directors shall  be such, or that such facilities shall be given for training Indian subjects of His Majesty,as the Governor-General may consider satisfactory.   125.  Unless  an agreement for the  recognition on a reciprocalbasis of Indian medical qualification is for the  time being in existenceunder  the  Medical  Act,  1886, medical  practitioners  registered inthe United Kingdom will be entitled to practise or to be registered inIndia without the necessity of obtaining  further qualifications.   ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT                          AND THE UNITS.                   Relations with  the Provinces.    126.  It will  be the  duty of a  Provincial  Government  so  toexercise its  executive power and authority, in so far as it is necessary and applicable for the purpose, as to secure  that due effect is given within  the  Province to every  Act  of the  Federal Legislature which applies  to that Province:  and the authority  of the Federal Govern-ment will extend to the giving of  directions to a Provincial Govern-ment to that  end.    The authority of the Federal Government will also extend to the giving of directions to a Provincial Government as  to the mannerin which the latter&apos;s executive  power and authority shall be exercised in  relation  to any matter  which affects the administration of a federal subject.    127.  The Governor-General  will be empowered at his discretion to issue instructions to the Governor of any Province as to the mannerin which  the  executive, power and authority in that Province is tobe exercised for the purpose of preventing any grave menace to thepeace and tranquillity of India  or any part thereof.        Relations with the States-Members of the  Federation.    128.   It will be the duty of  the Ruler of a State to secure thatdue  effect is  given  within  the territor3r  of his  State to  every act of the Federal Legislature which applies  to that  territory.    129.   The Governor-General will be empowered and, if the termsof any State&apos;s Instrument of Accession so provides, will be requiredto make agreements with the Ruler of  any State  for the carrying outin that State,  through the agency of State  authorities, of any Federalpurpose.  But it will  be  a condition of every such agreement thatthe Governor-General  shall  be entitled, by inspection or otherwise,to satisfy himself  that an  adequate standard  of administration  ismaintained.    130.   The Federal  Government  will   be empowered to  issuegeneral  instructions to  the Government of any State-member  of theFederation for the  purpose of  ensuring that  the Federal  obligations of that  State are duly fulfilled.                FINANCIAL POWERS  AND RELATIONS.                  Property, Contracts and Suits.   131.   All legal proceedings which may  be at present instituted byor against the  Secretary of  State  in  Council will, subject to the reservations specified below, be instituted  by  or against the federal government or the Government of a Governors Province as the case may be.   132.  All property in India which  immediately before the dateof the establishment of  the Federation was vested in His Majesty
                                                                     Proposals.                for the purposes of the government  of  India  will continue to be                vested in His Majesty, but for the respective purposes of the Federal                Government and the Governments of Governors&apos; Provinces, and will,                subject to any special provisions  which may be made in  relation to                Railways, be allocated between the  Federal and Provincial  Govern-                ments accordingly.  Property vested in His Majesty for purposes of                the  government  of  India which  are   outside  the  Federal  and                Provincial  spheres will not be affected by this allocation.                   Appropriate provision will also be made with regard to property -                outside India vested in His Majesty  for the purposes of  the govern-                ment of India.                   133.  Existing powers  of the  Secretary of  State  in  Council  in                relation to property allocated  under the preceding paragraph and                in relation  to the acquisition of property and the making of contracts                for purposes of government which are not  outside the Federal and                Provincial  spheres will be  transferred  to  and become  powers of the                Governor-General of the  Federation  and  Governors of the Provinces                respectively.  All contracts, &amp;c,  made under the powers so trans-                ferred will  be expressed to be made  by the  Governor-General or the                Governor, as the case may be, and may be executed and made in                such manner and by such person as he may direct,  but  no personal                liability will be  incurred by any person  making or executing  such                a contract.                   134.  The Secretary of  State will be substituted for the Secretary                of State  in  Council  in  any  proceedings instituted  before  the                commencement of the Act by or against the Secretary  of State in                Council.                   135.  Eights and liabilities arising under any Statute or contract                in existence at  the commencement  of the  Act,  including  existing                immunities  from Indian  Income Tax  in  respect  of  interest on                sterling loans  issued  or  guaranteed byr  the Secretary of  State in                Council, will  be maintained and any  remedies which, but  for the                passing of  the  Act would have been enforceable by or  against the                Secretary of State in  Council, will after  the commencement of the                Act be enforceable by or against the Secretary of State;  and all                obligations  arising under  any such statute or contract which imposed                a liability7 on the revenues  of India will remain a liability on all the                revenues of India, whether Federal or  Provincial.                   136.  Money required  to meet  any  judgment or award given                against the Secretary of State will, in the first instance, be a charge                on the revenues of the Federation with the  right of  recovery by the                Federal  Government, where  necessary   and   appropriate,  from                Provincial revenues.   The Secretary of  State  will have power  to                secure the implementing  of any judgment or award obtained against                him.                                     Allocation of Revenues.                NOTE. Legislative powers in  relation to  taxation and  raising  of                      revenue  will  be  defined  by  the   legislative  schedules in                      Appendix YI (see in particular items 85-37 of Part A and                      50-54 of Part B of List I, and 67, with Annexure, of List II).                                              \             .   &apos;         :  :- .  .                   137.  Revenues derived from sources in respect  of  which the                Legislature of a Governors Province  has exclusive, or  concurrent,                power to make  laws will  be allocated as provincial revenues.                   Revenues derived  from sources in  respect of which the  Federal                Legislature has  exclusive power  to  make laws  will be allocated as                federal revenues; but in the cases  specified in the following  para-                graphs the Federation  will  be  empowered  or  required to  make                assignments to  Provinces or States from Federal revenues.Salt.               138.  The Federal Legislature  will be  empowered to assign  toFederal Excises.   Provinces and States in accordance with such schemes of distributionExport Duties,   as it may  determine the  whole  or any  part of the net  revenues                derived from any one  or more of the sources specified in the margin;                in the case, however, of export duties on jute or jute products, an

A prescribed percentage, not being less than 50  per  cent. &apos;I&apos;axes on incomenor more than 75 per cent., of the  net revenues derived  from the agriculturalsources specified in the margin  (exclusive of any surcharges imposed inC0me) except by the Provinces,  and of revenues derived  from taxes on the official taxes on the emoluments of Federal  officers or taxes on income attributable  to income or capitalChief Commissioners&apos;  Provinces  and other Federal areas) will be oE comPames-assigned on a prescribed basis  to the Governors&apos; Provinces.   Provision will be made enabling this arrangement to be extendednot less than ten  years  after the commencement of the Act to any state-Member of the Federation which has agreed  to accept federallegislation  regarding the taxes on income  referred to  in  the marginas applying to the State.   For each of the first three years  after  the commencement of theConstitution Act, however, the Federal Government will be entitled toretain in aid of federal revenues out of the moneys which would other-wise  be assigned  to the Provinces  (the amount distributed to theProvinces being correspondingly reduced) a sum to be prescribed andfor each of the next seven years a sum which is in any year less thanthat retained in the previous year by an amount equal to one-eighth ofthe  sum  originally  prescribed.   But the  Governor-General will  beempowered in  his discretion to suspend these  reductions  in wholeor in part, if after consulting the Federal  and Provincial Ministrieshe is of opinion  that  their  continuance for  the time being would endanger the financial  stability of the Federation.   141.  Legislation  concerning  any  of  the  forms  of  taxationmentioned in the three preceding paragraphs  which  directly affectsany  revenues assigned  to  the  Provinces  will require  the previousconsent of  the   Governor-General  given  in his discretion   afterconsultation with the Federal and Provincial Ministries.   142.  The  Federal   Legislature   will  have  power  to imposesurcharges for Federal purposes on taxes on income,  no part of the proceeds of which will be assigned to Governors&apos; Provinces  (or otherunits).   While such surcharges are in operation, each  State-Memberof the Federation (unless it has agreed to  accept Federal legislationregarding taxes on income as applying to the State) will contribute toFederal revenues  a  sum to  be  assessed on a prescribed basis.  ButStates will not be required to contribute any counterpart to the specialaddition to taxes on income imposed in September 1931, if and so longas those additions are still  being imposed;  though  the latter will inother respects be deemed to be Federal surcharges.    143.

By these means,  taken in  conjunction withthe provisions  proposed  tor the  Constitution Act in relation to theSecretary  of State, the Executive of the Central Government, thoughnecessarily deprived  of much  of  its present range  of  authority inthe Provinces,  would for  the  time being be  placed  in  substantially the same position as that occupied by the Governor-General in council under the existing Act.   * This paragraph should by read in relation  to paragraphs 12 and 13 ofthe Introduction.

It is accordingly not  possible to state with certainty how many Europeans and  Indians  respectively will be  returned   It is, however,expected that initially the numbers will bo approximately 6 Europeans and 5 Indians.    5  See paragraph 45 of Introduction.    II  It may be necessary to resort to nomination in the case of Baluchistan.
                                  PART  I.                     Provincial Legislative Assemblies.  (See paragraph 49 of Introduction and  paragraph  78 of  the  Proposals.)   1.   Seats in the Legislative  Assemblies in  the Governors&apos; Provinces  willbe allocated as shown  in the annexed table.   2.   Election  to the seats allotted to  Muhnmmadan, European  and  Sikhconstituencies  will be by  voters  voting in separate communal  electoratescovering  between  them the  whole  area of the  Province  (apart  from  anyportions which  may in special  cases  be  excluded from tho  electoral area as&quot; backward &quot;).   3.   All qualified electors,  who  arc not voters either in  a Muhammadan,Sikh,   Indian  Christian  (see paragraph 5  below),  Anglo-Indian  (see para-graph  G below)  or European constituency, will be entitled to vote in a generalconstituency.   4.   Seats will  be  reserved for  the Depressed  Classes  out of the generalseats  to the extent indicated in the table.  Election to these seats will bo byjoint  electorates,  in  plural  member  constituencies,  subject  to the  following procedure:  All members of the Depressed Classes registered in the generalelectoral  roll of a constituency  will form  an electoral  college which will  electa panel of four candidates belonging to tho Depressed  Classes for each of suchreserved seats by  the  method of the single vote, and the four persons getting the highest  number  of votes  in  such  primary  election shall  be  the  onlycandidates for election by the general electorate who are  qualified for thoreserved scats.   5.   Election  to the seats  allotted to Indian Christians will  be by votersvoting  in separate communal  electorates.   It   seems almost  certain  thatpractical  difficulties will, except possibly  in  Madras, prevent the formation ofIndian Christian constituencies covering the whole area of tho Province, andthat  accordingly  special  Indian  Christian  constituencies  will   have to be formed only in one or two selected areas  in the  Province.  Indian  Christianvoters in  these areas will not vote  in a general constituency.  Indian Christianvoters outside  these  areas  will  vote  in  a general  Constituency.   special arrangements may be needed in  Bihar, where a considerable proportion ofthe Indian Christian  community belong to the aboriginal tribes.   6.   Election  to the seats allotted to Anglo-Indians  will be by  voters voting in separate communal electorates.   It is intended, subject to  investigation ofany practical  difficulties that may arise, that the Anglo-Indian constituenciesshall  cover the  Whole area of each Province, a postal ballot being employed.   7.   The method of  filling  the seats assigned  for representatives  frombackward  areas is still  under  investigation,  and  the  number of seats soassigned  should be regarded  as provisional.   S.   The precise electoral machinery to be employed in the constituenciesfor the special  women&apos;s seats is still under consideration.   9.   The seats  allotted to  &quot;Labour&quot;  will be filled from non-communalconstituencies.  The electoral arrangements have still to be determined, butit is  likely that in most Provinces the  Labour constituencies will be partlytrade  union and partly special  constituencies..   10.  Tho special seats allotted to Commerce  and  Industry,  Mining andPlanting will be filled by election through Chambers of Commerce and variousAssociations.  The details of the electoral arrangements for these seats must await further investigation.   11.  The special seats allotted  to  Landholders will  be  filled by election by special Landholders&apos;  constituencies.   12.  The method to be employed for election to the University seats is still under consideration.                                  part  II.                      Provincial  Legislative Councils.   (See paragraph  49  of Introduction and paragraph  SO  of the Proposals.)   The Legislative Councils (Upper Chambers)  in  the Provinces of Bengal,United Provinces  and Bihar, will be constituted as follows:  Bengal. Total seats 65.   10 nominated by tho Governor in his discretion.   25 elected by  method  of  tho single transferable vote by  tho members of       tho Bengal  Legislative Assembly.   15 directly elected from constituencies for which  only Muslim voters will       be qualified.    3 directly elected from constituencies in which only European voters will       bo qualified.   12 directly  elected  from  goneral constituencies   in  which  all qualified       voters  other than Muslims  and  Europeans will be entitled to vote.

It is, accordingly, not possible in each Province to state with certainty how many Europeans and Indians respectively will be returned.  It Is,however, expected that, initially, tlie numbers will bo approximately as follows :-Madras, 4 Europeans, 2  Indians;  Bombay, 4 Europeans, 3 Indians; Bengal, 14 Europeans,5 Indians; United Provinces, 2 Europeans, 1 Indian;  Punjab, 1 Indian:  Bihar, 2 Europeans, 2 Indians;  Central Provinces (including Berar), 1 European, 1 Indian; Assam,8 Europeans, 3 Indians; Sind, 1 European, 1 Indian ; Orissa, 1 Indian.    (6) Seven of these seats will be reserved for Mahrattns.    (c) One of these seats iH a Tumandar&apos;a  seat.  The four Landholders&apos;  seats will ho tilled  from special constituencies with joint electorates,  U is  probable, from thedistribution of the electorate, that the members returned will be 1 Hindu, 1 Sikh and 2 Muhammadans.   id) This woman&apos;8 seat will Ins filled from a non-communal constituency at Shlllong.   \t) Sec paragraph 45 of Introduction.
APPENDICES IV AND V.                                 FRANCHISE.                             Introductory Note.    1.  The  qualifications  proposed  for  the  Franchise  for  the  Provincial Legislatures and for the seats  allotted to the provinces  of British India  in the  Federal House  of  Assembly are set out  in the Schedules  which follow. It should be  emphasised that the qualifications in question  are necessarily subject to modification  in details on  the  preparation of an electoral roll. -    2.  General  Qualifications. Apart   from  the  qualification  of   race, community, or religion, in the case of  certain seats, voters in respect of any of the qualifications shown  in these schedules must be British subjects,  must have attained the age  of 21  years,- and, save in the case of certain  special constituencies, must reside  in the constituency in which  they claim  to  vote.    3.  For the first  two elections under the new constitution, and thereafter unless and until a local Government modifies this requirement  in respect  of the area under its control,  claimants in  respect of an  educational qualifica- tion, or of property  held by a husband, will be required to make application to be entered on  the electoral roll  to the returning officer.    4.  The Scheduled Castes (Depressed  Classes). It is the intention of His Majcsty&apos;s Government  to make provision for the  inclusion on  the Electoral rolls for the Provincial Legislative Assemblies of approximately 10 per  cent. of the  population of  the Depressed Classes (whom it is proposed in future to designate Scheduled Castes) in all Provinces save  Bihar  and Orissa  (where the percentage will  be  in the neighbourhood of 7  per  cent.) and the  North- West Frontier Province and  Sind,  where the numbers  of  the Scheduled Castes are negligible.   In the case of the Federal  House of Assembly, the approximate general percentage aimed at is  2 per cent, (save in the case of Bihar  and  Orissa and  of  the North-AVest  Frontier  Province  and  Sind). Certain  provinces are  satisfied that  it will  be possible to  attain  these percentages under the  operation of the general franchise qualifications.  In certain other  provinces it appears open to question whether this will be the case, and, if on the  preparation of  the  Electoral Roll a  marked deficiency- is  found to exist,  special  steps to  make it up will  be called  for.  The differential  franchise   contemplated   in  such  circumstances   by  certain provinces is provisionally  included  in  the  Schedules which  follow.   The Scheduled Castes  are enumerated by Provinces in Appendix  VIII.    5.   The  Educational  Qualification.-Oivii\g to the marked differences in the educational system  in  different  provinces, and the  absence of  records which could be used to support a  claim  to  an  educational  qualification in certain cases,  it has  proved impossible  to lay down any common educational standard for the  provincial legislatures which woidd apply to  the whole of India, and in certain provinces it has been found necessary to fix a standard identical with  that  laid down  for  the  Federal House  of Assembly.  His majesty&apos;s Government,  in   accepting  in  these   circumstances  a   high educational  standard as an  electoral qualification for  certain provincial legislatures,  do so with the reservation  that  it shall be  open  to the Local Governments  concerned to  lower  it  once  the  administrative difficulties involved  are overcome.    6.  Sind  and Orissa. &quot;While it  has been  decided that Sind and  Orissa shall  be established as separate  provinces, the framing of  a detailed  scheme for the franchise for the Provincial  Legislative Assembly in  those provinces has not yet  been completed.  &quot;While the franchises in question will probably closely  resemble (allowance being made for  the special conditions of the  new provinces) those laid down  in the Schedules  which  follow for  Bombay  and Bihar and Orissa respectively, it has  been thought preferable  at the present stage to make  no specific provision for either Sind or Orissa in the Schedules.    7.   Special  Constituencies. In the  interest of  presenting  as complete  a picture as possible of  the franchise  qualifications  proposed,  the Schedules which follow set out in detail  the  existing  qualifications for   the various Special  Constituencies   (representing  Landholders,  Commerce,  Industry, Alining, Planting,  Universities) in each  province in the case of the Provincial and Federal Legislatures alike.  The  qualifications in question  should, how- over,  be  regarded  as provisional, pending the  closer investigation  of  the existing electorates for these seats whi^h  is contemplated at the  stago  of the general delimitation  of constituencies.  Pending further investigation at the same  stage no specific proposals are  included  in  the  Schedules in respect of tho seats now  for the first time assigned to  Labour in  the  Provincial  and Federal Legislatures  and to  Backward areas in certain provincial legislatures,or of  certain other constituencies to be brought into  being consequent on the Communal decision.   Nor  has  any  separate provision been  made for  thespecial  seats reserved for women.  Election to those seats  in the provincial legislatures  will be  on  the  basis of tho  general  franchise  qualifications:while election  in tho case of the Federal Lower House will bo  by membersof Provincial Legislatures.
