MEMORANDUM BY THE  MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.    1.  AT their meeting on Wednesday, the 14th December, 1932 (Cab. 67 (32)),the Cabinet agreed (Conclusion 6)         &quot; (a) Without committing the Cabinet at all on the question of principle.    that the Minister of Agriculture should be authorised  to prepare a Bill on    the lines of the draft heads attached to his memorandum (CP. 429 (32)) :    that is to say, making provision for the importation not of particular agri-    cultural products, but ad omnia.  The Cabinet after seeing the Bill  could    then decide whether the  provision should  be  ad omnia or  for specific    commodities.&quot;    2.  A draft Bill on the lines indicated in Appendix A to  CP. 429 (32) isnow attached.    3.  The provisions  of the Bill  have  been discussed between the Depart-ments concerned, viz., the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Board ofTrade, the Scottish Office and the Home Office (in regard to the provisions relatingto Northern Ireland).    4.  It provides       (i) (Clause 1) for the regulation of the importation of any agricultural          product into the United Kingdom by Order by the Board of Trade if          it appears                (a) that unless the Order is made the reorganisation contemplated          by an Agricultural Marketing Scheme for  the  time being in  force          cannot be achieved; or               (b) that the Order is necessary to meet an emergency affecting the          economic stability of any branch of the agricultural industry in the          United Kingdom.     (ii) (Clause 3)  for the regulation by Order of sales of  home-produced agri-          cultural products;    (iii) (Clause 4) for the appointment of a Market Supply Committee to advise          the agricultural Ministers in connection with the discharge of their          functions under the Act;    (iv) (Clause 5)  for the submission and approval of  agricultural development          schemes for the purpose of regulating the production of &quot; secondary &quot;          products such as bacon and hams;      (v) For certain minor amendments to the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931.    5.  In view of the terms of the Cabinet Conclusion quoted above, the Bill hasnot yet been referred to the Home  Affairs  Committee, but if, as I  trust, theCabinet now approve the principles involved, I should be glad to have authorityto submit the Bill immediately to the Home  Affairs Committee with  a view toits introduction, subject, of course, to any amendments which that Committee maycl6Sll*6                                               (Initialled)       W.
