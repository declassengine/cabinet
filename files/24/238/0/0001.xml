             This Document is the property of His britannic                          Majesty1 a &amp;/)vejrment.Bret                                           Cocy No. ... A4...I  31 (33)                             CABINET.                  Kenya:  Gold-mining in Native Reserves             Memonndum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.                  There was one question raised in the debate in        the House of Lords on which I should like to have a        Cabinet decision.                  The Archbishop of Canterbury asked for an        undertaking that no action should be taken on the Report        of the Carter Corrreission (the Land Carsmission which is        enquiring into the adequacy of the Native Reserves and        the working of the Lands Trust Ordinance) until        Parliament has considered the Report. . I think it would        be unwise and contrary to native interests to give so        comprehensive a pledge.  It would preclude us from        taking prompt action though everyone would agree that        such action&apos; should be taken.  For example the Comnission        will report on whet land should be added to the Reserves,        and where.  I know that Sir Morris Carter in private        talks with the Governor has indicated that the present        idea of the Cocraissicn is to reconsaend the addition of        a block of land (probably on lease)    the Kavirondo        Reserve, equivalent to the total area which they estimate        may be temporarily excised for mining purposes.  I think        it is obvious that the Government of Kenya ought not to        be precluded from taking prompt action to give effect to
a reconznenda t ion of that kind.  It  should also beremembered that the reference to the Carter Commissionto report on the working of the Native Lands TrustOrdinance is conditioned by the proviso &quot;without involving any departure from the principles of the ordinance&quot;.  In these circumstances I think that the answer ought to be as follows:-     (1) Parliament will certainly be given full opportunity of discussing the Carter Report:     (2) It would be unreasonable to say that no action of any kind should be taken in advance of a parliamentary debate, which might not be immediatelypossible.  For example it would clearly be undesirable to hold up all action in connection with any additions to the Reserves -hich the Carter Commission mayrecommend.  Again,  there may be small matters of administrative convenience which everyone would agreeshould be dealt with rapidly.     (3) I should draw attention to the provisogoverning the terms of reference in regard to theNative Lands Trust Ordinance,  but say that notwith-standing this,  if the Report recommends any changesin the provisions of the Land Trust   Ordinance these should not be carried into effect until parliament has had an opportunity of discussing the Report.         ?There is one other matter which was hardlyraised in the House of Commons,  but with which lord Hail sham dealt fully in the House of herds.   Onthe question of prospecting,  the Government of Kenyahas had the advice  of Sir Albert Kitson;  and theycould not have had a better man t&apos;.) advise them.   He                                                  has                          -2-
       has condacted a very complete survey and has made       definite recommendations as to the course which should       be followed in granting prospecting licences;  and he       has set out what further areas he considers should be       open to general prospecting and what areas should be       reserved for exclusive licences to large undertakings.       This report has been published.  On these matters the       Governor desires to follow Sir Albert Kitson1s advice.       I  have discussed the whole position very fully with       Sir Albert Kitson,  and I have told the Governor that I       concur in his view that Sir Albert&apos;s advice should be       followed.   I have,  however,  laid down the  condition,       in which the Governor fully concurs,  that the Governor       must be satisfied that his administrative arrangements       are complete and satisfactory before prospecting is       allowed in any area.  I should add that prospecting       is dealt with under the existing Mining Ordinance,       which is not affected by the recent Amendment of the       Native Lands Trust Ordinance,  which deals only with       excision for the purposes of leases.   It is obviously       desirable that the possible gold areas should be       thoroughly prospected in an orderly manner;  and it       will be an additional advantage for the Carter       Commission to be able to envisage as far as possible       the extent of probable mining development before they       make their final Report.                                  P.  C.-L.Colonial  Office,    February 13th, 1933.                              &quot;3w
