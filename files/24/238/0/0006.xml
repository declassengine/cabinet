February 1933.SECRET.CP. 37 (33).                                             -   Copy No...............!                                   CABINET.FUTURE  RESPONSIBILITY FOR  ADEN.       MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  INDIA.   The question of the separation ol  Aden  from India, to which 1 now invite theattention of 1113&apos; colleagues, has come  up for consideration in connection with thoproposals to be laid before Parliament in the  forthcoming White Paper on the indian constitution.  An important  question  of  policy is involved and  a  minor, but notunimportant, question  of  finance.    Before asking  my colleagues  to examine more closely the  details of these two problems, it may be  convenient that I should verybriefly indicate the present position in regard to Aden.                             THE PRESENT  POSITION.   2. Aden consists of two quite distinct parts        (1) the Settlement of Aden, which is in law part of British India, consisting of     a small stretch of territory containing the port and town of Aden, the Royal Air     Force headquarters, and the Royal  Garrison Artillery barracks; and       (2) the Aden hinterland, commonly known as the Adeu Protectorate, an area     of some 9,000 square miles, which  is not British Indian  or British territory, and     which  is under the control of a number of small Sheikhs in treaty relations with     His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Up to the  early part of  the  war responsibility, both administrative and financial(but subject in the latter case since  1900 to a  contribution, in respect of military expenditure, from  British  revenues), alike  for the Settlement and the  Protectoraterested with  the Government of  India, as it had since Aden  was conquered by troops-of the East India  Company from  Bombay in 1839.   During  the  wax-,  for military reasons, it  was found convenient, with the  agreement of the Government of India, totransfer the military control temporarily to the Home Government,  and responsibilityfor the political affairs of the Protectorate was similarly provisionally transferred.   Considerable  discussion took place  between  1921 and 192b&apos; as to the future of aden, and in particular as to the possibility of transferring it as a wholo from Indianto Imperial control.   But  for various  reasons no  satisfactory  arrangement  proved possible  until, in 1926, a  compromise was  reached under which  the military andpolitical  control  of Aden  was transferred to the  Home Government, subject to a financial contribution by India, the civil administration  of the Settlement remainingwith the  Government of India.  The Cabinet Conclusion (CP. C6 (26)) remarked :        &quot; This  arrangement  will secure Imperial control in  all essential matters, but     leave India the satisfaction of retaining Aden as part of India and still controlling.     the civil affairs of the Settlement including its resident Indian population.  In view     of this we consider that India should  be prepared to contribute  towards the     military and political charges a sum of  250,000 a year for three years and after     that  150,000  a year,  or one-third of the total cost . .  . whichever is the lesser     figure.&quot;    3. These arrangements have been in force  since 1927.   The chief local authorityat Aden, who has now the title of Chief Commissioner, Resident, aud Commander-in-Chief, and  who is  found alternately from the Indian Political  Department and theColonial Service,  is responsible accordingly to the Government of India for the civil administration of the  Settlement,  and  to His Majesty&apos;s  Government through theSecretary of State for the Colonies for the political affairs of the hinterland.  Defeuceis the concern of an Air Officer Commanding, directly subordinate to the Air Ministry.With a view to regularising the arrangements for military control resulting from theCabinet  decision of 1926, the Government of  India Act was in 1929  amended so asto provide  that arrangements might he made by Order in Councillor  the military168560 2.33
superintendence,  direction and  control of Aden;  and these have  accordingly beentransferred by Order in  Council from the Governor-General of India to the Residentsubject to the control of  the Home Government.                         NECESSITY  FOR  RECONSIDERATION.    4. The arrangements described above have on the whole worked without friction,though it is fair to add that no  special emergency has arisen  during their  periodcalculated to impose a severe  strain upon them.   In  the ordinary course no question would at this  stage  have arisen  of  disturbing  them.  But in  connection  with theforthcoming  Indian Constitution  Bill it  is  now  necessary immediately to  consider what provision shall be  made in the Bill, and consequently in  the White Paper, forAden, and in particular whether it shall continue  to he a part of  British India, and, if so, on what  conditions, or whether the balance of advantage rests with its immediate;separation.               VIEWS AND  ENQUIRIES OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.    5. In  these  circumstances,  I  thought it desirable to  invite the views  of  theGovernment of India at  the beginning of this year on the question generally  and inparticular on the desirability and feasibility of  complete  separation  of Aden from india.  The  Government  of India  have   not  yet  themselves reached  any  final conclusion.   But in reply to  my enquiry they have requested, in order  to  enablethem to decide whether, and, if so, on what conditions, they  are prepared to acceptseparation in principle,  that they  should  be informed whether,  in the  event  of separation, His Majesty&apos;s Government would  be prepared to        (i) relieve India  of the contribution  at present paid towards the military and     political administration ;                                                   v       (ii) maintain the policy of making Aden a free port:       (iii) assume liability for  the difference between revenue  aud  administrative     charges without imposing  additional  taxation  or  reducing  the  standard  of     administration.  The Government  of India state that the present  difference, on     the basis of figures for 19^9-30 to 1931-32, averages  about  2,000 a  year, but     that  in  the  event of transfer this would probably be  more  than covered  by     additional income tax receipts from certain Aden firms which  now pay all their     income tax in India  instead of Aden ;       (iv) retain a proportion of  Indian Service  personnel in Aden service for some     years alter transfer  takes place ;       (v) agree to retention of  the right of appeal in judicial  cases to the Bombay     High Court if this is found  to be administratively and legally possible.    A further point (vi) on which they were  anxious in the past  was that a guarantee should  be given that  in the event  of  transfer there should  he no racial legislation orsegregation  similar to the  measures applied to Indian settlers which have  been thecause of complaint in the past in East and South Africa.    G. These  requests have been  discussed  in the Standing Aden interdepartmental committee, and I  understand that  the Secretary of State  for the  Colonies sees  nodifficulty (subject  possibly to  the  drifting of a  formula in respect of point (ii)) in agreeing to  an affirmative answer on  points ?(ii) to (vi).   Point  (i),  and the general question of policy involved in  transfer, are in a different category.   Both are essentiallymatters for a Cabinet decision, and uo  advance is probable on  cither as the result offurther  interdepartmental discussion.   My  colleagues, to enable  them  to reach adecision, will presumably wish for an indication from  me of the importance from theImperial point  of  view of bringing about the separation of Aden  from India ; on theIndian  reaction to any proposal for  separation ;   and on the necessity for taking adecision at this stage.                      NECESSITY  OF  AN IMMEDIATE DECISION.    7.  I will deal with these points in inverse order.  I would observe as a preliminarythat it is at least necessary,  as I have mentioned above, to indicate in the forthcomingWhite Paper whether or uot any material change is contemplated in the position of aden ;  and, as I show below,  we are committed to full consultation  in India with theparties and  interests affected before any decision to separate  Aden  can he  taken.As  my colleagues are  aware, I  hope  that  the  White  Paper  will  be laid  beforeParliament, and  the Joint Select Committee set up,  before Easter.   The  matter is thus of the first urgency if any change is  contemplated.
   8. So ranch Tor our own time-table.   But need we face the issue of separation  atthis  stage ?  In my view, we must, and  no interim compromise is likely to provesatisfactory.  A decision to leave Aden under  India  would  incidentally necessitateprovision for Aden in the forthcoming Federal Structure and  raise difficult questions as to its representation in the Central Legislature.   Apart from this it would  alsonecessitate a solutiou of a difficult administrative question  (which would have to  be faced and  overcome in settling the terms of the  Indian White Paper), for Aden  is atonce an important military and political centre  and  a civil administration, and wemust reconcile the claims of all.   But above all, if (given the keen existing Indianinterest in  the Aden  question)  Aden  is  once  placed  under  the  authority of  theFederation, and once secures representation in the Central Legislature, the problemof its transfer from  Indian control, should  this later be thought desirable, thorny and difficult as it is at the moment, is  likely in  my judgment to become almost impossibleof solution on the lines we should desire.  The fact that Aden is part of Arabia,that it is geographically remote, and that out of its 50,000 inhabitants only 7,000 arcat the moment Indians, will carry no weight; we shall be faced with strong politicalopposition to any transfer of  an administered area of  the Indian Federation, and wemay have  to surmount v-ery  serious political difficulties if we  are  to carry transferthrough.   Transfer now and  at any future date  will  involve  legislation ; the indian constitution Bill is a  convenient  opportunity for getting  it; and  in  my considered opinion transfer, if  my colleagues  are satisfied that the arguments for transfer aredecisive, can best be carried through at the present stage.    9.  On  that assumption, I turn  to consider the Indian reaction  to a proposal for transfer (important,  in the  first  place, politically;  secondly,  as  affecting  financial-arrangements) ; and  the arguments from  the  Imperial standpoint  in  favour of thecompletion of the separation.                               THE INDIAN REACTION.    10.  A seutimental desire,  based probably to  some extent on apprehensions  of apractical nature, to  retain Aden as part of India,  has consolidated itself in indian political circles in the  last 10 years.   That sentiment must be reckoned with, for ithas behind it powerful  and vocal financial interests, centred largely in Bombay, whichhave sunk money in Aden.  Partly because of  the  importance of that sentiment theGovernment of India have found it necessary formally to  pledge themselves to prior-consultation with the Indian Legislature (though the consent of the Indian Legislatureis not  under the present  Constitution  legally necessary to a transfer) and with thevarious interests concerned, before any decision is taken in the direction of separatingAden from India.  There is, on the information available to me, no question  that anyproposal for the transfer of  Aden will meet with  considerable opposition from theLegislature and from the interests concerned.    IL  In these  circumstances, if we  decide  that  transfer is desirable on  Imperial^grounds and if it is to go through without difficulty in  India, it is most important thatthe Government of India should  be placed in  a position both to reassure individuals who are genuineL/  apprehensive  that  local  Indian interests will not  be  sufficientlysafeguarded in the event of a transfer, and to make it clear that with the separation of Aden no further financial  liability will fall on Indian  revenues.   Such legitimateapprehensions as may  be felt by  Indian  interests ought in my view to  be met  byguarantees on points &apos;(ii) to (vi) above.   As regards  the  continuance  of an  Indianfinancial contribution, I am myself quite satisfied that in no  circumstances  could an indian contribution to  expenditure at Aden be contemplated (save perhaps as part of ahypothetical arrangement for contributions from all parts  of  the Empire to which its maintenance is of direct importance) in the event of separation being approved.   Sucha contribution would, indeed, under the financial arrangements contemplated, not  have to be voted by the Indian Legislature.   But for all that it would remain open to theLegislature to debate the payment yearly, and  the  feeling of grievance which will, i fear, be left  by any decision  to separate Aden from India would be still further accentuated by the feeling that an unjustifiable contribution was being levied  from Indian revenues, which the Legislature might criticise but could not  affect.  In my judgment, even were it politically possible  to require such a contribution at this stage, it would  not be possible  to  maintain it.   If,  therefore, the balance of advantage is-thought to rest with  the transfer of Aden from India, we  must in my view face the fact that the resultant burden (at  the moment  rather  under  150,000 a year) mast be met from Imperial revenues.
                  DESIRABILITY  OE TRANSFER ON&apos;  IMPERIAL GROUNDS.   12. I now turn to the  importance of separation from  the  Imperial  standpoint.There are in the first place certain obvious arguments of a strategic nature, which I need not develop, for keeping under Imperial control a station the situation of whichis of such critical  importance.   I would  only refer to the findings of  the Committeeof Imperial Defence in 1923 (S./S. 3oth Minutes,  23rd July 1923)&apos;:-       &quot; (1) That  as  Aden  is an  essential fuelling  station on the Imperial lines of     communication to the  Far  East, it is of greater general strategic importance to     the Empire than to India.  It has also a strategic  importance with regard to the     Suez  Canal,  Somaliland  and Arabia, and  is  the  site of an important wireless     telegraph station.       &quot; 1,2) That so far as strategical considerations,  as  set out in  (1)  above, are     concerned,  it would  be advisable for the  administrative responsibility for Aden     to rest with the Imperial Government.&quot;    13.  It  is  important, secondly, that there  should he no misunderstanding as  to the implications of the constitutional position.   Section 33 of the present Government of India  Act vests  the  military superintendence, direction and control  of British India  in  the Governor-General in  Council.   That  section was amended in  1929 to admit of the transference of  the military control of Aden by Order  in Council to an authority designated  by the  Home Government.  But  this procedure does not permanently  dispose of the question of  transfer ;   and if  Aden is  to remain under- Indian control, and the Settlement of Aden is to remain part of British India in law, and to he  under the authority of the new  Indian Federation, military control at Aden will in the absence  of specific provision to the contrary automatically  vest  in the Federal Government, represented, of course, by  the Governor-General, since Defence- is to be reserved to his control.  It would conceivably be possible  to make specific provision  to  avoid this, and  while  retaining  Aden under  the  jurisdiction in other- respects of the Indian Federation, to vest the military control  of it in  the Home Government.  But even  if  we  adopted  such  a  course and thereby drew pointed attention to the anomaly we  were  creating or  perpetuating, it is a question whether matters would  remain  at this  point.  The  inclusion  of Aden under  the  Indian Federation upon its inauguration will very definitely compromise any future decision ; and, if I am right in the  view  expressed  in paragraph 8 above, it may finally decide the future of Aden.  If it does, then possibly not immediately, hut certainly ultimately, we  shall  have to face pressure, which we  may find  it difficult  to resist, lor the retransfer  of the military control  of the Aden Settlement to the Indian Federation. It will be most difficult under the new dispensation to defend, over any length of time,  the exercise by the Home Government, within a part of British India, especially if represented in  the Federal Legislature, of au independent military control.     14. There is a  subordinate  but important point in this connection.  I  do not propose to develop  it in detail,  for here as elsewhere  in this  question  our decision will he taken on  a consideration of general principles.  But clearly, if and when the military control  of  Aden were  to be retransferred  to the Indian  Federation, the question  of  an Imperial  contribution in respect of Imperial interests at Aden would call for consideration.                    SUMMARY OF  THE ARGUMENTS  ON EITHER SIDE.     15. I have  indicated in broad outline the problem as I see it.  I may perhaps now  summarise the position.  Aden is of great s&amp;rategie importance, primarily from  the  Imperial standpoint, and  the  Committee of Imperial Depence expressed the opinion  so  recently as 1923  that Imperial interests more than outweighed  Indian interests in  this respect.  At the moment  a compromise of  an interim  character is in force there,  as the result of  which, despite the fact that the Settlement of Aden is part of British  India, military and political  responsibility rests with  the Home  Government.  We  have reached a point in the preparation  of the new Indian Constitution at which it is  essential to take a decision as  to what the future of Aden shall be.  So far as can be  judged, this is likely to be the last opportunity for making a change (if  we desire to  make one) without greatly increased political difficulty, for a change will at all times  involve legislation, and legislation expressly excluding Aden from the Indian Federation  or giving power  to take action  by Order in Council can at the moment conveniently  lie passed through in the new Constitution Bill.   For the reasons  I  have given it is-
                                       oimpossible,  even  if we temporarily reserved  military  control  to  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment, to feel  confident that we should permanently  find it easy to maintain this position.  The alternatives before us are a decision either that  Aden should bebrought uuder the new Federation (with the consequent possibility, if not probability,that military control may sooner or later have to be  resumed  by the Government  ofIndia), or that it should now be wholly separated from India  and that responsibilityfor it should be taken over in toto by the Imperial Government.   16. If our decision is in favour of separation, then we must face the fact  that wecan hope  for no further Indian financial contribution once separation takes place.   Itwould  be politically most  unwise and  inexpedient to impose a contribution  against all Indian opinion, and it would probably in practice  be impossible  for any period tomaintain such a contribution, which, though not votable, would be open for discussion by the Federal Legislature.                             QUESTIONS FOR  DECISION.   17. I ask my colleagues in these circumstances to decide        (a) whether in their view  the balance of advantage rests with the separation    of Aden from India, and       (b) whether, if so,  I may inform the Government of  India  that in the event    of  their agreeing to  separation, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to    relieve them of the contribution at present paid by them towards  military and    political expenditure at Aden.
