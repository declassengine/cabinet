[This Document is the Property ot His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]                 Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1933.Joint Select Committee on the Indian Constitution.MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  SECRETARY  OE STATE  FOR INDIA.   I should like to have the approval of my colleagues  for certain proposals  as  to-the size of the Joint Select Committee and the number and status of the Indians whoare to participate in its  work.   I hope to have the White Paper containing theGovernments proposals  ready  in  time  for  motions setting up the Joint SelectCommittee  to be debated  in both Houses before Easter, and I also hope that it may be-possible  for  the  Committee to  come into existence  and have one meeting before easter to settle its procedure and geueral  arrangements.   A time-table is being worked out on this  basis.   As regards the Committee  itself, I suggest that its strength should be about 20,10 from the Lords (including Chairman) and 10 from the  Commons.   The Parliamentary  Resolution setting up  the Committee would empower it  to&quot;confer with Indians.&quot;  I think it would be preferable  to keep  the number of theIndian participators slightly less than  20, and  I  have asked the Viceroy, in  makingsuggestions as to names, to work provisionally on a basis of 15, 10 from British  Indiaand five from the States.   I have had reproduced as an Appendix to this Memorandum various pronounce-ments which have been made from time to time regarding the Joint Select Committeeand the participation of Iudians.  I would remind my colleagues that the proposal  toallow Indians to play a part in the Joint  Select Committee of greater importance thanthat  of mere  witnesses,  although undoubtedly  a novel  constitutional device, datesfrom the time of the original appointment of the Simon Commission (see, for example,the first two statements in the Appendix).  It is true that much has happened  since then, but from a constitutional point of view the only departure  from the procedure as contemplated by the Government in 1927 is  that the proposals of the Governmentwhich the Joint Select Committee with Indians are to  consider, instead of being basedmerely on the Simon Report as then intended, will be  based also on the later devolop-ments in the  Round Table Conference.   I  do not  think that  the status and  functions of  the Indian participators can  besusceptible of precise definition, and  questions relating thereto will in the main haveto be left to be solved by the Committee  itself as they arise.  It seems to me that one can only speak with certainty beforehand on two points.   The first is that the use ofthe words in  the resolution &quot; confer with  Indians&quot; will in  itself imply that the  latter will  be more  than witnesses.   The second is that, as  already stated by the Presidentof the Board of Education in the House of Lords on tho 9th February,  the&apos; Indianscannot actually be members  of  the  Committee or  be entitled to sign any report.Nevertheless, I should hope  that  the Committee will  be willing to avail itself of the.fullest consultation with the Indians at all stages  except the final one of producing itsown recommendation.   When the Committee holds its first meeting, I should  propose to invite it. to  adoptthe list of Indian participators which I shall propose in consultation with  the Viceroy.In the main they are likely to be prominent  members ol the Round Table Conference,though we  contemplate including one or two members of the Indian Legislature whowere not on the Conference.   The Joint Committee  will  undoubtedly also  have  to hear  a certain  number  of witnesses from India,  but  this  does not  present anyspecial difficulty.    India Office,17th February 1933.S.

APPENDIX. Statements in Parliament and elsewhere as to the association of Indians with the                     Joint Select Committee  on  the  India  Bill. Prime Minister (Mr. Baldwin) in House of Commons on Stli November 1927, repeated         by Viceroy (Lord Irwin) in Statement issued on Hth November 1927.    When the Commission has reported and its report  has  been examined  hy  the-Government of India and His Majesty&apos;s Government, it will be the duty of the latter to present proposals to Parliament.   But  it is  not  the intention of  His majesty&apos;sGovernment to ask Parliament to adopt these proposals without  first giving a full opportunity for  Indian opinion of different schools to contribute its views upon them,and to this  end it is  intended  to invite Parliament  to  refer these  proposals  to-consideration  by a Joint Committee of both Houses, and to facilitate  the presentation to that Committee both of the views of  the Indian Central Legislature  by delegationswho will be invited to attend and confer with the Joint  Committee, and also of  the-views  of any other bodies whom  the  Joint Parliamentary Committee  may desire to-consult.         Secretary of State for India (Lord Birkenhead) in House of Lords on                               24th November 1927.    Your Lordships, or  those who were interested iu Indian affairs at that time, willnot  have forgotten how considerable  was the  contribution,  how unremitting  theindustry of  the Joint  Committee which  reported  upon  the Montagu-Ohelmsfordproposals.   It is our intention to  set up a similar body.  Supposing it be the fact thatin spite of the constant contact in India between the Central Committee at the heart of government and the  Provincial Committees of the Legislatures in each Province towhich  the  Commission  will journey,  that  in  spite  of  all those  opportunities of ascertaining opinion the Indians have failed to make  good their view  upon. the independent and unbiased judgment  of the Commission, they  are not even  then compelled to acquiesce.    They will on the  whole have been  given an opportunity which  in my judgment has never been given in the whole history  of constitution-making to  any people who are in their position.  We invite the Central Government to  appoint a committee to come  and sit with our Joint Committee.  They can  examine  the Report  of  the Commission.  They are even given a function, if they could only  understand it, more important than  that of  the Commission itself.  When  once the Commission has made its Report, it has finished, but its critics remain and its critics are  most formally  and specially invited to  come and sit with  the Joint Committee in Parliament, and  to-develop any criticisms or objections that they feel to the Report which the Commission has made.    Extract from letter from Chairman of Statutory Commission (Sir John Simon)                to Prime Minister (Mr. MacDonald), ltith October 1929.    The procedure by  Joint Parliamentary Committee  conferring  with  delegations from the Indian Legislature  and  other bodies,  which was  previously  contemplated, and is referred  to in my letter to the  Viceroy of Oth  February 1928,  would  still he appropriate for the examination of the  Bill when it is  subsequently placed before Parliament, but would, we  think, obviously have  to be preceded by  some  such -Conference as we have indicated. Secretary of Stale for India (Sir Sa?nuel Hoare) in House of Commons, 21lh June 1932.    His i\Iajesty&apos;s Government consider that the final stage of consultation with Indian opinion can usefully take place only on definite  proposals.  They therefore propose to. invite both Houses of Parliament to set up a Joint Select Committee to consider their definite proposals  for  the revision of  the Constitution and  to  give  the Committee power to confer with representatives  of Indian opinion.   And it is their intention, iu the belief  that  this course will  commend  itself to  Indian opinion,  to invite Parliament to set up the Joint Select Committee  before the introduction of a Bill.  It has been the intention  of successive  Governments that a Joint  Select  Committee  of both  Houses of Parliament should be called  upon  at some stage to  examine  the
proposals for constitutional reform.   His Majesty&apos;s Government hope  that, by theirpresent decision to recommend that this important task shall be performedi^before any bill is introduced,  they will facilitate Indian co-operation  and ensure  its effectiveinfluence in what  is properly the  most important  stage  in the  shaping of  theconstitutional reforms and  at a time  before irrevocable decisions have  been reached by Parliament.   Viceroy (Lord WilUngdon) in Address to Indian Legislature, hth September 1932.    In this statement the Secretary of State  further announced the  intention of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government, after they had formulated their specific recommendations for indian  constitutional reform, to set  up  a Joint Select Committee  of  Parliament toexamine these proposals  in consultation with Indian representatives.        Secretary of State for India (Sir  Samuel Hoare) in House of Commons,                                  Uth july 1932.    Let  me  pass to the next  stage, to  the  Joint  Select  Committee stage.   Ourprocedure there is an unprecedented  procedure.   We were anxious  to  bring Indiansinto consultation and co-operation with the Joint Select Committee before this Housecould take any final decision, and  it is  our  firm intention  to make that  Indian co-operation and consultation  as  effective as ever we can during the stage of the joint select Committee.   We  believe that the Joint Select Committee wdll really be carryingon the spirit of the Round Table  Conference; that it will be the  spirit and theprocedure of the Round Table Conference applied to the particular conditions of thetime.  Moreover,  at the Joint Select  Committee the Indians will have the great advantage, which they never would have had upon  the Round Table Conference, of seeing  the  specific  proposals  of  the Government.    The  specific  proposals of theGovernment will be put before the representatives of this House and of another place,and will be put before the representatives of India, and discussion of that kind willbe far more profitable than  the necessarily indefinite discussions of a  large body likethe Round Table Conference where the  Government is obviously not in a  position toput its concrete proposals  before  the Conference, for  the overriding reason that theonly place before  which  the  Government  can  put  specific proposals is  Parliamentitself.President of Board of Education (Lord  Irioin) in House of  Lords, 9th  February 1933.    It is, of  course, impossible, as is, I think,  generally recognised, that Indians whoare thus called  into consultation  should actually be members of the Committee orenabled or entitled to sign  any Committee&apos;s Report.   The practice and the position of Parliamentary procedure would clearly  preclude  either or both of  those things.- Joint Select Committees are, I imagine,  within very wide limits, masters of their own procedure, but certainly it  would  be the intention of  the  Government to make the Motion on this matter in such form as would permit the fullest  consultation betweenIndian representatives and representatives of Parliament on the Joint Select Committee,as it would also  be the  earnest hope of  the Government that any  Joint  Select Committee of both Houses so set up  would gladly avail themselves of the opportunity- of such consultation for  the better discharge  of the great task committed to their hands.    My noble friend asked me who would select the Indian representatives who might be expected to come to  work with the Joint  Select Committee.  1 understand  that  at the present moment the Secretary of State is in consultation with the Viceroy on  that matter,  and that no final decision has yet been reached.  The object that the Viceroy and the Government of  India will have  in mind will  be to secure that those who come. are as representative as  is possible having  regard to  the necessity for the limitation-of numbers.
