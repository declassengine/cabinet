COPY NO.?/.&apos;..&quot;&quot;&quot;          MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER  OF  TRANSPORT50(53).                        WATERLOO BRIDGE.         As the Cabinet is aware the London County Council havereluctantly accepted the view that they should recondition theexisting &quot;bridge in accordance with, the suggestion made to them on &quot;behalf of the Government 0         Under Item 9 of Conclusion 1(33) the Cabinet asked what architect was to undertake the corbelling.   The council have appointed their own architect, Kr. G.  Tcpham Forrest, toact as architect,  in collaboration with the appointed engineers,Messrs. Rendel, Palmer and Tritton, and say that they will address a further communication to me in due course in regard to theappearance of the bridge after the corbelling-out process hasbeen completed.   As the design for corbelling is to be referredto the Royal Fine Arts Commission, I do not think that ?/e need or should press for the employment of an outside architect at thisstage.                                   (Intld.)  O.P.G.S.85th February, 1933.
