CONFIDENTIALnA,0,854*                 BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.                  STATE OF TRADE  - JANUARY. 1985.  Summary  of Reports submitted by members  of  the. Board..of Jp_ra.deAdvisory Council (&quot;supplemente&quot;d in some  cases  with,  information from&quot;&quot;other sources),.     Employjfient,  The total number of persons on the  registers ofEmployment Exchanges in Great Britain at the  23rd  January was2,903,065, an increase of 179,778 as compared with the 19thDecember,19320  The main variations were in London, South Lasternand South Western England C+ 81,226), Midlands (4-36,600), NorthEastern Division (4-29,903), North Y/estern  (4-16,223) and Scotland(4-15,254),     Insured workers in employment at the  23rd January numbered9,235,000, a decrease of 172,000  as compared  with  the previous month, and of 76,000 as compared  with a year  ago.   The declinein employment occurred chiefly in building, public worksconstruction, distributive trades, the  tailoring industry, andhotel, boarding house and road transport services.  There wasalso some decline in general and  electrical engineering,electrical apparatus manufacture, iron  founding and other metalindustries, in the cotton, wool,  and hosiery  industries, andin printing, publishing,  and bookbinding.  There was, however,some improvement in coalmining, slate quarrying and hat andcap manufacture.     Overseas, Trade - Imports in  January,  1933, were -554,124,000compared with 362,149,000 in January, 1932,  Exports ofUnited Kingdom produce and manufactures were  .329,205,000compared with 331,123,000 while exports of imported merchandisefell to  4,189,000 in comparison  with 35,239,000 in January,1932,\i&apos;he excess of imports over exports of merchandise,  bullion andspecie was 38,377,000 compared with 321,352,000 a  year ago.
q n n     The decline of  25 million in exports for the year 1932, ascompared with  1931, referred to in the summary for last month,was due wholly to price changes, the volume being very slightlygreater.     Railway, and Road Traffic.   During the four wee&amp;s ended23th January,  1933, railway traffic receipts declined by 969,000 (9.l9;s) compared with the corresponding period of 1932,the decline in passenger train traffic being 6i05%, in coal, coKeand patent fuel traffic 3.24$, and in other freight train traffic16.44:6.     Sew registrations of motorcycles in December, 1932,  comparedwith December, 1931, show an increase of 621 (34.4$) and of othermotor vehicles an increase of 2,834 (l$.6ja),  &quot;the latter figurecosnprising an  increase of 3,238 private cars,  and a decrease of404 commercial and other vehicles.     Coal-mini rip.   The output of coal for the year 1932 isestimated at 209,244 thousand tons, compared with 219,459thousand tons  in 1951.   Exports in 1932 amounted to 38.9million tons,  a decrease of 3.8 million tons as compared with1931.   Of the principal markets Canada, Finland and the scandinavian countries, Brazil, Uruguay and. the Channel Islandsimported more  in 1932 than in 1931, while there were largereductions in  the exports to Prance,  Germany,  Italy, Belgium,Holland, and the Irish Free State.   Shipments of bunker coaldeclined from  14.6 million tons in 1931 to 14.2 million tons in1932.     The average weekly output in the 13 wedcs ending January 21stwas 4,232,000  tons, being 3.35$ less than in the corresponding-period a year  ago.   The average employment was 778,500,  adecline of 58,100.   The weekly output per person was 5.50 tons which was 0.P1 and 0.52 tons higher than  last year and 1913respectively.     Coal exports for December 1932 compared with the previous
                                                        &amp; \J Jmonth shoved a decrease in the case of South Yteles, the Humberand East and Vest Coast of Scotland, and a small increase in theNorth-Vest Coast and North-East Coast districts.   The exportoutlook in South Vales suggests a slight improvement.   Asregards the North-East Coast, there is a lull in forward demand from Scandinavia possibly owing to the trade negotiations nowin progress.     The home demand for industrial coal is still low, but goodhouse coal is in steady demand.     Iron and Steel.   Conditions in January were very quiet,but the bulk of the available traCe in the home market is no?/going to British producers.   Continental prices have risenrecently as a result of reports that the International SteelCartel is being re-organised.     The demand for finished steel is irregular at home, butexport enquiries have improved.   In Scotland and on the North-East Coast trade remains very depressed, but in South Vales thedemand for sheet and tinplate bars continues to improve.     The production of pig-iron in January, 1933, was 286,600tons, a decrease of 43,400 tons compared with January, 1932.The output of steel ingjts and castings was 444,400 tons, anincrease of 14,700 tons over the corresponding period in 1932.     Shipping and Shipbuilding.   The slight improvement in freight rates in December, 1932, was reversed in January, theindex falling from 84.15 to 80.51.   Rates from Argentina,Vancouver and Australia have fallen to a level which precludesfurther despatch of ballast tonnage from this country.  Outwardcoal rates have fallen slightly.     The figures for 1932 passengor traffic as compared with 1931show a fall of 4v?  to India, and of 43;? to Australia and NewZe.-v.land.   Cargo traffic has increased by b% to India and by 70$to Australia, the latter figure being high on account of thepractical cessation of traffic in 1931.
                                                           210     The outlook in shipbuilding is more hopeful.   orders placed include 9 large tramp steamers, 2 coasting tramps,1 cargo and passenger steamer for China, and a tank bargefor Canada.  These orders are, in part, connected with a newdesign of hull which is expected to effect running economies.     1-Iaohine T00I3.  There is little change In the home trade,although the lighter industries show a slight improvement.Exports in January, 1955, totalled  140,000 compared with 261,000 in January, 1932.  The decrease is accounted for byexports to Russia which fell from  210,000 to  74,000, whileexports to other countries rose from  51,000 to  66,000.     Electrical Industry.  The ouoput  of electricity byauthorised undertakings in January, 1933, amounted to 1,336million units, an increase of 15$ over January,  193 2.     The percentage of productive capacity in use in theindustry fell slightly during the month to about 50$,  Theindices (1920 = 100) of orders received for heavy plant inJanuary, 19-3, --vere:  home 67 compared with 45 In January, 1932,and export 69 compared with 106.  Russian orders for heavyelectrical plant have recently gone to Germany rather than tothis country.  Orders for light material and house fittings havefallen off slightly, while importo have increased despite thetariff.  Uncertainty regarding the effect of the Salter Reporton Road and Rail Transport has caused orders for trolley&quot;buses  to be postponed,     Ivlo tor Indus try.  Deliveries of new cars for the home market  exceed the figures for the  corresponding  period lastyear, although  the  volume of  orders at present in hand isdecreasing.   The demand for heavy commercial vehicles Isstagnant.  The expansion In the export trade noted inDecember,  1932, has been maintained,  and in some marketsslightly increased.     Wool.  There i3 no marked change in the woollen industry.
                                                           211Export3 of topo and worsted yarns- in. December&quot;&quot; increased by1.7 million Ibg., and 0.3 million lbs. respectively over theoorresponding period in 19?1.  Exports of tops now account forone-fifth of the total output.  The improvement in the exportposition is due partly to the depreciation of sterling and, itis stated, partly to a desire abroad to hold goods rather thanmoney owin.;, to the political situation.   Cotton.  The improvement recorded in the cotton industryin December continued during January In the more settledconditions following tho agreements made on wages and the&quot;more looms&quot; question.  Deliveries of raw ootton to spinnersrose from 24.9 million lbs. a week in Deoember to 27el millionlbs, in January *  Unemployment dropped in January almost tothe  level of the lowest figure for 193 2.  The number ofweavers working short time was, however, greater.  The exporttrade in piece goods remains largely a question of competition with Japan.  The total exports of piece goods from GreatBritain were 28^ higher in 1932 than In 1951, while Japaneseexports rose by &apos;58fo in the first 11 months of 19?2 ascompared with the corresponding period of 1931.  The Japanesetrade with India and Ohina has declined to some extents butcompetition in other Far Eastern and Kiddle Eastern markets, inEgypt, the Argentine, South Africa, and Australia is beoomingincreasingly serious.   Other^Induatries. The home trade in boots, and shoesremains dull.  Exporters to Ireland are suffering from thepresent economio policy of the Free State.  Trade in rubbershoes both at home and abroo,d is suffering from intensiveJapanese competition.   The demand for rubber tyres hasbeen b3tter than In the corresponding period of la3t year.  Themargarine trade showed a reduotion of 5% in January, 193?;, ascompared with the oorre spending month of the previous year,probably on aooount of the present low price of butter. . &apos;&quot;                          ^5&quot;
Z12Deliveries of edible oils and fats have declined.   Heavychemicals show a slight improvement, but in dyestuffs bothtrade and prices remain at a very low level.   The outlook inthe cement trade is more promising, British exports havingincreased by 3.7% in 1932 while world exports decreased by19.7%.     Finance and Banking.  (a) London.  The publication of the1932 balance sheets of the big banks showed that the totaldeposits of the ten London clearing banks had increased by.C.235 millions, while advances had fallen by  132 millions.     Honey rates during January have not maintained the harder-tendency which developed during December.   The reduction ofthe floating debt, the broadening of the credit basis byofficial purchases of foreign currency ana the influx of moneyto London following the -g- per cent reduction in New York moneyrates combined to prevent any lasting rise.   Treasury Billswere allotted at an average price of 15s4d.$ during Januarycompared with  1.0.10d.fi in December.   Gilt edged prices rose.     The South African   has now aligned itself with sterling and the New Zealand Government have raised the discount of theNew Zealand .3 against sterling from 9% to 25?j despite theopposition of the banks.     (b) Canada.  The Canadian dollar has weakened, and in viewof the powerful industrial interests now supporting the primaryproducers in their demand for inflation there are grounds forthe belief that parity with sterling may be reached.     (c) United States.    There was little change in thesituation during January.   The reduction of the dividend on united States Steel Deferred to 2 dollars has been interpreted as a sign of the uncertain outlook for the next few months.     Failures of small banks, particularly in the South West,continue.   Honey in New York is almost unlendable, 91-day

(d) France,  The uncertainty of the political situation  wasreflected in the outflow of gold to the value of 800,000,000francs from the Bank of France.   (e) Germany.   Conditions on the Money Market were easierduring January, and it is hoped that the present discount rateof 4;S will bo lowered,   A new &quot;standstill&quot; agreement has been negotiated to replace that expiring at the end of the month.     The Budget deficit for the year ending 31st March,  1933,is estimated at R.M. 800 millions with an accumulated deficit of RoM, 2 milliards.   Exports in 1932 totalled R.M. 5,739milliards (a fall of 36.3^).   The export surplus fell  from.M. 2,9 milliards in 1931 to 1 milliard in 1932.   Retail Trader,   The value of sties decreased by 0.7^5 inDecember 1932 compared with December 1931.   This was the smallest decrease since January 1931.    The position in Londonand the South of England remains much better  than elsewhere;Bales in the non-food departments increased by 5.3;&apos;  in  London(Suburban), 1.9i* in London (West) end 1.7$ in the South ofEngland, while in Scotland and the North of England there weredecreases of 3.3%I and 2.6,3 compered with December 1931.   Stockshave decreased by 7.6$.     Taking departmental stores only,  trade in December inGreet Britain fell by 1.1$, compared with falls of 23;-C  and.9% in the United States and Germany respectively.   Australian Trader   For the 6 months ending 31st December,1932, the value (in Australian pounds) of imports was 38,766,000 and of exports  50,648,000.   The corresponding figures in 1931 were  27,931,000 and  50,111,000 respectively.     Exports of flour and canned fruits were  less, while butterexports increased.  Between the 1st July and  the 31st December,1932, 2,434,000 bales of wool were received in store,  and over50i of this was sold st an average price of 8,56d. per  lb.
     Shipments of wheat up to 26th January reached 26,168,000bushels ss compared with 24s574,000 bushels in the previous year,   C&amp;nudiMii Trade.   The volume of business declined generallyduring the first hali of 1952 but there was some recoverylater.   wholesale prices reached pre-war levels at the end ofthe year.   Exports amounted to $501,839,000, exceeding imports by $-1-9,225,000.   This was a reversal of the position in 1931when imports amounting to $628,098,000 exceeded exports by$10,855,000.     Imports of raw cotton in 1932 Mere 97,360,000 lbs.compared with 94,910,000 lbs. in 1931, indicating the relatively favour&amp;blo position oi the industries producingconsumers&apos; goods.     Gold production in 1932 rose by 13c4^ to 3,055,000 fineounces.     In December business operations were st a lower leveltht.n in the previous month.   The index of manufacturingproduction  ell from 72c3 to 70.2.   Imports showed a markeddecline, while exports rose moderately.   Exports of copper,nickel, zinc and asbestos increased, and lead productionshowed a small gain.   Imports of raw cotton declined, contraryto seasonal tendencies.   Indian Trade,,   Imports and exports in 1932 amounted to134 and 133 crores of rupees, respectively, compared with 135and 169 in the previous year.   Net exports of gold rose from34 crores of rupees in 1931 to 74 in 1932.  As a result thebalance of trade in India&apos;s favour increased from 61 croresin 1931 to 79 in 1932.   The wholesale price index fell from90 in November, 1932, to 33 in December.                 (A crore - 10 million rupees).-S-
