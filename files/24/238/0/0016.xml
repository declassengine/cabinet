AC T,t-. 1930-.-          EXTENT OF APPLICATION  OP SECTION-&apos;116 -RELATING                      TO.COMPENSATION.                                          Copy No.    37-            MEMORANDUM BY  THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.         Section 116 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930,  confers onofficers and servants of a?:local authority who suffer  directpecuniary loss &quot;by virtue  of the Act or of anything  done  inpursuance or in consequence thereof&quot; a right to compensation,subject to certain conditions.   The compensation is payable outof the Road ^Fund.         Section 105 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930,  empowerslocal authorities authorised to  run public service vehicles tomake agreements with other local authorities or any  other personrespecting the management, working and maintenance of  services.         Tho Transport and General Workers1 Union has  askedwhether the  right of certain of its members to compensationfor pecuniary loss due to  anything done under Section  105 is admitted in principle.   Claims  have in fact been received from two employees (a Foreman Blacksmith and an Inspecting  Mechanic)of the Keighley Corporation who  have lost their employment inconsequence of the acquisition of tho Corporation Tramways by theKeighley and West Yorkshire Services Limited.&quot;         The Opinion of the&apos; Lav/  Officers of tho Crown  has beenobtained&apos; and they have&quot; advised that&apos; &quot;an employee of  a  LocalAuthority who has been In  the employ of the Authority  for thepre scribed-period;.- and whose&apos; appointment&apos;Is determined or whosesalary is reduced because&apos;  his services&apos;are not required or his duties are diminished by-reason-  of: ah :agreement relating  to themanagementworking and maintenance of any service  of  publicvehicles made under Section&quot; 105  is entitled to compensation underSection 116&quot;.SECRET.C. P. 47 (35 ).
         The Section in question was introducod as a nev/ clauseduring the Committee Stage in the House of Commons, at the instance of the National Association of Local GovernmentOfficers.   It is clear from the statement of the Minister whointroduced the clause (Mr. Herbert Morrison) and from thecourse of the debate in Committee that the intention was to limit the payment of compensation to officers of localauthorities displaced or otherwise suffering  direct pecuniaryloss by virtue of the transfer of the licensing jurisdiction of public service vehicles from local authorities to the traffic commissioners under Part IV of the Road Traffic Act, and notto apply the section to arrangements made under the &quot;enabling&quot;powers conferred on local authorities by Section 1C5.   It isin any case indefensible to place liability to pay compensation in such cases on the Road Fund, and some amendment of tho Actis clearly called for.         I propose that a Bill should be introduced repealingthe obligation put upon the Road Fund arising from the fact thatthe section was made to apply to the whole Act and not limitedto Part IV, and conferring no rights of compensation upon thestaff affected by agreements under Part V of the Act, hutproviding that the liability upon the Road Fund should not beremoved retrospectively, i.e. in respect of any agreemententered into (and, v/here approval is necessary, approved)before the date oi&apos; the introduction of the Bill.         I ask the approval of the Cabinet to this course ofaction.                          (intld. )  O.F.G.S.27th February. 1955.
