HIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3  GOVERNMENT..P. 41/33.                                             COPY NO.  41                     CABINET.           THE DRAFT INTSPNATIONAL CONVENTION             ON HOURS Oli- WORK IN COAL MINS3.    Memoranda by the President of the Board of Trade.     At their meeting on February 15th, the cabinet decided (Cabinet 9 (33), Conclusion 5 (b)) that I shouldcontinue efforts up to February 20th, in order to try and find some point or points on which the Government wouldhave the support both of the Miners Federation and theMining  Association in urging objections to the ratifica-tion of the Convention in-its present form.  I now circulate, for the information of my colleagues, an explanation of why I found it -impossible to take action onthese lines.      The Under Secretary for Mines had an opportunity ofa talk to the Secretary of the Miners Federation immediatelyafterwards, and Jar. Ebby Edwards called his attention tothe fact that, although officialrythe Federation is committed to press for ratification of the Convention, theyhad in fact made no reference to the question on this occasion, and he admitted in private that the federation was far more concerned with the quietness and stability ofthe industry at the present time than with any internationalhours convention.     Mr. Edwards also said that the Miners&apos; Internationalwere going to Geneva to demand an opportunity of putting the workers&apos; case before the assembled government representatives.  He had been invited to accompany them,but had refused to do so.
S8     It seems quite clear, that, privately, the Miners&apos;federation have no desire for ratification in the near future;but, on the other hand they are publicly committed to it and?s&apos;r. Edwards said that, if approached officially on the subjectof the Convention or on the technical difficulties, he wouldhave no alternative but to reply that the Miners&apos; federationdesired the ratification of the Convention and were of opinionthat the technical difficulties raised by the i-Iining Associationcould be met, within the terms of the Convention, by agreementbetween the British owners ana miners.     This being so, it seemed clear to me that any attempt tocarry out the Cabinet decision on this point would embarrassboth- the Government and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain,and I therefore took no further sJ-:.s on the question.                                         V. Reard  of Trade, 20th February,  1933.
