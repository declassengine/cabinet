STATEMENT  RELATING TO  DEFENCE.                               I.                         INTRODUCTORY.   IN each of the last four years a Statement on  Defence has been presented to Parliament about the time  of  the publication of theDefence  Estimates,  dealing  with  some  aspect of  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s general policy  in. Defence matters.   Thus, the  State-ment of  1936* explained in outline the plan  which had been  drawnup for the reconditioning and modernisation  of  our Defence forces:while the  Statement of  1937, t  which coincided  with  the  intro-duction of the Defence Loans  Bill, .1.937, dealt mainly  with the  extentof the programme and the order of  magnitude of the  expenditure involved.   2.  The present  Statement is likewise presented to parliament at the same time as  the introduction of a Defence  Loans Bill.  It is appropriate, therefore, that this Statement should deal with the costof the Defence programmes,  and  should at the same  time give such general  indication of the progress of the programme. as is possible without  detriment to the public interest.  Fuller particulars  on someof the subjects dealt with  in this paper will  be given later  in the memoranda   accompanying   the   Estimates  of  the   defence departments.   3.  Two years ago,  when the  Defence Loans Bill,  1S37, -was introduced,  His  Majesty&apos;s Government informed  Parliament that,in their  view, while Defence expenditure during the ensuing yearscould not equitably be met entirely from revenue,  neither the total amount which must  be raised from capital, nor  the total period over which such  capital  expenditure  must be  spread,  could  then be predicted.   Since, however,  constitutional usage required  that theDefence  Loans Bill should specify upward limits, which could  not be exceeded  except  by further statutory  authority,  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment sought authority for the issue of sums not exceeding inthe aggregate  400  millions, to be applied as appropriations  in aid of the moneys provided by Parliament for the Defence Services overthe five  years the 1st April, 1937, to  the 31st  March,  1942.  Thefigure of  400  millions represented  the maximum  aggregate  sumwhich could  be provided from borrowed moneys  or from  the OldSinking  Fund  towards  the total  cost of Defence without a furtherauthority from Parliament.   If events showed that amendment was called for, either in  the maximum amount or in the  period of years           * Cmd. 5107.[18G33]t Cmd. 5374.
specified in the Resolution presented  with the Bill, the  necessary measures would be submitted to Parliament.   4.  In  the  concluding section  of  the Statement of February,1937, it was  stated that, taking the programme as it then stood, itwould be imprudent to contemplate a  total expenditure on Defenceduring the five  years April,  1937,  to  March,  1942, of much lessthan  1,500  millions.  A year later,  in the  Statement of March,1938,* it was stated that it must be expected that the total expenditureon Defence in this period would exceed this sum.   5.  For some time past it has  been evident that the borrowing powers conferred by the Defence  Loans Act,  1937,  would not suffice to meet the total cost of the programme, in so far as it  could not bemet  from revenue.  On  the 29th -November  last  the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer stated in reply to a question in the House of commons that  it was his intention at the appropriate time in the  ensuing yearto ask Parliament to pass legislation to give further borrowing powers.   6.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that it is necessarythat  these increased borrowing powers  should be obtained forthwith,and  they are accordingly asking Parliament  to authorise the issueof a further  400 millions (making in all  800 millions) to be provided from borrowed  moneys or  from the Old Sinking Fund,  towards  thetotal cost of  Defence programmes authorised by Parliament  duringthe five years the 1st April,  1937, to the 31st March,  1942.  Theauthority of  Parliament  is also  asked  to extend the  scope  of  theservices to  which borrowed moneys may  be  appropriated in aid, soas to include  Civil Defence.  The reasons for  this step are explained in paragraph  10.                                            &apos;                               II.                COST OF THE DEFENCE  PROGRAMMES.   7.  In connection with the increased borrowing powers now askedfor,  it is the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Government to give Parliamentinformation as to the extent to which the existing borrowing powers have been  exhausted, and  the best estimate which can be  formedof the probable  total of  Defence expenditure over the  five years to march,  1942.   8.  The&apos; expenditure of the three Defence Departments for 1937was  approximately  262 millions.  In  the  current financial year(1938) the corresponding total  (including projected supplementary estimates)  is about   388 millions.   In  the  financial year which  starts  on the  1st April,  1939,  theEstimates for the three Defence Departments,  which  will be published in the course of the next fortnight, will be some  523 millions.* Cmd. 5G82:
   9.  The total expenditure on Defence in the first  three years:ofthe quinquennium thus amounts to over  1,173. millions.   The figures in the preceding paragraph relate only to the expendi-ture  of the three Defence Departments (including the Eoyal OrdnanceFactories  Vote).  It is, however, also necessary to take into accountexpenditure which is in essence . for. Defence purposes, but which isborne on the votes for Civil Departments&quot;.   10.  The  expenditure  on  Air Kaid Precautions  amounted  to Qj  millions in 1937.   For the year 1938-39 it is estimated to reach 9^  millions (including a Supplementary Estimate in prospect), while for the year 1939-^0 the estimate is  42 millions (exclusive of assist-ance to vital public utility services  and water  for emergency fire-fighting purposes, estimated at  9 millions).  Expenditure on  storageof food,  fertilisers  and petroleum amounting to  8^ millions  was incurred  in  1938, and the Estimates for 1939 make provision  for 5 millions.&quot; Having regard to  the magnitude of the  sums involved,and  also to the fact that much of the expenditure under these headscan  be regarded as  of  a capital nature,  His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave (as  already stated) reached the conclusion that it  is desirablethat  tire scope of the  services  to which borrowed  moneys  may beappropriated  in aid  should be  extended  to include   Civil  defence requirements,  such  as  Air Paid Precautionary services,  EmergencyHospital organisation and Food reserves.   11.  Of the borrowing  powers conferred by the Defence LoarnAct, 1937, approximately  65 millions were used in 1937, and it kestimated that approximately  132 millions will be used in the current year.  Thus, of the original borrowing powers conferred,  197 millionshave been used and  203 millions remain.   12.   The total  Defence expenditure in 1939, including  expendi-ture on Civil Defence, will be in the neighbourhood of  580 millions.That figure exceeds the current year&apos;s expenditure, after taking intoaccount  Supplementary  Estimates,   by  some   175   millions,  andexceeds the  portion of  the current year&apos;s  Defence expenditure  to bemet from revenue  by some  307  millions.   It  is  clear that  theavailable  revenue and  the unexhausted borrowing powers  conferred by the Act of 1937 will not meet the  total Defence expenditure to be incurred in 1939, and  that it will be  necessary to make some use in1939 of the  increased borrowing powers now asked for.   13.   The position in regard  to the probable rate of expenditure inthe  two remaining  years of the  quinquennium is alluded  to in  the concluding section  of  this  paper.   In brief,  the  position  may  besummarised  as follows.    14.   The earlier stages  of the programme have now been com-pleted.   Industrial  capacity  has  been  largely   increased,   newmodels have been  designed  and tried out, and are  in production.The initial difficulties met with in any large  programme of production     [18633]                                              B 3
have been largely overcome.  All three Service Departments are now-receiving armament stores of  all kinds  and of the latest models,  in very large  quantities, and production will continue on an increasingscale.   The  extent of   the   programmes   and  the  expenditurethereon  in  the  ensuing  years  of  the  re-armament  programme must,   however,   be  determined  by   our   own  Defence  needs,judged  in  the  light  of&quot; the  world  situation.   While,  there-fore,  the  measures of acceleration  which  have  been undertakenhave  contributed to the  extent  of  the  Defence  expenditure  to  be incurred in the ensuing financial year, it is at present impossible to predict  how soon the needs of  the situation will permit  of a slowing down of the production of  armaments.   15.  It should be added that, while the  programmes have  been planned with  a view to securing an  adequate supply of armamentsrequired for our  own  defensive  needs,  suitable  arrangements  havebeen made to secure that the programme could be  effectively adjustedin the light of any improvement in  the  international situation, with due regard to the interests of  the Exchequer.                               HI.MAIN REASONS FOR THE INCREASE  IN THE COST OF THE PROGRAMMES.   16.  It is clear, from what has been said above, that the aggregateexpenditure on the Defence programmes over the five years from the1st April,  1937,  to  the  31st  March, 1942, will be substantially inexcess of the estimate of  1,500 millions, given under all reserve, inthe  Statement of two years  ago.   It  is  appropriate, therefore, topreface the fuller particulars given later, with some indication ofthe main factors responsible for this increase.   17.  One factor which  has  led  to  increased expenditure is theever-increasing complexity of  modern armaments, to which attention has  been  drawn in  earlier  Statements.   The ingenuity  of  theinventor is for ever resulting in new devices and improvements which,while they add to the effectiveness of the weapons  in question,  alsoadd  appreciably to the cost.  Every effort is,  however, being madeto ensure that designs are, so  far as possible, simplified and renderedsuitable for large-scale production.   18.  The main reason, however, for the substantial increase in expenditure on  the programme lies in the  extent  to which it hasbeen necessary to enlarge  the original programme, in order to make adequate provision for defence against the contingency of  air attack.   19.  The  Air  Estimates for 1939  exceed   200 millions.   Theheavy rate of expenditure on the Royal Air Force is, of course, mainlyaccounted  for  by the very large  number of  modern  aircraft  now coming into the squadrons, as a result of the increased manufacturing
capacity and the improved production arrangements now in operation.It should be added that, notwithstanding the measures which  arebeing  taken to  reduce  the  number  of types, and  to  simplifyproduction, the cost of aircraft which embody  the latest improvements in design and technique,  and give  greatly improved performance, is necessarily much heavier.   20.  In  addition to  expenditure on the manufacture of new  air-frames, engines, equipment  and stores of all kinds, heavy  capitalexpenditure is  still  being incurred on  providing additional  manu-facturing  capacity, and on  the construction  of new stations.   Theformer subject is referred to in paragraph 30.  As regards the latter,in the current year a large  programme of works services  has been undertaken.  Work has been started  on thirty-seven new. stations,including Operational Stations, Flying  Training  Schools, technical and  Armament Training Schools  and Maintenance Units.   At anumber  of  established  aerodromes temporary  hutments  are beingreplaced by permanent structures so as to give improved accommoda-tion,  and enable better use to be made of existing facilities.   21.&apos;  As an essential counterpart to the increase in the Air Force,our active ground defences against  air attack  have been  substantially increased. Very substantial&quot; progress has been made with the original programme of  new  anti-aircraft  guns and searchlights.  Meanwhilefurther orders have  been  placed,  which will have the effect of greatlystrengthening our anti-aircraft defences, and steps  have been takento increase the manufacturing capacity for&apos; guns.  The programmeunder this  head  includes a  large  number  of new drill halls  andmobilisation and equipment stores,  many of which are now completedor approaching completion.   The original programme for the balloonbarrage has likewise been extended.   22.   Civil Defence  measures are  explained  in  a  later section.As will be seen from  the  figures given in paragraph  10,  these measures involve very substantial expenditure,  the chief heads ofwhich are : respirators and protective  clothing and equipment for AirEaid Precautions personnel: fire-fighting appliances,  steel  sheltersand  the  strengthening of basements;  storage  of  food and other essential  commodities;  and  the special  measures   to  be  taken byelectricity, gas and water undertakings and by the railway companies.                                IV.                     PROGRESS OF PRODUCTION.    23.  Navy. The needs in  regard to Naval . construction, . and the  means proposed for meeting  them,  were fully set out in the Statement  relating  to  Defence presented   to  Parliament in  1937 (Cmd.  5374).
   24   The speed with which  the  strength  of the Eoyal Navy isnow  being increased is  shown  by  the  following table of tonnagebuilding at successive dates-January  1,  1935      ---January  1,  1936January  1,  1937January  1,  1938January  1,  1939March 3.1, 1939 (expected)139,300291,900375,700547,000544,000659,500   During the forthcoming financial year some sixty men-of-war areexpected to be added to the Fleet, at a total tonnage of about 120,000.In addition, miscellaneous vessels of a tonnage of about 25,000  willbe added.   25.  A comparison of our  present shipbuilding  effort  with thatof the years before the  Great War shows  that the average  annualtonnage of  the  principal classes of warship,  excluding submarines,completed during the three  financial years 1911, 1912,  1913,  was170,000.  The  corresponding  average for  the tonnage expected tobe completed during  the two years 1940 and 1941 is 219,500.   Incomparing the  present rate  of shipbuilding  with pre-war years,  itis, however, necessary to take account  of  the increased  complexity of the modern warship,  and of her armament and equipment.   26.   Two capital  ships were included in the New construction programme for  1936, three in 1937 and two in 1938.   It is proposedto include another two  in the 1939 Programme, so  that altogetherthere will be nine of these  vessels under construction.  It is also proposed to include  in the  Naval building programme for  1939 two destroyer flotillas, and twenty  fast  escort vessels of a new type intended  for the protection  of shipping against  submarine  and air attacks.  Provision will also  be  made  for the  building  of  another aircraft  carrier (making six  in all  under  construction, excluding Ark  Royal which has now  been completed  and is  in commission), four large  6-in gun cruisers,  and some smaller vessels.  The full programme will be published with the Navy  Estimates.    27.   Modernisation   of  existing  capital ships   is  proceeding steadity, and three  ships are  at present in hand  for this purpose. Great  progress has  been made in strengthening the anti-aircraft armaments of other  ships of the Fleet.     28.   Army. The  re-equipment of  the  Army  with  up-to-date weapons and the accumulation of the approved scale of war reserves is proceeding rapidly.     Substantial deliveries are now being received and production of many  items has reached the  stage when completion  is in sight.  As explained  in   paragraph 21,  provision  of additional  anti-aircraft equipment has been put in hand.  Large extensions of manufacturing
capacity have now become effective and further extensions of manu-facturing capacity will come into operation this year.  :  29.   Work on the large programme for the construction of newEoyal Ordnance Factories (including factories for the manufacture,of explosives, and for filling shells and bombs) which was taken in.hand at the outset of the programme has been accelerated.    30.   Royal Air  Force. During the past year  various measures have been taken to broaden the basis of production, in order to increase and accelerate the programme,  including  provision of the necessaryreserves.  The system of erecting factories at  Government expense,to be  managed for and on behalf of the Government  by businessfirms with  experience  of quantity production,  has been  extended;and similar arrangements have  been made for the erection of new factories and  extensions to existing factories by firms in the aircraft industry.    81.   In the early part of the  year a special procedure  was adoptedin order to expedite the placing of the large orders required for the-programme,  so  as to enable constructors. to make  their plans  andorder raw material  well  in  advance.  It was also decided that partof the additional  volume  of orders should be placed with manufac-turers having capacity which would be of value in aircraft production,and who controlled large bodies of skilled labour.   Accordingly theaircraft industry was required to sub-contract with such firms a largeproportion of the orders  received.  In addition,  the  help of largeengineering  organisations  controlling,  or  in  association&quot; with,  anumber  of subsidiaries  has also been enlisted.  The  method  to beadopted  in this latter case is for  the principal firm to arrange for theproduction of  airframe components in the various allied factories  andto undertake  their  assembly in a central factory  to  be erected at government  expense.   32.   Steps have  also  been  taken with  a  view to building  upmanufacturing capacity  in the Dominions.   Contracts have alreadybeen placed in Canada for large  bomber aircraft and fighter aircraft,and  a Mission is now in Australia, by invitation  of the commonwealth government,  with a:view to concerting action with that Dominion.This Mission will  also visit. New. Zealand..   Orders  for the supply ofgeneral reconnaissance and training aircraft have been placed in theUnited  States of America..   33.   In the course of the current financial year the monthly rateof delivery of aircraft to  the Royal Air  Force has been more  than doubled, and will  show further substantial increases.
V.                           PERSONNEL.   34.  Although the Defence Services require, to a greatly increasingdegree,  men with technical qualifications, which  involve  a higher standard of training, the inflow of personnel,  while  maintaining itshigh standard of quality, has  kept  pace  with the expansion of theServices.   85.  The mobilisation of the Fleet, and partial mobilisation of theAir Defence Organisation, in connection with the crisis last September,afforded a  practical test  of the machinery for calling up the reserve and  Auxiliary personnel of  the Services.   The test was. highlysatisfactory, and it is gratifying to be able to record that the  personnelconcerned  responded to  the call with great readiness and alacrity.The machinery has  been improved as  a  result  of the experience gained.   36.  Navy. The lowest total of Naval personnel in recent years was  89,214,  in 1932.   Since  that date the total of Naval  personnelhas  been steadily increased.   The following table shows the numbersborne at the end of each financial year, and the increase as comparedbornewith the preceding year :            Increase.90,295        1,0811933-34    ...1934-351935-361930-37    ...1937_38           *      1&quot;-   _____&apos;  &apos;1938-39  (numbers voted)...   119,000*       7,190 91,927        1,632 97,312        5,385101,868        4,556111,810        9,942   37.  In  the  six years 1933-38,  the personnel of the Fleet will thus have been increased by 32,000,  an increase of 36 per cent.  Theincrease  contemplated during the financial year 1939, including anincrease of 4,000 required in the Fleet Air Arm, is  12,000.  It is alsoanticipated  that during  next financial year  a  very considerable expansion will take place in the Naval Reserves, including the creationof new R.N.V.R. Divisions primarily for the purpose of giving trainingin anti-aircraft work.    88.   The  number of  recruits entered, which  in 1931 was just over 3,000, was in 1935  over  8,000;  in 1936 it was 11,500,  and in1937 it was nearly 16,000.  During the first three quarters  of 1938over 11,000 recruits  have been raised.    39.   Army. During  1938, 37,323 recruits joined  the  RegularArmy.   This was 12,753 more than joined in the previous year and   * Now being increased by 2,000 in consequence of Fleet Air Arm expansion.
constituted a record for post-war normal recruiting.  The enlistmentand training of boys as  artificers, specialists, &amp;c, has been, and is,being largely expanded.   A new school has  already been  established at Jersey and  further new schools  are in course of preparation  atChatham and Arborfield.  It is  hoped to have over 4,000  boys under training by the end of the year.  A new section E of the Regular-Army  Reserve  has been created to  provide a  pensioner reserve  ofwarrant and non-commissioned  officers whose services can be utilizedon mobilization as instructors at training and similar establishments.   40.  The  number   of  candidates  from  all  sources schools,universities,  Supplementary  Reserve  and  Territorial  Army forcommissions in the Regular Army now greatly exceeds the demand.This is a complete reversal of the situation two years ago, when it wasimpossible to fill the number of  vacancies offered.   41.   Better terms for pay and pension have been instituted ; a newclass of warrant officers  (Class III) has been established.  This offersa further opportunity to other  ranks to rise to positions of respon-sibility  in  command.   Warrant   officers   (Class  III)  are  now.commanding sub-units previously  commanded  by subalterns.   42.   1938 was an exceptionally good recruiting year in the Terri-torial  Army.   77,142 recruits  joined, compared  with  45,320 in theprevious year.   This is the largest number of recruits ever entered ina single year.    The  strength  of the Territorial Army is nearer  its establishment than at any time in its history7. Several divisions (fiveout of eighteen)  are over establishment,  and  the average  for- alldivisions  is  over  90  per cent, of  establishment.   The  increase inestablishment  consequent on the  increase  in  the number  of  anti-aircraft divisions calls for a continuance  of active recruiting for theTerritorial Army.   In 1939 over 100,000 are estimated to be requiredto meet the increase in establishment and to replace wastage.    43.  Royal  Air Force. The number of recruits required  for the Air Force during  the  financial year ending the 31st  March,  1939,was by far the  largest for any single year since 1918.  The programmeinvolved the entry during the  year of some 31,000 officers, men andboys,  including 1,700 pilots,  and  present  indications are that the actual  entry may  reach 35,000.  An entry of the order of 20,000 will be required for the regular force during 1939, and it is therefore essential that  a steady flow of  recruits of the high quality which was attained during 1938 should continue.  A scheme for  direct reeruit- ment  of  air observers has been in  operation since  August 1938,  to meet  the  increased demand  for air  crews.    44.  Training  facilities of  all kinds have been extended.   There are now twelve Service Flying Training Schools and three more will shortly be opened in  Scotland, while flying training both  for  the Royal  Air Force  and the Royal Air  Force  Volunteer Reserve is now being carried out at over thirty civil  flying schools.
   45.  At the beginning of the current financial year the Royal AirForce  Volunteer  Reserve comprised a  section  for pilots&apos; and  a section for medical officers.  An additional air section for  air crewshas been formed,  together with  ground  sections,  both for officersand men, corresponding to the different branches  and trades  of theregular Air Force.  Over 2,500 volunteer reservists are now beingtrained as pilots.  Recruiting for most of  these  new  sections  was opened in connection with the National Service Appeal in January,and  a- large  number of applications have been received:  In orderto secure the services  in emergency of men who already had AirForce  experience, a. special scheme of entry into Class  &quot;E&quot;  of theReserve  was introduced in July last for ex-airmen and pensioners  ofthe Royal Air Force.                                VI.                          ORGANISATION.   46.  Fleet&apos;Air Arm. -The transfer of the administration of theFleet Air Arm from the Air Ministry to the Admiralty is proceeding.It is anticipated  that  the aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm, togetherwith the necessary stores and equipment, will be transferred from thecontrol of the Air Ministry  to  that of the  Admiralty early  in thenew financial year.  The Air Ministry  will, however, continue  forthe  time being  to  be  responsible  for  the  maintenance  and repair of aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm on  an agency basis.  In accordancewith the terms of the  decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the transfer of administrative control to the Admiralty, the Air Ministry will remain  responsible for the  supply  of material for  the Fleet Air Arm,  as well as for research and development services.    47.   To  meet the requirements of the  expansion programme, substantial orders have been placed for aircraft of the various types for  delivery over the  next  two or three years.    48.   Under measures initiated during  1938,  additional personnel totalling some  2,000  will have  been added to the Fleet Air Arm before  the  close of  the year,  and  in  1939,  as mentioned  in paragraph 37, an increase of 4,000 is  contemplated.    49.   This additional personnel is being  found by transfers from the Fleet and from  the R.A.F.,  as  well as by  new  entries from outside sources.   For some time to come, however,  the Fleet  Air Arm  must  continue,  particularly as regards flying personnel  andi skilled  ratings  for  maintenance  duties,  to  depend  largely  upon personnel lent from the  R.A.F., or trained at R.A.F. establishments.     50.   Under  the arrangements now  being introduced,  while  the Air Ministry  remain  responsible for  general flying training of  the Fleet Air Arm pilots, the Admiralty will shortly assume responsibility for specialised Naval  training.   For  this purpose,  for the  training
of disembarked  squadrons,  and for the repair and maintenance of aircraft that cannot be undertaken afloat, shore bases are required.Arrangements are being made with  the  Air  Ministry for the Navyto take over certain R.A.F. shore stations early in the forthcomingfinancial  year.   These  will  not, however,  be sufficient to  meet requirements, and it will be necessary to make up the  deficiency bothby the construction of new bases and by the use of R.A.F. stationson a  shared basis.    51.  Army. The  comprehensive  reorganisation of the RegularArmy, on the lines described by the Secretary of  State for War inhis speech  introducing the  Army  Estimates in  March  last,  has proceeded.    52.  The number of   anti-aircraft  divisions of  the  Territorial Army has been increased  from two to five, and the whole organized into  an  anti-aircraft  Command  under   a  Corps  Commander. Parallel with this re-organization of the  force, a new directorate was established in the War Office under the  control of a Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff  for coast defence and anti-aircraft.  In this directorate are  centred all questions  regarding training  and organization of the anti-aircraft  and coast defence.     53.   The  Field Force portion of the  Territorial  Army has been reorganized to  conform with the Regular Army.   Not only have all Arms been reorganised but  units, which have no counterpart in the Regular Army, such as motor cycle battalions, have been  formed.  The  higher organization  has  been  thoroughly  overhauled,  and  in  place of  the former  twelve divisions,  there are  now nine infantry  divisions,  three motor divisions, and mobile  brigades which  can be  organized into a  mobile  division in war.  In addition some horsed  units are being retained  to meet special conditions encountered in  certain  possible  theatres of war.   The Auxiliary  Territorial  Service  for women has also  been inaugurated and organized, and recruiting  is proceeding  satisfactorily.     54.  Royal Air Force. The strength of  the Metropolitan Force  has been increased both as regards number and power of aircraft: by  the 31st March, 1939, the number of first-line aircraft will have been  raised to  the figure of  1,750 for which  the programme due  for   completion at that date  provided.   This  was extended  by  the   programme announced in  May, 1938, for a Metropolitan first line   strength of approximately 2,370 aircraft,  an overseas strength of 500,   and the completion  of the expansion of the Fleet Air Arm.  Further,   as announced by the Secretary  of State  for Air  in the House of   Commons on the .10th November,  1938, His Majesty&apos;s  Government   has  decided  on  steps which would further  increase and accelerate   the programme.  During 1939 the expansion of the Royal Air Force   will be continued in accordance with these announcements.       55.  The  balloon  barrage scheme,  which was  started last year,   has now been extended to the provinces, and comprises 47 squadrons.
A  separate Command has been  formed for the  administration andtraining of these units,  although for  operational purposes they willremain  under the control of the Air Officer  Commanding-in-Chief,Fighter Command, who is  responsible for Air Defence as a whole.The balloon squadrons form part of the Auxiliary Air Force and arerecruited locally.  Recruitment for the provincial  units  began lastmonth.                               VII.                         CIVIL  DEFENCE.    56.  Organisation. Following  the crisis of  September, 1938,  itwas decided that the planning of Civil Defence, the co-ordination ofthe work of the various  Departments concerned  and the organizationof National Service in time of war, required the  whole  time attentionof a Minister of Cabinet rank.  A Minister for Civil Defence, holdingthe  -office  of  &quot;Lord  Privy  Seal,  was  accordingly  appointed  inNovember,  1938.    The Lord  Privy Seal  is  responsible  for  theco-ordination of policy on all aspects  of Civil  Defence.  In addition,he  has direct executive responsibility for the work of the Air RaidPrecautions Department of the Home Office.    57.  The  Air Raid  Precautions Department is responsible for settling the general principles  to be followed by local authorities andthe public  generally, in devising precautionary  measures against air raids, including protection and shelter against high explosive, gas and incendiary bombs, and  for advising local authorities and the  publicupon the carrying out of these measures.   It  deals with the detailedschemes submitted  by  local authorities,  with  whom the  statutoryresponsibility for initiating measures of local precautions  rests underthe Air Raid Precautions Act, 1937, and with various matters, such  asair raid warnings and lighting restrictions, which are dealt with on anational basis.   The  Department maintains  training  schools  andsupervises  local training carried out by local authorities, and supplies to local authorities and the public equipment and materials of various kinds  for  the  provision of which the  Government  have acceptedresponsibility.    58.  The  staff of the Air Raid Precautions Department has been substantially increased  in the last few months.  Further augmenta-tions may be required,  in order to ensure that  the Department is  ina position  to bear the great increase  in work  and responsibility withwhich it would have to  cope in the event of hostilities.  In pursuanceof  the  same policy,  the Department&apos;s regional  organisation is beinggreatly strengthened, a measure which will in due course facilitatea  substantial  measure  of  decentralisation.   In  place  of  a  ChiefInspector and  18 Regional Inspectors, a Chief Regional Officer  and  38Regional Officers, in three grades, are being appointed.  These  officers will be allocated among the  12 regions  into which  the country is
divided.  There will be in addition one or more Fire Brigade Inspee-tors  in  each region,  and in most regions there will be  a TechnicalInspector specially concerned with shelters and other precautions ofa structural character.   Special arrangements have been made for adminsitrative  staff to be stationed at Edinburgh, to enable  Scottishproblems to be handled, so far  as possible, on the spot.  A specialorganisation is also being set up to  deal  with London.   59.   The arrangements described in the foregoing paragraph are designed to link up with the local organisation which  would have tobe established in the event of war.  Effective provision must  be madefor  the contingency  of communication  with  the seat  of  Govern-ment being interrupted, and for that purpose it is proposed to have available in each  region representatives, to be designated  Commis-sioners, who would  be empowered  in case of need to  exercise full powers by  way of delegation from  the Central Government.   EachCommissioner would be authorised, subject  to  his  instructions,  toexercise all or any  of  the powers  of the executive Government  incivil matters if and so long as communications were cut off,  or  so seriously interrupted as to impede the despatch of vital  business.  Itis proposed that suitable  persons  should be  designated  in time  ofpeace  to  fill  these positions,  but  they  would  have  no  executive responsibility  in peace  time  and their  function  in  advance  of  an emergency  would be confined  to acquainting themselves as fully as possible  with  the  characteristics and personalities of  their Region and with the  organisation of Government services therein.     60.   It is desirable to make it  clear that  these arrangements do not in themselves affect in any way the functions oi. local authorities in  the matter  of  Civil  Defence.   The problem of   adjusting  to conditions of  war the machinery for the discharge of such  functions is an entirely separate  matter, which the Lord Privy  Seal has under- taken  to  discuss with representatives   of local  authorities  and  in relation to which he- is about  to communicate  with  the appropriate associations.     61.  Responsibility for various aspects of Civil  Defence  is  hot wholly concentrated in the Air Raid Precautions Department.  The aim in this matter has been to make  each Department responsible for those aspects of Civil Defence with which  its peace-time functions are most  closely allied.  The Ministers concerned act  in co-opera-  tion with  the Lord Privy Seal.  This arrangement makes for greater  efficiency  in time of peace, and would ease the strain on the Govern-  mental machine in the transition from  peace, to war.     62.  Thus the Ministry of Labour dea&apos;s with National Service, the  Ministry of Health (in respect of England and Wales) and the Depart-  rnent of Health for Scotland  (in respect of Scotland) are responsible  for schemes  of  evacuation, for emergency hospital services, and  for  approving proposals for first-aid posts  and  ambulance services sub-  mitted by local  authorities.  The Home Office and the  Scottish Office
deal with the war duties of the Police in England and Wales and inScotland-respectively.   The Food  (Defence Plans) Department of theBoard of Trade  acts  in  close  collaboration  with the  departments responsible  for  the various  aspects  of Civil Defence.   Air  raidprecautions  in schools  (other than questions of evacuation) are dealtwith by the Board of Education and the Scottish Education Depart-ment, in  respect of England and Wales and Scotland respectively.Transport arrangements in time of war  are  being organised by theMinistry of  Transport,  which is responsible for the railways, canals,road transport and docks and harbours.    63.  National  Service.&apos; The  campaign  for  Voluntary  NationalService was  launched in January,  1939, with the issue of the NationalService Guide of which 20,000,000 copies were printed and distributed tohouseholds  throughout  the country.  The  recruiting campaign  hasbeen  directed to the whole range of the Defence Services,  comprising the Regular Forces and their  Auxiliaries, and the several branchesof Civil  Defence.   At  the  same  time, there  was made available a provisional-  Schedule  of  Reserved  Occupations,  drawn up  by  theMinistry of -Labour, indicating those occupations in respect of which,in  the  general  national  interest, it  is  necessary that  restrictions should be placed in peace-time on  the  acceptance  of volunteers forcertain forms Of enlistment or enrolment for service in time of war.    64.   To  assist  the  recruiting  campaign,  National Service  Com-mittees were appointed  by the Minister of Labour in every  county and county borough in England and Wales, and in the counties and large burghs  of Scotland, to stimulate  the campaign for  focussing publicinterest on the whole question of National Service, and to arrange for advice and guidance to be  available to inquirers who might be in  doubt as to  what service they  could best  undertake.   A considerable numberof additional local committees  has also been  established to meet theneeds of smaller boroughs and other districts within the county areas.   -65.   In  so far as the requirements of Civil Defence are concerned,large  numbers  of  volunteers had  already come forward, particularlyduring  and subsequent  to the  crisis  of  September 1938;    but,before  the  National  Service  campaign was begun,  there was  aconsiderable shortage   of  volunteers in  particular areas, and  alsoshortages for  certain  services -in  particular  the Auxiliary  fire service.  It may  be anticipated that, as a result of action taken tobring to public attention the various services for which volunteers arerequired,  these deficiencies will  be made  good, and  an  adequatereserve also enrolled.    66.   Air Raid Precautions Services. Local authorities have beenactively engaged during the year with the preparation and organisationof their general Air Raid Precautions schemes. Generally, the  enrol-ment  of  volunteers has  proceeded satisfactorily.   The estimatedestablishment of volunteers for general Air Raid Precautions purposes for the whole  country is of the order  of 1,100,000.  This  makesallowance for organisation in reliefs and shifts, but not for reserves.Up to the end of December the  numbers, reported as enrolled were
about 1,150,000 and in most areas good progress had been made withtheir training for the various duties for which they had volunteered.Much  work has also been  done in  building  up the administrativemachine required for the work, in the organisation and distribution ofthe various branches of the service and in selecting the various sites and  depots from which they could operate.   67.   A form of steel shelter has been designed which  will afford,for dwellers  in the smaller types of house,  satisfactory  protection from blast, splinter and the fall of debris resulting from the explosion of high-explosive   bombs;  and  considerable  distribution of  theseshelters will  have  been made before  the end of March..  It is antici-pated that protection will thus be provided for 10,000,000 people.  Itis also proposed  to strengthen basements,  after  a survey  of thepremises  which can be dealt with in this way.   In, addition, the trenches which were constructed during the September crisis are beingmade permanent,  where they  are suitably  placed.  The expenditure involved by these measures will be  of the order of  20 millions.   68.  Plans have now been completed for finding  nearly  200,000beds in existing hospitals and institutions, within twenty-four hours ofa state of emergency being declared, by  sending patients  home andtransferring them  to other accommodation and by putting additionalbeds and equipment in the wards,  and for  finding about  another100,000 later by using ancillary parts of hospitals not at present used as wards.  For this purpose 50,000  beds  and mattresses have beenobtained and are already in process of distribution.  Orders have beenplaced for 200,000  blankets, and the Office of Works  has  been askedto obtain tenders  for  a  further large supply of beds,  mattresses,blankets and other bedding.  Plans have been made  also for linkinghospitals  in  war  time and are being discussed  with  the  hospital authorities concerned.   The Health Departments&apos;  Hospital  officers have listed  buildings  and land  adjoining  hospitals  suitable for expansion,  and plans  for  new hospital  units  are under  active consideration.   69.   The  Government  accepted the  recommendations  of  theCommittee on Evacuation  (Cmd.  5837)  in favour of the transfer,within the limits of the available  accommodation in less  vunerable areas,  from densely populated  and  vulnerable  areas of certain classesof persons who could be spared.  An  emergency scheme was prepared in September, and,  modified in the light of  the  experience thengained, could be put  into force at any time  when  required.   more detailed arrangements are in train, and in this connection a circularletter  was sent to all local  authorities  in  receiving areas on the5th January,  asking for an immediate  survey of available aecommo-dation.  The present plan  contemplates that provision wall be  madefor  the  evacuation of  school children,  under  the supervision of teachers and other helpers, and of young children with their mothers.
The situation  will be reviewed  in the  light  of  the  informationascertained from the survey.   70.  About 840 fire precautions schemes have been received fromthe local authorities in Great Britain, and 710 are settled or virtuallysettled.  In many  places the local measures are well advanced, butothers  are  more  backward.    Orders  have  been  placed   for approximatly  18,000  pumping appliances of  various types.  steps have been taken to accelerate the completion of this programme.    71,   By the end  of the year 40 million civilian respirators forthe public had been distributed to the  local authorities.  During the crisis  of  September  instructions were given   for their distribution to the public.&apos;  It was decided that for the time being those respiratorswhich had  been  distributed  to  the public should  remain in  their possession,  subject to  review  of  the  position  in six months&apos; time.Tn: the  meantime further stocks have  been  accumulated to  meetdeficiencies.    72.  Large orders  for  the various types of equipment requiredfor Air Raid Precautions personnel have been placed and  steps takento  accelerate delivery.  A substantial reserve of sandbags is being built  up and  is being  distributed  to  local authorities as deliveriescome  in.    73.  Discussions have taken place with electricity supply, gas and water undertakings and  also with the  railway companies and theLondon  Passenger Transport Board and the dock  and  harbour authorities, on the special measures which should be taken as a form of protection  against air attack  in the  case of these concerns, and on  the apportionment of cost  between the  Government and the undertakings.  Legislation will  shortly be introduced to make the necessary financial provision.    In the meantime the work of carrying out  the measures required, and  providing the necessary  equipment, is in hand.    74.   Arrangements are being  made to provide more intensive instruction for air raid wardens and others  in methods of  dealing with  incendiary bombs and elementary methods of protection against high explosives.   The instructors&apos;  courses at the Home Office schools have  already  been  extended for this  purpose.   New  or  revised syllabuses of instruction and other detailed  guidance in relation to the  training of Air  Raid  Precautions personnel are being issued to local authorities.                                VIII.                             CONCLUSION.     75.  The increase in the cost of  the programme, and the further  borrowing powers required, are  largely necessitated  by  the increase in  our defensive strength  to meet the  risk of air attack.   It is  every-  where  recognised that  our  armaments have  no aggressive  purpose.
His  Majesty&apos;s Government deeply deplore the need  for the  expen-diture of these vast sums on armaments.  They have already indicated that, when other nations are prepared to consider some arrangement for limitation of armaments, this country will be prepared to play its part.  But in the absence of a general reduction of armaments it is inevitable  that  this country  should  continue to  take  the steps necessary, in the light of present deyelopments, for its own  protection and  for the discharge of its responsibilities elsewhere.   76.  It follows that  in  these circumstances it  is not possible  togive  any precise  estimate of the  total cost of Defence measures overthe  period April 1937 to March 1942.   His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare  pressing forward with  the programmes outlined  in this  paper.They are  confident that the people of  this country will be ready  tobear the heavy burden involved,  and will share the determination  ofHis  Majesty&apos;s Government to  ensure the adequacy  of our defence preparations.   February 15,  1939.
