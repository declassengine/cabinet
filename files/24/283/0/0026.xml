This document  is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  G-overnm ent. Printed for the Cabinet, March 1939                         ^ n.--:------fact^SECRET                                                               COPY NO. g 3e.p. 53  (39)                               THE  cabinet proposals TO SECURE THE REMOVAL OF  A RESTRICTIVE UNDERTAKING AFFECTING  SERVICE  IN THE TERRITORIAL                                 ARMY     MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR WAR    I. It is  proposed to  revise undertakings, which have been  given to  the    9Territorial Army, of a kind  which restrict its usefulness in war.   The present general position is as follows :                                                           2911    2. Men  who  enlisted on  or before 31st October,  1933, and have  servedcontinuously since, were promised, as an explicit condition of agreement to serveoverseas, that they would continue to serve with their own  units.   This rightderives from the individual agreements signed by each man.    3. Men who enlisted after  31st  October,  1933, signed an  attestation paper,and an agreement, accepting liability to general service, i.e. to transfer to any unit,without qualification.  The force of this agreement, however, is  impaired by anundertaking contained in the Territorial Army Regulations that they will go over-seas with their own units.  To that extent it is not possible, without a breach ofthis undertaking, to transfer Territorial soldiers preparatory to sending TerritorialArmy units overseas.    4. Before the war the Territorial  Force, as it then was, was  a  home defence force, with an &quot; Imperial Service Section &quot; consisting of officers and men who hadvoluntary undertaken to serve  overseas in war, with a guarantee that  they  would serve only within their own units.  All Territorials who went overseas in the early part of the Great War went as  volunteers, subject to this undertaking, but in 1916the Military  Service Act of  that year  made  all Territorial personnel liable togeneral  service,  without  any  reserved rights.  This was done because in theconditions of war  service it was found impossible  to  ensure that  the originalguarantee was observed.    5. After the war, as a concession to Territorial Army sentiment, an under-taking in the sense explained  in paragraph 2 above was reintroduced, and  wasnot wholly removed in 1933, when it  was realized that in any future war similar difficulties would  again arise  to  those experienced in the  Great  War.   TheCouncil  of County Territorial  Associations  then agreed  to the complete abolitionof all restrictions on transfer, and, as  pointed  out above, the form  of  agreements for future entrants was suitably altered  to ensure a general service  liability.   Butthe Territorial Army Regulations still  continue to hold out an unqualified promise that men will be sent overseas  with their own units.     6. I propose to inform the House of Commons that while every effort will bemade  to preserve  the integrity of  units, it  will not be possible  to  ensure  that. every Territorial will  remain, until he goes overseas, with his original unit.  Theintention is  to carry out  the  promise as far as military exigencies allow, but inorder that  there  may be  a reasonable freedom in bringing up to  war  establish-ment the earlier Territorial Army  units to be sent overseas, transfers may be inevitable.   Each man will be  invited to agree to serve on the new  understanding.&quot;&apos;If there  are any men who  find themselves  unable to  accept the invitation to waive their rights, I would propose to give  them the option of taking theirdischarge.
    J. I would  also  mention  that  a proposal  has been  submitted to  theCommittee of Imperial Defence and approved* that &quot; the  personnel of all unitsof the Territorial Army (other than units  of Air Defence  of Great Britain  andCoast Defence) should now  be invited to  undertake an obligation to come upfor service  in emergency  when required by the Secretary  of  State  for War.The effect of this would  be that the whole  of the  Territorial Army would  be onthe same footing in this matter.&quot;    I propose to announce this invitation also at the same time.                                                                   L. H.-B.    THE WAR OFFICE,           24th February, 1939.* Paragraphs 14 and 15 of C.I.D. Paper 1526B, and Concl. 4 (c) of Minutes of 347th Meeting.(B39/8) 70 3/39  W.O.P. 2867
