AGRICULTURE (AMENDMENT) BILL.[emorandum by  the Minister of Agriculture           of State for Scotland.and the Secretarylo        At their meeting on the Sth February, 1939, theCabinet decided (Cabinet 6(39) Conclusion 12) that theintroduction of the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill, 1939, shouldbe postponed pending further consideration by the agricultural ministers and the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the proposalsfor an increased subsidy in respect of land under oats or barleyharvested in 1938.     This further examination has now takenplace and our views as to the course that should be followedare submitted for the approval of our colleagues.2.        The suggestion was made at the last meeting of theCabinet that, instead of a temporary Bill providing for additional assistance to growers of bailey of the 1938 crop, theproposed long-term policy should be applied retrospectively tothe barley crop of 1938.    The long-term proposals for oats and barley that the Cabinet Committee on Agricultural Policyprovisionally approved as a basis for discussion with the FarmersUnions were briefly as follows:-    (a) BARLEY.  Barley is grown in this country for two purposesAbout 60 to 80 per cent, of the crop is normally sold formalting and the remainder is either sold for feeding tolivestock at an appreciably lower price or is used for thatpurpose on the farm on which it is grown.  Because of this dualnature the long-term policy contemplates that the brewing anddistilling industries should be responsible for guaranteeing aminimum price for that part of the crop which is used for maltingpurposes, and that the remainder which is not so sold should                          1.
receive an Exchequer subsidy on an acreage basis.    The receiptof wheat deficiency payments would not be a disability for either form of assistance.     (b) OATS.   In this case it is proposed to pay a subsidy on an acreage basis with a differentiation in the scale of subsidy payments according to whether or not the grower decidesto receive deficiency payments in respect of any wheat that .he&quot;may have grown.3.        The long-term proposals for barley will necessitate theintroduction of a system of certificates and a record of allsales of barley for malting purposes somewhat similar to those now in operation for wheat under the Wheat Act.   It will obviously be impracticable to obeain certificates in respect of sales of the 1938 ci^op which have already taken place and forthis reason the proposed long-term policy could not be appliedretrospectively to  the barley crop of 1938.4.        Consideration has therefore been given to thepossibility of including in new lev - term legislation a specialplan for the 1938 crop of ba -ley alone which would, so far aspossible,  be in accord with  .he principle of that part of thelong-term policy applicable to barley &quot;sed for feeding.   In theabsence of ascertained prices for sales of barley for feeding itwould be necessary  either to fix an arbitrary flat rate per acre or to e.se prices of oats, as in the Agriculture Ac.;-, 1937,a course which can be justified by the riose comparison betweenreported market prices for oats and feeding barley.   PourXoossible alternatives preseriu themselves     (a)  A s-ibsidy cf  1 per acre as in the presenttemporary Bill,  but removing the wheatdisability which has been the subject of very strong criticism.Th i s wo uld cost about  1,000,000.(b)The adoption of the proposals put forward inthe Autumn by the Conservative agricultural committee of the House of Commons for atemporary subsidy of  1 per acre on all barleyv/ith a bonus of 5s. per acre where wheat
       deficiency payments are not taken.     The cost                                                               JL d       would be approximately  1,100,000,   (c) The payment of an acreage subsidy on all barley based       on the average yield per acre (approximately 16 cwt.) and       the difference between a standard price of 8s, per cwt.       (as in the Agriculture Act, 1937) and the anticipated       average United Kingdom price of oats of 5s.l0d, per cwt.       This would involve a subsidy of 34s.8d. per acre and       would cost about  1,700,000.   (d) The adaptation to barley, for the year 1938 only, of       the proposed long-term policy for oats, which could       readily he applied retrospectively.    The liability of       the Exchequer would be about  800,000.The above sums are inclusive of the subsidy of  101,000 alreadypayable under the Agriculture Act-, 1937.5.      Any of the above plans, if unaccompanied by any additional assistance for the 1938 oats  crop, would undoubtedlyraise strong objection from growers of oats in Scotland, whowould doubtless urge that their need, in view of the very low prices realised for sheep in Scotland concurrently with thedepression in the prices pf oats, is just as great as that oftheir brother farmers in many parts of England ,vkore sheep and barley are the main source of the farmer&apos;s Incomes    Theannouncement of policy made by the late Minister of Agricultureon December 9th, 1938, in which an increased temporary subsidywas proposed for barley, also included a statement that thescale of assistance for oats and feeding barley would be reviewed, and this statement seems to have raised hopes among thegrowers of oats in Scotland that there was a possibility ofadditional assistance also being given in respect of the 1938crop of oats.6.      We have, therefore,  reached the conclusion that inthe light of the existing political situation and in order to
ensure a favourable reception to our long-term proposals it isessential that if additional assistance for the 1958 crop of barley is to be proposed retrospectively in a long-term bill which will contain revised plans for the future for both oats and barley, a similar measure of assistance must also beprovided for oats.   &apos;/ife suggest,, therefore, that the new schemeof assistance for oats should be retrospective and - since  itwill not be possible to make retrospective the long-term proposalsfor barley - that it should also be applied to the 1958 crop of barley.   The reason for this different iat ton between theretrospective measure of assistance for barley and the long-term proposals can be readily explained when the policy is announced.The application of these proposals to the two crops would thenbe as follows:-     (a)  OATS.  For the 1958 crop the subsidy that will become payable in April next under existing legislation (part II of the agriculture act, 1937), to growers of oats who have elected not to receive wheat deficiency payments will be about 13s. per acre.   This is  six times the difference between the standard price  of 8s,. per cwt. fixed bythe Act, and the estimated average market  price.    (The figure sixwas taken to represent the number of hundredweight s per acre which,on the average ever the whole country, is  sola off the farm.   Theaverage total yield per acre is 16 cwt v)   The proposal now underconsideration for the future is that growers of oats who do elect toreceive wheat deficiency payments should;, be entitled to receive a subsidy on their oats calculated as above  and that for those gro -ersof oats who either grow no wheat or elect  not to receive wheat deficiency payments the multiple should be changed from six to twelve  (on the grounds that in those cases - notably in Scotland.  -the oats crop  is the  staple cereal crop)..   Applying these  proposalsretrospectively to the 1938 crop would, give the following result  -
1,427,000 acres already qualified under  the    Agriculture Act, 1957,  for a subsidy of                  13s., per acre (including additional  appli-    cations as proposed in paragraph 8 below)        927,500Subsidy on this acreage will be doubled,    making an additional    ,,,                 ^00   927,5001,014,000 acres farmed by growers who have    elected to receive wheat deficiency    payments, who would receive 13s, per acre   ,00   659,100?0TAL        2,514,100The acreage of oats on each farm is already known from thestatutory returns made in June last and payments of the additionalsubsidy could be made on that basis;     (b) BARLEY,  Under the Agriculture Act, 1937, the amountof subsidy that will become payable in April next for the 1938crop of barley    th0se growers who have elected not to receivewheat deficiency payments will be about 10sa per acre.  Themethod of calculation is similar to that described above foroats but since the qualifying acreage of barley exceeded thestandard acreage laid down in the Agriculture Act, a proportionate reduction in the subsidy falls to be made..          It was proposed in the Agriculture (Amendment) Billto raise the figure of 10s. to  1 (still in respect only ofthose growers who had elected not to receive wheat deficiency round)o          If payments are made in respect of the 1938 barleycrop on the basis proposed for oats, the result would be asfollows:-  227,000 acres already qualified under the                       Agriculture Act, 1937 for a subsidy of      10so per  acre (including additional appli-      cations as proposed in paragraph 8 below)    0 = 0   113,500  The &quot;standard acreage&quot; provision of the      Agriculture Act -will be removed, invelving      an additional subsidy of 3s, per acre on      this acreage    000    ,00   0*0   coo   000   3 .    34,000  The 13sc per  acre subsidy on this acreage will      be doubled, making an additional       0=0   .o0   147,500  810,000 acres farmed by growers who have      elected to receive wneat deficiency      payments, and who would receive      13s. per  acre         ,,,0         000   * o o        525,500                                           TOTAL        8 21,500                            5 o                        =========
7.        Some provision musk be made for dealing with mixedcorn which, under the Agriculture Act, is eligible for subsidyaccording to the proportion of oats and/or barley in the seedsmixture,     At present the applicant is required to make adeclaration as to his seeds mixture, but as the long-term proposals may not become law until July next, it is possiblethat some farmers will be unable to state with any exactitude--so long after the event the proportions of oats and barleythat were used in their seeds mixtures, for 1938.     Theywill, however, know whether the mixed corn comprised only oats and barley or whether the crop consisted, as is sometimes thecase, of oats and beans.     In the former case the composition of the mixture will be. immaterial if subsidy is paid  Iat the same rate for both cereals, as is proposed, and in thelatter case it could be assumed -that either half the mixtureconsisted of oats or that the normal proportions for suchmixed crops were used.    Allowance for mixed corn has beenmade in the estimates in the previous paragraph.8.        The policy statement of December 9th, 1938, included a promise that a further opportunity to apply for the proposedadditional subsidy for barley would be afforded to growers(a) whose applications were too late or had been rejectedthrough failure to comply with necessary formalities and(b) who had failed to apply.     Some 24*000 acres of barleyare involved, the growers of which, unless special provision ismade, would lose about 7s. per acre under the proposals outlined above.   It would, therefore, in our view, be necessary toprovide that growers of both barley and oats - similar facilities could not reasonably be withheld from growers of oatswho for any reason failed to apply  in June, 1938 or whoseapplications were disallowed - coming within the categoriesmentioned and who have not received wheat def ic iency-payments,should be treated as if  they were growers whose applicationshave already been accepted for subsidy under the provisionsof  the Agriculture Act,  1937.     This will mean that approximately 180,000 additional acres of barley and oats willqualify for  the higher rate  of 26o. per acre proposed.                         6.
 9.     Under these  proposals  oats  and. o-arley Trill r-e-ce-ive the  same  rate of  subsidy for  the 1938 crop, whereas under the long-term plans  it  is  proposed  that barley should receive a higher scale of assistance  in that the whole crop will benefit, and  not merely a  proportion - i,e. six-sixteenths or twelve- sixteenths-as for oats.   It  will be  obvious, however, that it will not  be  possible to  apply the long-term barley plan retrospectively,  and the  1938 grower  will receive considerably more than he would  have  done  under the Agriculture Act, 1937, or under the Agriculture  (Amendment) Bill, 1939. 10.  .  Our conclusions are that since it is proposed to produce in the near future revised permanent plans for the assistance of oats  and barley it would be undesirable to proceed with the  Agriculture (Amendment) Bill, and that the permanent plans, when  they  have been completed, should be applied retrospectively,  so far as practicable, to the 1938 crops ofboth oats and barley.   The permanent plans are, as our colleagues will be aware, still under consideration, but sufficient progress has been made to enable us to indicatebroadly in this Memorandum what would be the effect of suchretrospective provision,  on the assumption that proposals onthe mines of  those now under consideration are eventuallyapproved.    The position may be summarized as follows:-       Oats Growers.

                DRAFT   ANNOUNCEMENT.       ASSISTANCE   FOR  BARLEY  SgBBBf  CROP  OF  1938.          The  Government have given further consideration tothe  proposed additional subsidy to be paid to growers of barleyof the 1938 crop which was announced on 9th December last.Since  then a general review of the agricultural situation hasbeen undertaken and is now the subject of discussion withrepresentatives of the farming industry.   This general viewhas  included the review of the degree of assistance afforded tofeeding barley  and oats under the Agriculture Act,  1937,mentioned in the concluding portion of the announcement of9th December.          The conclusion has been reached that these subsequentdevelopments have materially changed the position;   and theGovernment now  propose that when the long-term policy forbarley and oats has been finally settled it should be appliedretrospectively, as far as is practicable,  to both thesecereals in respect of the 1938 crops.    No  temporary legislation authorising an  increased rate of subsidy for the 1938 crop of barley will therefore be introduced,  as was originally contemplated,  and in the meantime growers of barley and oatswhose applications have been accepted will,  at the appropriate time, be paid the subsidy to which they are entitled underthe provisions  of the Agriculture Act,  1937.    The sums sopaid will be treated as advances of whatever revised subsidypayments are finally decided upon under the proposedretrospective  provisions of the long-term legislation forthese cereals.
