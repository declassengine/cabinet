The labour aspect  of the problem  of a Ministry ofSupply in peace has been  considered by the Minister ofLabour and a memorandum by him is  attached as an Appendix.The general advantages and disadvantages of a Ministry    of Supply.2.     The main advantage of a Ministry  of Supply is tosecure the fullest advantage from  purchases in bulk andto avoid competition  between the three Service departments in the fields of productive capacity, raw materials, andsup ly of labour - particularly skilled  labour.    Thiscompetition is now intensified by  the addition of therequirements of the civil departments concerned in civil defence and air raid  precautions.       A further advantage of a Ministry of Supply isthat if a situation should arise in which it is necessaryto create as rapidly  as it can be  done a large increase inproductive capacity,  by reason, for instance,  of a decision-1-
to make a big expansion of the land forces, the type of organisation and personnel required is rather that character-istic of the Ministry of Munitions, than that normally avail-able in Government Departmentso3o     A main disadvantage of a Ministry of Supply is that itmust inevitably break the proper chain of responsibility fromthe user through the designer to the producer.   This, inregard to the major articles of service supply, is a very serious disadvantage, the effects of which can only be minimised bysuitable safeguards, but cannot be entirely overcome, and may affect one Service more than anothercIs a Ministry of Supply necessary jn time of War (or in time ofPeace. )4.     The necessity for a Ministry of Supply in war must beconsidered in relation to the probable situation at the outbreakof war in each of the Service Departments, as regards productivecapacity, supply of raw materials, and supply of labour.       Any large increase under these headings due either to aninsufficient war potential created in peace, or to a possiblelarge expansion in war, must we think necessitate a Ministry ofSupply.5.     As regards the Admiralty we understand that the productivecapacity for the first year&apos;s requirements has, generally speaking,been planned and allocated and that there is not a wide marginbetween the capacity that would become available and that whichwill be required.        In respect of labour, however, recent reports indicate thatthe present decline in mercantile shipbuilding has reduced theavailable skilled labour in that industry below the level whichwould be necessary to meet Admiralty requirements for the smallertypes of vessels, such as minesweepers, patrol vessels, trawlers,etc., in addition to the building of merchant ships on the scale which the Admiralty consider is sure to be necessary in war.
       The question of the maintenance of the shipbuilding industry, to which the Admiralty attach the highest importance,is however allied to that of the shipping industry itself, andis under separate consideration.60     The Air Ministry anticipate that the rate of airframeproduction which they have planned to reach could be doubledin some 12 months, without increase of floor space or machinetoe Is o   B.y the beginning of 1940 they will have developed a peace potential on a one-shift basis with considerable overtime-,of approximately half their full war potential   In general terms, the expansion in war would be carried out by increasingthe number of shifts, but the new shift would have to be train-ed, and the full effect on production would not be felt for aperiod of, say, 12 month so       As regards air engines, production is now running at therate of about 1,000 a month, labour being employed, by one ofthe two large engine producers up to a.bout 75 per cent, sxi&amp;, bythe other, up to about 50 per cent-., of the maximum capacityobtainable on a double shift plus overtime basis.   This rateof production would have to be lifted in war to over 3,000 amonth and even  that figure must be exceeded when the largemulti-engined bombers come into production in the years 1941/2.       The position may be summarised as follows.    The AirMinistry have succeeded in ensuring a really remarkableexpansion of supply, but a considerable further expansion isstill required before they are on terras with the heavy require-ments under their war hypothesis as given to the&quot;Supply Organ-isail on of the Committee of Imperial Defence.   Thus, as regardsthe two main articles of supply, air frames and air engines, avery large further expansion of production would be required inwar, and there is a similar need for further expansion inregard to other articles of supply, such as light alloys,turrets, instruments and air screws.7.          As regards the Army, proposals to increase
 the war potential  to provide  for  two contingents (2 mobile and 8  infantry  divisions)  have, heen approved in principleo If  the further  expansion of capacity made requisite  by  this  approval  can be created by the time war breaks out, the War Office  problem will be greatly eased. The only issue  for the Army would be created should the circumstances of the war  demand later material expansion of the land forces to  be  maintained in the field. 8.        The Civil Departments concerned in civil defence and air raid  precautions  are  to some extent interested in stores the production  of  which might come into competition with munitions  production, and are largely interested in what have been  termed &quot;quarter-master general stores&quot;  -  such as beds and beading for hospitals, clothing for  Air Raid  Precautions and so forth.  We deal with these stores  later in  this memorandum. Summary of situation regarding productive capacity,      raw, materials and : supply  of  labour. 0e  Productive Capacity.    So far  as concerns productive ^capacity,  provided that the Air Ministry  and War Office  had completed  arrangements in peace for the productive capacity required  in war, we  should suppose that serious conflict is not  likely to arise between the Service Departments.  Conflicthowever,  would be likely to arise  if this position had  not been reached in peace, or if and when the  Army had  to be materially expanded during war.10.  Raw Materials,  It  is  the approved policy  that  the  controlcf raw materials shall  be  exercised through the approvedMinistry for  the control, and  supply as necessary, of raw or partly  finished materials and  ^^articles of common userby  the  Service Departments.  This Ministry will be set
up at the outbreak of war either as a separate Ministryor5 if a Ministry of Supply is set up. as part of thelatter.11.  Labour.  There remains the labour aspect of the-, problem in which connection we draw attention to the Memorandumby the Minister of Labour attachea. as, an Appendix.   Thesupxoly of skilled engineering labour is alreaoy creatingdifficulties, which call for wide application of theprinciple of sub-contracting, and hence of taking thework to labour, rather than the labour to work.  TheMinister.of Labour has emphasised that these difficulties are materially increased so long as three separateDepartments are competing in the labour market.  further the Minister points out that no central authority exists for the co-ordination of rates of wages, while complaints of the &quot;poaching&quot; of labour are increasing.          We have no wish to belittle these difficulties and they would undoubtedly be intensified in war.          We feelj however, that unless it is consideredthat a Ministry of Supply is required to preventcompetition in the whole field of productive capacity,the establishment of such a Ministry cannot be justifiedsolely on the labour issue.  We suggest that the labourproblem per se could be adequately dealt with by aCo-ordinating Committee presiaed over by a Minister, onwhich the three Service Departments and the Ministry ofLabour would be represented.  This arrangement hasalready been agreed to by the Committee of Imperial       *Defence.The immediate problem.12.       We have however to face the possibility that        * C.I.D. 309th Mtg., Minute l(d) .
v/ar may break out so soon that we may, when it breaks out,still be in a position necessitating a further largeexpansion of Air Ministry supply, to say nothing ofsupply requirements for existing land forces for whichsupply on a war footing will not be available under existing Cabinet authority, or for a further expansion ofexisting land force so   Further we must face the possibilityof a serious dislocation of industry by air attack at theoutbreak of war which would reduce both output and productive capacity,.   The conclusion we draw is that theonly safe course is to make full pre arations for settingup a Ministry of Supply in war, though we -think that adecision whether and, if so, when, it should be set up should be deferred until after the outbreak of war0Functions and Scope of the Ministry of Supply in War.13.    Before preparations can be initiated for theestablishment of the Ministry of Supply in war, certaindecisions as to its scope and functions must be given,The points requiring decision are those set out inparagraph 4 of Sir Thomas Inskip&apos;s Memorandum CP. 33(59).14.    The first of these points is whether theAdmiralty should be included in a Ministry of Supply, ifestablished.   This was a point of acute controversy whenthe establishment of the Ministry of Munitions was underconsideration, it continued to be so right through thewar, and it has been the subject of continuous discussionever since0       The main argument in favour of including theAdmiralty is that the essential advantage of a Ministryof Supply is that it concentrates in the hands of a singleMinister the whole responsibility for supply in its relation to productive capacity and labour,.   If theAdmiralty is excluded, that advantage considerablydisappears, and the Admiralty is left in a position of                           -6-
independence which by reason of its long assuredposition and its potent influence over such mainindustries as the steel industry means that, Whateverdecisions as to the priorities be taken, the Admiraltywill in fact obtain advantages highly detrimental to the vital needs of other departments and particularly of theAir Ministry.   It is argued that this was demonstratedin the last war.15.    The main argument against including the Admiraltyis that the chain of responsibility - user, designer,producer -, which must be broken if a Ministry of supply is established, is of the utmost importance in the naval service, and that accordingly this principle is so deeplyembedded in the.whole system of organisationdof theAdmiralty, both on the staff side and that of material and personnel, that the transfer of the branches responsiblefor supply design and research to another Ministry would put the whole machine completely out of gear.       It is also urged as an argument againstincluding the Admiralty, at all events at the outset ofwar, that the Admiralty&quot;will not have to face problems of expansion of industrial capacity such as the Air ministry will, and the jar Office may, have to face should warbreak out in the near future.16.    Y/e have had to consider in each case (i.e.  (a)the arguments for and (b) the arguments against),  the weight of the various factors above enumerated, therelative seriousness of ignoring them, whether they would inevitably arise, and whether they could more or less be overcome.       &apos;v/e are advised for instance that, in war, mattersof conflicting interests may arise on occasional major
                                                      lit)issues and also on frequent minor issues.       So far as the major issues are affected, these would in all probablility he beyond the decision of theMinistry of Supply and would have to go at least to theCabinet Y7ar Priority Committee, if not to the cabinet itself.   Such questions would be those in which thedecision could considerably affect the Ship or Aircraftbuilding plans or an expansion of the Army.    The minorquestions are likely to be those as regards conflictingmaterial requirements for Special Steels etc.  ^ We areinformed that there is no great likelihood of these beingfrequent or unsolvable in other ways.   On the other hand the disadvantages of separating the two Admiraltyadministrative sides of Staff (or user) and personnel from the Design and production side could not really be overcome hy any special a.rrangements, on account of theinterlocked chain of responsibility in ship design andequipment.17.    We therefore reach the conclusion that theAdmiralty would have to be excluded from a Ministry ofSupply set up in war, unlesr. and until war experience showed that this exclusion resulted in such serious disadvantages, that the decision would have to bere considered.    The plans for the Ministry of supply should be drawn up so as to allow for this possibility.       On the other hand, the main case for the establish-ment of a Ministry of Supply in time of war arises fromthe probable or possible need for a great expansion ofproduction for the Air Ministry or the War Office afterthe outbreak of war, and a conflict  of needs between them,inwhich case it would be apparent that both Departments shouldbe  included in the Ministry of  . Supply from the outset.       The decision to include the War Office and Air
Ministry in the Ministry of Supply will involve a break inthe chain of responsibility of the Departments from userthrough the designer to the producer.  This is undoubtedly a serious disadvantage, particularly, perhaps, as regardsthe Air Ministry.  We therefore recommend that suitablesafeguards should be introduced in order to limit so far aspossible the resulting disadvantages, and to ensure thatthe interests of the user are not sacrificed arbitrarily tothe needs of production.  We attach considerable importanceto these safeguards being worked out in time of peace.          If the Civil Departments should, as the resultof war conditions, put forward large demands for thoseforms of supply which fall within the scope of the proposedMinistry of Supply, we recommend that those demands shouldlikewise be dealt with by the Ministry.          We think it would be far better to reach adecision on the above broad principles now, when we have more time for mature deliberation, rather than to leave them to be settled in the confused atmosphere of war.18.       A further point for decision is whether all forms of supply should be handed over to the Ministry ofSupply.  In our opinion the Ministry should be responsiblefor only those forms of supply which call for extensivediversion of the engineering, chemical and metallurgicalindustries from their normal spheres, and not for other more general forms of supply, as, for example, what maybe termed &quot;quarter-master general stores&quot;.  Demands forthe latter, as for example food stuffs and goods made ofleather, wool, cotton and so forth, which will probablybe the subject of control in war, must be co-ordinated,and we recommend that the Agency Purchase system whichobtains in peace should be continued in both service and
 civil  departments in war j and-co-oruination ensured by the  Contracts Co-ordinating Committee. 19o       Allied to the functions of supply are inspection,  design and research.  The experience of the last war  showed that, if supply is transferred, inspection and  design must be transferred with it and the relation between design and research is often so close that we think  both will have to be transferred.  Incidentally we should anticipate some difficulty as to deciding allocation of existing staff if design were transferred and  research left behind in the Air Ministry and War: Office. 20.       We have then to decide the extent of the compulsory powers which are to be given to the Ministry of Supply.   In our View, however desirable it may be, it would  be  impossible to enforce compulsory powers over labour in the political conditions of this country.  TheMinistry  must, however, be armed with compulsory powers to requisition productive capacity, and these are already given  in  the draft :Defence Regulations, which will be brought into operation under the Emergency powers (Defence) Bill.; at the outbreak of war.          Legislation for the setting up of newMinistries,  (for example, the Ministry of Material Resources, the^Ministry of Information and so forth) is already prepared in draft form, ana the Ministry of Supply could also be included. Necessity for a Ministry of Supply in peace. 21.       In previous paragraphs (4 - 20) we have
dealt with  the  question  of  establishing a Ministry ofSupply  in time  of  war;   we  now turn  to the questionwhether a Ministry of  Supply  is necessary in peace.        The  main arguments advanced for the establishmentof a Ministry of Supply  in  peace  are firstly, that itis desirable to avoid  the dislocation which might result if the  Ministry were established  on  or after theoutbreak of war, and secondly that a single Ministryof Supply would be in  a  position  to  survey the wholefield of supply and thus more effectively organiseproductive  capacity and  ensure an adequate supply and appropriate use of labour^        As regards  the  first contention, we considerthere need  be no material dislocation, if properpre-arrangements for the establishment of the Ministryat the  outset of war,  or as soon  after as seems desirable,  are, as we  propose, prepared fully and inconsiderable detail in peace.   ,/e add our suggestionson this  point later in this Memorandum.       As regards  the  co-ordination  of labour demands,we have  already expressed our view in paragraph 11 thata Ministry  of Supply would be in  no better positionto deal  with these  questions than a  suitably constitutedCommittee.22.     Further, we  feel  that it is so important tomaintain the chain of  responsibility and co-ordinationrunning  from user  to the designer and the producer that
the establishment  of a Ministry  of Supply  should be postponed,  even  in w.-.r,  unless and until there are very strong advantages  to be  gained by setting  it up.    Thepresent relations  between  the three service departments and productive industry  are highly developed and most satisfactory.    No advantage which would compensate for any break in these relations would be  gained by  the setting up  of a  Ministry of supply.       A further very strong argument against theestablishment of a Ministry of Supply is that, in theconditions  of Government Departments as they existto-day, that measure would, in our judgment, cause -a delay in executing the rearmament programme which atthis of all times  is unacceptable.   It. is difficult to assess this delay  in weeks or months and we feel it willbe generally agreed that- delay oughi^district to be--c-ontemplatej3at all.       We are therefore  averse to the establishment^or t\Ministry of Supply in peace.Preparations for a Ministry of Supply in Var,23. .   There is  first of. all the problem of location.The question where the service Departments should go,if compelled to  leave London, is at present, we. understand.^under active consideration, as is also the question  of the location of the Ministry of Material Resources when  setup.   Further a  priority organisation attached totheCabinet Office itself is an essential part of the War
i o. n1 0 usupply organisation already approved.   It appears to  us that? if the decision of the Cahinet is that a Ministryof Supply may have to he established in War, thatdecision will have to he taken as a most important factor in settling these questions of location, if the  move  from london has to be made,  If this is not done there is  a risk that the Supply Branches of the Defence Departments,which would form the nucleus of the Ministry of  Supply,might find themselves locatea in widely separated partsof the country   If this happened it would involve serious delay and difficulty in setting up the Ministryof Supply.24.  -     We have already referred to the question oflegislation for the setting up of the Ministry in war.There are, however, other steps and preparations whichshould be made at a very early date.  These comprisethe general lay-out of the organisation, the earmarkingof personnel both from the government service and from outside sources and the detailing of those branches ofthe War Office and&apos;Air Ministry which will be transferredto the Ministry.                                  &apos;.25.       We suggest that the responsibility for thesepreparations should be immediately centralised in theChairman of the Supply Board with the assistance of\asuitable staff specially detailed for the purpose.Any questions needing Ministerial decision woula bereferred by him to a Committee of the Ministers  concerned.Summary of Recommendations.                           \26.       We summarize our recommendations as follows:-          (i)  A Ministry of Supply should not be set                  up in peace.
1 a 2   (ii)All  preparations should &quot;be made at once         for the setting up of a  Ministry of         Supply in time of war.   These comprise         the lay-out of the organisation, ^he         earmarking of personnel and the detailing         of branches which would be transferred         to the Ministry.   These preparations         should be centralised in the Chairman         of the Supply Board, who would be supplied         with a special staff for the purpose.         Any questions needing Ministerial decision         would be referred by him to a committee         of the Ministers concerned .  (iii)   A decision whether,  and, if so, when,          a Ministry of  Supply would  be  set          up  in war should be deferred&apos; until          the onset of an emergency.   (iv)  The Ministry of Supply should be         responsible for supply for the War         Office and the Air Ministry, but not         for the Admiralty unless and until         the strqsses  of war compel its         inclusion;  suitable safeguards for         the &quot;user&quot; must be enforced,,   -(v-)-.The Ministry of Supply  should be         responsible  only for those parts of         Supply which  call for extensive         diversion of  the engineering, chemical         and metallurgical indiisiries&quot;-from         their normal-  sjpheres.   (vi)-The supply of  common stores should be         arranged &quot;by Departments  under the         existing system,  with a suitable         Committee, such as the Contracts         Co-ordinating Committee, for         co-ordination.  (vii)  The functions  of design and research,         and of inspection,  should be         transferred as well as the functions         of supply,,(viii)  Compulsory powers for the Ministry over-         labour are not -practicable.(initialled)  C.richmond Terrace,  S.W.I. 21st  February,  1939.
                        APPENDIX               A MINISTRY OF SUPPLY IN PEACE.            MEdORd-NDUrf BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.1.     The follov/ing memorandum sets out the need for aMinistry of supply in peace from the aspect of labour supply.2.     LABOUR SUPPLY.(a)  The unemployed.       The reserves of unemployed skilled engineering labour are practically exhausted.   The Ministry of Labour estimate,on the basis of an enquiry made in September last that, outof a total of some 74,500 males registered as unemployed inthe engineering group of industries, there are only about,300 unemployed skilled men fit for immediate employment intheir respective occupations.   Of this 8,300 the numberconsidered capable of working to fine limits is about 2,400only.   The position to-day is roughly the same.   Moreover, forthe most part these men are not mobile.   some of them have good prospects of early employment in their own localities (theregister never stands still;  there is a continual turn-over).Others are married men with family responsibilities, houses which they have bought, or are buying, and so on.       in so far, therefore, as skilled labour is required, itis useless to look for an expansion of armament production byrecruitment of labour from the ranics of the unemployed.       There are considerable reserves of unemployed unskilled labour, much of which is adaptable, given short periods oftraining either in the factories or in the Government TrainingCentres, to semi-skilled repetition processes.       Little or no demand has yet been made upon the reserves of female labour.   The Trade Unions would stoutly oppose any considerable increase in the employment of women unless it could
be clearly demonstrated that there was no practicable alternative.   This cannot yet be done.   in any case, femalelabour could only be employed in the main on unskilled or semi-skilled work.(b) The Employed.       In July 1933 the total number of insured males in theengineering, motor vehicle, cycle and aircraft group in GreatBritain was 1,110,510.   Deducting the numbers unemployed, ..this means that the number of males in employment in this group at the present time.is about 1,030,000, of whom it isestimated that between 400,000 and 500,000 are skilled men.       It has recently been estimated, and the EngineeringEmployers&apos; Federation do not dissent, that armament workabsorbs only about 35 per cent, of the labour employed bytheir members.   Allowing for the facts that many of the largeprofessional armament firms are members of the Federation, andthat many engineering firms, some of considerable importance,are not members, it is clear that outside the professionalarmament firms the proportion of labour in the engineering.group of industries employed upon armament work must be small.There remains, therefore, a considerable reserve of skilled labour and machine capacity in the engineering industry as a.whole.3.     C0NCLU3I0IT3.(1) Work Spreading and heed for Centralised Control.       The conclusions from the above . considerations is that ifdeficiencies are to be made good more rapidly and war potentialto be built up, it will be necessary to spread the work to amuch greater extent than has already been done.   This is themethod which had to be adopted in the last war and would necessarily have to be adopted immediately on the outbreak of
                                                           1 p,i                                                           J. U &apos;is a war in the future, and much has already been done in this direction with considerable success, especially by the Air Ministry.        As from last July the Air Ministry have taken power in all their contracts to enforce a measure of sub-contracting up to Sb%, as a minimum, of the production measured in man-hours, this policy to apply on a voluntary basis to contracts then&apos; running.    Until recently sub-contracting in the aircraft industry had no definite regional basis, but the Air Ministry are now making the foundation of their future policy the regional organisation for sub-contracting by each main contractor.        The Advisory panel of industrialists in their letter of 31st January to the prime Minister state that they are glad to note that the principle of sub-contracting and of taking work to labour, rather than the reverse process, is being widely adopted and they consider that the use of this principle should be extended whenever practicable.   It is, however, doubtful whether this policy can be pursued to the fullest effective extent over the whole field of armament production so long as there are thrue separate Departments competing with each other, A Ministry of Supply could more effectively apportion the work to be done over the whole range of armament supplies to those organisations and individual firms whose machine capacity and technical ability are suited to the manufacture of particular items.   It could also tame steps to ensure that&apos;the demands made upon any particular firm were proportioned to the firm&apos;s productive capacity without overloading.   This applies particularly in the case of sub-contracts and would avoid the present difficulty of sub-contractors failing to keep to their promised delivery dates through having accepted orders, in some

It could also taice steps to ensure that the demands made upon airy particular firm were proportioned to the firm&apos;sproductive capacity without overloading.   This applies particularly in the case of sub-contracts and would avoid thepresent difficulty of sub-contractors failing to keep to theirpromised delivery dates through having accepted orders, in some
cases from other Government Departments,  far beyond their capacity to handle.   This kind of failure will occur with increasing frequency? in the absence of centralised control,if it should become necessary rapidly to increase the outputof armaments.       A Ministry of Supply will prevent three separateService Departments each carrying out its own enquiries intothe ability of individual firms to produce the goods required,and will avoid firms being approached by each of the three departments, and other cases being overlooked altogether.(2).  Wages and profits.       The wages situation in the engineering industry shows signs of getting out of hand/   The pace is being set by theaircraft industry, in which the rising wage rates and largeearnings are beginning to be a serious embarrassment to therest of the engineering Industry,   &quot;poaching&quot; of labour is increasing, and complaints are new reaching the Ministry ofLabour that firms engaged on armament work are &quot;poaching&quot; frwmeach other.   Thus wage rates, costs of production, and profits(where they are calculated as a fixed percentage on turn-over)are all forced up together with no equivalent increase in production.       public attention is being directed to the very largeprofits being made in the manufacture of armaments, and in theaircraft industry in particular.   This is a subject which will undoubtedly be the target of political attack in the forth-coming session of Parliament.       The advantages of a Ministry of Supply in dealing withthese matters have been cogently stated by the Sub-Committee  on man-Power in their Final Report, (para-16). -
( 3). Compulsion not required.       It has been argued against a Ministry of Supply thatit  would be necessary to give it compulsory powers regardinglabour.   The foregoing analysis of the situation shows thatthere is a wide field of essential work which could be doneby  a Ministry of supply in peace time without recourse tocompulsion in any form.       The machine tools, the floor space and the labour ableto  cope with a large increase in the total volume.-Qfh.armmnent.production or a considerable acceleration of the rate ofproduction are in existence.   AS the Industrial panel says -notwithstanding the marked increase in the rate of productionof  aircraft, there still may be untapped resources in.industry which could and should be utilised on the same basis of voluntary co-operation as has hitherto obtained.   What iswanted is not the power to compel industryto organise itsproductive capacity but an organisation which would be in aposition to give a clear lead to industry as to what isrequired of it in the national interest.   This seems to berecognised by the panel as they state that they.are makinga comprehensive approach to organised industry for.itsassistance in discovering ways in which performance could be improved or progress expedited.   This points clearly to thedesirability of centralised direction and to the fact thatthere is nothing in the situation to-day which makes itnecessary to apply compulsion to industry.    The close collaboration between the Air&quot; Ministry and the aircraft industry which has resulted in a greatly increased productionof aircraft shows that the method of voluntary co-operation can
1I U 5&quot;deliver the goods&quot;, and until an effective attempt has beenmade to use the voluntary method to the utmost limit and thatattempt has  failed, there need be no question of compulsion.If when the method of voluntary co-operation has been fullytested, it is found to fail, the experience gained will indicate the reasons for the failure and where and how to apply compulsion.       Moreover, to embark upon compulsion even at the beginningof a war,  without seeing clearly in what directions and to what extent it should be applied would be in the highest degreedangerous.  - A Ministry of supply functioning in peace time wouldbe able to acquire a body of knowledge which would be of the--.greatest value in approaching- this difficult, problem.
