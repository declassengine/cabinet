THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3  GOVERNMENT.SECRET.     I attach a memorandum on the subject of our commercial relations with Russia in which an attempthas been made to set out briefly the essential points which must be borne in mind in considering the question of approaching the Russian Government with a view to theimprovement of the present position.   The memorandumhas been prepared in the Board of Trade in consultationwith the other Departments primarily&quot; concerned.     There is no doubt that the present position is unsatisfactory and I am being pressed by traders totake steps to improve it by negotiating a new trade agreement.   As shown in the memorandum, however,negotiations are beset with difficulties and it ispractically certain that very little progress could bemade unless the negotiators were empowered to threatensome kind of sanction to be applied if necessary to overcome Russian resistance to our proposals.   As thesanction would involve special legislation it isnecessary, before negotiations are commenced, to reach a decision on the question whether His Majestj&apos;-&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to introduce the necessary legislation if the progress of the negotiations showed that it was required.   It should be possible without undue difficulty to justify such legislation toParliament.   It is not goodwill, but intransigenceCP. 32(39)CABINET.COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.
A/which v*e shall meet in negotiations for a new Agreement,so that our negotiators to have any hope of success,  &apos;&quot;would have to he in a position to inform the soviet representatives, at some, probably very early, stage in the discussions that compulsion was the only course left to us.     The object of our negotiations should, I think,be the conclusion of a Payments Agreement (or possibly a Clearing Agreement) under which the proceeds ofimports into the United Kingdom of Russian goodswould be allocated in a prescribed manner.  Havingthis in mind the logical form of sanction would appearto be a unilateral Clearing.  The three forms ofsanction, namely, an embargo on Russian goods,discriminatory duties on Russian goods or a unilateralClearing, are discussed in the Memorandum.  The mainconsideration that should guide us in choosing theweapon is its efficacy in bringing about a speedytermination of the dispute and I think that bothpolitically and with a view to subsequent negotiationsa unilateral Clearing is the appropriate form ofsanction.     If a Clearing be established, there will be great pressure upon us to make some provision for thesettlement of pre-Revolution debts.  So long as the clearing remained unilateral and consequently did not obtain substantial receipts, clearly nothing muchcould be done.  On the other hand, in negotiationsfor an Agreement I think that the Russians wouldresist to the utmost any debt settlement which involved even a small part of the sum required being
tic)taken from the proceeds of imports  of Russian goods.The difficulties of securing a satisfactory agreement are in any case so great that I should he  extremelyreluctant to add to them &quot;by bringing in the questionof pre-Revolution debts.   The matter of the employmentof the &quot;Baring balances&quot; for this purpose  I leave to  theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary.     As indicated in paragraph 36 of the memorandum,  thereare strong objections from the point of view of theTreasury to the transfer of purchases of timber from russia to other  timber producing countries since  a further drain on sterling would be involved.     While due weight must be given to the difficultiesWhich are set out in the memorandum, I feol that in the face of the united front presented by the  United Kingdom-trading interests concerned, it would be difficult forHis Majesty1s Government to continue to do nothing butsympathise.   If this view is shared by my colleagues itwould follow that His Majesty&apos;s Government should enterinto negotiations with the Soviet Government for the revision of the 1934 Temporary Commercial  Agreement.But to open negotiations and to fail to obtain a more satisfactory agreement than the present one would only make matters worse, so that the conclusion appears to bethat it would be unwise to commence negotiations unlessthe Government are prepared to authorise the throat ofdrastic action against Russian trade and are preparedto introduce legislation to enable the threat to becarried out, in the event of the Soviet Government notbein;... prepared otherwise to agree upon a satisfactorj-&apos;settlement.
     If it is decided to take action, the procedure would&quot;be as follows:-     (l) to approach the Soviet Government for a revision         of the 1934 Temporary Commercial Agreement;     (2) if no progress is made in the negotiations to         give notice of denunciation of that Agreement;     (g) if denunciation should prove ineffective, to         bring forward a Eill providing a sanction to he         employed against Soviet trade - the sanction to         take the form of a unilateral Clearing.

MEMORANDUM.          Commercial Relations with the Soviet  Union.Provisions of the Temporary Commercial Agreement,  1954.   1. Commercial relations with the Soviet Union are at  presentgoverned by the Temporary Commercial Agreement  of February 1934,the main provisions of which were as  follows;-     (i) The Soviet Government undertook to give effect  to the          following arrangements in regard to  the balance of.          payments between the two countries -              The payments of the U.S.S.R. in respect of          British ^shipping and of goods p\irchased in the United          Kingdom shall bear to the proceeds of the U.S.S.R.in          the United Kingdom from s ales of Soviet goods  the          following proportions:In the year ending 31st December,	1934 ..	. 1 2	1.7it it it tt ti tt	1935 ..	. 1 :	1.5tt it tt tt tt tt	1936 ..	. 1 ;	1.4ti ti ii ti ti ti	1937 ..	. 1 :	1.2			1.1                    (Article  3  and  Schedule)    (ii)  The  Soviet Government  stated  their  intention  to utilise          in  an increasing  proportion  British  shipping services,          provided that  such  services  were available at market          rates (letter  of  the  same date  as  the Agreement).   (iii)  As  regards trading conditions,  the  United Kingdom          Government accorded to  the Soviet  Government the right          to  establish in London  a  Trade  Delegation to control,          regulate,  and  carry on  trade with  this  country          (article 5).    (iv)  Mutual most-favoured-nation treatment was accorded  in          respect of,  inter alia,  import  and export prohibitions,          Customs duties and  charges,  and shipping.     (v)  The  provision referred to  in  the inmediately  preceding          sub-paragraph  (iv),  however, was  subject to  the          reservation to either Contracting  Party of the right,          failing settlement  by negotiation, to  impose          discriminatory  import  restrictions  or  prohibitions          in  the event of the creation by the  other part of  such          prices as were likely to  frustrate preferences accorded          by  the first party.   2.  The Agreement is subject to six  months&apos;  notice of termination at any time.
Results of the 1934 Agreement.                           4 8   3. Parts of the agreement are now out of date and useless.For instance, the provision reserving the right to  imposediscriminatory import restrictions was necessitated by  theclause in the Ottawa -agreement with Canada of 1932  which required us to protect the preferences accorded under that agreement from frustration .by the creation of prices &quot;throughState action on the part of any foreign country&quot;,   ,&apos;i.s thisclause has not been repeated in the Trade Agreement concluded with Canada in 1937, the main reason for the continuance ofthe complementary provision in the 1934 Agreement with  theSoviet Union has disappeared.  Again the provision in respectof trading conditions was based on the assumption that  theresponsibility for contracts by Soviet economic organisationswould be taken by the Soviet Trade Representative in Londonacting on behalf of the Soviet Government;  thus the contractswould become subject to English law and the Soviet government undertook to waive their diplomatic immunity for this purpose.Since 1936, however, United Kingdom traders both import and export have been pressed to conclude contracts with the state trading Corporations in Moscow and in many cases to acceptonerous conditions including the stipulation of arbitration in Moscow.  The relevant clauses in the agreement give  themno protection in these circumstances.   4. The main criticism of the Agreement, however, is  thatin general its results have been unsatisfactory almost fromthe date of signature, especially as regards the most important matter from our point of view, namely, the purchase ofUnited Kingdom goods.   5. Throughout the negotiations in 1933 and 1934 theRussians resisted our proposal to allocate a specificpercentage of the proceeds of their sales in this countryfor the purchase of United Kingdom manufactures, and we onlygave way at the last meeting because the Russians repeatedlystated that &quot;it would be impossible for the Soviet Government                          -2-
to fulfil their obligations under  the &quot;balance  of payments scheme,except by increased expenditure on United Kingdom goods and shipping services&quot;.    It is clear  from  the following  statisticsthat the Russians have not increased their purchases  of UnitedKingdom goods apart from increased exports in  1938  due to  theExport Credits Guarantee Agreement of 1936 (see paragraph  7).                 Imports from  Exports  of   Re-exports                  the Soviet.   U. K.  goods,  -from the  U. K.                               -    millions -1934 .......         17.3          3.6          3.91935 .......&apos;        21.8          3.5          6.21936 .......         18.9          3.5          9.81937 .......         29.1          3.1          16.41938 (Jan.-Nov.)     18.5          5.8          10.2Technically they have more than fulfilled their obligations  underthe Agreement to balance payments  (see  Annex)  but  they have  done so by increasing their purchases of re-exported goods (mainlynon-ferrous metals, such as tin, copper and nickel, and  rubber).These increased purchases of re-exports were of valuable assistance to the United Kingdom re-export trade,  which  in recentyears, has suffered heavily from exchange restrictions  andbilateralism in international trade.   In 1937 the Russians tookmore than one fifth of the total re-exports from the UnitedKingdom.   Further most of these re-exported goods originate inEmpire countriea.   As regards shipping, whereas an  increase inthe use  of British ships was expected to  result from the  1934Agreement,  the Soviet Government have in  this respect alsoimplemented only  the letter of their undertaking inasmuch as,while the proportion of such charterings  to their  foreigncharterings as  a  whole has been not only  maintained  but  slightlyincreased,  absolutely  their charterings of United  Kingdom ships*have  declined with  their  decline  in their foreign  charterings  asa  whole,  due to  the  increase in the Russian Mercantile Marine.measured on a tonnage basis.
Export Credits Guarantee Agreement of 1956.   68 Soon after the conclusion of the 1934 Agreement theRussians began to hint that they would increase substantiallytheir purchases of United Kingdom goods if satisfactory creditterms could be arranged.  At that time Export Credits GuaranteeEepartment were limited to credits for 18 months for the soviet union and the Russians made it clear that that period was far too shorto  As there seemed no other way of increasing thesale of United Kingdom goods to the Soviet Union, the cabinet decided on the 12th February, 1936, to release Export credits guarantee Department from these limits and negotiations were accordingly entered into with the Soviet Trade representative in L03.1do.no  This &quot;resulted in the conclusion of an Agreement onthe 27th July, I9b6, the main provisions of which were asfollows:-   (i) The Department undertook to endorse and therebyguarantee Promissory Notes signed by the Soviet TradeRepresentative acting for and on behalf of the Government of theU0S.S0R. up  to a total  of  10 million, with interest thereonat     per annum.   (ii) The  orders  in respect of which whese Promissory Noteswere to be issued had to be placed with manufacturers  in theUnited Kingdom during the period 1st August 193 6 to50th September 1937.  The Soviet Trade Representative  had tofurnish the  Department  with full particulars  of  every  contractplaced under the Agreement.    (iii)  The  goods  purchased were  not  to be munitions  of warand  at  least 50  per cent  of  the  sah  price  of  the  goods  had  tobu derived from  expenditure  in  respect  of materials  grown orproduced  or  work done  in  the United  Kingdom.    (iv) a special  account was  to be  opened  in favour of theTrade Delegation of the U.S.S.R.,  at Lloyds Bank,  London, and into this account  the  face  value of  the  Promissory Notes was
to &quot;be paid by the Exports Credits  Guarantee Department out of funds obtained by them on. sale of  the Promissory Notes in theLondon Bill Market.    The money in this  account can only be  drawn upon by.the Soviet Trade Representative  to make  - -payments inrespect of shipments made under the orders placed under  theAgreement.   7.  The Russians succeeded in negotiating  contracts to thefull value of the  10 million by the end of October,  1937;   theywere granted a slight extension of time  to enable  them to use  upthe whole credit.   Most of the goods purchased by  the russians were capital goods of an armament or semi-armament  type,  and inview of the fact that the industries manufacturing  those goods were pre-occupied with defence orders the Russians  had -considerable difficulty when negotiating contracts  in agreeingthe  date of delivery, and they have repeatedly complained since then, with some  justification, that United Kingdom manufacturers are  seriously behind with their deliveries.    The  purchases  madeunder this Agreement did not affect to any extent  the tradestatistics for 1957, but they have had a substantial effect  onthe  trade statistics for 1938, and United Kingdom experts inthat year will exceed  6 million, of which probably about 4 million were  goods purchased under the Guarantee Agreement.Exports in 1939  seem likely to be maintained at about the samefigure as a  result  of  deliveries   under the  GuaranteeAgreement of about  4 million  in  that year.    It is  to be notedthat  the Guarantee Agreement  is formally and completelyseparate  from  the 1934  Temporary  Commercial Agreement,  exceptthat the  Soviet  Trade Representative, who plays an important part in the working  of  the Credit Agreement  (see paragraph  17below) derives his  status  from the provisions of Article 5of  the 1934 Agreement.
Views of United Kingdom Traders.        As might he expected, the unsatisfactory working of the1934 Commercial Agreement has given rise to a considerable and growing volume of complaint from United Kingdom exporting and shipping interests.   A deputation eventually submitted to thePresident of  the Board of Trade on the 26th May last proposalsfor the revision of the 1934 Agreement with the main objects of:     (i) increasing the purchases by the Soviet Government of           United Kingdom manufactured goods;    (ii) increasing charterings by the Soviet Government of           Br i t ish shi ps;   (iii) the  reversion by the Soviet Government to the conditions           of trading and terms of contract which obtained prior           to 1934.   9.  Much as the President of the Board of Trade sympathisedwith these proposals (and he so informed toe deputation) ho wasreluctantly forced to the conclusion at that time that in thecircumstances then existing it would be unwise to enter into negotiations with the Soviet Government for a. revision of the1934 Agreement.   Shorter stated, the considerations which  &apos;   &apos; V       :    . &apos; &apos;  :   - ;    . &apos; &apos; &apos; -   : . -  &apos;:.. : - &apos;    ;  -       .....: -  : ^ - . .  .... . :dictated this conclusion were that strenuous but abortive effortshad already been made in the negotiations for the 1934 agreement and the 1936 Guarantee Agreement to obtain more, favourable treatment for United Kingdom goods and. British shipping, and  thatstrong and re-peated representations to the Soviet Government had failed to secure better trading conditions;  that hitherto theUnited Kingdom demand for Soviet products had been so active asto constitute a sellers&apos; market for these products;  and  thatthe Soviet Government having something to lose and nothing to gain by a new Agreement would not he prepared to satisfy demands which they had already successfully resisted and would not boperturbed by any threat of denunciation of the existing Agreement.Finally, account had. to be taken of the possible serious effecton cur import and re-export trade of a probable breakdown in any                                -6-
negotiations followed &quot;by the denunciation of the Agreement, andit might -well &quot;be, by compulsory measures to place our trade wit&apos;the Soviet Union on a sa satisfactory footing.   10. It was considered essential, therefore, to consult the United Kingdom importing and re-exporting interests concerned, and on the 1st November, the President of theBoard of Trade was assured by a deputation on which these interests as well as the exporting and shippin,;. interests were fully represented, that they were generally in favourof a revision of the existing Agreement even if, to secureit, 11.1-1. Government found it necessary to take such special measures against imports from the Soviet Union as might involve a temporary rise in -prices and a severe dislocation,probably amounting to a virtual stoppage, of trade.   Inparticular, the importers made it clear that they would &quot;beprepared, if necessary, to find alternative sources of supply.A further and no less important development in the situationis that what was formerly a sellers&apos; market for Russian goodshas tended in the last six months or so to become a buyers1market.   Moreover, the purge which has taken place in the.Soviet Government has weakened the directing staff of the trading organisations ana perhaps their negotiating strength.Possible Form of hew Agreement.   11. At the same time, while it would appear that theSoviet Government is now in a somewhat weaker position thanat any time since 1934, there is groat difficulty in estimating the value which they attach to  the United kingdom market.   At present they use this market  in order to obtainfree exchange with which to purchase the non-ferrous metals(nickel,  tin, copper) which they  require,  presumably forarmament  purposes.   The object of  tie negotiations for  a new agreement  would be to force the Soviet Government  to increase their purchases of United Kingdom manufactures, which would
necessarily diminish the exchange available for the purchaseof raw materials and semi-manufactured articles.   It may hethat they would he prepared to increase their purchases of manufactures in order to retain even a diminishing amount of free sterling for the purchase of metals,  etc., hut itwould be difficult to justify to traders an Agreementcontaining a definite -percentage for United Kingdommanufactures and shipping unless that percentage was fairlyhigh, and it is impossible to foresee how far the SovietGovernment could be pushed in this direction,   12. It is difficult at this stage to state precisely what  shsuldbe included in a new Agreement, but broadly speaking our chiefaims in regard te trade questions should be to increase our exportsof United Kingdom goods and the employment nf British ships,  tosecure that the payments under the Credit Agreement are duly  made,and to persuade the Soviet Government to revert ti the methods eftrading which were in farce when the 1934 Trade Agreement was concluded (these are set out in detail in Article 5 of theAgrement).  The re-export trade would also have to be dealt with:this would be pressed by the Russians themselves.  Having regardto the existing provisions relating to the balance of paymentswe should of course press for practically the whole of the proceeds of Russian sales in this country to be spent here.  (Asto the question -if provision f^r financial creditors see para. 20below).  In translating these&apos;objectives into detailed provisionsbf an Agreement a number of difficult questions wwuld arise,  e.g.whether the sterling proceeds shculd be apportioned in great detail among the various interests which are to share in them or should be divided in such a way as to allow considerable elasticityin the distribution among those interests.  The proportions to be allocated to conflicting interests would involve much preliminary                           -S-
discussion before precise desiderata could be formulated and would constitute the chief matters in dispute in the negotiations.  Itis not proposed to include any detailed suggestions on these points in this memorandum.   13. As regards the form of the Agreement,  if it is to prescribe the allocation of the proceeds of the imports of. Russian goods(as seems essential) the choice seems to lie  between a payments agreement, such as that concluded with Germany and certain othercountries, or a Clearing Agreement.   Both kinds of agreementrequire the willing co-operation of the Soviet authorities.  In thecase of a Payments Agreement the administration would be carriedout entirely by them - subject to supervision in a prescribed formby the Embassy in Moscow and the Board of Trade.  In the case ofa clearing, the importers in this country would be compelled bylaw to pay the sterling to axi Anglo-Soviet Clearing Officeand the sterling would be paid out by the Clearing Office under instructions from the Soviet authorities in accordance with arrangements provided for in the Agreement.  A Payments agreement is preferable as it interferes less with normal methods of trade on conditioxi that the undertakings obtained from the russians are sufficiently precise to allow of no evasion.  It seems reasonable to assume that the Russians would keep the letter ofany undertakings; they have shewn themselves very hard bargainers,but whenever they have concluded an Agreement they have keptthe letter of it.   14. It must not be overlooked that United Kingdom industries -and above all the machine tool industry - have had greatdifficulty in carrying out the contracts placed under the  10million Credit Agreement. Repeated reference to this subject hasbeen made by the Opposition recently.  Under the Credit Agreementorders had to be placed within the 12 months ending September, 1937.The goods are being delivered roughly  4 million in 1933,  4 million in 1939, and  1 million in 1940.  The outstanding feature of these
orders has been the very lengthy period required by ourmanufacturers for delivery.   Since the Russians claim that they can get prompt delivery from the U.S.A. andother countries it may be expected that if they were askedto buy more manufactured goods in the United Kingdom theywould stipulate for some guarantee  of prompt delivery whichit would seem impossible either for His Majesty&apos;s government or the manufacturers to give*   It may be that thesedelays exist only in certain industries, but should webe prepared to sell and the Russians to buy the products of other industries in order to make the larger orderspossible?   The Russians might argue that we cannotsupply many of the goods they require which are goodssuitable for mass production factories and are more easilyobtained in the U.S.A. and the latest technical developments which only come in many cases from the U.S.A. or Germanyand the conclusion might be that a substantial increase ofRussian orders could only be found in goods of a smallUnited Kingdom content.   (Under the 1936 Credit Agreementall the goods supplied contained 50% or more of UnitedKingdom labour or materials).   15. It seems fairly certain that the Russians willresist an obligation to take regularly increased quantitiesof manufactured goods - which in their case means largelyindustrial equipment.   It would clearly be useless toextort such an obligation if it could not be implemented.In the past Russian orders have sometimes been of thegreatest assistance to the machine tool industry but those orders have been irregular and no reliance could beplaced on their repetition.   If an Agreement however isconcluded for a period of years, it is proposed to take theindustries concerned into consultation and make it clear
                                                        d ito them that they will have to adjust themselves to the changed conditions, and if they are assured of a regularflow of orders, they should be willing to co-operate and make any necessary adjustment in their programme ofproduction.   16. It is probable that the proposals about shipping would also encounter strong resistance from the Russians,and involve considerable difficulties in their executionby the British shipping industry.   A provision requiringRussia to use a specific amount of British tonnage, either generally or in a particular trade, would clearly involve an obligation on the British shipping industry to make suitable tonnage available at the time required and at reasonable rates of freight and conditions of service:  andthe shipping industry has already been told that, if itsrequests are to be pat forward, it must examine thevarious difficulties involved and produce a scheme whichwill give the Russian chartering authorities the securitythey can properly demand against what might otherwisedevelop into exploitation.   Having regard to the definite and large requests of the shipping industry for assistance,both financially and in Trade Agreements, and to the factthat in the long run our shipping can only be maintained and increased by increasing its share of the carrying ofthe world&apos;s trade, it is clear that every effort will haveto be made, both by the Government and the industry, to solvethese difficulties.Necessity of a S-nction in negotiations for the revisionof the 1934 Agreement.   17. As regards the opening of negotiations, it is we whowould have to take the initiative and it is certain that merelyasking the Soviet Government for a better Agreement than thepresent one would lead us nowhere.  There is little doubt,therefore, that it would be necessary for our negotiators to take a
firm line and be in a position to threaten some drastic action against Russian trade if,  as is probable,  a  more satisfactory Agreement could not  otherwise be  obtained.A restrictive measure of this kind, to be applied aftertermination of the existing Agreement, would require legislation which would have to be passed in time for effective action to be taken by the end of the sixmonths&apos; notice of denunciation.   18.  It may be noted that one effect of thetermination of the existing Agreement would be thatthe Soviet Trade Representative would cease to havediplomatic privileges and might be withdrawn.    his departure would not injure the Soviet Union but itv/ould create great technical difficulty in connectionwith the Guarantee Agreement and, as he alone  iscompetent to sign the documents which, are necessary before payment can be authorised,  the goods at present being manufactured under the contracts v/ould be lefton the manufacturers&apos; hands without any guarantee ofthe Export Credits Guarantee Department as to payment.The total of these goods in manufacture at the presentmoment is between  5 and  6 million, but this will gradually diminish as the goods are completed andshipped.   Shipments are at present proceeding at therate of about  400,000 per month.   While it is truethat this technical difficulty could be got over by an agreed modification of existing arrangements,   the soviet trade Representative might well decline to agree to anysuch modification, so that the termination of  theCommercial Agreement might result  in  goods to  the valueof some millions  of pounds being left on the manufacturers&apos;hands with possible demands by the latter on His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for compensation.
   19. In the event of drastic action &quot;being taken,  theU.S.S.R.  might refrain from taking steps to cancel  the contracts placed under the Guarantee Agreement but  would call for deliveries as and when made by the manufacturers and present to the Exports Credits Guarantee DepartmentPromissory Notes&apos;for guarantee by endorsement in thenormal way.   If such endorsement were carried out  (andit could not be refused without a breach of the GuaranteeAgreement) it would he possible for the Soviet TradeRepresentative to pay for the goods in the usual manner,but the Department would be open to serious criticism ifit continued to endorse fresh Promissory Notes at a timewhen the Soviet Government were defaulting in the paymentof the interest on the Notes already issued.   30. As regards the purely political aspect, the ForeignOffice, it is -understood, take the view that while, ofcourse, they desire to be on friendly terms with the soviet union as with other coiuitries, they would not be undulydistressed if action had to be taken against Russian tradein the event of negotiations not being successful.    Theyare inclined to think that the negotiations would  stand abetter chance if (in addition to making threats) we heldout some inducement such as a Permanent Trade Treaty, andin their view the Russians would probably object tonegotiating a mere revision of the temporary trade agreement and would insist on a general settlement or nothing;  in that case, the question of a debt settlement would at once come into the picture. &apos;  The  settlement ofthe old debts which the Russians would want would  be asettlement involving no expense to the Soviet Government;at the most they might be willing to agree  to the-utilisation of the Earing Balances and&apos; any  other balances                           -13-
due to pre-revolutionary banks or firms in Russia in returnfor all further claims being abandoned.   A settlement  onthese lines was discussed by the Cabinet at their meetings oh9th and 22nd July, 1936, and has since formed the subject of correspondence between the Chancellor and the foreign secretary.   As H.M. Government have repeatedly stated  thatthey would not conclude with the Soviet Union a PermanentTreaty of Commerce unless it were accompanied by a debtsettlement, it will be difficult to justify negotiating a definitive Agreement (even if it is not nominally a PermanentTreaty of Commerce) unless some reasonable satisfaction is obtained in regard to the pre-revolutionary debts and claims.But the Russians would probably resist strongly such asettlement if it involved them in any expense (since it couldbe quoted by many other countries) and, therefore, the  alreadygreat difficulties of securing a satisfactory trade agreement on the lines described above would inevitably be considerably increased by including in our demands a reasonable settlementof pre-revolutionary debts and claims.   21. If we enter into negotiations with the SovietGovernment for a revision of the 1934 Temporary commercial agreement, and no progress is made in the negotiations, thenext step, if the matter is to he pressed, is to give noticeof denunciation of that Agreement.   If the denunciationshould prove ineffective, it will he necessary in order topress the matter to threaten some sanction to be employedagainst Soviet trade and this will necessitate legislation as our existing powers are inappropriate.   22. The purpose of such a sanction would be to control thefacilities which the Soviet Government at present enjoy of spending the considerable sums of sterling received from thesale of their goods in the United Kingdom.  The SovietGovernment might immediately counter the sanction by                          -14-
diminishing or ceasing altogether their purchases  in  thiscountry, hut as their purchases of United Kingdom  goods  arecomparatively small (apart from those already purchased  underthe 1936 Credit Agreement), the damage to our export  trade inUnited Kingdom manufactures would not he considerable.    There-export trades might lose valuable Russian orders,  but if theRussians required their commodities for armaments  they would no doubt continue to buy&apos;&apos;, them, and would probably  have difficulty in buying them elsewhere than in the United Kingdom.The Soviet Government might refuse to allow the export to thiscountry of products which we should desire to obtain.   The.Soviet Government, as a further measure of retaliation,  might reduce or cease their chartering of British ships  and the trampsmight lose employment of considerable value ( Ig- million having.been paid to British shipowners by Russia in 1937) but  theshipping industry has taken a prominent part in pressing forthe revision of the present /agreement and it is fully aware of the dislocation that this may involve.   The brunt of theserious consequences of the sanction, therefore, would seem to fall mainly on importers of Russian commodities and on theshipping industry.Form of Sanction.   23. The sanction might take three forms, airy one of whichwill probably necessitate special legislation:-     (l) the imposition of prohibitions or restrictions on          imports from the Soviet Union;     (2) establishment of a unilateral Clearing;     (3) imposition of discriminatory duties.   24. As the Soviet Union would almost certainly attempt to evade the effects of any  sanction by exporting their goods to the United Kingdom through a third country, certificates of origin would be required in all  these  cases in respect ofthe goods affected.   In  the Embargo of 1933, in connection -
                                                         e 9  &quot;&apos;                                                         u t-with the trial of the Metropolitan-Vickers*  engineers,certificates of origin were found necessary for goodsconsigned from any foreign country in Etiropeor from China,Japan. Iran, Iraq or Turkey.   The Customs doubt whether muchreliance can be placed on certificates of origin;  theyconsider that only in exceptional cases could they exercise any effective control  and that, this being so, various interests concerned would soon become alive to the posslbilitieof evasion.    On the other hand the experience of the Embargo(which was admittedly brief) seemed to indicate that thecertificates were fairly effective.   It is impossible to envisage any form of sanction which does not involve as a consequence the requirement of a certificate of origin and itwill be necessary to assist the certificate of originarrangements by every possible means, such as co-operationwith the importing trades concerned.   In this connection itmust not be overlooked that arrangements designed to securethat goods purporting to be non-Russian are so in fact, arehound to act as an impediment in our import trade from thecountries, concerned and indirectly in the long run our exporttrade to those countries.   25. Another question that would have to be considered inall these forms of sanction xs whether all goods normallyimported from the Soviet Union should be included in their scope.   In the 1933 Embargo certain goods were exempted -the most important of which were furs and flax.   purs fromthe basis of a very valuable re-export trade, and Russian flaxowing to its quality is not easily replaced by flax ofother origin.   The Russian authorities have now imposedan embargo on the export of flax and if this be continued the question of exempting it from our embargo on importsneed not be considered.   The organisation representing the
fur trade, has agreed to action against imports of those commodities, if necessary, tout they assume that they will he able to obtain supplies of Russian furs toy some roundabout arrangement of importing them through third countries.    They have not apparently realised that if a sanction is applied against any Russian commodity,they might be debarred from buying it from any source.    If the imports of these furs are essential, it may be desirable to exempt them from the sanction at the outset rather- than include them and permit imports under licence.    On the other hand the Soviet Government might prohibit their export as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the United Kingdoms26. Of the three forms of sanction, prohibition by embargo seems the least attractive.    It would constitute a decisive rupture of commercial relations so unusual that   it might be regarded as being designed for some purpose other than commercial and thus lend colour to the accusation that His Majesty&apos;s Government were using trade grievances as a political weapon. Where the country, concerned occupies the exceptional political position of the Soviet Union, such an accusation must be anticipated.   Prohibition would involve a licensing system which would raise numerous administrative difficulties, as was discovered during the Embargo of 1933. There is no Parliamentary authority for such a prohibition. The Russian Goods (import Prohibition) Act, 1933, under which the Embargo was imposed in connection with the trial of the Metro-Vickers&apos;&apos; engineers has not been repealed and so far as the text ef the Act is concerned it would be possible to prohibit imports of Russian goods by Proclamation, which at the end of three months would require a Resolution for its   continuance in force.    A definite undertaking was however given to the House that the powers under the Act woiild only be exercised in connection with the engineers&apos; case.
   27. A unilateral Clearing would be an arrangement whereby-United Kingdom importers would be obliged by lav/ to pay into a clearing Office the sums due in respect of  Russian goods imported.   In the circumstances the Russians would almost certainly cease to export to the United Kingdom so that,  pendingthe conclusion of an Agreement acceptable to both parties as tothe utilisation of the sums in the Clearing, there would be acomplete cessation of United Kingdom-Soviet trade.   Thereceipts into the Clearing would consist only of the debts due inrespect of Russian goods already imported and those receiptswould be so small in relation to possible claims against themthat for the time being the best plan would seem to be to place them in a Reserve Account and to pay out nothing.   (Alternative!the Russians might adopt the device of General Franco andrefuse to permit the export of goods to  the United  Kingdomunless sterling payment were first made  in Russia.   If  theimporter badly required the goods, as was sometimes the  case in spain, he might have no alternative but  to pay  twice - once  tothe exporter and once  into  the Clearing.)   28. The  Treasury point out  that the  adoption of  a Clearingas the form of sanction involves  this  difficulty:-  His Majesty&apos;?Government  would be pressed to  state how any  sterling  collected by the Clearing would  eventually  be  distributed.    It  would bedifficult, a s  explained  in  paragraph  20 above,  to refuse to envisage any satisfaction  of the  sums   due  to claimants.   But,once  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  showed readiness to impose a clearing or&apos; collect Russian claims,  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be pressed  to  set  up similar Clearings with Chile,Mexico,  Brazil,  etc.,  which would have for one of their objects the  collection of the  claims of United Kingdom creditors.
29.    It is a legal question whether a Clearing could heestablished under the provisions of Section 1 of the DebtsClearing, etc. Act of 1934 which apply where payments ortransfers to the United Kingdom are restricted,  prohibitedor discontinued, but the Act was not intended to deal withsuch a case as the present and special legislation would,therefore, seem necessary.   30. The third form of sanction that might be employed isdiscriminatory duties.   The effect of this alternative isdifficult, to predict.   If the United Kingdom were a seller&apos;smarket for Russian goods the Russian exporter could pass onpart or all of the extra duties to the United Kingdom consumer.If, on the other hand, the United Kingdom were a buyer&apos;smarket and the Russians were selling in keen competition withexporters from other countries they would find it difficult topass on the burden.   The. United Kingdom, however, is at presenta buyer&apos;s market for most imports from the Soviet Union, sothat provided that there was no change in the terms of tradewith the Soviet Union in the near future, there is reason tothink that the burden of the extra duty would fall on theRussian exporter.   It is assumed that in the case of discriminatory duties certain goods which are urgently requiredin this country such as furs might not be included.   31. In this connection, however, there arises  a serioustechnical difficulty.   It is the usual procedure for  timberimporters to buy from the Soviet Organisations at a price which leaves  the  importer to bear  the  duty.   An  increase  inthe duties, therefore, simply means  that  the  importer wouldhave  to find  the  additional charge and would  pass it  on  to theconsumer  in increased prices.   It would  be necessary,therefore,  to give  the timber trade  ample warning against  thedanger  of concluding  contracts, as the normal practice  of
the trs.de is for many of the contracts for summer shipment tohe concluded ahout January.   It might be possible to provide in the Act which imposed a sanction some protection for theimporter against the liability of taking the goods if theRussians insisted on his paying the extra duty.   52, As against these serious difficulties, discriminatoryduties present certain advantages.   A case could be made outthat, if the Russians fail to provide reasonable facilitiesfor United Kingdom goods, H.M. Government cannot continue-to give their goods the most-favoured-nation treatment whichat present they receive.   Discriminatory duties have alsothe merit of keeping the dispute confined to trade matters.They can be adjusted to such degree of severity as might benecessary for the different types of goods, and could be varied from time to time.   Apart from the question of certificates of origin which affect all forms of sanction,their administration should not be difficult and they would bring in some revenue to the 7ilx.cheq.uer.   33. If the Soviet Union ceased to have most-favoured-nation rights, the rates of duty which have been reduced underTrade Agreements with other countries could be restored by treasury Order to their previous levels  in their applicationto Russian goods.   The only practical effect of this,however, would be that  the duty on the larger and more expensive sawn softwood would revert from  5% (or some higher figure) to 10^ ad valorem, and the duty  on certain workedsoftwood (floorings, matchings&apos;i skirtings, etc.)  from 10fj  to15$.   It is unlikely that these increases  in duty would havethe effect of bringing  any considerable  pressure to hear   onthe Soviet Government.   For  any higher  rates  of discriminators-duty, fresh legislative  powers would be  required;  and here a
difficulty arises,  j-it present the only cases in which importduties can he imposed by Order, at rates higher than thoserecommended by the Import Duties advisory Committee, are thosein which a foreign country discriminates against British goods(Secto 12 of the Import duties Act 1932).  This considerationdoes not apply in the case of the Soviet Union and thereforespecial legislation would be necessary to impose . discriminatoryduties on Russian goods imported into the United Kingdom.  Thecircumstances in which more extended powers could be exercisedwould be difficult to define.  To take general powers toimpose such duties on the goods of a particular foreign country on the ground that that country had failed to make a trade agreement with us, or had failed to take a sufficient quantityof British exports, would have Inconvenient results;  asindustries which had applied unsuccessfully to the AdvisoryCommittee for an increase in duty, or which wished to obtain an increase without the trouble of making out a case beforethe Committee, would, bring pressure on the Government to use their new powers for the purpose of giving increased protection against imports from particular countries.  If, therefore,fresh powers are to be obtained, it would seen advisable to limit them specifically to the case of the Soviet Unionio   34.  The choice of sanction is a matter of some difficulty.For the reasons given in paragraph 25 above, a prohibition ofimports is objectionable as it might be held to be  imposedfor political reasons,  AS between a unilateral Clearing anddiscriminatory duties, the former will have a sharper andmore decisive effect than the latter, and may, therefore,bring about a speedier settlement of the dispute.   It will.of course, be appreciated that this superior efficacy will produce more serious effects on United Kingdom trade, but incases of this kind traders will probably prefer measures which
                                                            u 3are swift and deeisive to those which are perhaps less painful,hut which tend to prolong the dispute.   35. It cannot he assumed, however, that any form, of sanctionwill necessarily bring the Soviet Government to terms.   it isimpossible to say to what extent the Soviet Union,  by findingother markets for her produce,  would be able to put up withrestrictions on her trade with the United Kingdom.    For  thelargest item - timber,  accounting for  10 million out of  a  totalimportation of  39 million in 1937 - there is some reason to suppose that, owing to the operation of the international cartel(over which the Soviet Union has considerable influence)  underwhich the total exports each year from each of the principalEuropean timber-producing countries are limited to an agreedfigure, the effect of a restriction of imports of Russian timberinto the United Kingdom might be simply to t ransfer Russianexports to other markets.   The Russians had some difficulty  infilling the quota alloted to them under the cartel arrangementslast year and although it is believed that they will be able  to fill this year&apos;s reduced quota, there are persistent reportsthat they will have little timber to spare, and if things donot go according to plan the Soviet Government might not besorry to have a reason for non-fulfilment of their cartel quotawhich need not entail reduction of that quota in future years.As the United Kingdom takes about half the Russian exports of timber and a considerable proportion of the Russian  exports ofother commodities, it is clear  that a restriction on  the trade would involve  the  Soviet Government  in difficulties, but the extentof these  difficulties and the  effectiveness of the sanction cannotbe predicted with  any certainty.   Our  own difficulties must notbe overlooked..   The highest class  of Russian wood is irreplaceable
but this and other specialities may not be a third of thetotal timber imports from Russia.  Inferior substitutes couldbe found to some extent: the gap could be filled from canada and U.S.A.  The Scandinavian countries also could make up some of the deficiency in the ordinary qualities.  prices would rise.  There is the further, consideration that, for reasons of defence, ample  supplies of timber at the lowestpossible prices are desirable.  Defence considerations apply with even greater force to flax, and far from the Sovietobjecting to an obstacle to her flax exports the SovietGovernment has in fact itself recently placed an embargo on exports to flax.  36. Prom the point of sterling exchange it would be highly undesirable if purchases of timber, furs, etc. wereswitched from Russia to North America, either U.S.A. orCanada.  At least the Russians are buying raw materials herewhich are in large part from the Empire and support sterling.Even if the orders are switched mainly to scandinavian countries, that is decidedly less advantageous to us thanthe present Soviet system as at present Sweden, Finland, etc.are taking gold from us.  37. As to the possible consequences of the introduction ofa clearing on the Promissory notes guaranteed by the export credits Guarantee Department, it is conceivable that theRussians for the sake of their financial credit would continue to honour these obligations punctually.  On the otherhand the Russians might well argue that the introduction of a clearing had destroyed the hypothesis on which these notes were issued and that H.M&apos;. Government had assumed a responsibilityfor utilising any money in the Clearing towards paying theseNotes.  If in view of this we attempt during thenegotiations to provide for the payment of these Notes difficulties would arise.  If we allocate a certain
percentage of the receipts of the Clearing it might not prove enough whilst if we allocate a fixed, sum there would he left for current trade a fluctuating and uncertain amount.In any case, if the Russians wore to cease exporting to the  United Kingdom there would he no sterling available for payment of the Notes and it is improbable that the russians would use- their other free currency for this puruose in thecircumstances,,  In effect, unless the Clearing negotiationsignore the Rotes altogether whey would transform them from a trade debt  into an inter-governmental debt, a much less satisfactory form of obligation,,  It may be thought thatthese difficulties would disappear with the conclusion of anew Agreement but if, in the meantime, default on any cf the                               ..v.Notes (or the interest thereon) had taken place thesettlement of that problem would bo one of the first problems for the negotiators and an additional handicap.                            SUMMARY.   58o(i) The existing Trade Agreement has proved  disappointing,particularly from the point of view of developing the exporttrade in United Kingdom goods and the Board of Trade have been subject to continuous and growing pressure from exporters  tcnegotiate a more favourable agreement.  It must he &quot;borne inmind, however, that in 1938 and 1939 United Kingdom exports willbe about double whs t they previously were owing to the operationof the Guarantee agreement of 195 6.     Similarly the existing Agreement has proved disappointingto our shipowners.     r -     (ii) On the other hand;-      (a) The Russians have more than fulfilled their   obligation to purchase goods  in  the United Kingdom, resulting   in a large increase  in our  ro-export trade (largely British   Empire produce).                         -84-
        (b) It would be detrimental to the position of sterling     if  we purchased from other countries (eag* N. America)     the timber etc.which we now buy from Russia.        (c) There is little prospect of obtaining a more     favourable agreement except by the exercise of some sanction     which would cause a serious disturbance of our important     trade with Russia (amounting  in the aggregate to about     40  million a year) , much of which is in raw materials     which industry urgently requires.        (d) It is difficult to controvert the Russian argument     that the main reason for the  smaliness of our export  trade     is  that our terms (delivery and/or prices) for the things     Russia wants are not competitive.        (e) AS regards the Guarantee Agreement, the Russians might     refuse to take up goods not yet delivered and fail to meet     their repayment obligations.        (f) The negotiation of a new agreement would be rendered     much more difficult by the claims of the pre-iievolution     financial creditors, unless these were kept firmly in the     ba ckgrouiid.     (iii) If negotiations  are opened, it will be necessary to  be ready to legislate for and impose some  sanction with the  object of forcing  the Russians  to  terms.   It is suggested that  the most appropriate  sanction would be  a unilateral  clearing  which impounded money due  to  the Russians by importers  in  the United Kingdom:   certain goods  (e.g.,  furs) might be  excluded  in our  own  interest.   It  is, however, by no means  certain that any  form  of  economic  sanction that we  could  impose would have  the  desired  result. *Board of Trade,    January,  1939*
                                                      i iJ                       A IT IT B X.     As the provisions in the 1934- Temporary commercial agreement for balancing payments with Russia are somewhatcomplicated it has seemed necessary to set them out brieflyin a separate Annex.     To begin with, the Agreement provides only for thebalancing of payments in certain ratios and not the balancingof trade,   The United Kingdom trade statistics of anyparticular year do not, therefore, give any indication as to how payments&apos; &quot;between the two countries were balanced.     Briefly, the Agreement provides that&apos; the Russians should undertake in each year to spend in the U.K. a certain propor-tion of their receipts from the sale of their goods in theUnited Kingdom.   In 1934, the first year of the Agreement,this proportion was ton-seventeenths, which was in 1958 toreach,ten-elevenths or approximate parity.   The Russians atpresent, therefore, are under an obligation to spend in thiscountry about 91/o of their receipts from the sale of theirgoods.     Each, year the Russians submit figures to the StatisticsDepartment of the Board of Trade of their receipts and their expenditure, which are discussed and checked before beingfinally agreed.   As the Russians soil for cash their receiptsare approximately equal to the value of the imports shown inthe United Kingdom trade returns.   Their expenditure, howevercan be very different from, the United. Kingdom statistics of exports and re-exports.   In the early years of the Agreementthey made substantial payments in respect of goods which hadbeen bought on credit, and exported in the years before theAgreement;  b?/ this moans they were able to exceed their obligations, though their purchases of United Kingdom exports were comparatively small.
     There are also other items of expenditure which they areentitled to include and which are hot represented in theUnited Kingdom trade accounts.   For instance, they are allowedto include their payments on chartering of British ships andalso a sum equivalent to 6-^5 of the total turnover of trade(imports, exports and re-exports) representing the sterlingrequired for the expenses of the Russian trading organisationsoperating in this country.     As mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Memorandum they have,technically speaking, more than fulfilled their obligations to balance payments in the manner prescribed in the Agreement.They have consequently accumulated an excess of payments (theAgreement allows such an excess to be carried forward from yearto year) which at the end of 1937 amounted to 514,051,000..  Thefigures for 1950 are not yet available.     The statistics in paragraph 5 indicate that this excess ofpayments is largely due to the increased purchases by theRussians of re-exported goods, which in the year 1937 reachedthe very high figure of  10.4 million.
