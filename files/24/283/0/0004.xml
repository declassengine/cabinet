(THIS.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY5S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.CP. gj.(39).COPY NOC AA 3 I IT E T.ANTI-AIRCRAFT DEFENCESCSS - GIBRALTAR, MALTA ANDADEN memorandum by the Seoretai&quot;-.y of State for. Air.1.At their 34bth Meeting held on the 26th January,1939, the Committee of Imperial Defence invited theSecretary of State for Air &quot;to submit to the Cabinet astatement of the present position regarding the supplyof R.D.F. to Malta and squadrons of aircraft to malta and Aden and to make proposals for acceleration&quot;,These questions have now been examined and the positionis as follows,2.     R.D.F. for Malta-       Had nob the September crisis interfered with arrangements, an experimental R.D.F. set would have been supplied to Malta before the end of 1938.   But thisapparatus was diverted in September to the A.D.G.B.chain and has been retained there as a necessary partof the home R,D.F. defences,3.     Provision has been made for the large scale production of this equipment and under the present pro-gramme there would be two sets available from the contractors in June of this year, of which one would be allotted to Malta*   The remaining sets for defended portsabroad will be provided between September, 1939, and march, 1940 .4.     If, however, a measure of relaxation in the rulegiving absolute priority to A.D.G.B, is to be permitted,one R.D.F. set with improvised equipment can be released
at once from the home R.D.F. chain, for use overseas.It can he ready for despatch between the raiudle ofFebruary and the 1st March next.5.     The terms of reference refer specifically onlyto Malta in connection with R.D.F.   It is recommendedthat in view of the relative defencelessness of Malta andthe need for some means of warning to enable the population to take cover, the first R.D.F. set to be made availablefor overseas should be despatched to Malta.   The nextset to become available in June should be despatched to Aden.6&apos;     Air Units for Malta.       The Air Ministry are submitting for the approval ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence a proposal to form a fighter squadron at Malta as soon as possible.   It will,however, not be possible to form this unit in the nearfuture without making an inroad into our available resources in fighter aircraft and pilots  in the Metropolitan Force.In view of the incomplete state of our fighter defences athome, and of the limited value  of one fighter squadron todeal with the very heavy potential scale of air attack on Malta the provision of such a unit cannot in presentcircumstances.be regarded as justifiable.7.     Air Units for Aden.       Another recommendation that the Air Ministry aresubmitting to the Committee of  Imperial Defence in their general proposals for the necessary increase of our air strength overseas is that the air forces in Aden should beincreased by one fighter squadron.   An examination of thepossibilities of forming a fighter squadron at Aden revealsthat as far as aircraft are concerned it would be practicable to form a nucleus of this squadron at an early date withGladiator aircraft now in store for the Fleet Air Arm, ifthe Admiralty could agree to their release,   At presentthese are the only existing fighter aircraft suitable foruse under the climatic conditions prevalent at Aden.
8.    There can he no doubt that the early provisionof even one flight of fighter aircraft at Aden would havea most valuable moral effect and would provide at least some means of dealing with enemy bombers actually attacking the Colony.      In the first instance therefore the Air ministry would propose to station one Flight of eight fighter aircraft at Aden as early as possible, provided theAdmiralty agree to the release of the aircraft in question.The main difficulty is that of finding the necessary&apos;personnel without reducing the number of fighter pilotsavailable for Home Defence.  It may be necessary in thefirst instance to provide the fighter Flight by re-equipping part of the G-.P. bomber unit now in Aden.  Butthis problem will be examined in detail and it may bepossible to provide the Flight by other means.9.    In this connection, while there can of course be noquestion of relaxing in any material degree our control in the Protectorate, in which the squadron at Aden is theprincipal agent, it is important that our commitments inthe way of minor operations in the hinterland should inpresent circumstances be restricted to the absoluteirreducible minimum.  The Air Ministry feel sure they can count on the co-operation of the Colonial Office in thisrespect.10. .  No acceleration of the provision of additionalBomber or General Reconnaissance Squadrons at Malta orAden is at present practicable owing to personnellimitations.  The existing Bomber Squadron at Aden is,however,, due for re-equipment with Blenheim medium bombers in March.
11.   A.A. Guns.      It is understood that the War Office recommend thedespatch of A,A. guns to the three ports in question onthe following scale :-                        311     3.7&quot;Malta                  .4       8Gibraltar                       8Aden                            4The Air Ministry would not wish to oppose the release ofthis number of guns from A..D .C-.B. t though they considerthat the question must be related to the proposal nowunder consideration to retain the British A.A. regimentin Egypt and to supply additional 3&quot; guns to the egyptian army.  They are in some doubt as to the order of priority recommendeds but note that the Committee ofImperial Defence agreed at their 345th meeting that thisquestion is to be examined by the Chiefs of Staff.12.   There is an anti-aircraft battery on the IndianEstablishment stationed at Peshawar.  India cannot inpresent circumstances be regarded as likely to be subjectto any form of air attack,  and it is considered that theGovernment of India should be approached for the temporaryloan of this unit., in order to reduce the call upon our a.A. resources at home.13.   Summary.      (a)  A temporary R.-D .F, set can be made available           for overseas between mid-February and 1st           March.   Priority in the provision of this           equipment should be afforded to Malta,
A 9(&quot;b)  In view of trie incomplete state of our Fighter     &quot;defences at home, the allocation of any-      additional trained fighter pilots to overseas      Commands is not considered justifiableo(c)  The acceleration of the formation of the      proposed fighter squadron at Malta is not      justifiable in present circumstances.(d)  The early provision of a fighter unit at Aden      is practicable provided the Admiralty can agree      to surrender a proportion (16) of the      Gladiators now in store for the Fleet Air      Arm.(e)  No acceleration of the provision of additional      Bomber or G.R. Squadrons overseas is at      present practicable.(f)  The immediate despatch of additional A.A. guns      to the three ports should be related to      possible additional requirements in Egypt,      and the allocation as between the ports should      be decided by the Chiefs of Staff,(g)  The Government of India should be approached      for the temporary loan of the A.A. battery      now stationed in Peshawar.(Intld.)  K.W.Air Ministry, W.C. 2.     1st February, 1939.
