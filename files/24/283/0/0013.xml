STAFF CONVERSATIONS WITH FRANCE                               &quot;AND BELGIUM.                     (Previous Paper Ho. CCS.  795).                                 Report.           1,    We have  considered  the question of extending  Staff           Conversations  with France and Belgium and of  initiating                                   ...  &apos;.           Staff contacts with the Dutch in accordance with the                           -           following terms of reference which have been  remitted to           us by the Cabinet&quot;:-                      &quot;(h) Agreed  that  Staff  Conversations with the                             French  and Belgian Governments should                             proceed on the basis of war against                             Germany and Italy  in combination  and                             that  these Staff Conversations should                             be extended in  scope to  include                             all likely fields  of operation especially                             the Mediterranean  and the Middle  East.                        (i) Agreed  that  while  the probability of                             Japanese intervention against us  should                             not be  ignored it  should be assumed                             that  Japan would be likely  to he                             influenced by her  existing  commitments                             in China and  by  fear of  Soviet Russia                             and the United States of  America and                             would therefore  be likely to adopt                             a somewhat cautious attitude at any                             rate  at the outset of any emergency                             in the  near future.(j) Agreed that it would be necessary that      the question of Staff contacts with      the Dutch should be taken into account.(k) Agreed that it is contemplated that the      further Staff Conversations with France      and Belgium which would follow from the      diplomatic approach referred to in (e)      and (f) would result in the formulation^Cabinet 3(59).
                of specific joint plans both as regards                military operations and in the sphere                of supplies;  it being recognised that                such joint plans would constitute a far                more binding commitment than has                hitherto been contemplated.          (l)  Agreed that periodic liaison of a                regular nature with the French and Belgian                Staffs would be necessary to keep up to                date the plans referred to in (k) above&quot;.2.     We have considered this question under the following headings:-     ; (a)  The level at which the Conversations with the            French should be conducted.      (b)  The venue of the Conversations,?      (c)  The theatres of operations which the Conversations            should eoyer0      (d)  The scope of the Conversations with particular            regard to the extent to which we should disclose            our war plans to the French and information            which, in turn, we wish to obtain from them,      (e)  The Conversations with Belgium                    and      (f)  The Conversations with the Dutch0The Level at which the Conversations with the French should  be conducted.5.     We consider that this aspect of the Conversations withthe French will have an important bearing on their success,,On the one hand, there would be advantages in conducting the conversations on a high level;  for example, between the Chiefsof Staff of the Defence Services of the two countries.   Thehigher the level, the more authoratitive will be the viewsexchanged, and the more rapid the progress towards reachingfinality.    It is probable that the French would welcomeConversations on a high level.   On the other hand such Con-versations could not escape considerable publicity throughout europe and a visit to this country by General Game 1 in,might be interpreted by the publie as a repetition of the events of last September,   Moreover, wo cannotignore the probability that the French might seize the  opportunity to  make political  capital out  of
important Staff meetings.  It is possible that close  contacts between the professional heads of the Defence Servicesof the two countries might provoke precipitate action on thepart of Herr Hitler on the grounds that we and the french were actively engaged in planning for war with Germany.Apart from the undesirabilitjr of giving car.se for this,there is probable general agreement that, in existingcircumstances, it is to our advantage to play for timeuntil our rearmament is further forward, provided that this does not have the effect of delaying the planning which isnow wanted.       In our view, therefore, the Conversations should heconducted on a level which could reasonably be regarded asmerely a continuation of the cont3.cts which were establishedafter the London Agreement of 1936 and which have beenopenly continued ever since.4.     Our proposals are, therefore, that the conversations on our side should be carried out on the level of themembers-of the Joint Planning Sub-Committee, and that theFrench should be invited to send representatives ofapproximately a similar&apos; standing.  We do not think that,by adopting this plan, serious delay need he caused.The Venue of the Conversation.?.5.     We consider that the Conversations should be carriedon in London.  We think that; this is an important pointsince we should be in a better position to avoid any unduepublicity or comment and, in addition, to exercise a greater measure of control over the Press, should this be                          necessary.
       We feel that&apos;as we are the instigators of thesecloser contacts, the -French should, fall in with ourwishes on this point.Theatres of Operations.6.     We are of the opinion that the Conversations should cover all possible theatres of war in which joint action oroperations by ourselves and the French are possible.Procedure.7.     We suggest that the conversations should he conducted in stages.  The first stage would be to discuss with theFrench our general strategical conception of a war in whichwe are engaged as allies against&quot;Gernany and Italy.  Weshould authorise the Joint Planning Sub-Committee to use as a basis of discussion the European Appreciation whichhas just been completed under our direction and will shortly be submitted, for Ministerial approval.  Having given theFrench our conception of the general strategical picture,we should then invite them to inform us of their Appreciation.If it were found that their views were in general accord withour own, we would report accordingly and proceed to thenext stage.  If the views held by ourselves and the Frenchdiffered widely and proved irreconcilable, we shouldash: for further instructions before proceeding.8.     When the first stage has been satisfactorily completed,we recommend that the Joint Planning Sub-Committee should beauthorised to discuss broad outline plans in the severaltheatres of operations.  These might conveniently he divided                        -4-  j
 into  the Western  theatre,  the Mediterranean  and middle last  theatre,  and the  Far  East  theatre. 9.    The  third and  last stage  would &quot;be the  preparation &quot;by  each of the Services of detailed joint plans with  the French.  In this  stage, it might be necessary for -Staff discussions to tales  place  between  the British and French Naval Commanders  in  Chief  concerned. Scone of the Conversations. 10.   We suggest  that  we should have authority to impart to  the  French such information  as  to  our  plans  as  is necessary  to ensure  co-ordination  in peace and efficient co-operation in war  and full information as  to our military resources  except  with  regard to certain technical details.We  should  expect  to  receive similar information from  them. If  necessairy, any difficult questions about  these would bebrought up  for discussion,,Conversations with Belgium.11.   In our view, the discussions would be  undulycomplicated if they  were of a tripartite charactere  Wetherefore consider that we should  reach general agreementwith  the French before bringing in the Belgians.  Werealise that some  conmiunication to the Belgians may benecessary to avoid giving  them  the impression that their co-operation would be unwelcome and we invite the attentionof the Cabinet to  this point,
Coiivevsationsi.with  the Dutch. -12-,   We  consider&quot; that at  a  later  stage it will  he desirable, if possible to  engage in conversations  withthe  Dutch particularly with  regard to the defence  ofthe  Netherlands  East  Indies,   As to this it will be recalled  that in a  report  to  the Committee of  ImperialDefence dated January, 1958  (G.I.D0 Paper Ho,;  1585-3),the  Chiefs of Staff viewed the prospect of closercollaboration with  the Dutch  on defence matters  with somemisgivings, owing to  the danger that,  to the Dutch wayof  thinking, such collaboration would be the prelude tosome undertaking on our part  to go  to their assistance,      In  those circumstances  the Chiefs of Staffsuggested that-      &quot;If an international situation should, in  the         near future, cause us  to  enter into          conversations with other  and more important         Powers  than  Holland, we suggest that          conversations with the Da.tch should follow          rather  than  precede the major discussions1&apos; c      We  consider that the above advise holds  good and that Conversations with the Dutch should take  place at a later stage0                           (Signed)  CoL.IT, lilAAALLo                               &quot;     ROGER  BACKHOUSE.
