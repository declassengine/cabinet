10 J(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT) SECRET.                                         COPY NO. CP. 49 (59).                         GAB I N E T.THE STATS OF PREPAREDNESS OF THE ARMY IN        RELATION TO ITS ROLE.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.     1.   At the Meeting of the Cabinet held on the2nd February (Cabinet 5 (39) Conclusion 3), it was agreed to postpone consideration of items (l) to (5)(a) in theSecretary of State for War&apos; s&apos;vMernor ^ndur^)(c^]?^ 27 C39)) inorder to allow time for the whole proolem to be examined further by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaryof State for War and the new Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence as soon as the latter had taken up his duties.     2.   The proposals in the Secretary of State for War&apos;sMemorandum and in the Report by the Chiefs of Staff(CP. 28 (39)) have been discussed at two meetings attended by myself, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the Secretary of State for War.   The conclusions reached at these meetings, which my colleagues and I recommend the Cabinet to accept are as follows:-.          FIRST (REGULAR) CONTINGENT - Items (l)-(S)..    - 3.   Item (1) - The mobile Division to be organised iii-to tw-gsmaller Divisions at an estimated cost of- 5 millions..   Thisproposal is strongly pressed on the ground that the present.mobile Division is unwieldy and out of balance.   We recommendacceptance of this proposal.
                                                         lb J     4C   Item  (2) - First two regular Divisions to beprovided with full equipment and reserves at an estimatedcost of  15 millions.          Item  (5) -- Second two regular Divisions to be.equipped as in  (2) at an estimated cost of  11 millions.          In regard to both these items, we are satisfiedthat it is essential in present circumstances that all fourregular Divisions should be provided with equipment and reserves on the scale estimated to be required forco nt.men.tal warfare.     5.   There remains, however, the question of the period between mobilisation and the date when the first and secondechelons of the First (Regular) Contingent are ready to embark./The first echelon comprises&quot;two Regular Divisions and one(split) Mobile Division (l,e., items (l) and (2) above);the second echelon comprises two Regular Divisions and thesecond Mobile Division (he., items (l) and (5) above .J7  Thelength of this period materially affects the amount of reserves which must be accumulated in peace-time and the expenditure involved.   The present arrangements for the despatch of theField Force are based on the first echelon being ready to embark in 21 days, and the second echelon in 40 days aftermobilisation.   The Chiefs of Staff are examining whether thedespatch of the first echelon could be expedited.     6o   There is the  further consideration that, untilStaff Conversations  with the French have taken place, itwould, in our view, be unwise to reach a final decision asto  the dates on which the first and second echelons should be despatched, overseas.     7e   Our recommendation is that for the present theSecretary of State for War should be authorised to proceed on  the basis  that the first echelon would be ready to embark                     &apos; .      -2 -
in 21 days, and the second echelon in 60 days aftermobilisation.   This means the acceptance of item (2)as it stands (estimated cost. 13 millions) and ofitem (3) at a reduced cost of  9,600,000.     8o   Item (4) - Formation of two &quot;Colonial&quot;Divisions out of existing non-field force units and provision for these two Divisions of equipment and reserves on a Colonial scale.    Estimated cost  11millions.    The Report of the Expert Committee on theDefence of India, dated 30th January, 1939, contains a recommendation that India should maintain a forceconsisting of one British cavalry regiment, three british and seven Indian infantry battalions for external defence.   If this recommendation is adopted;, the use ofthese troops would be decided between the two governments in their consideration of the  war plans.   There-would thus be a further Division available to reinforce incertain areas the two proposed &quot;Colonial&apos;Divisions.     9.   We recommend that the proposed formation oftwo &quot;Colonial&quot; Divisions and the provision of equipment and reserves on a Colonial scale should be deferred until a dec.:.;-.ion has been reached on the Report of the expert Committee on the Defence of lndia0    10*   Item .5(a) - Provision of War Equipment and reserves for four Territorial  Infantry Divisions at an estimated cost of  30 millions.    In regard totbio item also an important factor is the date atwhich these Divisions should proceed overseas.
We recommend that in the forthcoming Staff Conversationsour representatives should proceed on the assumption thatthese four Territorial Divisions should be fully equipped and ready to embark six months, instead of four months,after the outbreak of war.  This would reduce the costby some  3 to  4 millions.  Subject to this modification,we recommend acceptance of this proposal.   We attachparticular importance to early steps being takento create the war potential required to maintain -these four Divisions in the field.-  We understand that thecapital expenditure required for this purpose amounts.:to some  6 millions and is included in the estimated total cost of  30 millions &quot;given above.    11.    The figures given in this Memorandum,which are taken from the Secretary of State for War&apos;sMemorandum, are approximations only, and are subject to financial review.   Our recommendations in this paper are,of course, subject to detailed examination between the WarOffice and the Treasury of the expenditure necessary tocarry out the Secretary of State for War&apos;s proposals.
