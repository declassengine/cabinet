        Camps for War and Peace Purposes.Joint Memorandum by the Chancellor of the  Exchequer             and the Lord Privy Seal.      1.   We  were  asked by  the Cabinet at its meeting on the 1st February  to  discuss further the proposals in CP. 22(39) with  a  view to submitting to  the.Cabinet a revised scheme designed  to test the possibilities of camps and taking into account the points raised in  our previous discussion.   We have considered this  matter further and it seems to us that a scheme on the  following lines would  be appropriate.      2.   The scheme should be directed to the provisicn of accommodation within a distance of sorne^ 20 or 30 miles of the big industrial centres.   The object in war would be to enable these camps to receive some of the adult refugees who might pour  out  of the  large cities, and provide them with very rough and ready accommodation until more permanent arrangements could be made for housing them.   The camps should be built on a dormitory system so that in peace time they would be most suitable  for  children;  in  war much large numbers of adults could be  given heat, shelter, food and drink but the conditions wculd be  rough.      33   We  contemplate that the camps should be built so as in peace  time to accommodate  about 350 children each.   On this basis the capital cost of each camp would be from  17,500 to  20,000.   We doubt whether it is practicable to secure the erection  of any  considerable  number of these camps by nextAugust, but we should aim at  getting the camps ready for occupation by March 1940.    We suggest that it would be reasonable to start with a programme of 50 such camps.
     The proportion of this total to be provided in scotland will require consideration in the light of the housingsituation in that country.   4.   On the question of organisation we agree with theprevious proposal that the scheme should be entrusted to anon-profit-making association which in peace time should beexpected to use the camps for any purpose that might beconsidered suitable.   We think the aim should be to pay as good a return on the money advanoed as possible up to, say4% on half the capital, and repayment of half the capitalover 20 years.   The company should be on a strictly businessfooting and we should attempt to secure a Chairman of well-known business ability with a first rate managing director.   The company should he set up as soon aspossible, but in the meanwhile Government Departments should start immediately looking for sites and getting advice asto the best standard type of camp.   The company should berequired to place contracts by means of competitivetenders, though it would be given power in suitable cases to acquire country mansions round which hutted camps couldbe erected. -  In Scotland we agree that the work might appropriately be entrusted to the Scottish Special housing association.   The constitution of the Company should beso drawn as not to exclude the provision of camps forpurposes other than those referred to above e.g. holidaycamps if the Government should at any time decide thatsuch provision is desirable.   5.   Legislation will be necessary on the lines of appendix 11 of the Report attached to CP. 22(39).This legislation should he passed by the 1st April atthe latest, and it is for consideration whether itshould be  in  the form of  a separate Bill or includedin the A.R.P. Bill.7th February, 1939.       I
