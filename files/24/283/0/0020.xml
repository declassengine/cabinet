(HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT), EGRET..P.  47(59).COPY NO.1         CABINET.FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO CHINA.Memorandum by. the, ghanc.elTo.rl      of the Exchequer. 1.      The  gabinet  asked that  the  Treasury  should  prepare for consideration a scheme for supporting the Chinesecurrency by means of an Exchange Stabilisation Fund, towhich British Banks would contribute  3 million (with aguarantee from the Treasury) and ghinese Banks a further 3 million.   A scheme has been prepared in outline by theTreasury in consultation  with the Bank of England, and,subject to certain detailed points, the British Banksconcerned (the Hong Kong  Bank and the Chartered Bank) areprepared to join in the scheme0   The Treasury have also had the advantage of consulting Mr. C. Rogers, the adviser to the Chinese Government whose services were lent by theBank of Englando   Mr. Rogers has been very successful inwinning the confidence of the Chinese and, largely owing tohis advice, they have been remarkably successful in preventing the collapse of Chinese currency during the hostilities.2.     I am bound to point out that we must incurconsiderable financial risk in entering into any scheme for supporting Chinese Currency,,   It is no - ordinary financialrisk to try to control the external value of a country&apos;scurrency while lacking the power to control the currency
and credit policy of that country --particularly when thecountry concerned is at war.   No. one can safely predictthat the exchange value of the Chinese dollar will notsuffer further depreciation during the life of thearrangements and despite all safeguards that can he devisedand given the utmost skill in management there is risk ofconsiderable loss on winding up the Fund.       As regards the amount of the Fund, it isdifficult to judge what sum would be adequate to achieve the purpose of the Fund for the next twelve months and itmay well be argued that it would be better to start theFund at a figure of, say,  10 millions.   It is -understoodthat the Chinese Banks would be prepared to increase their contribution to  5 millions if we did the same.   But weshould be increasing our stake substantially withoutnecessarily assuring final success.   This matter needsfurther consideration but I should like authority to settlewithin a total of  5 millions.3.     The Exchange Stabilisation Fund would have as its purpose to maintain so far as possible stability in the sterling value of the Chinese dollar.   The Chinese Governmentwould undertake that during the life of the Fund their financial, economic and monetary policy would be designedto maintain the stability of the Chinese dollar.   This infact has been the policy of the Chinese Government hithertoand it has, in the circumstances, been exceedingly successful.4.     The Fund would be managed by a Committee consisting oftwo representatives of the Chinese Government Banks, one representative of the Hong Kong Bank, and one of the Chartered  -Bank, and Mr. Rogers, who would look after the interests ofthe Treasury as guarantor, and who would be given wide powersof supervision of all operations.       The Stabilisation Fund would be managed on the same general principles as our own and other Exchange Equalisation
Funds,  that is to say, the Fund would support the Chinesedollar by using its sterling assets to buy dollars,  when the dollar is weak, and would buy sterling back again when the dollar is strong.   If things go well i.e. if the present warends within a reasonable period, leaving an independentChinese Government, there may be no loss and the sterling couldbe made good when the Fund is wound up.   On the other hand, ifthe Chinese dollar weakens progressively from 8d. to, say, 4d.and eventually China, and the Chinese currency collapse, thewhole of the Fund might be lost.   The Hong Kong Bank and the chartered Bank are not in a position to risk losing a consid-erable part of the  3 millions (or  5 millions) which theywould put up and they therefore require a Treasury guarantee.The Treasury would propose to the Banks that a part (say 10%)of the risk should not be covered by the Treasury guarantee6o as to avoid the Banks being placed in a position in whichthey would have no motive for avoiding loss.   They may,hnw-ever, not feel it possible to contribute any amount withouta guarantee.   The point could then be met by obtaining an assurance from the British Banks that, in operating the Fund,no opportunity would be taken of using the Fund to improve their own position.   If the Fund shows a profit when woundup the profit would come to the Treasury for the portion ofthe Fund in respect of which the Treasury had given aguarantee against loss.5.     The arrangement would stand for 12 months and thereafterhe renewable by agreement for periods of six months at a time,subject to the possibility of the Fund being wound up earlier,either at the desire of the Chinese Banks, with the consent ofthe Chinese Government, or at the desire of the British Banks,with the consent of His Majesty!s Government.    The intenticwould be that the Fund should be wound up after the close oihostilities.              .  .    &apos; &apos;  &apos; -3-  ill                 f
 6.       The operation would, therefore take the form of a banking operation and not of a direct loan to the Chinese Government,,   A direct loan to the Chinese Government would &quot;be more provocative to Japan and would not really afford much greater security to the Treasury since there should be no considerable loss in either case if things go well, and the Chinese Government would not be in possession of the sterling required to repay a credit if things go badly. 7.       The question has been raised whether, even though the scheme provides for supporting the Chinese currency through the British Banks, we should not ask the Chinese Government to accept liability for making good to His Majesty&apos;s Government any eventual loss. Such a request would be reasonable enough in normal circumstances, and it is possible that the Chinese Government would agree to it;  but they might well stipulate that, if they are to accept ultimate responsibility for losses, first the assistance should take the form of a direct credit to the Chinese Government - which raises political difficulties; and secondly, that the complete control of the operations should be left to the Chinese Government, which would raise difficulties with the British banks. Moreover, for the reasons given above, the value of- any such undertaking  by the Chinese Government would appear problematic. 8.       Legislation would be required and it is suggested that it should take the form of the Treasury being authorised to give guarantees to British Banks in respect of operations to maintain the stability of Chinese currency provided that the amount of the loss to bo made good shall not exceed
  3 (or  5) million.  There will of course have to be a detailed  . agreement &quot;but it would hardly he possible to schedule the  agreement  to the Bill because the detailed arrangements  would, necessarily be confidential in character. One  cannot publish from the house-tops the arrangements about an Exchange Equalisation Fund. 9.    The chief criticism which seems  likely to be offered as regards the proposal is that it is wrong in principle to give  financial assistance to a Government which has  just declared its  inability  to continue the service of its foreign loans.   The most important foreign loans of China are secured on the Customs,  and although the  Japanese have occupied ports which produce some 70^ of the total Customs revenue, China has up  to the present continued to meet the full service of her foreign debt, which amounts to some  5 million a year. This  of  course imposed  a very heavy burden on the Chinese exchange,  and on 15th January the Chinese Government announced that it could no longer find foreign exchange for this  purpose  a*id that the service of  the foreign loans would have  to  he suspended.  Up to the present there has been no actual  default, and there will be no  default on the Customs loans until the 1st July.  It would not be fair to compare China&apos;s  default with the default  of countries like Brazil and Mexico, since the Japanese now collect 70f- of the revenue                           :&apos;;v&apos;,: &apos;:m\&apos;l&apos;&quot;m;&apos;d&apos;&apos;d:!;i&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; d-&apos;--C&quot;-&apos;i / !,d&apos;.. &apos; v&apos;&apos;.&apos;.^;. ; &apos;-&apos; .. dd-:&quot;;&apos;&apos;-.: d&apos;-&quot;-! &apos;1&apos;  .&apos;; &apos;.  k-  &apos;  &apos; which forms the security for the Customs loans.   I; do not recommend the offer of  financial assistance to the amount of  3 or even  5 millions should be conditional on the Chinese  government  reeunang  obligations  to  the extent  of 6 millions a  year.   But  it would  certainly  be desirableto obtain  from the  Chinese  Government  some  reasonable offer and,   if possible,  to  get  the  representatives  of the-bondholders to recommend  this  offer as  acceptable.  Forexample, the Chinese  Government might  offer  to transfer a
4 r?^     the proportion of the full service of the loans  corresponding     to the proportion of the total Customs  revenues  which they     still  control;   i. e.  about 30 per cento   We  should have     to ascertain from the Chinese Government  whether they are     prepared to make such an offer,  and if so, the best  course     would  be to arrange that it should be submitted  to the     Alness Committee - which represents the British   holders     of Chinese  bonds - for their acceptance as an interim     arrangement.   If this could be  done,  the  Chinese Government     could  not be regarded as in default.     10.   I do not propose that we  should make the offer to     support for the Chinese currency conditional on the imple-     mentation of the Customs arrangement negotiated with the     Japanese Government by Sir E.  Graigie last May.   The     Chinese Government have rooted objections to this arrangement     on the ground that it involves an infringement of Chinese     sovereignty.  At the same time,  every effort  should be made     to find a formula which would enable the  agreement to be     carried out  so  far as to  secure  that appropriate  quotas     towards the service of the foreign loans  should be allocated     from  the Customs revenues collected  in the  areas  under     Japanese control.  It would have to be made  clear that  the     Chinese Government would  not be  held responsible  for the     transfer of  these  quotas  into foreign  currency,  and the     question of  securing their  transfer  without  charge on     Chinese  Government  resources would have  to  be pursued as     a separate question.
