This document ia the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.SECRET.                                                      Copy No.CP. 5i(&amp;j)                               CABINET.                CLUBS BILL (H.L.) and CLUBS REGISTRATION BILL.                       Memorandum by the Home Secretary.        1.   These Bills, which are down for Second Reading respectively in        the House of Lords on the 2nd March and the House of Commons (Second        Order) on the 17th March, raise difficulties out of all proportion        to the intrinsic importance of their provisions and it is necessary        for the Cabinet to consider carefully what attitude should be taken        by the Government.        2.   A summary of the main provisions of the existing law relating        to the sale of intoxicating liquor in clubs and of the recommendations        of the Royal Commission of 1929-31 is given in the Appendix.        3.   The present position is briefly as follows:-               (a)  The respectable clubs would probably be prepared to          agree to some form of control provided that (i) the position of          existing clubs was safeguarded;  and (ii) the control did not go          further than was absolutely necessary for the prevention of abuses          by those clubs which are formed not as social institutions but          solely for the purpose of facilitating the supply of drink to their          members.   They would particularly object to being subjected in any         &apos; way to the control of the Licensing Justices, to the assimilation          of their hours to those of public houses, and to any general right          of entry being given to the police.               (b)  The temperance organisations and the licensed victuallers,          for different motives, desire to see the position of clubs          assimilated generally to that of public houses.
        (c)  The attitude of the &quot;brewers is uncertain as they have   financial  interests in many of the clubs.        (d)  The Government is committed to the principle of   regulation for the purposes of dealing with the abuses of bogus   clubs, but is not committed to the form which such regulation   should take.            There is  EL strong demand for legislation  fj^cam   the  licensed victuallers and the temperance organisations.   This demand has recently been presented forcibly by a deputation   from the Council of the Christian Churches.4.   The House of Lords Bill carries out, with minor modifications,the recommendations of the Royal Commission.   It contains all theproposals which are particularly objectionable to the clubs and goesmuch further  than is necessary for the limited purpose of preventingabuses  connected with bogus clubs.   Even if it passes the House ofLords,  it is  certain that it has no prospect of being passed by theHouse of Commons.5.   The House of Commons Bill contains the minimum provision whichwould make any Clubs Bill worth proceeding with;  it is confined to registration  and it does not deal with hours or with police entry.The attitude  of the clubs to the Bill is not yet known.   With one important exception, the Bill contains no provision, except on points of detail, to which the Government need object.   The exception is theproposal in Clause 5 that, in the event of objection to the registration  of a club, the question must be referred for decision tothe County Court Judge.   The Home Office view is that the county court Judge is not an appropriate authority to deal with this question and that it would be preferable that it should be decided by theStipendiary Magistrate in places which have a Stipendiary Magistrate
                                                             &amp; jL X2*.  X. 3^,and elsewhere by  the Justices for the Petty Sessional Divisionconcerned, i.e. that any objection to registration or continuedregistration  should be dealt with by the authority which has power to strike a club off the register.60   I suggest that the Government Spokesman in the House ofLords should do his best to prevent the Bill from receiving aSecond Reading.  He should explain that the Bill goes a greatdeal further than is necessary  for the purpose of dealing withbogus clubs and raises questions dealt with in the Report of theRoyal Commission which ought to be reserved for any comprehensivemeasure dealing with the licensing problem as a whole.  He mightexplain that so complicatedNand controversial a Bill introduced at this stage in the Session is unlikely to have any  chance of reaching the Statute Book in the absence of facilities from theGovernment which cannot be provided, and he might add that a more limited Bill has been introduced in  the House of Commons which,so  far as can be judged, has a reasonable prospect of passing into law.7.   As regards the House of Commons Bill? my present view is strongly that the Bill should be supported on Second Reading andthat any necessary  facilities should be given to  ensure that itpasses into law with such amendments as may be necessary in committee.  I would propose, however,  that the precise line to be taken should be further considered by the Cabinet nearer the date for Second Reading., when  there has been more opportunityfor ascertaining the probable attitude&quot; to the Bill of the various&apos;interests concerned,                                 -S.

                      APPENDIX.Summary of Main Provisions of Existing Law and Recommendations               of Royal Commission on Licensing.Registration.     Licensing law is not concerned with the formation of a club assuch but with the supply of intoxicants to the members of clubs or their guests.   In order to obtain facilities for this purpose a clubmust be registered by the Clerk to the Justices.   On payment of a feeof 5/- and on the furnishing of the required particulars (which includethe name, objects, number of members and rules relating to hours andcertain other matters) the Clerk must register the club.   Registrationis renewable annually.     The Royal Commission recommended a system of discretionaryregistration, renewable annually.   The Registration Authority, underthe Commission&apos;s scheme, was to be a Committee of the Justices in eachPetty Sessional Division.   Before registration, the authority was tobe satisfied that prescribed conditions, including suitability of premises, good character of management and absence of &quot;tie&quot;, werecomplied with.   The Police, the Local Authority and owners or occupiers of neighbouring houses, were to be entitled to object to registrationon the ground of non-compliance with the prescribed conditions, or torenewal of registration either on those grounds or on the grounds offrequent drunkenness, disorderly conduct, etc. (paras. 519-26 of Report).Removal from Register.     A club can be removed from the register only as a result of courtproceedings, taken e.g. on the grounds of breaches of the law orfrequent drunkenness.   There is nothing to prevent another club whichmay be virtually the same club occupying the same premises and consistingof the same members being immediately registered.   The court candisqualify the premises but the law is easy to evade.
9 -? 9 1^     The Commission recommended that the grounds for prosecutionshould be extended and that in any case of conviction of those responsible for the conduct of the club, the court should have powerto remove the club from the register (paras. 527-8).Police Entry into Clubs.     Clubs are not subject, like licensed premises, to police entryexcept under the authority of a search warrant.   It is difficult toobtain evidence to justify application for a warrant.     The Commission recommended that power of entry should be conferred on the Police on the express authorisation of a Chief Constable or his deputy (para 529).Hours.     Clubs are subject to the general limits as to earliest hour of opening, latest hour of closing and maximum hours of opening, buteach club, instead of having to conform to the hours laid down by the licensing Justices, is at liberty, within the statutory limits, to fix its own hours.   Thus, if the Justices fix a latest hour of closingearlier than the latest hour permissible under the law, :e.g. if theyfix 10 p.m. in London instead of 11 p.m. or 9 p.m. in a provincialdistrict instead of 10 p.m., the club may fix its latest hour at 11 p.m.or 10 p.m. as the case may be.     The Commission recommended that, subject to certain exceptions,clubs should normally be required to comply with the permitted hoursobtaining locally (paras. 482-7).
