Offices of the Cabinet,                                  Richmond Terrace,                                      S . &apos; /. 1 .                              3lst Jamiary, 1939.Dear Prime Minister,       ;.7e were constituted by you last December as yourAdvisory Panel of Industrialists to receive representationsas to any delays, defects or difficulties in supply orproduction under the rearmament programme and to suggestremedial action in such cases, and also any generalimprovements in regard to the execution of the programmeor any measures in regard to the position of industry intime of emergency which our knowledge of industry mightdictate to be&quot; desirable.    Labour questions were excludedfrom our purview.       We have now made a preliminary survey of the rearmament and allied problems and of the progress so farachieved, and we have endeavoured in -this letter to provideyou with some account of the work that the Panel has so farcarried out and to acquaint you with the general impressionwhich it has formed as to the position in the various partsof the field c overed.Work JiOfarcarriedout.you met the Panel on theit the objects which you had       particularly that you       method of approach       to fetter it in any       You will recollect that20th December and explained toin mind in setting it up, emphasisingdesired that it should settle its ownto its task and that you did not wishway by laying down any method of procedure.   We subsequentlyturned our attention to the scope of our problem and to thecourse of action we should follow in tackling it.   Our firstconclusion was that we must make, as a preliminary step, ageneral examination of the whole field of rearmament andof such other defence measures as fell within our terms ofreference and that we might, with advantage, firstly considerthe items which in our opinion seemed of more immediateimportance.   In this category we included such matters as thesupply of anti-aircraft equipment and air raid precautionsin relation to industry.       We were impressed at the outset by the need for urgencyin starting our investigation and therefore held our firstmeeting on the 30th December,   Up to date the Panel has heldsome fifteen meetings and has covered the following subjects,in connection with which it has &apos;had discussions with, and received memoranda from, the officers and others whose namesare also indicated.Supply of Anti-aircraft  equipment.Air Raid Precautions in  relation to industry.Vice-Admiral Sir Harold Brown Director-General of Munitions Production at the War Office,Sir John Anderson, the Lord Privy Seal, and Mr. Eady, Deputy Under Secretary, Air Raid Precautions Department, Home Office,

In certain instances we have been ableto offer advice which we think may have a beneficial effect.We are satisfied that no information or evidence of materialimportance has been withheld-from us.       We have also been approached by a number of firms and individuals putting forward suggestions or complaintsregarding matters connected with rearmament or defensive measures generally.   We have given,individual consideration..riviu/these the, pqsiiapnas we,find it.       We are not in a position at this sr...you in detail, but the Panel anticipatesit to record the general imnressions that &apos;Pfi  tothat it has   report zoyou would wishformedup to the present time.Bearing in mind all the circum-stances surrounding the problem of rearmament and the urgent need for rendering the country safe&apos; against aggression inthe shortest possible time., the Panel is of the opinion that
so the  Service Departments, supported by the Treasury, are, as far  as  circumstances permit, rapidly accomplishing a most difficult  task  of great complexity, with efficiency and  foresight,  even  to the  extent, in some cases, of establishing practically new industries in the country. We feel that.the magnitude  of the effort which has been and  is  being made, is altogether insufficiently realised by the  country  as  a  whole,  nor is it possible to convey this to them without divulging figures, which would.be detrimental to  the national interest.        The results obtained up to the present time could not  have been achieved without the whole-hearted co-operation of industry, operating, it  must be remembered, on a peace-time basis.   The Panel is satisfied that this co-operation has been generally  forthcoming  and would like to quote as an example the close  collaboration between the Air Ministry and the  aircraft industry, as a result of which there has been so marked  an increase in the rate of production of aircraft. notwithstanding this statement the Panel holds the view that there still may be untappied resources in industry which could and  should be  utilised on the same basis of voluntary co-operation as has  hitherto obtained.   The Panel is at present&quot; directing  its attention to this question, and, in this connection, is  making  a. comprehensive approach to organised  industry for its  assistance in discovering ways in which performance could  be improved or progress expedited.        In  view  of  the comparatively short period that elapsedbetween setting in motion the rearmament programme and the crisis,  the Panel  considers that it was inevitable that certain gaps in the  defence equipment of the nation should have been  found to exist at that time but it feels, on the evidence submitted to it, that most of these gaps eitherhave been, or are being, filled as rapidly as possible. The  Panel  is glad  to note that the principle of sub-contracting and  of  taking work to labour, rather than the reverse pi*ocess,is being widely adopted and it considers that the use of this principle  should be  extended wherever practicable.   Itdesires  to emphasise that,  despite the very marked improve-ment  in  production during the last three months of lastyear, and  the snowball effect of having diverted large sections of industry to the task of rearmament, no relax-ation of effort should be allowed to take place.        The Panel has reviewed at length the question of air raid  Precautions in relation to industry, and is of theopinion  that no useful purpose would be served by commenting on the  situation at  this stage, as it has had the advantage of a &quot;-discussion with the Lord Privy Seal and, as a result,feels assured that he has the whole problem in hand and is fully conscious of the desirability of expediting hisprogramme.    We would like  to stress most strongly that inour  opinion the fullest co-operation and goodwill on thepart  of  all concerned will be required if Air RaidPrecautions schemes are to &quot;be made really effective in theimmediate future.    We- do not in any way minimise the magnitude and complexity of the Air Raid Precautions problem
            and in consequence we urge that the Bill which we understand            is shortly to he laid before the House of Commons, should            be placed on the Statute Book as early as possible in order            to clarify the position.   we feel that every assistance            should be given to the Lord Privy Seal in his most difficult            task and that Industry and Local Authorities and the nation            as a whole should treat the question as an immediate and            vital one.                   The Panel has also made certain recommendations to            the Lord Privy Seal which it hopes may lead to the stimulation            of the carrying out of Air Raid Precautions by industrial            undertakings.   lie/ on his part, has expressed the wish to            keep in the closest touch with the Panel and avail himself            of their advice wherever possible.Future             ./e have laid down a comprehensive programme ofwork,       future work to which we propose to address ourselves.   We            intend to survey other parts of the field and to carry            out investigations into particular items that may be brought            to our notice by Government Departments, organised industry            or individual firms.                   In conclusion, we venture to hope that the foregoing            information may be of value to Von.                                  We are,                                       dear Prime minister,                                           Your obedient Servants                                  (Signed) J.H. m.
