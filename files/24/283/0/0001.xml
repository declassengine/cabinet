REPORT.  10     At their  341st Meeting held on 15th December, 1938,  the Committee  of Imperial Defence had under consideration  a Memorandum by  the Secretary of  State for !7ar on the State  of Preparedness  of  the Array in Relation to its Role (C.I.D.  Paper No, 1498-B).         The  Conclusion recorded by the Committee of Imperial  Defence was:-         To refer  the Memorandum submitted to the Secretary           of State for War on the  State of Preparedness of           the Army in Relation to  its Role (C.LD. Paper Ho.          . 1498-B)  to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee for           examination and report with a view to ;&apos;.trj           reconsideration by the Committee of Imperial           Defence at as early a date as possible.                       INTRODUCTION.  2.     The  composition,  role and  equipment of the Army has been  the subject of consideration by Ministers on a number of-&apos;  occasions since  the original  D.RoC. Report was submitted to  the Cabinet in 1934.   We do not  propose to review the whole  history of  this  matter,  but we wish to set out clearly  the present authority under which the War Office are now  working.    This  authority results from a decision arrived at by                 s   CI.D. 314st Meeting, Conclusion 2.
the Cabinet on tho 23rd,Harch,  1958,   which.authorised thefollowing scale of preparation for war:-       (a)  Two Regular Divisions and one Mobile Division              with equipment and war reserves of              munitions sufficient for defensive warfare,              ready to embark in twenty-one days.       (b) . Two Regular Divisions with war reserves              of munitions at half the scale of              (a), ready to embark in for try days,       (c)  Provision of a pool of equipment and              munitions sufficient to permit despatch              overseas four months after the outbreak              of war of a further two Divisions              (Regular or Territorial) with war              reserves as in (b)o3.     The reference in  this decision to equipment and reserves&quot;sufficient for defensive warfare&quot; arr.se  from the  view expressed during the discussion on the  role and  equipment of  the  Army,that the scale and ecaii.p-r.ent of reserves should not.be related to Continental warfare,.but to warfare in some othertheatre^       &apos;J.:1 s authority of  the Cabinet was,  however,subject to the expenditure involved being within the priorities laid down by the Minister for Co-ordination.of Defence,  and within the finance which could beprovided for  the army   Further, this authority was subject  to certain ,restrictions in regard tothe extent of the industrial capacity which mightbe created.Cabinet 16 (38) Conclusion 6.
4.     In April, 1958, a settlement was readied inregard to the total allotment of money for there-armament of the Army which involved a cut of 70 millions on the estimates submitted by theArmy CoLmcil.   The cut imposed was spread overa number of Army  services.    So far as the field force was concerned., its effect was to make itimpossible to provide the equipment requiredfor the pool referred to para,y2 (o)above.       Summarised briefly, therefore, theauthority under which the Army Council are at presentproceeding is as follows:-    REGUIiAJ^jyaJY:  (a)  2 Divisions and 1 Mobile                      Division should be ready                      for despatch at 21 days,                      with equipment and war                      reserves of munitions                      sufficient for defensive                      warfare only,,                  (b)  2 Regular Divisions should                      be ready to embark at 4-0                      days, but with war reserves                      of munitions at half the                      scale considered necessary                      for defensive warfareaTERRITORIAL APa-IY:  (c)  Ho equipment is available                      beyond the strictly limited                      scale deemed sufficient                      for training at Drill Kails                      in peace-time.   This scale                      would be quite inadequate                      for training once the                      Territorial Army had been                       embodied -
o0        EFFECT 0? THE PRESENT LIE I TUP ARi-T        MAHDATE OH OUR P07/ER TO MAKE THE&apos;        BEST USE OF OUR RESOURCES AMD            OPPORTUNITIES IN WAR.  &apos;5.      Before dealing in detail with the Array proposals in relation to calls likely to he made upon our land forces, we wish to deal in general terms with the effectof the decisions which  will  govern the rearmamentand equipment of the field army, upon our power to makethe best use of our available resources, and the strategical opportunities open to us in  war.So      The effective industrial capacity for armamentswhich can be built up is conditioned by  the volume oforders which can be placed in peace tirhet  In consequenceof the limitations of the mandate governing the fieldaraiyia programme,- the War Office have, we understand, beenable to build up &quot;a war potential&quot; which would suffice tomaintain in the fields under the conditions which it isestimated will prevail, the 4 regular divisions plus 1mobile division covered by (a) and (b) of the cabinet decision of 23rd March, 1958,,  In&apos;certain respects s weunderstand that  the  war  potential created provides  for rather more than this force, but it would fall  very far short of the war potential required to provide initialequipment and reserves  and to maintain in the field,a second contingent of four divisions.7.      It follows, therefore, that if   on,or shortly after,the outbreak of war, the Regular contingent  proceedsoverseas, and is enc;aQ-er&quot;i in Oi*e&quot;J.M OTB,  it will be
necessary to set. about the task of cre-atjLng-..addi.ti aaaT.industrial capacity before we should be in a position to equip and to maintain in the field any additional divisions-,The task of creating this additional capacity would  tosome extent be assisted by the decision reached by theCabinet in July 1937 that, so far as concerned theallocation of firms for production of munitions in time ofwar, the preparations of the Supply Beard should proceed on the assumption that the field force in time of war would consist of 2 contingents of four divisions each plus onemobile division.   But this decision was limited to paperplanning, and conferred no authority to spend money  onacquiring the requisite machine-tools, etc.- or on placing the educational orders which are necessary to get effectivewar potential,   Nor is provision, being made for the war&apos;requirements of India, the Dominions., and those alliesbound by treaty to us and whose forces are equipped  withour materials   We are informed that, speaking in general terms it might take at least a year before the additional capacity required could prccc.ee the equipment and reserves to enable us to pur. into the field, and to maintain  in thefield, any addition to the field force of four divisionsplus one mobile division, now authorised,8.    The point which we wish to emphasise is that,  solong as this&quot;, decision stands it is impossible for us to ensureputting into the field in the first year of war any  land force,properly equipped, substantially larger than the small forcenow authorised, however the situation may develop,,   Noamount of exertion after the outbreak of war could remedythis state of affairs.   Consequently, our hands would be tiedon land to such operations as can be carried, our. with such.
a Force equipped, it will be observed, on a scale suitablefor a Second Glass theatre of operations0       We regard it as part of our functions to considerwhether such a position is consistent with a right use ofthe  sum total of our available resources (industrial capacity, man power and personnel) for defence purposes.Our present policy (as laid down by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence in his report of 15th December,1937,s subsequently confirmed by the Cabinet) givespriority to the demands of the Navy, the Royal Air Forceand the units in A.D,GCB, over the Field Force.   Weare in full agreement with fhis policy and recognise that considerable calls on our man power will be made by the.Navy, the       , the Merchant Navy, A,D,G.B, andother Army formations which may be required for homedefence and the provision of troops to maintain essential services, as well as by the A,R,P, servicesand  by industry.   Nevertheless, the information supplied by the Man Power Committee leads us to believethat even after meeting these demands there will bea surplus of man power far beyond the requirements ofa Field Force of five Divisions,   So far as industrialis concerned, it would be outside our functions toexamine the position in detail but, although themechanisation of war may result in demands upon war industry&apos; even greater than in 1918, yet according toour information, even with the rearmament  programme infull swing, only about 30 per cent, of the Britishengineering industry is employed on armament work.   after allowing for the increased call on that industry whicthwill be requisite to meet the full needs of the wars Paper No. CP. 316(37).
potentials  of  the  other Services we are advised thatthere  should be ample  capacity for the increased Armydemand which we envisage.9.     We v/ish  to make  it clear that we are not raising the  question whether in another war we should be obliged to j  or should  have the resources which wouldenable us to equip and raise a large army comparable tothe  army which we  raised in the last war.   Nor are we.concerned here with the question of what commitmentssif any, we  should  enter into with our- allies in regardto   land forces.   The special point we are concerned to make is  that we should not allow ourselves to remainin the  position wherebys whatever the situation onthe  outbreak of war, we should be limited, in consequenceof the  policy  governing our preparations in peace.to having available in the first year of war a forceof only 4 regular divisions plus I mobile division..   Ifwe were so  limited, this might well mean that thiscountry would  not be in a position to make the best useof its  available resources,, or to put its whole strengthinto, the war during what might prove to be the critical period.10.    Looked  at from this point of vie-/ the first essentialis to  increase the war potential to such an extent thatit would be  capable of producing the equipment, required tomaintain in  the field the force dealt with in theMemorandum by  the Secretary of State for War0    But, as wehave already explained, the task of building up theincreased potential can only be achieved by placing advanceorders with  the firms concerned,  and such orders would (webelieve) go  far to provide the equipment and reservesasked for by the Secretary of State for War in hisMemorandumn
 11.     Vie  would  conclude tills part of our report by one general observation.  It lias been our constant experience  in recent years to nave a portion of  the Array  engaged in operations in various parts of the world,  Examples are Shanghai, Egypt and Palestine.  We have been unable to find the troops for  these  enterprises without drawing on the formations allotted to our regular field Army. Thus although in  theory we should be able on the outbreak of war  to make available as a field force the four regular  divisions and one mobile division authorised, in fact both units and equipment from these  formations may well be already engaged in duties abroad.   We consider it essential that in future we should possess the power to find and equip units on an appropriate scale for suchminor duties without impairing our general readiness for war.   This part  is developed latere
(CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING- ACTION OH L&amp;ND. 12.     We now turn to the question of whether lend operations will,  in fact, be required in. the first year or war.    Operations on land ere apt, to be considered in terns of national armies engaged in trench warfare on the Continent.   We think that a broader view of the responsibilities  of the Array in the defence- of the Empire should be - constantly in mind,..when plans are under                       -   i consideration. 13.     Throughout our history we have always had to provide land forces to undertake operations in support of our sea power.    History abounds in examples, of expeditions-puLanned with the object of safeguarding our oversea bases,  of reinforcing--our-.garriso:o.s and of-securing our sea coinauni cat ions o   Our Empire still depends for its existence on the same sea communications, but whereas in the past we had generaldejm-s u_c_e.ee ded in limiting the challenge to our sea power to one area of the globe while enjoying comparative quiet elsewhere, we now find ourselves  faced with the.possibility of having to ward off simultanous attacks on widely separated parts of our Empire.    The Par East,  the Mediterranean and Home waters may all  become the scene of operations in a future war and the Empire will be strained to the utmost in maintaining its position.   In the early days of a major war we may, therefore, well find ourselves faced with urgent demands  for our land forces for operations in support of our  sea power in more than one quarter, 14.     Events in the Middle East have, in recent years, raised new dangers for the Empire-    Our supremacy in                    -9-
the Mediterranean has been challenged, the attitude of theArab world is doubtful, and attempts might be madeto attack our position in Egypt which is vital to our air communications.    Under thesecircumstances, no-one can state with certainty thatdemands on&apos; our Empire for reinforcements to the middle east will not have to.be met before the outbreak of a war or soon afterwards.,      ;   ,                       ;  p/..pi;:: :.;.i w15.    Finally, the attitude which we may have to adopt towards France will involve us in amomentous decision on the outbreak of war.    Recentdespatches from H.M. Ambassador in Paris have drawn attention to the change which has taken place in themilitary situation on the Continent  as a result of events in Czechoslovakia,    At a recent meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence^ the Foreign Secretary put forward theview that the French attitude towards us might change ifthey were left with the impression that it was they whomust bear the brunt of the fighting and slaughter on land.16*    France, faced with Germany and Italy, whosecombined populations total 125 millions, might well give  upthe unequal struggle unless supported with the assurance that we should assist them to our utmost.    It isdifficult to avoid the conclusion that such assistancemay  have to include support by land forces if only forthe moral effect which would thereby be produced on theFrench  nation.    /17.   In establishing the role which the Army was designed to fulfil, the Cabinet in 1937 placed fourth onthe list, to be provided after other objectives had been met, co-operation in the defence of -the territories ofour allies.    In this connection,  however, v/e would point         C.I.I). 341st Meeting, Minute 2.
                                                       i dout  that if France were over-run by Germany and forced  toher  knees, not only would the further prosecution of thewar  be compromised, but we should have already failed inone  of the main objects for which we entered  the war,namely, the defence of Prance,   The situation produced by the possession of the French ports by Germany would  beso grave that the prevention of such a situation weconsioler might more truly be included under the first ofthe  four priorities defined by the Cabinet, namely, &quot;the corner-stone of our Imperial Defence policy is to maintainthe  security of the United Kingdom,, &quot;   It is  difficult  tosay  how this security could be maintained if  France were forced to capitulate and therefore the protection of theUnited Kingdom may have to include a share in the  landdefence  of French,  territory,18,     It is never possible to forecast the course whichwill be taken by warlike operations^    We believe, however,that there will almost certainly be many demands on our land forces-, some of them conflicting and some of a ne.turewhich we shall be unable to refuse, butWar  13 a :zatter of seizing opportunities when xhey:present themselves..    If we do not have land  forces available to take the field in the first year of war, notonly may we lose the war through being unable to counter theenemy !s major offensive s   but we maybe prevented from seisinggood  opportunities for offensive action overseas.Failure to take advantage of such opportunities may greatlylengthen the duration of the war0            COMPOSITIOII Off OUR LA.HD FORCES.19,,     It remains to consider the size and composition  ofthe  land forces which should be provided and  equipped  inpeace  for war.
       The size of the Regular Army in peace-time is determined by a number of factors which will not allow ofany substantial increase.   The size of the Field army which can be procured from the Regular Army is conditionedby the number of units which, under the Cardweil system,are to be found in this country.       The size of the Territorial Army is largely governed by the number of recruits obtainable in peace-time,   Itsformations are spread so that the whole country is covered.       &quot;,/e do not think it profitable to examine whether anincrease in the. size of the Army we maintain in peace-timecould &quot;be secured.   On the other hand, we should stronglydeprecate any suggestion that it should be decreased.The moral effect of any such reduction at the present time would be bad, nor is such a reduction  justifiable  on military grounds.   Ve are therfore committed to an army at home comprising five Regular Divisions and a MobileDivision and thirteen Territorial Divisions, apart fromthe five Territorial A.A. Divisions,20.   Y/e  now. consider how to dispose  of these formationsand how they should be equipped to meet the demands whichwe think will be made on the Army in war-time.       Our Territorial system precludes any unit of theTerritorial Army being ready to take the field at theoutbreak of war.   On the assumption that the requisitetraining equipment is immediately available, it isestimated that four months is the minimum time in whicha Territorial Division could complete  its training,,Therefore during the first four months of war we are limited to our Regular Army striking force which isat present organised in two contingents, each of two
Divisions, plus one Mobile Division accompanying the firstcontingent.,   &quot;&apos;e are strongly of opinion that the whole ofthis striking force should be completely equipped for warwith full reserves.,   We consider that the acceptance ofa lesser standard than this would restrict in. a dangerousmanner the possibilities of our action on land and might even lead under certain circumstances to the sending ofa force into action without its complete equipment, a stateof affairs that might have the gravest consequences.21.    Turning now to the Territorial Army, there are two factors which point to the necessity for ensuring that a portion of it, at any rate, will be ready for war as soonas it can be sufficiently trained..,   First, we may be calledupon to reinforce garrisons overseas or to relieve theRegulars  in these garrisons by Territorials as happened in1914.   Secondly, as soon as the Regular Army is engagedin operations either in support of sea power or on theContinent, we could not willingly accept a situationwhereby no reserve of trained troops existed for the wholeof the first year of war0   The limiting factor should bethe time  required to train the units rather then, the time required  to produce their war equipment and we recommendthat a contingent of four divisions should be fully equipped..   This entails striking a balance between the equipment  that can bo produced on the one hand during thefirst four months of the war, in addition to  that required.to maintain the Regular Array in the field during the sameperiod, and on the other hand the amount which should beheld ready in peace022.    With regard to the rest of the Territorial Army, weconsider  that it will be sufficient if  they can be given.
the full scale of training equipment  which they  wouldrequire on embodiment.   We think it would be  very  difficultto defend the continuance of the present  position  whereby the existing Territorial Force could  not  be providedimmediately on the outbreak of war with adequate equipment for training.23.     The employment  of these divisions will depend  uponthe development of the  military operations, and we wouldnot propose that full war equipment for these divisions should be provided so rapidly as for  the  first fourT.A.  divisions.  If the industrial capacity required forthe recommendations we  have made for  the  Regular Armyand the first four divisions of&quot;the Territorial Army iscreated,, the production of war equipment  for  theremaining nine divisions would be automatically accelerated.34.     Finally we revert to the question already  referredto in Paragraph 11 which may be termed the day-to-day  needsof Imperial Defence on  land.  In order to meet thesewithout impairing our general readiness for war  it isnecessary that formations should be established fromthose units of the Regular Army which are not incorporated in the Field Force, of  such a nature  and equipped  in  sucha manner as to undertake the duties which constantlyfall to the lot of the  Regular Army in peace-time.  the equipment of these divisions, though  on a scale suitablefor Imperial duties rather than for war against a  first class pov/er, should nevertheless include those items of clothing and general equipment which will  enable them toproceed immediately to  any part of the world.                     -14-
25.     To summarise,  we express the needs  of  the army as follows:-Regular Army.            (a)   Field Force,Full equipment and fullreserves on the outbreakof war.(h)   Colonial  Force.     Equipped  for Imperial     duties in any part  of     the world.4 DivisionsTerritorial Army.Remainder of territorial A.rmy.Full equipment and fullreserves at 4 monthsafter outbreak of war.Complete trainingequipment on theoutbreak of war.       SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR&apos;S RECOMMENDATIONS.26.     We can now examine the proposals of the Secretaryof State for War as set out in the Memorandum under reportin the light of the foregoing considerations.  His firstproposal is to reconstitute the Mobile Division into  twoof a smaller size.  We have not examined this proposal indetail-   We consider that the composition and equipment of the Field Force should be complete and up-to-date.The details are, we think, the concern of the Secretary ofState for War and we are prepared to accept his recommendations on this point.27.     The second proposal is that the first contingent of the Field Force should be given complete equipment and reserves for modern warfare against first-classpowers, snd the third proposal requests a similar scale
 of  equipment for  the second contingent.   We have stated our considered opinion that the whole Regular Field Force should be equipped in every way for modern war and that it should be ready to take the field as early as possible after the outbreak of war.   We therefore support these proposals. 23.   The fourth proposal is to establish two Colonial Divisions equipped for an Imperial duties scale, one of which would be located as a reserve in the Middle East and the other at home.   These Divisions would be composed of units not earmarked for the Field Force.    They would meet the need., to vhich we have drawn attention, of enabling the Army to undertake its Imperial duties in peace-time without interfering with our readiness for war.   We support this recommendation. 29.   Finally the Secretary of State asks for war equipment and reserves for four Divisions of the TerritorialArmy and for full training equipment for the remainder.We have remarked that it would not be possible for any territorial Division to take the field until four months after the outbreak of war on account of the necessity for completing its training.     (If training equipment on a scale sufficient for all the units of the Division when  . embodied is not immediately forthcoming,  this period of four months will be considerably lengthened.)    To satisfy the demands which will be made on our Land Forces in the opening phases of a great war,  we consider thatthis period of four months is the maximum which should be accepted before some Territorial Divisions are ready toproceed overseas on active service.   We therefore                       -16-
recommend that industrial capacity should be set up and orders placed  in peace  in a manner calculated to ensure thatthe provision  of war equipment and rererve^ for fourTerritorial Divisions will be completed four months afterthe outbreak of war.   We have stated our opinion on theneed for full training equipment for the whole TerritorialArmy and we therefore endorse the Secretary of State forWar&apos;s proposal on this point,                        (S i gn ed)  C,L.N.
