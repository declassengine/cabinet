THIS TOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .SECRET.CP. 53(39).                                          COPY NO.    &quot;0 &apos;                            CABINET,               THE establishments SIB/TENT OF A ..MINISTRY OF SUPPLY                              IN PEACE, c             Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination                             of Defence,,         .A: V :&apos;AV&quot;        :I-A;,           &apos;     .3  . -      - *                In a separate memorandum I have submitted to the Cabinet         papers showing what passed on this question at the last meeting         of the Committee of Imperial Defence0         2,     In paragraphs 7 - 14 of Paper CP.  234 (38) of the         21st October,  I endeavoured to sum up the  arguments for and         against setting up a Ministry of supply in peace as I then saw         therrio   The decision of the Government against it was stated by         the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 17th of         November and was accompanied by an announcement of the appoint-         ment of a panel of industrialists to help  with advice as to the         execution of the rearmament programme, among other things.    I         may add that this panel was duly appointed before the end of the         year, has been busily engaged in a survey  of the position of the         programme, and is I understand,  considering a statement to the         Prime Minister,  as to their progress,         3.     There is,  I should apprehend, an argument for setting-         up a Ministry  of Supply at  once on the political ground that -         it would be acceptable to some strong currents of opinion in         the House of Commons and that it would have a steadying effect -         on public opinion here and  also some effect on public opinion         abroad.    My colleagues in  the Cabinet can judge the force of         these considerations as well as  I can.  They were,  I think,         present in the minds of Ministers who at  the meeting of the         Committee of Imperial Defence desired that the issue should                          s  cp  23 (39) o                                  -1-
again go to the Cabinet0   There&apos; was also present, I think,the feeling that the situation has so far changed for the worse since October that the decision then made does not hold good now.   There was also the feeling that, if weare anyhow to envisage a Ministry of Supply in war, its establishment in war conditions would be so difficult an operation  as to make it most advisable that the outbreakof war should find it already established mid running as a unit of administration,,4.     It may be useful to summarise what would he.required to be decided and done before a Ministry of Supplycan now be established,,       (i)  A decision is needed whether it is to include             supply for the Navy, Army and Air Force or             only for some of these (in the last war the             Admiralty stood out from the Minis-.try of             Munitions)a      (ii)  A decision is needed whether the supply in             question is to befall forms of supply \or only             those parts, of supply which call or- may call             for extensive diversion of the engineering,.             chemical and metallurgical industries from             their normal spheres (in the last war these             latter were transferred to the Ministry of             Munitions and the rest were left in the Service             Dep ar tmen t s)c     (iii)  A decision is needed whether in addition to the             function of simply and the corresponding funciion             of inspection, tine function of design and             research is also to be transferred  (in the last             war supply inspection and design were all             transferred to the Ministry of Munitions for             the Army and the Air Force)n
       (iv)  A decision is needed whether the Ministry is or            /  is not to have compulsory powers over industry              and as to the scope and extent of those powers,              if to he given0        (v)  When the ahove matters are decided, legislation          ^.1__will have to he drafted and carried through                            , 1     \    -  .              Parliament embodying the decision v/whatever it              may be,0       (vi)  The sections of the Service Departments whose              functions are under the decision to he \              transferred to the Ministry of Supply will              require to he sorted out so far as this has not              already &quot;been done, so that the transfer of their              allegiance to a new Ministry can be effected on              an appointed day, and it will be necessary to              select and appoint officers to take charge of              the central departments requisite in a Ministry -              Secretariat, Finance, Labour and so forth,5a     The processes indicated under (vi) could, I think,be carried out contemporaneously with the passage of thelegislation under (v)0   Any estimate of the time which itwould take to complete (v) and (vi) must be provisional butI should judge that one must anticipate something like two to three months before the Ministry could start workings  Itis also to be remembered that the departmental officers concerned in carrying out these processes are officers already working at high pressure on the rearmament programme and thepreparation of a war potential,,   Therefore the work ofestablishing a Ministry of Supply must inevitably slow down the work last mentioned and this is so obviously inadvisablethat it has been so far in my mind a strong argument againstthe establishment of a Ministry of Supply in peacec
                                                     t u 6C     As to the four points noted in paragraph (4) above as needing a decision, I may recall as regards (i) that&apos; in my paper CP. 234(38) above mentioned I impressed the view that the Admiralty should remain outside a Ministry of Supply in peace, and also, at all events at the outset, in war.    As regards (It).&quot; the view so far taken throughout by the Supply Organisation of the Committee of Imperial Defence has been that  the supply transferred to a Ministry of Supply should not be all supply but that part of it which calls for the diversion of industry from its normal tasks, As to  (ill),  the view taken  has been  that if supply is transferred,  the corresponding inspection and  design functions  must  be transferred with itc   While it has been agreed that the transfer of  these functions  is essential  to  an effective  Ministry of Supply,  it  is also generally  accepted that the transfer of design raises difficult  questions of  departmental responsibility0 The  claim  of  the  Admiralty to  design  battleships,  or of the  Air Ministry  to  design bombers is so  strong that it should not be over- ruled except on grounds of  strong public necessity, 70     Point  (Iv)  --  compulsory powers - is of  great difficulty and I may  usefully  say  something as  to it * 8.     I dismiss  first as  wholly  impracticable any idea that we  could obtain  compulsory  cowers  over  lab^ur^Whatever Germany may be able to do, I  think  heat we have in this country to bring in labour by persuasion  and agreement and not by compulsionc   This was ma.de  clear in the last war and  seems to me even  clearer now  thati itwas thenc
                                                    1 Q        At the same time it is,  I understand,  the strong view of the Minister of Labour  that if  a  single  Ministry of Supply should not) be established,  then his task  of securing on a basis of goodwill the additional labour for rearmament would he much facilitate do    This  is obviously a point of the first  importance and I  must leave it to the Minister of Labour  to develop itc. Clearly, however,  the  advantages which  the  Minister of Labour has  in mind would only be fully  secured if the Ministry of Supply embraced all three Defence Departments, 9,      Compulsion,  if  compulsion there  is to  be, must  thus,  I  think,  be  considered as having application to  industry only0 10e     The  reason  why  such  compulsion was found necessary in  the last war was the decision  of  policy to  deploy abroad a huge  land army,  and  the  assumption that  it  will  be necessary to do  so  again  lies  at the root of much of  the  argument in favour  of  a Ministry of Supply.   But the policy so far approved by  the Cabinet has been  quite different,    The question has been again under consideration  by the Chiefs of Staff,    They are proposing  a moderate  increase in  the land forces for the  effective use of which  in war,without  quite inordinate delay,  money must  be found for advance supply arrangements  in peacet    But,  so far as I know, nobody has proposed that even in a war against  a major power, we should raise.land forces in any way comparable to those which we  succeeded in
deploying in the last war.    This is,  I think,the point underlying the conclusion 2(b)(ii) of the345th meeting of the C.I.D. that       &quot;the assumption on which the Committee          of Imperial Defence &quot;based their          previous conclusion in February 1938          on the question of supply organisation          in war appeared to require further          consideration in present circumstances&quot;          (C.I.D. 330th/Meeting, Minute 1(a)).To provide for the land forces so far suggested,I should not myself think it requisite to applycompulsion to industry in peace.   The othersphere in which considerable expansion of peacesupplies will still be required is the Royal AirForce.   Whether compulsion in industry in peace is required either to provide for that expansionor to provide for the yet unsatisfied demands ofthe Air Ministry war potential is a matter onwhich the Secretary of State for Air can betteradvise my colleagues than I can.   His taslc would no doubt be facilitated by the possession of such powers but when full allowance is made for hisrequirements and for the requirements of any landforce so far in contemplation, I should myselfdoubt whether the case for compulsion now is so strong as to override the objections to it - thedifficulty of differential application to this or that firm of a power which must be taken ingeneral terms,  the voiding of running contracts,and the effect on our export trade, the preservation of which as long as possible is after all essentialto our power to fight a long war.
11;    The concession of compulsory powers overindustry is not of course essential to theestablishment of a Ministry of Supply.   Such aMinistry could be set up with a simple transfer ofthe existing powers of the Service Ministers to anew Minister.   There would be some advantage in this,not least in the fact that if it could be got runningbefore the emergency is upon us, the transfer to war conditions would be easier, and it would also be easier to complete the arrangements for the addition to theMinistry of Supply in war of the Ministry already approved for war to control and supply as requisiteraw materials and articles of common user by theServices.12.    I have not thought it right, for obvious reasons, to express definite opinions on the difficult questions discussed in this Memorandum.                    (Intd. )  T.W.H.I.28th January 1959.
