Memorandum by the Minister for Go^                         ordination of Defence.                 Following  a  discussion  at the Committee  of Imperial            Defence  on  19th January,  1939, on the  first Interim Report            of  the reconstituted  Sub-Committee on  the Evacuation            of  Government Departments in the  Event of War (of which            Sir James Rae,  K.C.B.,  is Chairman)  rny predecessor            undertook to submit a paper  to the Cabinet drawing            attention to the  assumptions on which the Report was            framed and  seeking  Cabinet directions regarding the            basis  on which  the  Sub-Committee  should continue its            work.            2.   The problem of the location of Government Departments            in  time  of  war  has  been before the Cabinet and Committee            of  Imperial Defence on a number of occasions and the            current  proposals are the result of a review undertaken            in  the light of experiences  during 1933.            3.   Before considering the nature of these proposals            I wish to  draw  particular attention to the question of            the time at which a move from the central area would-            or  could take  place.    In their Report, dated             10th February,  1937^ the Sub-Committee under Sir James Rae                    H C.I.D. Paper No. 304-A.                    / C.I.D- Paper No. D.P.(P.)  14.-1-
referred to this matter in the following terms:-           &quot;During the        of strained              relations it is to be              presumed that no move to the              selected positions in the              suburbs would be possible,              as such action would be              interpreted both at home              and abroad to mean that the              Government considered war              inevitable.   The move, therefore,              cannot take place until after              the outbreak of hostilities,              which is the period when the              greatest intensity of air attack              is to be expected, and yet the              period immediately preceding              the outbreak of war, even              without the complications of              air attack is the period when              the pressure of work on all              Government Departments is at its              maximum, and when the greatest              efficiency and despatch is              required in the whole Government              machine ........................              These considerations alone appear              to us to be likely to cause the              Government to hesitate before              giving the order for the move,              but there are also other factors              of a political nature likely to              have the same effect;  e.g., the              Government of the day will have              to consider whether the move can              be carried out without an announce-              ment being made at the same time              that the civil population would              be evacuated pari passu, and if              so whether both operations could              in fact be carried out simultaneously                       It     This report was accepted in principle by theCommittee of Imperial Defence though the recordedconclusions make no specific reference to thetime of a possible move.4.   After the first Czechoslovakian emergency atthe end of May, 1938, further attention was givento the location of the operational staffs of theService Departments and the Home Office on the
outbreak of a war, and a report&apos;&quot; by the Chiefs of staff was discussed by the Committee of Imperial Defence on27th July, 1938, at which it was made clear that unlessthe move  of these Departments under the &quot;Eae plan&quot; - whichwould take a week or ten days to carry out - could becompleted before the outbreak of hostilities, it wouldhave to be postponed until after the critical initial period was over and then carried out as circumstancespermitted.5.   The foundations on which both the short and longterm plans of the current report^ of Sir James Rae&apos;s Sub-Committee have been framed are as follows:-        (a)  It is not certain that the Whitehall               area will be the object of the enemy&apos;s               initial and/or maximum attack in view               of the alternatives of docks, essential               communication and distributing centres,               and targets of a purely military               character.        (b)  The active anti-aircraft defences of               this country are rapidly becoming               much stronger, and may cause an               enemy attacking London serious and               disproportionate losses.        (c)  Civil evacuation from the London area              . is only to be encouraged within               definite limits, and it is hoped               that economic and industrial               activities will not be wholly               discontinued in this area.        (d)  Accordingly, and having regard also               to the difficulty of moving from               peace-time headquarters in the               period of strained relations and               to the imperative necessity for               the outbreak of hostilities not               finding the Service Departments               half-way through a move, it is               assumed that at the start of the               war Government Departments will               be in Whitehall and will have               to remain there through the               initial period of fighting.        (e)  If, however, the Central Area becomes               untenable, it is assumed that  an               area so close to the central area               as that of the north-west suburbs               will virtually be equally untenable.                 KC.I.D. Paper No. 14-50-B.                 /CLB, Paper No. 304-A.
        (f) Accordingly,  if a general move  from  the             Whitehall area becomes necessary It             is proposed to move  at once to  the             provinces.   This will, incidentally,             have  the  advantage of avoiding  a             double move, first to the  suburbs             and then  to the provinces .6.      On this basis,  the short-term plan  now proposedcan be  summarised  as.follows :-        Apart from  .small  insurance  reserve  parties from,the Service and Home Security organisations  which will.leave the Whitehall area unobtrusively before the outbreakof hostilities, Departments will  stay in their presentquarters..until evacuation becomes necessary  by reason of,the intensity^of enemy attack.  (in the case of theService and Home Security-Departments the  move must. be postponed until &quot;after&apos;.the initial  stages of  the war ifthe gravest results on the- conduct of war  operations areto be avoided).  Accommodation is  earmarked  in  thenorth-wastsmsuburbs to&apos; which essential staffs of the moreimportant Departments could go if  their offices were sodamaged as to be unusable and if  the extent  of the damagegenerally in the VVhitehall area were not sufficient to compel  the move of the Government  as a whole.        Basements of offices in the London  area, where these exist,are now being strengthened and mechanicallyventilated to provide refuge accommodation for theiroccupants.  In addition,  the Service Departments arebeing provided with protected war  rooms and  workingaccommodation for  the vital nucleus which  must continueworking without interruption.  This accommodation willgive very substantial protection, adequate  against everythingexcept  a direct hit. Priority for  this purpose is being given to the Service Departments and. other Departments directly concerned with the war.  The work  is making  good progress                          -4-                1
and  the strengthening of the basements in the service departments Headquarters will be complete by the end ofFebruary.  Schemes are now in hand for the great majorityof headquarter staffs in London and work is just startingin vulnerable towns in the Provinces also.       At the outbreak of hostilities, arrangements willbe made for staff not required for essential duties toremain at their homes for a few days until it is seen how the  situation develops.       If it becomes necessary to move the seat of Govern-ment, essential staffs and certain other staff of service departments will go to the Western Counties, the remaindergoing to the Midlands and North Western Counties.       The Office of Works have earmarked the necessarybuildings and in many cases are now making a survey ofthem.  Detailed arrangements for the actual move are beingworked out by Departments with the Ministry of Transport.7.     The Committee of Imperial Defence as a whole approved.this short-term plan although some members felt seriousBBbsrapprehensions about the possibility of carrying on anybusiness in the Central area after the outbreak of hos-tilities.   There appears, however, to be no alternative.       I ask, therefore, the Cabinet to accept the hypoth-esis on which the short-term plan is based and- to confirm the approval given by the Committee of Imperial Defence.Long-Term Plan.8.     There remains for consideration the basis of thelong-term plan.  In their interim report the Rae Committeecontemplate for this -purpose,       (a) that the strengthening of basements in             the Central area, so as to provides             as indicated above, adequate protection             from everything save a direct hit should             be completed on the widest possible scale.       (b) the location in peace-time outside London             of staff not really required in London.         K C.I.D.  344th Mtg., Minute (10),
                                                        JL ^ ^9,     Under both plans the outbreak of war will find theessential Headquarters Staffs of Government Departmentslocated in the Central area.  It will be seen that theonly fundamental difference between the long-term andthe short-term plan would be that under the former, staffswhich are not really required in London in peace-time(still less in war-time; will be located permanently inthe provinces in accommodation to which the staffs inLondon at the outbreak of a war can move, if a move from london becomes necessary.10.    As regards decentralisation in peace-time, mycolleagues will be aware that this proposal was definitelyrejected by a Cabinet Committee35 in 1936 and again, by implication, in the summer of 1938, when the scheme forlocating the Air Ministry outside London was disapprovedby the Committee of Imperial Defence.^  Nevertheless theexperience of September, 1938, has led to a change of departmental outlook and I feel that the time has come toadopt as part of a definite policy the location outside ofLondon of all staffs whose presence in the Central area isnot essential in peace-time.  The process must necessarily be a slow one as new buildings will have to be constructed^and it will be a matter of some years before it can be com-pleted.  The new buildings should be erected in theProvinces where Departments and branches remaining inLondon would move if the Government were forced in a war to leave London.11.    As regards reserve bomb-proof basements in thenorth-west suburb area which it is proposed to provide in certain new Government buildings, it might be argued that, as this area will not be used under the currentproposals as a general evacuation centre for the         * Cabinet 73(36) and 7(37).         ^ C.I.D. 325th Mtg.                     -6-
Government machine as a whole, the construction of bomb-.proof basements is not necessary.   It must be remembered,however, that if any of the war rooms in Whitehall were damaged or their communications put out of action therewould, in the absence of these reserve protected base-ments in the north-west suburbs, be no means of carryingon in London the vital work of the Service department concerned.   For this reason the Service Departmentsattach great importance to the completion of these reservewar rooms and their provision may well assist the Govern-ment to function in London longer than would otherwisehe possible.12.    If, as recommended aspart of the long-term plan,essential staffs are to remain in London at the beginningof a war, I consider that steps should be taken to constructin the Whitehall area deep bomb-proof accommodation forthe five War Rooms.   Any extension of such accomodation to provide for other personnel must await an investigation into its cost, practicability and need in the light of thegeneral Goverriment policy on this matter.13.    The question of taking special steps to ensurethat certain vital communications are carried at such adepth as to be safe from any air attack is at present under active consideration but detailed plans cannot yet be submitted.14.    A suggestion has been made that an &quot;intermediate&quot;plan might be elaborated to bridge a gap between the short and long-term plans.   In fact there is no suchgap and, if time permits,  the short and long-term planswill he developed simultaneously until they merge into
each other.-  The only alternative to this gradual mergingwould he the decentralisation of Government Staffs in thenear future in peace time to the provinces &quot;before new buildings were ready to receive them.   This would mean the compulsory acquisition - for it would be impossibleto acquire them by voluntary means - of a large number of schools and practically all the big hotels in the localityselected..   Such a move would lead to great aoininistrativeinconvenience and much public outcry.   It is in my judgment quite impracticable and cannot be recommended.SUMMARY.15.     Summing up, the questions on which I desireguidance from my colleagues are set out below.    answers to these must be given before the details of short and long-term plans for the location of Government departments in time of war can be finally settled.Short-term plan.     (a)  Can it be assumed that at the outbreak of war            Government Departments will remain in the            central area?     (b)  Is it agreed that if it becomes necessary to            move the Government machine as a whole from            Central London, the move should be direct to the            provinces and not to the north-west suburbs?Long-term plan.     (a)  Can it be assumed that the Departments and            Headquarter Branches remaining in London            in peace-time will remain in the central            area on the outbreak of hostilities and, if            so,, in the event of the Government machine            having to leave London, will they move            direct to the provinces?
richmond Terrace,  S.W.1*,   15th February, 1939.(b) Is it agreed that  all  Government Departments      and branches  of  Departments not  really-      required in London should  be  located  in      peace-time in the  provinces as soon as      practicable?(c) Should provision be  made  for deep,  bomb-proof      shelters in the  central area  for the  five      War Rooms of  the Cabinet,  Service Depart-      ments and Home Security Organisation  as  a      minimum (any extension  depending on      further investigation asto cost, practic-      ability and need in the light of the  general      Government policy  in this  matter).
