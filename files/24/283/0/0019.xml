THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1939.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.C;P. 46 (39).CABINET.SITUATION  IN  SPAIN.     I WOULD ask my colleagues to consider, as a matter of urgency, the recent developments of the situation in Spain.     2.  By his rapid military successes since last December General Franco isnow master of the  whole of Catalonia,  thus completely cutting off the  territorypf Government Spain from any land connection  with foreign countries.   Hissupremacy in the air is well established,  and by means of a species of air blockadeas well as by his control of the sea he is,  despite the fact that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have so far refused to accord him belligerent rights, in fact cutting off Government Spain from communication by sea with the outside world.     3.  The Spanish Republican Government now hold only the  Central territory,.including the capital, Madrid, together with the  ports of Valencia, Cartagena,Alineria and  Alicante.  Their  armies  in  Catalonia  have  collapsed,  and  theyhave lost Minorca by a bloodless surrender.  The President has fled into France,the Government have been scattered but have now collected, round the Premierand Minister for Foreign Affairs within their own territory.  To what extent theinhabitants there  remain  faithful to their cause it  is difficult  to say.   TheCommander of the Government forces appears publicly to be supporting  thePremier&apos;s announced determination to fight to a finish.  But the fact that he hasprivately  asked His  Majesty&apos;s Government and the French  Government  for permission  to enter their  countries indicates  that  he is  alive to the  possiblenecessity of providing for his own safety, and our recent reports suggest that theCommunist supporters of the Government  are the only well-drilled party which still desires to continue the struggle.. The powers of resistance of  the people ofMadrid and Valencia must obviously have  been severely strained and may wellbe reaching their limits. Any further resistance can in  any case hardly be greatlyprolonged, and it would seem  that the only result of further prolongation mustbe more useless suffering and loss of life.     4.  The question therefore arises  whether  the  military situation  and  theposition of the Republican Government do or do  not justify His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in proceeding to  the recognition of General Franco&apos;s government as the Government  of Spain.     5.  On the one hand  it may be held that, as the capital still holds out andthe Republican Government remains in existence, the conditions,  which would justify such recognition, are not yet fulfilled, and that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be subject to serious criticism, if they took so  discouraging a step so longas that Government were able to put up any show  of a fight.  This criticismmight  grow and spread in the event of some  valiant and prolonged  feat  of resistance  by  Spanish Republican forces,  such as the holding out of  Madridagainst siege in face of all the horrors  and deprivations endured.     6.  As against this it  may be doubted  whether  too much attention need bepaid to the  criticism  of  those  who  throughout  this  conflict  have in  general1condemned the policy of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  and persistently  accusedthem of partiality in favour of General Franco.       10259  [18663]
in; 1  7;; ^However long and gallant the further resistance of Spanish Government forces maybe &quot;there can be no doubt now as to the final issue; and there may bei incalculable advantages in facing that issue now rather than later.  So long as His Majesty&apos;s Government maintain  their  present  attitude towards General Franco&apos;s administration, they are impotent to promote that  which must be one of the principal purposes of British policy in Spain i.e., the effective combating of German and  Italian  influence with General Franco&apos;s  regime.   We  have much headway to make up  if we are  to establish friendly relations with,  and secure fair treatment for British interests in, the New Spain: and it is therefore of primary importance to efface as soon  as possible the bitterness at  present prevailing against His Majesty&apos;s.government among General Franco&apos;s adherents.  .:  Recognition  by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government might, moreover, if accorded forthwith, have some  effect in bringing hostilities to an earlier close.     8.   I should  suppose  that Germany and  Italy would find it difficult to takeovert exception to our action, which would merely bring us into line with what they have  already done,  although they will probably dislike what  they will certainly regard as our belated bid to snatch from them, and secure for  ourselves,the fruits of General Franco&apos;s favour. This anticipation is supported by Germanand Italian reactions to the Minorca episode, and may be regarded as an additionalargument for the  course I recommend.     9.   My conclusion, therefore,  is that there is very  much more to be gainedthan there  is to be risked  by early recognition of General Franco.     10.   If my colleagues are agreed with me  in favouring this  step, I amdisposed to urge that subject to French concurrence it  should be taken forthwith. The longer  we delay, the less value will our action have in General Franco&apos;s eyes;the more time will be afforded to Germany and  Italy to dig themselves in; and meanwhile  an obvious opportunity for  action may pass.   The full advantages to be derived from recognition of General Franco by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand by British interests in Spain can only be obtained if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment can take the initiative,  and at the earliest date, in granting this recognition.The Duke of Alba has repeatedly assured us, as  we believe on instructions fromBurgos, not only that this is General Franco&apos;s Own wish, but that he is anxiousto  be recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government before the French or any other government take  this step.  It is only by our taking this initiative,  in conjunc-tion, as I should think necessary, with the French, and leading the way for others to  follow, that we can to  some extent wipe out the  past from General Franco&apos;mind, and embark on our new relations with him on an equal footing with others,and perhaps even  with an advantage over some.     11.   But  time presses.  For  other Governments are rapidly  moving in thesame direction.   The Government of Eire  have announced their  intention torecognise General Franco forthwith, and  the Czechoslovak  Government havetaken this step already.  The Argentine Government  have decided to withdraw their representative from  the Spanish Republican Government, and it is conse-quently  to be  anticipated  that other Governments in  Europe and America will shortly be making similar moves.                                   &quot;   -     12.   The  French  Government have recently sent an unofficial representative to  General Franco, whom the latter, however, has only  received as a  private individual.  He has intimated clearly that he will accept from  France, whose attitude during the civil conflict he regards as having been unfriendly and evenhostile, nothing less than  full recognition and the French Government, who are anxious to establish correct relations with him, have informed us that they intend to  despatch a  further mission to him this week in order to renew discussions oil their future  official relations; &apos; His  Majesty&apos;s Government are keeping in the closest  touch  with  the  French  Government  on  the question, . and  I  have communicated to  them my view that recognition, when  it  is accorded,  should be based on the actual facts of the situation and therefore be unconditional. ; I hopethat the  views of the two Governments on  this point will be found  to coincide, and I think I may say that they will keep  in step in regard to the  time  and&apos; character of any action they may decide to take.     13.  In these circumstances  I would urge that, subject to agreement with the French Government, it should be decided to inform General Franco that  His
Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to accord him full recognition and to accreditan Ambassador to him without delay.  It will in that event be courteous to giveour  ally Portugal, who is Spain&apos;s only other  neighbour,  prior  notice of  our intention.                                                                 ;&apos;     14.  I think that, in  any statement which  we might later decide  to make,we should be able to express the  satisfaction with which His Majesty&apos;s Goverh-ment had noted the public statements made by General Franco on the points towhich attention here is likely to be principally directed, i,e.  :       (i) the integrity and independence of Spain;     (ii) the eventual withdrawal of foreign combatants;     (iii) the abstention from anything in the way of general political reprisals.               ..,   &apos;VV-&apos;.                          .                     H.     February 13, 1939.
