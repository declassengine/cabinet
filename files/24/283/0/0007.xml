At a meeting  of  the  Foreign  Policy Committee of the Cabinet on 26th _-79 January, 1939, I/was invited to examine further what is the shortest  time within ..JMOP-which our Field Force could arrive in France.                                      5    2. My colleagues will recall that during the conversations in Paris on 24thNovember, 1938, M. Daladier, while accepting that it was not yet possible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to make any very great  effort in the matter of assistanceto France on land,  pressed the Prime  Minister &quot; to  arrange  .  .  .  for/expertdiscussions to be continued by which it might be found possible lor Great britain to despatch two divisions to  France at least as early as the eighth day after theoutbreak, of  hostilities.&quot;  In reply the  Prime Minister agreed that further talksshould take place.*    .3. Up. to the present the preparation of the Field  Force for war  is governed by the decision of 23rd March, 1938, in which the Cabinet approved generally therecommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence &quot; to approve the proposalsof the War Office for the equipment for general purposes of formations of theField Force as follows :      (a) Two  Regular divisions and one mobile division with full war reserves  of           ammunition ready to embark in 21 days.     (b) Two Regular divisions with war reserves of ammunition at half the           scale of (a),  ready to embark in 40 days.&quot;     Cabinet   approval,  however, was  qualified  by  the proviso  that &quot; the priority  laid down  by the  Minister for Co-ordination of Defence&quot;  (i.e.,  in cp.  316  (37)) &quot; still holds good and that the  expenditure involved in the newrecommendations  has to be met within those priorities and  within the financewhich can be provided for the Army&quot;.     Difficulty has, moreover, arisen in  implementing this decision owing to thedifficulty of  translating into practice  the principle  embodied in the  phrase&quot; equipment for general purposes &quot;.  This has arisen in regard to specializedrequirements.     4. The present situation as regards  the Field Force is as follows :           Until the  end of  1939 the  rearmament  position will  not  permit the     despatch in the early  months of a war of more than a force,  known  as     the  &quot; Intermediate  Contingent&quot;,  of two  infantry  divisions  with  certain     auxiliary and ancillary troops.          Plans exist for the despatch of this force to France immediately after     the  despatch of the Advanced Air Striking Force,  and  provide for  its     arrival in the Assembly Area to be completed by the 30th day after mobilization-     tion.  In present circumstances  the Advanced Air Striking Force and the     Intermediate Contingent cannot be  despatched  simultaneously  and, since     the operations  of  the  former will have an important bearing on the  air     defence of Great Britain, its despatch has been given priority.                             * CP. 269 (38).

    5. When the complete Field Force, i.e:, 4 divisions and 1 mobile division, is re-armed  and ready  for  despatch  it cannot, under  present  arrangements, be assembled overseas before the 52nd day of mobilization.    6.  The  measures proposed in  my  Paper  CP. 27 (39)  if sanctioned,  willnot materially affect the rate of movement overseas of the Field Force.    7.  The adoption of the following measures would accelerate the movementof the Field Force so that the Intermediate  Contingent could be assembled in19 days and the full Field Force in 31 days:-    (a) Provision of further escort vessels by the Admiralty.    (fo) Designing and  building of special ships for  carrying motor transport,          into and from which motor vehicles can  be driven without having          recourse to the use of derricks.               It will take 2  years  to provide these ships:                     Approximate capital cost  4,000,000, annual cost  8,800.    (c)  Additional skilled and unskilled  labour for dock working to be enlisted          and trained in peace, annual cost  25,000.^&apos;    (d) Fitting out of petrol ships in peace time, capital cost  15,000.    (e)  Provision of  extra equipment and reserves necessitated by the earlier          arrival of the Field Force into action, capital cost  12,000,000.    (/) Mobilization  stores  to accelerate preparation  of  the Force  in  this          country, capital cost  125,000.    The figures in this paragraph are  approximate  only  and  are subject to financial review.    Note.   The provision of the  ships  (paragraph  (&amp;)) will, as  stated,  take2 years.  Until these are completed the assembly of the Intermediate Contingentoverseas will take 24 days and the  full Field Force 36 days.    8.  It will  be  noted  that in no  circumstances can the Field Force arrive inthe 8 days proposed by M. Daladier. This is due to a large extent to the dangers of air attack which prevent the use of the Channel Ports in  the initial stages.    9.  I suggest  that the whole matter with alternative solutions be referred tothe Chief of Staffs Sub-Committee for an early  report.                                                                 L.
