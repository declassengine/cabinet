It  is  evident that  the  attitude of either partyduring the  discussions might lead us  to  the conelucion thatit would be wise to modify, in some way,  one or other  ofthese proposals.
                   5.     Dealing first with the constitutional issue                   we are in agreement with the Secretary of State                   in considering that neither the Jewish claim for the                   creation at some future date of a Jewish state                   covering the whole of Palestine nor the Arab claim                   that the country should become an Arab state can                   be admitted.   We should leave open the possibility,                   remote though it may be, that at some time in the                   future either the Arab or the Jewish population in                   Palestine may be ready to acquiesce in the creation                   of an independent state in which the other party                   predominates.Proposed Advisory  4.      We are  in agreement with  the Secretary of state council.    -___-w        for the Colonies  in considering  that the UnitedPossible Future    Kingdom Delegation should be  empowered to put forwardLegislativeCouncil.           the offer of an Advisory Council,  which would include,                   besides an official bloc,  Jewish and Arab representative                   in  equal  numbers,  and  that provision should be made  that                   if  a majority  of  the members  of  the  Advisory  Council,                   which  included a  majoritjr both of  the  Arab  and Jewish                   representatives passed  a resolution  asking  that  the                   Advisory  Council  should be superseded  by a Legislative                   Council on the basis of parity between the  two peoples,                   then such a Legislative Council  should be established-,                  We  recognise the  difficulty of persuading the Arab a                   to  agree  to the principle of parity but,  on the                   assumption that Jewish  immigration will be strictly                   ^irnited,  representations on a basis of population                  would condemn  the Jews  to a permanent minority
                position, and we agree with the Secretary of State                that this would &quot;be contrary to the spirit of the                Balfour Declaration,                5.      We suggest that in dealing with the                constitutional issue,  our rejection of  the Arab demand                for independence should be softened,  if possible,  by                some gesture of. special regard for Moslem religious                susceptibilities;  for example,  by an offer to                surrounding Moslem countries of the right to participate                by  means  of a body of  guards or otherwise, in the                protection of the Moslem Holy Places  in Jerusalem,   Such                a gesture would assure the Moslem delegates  of our                intention to safeguard their Holy Places against any                possibility of  Jewish  encroachment, and might be of                special value in winning the confidence of Egypt and                the neighbouring Arab  States.Governrrasnt.     6.      We are in agreement with  the proposal that  the                powers  of municipal bodies under the  Municipal Corporations                Ordinance  should be re-examined  and extended as far  as                possible  and that the  revenues  of the larger municipalities                should, if possible, be  increased, perhaps by allotting                to  them a portion of the  urban property tax collected in                their areas.Immigration.    7.      We have fully considered  the question of                Immigration  which we agree with  the Secretary of State for                the  Colonies is the most  crucial  of  the  questions to be                examined  at  the  London Conferences.   An agreed solution                of  this question  would,  if  it could be  reached,  go a very                long way  towards  settling the Palestine problem.
                                              2r80     We agree &quot;with the Secretary of State thatfor the reasons set out in paragraphs 42-4-7 of his memorandum, the demand of the Arabs for theimmediate and complete stoppage of Jewish immigration into Palestine cannot be entertained,.   We also agreethat there can be no permanent peaceful settlement in Palestine unless we can rid the Arabs of theirfears of Jewish domination, and that the time hascome to set definite limits to the expansion,without the consent of the Arabs, of the JewishNational Home09.     We recommend the Cabinet to adopt theSecretarjr of Sta.te!s suggestion that our represen-tatives should listen to the Arab and Jewish argumentsand by judicious soundings during the course of thediscussions form conclusions as to which of the two alternative proposals (A) and (B) on page 22 ofC .P. 4(39) should be suggested for adoption-10o    It will be seen that the fundamental difference between proposals (A) and (B) is that,whereas under (A) the question of further jewish immigration after the next ten years is left opo; for consideration, under (B), at the end of theten-year period, there would be no further jewish immigration without Arab consent,11.    We have been warned that scheme (B) islikely to meet with the strongest possibleopposition from the Jews, while the Arabs would regard scheme (A) as wholly unacceptable as providing no definite assurance as to the future
control of immigration0   It may well &quot;be that our representatives may come to the conclusion that no useful purpose would he served, by mentioning alterna-tive (A) to the Arabs,   Scheme (3) which will beopen to strong Jewish objections represents, inthe opinion of the Secretary of State, the maximumthat we are likely to persuade the Arabs to accept.Indeed as is pointed out in paragraph 54 of CP, 4(39)we may in certain circumstances have to makegreater concessions to the Arabs than is suggestedin Scheme (B)*18*    It must, we think, now be definitely accepted that, beyond a certain point, future Jewish immig-ration into Palestine must be dependent on the goodwill of the Arabs, and that wo must endeavourto convince the Jews that this is the casecIS.    dr Weizmann has recently informed theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the Jewswere not so much concerned about the actual numberof Jewish immigrants into Palestine, as aboutestablishing their claim that the Jewish peopleenter Palestine as of right and not on suffranceoAs pointed out in paragraph 14 of cp, 4- (39) theJewish claim in this respect is open to doubt,but however that may be, there is no doubt that theposition would be transformed if the Jewish leaderscould be persuaded to take a broad and generous viewof the whole problem and to make a unilateral declaration to the effect that they would in future
                  make  the  exercise  of  their  right contingent on                  Arab  consent.                  14c     While  it might be doubted whether the                  Jewish leaders  would  be prepared to  entertain                  such  a suggestion,  we recommend that the Secretary                  of State  for the Colonies should be  authorised to                  endeavour to persuade dr Weizmann to give                  favourable consideration to a  declaration on                  these  lines.,                  15.     We have been  warned by the Secretary of                  State  for India that  the Palestine problem is not                  merely an Arabian  problem but  is fast becoming                  a  Pan-Islamic problem and that if the London                  Conferences  fail to reach any  agreement or end                  in what is regarded as a substantial victory for                  the Jews,  serious  trouble in India must he                  apprehended.    In  this connection we would draw                  attention to paragraph 54 of Co?.. 4(59), from                  the concluding words  of which  it will be seen                  that  the  Secretary  of State for the Colonies*                  agrees  that  if any  widespread  hostility to us                  in the  Moslem world is really  involved, we                  cannot  afford such  a  result and we must                  yield  to  the deg.ree that may be necessary to                  avoid  it.   We are  in general  agreement with                  the views  expressed in this paragraph, but                  it will be noted that the Secretary of State for tho                  Colonies  does not press for any decision on                  the point  at the moment.

We recommend the Cabinet to approve the proposal in paragraph 74 III of CP, 4(59)that legislative steps should he taken to restrict the sale  of land by Arabs to Jews,UNITED KINGDOMREPRESENTATIONAT THE CONFERENCE.PROCEDURE,PUBLICITY ANDENTERTAINMENT.17.     We recommend that the United kingdom representatives at the Conference should be;       The Prime Minister,       The Secretary of State for         Foreign Affairs.

                                                          9 ft                APPENDIX.            COMMITTEE ON PALESTINE.           GO NEEEENCE S ON PALESTINE.     Procedure, Publicity and Entertainment^.      Memorandum by the Secretary of State                for the Colonies.1.   Hy colleagues may like to have a brief outline ofthe arrangements which. I contemplate as regards procedure,publicity and entertainment of delegates in connection withthe Conferences.2.   St. James&apos; Palace has been prepared for the use ofthe Conferences.   In addition to rooms for the use ofUnited Kingdom Ministers and the United Kingdom secretarialand clerical staff, the Picture Gallery has been, arranged forgeneral meetings and there will also be two large committeerooms which could be made available for the individual useof the Arab and Jewish delegations.   It may be that they willprefer  to conifer in their own hotels between meetings, butthere would, appear to be much to be said, from the psychologicalpoint of view, for getting them into the atmosphere of the palace by holding opening meetings very soon after their arr-ivaland, if posible, for getting each of the two delegations tomake some use of the Palace thereafter for their own meetings.                      PROCEDURE.3.   As regards a provisional time table, whilst we must,of course, be guided largely by the attitude of the delegationswhen they arrive in London, I think it would be useful tohave in our minds the sort of procedure which we should like to adopt if the atmosphere is favourable.   Inconvenient                      -1-
though it will be, we must adhere rather strictly at the outset, I think, to the understanding on which the delegations are visiting t .1s country, viz0,  that the grabsand Jews are each coming to confer separately with his majesty&apos;s Government.   It is for this reason that we have adopted the title &quot;Conferences on Palestine&quot;, and my present information indicates that any attempt to get the-Arabs and Jews to sit down together in one room at thebeginning would render the negotiations abortive.  If we make satisfactory progress in our discussions with thetwo sides separately, there is the hope that we shall, ata later stage, succeed in bringing them into tripartitenegotiation.4.  In these circumstances, my present feeling is that thebest course would be to have two separate opening meetings,preferably on the same day soon after the arrival of the delegates, one between United Kingdom Ministers and thewhole of. the drab delegations, and the other between UnitedKingdom Ministers and the Jewish delegation...   It would bea great advantage if the Prime Minister would consent to preside at these meetings and to welcome the delegates andto address them on general lines as to the desirability ofsome agreement between the parties concerned.   The leadersof the delegations might make very brief replies to thePrime Minister&apos;s speech, and the method of further procedure(which would have been agreed beforehand in informal discussions) would then be formally approved by the delegations.5.   After these opening meetings with the two sides weshould proceed, I hope, on the next day to meetings atwhich the delegations would  state their views and putforward their suggestions for an equitable solution ofthe problem..
o 160   Prom that the discussion with each side would proceed without intermission in whatever manner seems best.   Apartfrom the discussions between us and each of the other parties, we  should try to encourage informal meetings betweenJewish and Arab representatives.   Only when our soundingshave proceeded some way shall we be able to decide (a) whether there is any chance of turning the discussions into a formalconference of the three parties, and (b) whether and when we should produce our own proposals for a solution of theproblem.  &quot;7e should of course endeavour throughout to guide the discussions in the direction of our proposals.   &apos;7eshould keep a fairly firm guiding hand on the proceedings.                   PUBLICITY.7.   I propose the following arrangements regarding publicity for the proceedings of the Conferences:     (a) That a Minister should be in charge of publicityarrangements for the Conferences and should be assisted by a Principal Tress Officer.  (If my colleagues agree, Iwould be prepared to undertake this duty myself.)     (b) That the Press should be excluded from Conferencemeetings.     (c) That brief communiques should be issued at theconclusion of each meeting.     (d) That the Minister should give &quot;background talks&quot;to the Press at frequent but elastic intervals,.     (e) That the principal Press Officer, assisted bythe Departmental Press Officers, should be available to seethe Press, in the periods between the Minister?s back-ground talks, on such aspects of the proceedings as theMinister might think fit.
8-.   Mil 1st it iuay be a counsel of perfection to suggestthat trie individual Arab and Jewish delegates v/ill be ableto refrain from talking to the cress, we should endeavourto secure the formal concurrence of the delegations in these arrangements and, if possible, to associate there with theMinister in charge of publicity through a. Press AdvisoryCommittee or Committees representative of the delgatlons.;It would also be desirable, both on the eirrival of. theindividual delegates and at the opening meetings, to ask them to concur in a general undertaking to treat the officialdiscussions as confidential and to refrain from giving thePress controversial material during the Conferences0                 ENTERTAINMENT-9.   It is proposed that the delegates and their staffs should be the guests of His Majesty&apos;s Government whilstin London.  This offer has been made to, and accepted bythe delegations from the Arab gtates,   I understand alsothat it is likely to be accepted by the Jewish delegation.The offer will be made to the Palestinian delegation assoon as the composition of that delegation lias been settled.Arrangements are being made to accommodate the delegates at various hotels, and to extend to them the courtesiescustomary in the case of official guestsc10.  It may be that we shall find, when the delegationsarrive, that not only are they unwilling to . eet together for business purposes, but that they would also not beprepared to come together if they are in&quot; tied  to the same .official entertainment.   But we should be pim-p?&apos; -&apos;-fi to acrangan early general reception &quot;by His Majesty&apos;s Government atLancaster House for both the Arab and the Jewish delegations.In addition, we might prepare for two Government luncheons,one to all the Arab representatives and the other  to ail&quot;the Jewish representatives and for various private luncheon odinner parties to small numbers of the Palestinian. Arab  andthe Jewish delegations.
                           SUMMARY.          11.  . My proposals may be  summarised as follows:-                         PROCEDURE,               (a) Separate meetings with the Jews and ^arabs at the          outset.               (b) An opening meeting with each side in St. James&apos;          Palace as soon as possible aftev their arrival, comprising          a general address by the prime Minister and very brief replies          by the heads of delegations.               (c) Procedure after that to be settled in informal          talks with the Arabs and Jews on their arrival.                          PUBLICITY.               (d) A United Kingdom Minister to be responsible for          publicity, assisted by a principal Press Officer.               (e) If possible,  the  ^rab and Jewish delegations to          be associated with this arrangement through a Press .rvisory          Committee or Committees.               (f) The formal discussions to be confidential, but          brief agreed communiepicss and background talks by the          Minister or principal Press Officer to be given to the Press.                         ENTBRI-AINMMMT.               (g) Preparations to be made for a possible official          reception for both sides;   two separate official luncheons          for the Arab and Jewish sides, respectively;  and for small          luncheon or dinner parties for members of the Palestinian Arab          and Jewish delegations to be given by private individuals.
