TO  BE KEPT  UNDER  LOCK AND  KEY.

REPORT BY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.    1.  THE Committee of Imperial Defence, at its 343rd Meeting, held on the22nd  December, 1938,* requested  us to report in accordance with  the  following terms of reference :          &apos;&apos; That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should examine and report    by  the end of  January, 1939, on the possibility of shortening the  present    period necessary to bring the Navy, Army and Air Force on to a war footing.&quot;General Considerations.    2.  Before setting out our proposals, there are certain observations  of ageneral character which we wish to make.  We have thought it right, in additionto reviewing  the steps which could be taken to accelerate the mobilisation plans of the Navy, Army and Air Force, to consult the Planning Department of theOffice of the Lord Privy Seal with regard to any measures considered  necessaryfor accelerating the present procedure for calling out volunteer civil  personnel in an emergency.   We have therefore included at the end of our  report a  briefreference to this important aspect  of our readiness for war.    3.  The  rapidity with  which the fighting  services can be  placed  on a warfooting depends on two main factors.  In the first place, when an emergency isapprehended,  the  necessary  action to bring our forces from  their peace-timefooting to even semi-war strength can only be effected as a result of an order bythe Government of  the day, i.e., by a decision of the Cabinet.  We realise that a premature decision might well accentuate the political tension and precipitate a crisis.  On the other hand, it is to be remembered that the process of mobilisation,whatever improvements are made in mobilisation machinery, is a  long business.The mobilisation of the Navy, for example, cannot be completed in  less  than14 days; and a further period must elapse before ships can be worked up to fullefficiency. In these circumstances, it is of the utmost importance, in the  circum-stances of the present day, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should  give the orderto mobilise at the earliest possible moment in an emergency.    4.  In the second place, rapidity of mobilisation depends on the machinery which exists for calling up reserves in the respective Services.                       * C.I.D. 343rd Meeting, Minute 1 (c).       [186571                                                      B
    In the Navy and the Army,  this machinery is, in our opinion, out-of-date,because, with certain relatively unimportant exceptions, the calling-up of Armyand. Navy reserve personnel can only be effected by a Royal Proclamation.    In the September  crisis, the decision to mobilise the Navy was taken at alate stage and the procedure for  carrying it into effect was unsuited to  modernrequirements.   The same remarks apply,  mutatis mutandis,  to the mobilisation of the Army.    5.  The Royal Air  Force, on the other hand, is  hot faced  with the. same difficulties.  Air Force reserves can be called up by an  Order in Council andwe see no reason to  recommend any  alteration to this procedure.                                   NAVY..    6.  With the exception of pensioners, who can be called into actual service by the Admiralty in an emergency, the Various Naval Reserves can be called outonly by Royal Proclamation.    7.  The Admiralty have considered it essential to provide a reserve of men with previous service in the Royal Navy or Royal Marines, who can be called intoactual service in advance of  general mobilisation and so  enable certain units ofthe Fleet to be brought up to war complement, certain ancillary commitments tobe manned and  ships in  reserve to be brought to a  more advanced state of readiness,  without  prejudicing  general  mobilisation  by interfering with  the correct disposal of active service ratings.    8.  To meet this  requirement, the Admiralty are  forming a new Class ofthe Royal Fleet  Reserve,  called  &apos;&apos; Class  D, Immediate Reserve,&apos;&apos; composed ofmen with previous service in the Royal Navy or Royal Marines who undertaketo appear for service on being called put by the Admiralty in an emergency,  andthen  to enter upon  engagements to  serve in the Royal Navy or Royal Marinesfor a period not exceeding  three months.  While serving in  an emergency onthese temporary engagements ,they  will continue to belong to the  Royal FleetReserve and will become  mobilised  members of  that  Reserve if  and when theReserve is mobilised.    9.  The strength aimed  at for this new Class of the Royal Fleet Reserve is4,000. It will be open to Leading ratings and A. B. ratings  only of the Seaman,Signalman, Telegraphist,  Stoker, Steward and Cook branches and to Corporalsand Marines.  Men in the new Class will be required  to  perform fourteen days&apos;training in alternate years.  Men whose  civil employment might interfere withtheir continuous availability for immediate service will not be  accepted.    A considerable number of Pensioners must also be called up as a complementto the Immediate Reserve, as the higher ratings  (Petty officers, &amp;c.) are onlyfound amongst the  Pensioners.     Until the  response  to the formation of the  Immediate  Reserve  is seen, theAdmiralty do not propose  to put  forward new proposals for acceleration&apos; ofmobilisation.                                   ARMY.     10.   Measures to  place Army mobilisation on the  same footing as Air Forcemobilisation raise constitutional questions which would  require  far-reaching-legislative amendments.  We consider that this question should be examined by the War Office.   This will of course take time.  In the meanwhile we put forward in this  Report  the immediate  measures which  might  be  taken to accelerate mobilisation. Regular Army.     11.   The despatch of the Field Force to the Continent or elsewhere depends on various factors,  which are forming the subject of a  separate report.  Until acceleration of despatch is possible, it is not urgent to increase the present rate of mobilisation  of the Field Force. ;  In these circumstances the  War Office are concentrating  on measures for quickening up the deployment of Air Defence of Great Britain, the embodiment of the Territorial Army and  the organisation and calling up of National Defence companies.
    12.  In the event of air attack on  this country, the Regular  Army willmobilise at once.  The Intermediate Contingent of the Field Force will remain asa War Office  Reserve unless  despatched  to France, but the remainder of theRegular  Army will  be  available to assist  the  civil power.  There would  be considerable advantage,  however,  in being  able  to call  up for service, at homeSection &quot; A &quot;  Reservists (strength at present 5,269), so that certain units, at least,would be  up  to  establishment to assist   the  civil authorities.  At  presentSection &quot; A &quot;  can only be called up for service outside the United Kingdom, andan amendment to the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act is necessary to enablethe proposal to be carried out.Air Defence of Great Britain.    13.  As a result of the September crisis, the following steps have been taken with a view to ensuring  that deployment can be carried out within 12 hours.    (a) The amount of assistance to A.D.G.B. units by specialist regular           personnel has been increased.    (6) The programme  for completion of mobilisation stores is being accelerated.    (c) Gun sites are being bought or hired, and fixed mountings installed where           this can be done.    (d) Increase of  peace holdings of transport.    (e) Arrangements are being made for key parties to be called out before  the           precautionary stage.  This will appear in the  new draft of the Govern-           ment War Book.The Territorial Army, other than A.D.G.B.    14.  The Territorial Army (other  than A.D.G.B. formations) is required toassist the civil power from the very outset of the emergency. It is therefore essentialthat units should be at  their war stations  at the earliest possible moment.  Atpresent the embodiment of these  formations takes  at least four days.   This ismuch  too slow.    15.  The first essential, therefore,  is  that the whole of the Territorial army should be  placed on the same footing as the Anti-aircraft and Coast Defenceportion,  whereby it  would be called out for service in case of national emergencyon  the authority of the Secretary of  State for War,  subject of course to  theapproval of the  Cabinet.   This could be done by getting all serving personnel to sign an undertaking  similar  to that given by personnel of  A.D.G;B.  On theother  hand, it may  be considered  that  such  action is going behind the authorityof Parliament, and  it would also involve considerable administrative difficulties.It  is  suggested that it.  would be better  to amend  the  Territorial and reserve forces Act so that  the  Secretary of State  could call up the Territorial Armyby  Order in Council before the Regular Army Reserve  is called up.     16.   In addition, arrangements should be made under which the embodimentof  mobilisation  of  the  Territorial  Army  can be  accelerated.   This involvesarranging that certain processes are carried out in peace and that less importantparts of mobilisation are  relegated to  the period between  the  action  of  theTerritorial Army, to assist the civil authorities, and  its  concentration for furthertraining-.   In  this  connection   the  following  proposals  are   now  underconsideration:      (a) Key parties, similar in size and composition to those in A.D.G.B., will           be called out in advance of the remainder,  in order  to speed up  the           process of embodiment.  A special  code  telegram  has been included           in the list of code telegrams in the War Office War Book.     (&amp;) Medical  examination to  be  carried out in peace.  Inspection only  on           embodiment.    , (c) Certain Territorial Army establishments to be  raised to War establish-           ment  so that as  large  a  number  as possible will  be  immediately           available.     (d)  Documentation  to be speeded  up  by the Territorial Army soldier having           a booklet in  peace with documents required  on embodiment  enclosed.           This is being held up  solely by the unsatisfactory regulations now in           existence in  connection with  the  collection of unemployment and           insurance cards, and  the involved action which is necessary  in  the       [18657]                              .

           event, of men not bringing these with them on joining.  It is thought           that it will be possible to make satisfactory  arrangements with the           two  Ministries  concerned;  when this  is  done,  the  booklet  can be           produced within a fortnight.     (e) Key parties for embodiment to be trained.     (/) The provision of certain accommodation stores.  &apos;   17.  The raising of  Territorial Army Units to war  establishment  and provision of  more  storage accommodation  ((c)  and (/) above) will  involve considerable financial commitments; the remaining proposals will cost very little.National Defence Companies.     18.  In the event of emergency, these  companies will be required to  protectall  Service  vulnerable points (except Naval Dockyards and Service  Oil  Depotswhich coincide with or  adjoin - civilian  installations)  and certain  railwayvulnerable points and vital factories.  It is essential that they should be availablevery early in a crisis.  They are on the same footing as the units of A.D.GB,  and can be called up in the same way, but their organization requires improvement.     19.  At present the personnel  are organised in companies of varying sizes,affiliated to T.A. Infantry or ex-Infantry Units, in accordance with the tacticalrequirements of the locality in which they  are raised.  Companies are organisedinto groups commanded  by a National Defence  Companies&apos; Lieutenant-Colonelor Major, who is responsible to  the Area  Commander when National DefenceCompanies are called out for service.   -     The system is not at present satisfactory, due largely to the  fact that it isbeing conducted on a &quot; no cost &quot; basis.     Measures  for immediate improvement  include      (a) Arrangements for personnel to do 12 paid drills annually.     (b) Arrangements for  provision and  storage  of  necessary equipment  and          clothing.Supplementary Reserve.                                                    -    20.  The Supplementary Reserve, now  an integral part of the Regular army reserve, at present comprises       (a) Units *          RA.      )          R.E.        [ Total strength 8,200.          R.  Signals  )     (b) S.R.&quot; Not in Units.&quot;          Total strength of 22,000 mostly untrained as soldiers.     Supplementary Reserve Units will be most useful from the outset, and it willbe advisable to rail them  up early.     Further,  certain  Supplementary  Reserve  personnel, not  in Units, havetechnical qualifications that would  make them very valuable for addition to  anyRegular Units required for civil assistance in addition to the Territorial Army.     An amendment  to the Territorial and Reserve Force Act, 1907,  is requiredso that the Supplementary Reserve can be called out in an emergency.                            ROYAL AIR  FORCE.     21.  Under Section  5 (1) of the Auxiliary Air Force and Air Force ReserveAct,  1924,  His Majesty,  by an Order in  Council  declaring that  a state ofemergency&apos; exists, may order the Secretary  of State to give directions for calling out  the whole or part of the Auxiliary  Air Force  and Air Force  Reserve toserve in defence of the British Isles against actual or apprehended attack, whetheror not general mobilization has been ordered.     22.  The  Auxiliary  Air Force includes the  balloon barrage units.   the calling up  of  Air Force reservists  under  Section 5 (1) of the Act would enable                      *  Does not include 3rd A&apos;.A. Brigade, K.A.
the establishments of essential Royal Air Force units to be brought up to their war strength in advance of mobilization.  As compared with general mobilization,there is some delay in calling up personnel under Section 5 (1) because notices tojoin have to be sent to each individual reservist.    23.  If the Royal Air  Force is.to  be  in a position to deal with initial air attacks on this country, it is imperative that authority to call out the Auxiliarysquadrons and the Air Force Reserve for home  defence should be given at theearliest possible moment in emergency.  It is understood that arrangements havebeen made to include this item among the  first which will be brought before theCabinet, or before a conference of Ministers, by the  Standing. Sub-Committeeon the Co-ordination of Departmental  Action in a  threatened emergency.  TheAir Staff are satisfied, provided a sufficiently early  decision  can be given by theGovernment, that, in general, the existing powers under the Auxiliary Air Forceand Air Force Reserve Act are sufficient.    24.   The efficiency of the defensive arrangements  against air attack is dependent on the putting  into operation of the Air Defence Intelligence Scheme.This  Scheme is designed  to provide the officer responsible for air defence with information about the movements of enemy aircraft.   The&apos; Observer Corps, whichis made up of special constables,  is an essential part  of the organization, andit is equally important, therefore, that very early  authority should be given, if air attack on this country is apprehended, for initiating the Air Defence IntelligenceScheme, involving the calling out of the  Observer  Corps.Civil Defence Personnel.    25.   We are informed  that the existing machinery for calling out civilvolunteer personnel  in  an emergency in connection with  Air Raid Precautionservices can be regarded as satisfactory.  We attach great importance to ensuring that our civil defence services are put  on a war footing step by step with ouractive air defence. Active and passive air defence measures are, in fact, mutuallycomplementary.Summary of Conclusions  and Recommendations.    26.   To sum up :      (1) The rapidity of  the process  of  mobilisation depends chiefly on the           efficiency of the machinery  for calling up reserves.   We recommend           that the War  Office should consider what legislative measures would           be required to bring the Army on to  the same footing in this matter           as the Royal Air Force.     (2)  The immediate  steps which  we recommend may  be  summarised  as           follows :            Royal Navy.               No immediate steps are required, provided  the response to the           new &quot; immediate reserve&quot; is satisfactory (paragraphs 8 and 9).           Army.               (a) Legislation to enable Section  &quot; A &quot; of the Army reserve to be                     used   in  the  United  Kingdom prior  to  mobilisation                      (paragraph 12).               (6) Legislation to enable the Territorial Army to be called up by                      Order in Council before the regular Army reserve is called                     up  (paragraph 15).               (c) Steps  to speed up the process of embodiment of the Territorial                      Army :  .                       (i) by having trained &apos;&apos; key parties &apos;&apos;;                       (ii) by Medical  Examination in peace;                      (iii) by raising certain  territorial army establishments to                            war establishment;                      (iv)  by improving  the system  of  documentation  (para-                            graph  16).               (d) Certain measures for paid  drills, equipment,  &amp;c, for the                      National Defence Companies (paragraph 19).
        -  (e)  An  amendment to the Territorial and  Reserve Force Act,                1907, to enable the Supplementary Reserve to be called out                in an emergency (paragraph 20).                      :      Royal Air Force.          No immediate steps required.  Present powers are satisfactory      (paragraphs 21-24).      Civil Defence Personnel.          No immediate steps required.  Present powers are satisfactory      (paragraph 25).(3) While the steps summarised above will ensure a considerable measure of      acceleration, the time required to complete mobilisation cannot by any      means  be reduced below  a  certain minimum.   Hence, we  must      emphasise the paramount  importance of a timely decision  by the      Government to authorise executive action.  This remains the founda-      tion-stone of our defensive preparations (paragraphs 3, 23 and 24).                              (Signed)       C. L. N.

(OLD.  Paper No. 1526-B.)    (Previous reference :  OLD. Minutes of the 343rd Meeting, Minute (1).)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee on Acceleration of Mobilisation (OLD. Paper No. 1526-B).    SIR CYRIL NEWALL,  introducing the Report, said that the  Chiefs ofStaff had been asked to report on the possibility of shortening the period necessaryfor mobilisation.   Their conclusions were  set out in paragraph 26.   The royal navy were  introducing a  new class  of reserve  called &quot; Class  D,  ImmediateReserve,&quot; the objects of which were set out in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Report.Provided  the response for  this  reserve was satisfactory  the Admiralty were satisfied with their present powers.  Most of the measures recommended  in theReport related to  the Army; the most important of these  was the  proposal inparagraph 15, which would enable the whole of the Territorial Army to be called out before general mobilisation was ordered.  The Royal Air Force were satisfied with their existing procedure.  The Auxiliary Air Force and the Reserve couldbe called out on the signature of the Secretary of State for Air.    SIR THOMAS INSKIP, referring to paragraph 4, asked why mobilisationcould be  effected more  quickly  by  an  Order-in-Council than by  a  RoyalProclamation.    LORD STANHOPE said that he did  not think there was much difference in point of time.  The issue of a Royal Proclamation necessitated a meeting of the privy Council; but this could not always be summoned at very short notice. TheAdmiralty had come to the  conclusion that there was not much to be gained by substituting an Order-in-Council  for  a  Royal Proclamation. .    SIR CYRIL NEWALL said that a Royal  Proclamation created much moredisturbance  of mind  than an Order-in-Council;  under the latter men were called up by individual letter, and this caused little publicity.    MR. HORE-BELISHA said that in his view the best method to adopt in thecase of the Territorial Army would be to put them all on the same footing as the units of A.D.G.B.  The men of these units signed an undertaking to come out for service whenever called upon to da so by the authority of the Secretary of State forWar.  He thought it would be quite easy  to obtain  a similar signature from therest of the Territorial Army without the  necessity for any legislation.  It was important to obtain the services of the Territorial Army very early to assist thecivil authorities.     SIR SAMUEL HOARE agreed with  the views of the Secretary of State forWar.  The  less discussion of the matter that there was in Parliament, the better.       [18685]
     MR. MORRISON drew attention to paragraph 15 of the Report and said hethought that the procedure  suggested by the Secretary of State for War mightraise objections in Parliament on the grounds that it would be going behind their authority.     MR. HORE-BELISHA thought that, in the present spirit of the country, his proposal would go through without comment.   In the crisis the rest  of  theTerritorial Army clamoured to go out, and, in fact, many men presented them-selves at the drill halls.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD agreed with this view.     MR. HORE-BELISHA, continuing, drew attention to paragraph 12 of theReport, which suggested an alteration in the terms of Service of Section A of theReserve to enable them to be called out for service in this country.  He himself would prefer that this alteration should apply to all classes of the Reserve and notonly to Section A.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD asked whether  legislation would be essential.Could not the reservists be asked to sign an undertaking like the  TerritorialArmy?     SIR RONALD ADAM said that under the Army  Act it was  specificallystated that Section A of the Reserve could be called out only for &apos;&apos; warlike services overseas.&quot;  He thought an alteration of the Act would be essential.  It could bedone when the Army Act came up for annual review.     SIR EDWARD BRIDGES said that the various proposals that had emerged from the discussion would make  a radical  change in the whole conception  ofmobilisation.  Their effect would be that the forces would be mobilised in advanceof the formal process as hitherto understood.  Such a change might be necessary under modern conditions, but the Committee should be in no doubt as to the effectof their decision in this matter.     SIR JOHN SIMON thought that the mood of the country was favourableat the present time to measures of this kind, but suggested that there might beopposition in Parliament on the grounds that advantage might be taken of thenew arrangements to call up  reservists to deal with civil disturbances, strikes, &amp;c,without the  authority of Parliament.  He thought  the Committee of ImperialDefence would be prepared, if the Secretary of State for War considered it vital,to support the change; but it would be for the Cabinet to decide the matter.     MR.  HORE-BELISHA agreed that  the calling out of  the  Army Reservesraised more difficult issues than the calling out of the Territorial Army.   Hewould like to consider it further, and put proposals before the Cabinet.     SIR JOHN  SIMON said that the  proposals contained  in  paragraph  26(2) (c) and (d) were comparatively minor matters, but  he thought they should onlybe  approved  subject  to detailed examination  as to  their  importance  inaccelerating mobilisation.  For example, he noticed that it was now proposedthat the  National Defence  Companies, who  up to the present had been on a&quot;no cost&quot; basis, were now to have twelve paid drills annually.  This introduced a new idea which might lead to expanded proposals and he would like to examineit further.     SIR RICHARD HOPKINS suggested that the proposals might be examined by the Treasury Inter-Service Committee.     MR.  HORE-BELISHA  agreed.  He  explained  that the  National DefenceCompanies had a specific duty, that of guarding vulnerable  points.  At presentthey had no status, no badge, and in fact were not a coherent body.  The proposalsnow put  forward would rectify this state  of affairs.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD had nothing to add  to the Report as far as itconcerned the Royal Air Force.     SIR JOHN  ANDERSON  said he was satisfied on the question of  calling out civil defence personnel.  The Committee would realise that he was concernedwith the speed at which the armed forces could be mobilised, as the assistanceof the Army would be vital in Home Defence measures.
CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed :  (a)  To take  note that  subject  to  a  satisfactory  response to  the new      &quot;immediate reserve&quot; no  steps are at present required to accelerate      the process of mobilisation of the Royal Navy.(b)  To take note, with reference to paragraphs 10, 12 and 20 of the Report,      that the. Secretary of State for War proposed to consider the whole      question of the procedure for calling out Army Reserves and to submit      proposals to the Cabinet.(c)  To recommend that the personnel of all units of the Territorial Army      (other than units of A.D.G.B.  and  Coast  Defence)  should now be      invited to undertake an obligation to come up for service in emergency      when required  by the Secretary of State for War.  The effect of this      would be that  the whole of the Territorial Army would be on the      same footing in this matter.(d)  To approve,  subject to detailed examination by  the Treasury  Inter-      Service Committee, those  measures  for the acceleration of the process      of embodiment of the Territorial Army, and for improving the status      of the National Defence  Companies, which are summarised in para-      graph 26  (2) (c) and id)  of the Report, namely :      &quot;(2)    *           *          *  .        *          *          *       (c) Steps to speed up  the process  of embodiment of  the  Territorial             Army.             (i) by having trained &quot;key parties&quot;;             (ii) by Medical Examination in peace;           (iii) by raising certain territorial army establishments to war                   establishment;            (iv) by improving the system of documentation (paragraph 16).       (d)  Certain measures for paid drills, equipment, &amp;c, for the National             Defence Companies (paragraph 19).&quot;     ****** (e) To take note that the present procedure for the mobilisation of the Royal       Air Force is satisfactory and that no measures of acceleration are at       present required. (/) To take note that the present procedure for calling out civil defence       personnel is satisfactory and that no measures of acceleration are at       present required. (g) To invite the attention of the Cabinet to the views of the Chiefs of Staff       as expressed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 26 (3) of their Report, on the       importance of a timely decision  by the  Government to authorise       executive action in an emergency. (h) That  the  Report of the Chiefs  of  Staff (C.I.D. Paper No. 1526-B),       together with the above Minutes of the discussion, should be submitted       to the Cabinet.     ******Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,   February 16, 1939.
