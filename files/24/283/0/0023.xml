INTRODUCTION.    THE Cabinet  at  a  meeting held on the 7th November, 1938,* had  underconsideration the subject of Defence Programmes and Acceleration and recorded,.inter alia, the following conclusions :                             C. AIR PROGRAMME.    &quot; C. (i) That approval should be given in principle to the full programme          of 3,700 additional Fighters and authority for the placing of orders-          as necessary for one half thereof.         * -         *         *                     ,*          *               [In terms of first-line fighter strength the above conclusion gives          authority for  the provision of 50 squadrons a total  of 800 fighters.]                        B. WAR  OFFICE PROGRAMME.    &quot; Anti-aircraft equipments     B. (i) That the number of  anti-aircraft equipments at present authorised          should be increased  to  the number specified in the &quot;Ideal Scheme&quot;          for the Air Defence  of Great Britain, and such additional numbers          as might be agreed are required  for ports abroad.               [Agreement has  been reached that this represents  a provision of          686 static 3-7-in. equipments.]   (ii) That the War  Office should be authorised to create the capacity required          for carrying out the increased programme,  and to place immediate-          orders for  additional  equipments in  so  far as  such orders were          essential to the development of  new capacity to  reach the stage of          production and delivery.  Treasury approval for the proposals should          be obtained in the ordinary way.    Light anti-aircraft equipments    (iii) To take note that the question of the possibility of obtaining from any          source,  British  or foreign,  deliveries of 1,000  light  anti-aircraft          equipments  of any type is still under examination by the War Office.    Searchlights    (iv) That the  War Office  should be authorised to  place orders  for such          additional,searchlights as are required up to a total of 600 (including          approximately  50  which  may   be   required  at  ports  abroad           x     x      x)  on the understanding that before such orders  are          placed detailed arrangements are made with the  Treasury.         *           *   ,       *           *           i*&apos;          *   Review of Home Defence arrangements     (x) That  the Minister for  Co-ordination of Defence, in the light of  the-          decisions  recorded in  these   Conclusions,   should  arrange   for  a          comprehensive review to  be undertaken of  Home  Defence arrange-          ments, with a view to determining what readjustments are necessary          in order  to secure a proper balance.&quot;118616]* Cabinet 53 (38), Conclusion 2.
    2.  This memorandum is forwarded in compliance with Conclusion (x) above.    In Part I the Home  Defence Committee have set  out the measures which,in their view, should be approved at once.  Part II  deals with the question of possible future expansion whidh  has been placed before them  in the course ofthe last fortnight by the War Office.    The question has been referred to the A.D.G-.B. Sub-Committee for detailed examination, and will form  the subject of a further  Report in due course.    3.  For convenience  of  reference  the  following is a  list of the  present approved numbers  of  fighters,   guns,  lights and balloons  (exclusive of  war reserves):     Fighter Aircraft          50 squadrons  (16 a/c initial equipment), i.e., a  total of 800  Fighters.*    A.A. Guns          976 3-7-inch.         288 4-5-inch, i.e., a total of 1,264 A.A. Guns.*    Light A .A. Guns          1,112 barrels, t         [Owing  to technical developments, the War  Office were  subsequently    able to reduce this  total  to 998 barrels.  Treasury approval has been obtained    for this latter number  in terms of 846 single and 76 twin equipments a    total of 922 equipments.]    Balloons          1,455 Balloons, t    Searchlights          172 Companies (24  lights), i.e., a total of 4,128 lights.:):     The War Office, have authority to place orders  for  additional  lights,  if required, up to a total of 600. g* Cabinet 53 (38), Conclusion 2, and CP. 218 (38).f C.I.D. 331st Meeting, Conclusion 13, and C.I.D.

PART  I.                         AIR MINISTRY PROGRAMME.Fighter Force.     4.  As noted under conclusion C  (i) quoted above, authority has been givenfor the provision of 50 squadrons (800  fighters).  This total would include 4 field force  Squadrons and,  while the fighter defence is based, on  a  disposition of46 squadrons, the 4 Field Squadrons are normally deployed in the line in such a manner that their withdrawal can be  effected when required by the Field Forcewithout disorganisation.  The layout is shown in Appendix A.     5.  To meet the case of the heaviest scale of attack being directed against any-one  of  the four  principal areas it has been necessary to provide a sufficientlyelastic ground organisation to permit of reinforcement by squadrons from one area to another.   In  consequence, new Sector  Stations in  the Eastern  counties(Swantoh Morley) and in  the  West  and an  organised  satellite aerodrome atGullane in the North have been introduced and the fullest use will be  made ofsatellite aerodromes.  The reorganisation of Sectors incidental  to these  require-ments is shown on the Map attached as Appendix B.     6.  No increases  to the Fighter Force are at present considered necessary.R.D.F.     7.  Within the present approved programme 18 R.D.F. chain stations will becompleted  by about  the 1st April, 1939.  This organisation  provides R.D.F.observation between Dundee and the Isle of Wight.   The Air Ministry  are now taking immediate steps to  obtain sanction for the provision of full-scale R.D.F.stations at Kirkwall and Stonehaven (for Scapa Flow), and  on a reduced scale atPrawle Point and Exmoor.  The layout, as it will then be,  is shown on the Mapattached as Appendix C.     It  is  anticipated, that any further  extension of  the chain, if  later foundnecessary, would be a relatively small commitment.Balloon Barrage.     8.  No alterations or additions are at present contemplated to the equipment or layout of the approved* Balloon Barrage in its present state of development.A map  showing the layout  of the barrages is attached as Appendix G.                         WAR OFFICE  PROGRAMME.Illuminated Zone.    9.  The Committee of  Imperial Defence, at  their  meeting held on  the23rd June,  1938,t approved the proposals of the  A.D.G.B. Sub-Committee  (seeC.I.D. Paper No.  288-A) for a perimeter defence to cover all important industrial areas.  This  lighted  zone  is shown in  the  map attached  as  Appendix  B.The Sub-Committee exressed the view that this represented finality in what could usefully be done as regards illumination.    10.   The Home Defence Committee adhere to this view in so far as the areas to  be illuminated are  concerned.   New factors, such  as the development  ofR.D.F.  (searchlight  control) and the production  of the more efficient 150  cm.searchlight suggest, however, the desirability of certain changes in equipment.The 150 cm. Searchlight and R.D.F. (searchlight control).    11.   The 150 cm.  searchlight  is a  considerably more powerful illuminantthan the 90 cm.  type, and  its introduction into the defences  would materiallystrengthen the position.  R.D.F. (searchlight control), which is described in para&quot;-graph 26, et seq., gives promise of being a highly important asset  towards  thesolution of ensuring the initial pick-up of the target.  It is therefore important                     * C.I.D. 331st Meeting, Conclusion  13.                     t C.T.D. 327th Meeting, Minute 5.
 that both those developments should be introduced  into the defences as soon as- possible on a scale which would represent the best compromise between  increased efficiency  of  the defences, on the one  hand,  and considerations of production, economy, time, on the other.     12.  It is thought that the replacement of one 90 cm.  searchlight  by one- 150 cm. searchlight plus R.D.F. in  each section of  lights (6  lights) would meet these  requirements.  Allowing for  10 per cent,  war  reserve,  this represents. 756 150 cm. lights.  There are 200 150 cm. lights included in the present provision. It is therefore recommended that an additional 556  should be ordered forthwith.. The recommendations as regards R.D.F. (Searchlight Control) are  dealt with in paragraph 28.     13.  The introduction of  150 cm.  lights into the  zone on  the scale recbm- mended above would release a number of 90 cm. lights equivalent to  22 companies. It might be thought that production of the 90  cm.  searchlight could be reduced to a corresponding extent, i.e., 556 lights, but the Home Defence Committee are- informed that, owing to the advanced stage of the 90 cm. searchlight production programme, it is too late to stop production on the 90 cm. lights which  will be replaced.   Apart from this, however,  the  Committee feel  that  it will  be  a considerable  advantage  to have these  extra lights  available for the  following reasons.     14.  In the first place  it will be recalled that a spacing of 6,000 yds. (instead of the original 3,000  yds.)  between lights has been accepted for the illuminated zone.  While  this spacing is adequate for  co-operation with aircraft, a closer interval between lights  may prove to be desirable in the case of guns in order to ensure that there is sufficient illumination  for the  gun instruments to operate at full efficiency.  It is possible that methods for engaging the invisible target may eventually obviate  the necessity for employing searchlights with A.A. guns, but if these hopes are not fulfilled, it may be necessary to  thicken up the searchlights in those portions of the illuminated areas which  contain gun zones.    In the second place it is highly probable that any searchlights, surplus to the requirements  of the  Air  Defence scheme,  will readily be absorbed  by other demands, e.g., ports abroad, or by foreign customers.    15.  In view of  the large  demands in man power  necessary to  meet the requirements  of the  increased  AA. gun defences  described later, the HomeDefence Committee do not recommend the immediate formation of any additional searchlight units.  They desire, however, to draw attention to the possibility that additional units for searchlight co-operation with guns may prove necessary when the position has been reviewed in  the light of developments  in  R.D.F.  (guncontrol). General Considerations  governing A.A.  Gun Defence.    16.  At  their  294th Meeting on the 17th June,  1937,  the Committee of Imperial Defence endorsed the  view of the Home Defence Committee that the &quot; Ideal &quot;  Scheme (1,264 guns) was by  no means an over-insurance.  Since that date the problem of the air defence of this country has become much more acute for the following reasons :       (i) There has been an increase both in the possible scale and weight of          attack.  For example, the &quot; Ideal &quot;  Scheme was based on a German          First Line strength of 1,700 bombers, but  the number which they could          now  deploy is considerably  greater.  Moreover, bomb loads are now          greater than when the &quot; Ideal &quot; Scheme was prepared.     (ii) There  are now increased  commitments requiring  defence,  e.g.,  the          higher  performance  of bombers  has increased the possible scale of          attack on places which previously, by virtue of range from continental          air  bases,  were only liable to a  light scale of attack;  expansion of          industry has increased the importance of some areas and created new          vulnerable points in others.    (iii) There is the need for a portion of the gun defences to be mobile.  These-          guns will be initially disposed in action  in accordance with  the  plan          of  the Air  Officer  Command ing-in-Chief, but  available for  moves.          elsewhere at short notice.
   (iv) A  more  widespread  realisation  of  the possibilities of  air  attack  has           increased the importance of the moral factor.   This points to the           necessity for providing defence on  a scale which will guard against           the   possibility  of  the  demoralization  of  the  civil   population,           particularly of   those  employed  in  industry,  to  the  extent  of           interrupting essential production.    There is this further difference in the position.  In the atmospheric conditions prevailing over  this country, attacking aircraft may be invisible both  from theground and the air.  Hitherto,  such aircraft have been immune from attack bythe defences.  Recent developments in the control of  A.A. gun fire have already made it possible to engage the invisible target in a reasonably satisfactory manner.R.D.F.  (Gun control),  described in paragraphs 26 and 27 is likely to produce amuch more accurate solution to  the problem. The value of the A.A.  gun is thusconsiderably enhanced.    All the above factors  lead  the Home Defence Committee to the conviction that the number of guns recommended in the &quot; Ideal &quot; Scheme (1,264 guns), farfrom being an over insurance, no longer represents even adequate insurance.   /A .A.  Guns.     17.   In November 1938 the Cabinet  gave approval*  for  an  increase of3-7-inch guns up to the total specified in the &quot; Ideal&quot; Scheme.  Agreement hasbeen  reached that, with war reserves and equipments  for certain ports abroad,this represents a provision of a  further 686  equipments, and that these  should bestatic 3 - 7-inch equipment.     18.   The effect of this increase would  be  to bring the total number of newfuns (3-7-inch  and 4-5-inch) available for action in A.D.G.B. up to 1,264, the  gure  recommended in the  &quot; Ideal  Scheme.&quot;   There are,  in addition, the320 3-inch guns which are included in  the defences at present approved.  Theseguns, though less suitable for the defence of large  areas of major importance, arevaluable for the defence of - objectives not covered by the &quot; Ideal &quot; Scheme, suchas  aerodromes, t  and for  forming the  mobile element  referred  to  in para-graph  16 (iii).  The Home  Defence Committee recommend, therefore, that the320 3-inch guns should be retained as an integral part of the defences.     19.  The effect of retaining these 3-inch guns, together with the additionalnew guns mentioned in paragraph 17, will be  to entail the formation of 78 newbatteries.     20.  It was mentioned  in  paragraph 17  that Cabinet  approval applied  tostatic equipments.  From  an operational standpoint, increases  in terms  of thestatic 3-7-inch  gun are generally acceptable, provided that an adequate scale  ofmobile equipments is also maintained.  At present it is contemplated that therewill eventually be 352 mobile 3 - 7-inch guns in the defences, but, with a view to-expediting production, 108 of these have been accepted on semi-static mountings,with the  proviso that at a later date these should  be  converted to mobile guns, ifnecessary.     21.  The Home Defence Committee are satisfied that  this conversion willin fact be necessary, apart from operational requirements, for  training purposes.They therefore recommend  that the  conversion  of  the 108  semi-static  equip-ments should be undertaken as soon as this is convenient from the point of view ofproduction.     22.  The proposed allocation of the 78 new  batteries (see paragraph 19) isshown  in Appendix &quot; D,&quot; in which, for convenience,  the following gun strengthsare compared in detail:                                                                Guns.

The addition of 78 batteries to (B) above     ...    1,584     To the above figures should be added 7  per cent, for reserves.   :              *  See Conclusion B (i). quoted in paragraph 1.                 f For list of aerodromes requiring defence, see Appendix &quot;F.&quot;
A. A. Gun Ammunition.     23.   The quantities of A.A. gun ammunition required are dependent on thescale  of attack  and  the  allocation  of  the  ammunition  to  the  variousechelons. The increased scale of attack would appear to require a corresponding increase in  the scale of ammunition in terms of rounds per gun.  It is  pointedout, however, that the rear echelons of ammunition hold the bulk of the totalquota, and the greater part of the ammunition is, therefore, so to speak, a mobilereserve, which can be applied as required.  As ammunition is allocated on a basisof rounds per gun, the increased number of guns will result in a very appreciableincrease in the total reserve of ammunition.     For  this reason, despite the increased  scale of attack, the Home DefenceCommittee consider that a reduced scale of  ammunition in terms of  rounds pergun is acceptable.   The scale recommended is 3,000 rounds per gun in the London,Thames and Medway area and 2,000 rounds  elsewhere.     24.   The effect  of this would be a net  increase of 1,248,000 rounds arrived at-as follows :      Present scale          London Area 112 guns at 4,000 r.p.g.         Elsewhere    240   ,,  ,, 2,500 r.p.g     Proposed scale          London Area 344 guns at 3,000 r.p.g.         Elsewhere    632      ,, 2,000 r.p.g                       Net increase   ............  1,248,000    25.  The above arguments do not apply to the 4-5 gun since the number ofequipments is not being increased.   No change is therefore recommended in theexisting scale of ammunition for that gun.R.D.F. (Gun and Searchlight control).    26.  R.D.F. as a means of directing gun fire and for work with searchlightsis in a sufficiently advanced stage to make it a highly important development inthe defences.   At its present stage,  R.D.F. gives promise of being a very accuraterangefinder and of being capable of indicating line within one degree.  At a later stage it appears likely that the present errors in line can be materially reduced andthat/accurate measurement of elevation can be ensured.   Even as it stands it is.an invaluable aid towards reducing the time required to prepare fire data.    27.  In its later development R.D.F. may well prove  a complete answer to thevery important problem of engaging the invisible target by guns.  Further, whilealready of great assistance  to the  searchlight for  co-operation with aircraft, itshould eventually be able  to provide complete data to enable the light to open onthe target.    28.  It is recommended that R.D.F.  (gun control) sets should be provided foreach gun station and R.D.F. (searchlight control)  sets on a scale of one per sectionof searchlights (6 lights).  On this basis the requirements are approximately :         For gun stations   ...     ...    ...     ...     ...    ...     480         For searchlights   ...     ...    ...     ...    ...    ...     688         10  per cent, of war reserves   ...     ...     ...    ...     116                 Total    ..................   1,284    The provision of 500 sets has already been sanctioned, and the Home DefenceCommittee strongly recommend that the completion of R.D.F. (gun and search-light control)  to the above scale  should  be pressed forward  as fast as possible,i.e., that a further 784 sets should be provided.  At a later stage experience may show that a higher scale of provision of R.D.F. is necessary for searchlight control.Light A.A. Guns.    29.  The  broad principle of defence against low-flying  attack is that areascontaining many vital points  are to be  defended by balloon barrages, and that defence by Light A.A. Artillery is to be confined to isolated vital points.448,000 1 104Q000600,000  M&apos;U4B.UUU   ...   1,032,000  i O296 000.   ...   1,264,000 jA^yO-uuu
    30.  At  their 331st Meeting, held on the 27th July, 1938,  the  Committeeof Imperial Defence approved the recommendations of the Home Defence Com-mittee (Paper No. C.I.D. 291-A) for  the provision of  balloon and Light A.A::gun defences.  The number of Light A.A. barrels  recommended  was 1,112.    Owing to technical developments in fire control the War Office were sub-sequently enabled to reduce this requirement to 998 barrels.  Treasury approvalwas obtained for this reduced number.    31.  : The above-mentioned  recommendation for light A.A. defences was inrespect of the protection of about 167 vital points.  This included a margin of20 points for  unascertained requirements.   Since that date  certain  furtherrequirements have been revealed, which, although  not yet scrutinized in detail by the A.D.G.B. Sub-Committee, may be taken as reasonably firm.    These are  as follows :      (i)  Royal  Ordnance and I.C.I. Factories ...    ...     ......    11    (ii)  Further aerodromes and  aircraft-storage units arising out of           the Royal Air Force expansion (including Fleet  Air Arm    32.  Further applications for the defence, for example, of railway junctionsand other vital points are almost certain to be submitted, and it is inevitable thatthe margin of 20 (see paragraph 31 above) will prove inadequate.    All  such applications should be referred to the A.D.G.B. Sub-Committee-for detailed  examination and  &apos;&apos; pruning,&apos;&apos;  but  pending  the result  of  this examination, the Home Defence Committee feel  that provision ought to be madefor expansion of the defences beyond the limits contemplated in July 1938.  they recommend, in this respect, provision for an additional 40 points, over and abovethe 63 mentioned  in the preceding paragraph,  making a total of 270  in all.Judging by experience of reconnaissances in connection with defences  alreadyauthorized, it appears probable that a further increase of 700 equipments will berequired for  these new defences.  The  Home  Defence Committee accordingly recommend the  addition of 700 40 mm. equipments to those already sanctioned(922), the units to be formed as  soon as  training facilities and the productionsituation permit.  Some of these additional guns will have to be mobile,  butpending  detailed reconnaissance,  the Home Defence  Committee are unable torecommend the precise proportion  that should be on this basis.Organisation.    33.  The above recommended increases in the defences, if approved, wouldinvolve the formation within the next twelve months of some 22 A.A. Artilleryregiments and 25 Light A.A. Artillery Regiments.  It will therefore be essentialto have  a corresponding increase  in the  higher  formations, brigades  (formerlygroups),  Divisions, &amp;c.  The War Office is of the opinion that the defences shouldbe organised into  two corps with a total of seven divisions, as opposed to thepresent organisation of one corps of five  divisions.  As planning  must start atany early date, the War Office further recommend very strongly that the higherorganisation should  be sanctioned forthwith, in  order to avoid  that delay which inevitably arises if the higher organisation is not in being at the outset of anyexpansion.    34.  The Air  Officer Commanding-in-Chief  has represented that it has been-of great  advantage to deal with a single commander.  The  War Office, however,consider  that for the moment the formation of  two corps does  not call  for any higher organisation to co-ordinate them, and that the instructions of the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief as regards the operation of the A.A.  Defences  can  becarried out as at present through the Commander-in-Chief, 1st A.A. Corps.    35.  Of the additional 78  3-7-in.  batteries  about half  should be fully equipped by the middle of 1940,  the  remainder by the end of that year.  It isressential to  form  the new units, as soon  as training  facilities  can be  made-       requirements)(iii) R.D.F. stations3121Total63[18616]c
available.  The War Office have accordingly examined this aspect of the problem and wish to form up to 42 batteries on or about the 1st April,  1939, and theremainder on or about the 1st November, 1939.  As regards these latter batteriesthe War  Office further wish to examine the possibility of. forming a portion ofthem on a regular basis.Man Power.     36.*   The requirements in personnel  for the new  Proposals plus reliefsamount to about 40,000 officers and other  ranks.  In view of  the experience of recruiting in the present A.A. organization and of the increased interest in air defence now being evinced throughout the country, the War Office consider thatthe difficulties involved in raising this large number of men can be overcome.Cost.    37.  The approximate cost of the various increases in the A.A. Defences isas follows (it has not yet been possible to have these figures scrutinised in detail by the Finance  Branches of the War Office) : (Addition of 78 A.A. batteries, R.D.F. throughout the defences and additions in         light A.A. guns to a total of 1,698 equipments).          &apos;                                                     &apos;  - : -         (a) 556-150 cm..

Northern Ireland.    38.  It  should be  noted that no  defences have been included for Northern Ireland.  Belfast  has  recently assumed increased  importance,  both as  regards shipbuilding and aircraft  production.   Although Northern Ireland  receives considerable security by virtue of its  position to the  Westward  of the general defence  system, it  is within  bombing range.  If the  Committee  of Imperial Defence consider that provision of local Defence for Northern Ireland is desirable in principle, the  Home Defence Committee will arrange for the matter to be examined in detail.    *  NOTE. The Home Defence Committee in their Memorandum on &quot;Ideal&quot;  Air Defence (see C.I.D. Paper No. 255-A, paragraph 27) pointed out that the implementation of the &quot;Ideal &quot; Scheme would create  formidable man-power difficulties which  it might not  be possible to overcome without some form of compulsory service.
                       SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.    39.  The recommendations may be summarised as follows:                                 Air Ministry.

The           provision for  searchlights to  be reviewed  in  the  light of further-           experience (paragraph 28).    (vii) Light A.A.  Guns.               An increase of  700 Light A.A. equipments additional to the 922&apos;           already authorised,  the units for  which to be formed  as soon as  a           training scale of equipment can be provided.  Included  in  these           increases should  be a  number  of mobile batteries (paragraph 32)-    (viii)  Higher Organisation.               The War Office recommend that the present organisation of one-           A.A. Corps of five divisions  should be expanded to  two corps with  a           total of seven divisions.   The hew organisation to be sanctioned  as           from the 1st April, 1939, with  a view to ensuring  the  necessary           planning to enable it to absorb the new units and take  Over existing           ones smoothly (paragraph 33).               Particular importance is attached by the War Office to the early-           implementation of this new organisation.      fl8616]                                                    c 2
                                 PART  II.                    INDICATION OF FUTURE REQUIREMENTS.     40.  The Home  Defence Committee consider that the  proposals  set forth in Part  I of this Report are the minimum now required  to provide a balancedsystem of air defence for this country.     Air  warfare is,  however, a  relatively new aspect  of war, and the methodsof attack and defence are continuously being improved.  No scheme of air defencecan  therefore at present be regarded as representing finality.     As stated in paragraph  2  above, certain proposals by  the  War Office fora further strengthening of the A.A.  and light A.A. gun defences have recentlybeen placed  before the Home Defence  Committee :  these proposals have been referred  to the  A.D.G.B. Sub-Committee.   For reasons which will  be  laterapparent the Home Defence Committee consider that  the War  Office proposals should now be brought to the notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence.     41.  Limitations of production preclude the immediate implementation of increases additional  to  those already recommended.   In the  meanwhile,  the relatively advanced stage of development Of the U.P. weapon  (described inparagraph 44) introduces a possible alternative to the gun as regards the further expansion of defences indicated above.     42.  A preliminary survey has accordingly been made of the increases in  gunor alternatively UP. defence  necessary to  provide a high measure of defence tomeet the anticipated scale of attack on important objectives  and  elsewhere tosatisfy the requirements of public morale.  The detailed results of a preliminary examination  are shown in Appendix E.   It will be noted that  these proposalsinvolve an  increase of 1,144 guns or, alternatively, a similar number of duplexU.P. projectors.     43.  The War  Office consider  that  the above would  represent a  very powerful and possibly necessary scale of defence.  The cost, however,  would bevery considerable and must have due regard to the best balance  as between air and  Ground Defence.  Moreover, firm data are not yet available with regard tothe U.P. weapon, and  further  expansion  of  the defence  must of  necessity, as previously stated, be at a later stage.U.P. Weapon.     44.  The U.P.  weapon is still under trial, but firm data should be available by the middle of 1939, thus enabling it to be introduced,  if satisfactory, on a small scale in 1940 (not before) and on a full scale in 1941.  The  U.P. projectile shouldhave an effect equal to, if not greater than, that of the  3-7-inch projectile.   the fire unit  will probably be 4 duplex projectors  (i.e., 8 barrels).     Its accuracy is not likely to  be as great as that of the gun, and it is therefore considered that one duplex projector should be deemed the equivalent of one3-7-inch gun.  It will be noted  that this ratio has been accepted in the detailedsurvey made in Appendix E.     45.  It will be convenient to  compare the  two gun zones  of the highest importance in Great Britain, firstly, in terms of the allotment of 78 new batteries,and, secondly, as regards the &quot; Expanded  Scheme &quot; outlined in Appendix E.7    London.     (i) Broadly speaking, the major  objectives in London lie within a  circle of           seven miles radius with centre  the  Tower.    (ii) With an increase of  78 batteries it is possible  to  allot 304 guns to  this           area.  This  implies  that a high gun density would not be  attained           until the attacker was in a position to bomb objectives well inside the.:          circle indicated above.   (iii) The addition of 256  guns,  making a  total of 560  guns,  would ensure a           high gun density as the attacker approached.  It  would be calculated           to break up any formation before an objective of major importance           could be reached.
The industrial block Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester,  Liverpool.     With  the  general increase of 78 batteries, as recommended  in  Part I ofthis Report, 240 guns are allotted to this area.  This gives a high measure ofprotection  for the actual cities mentioned above, but does not, generally speaking,cover the large and densely populated area lying between them.  By increasingthis number to  528 the  attacker attempting  a deep penetration into this area would be almost continuously under very heavy fire.     46.  Thus an  increase of about 550 guns  above  the  proposals  in  Part Iapplied in  the manner suggested above would render the attack of tlhe two mostimportant  areas in Great Britain extremely hazardous.  It should be noted thata  similar  provision of  duplex U.P. projectors for the above  defences  would constitute  a much  more powerful defence against formation attack.Further reduction in A .A. Gun A ammunition.     47.  In the event of further increases in 3-7-inch guns up to  the expandedscale indicated in Appendix E, being approved, a  further  decrease in  scale ofammunition as follows is acceptable :           London  area   ...    ...    ...     ...    ...     ...       2,000         Elsewhere     ..................       1,500     The increase would thus be          London area : 600 guns at 2,000 r.p.g..........    1,200,000         Elsewhere : 1,520 guns at 1,500 r.p.g..........    2,280,000        Total        .........    ......     ...    3,480,000Less provision for Present Defences at existing scales   ...    1,048,000Net increase..................     2,432,000Probable Future Developments in Light A .A . Defences.     48.   The reinforcement to the defences arising out of the increase in fighter and gun  strength recommended in this paper will tend, apart  from other con-siderations, to force an  enemy  to attempt low-flying  attack.   This calls  forcorresponding  increases in the strength of our defences against this form of attack, particularly against formation targets.     49.   Such a  reinforcement  might  be achieved, either  by  increasing  thenumbers of Light AA. Artillery weapons, or by the development of the 2-inchU.P. weapon.  This weapon will take the form of  a multiple barrelled projectorcapable of discharging large quantities  of projectiles simultaneously.  Little or no  data exists as  regards this weapon, but  it is a potential  solution to  theproblem of expanding the defences against low-flying attack in an economicalmanner.                                         !     50.  Examining  the  problem  of  further  expansion,  however, in terms ofincreasing the number of Light A.A.  Artillery weapons the  following increases would be  necessary :      Points for which 4-6 weapons have been allotted to be increased to    8     Points for which 7-10 weapons have been allotted to. be increased to   15     Points for which 11 and  over weapons have  been  allotted to be        increased to ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    20     On the above assumptions requirements  would be about 3,500 equipments,i.e.,  an increase of about 1,800 equipments over those previously recommended.     With this increased number  of equipments a further  reduction of ammirni-tion to 1,000  rounds per barrel  could be accepted.   Insufficient data exist to define the corresponding increases in terms of the 2-inch U.P. multiple projector.
Production.                                 ,    , - .    51.  In considering production the requirements of A.A. units other than.those in A.D.G.B., should also be included as follows(i) 3-7-inch guns.    (a)  A.D.G.B.

The production  programme  to  meet  the requirements  of 3-7-inchequipments, indicated in Part I, plus guns for Regular Units, Ports abroad, &amp;c.,.should be complete by the end of  1940.  Thereafter the existing capacity couldbe applied to any further increases which may be approved.  Production at thatdate should be at a rate of some 70 equipments per month.  It is the view of theWar  Office, however, that additional productive capacity should  be  created as-soon as possible.  If it were so created deliveries would start in 1940.  This wouldhave  the effect of greatly accelerating any further extensions of the programme.Even if it be  decided  as the result  of further examination by  the A.D.G.B.Sub-Committee that further extension of Air Defence  should not be in terms-of large numbers of guns the new capacity would be  a valuable asset to our war potential.     Similar considerations govern the production of  Light A.A. equipments.     53.   The approximate cost of tJhe above expansion of the defences would be -         (i)  On a gun cum U.P.  weapon basis :  34,000,000.

                            APPENDIX B.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  February 1939.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 346^ Meeting, held on February 9, 1939.        ******(3) REVIEW  OF ARRANGEMENTS  FOR  THE AIR DEFENCE  OF                            GREAT  BRITAIN.                         (C.I.D. Paper No. 308-A.)    (Previous reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 327th Meeting, Minute (5).)     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the HomeDefence Committee on a review of the Arrangements for the Air Defence of GreatBritain (C.I.D. Paper No. 308-A).     LORD CHATFIELD said that he wished at  the outset to impress upon theCommittee of Imperial Defence that the Memorandum before them made mention of two matters of a vitally secret character.  The first was R.D.F.   For someyears,  research,  necessarily conducted  under conditions  of great secrecy, hadbeen in progress on a radio method of  detecting aircraft and for locating their position.  The experiments had proved so successful that  a chain of Stationswas now being established on the East and South coasts of England as an integral part of the Fighter Defence  Organisation of this country.   It seemed probablethat the Dominion Governments would desire the R.D.F. system to be studied,.in order that they themselves might  take  advantage of  our knowledge and experience in connection with the development of  their  own future plans for air defence.  The value of R.D.F.  Stations was strictly related to an adequate Fighter&apos;Defence Organisation, but there was a variation of R.D.F. by which ships  couldbe located from  aircraft.  This should  prove  of particular  interest to  theDominions where, in general,  the risk of attack was likely to come from aircraftborne in carriers or other surface craft.     He suggested,  subject to  the  concurrence of the representatives of  theDominions present at the meeting, that information regarding this device shouldnot be communicated  to  their  respective Governments until they had had anopportunity of discussing the whole question with the Air Ministry, and reaching agreement as to the best procedure to be adopted.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD undertook to convene a meeting  to discuss this.matter.     MR. TE WATER warmly welcomed the suggestion and expressed the hopethat the meeting could take place as soon as possible.     MR. JORDAN and MR.  DUNCAN expressed agreement.    LORD CHATFIELD, continuing, said that there was also reference toanother very secret invention in Part II of the Report, namely, the U.P. Weapon.Hitherto, this had not been mentioned outside the Sub-Committee on Air defence research.  It was still one of the most secret matters in the whole of our armoury,and, apart from that, it had not yet reached a stage of development where it was.advisable or possible to enter into detailed explanations.     MAJOR-GENERAL ISM AY said that the memorandum was divided into two Parts. The first Part set out proposals as to  the immediate measures whichshould be taken to strengthen our A.A. defences in  view of changes in thesituation, and of scientific development.  Part II contained an outline of further       [18655-3]
far-reaching proposals which&apos;had been put before the Home Defence committee by the War Office, but which had not yet been examined.  He proposed, therefore,to confine his observations to the salient features of Part I.     As regards AA. guns, it would be recalled that the Cabinet had sanctionedan increase of new equipments up to the total specified in the &quot; Ideal Schemednamely, 1,264 guns.  In view of the increased scale of attack and of the fact that owing to the development of industry certain areas of the  country  had now become  more attractive air targets, it was recommended that in addition the320  3-inch guns should be also retained as an integral part of the defences.  Asregards light A.A. guns, a firm estimate had not  yet been worked out, but fromthe data so  far available, as indicated in paragraphs 31-32, the Home DefenceCommittee had reached the conclusion that  a minimum of  700 extra light AA.equipments  would be required.  In conclusion,  he invited  attention, to para-graph 38, in which  it was stated  that no AA. defences had  been included for northern Ireland.     MR. HORE-BELISHA, referring to paragraph 33 of the Memorandum, saidthat the  War Office were  anxious  to obtain  immediate approval  of their proposals for the creation of two more AA. divisions and the reorganisation ofthe defences  into two corps.  They did not for the moment contemplate a higherorganisation to co-ordinate the two divisions, but proposed that the instructions of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief should  be carried out, as  at present,through the Commander-in-Chief,  First A.A. Corps.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that, in view of the representations of theAir  Officer Commanding-in-Chief  (paragraph 34), he would like to discuss this.matter further with the Secretary of State for War.     MR. HORE-BELISHA  agreed.  Continuing, he said that the number ofAA. guns available  for the defence of London on the 1st March, 1939, would be approximately 300,  of  which about 150 would be  3-7-inch equipments.  the evening Standard had reported, that he (Mr. Hore-Belisha) had given 400 guns.as the present number for London.  This was a complete misrepresentation.   Inhis speech he had been careful to avoid, giving any figures.     SIR SAMUEL  HOARE felt strongly that steps should be taken to providedefences for Northern Ireland.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD suggested, and  the  Committee agreed, that theprovision of  local defences for  Northern  Ireland was desirable in principle andthat the Home Defence Committee should review the matter in detail.     SIR JOHN SIMON said that in view of the  priority which the cabinet had  accorded to the air defence  of this country, he was prepared to agree atonce that the proposals set out in Part I of the Memorandum under  discussion should be implemented forthwith.  At the same  time they  involved formidableexpenditure, both  capital and recurring; and he therefore found  it necessaryto stipulate that consideration would have to be given to the possibility of findingsome proportion of the cost involved by savings on other War Office items, eventhough  already approved, of a lower order of priority.   In this connection, thePrime Minister  had  convened  a meeting of the  Minister for  Co-ordination ofDefence, the Secretary of State for War, and himself (the Chancellor)  for thefollowing day to review the question of expenditure on the Field Force.     MR. HORE-BELISHA, turning to Part II of the Memorandum,  invitedattention to paragraph 40, in which the Home Defence Committee expressed theview that the proposals in Part I were the minimum now required to provide a balanced system of air defence.  This was clearly brought out in paragraph 45,which compared the gun zones of  London and the  Manchester-Liverpool area,We  had suffered in the past from not  taking a sufficiently  long view of  our requirements, and he urged most strongly that we  should look ahead as far aspossible with the special object of making sure that adequate productive capacityshould be available when required.  It took at least eighteen months to get new capacity into production.   Capacity should therefore anticipate requirements,if possible,  rather than lag behind as  always seemed to be  the case.  AlthoughPart II was concerned with  long-term proposals,  the  creation of  additional capacity now would mean a  saving of  a year if,  at  a later date, it was decidedto implement them.  In any case, our gun capacity was much below requirements;.Apart from the  requirements of  A.D.G.B., to  which the whole  capacity was
at present devoted, there was a shortage of all guns in the Regular&apos;&apos; and TerritorialArmies;-/until  A.D.G.B.  requirements had  been  met  there  was  no capacityavailable for the production of Field guns for the Regular Army or for equippingthe Territorial Army; the Dominions  might be in  a position  to send us troopsin time of war, but they could not provide guns or gun capacity;  there was nocapacity to meet the  requirements of our probable allies only recently the WarOffice had had to reject a request for 100 3 - 7-inch guns from Belgium, a countrywhose defence was of the closest interest to us.  The  detailed proposals  must clearly be given close examination and  must be considered  -ed  in relation to air defence as a whole,  but  in the meanwhile he. strongly urged  the  Committee toagree in principle that the War Office  should be authorised to increase capacity for gun production.  Although unable  to vouch for  the accuracy of the informa-tion,  he  had been told that the Germans had  5,500 medium  AA. guns and aproductive capacity  of 1,000 guns a  year.   This  was  quite  apart from  theirenormous productive capacity for other types of gun.  Our present capacity was between 30 and 40 guns a month and would eventually be between  800/900 gunsper year.  This was our total capacity  for all types  of gun for the Army.    SIR  SAMUEL  HOARE strongly endorsed the necessity for a long-termview.  He said that in our previous plans for A.A. gun defence  we seemed tohave been wrong every time; and he suggested that the Home Defence Committeeshould examine the proposals in  Part IT, with particular reference to productivecapacity, as soon as possible.    LORD STANHOPE was in favour of the  Secretary of State&apos;s proposal foran increase in gun capacity :  this was a sounder provision than the accumulation of stocks.    SIR KINGSLEY WOOD  agreed  that the matter should be treated as oneof urgency.    SIR JOHN SIMON pointed out that the proposals in Part II had not been examined by the Home Defence  Committee.  Nothing therefore was to be gained by discussing them at the present stage.                                CONCLUSIONS.     THE COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed :      (a) To approve  the proposals  put forward   in Part I  of  OLD.  Paper           No. 3&apos;08-A, namely :             Air Ministry.               (i) R.D.F.                     Provision of  full-scale R.D.F. Stations at  Kirkwall and                      Stonehaven.  Provision of two stations  on a reduced scale                      for the West of England.           War Office.               (ii) Searchlights.                      The replacement of 90  cm.  searchlights by the 150  cm.                      pattern up to  556 equipments.   No further  searchlight                      units to be formed for the present, but the matter to be                      reviewed  in the  light of  the  development of R.D.F.              (iii) A.A. Guns.                      (a) The retention of 320 3-inch guns as  an integral part of                            the defences.                      (b) The formation of up to 42 batteries of  3-7-inch static                            equipments as from the 1st April, 1939.                      (c) The  formation of  the   remainder  up  to  a total  of                            78 batteries on  or about the 1st November, 1939-                      [The Committee of Imperial Defence took note that when                      the question arose as to how the remainder of the batteries                      mentioned in (c) above should be formed, the War Office                      wished to take  into account the possibility of raising a                      proportion on a regular basis.]
          (iv) Ammunition.                 With the increase of 78 batteries referred to in (iii) (c)                 above, ammunition in terms of rounds per gun for 3 - 7-inch                 guns to be held on the following scale :                                                           Rounds                                                        per gun.                 London area    ...    ...    ...     ...    3,000                 Elsewhere       ............    2,000                 [This involves  an increase in the aggregate of 1,248,000                 rounds of 3-7-inch ammunition over the present approved                 scale.]          (v) R.D.F.  (Gun Control and Searchlight Control).                 R.D.F. to be introduced throughout the defences on the                 scale of one set per gun station and one  set per section                 of searchlights  (6  lights), plus  10 per cent, war reserves                 (total 1,284  sets).   The provision for searchlights to be                 reviewed in the light of further  experience.          (vi)  Light A.A. Guns.                 An  increase of 700 Light A.A. equipments additional to                 the  922 already authorised.  Units to be formed as  soon                 as a training scale of equipment can be provided.  Included                 in these increases should be a number of mobile batteries.         (vii) Higher Organisation.                 Subject to agreement being reached between the Secretary                 of State for War and the Secretary of State for Air, the                 expansion of the present organisation of one A.A. Corps                 of 5 divisions to two corps with a total  of 7  divisions.                 The new organisation to have effect as from the 1st April,                 1939.(b) With  reference to the  expenditure involved  in the above proposals, to      take note of the stipulation made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer      that it would be necessary to consider whether any proportion of the      cost involved   could  be found  from  savings  on other  War Office      measures, even  though already approved, which were of a lower order      of priority.(c) That the Home  Defence  Committee  should,  as  a matter of urgency,      examine and report on the proposals contained in Part II of C.I.D.      Paper No. 308-A, bearing  in mind the general views expressed in the      course of the above discussion, and the emphasis placed by several      members of the Committee on  the desirability of creating new gun      capacity as soon as possible.           For the purposes of this examination it would be necessary for      the War Office to give the Home Defence Committee a complete picture      of possible gun production requirements.(d)  That the Home Defence Committee should submit detailed proposals for      the defence of Northern Ireland against air attack.(e) To take note that the Secretary of State for Air would convene a meeting      for the purpose of expounding the present position as regards R.D.F.      to  representatives of  Canada,  Australia, New  Zealand and South      Africa,  and of concerting arrangements for  communicating  this-      information to  the Governments of the Dominions in question.    *           *          *          *           *          *Richmond Terrace, S.
