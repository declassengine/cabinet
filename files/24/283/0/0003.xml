This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government    ^ ^Printed for The  Cabinet, January, 1939.SECRET.CP. 30 (39)                              THE  CABINETDEFENDED  PORTS ABROAD.   ANTI-AIRCRAFT  DEFENCES      MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR    1. The  Committee of Imperial Defence, at their  345th Meeting  on 26th    091January, had under consideration  a report  by the Joint Overseas and  Home    3146Defence Committee which urged acceleration of the provision of anti-aircraft guns for Gibraltar, Malta and Aden. - ; 2. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed :     (a) To recommend to the Cabinet  some modification  of the decision that          absolute priority for Great Britain should be made in order to permit          of  acceleration in the  provision of  A.A.  equipment  and  R.A.F.          squadrons for the  defences of Malta, Gibraltar and Aden.    (b) To invite the  Secretary  of  State for War to submit to the Cabinet  for          simultaneous consideration a statement of the amount of acceleration          which he is prepared to recommend,  having regard to the rate of          production of A.A. equipment, the provision and training of personnel,          and the financial limitations at present imposed.  v    3. The Cabinet will be aware that the  priority referred to above is not, infact, &quot; absolute &quot;, as stated, but is a priority over other Army requirements only and does not in any direct sense  take precedence of the requirements of otherDefence Services.  Consequently, any acceleration of a programme for supplyingports abroad  has the  effect of  further  delaying the provision  of other army requirements which already have  been considerably affected by the priority givento the Air Defence of Great Britain.    4. My colleagues should further be aware that, while the guns for ports abroadwould normally be provided on  the dates specified in C.I.D. Paper 489-C annexed,there has been, in fact, no money available in the reduced army conspectus to  putin hand the building of the barracks services  required for the personnel on  thehigher Colonial establishment  approved by  the Cabinet on  23rd  March,  1938.There is further, owing to  the still existing gap  between  army  strength  and establishment,  a shortage of personnel.    5. In accordance with the Conclusion referred to in paragraph 2 above, I now make the following proposal :     If the Cabinet accept the immediate reinforcement of Ports abroad  at  theexpense of interference with the Air Defence  of Great Britain, my  proposal is tosend 24 guns, distributed as follows :                                                 3-inch guns  3 - 7-inch guns         Malta...............     ...    4             8         Gibraltar   ...     ...     ...    ......                   8         Aden  ...    ...     ...     ...    ...     ...                  4            (in each case with  1,000 rounds of ammunition a gun).    Of the above, four 3-inch guns and four  3 - 7-inch guns could  be sent at very short notice, the  remainder will follow as soon as possible.    6. My reason for sending four 3-inch guns is simply a question of urgency.They would be taken temporarily from Reserve guns of Regular A.A. units  and can be made ready for immediate despatch.   It will be noted that no 4-5-inch guns  are included.  Again, as  it is a question of urgency, 3 - 7-inch guns can be despatched earlier.            47COPY NO.   ?  8
    y. The result of this proposal will be that              Gibraltar will have 12 guns (as against the present 4)             Malta     ,,     ,,24  ,,  (as against the present 12)             Aden      ,,     ,,   6  ,,  (as against the present 2).    8. It is understood  that the Admiralty will allocate 2-pdr. guns to the ports in question for low-flying defence.  I welcome this arrangement;  the guns would,I assume, be manned under  naval  arrangements as  our difficulties  in  findingpersonnel are, at the moment, very acute.    9. Personnel. In view of the shortage  of British personnel the extra equip-ments at Gibraltar  and  Malta must be manned, as an emergency measure, by theexisting R.A. units.   This will entail dilution by semi-trained or  recruit gunnersof the  Royal  Malta  Artillery and  possibly by locally enlisted Gibraltarians at gibraltar.  If the latter fail we must send some men; though at the expense ofsome  other port.  Aden has no potential man power so that it will be necessaryto despatch 2 officers  and 76 other ranks,  R.A.    10. Accommodation. Extemporised  arrangements will have to be made atonce at Gibraltar and Malta.   At Aden, although some accommodation is already available, it will be  necessary to erect hutting near the gun positions.  This wouldnot be wasted as it will be available as war accommodation.    11. Steps should  also be immediately  taken  to put in hand the necessarypermanent accommodation.   Except in  the  case of  Gibraltar,  this is already under discussion with the Treasury.  Authority is requested in principle to putin hand the accommodation at Gibraltar as well as the other ports.     .  ;:                                                                  L. H.-B.

    ANNEXURE(C.I.D. Paper 489-C)   Memorandum by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Sub-Committee.Introduction.    AT their  331st Meeting (Minute (n)), the Committee of  Imperial Defencerecorded the following conclusions :     &quot; (a) To approve the proposals of the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Com-          mittee in C.I.D. Paper No. 475 C for anti-aircraft defences at certain          Category &quot;A &quot; ports abroad, as summarised in Columns (/), (g) and           (h)  of  Appendix  &quot;A,&quot;  which  represent,  in  conjunction with the          defences previously approved (vide Columns (b), (c), (d) and (e)), the  -;  i      minimum provision and the immediate requirements  for the  ports          concerned.    (b) To  approve, as  desirable, the  additional defences for Malta and Aden          shown in brackets in Columns (/), (g) and (h) of Appendix &quot; A &quot; of        ^ C.I.D. Paper No. 475-C.    (c) To take note that in the opinion of the Naval  Staff the defences referred          to in (a) above would not provide really adequate  protection for the          ports concerned.    (d) To  instruct the  Joint Oversea and  Home Defence Committee to keep          under constant review the scales  of anti-aircraft defences approved          for the defended ports abroad, with a view to their further increase          if circumstances should demand, and finance and industrial produc-          tion permit.&quot;    2. In accordance with the above conclusions, and at the request of the Chiefof the Naval Staff, the Joint  Oversea  and Home Defence  Committee have had under review the anti-aircraft defences  of Gibraltar, Malta and Aden in the lightof developments in the international situation.    3. Early in the course of  their discussions the Committee realised that therewere two sides to the problem, the one of immediate concern, and the other of lessurgency, though still of great importance.   The first part of the problem relates to the present approved scales of anti-aircraft defences at these ports, and therate at which they are being completed.  The Committee  are so impressed  withthe gravity of the position that they feel it their duty  to bring it to the notice ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence forthwith, while proceeding with their inves-investigation of the second part, i.e., the review of existing approved  scales.  their recommendations  on the  latter  must  await the completion  of the EuropeanAppreciation now being prepared by the Chiefs of Staff.Rate  of Flow  of Anti-Aircraft Equipment.    4. The  following table  shows  for each of the three ports the  present approved scales together with the probable dates  of  completion:           Gibraltar.ExistingApprovedCompletion date         Malta.ExistingApprovedCompletion date         Aden.ExistingApprovedCompletion dateLight guns.  ^-in. guns.  3-7&apos;-in. guns. ^-^-in. guns.

If retained, they           could not be manned unless extra units were raised.(2754)                                                                A &quot;
Anti-Air craft Guns.    5. The supply of 3-7-inch and 4-5-inch guns to these ports has been subjectto the general Cabinet ruling that the Air Defence of Great Britain must have priority over everything else.   The result has been  that up to  the present no3-7-inch guns  have  yet been  sent abroad, and under present arrangementsdelivery to the three ports under review will not start until March  1939. 4-5-inch guns, the production of which is now beginning, will not be available for any ofthe three ports before September 1939.  Since 4-5-inch guns are to constitute thetotal of anti-aircraft guns at Aden, three-quarters at Gibraltar,  and two-thirdsat Malta, the ports in question will be practically defenceless until September1939.   No acceleration of these figures is possible without a modification of thepresent ruling as to priority of supply.Searchlights.     6. The supply situation is fairly satisfactory in that all three ports will be complete by June 1939;  but the man-power to serve those lights, which are being sent out in the Spring, will not be available until the trooping season 1939-40.Light A.A.

No R.D.F. sets will be available before June 1939 at the earliest.  the installation of R.D.F. at those bases which can be approached by aircraft overthe sea, is a matter of grave urgency.R.A.F.

The coast and air defence units of these three ports are  still on  LowerColonial Establishment, which means  that  they can only man a  portion  of the approved armament.    At a meeting on  the 23rd March, 1938,* the cabinet approved a recommendation  by the Committee  of  Imperial Defence  to thefollowing effect:          &quot; To  recommend that the principle should be re-established and rigidly    observed in the future that, wherever their communications are liable to    interruption, our overseas garrisons should be maintained in peace time at    a strength adequate for defence on the  outbreak of war; or alternatively that    the necessary  reserves should  be held in the neighbourhood  available, to.    reinforce at short notice.&quot;    This decision is tantamount, in the case of Malta and Aden, to authority forthe garrison at those ports to be kept at Higher Colonial Establishment.  TheTreasury  Inter-Service Committee  has  recently approved in principle that the* Vide C.I.D./313th Meeting Minute ,(i).
garrisons of Malta and Aden should be raised to Higher Colonial Establishmentprovided that the War  Office can finance the proposal from a new conspectus.We would  urge most strongly that the necessary increase in garrisons should nolonger be delayed.Accommodation.    II. The provision of permanent accommodation to house increased garrisonsat Gibraltar, Malta and Aden is similarly held up for lack of funds.  The positionis set out in full in the Annex.Conclusions.    12. The Joint Oversea  and Home Defence  Committee would be failing intheir duty  if  they did  not draw  the attention of  the  Committee of  ImperialDefence  to the serious  gaps which exist in the anti-aircraft defences of these important bases, as disclosed by the facts set out above, to the length of  time that will elapse before even the existing scale of defences is completed, and tothe fact that no  acceleration is possible  unless the ruling that the Air Defenceof Great Britain is to have obsolute priority is modified.    13. The measures which call for urgent consideration may  be summarisedas follows:      (i)  The rate of supply of equipment.         (a) The acceleration of the provision of 3 - 7-inch and 4 - 5-inch guns up               to present approved scales.         (b) The immediate provision of a mobile R.D.F. set at Malta.         (c) The acceleration of provision of Bofors single equipments for Aden               and Malta.         (d) The acceleration of R.A.F. squadrons.     (ii) Provision of man power.             Immediate steps to be sanctioned to bring the strength of the units         required to man the present  approved scale of  anti-aircraft  defences at         Malta and Aden up to Higher Colonial Establishment.     (iii) Accommodation.             Approval to proceed forthwith with the programme of provision         of accommodation for the anti-aircraft units required.                          (Signed)     E.

The Secretary,         Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee.       I. Raising of certain Garrisons to Higher Colonial Establishment.    The decision to raise certain  ports abroad  from  L.C.E.  to H.C.E.  was approved by Cabinet in March 1938,  but this  has not yet been implemented. Financial approval for these measures has been delayed and application for funds has not yet  been submitted to T.I.S.C.  This should be done  without further- delay,  since  the full manning of our  defences  at the  more  essential naval bases depends on the provision of this extra personnel and on accommodation for them.          II. Accommodation Situation Gibraltar, Malta and A-den.Gibraltar. .2.  The decision  to raise the garrison to  Higher Colonial Establishment isin obeyance  for financial  reasons,  and  in consequence the barrack constructionscheme, which was  estimated  to  cost  approximately  500,000, will not now becarried out.    3.  The existing barracks will,  in all probability, be  unable to house morethan the present Lower Colonial Establishment, which will leave the followingarmament unmanned : Coast Defence     Lower Group ...     ...     ...    ...    ...    ....     3-9-2-inch.    Tovey    A.M.T.B. defences   ......    Defence Electric Lights   - Anti-Aircraft2-6-inch.2 equipments.68-4 - 5-inch.    4. The  War  Office  is  at  present examining  the  barrack  situation  at gibraltar with  a view to  accommodating as much as possible of the personnelrequired to man the above eight 4 - 5-inch A.A. guns.Malta.    5. The accommodation requirements for the  implementation of the  policywhereby the garrison is to be raised from L.C.E. to H.C.E. have been submittedby  G.O.C., Malta.    6. The outstanding feature of the scheme  is the expansion of the  RoyalMalta  Artillery from its  present strength of approximately  500 to a total  of1,650.    7. Malta have, in addition to planning  for this increased garrison, to buildtwo new  barracks for  infantry  battalions as well as reconstruct  two existinginfantry barracks. New barracks will be required for one anti-aircraft regimentand a  mobile artillery regiment.    8. It is safe to assume that it will  take three years to complete this  pro-gramme,  and, as a temporary measure, Malta propose  to  house troops  in thewar accommodation at outlying forts. This is not a  satisfactory solution to theproblem, but on the grounds of economy it will have  to be accepted.Aden.    9. New barracks for  one Hong Kong-Singapore R.A.  anti-aircraft battery(eight  4 - 5-inch and four 2-pdrs.)  and for one British  searchlight battery (twelvelights) are to be built.  The plans are being worked out in conjunction with theAir Ministry, who are responsible for construction, and it is reported that these-barracks will not be ready for three years.    10. As a temporary measure, the anti-aircraft personnel are to be housedin existing buildings  at Sheikh Othman.
Conclusions.    II.  Enough information has been given above to show that there is a grave risk of accommodation difficulties at these three ports, which may lead to seriousdelays in the  full manning of  the  approved  defences,  and  that  makeshiftarrangements are  already  relied upon to  carry out the policy approved by theCabinet as long ago as February 1938.    12.  It is clear, therefore, that any personnel in  addition to that required forthe present approved armament must be housed in temporary accommodation forthe next two years.             III. Personnel Situation Gibraltar, Malta and Aden.    13. Any additions to the  existing garrison at Gibraltar would be entirelyBritish,  and therefore subject  to  the limitations imposed by the  recruitingsituation.    14. At Malta, the expansion of  the garrison is to be almost entirely Maltese,an increase of about  1,100 being required.   These, it is hoped, will be recruitedby the end of 1939, but they will not, of course, be efficient by that date.  It willprobably be two years before the approved armament will be properly manned.    15. At  Aden, the  expansion  is  largely  for  the approved  anti-aircraft defences.  The guns are to be manned by  a Hong-Kong-Singapore Battery, R.A.,the first draft of which will reach Aden in May, 1939.   The remaining  200  oddwill be recruited during 1939, but will  not be trained to efficiency until the latterend of 1940.    16. It will thus be seen  that, from the point of view of provision of personnel to man any additions to the approved armament at these three ports, it will not,in practice, be possible to man  efficiently any such additions for  a further periodof about three years.
