Appreciation of the political Situation,  by theGovernment of India, dated 18th  January, 1939.     Circulated for the information of the Cabinet bythe Secretary of State for India.
                                                       (J (confidential appreciation of the  Political situationin India,  dated the 18th january  IQ^Q  L,l     !?oiithnri+ir  n-p +V,  o    .   &quot;t-umaiy, ujy,  issued on theauthority  ol the Secretary of State for  India.         Political  Conferences.    During  the.Christmas season,  as  usual,  a number  of political conferences  have been  held,  not  all of  a kind to  promote goodwill  among men. The National  Liberal Federation,  after describing the new constitution  as utterly unsatisfactory, states  in familiar terms the modifications which would make  it acceptable:  and cautiously  advises the Indian Princes to  satisfy  the legitimate  aspirations of their  people for civil  and political liberties.    The Hindu MahgsaBha alarmed  by the design attributed  to the  Muslim League  to organise a federation of Muslim units (^Pakistan&quot; ) inside and outside  British India, desires the inauguration  of the federal  scheme of the Constitution Act, however defective:  condemns Congress only  less-vigorously than Muslims, and claims to  be the only  national organisation  in the country:  complains of the oppression of  Hindu subjects  by certain Muslim Rulers: and demands general military training in  order  to counteract the preponderance  of Muslims in  the Indian Army and to lay the foundation for a national militia.   Meanwhile the muslim League conducted a crowded session at  Patna in an atmosphere  of enthusiastic militancy.  in order to protectMuslims from alleged oppression by certain Congress&quot;Ministries  the &quot;working Committee has been authorised toproceed to  &quot;direct action&quot;  if and when necessary:,  rejection of the Federal scheme was repeated, but - in terms that are interpreted as covering the  &quot;Pakistan&quot; design - thePresident has been quthorised to explore the possibility of an acceptable alternatives,  as regards the States, if
                                                      2. the  Congress  and  other Hindu  organisations will not desist from their  subversive activities, the League will be forced  to take  action to safeguard the legitimate interests of Muslims-.   The resolution  on Palestine affirmed the unity of the  Muslim  world, demanded that the immigration of Jews should  cease immediately and that the Grand Mufti and  representative Indian Muslims should be included in the conference, and threatened extreme measures to free the Arabs from the clutches of British  domination and Jewish usurpation if their claims were not satisfied.        Finally, the Working  Committee of the Congress met at Bardoli from January 11th  to 13ths  some weeks earlier the correspondence  between the Presidents of the Congress and the muslim League was brought to  a close by a letter which intimated to Mr. Jinnah the conclusion of the working committee that  nothing further could be done in negotiation with  the League to settle the Hindu-Muslim questions  but it is believed that at Bardoli consideration was given, at Mr.Gandhi&apos;s instance, to a body  of instructions that should beissued to Congress Ministries to define their attitude tominorities.   2-   Indian  States.  -  The interest shewn in the States byall political organisations reflects the importance attachedto the impending approach to the Rulers on the subject of federation.    The meddling of Congress in their affairs was mentioned in the last&apos; Appreciation.   At the beginning ofDecember Mr. Gandhi claimed, with particular reference tothe States bordering Orissa, that &quot;the Ministers inautonomous Provinces have surely a moral responsibilityregarding what happens  in the States&quot;.   A month later aPolitical Officer, Major Bezalgette, was beaten to death bya mob in one of those States.    A somewhat grudging admission
 of responsibility for  the rousing  of uncontrollable passions may be read into the resolution of the Working Committee which recorded deep regret at the murder and the conviction  that mob violence will  injure the cause of freedom in the States.    In Eajkot State a sudden irruption ofTallabhai Patel resulted on Christmas Day in a settlement by the terms of which  a committee  is to be appointed to frame a scheme of reforms 5  in Hyderabad on the other hand the influence of Messrs. Gandhi and J.Nehru has been exertedto  procure  suspension  of the political agitation againstthe State administration.     3*   The Irovinoes-  -  In Sind the Legislature met inthe beginning of  January, -for the  first time since June.The Ministry scored a  signal victory by defeating a motion ofno-confidence by the wide margin of 32 votes to 7.   TheCongress party remained neutral.   The victory was the moreremarkable  for the refusal of the Ministry to woo support bya  surrender on the Barrage assessment question.          In Assam the &quot;political&quot; convicts still in jail,nine in number, have been released, the Ministry havingsatisfied themselves that they have abjured terrorism.fn  Bengal the Government, being pledged to review the sentences of the  large number of terrorist prisoners, have appointed a committee  for the purpose with a retired HighCourt Judge as President.   The labour trouble in the juteindustry has...been settled:  and the situation in the Biharcollieries  has improved.   Three thousand workers employedby  the Bata Shoe  Company in Bengal went&apos;on strike early inJanuary, and the police were forced to fire on an unruly crowd:no  one was  killed.   The strike is reported to have been settled on  January 16th.   The long-continued strike in theGokak mills (Bombay) has also ended, after some disturbanceof the peace.
                                                         4.     4.    Scarcity  conditions  in the. south-east Pun j.ah  are acute.   Rain  is  badly  needed  all over  the Punjab, Delhi and  the United Provinces,  and  prospects for the spring harvest are  at present  poor.     5.    Another railway  disaster occurred in Bihar  on January 12th;  so far as can be ascertained about 20  persons were killed  and a large number were injured;  the disaster was  caused by  the deliberate removal of a. rail from the line.     6*    Waziristan  - The Faqir of Ipi still refuses to accept the peace  terms  offered to him.   He has been  moving about in North Waziristan  close to the Durand Line and  air action has been taken against villages which have harboured him. .  In  the  middle of December a Column of troops visitedMshazai country in South Waziristah where hostiles have been giving trouble.    The  operation was successful and almost all the hostiles  concerned were brought in by the tribal leaders.   The Column was  heavily sniped during its march down from Razinak  and some  casualties resulted.   The  ShabiKhel Mahsuds who were chiefly responsible for this were ordered to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- and 20 magazine  rifles and surrender  20 hostages.   The order has been complied with.At the beginning  of January a hostile gang was active in theDera. Ismail IChan district.   Their activities culminated in a raid on a village in which two Hindus were killed and threekidnapped.   Frontier Constabulary and Police got into  touchwith the gang  but were  unable to prevent their return totribal territory.   A land blockade hps been instituted against the AhmadZai Wezirs on the Bannu border owing totheir failure  to deal with a. notorious raider named MehrDil.
