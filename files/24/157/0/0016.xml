GREAT BRITAIN.Cabinet Unemployment Committee. The following is taken from the report of the Ministry of Labour on unemployment for 21st October : The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August 1920 there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole cpiestion and devise means for relieving unemployment.This Committee has since been inconstant session and has up to the 24th October 1921 held 35 meetings.The problem of unemployment in one form or another has also been before the Cabinet on 51 occasions between the 13th August .1920 and the 24th October 1921.(A.) Unemployment Insurance. An Unemployment Insurance Bill of general scope was introduced on the 23rd December 1919, reintroduced on the 16th February 1920, received a third, reading in the Commons on the 19th July 1.920, passed into law on the 9th August 1920, and came into operation on the 8th November 1920.This Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. The weekly rates of benefit, paid out of contributions from employers, employed and the State, were 15s. for men and 12s. for women, after a &quot;waiting period &quot; of three days. In general, the amount of benefit was limited to one week for every six contributions paid, but during the first year eight weeks&apos; benefit could be drawn after four contributions had been paid. .An amending Act of the 23rd December 1920 granted eight weeks&apos; benefit up to the 31st March 1921, to persons who had paid no contributions but had been employed for a certain minimum period in an insured trade in 1920.A further amending Act of the 3rd March 1921 increased the rate of benefit to 20s. for men and 16s. for women. It further provided that during each of the-periods March-October 1921. and November 192.1--July 1922,16 weeks&apos; benefit could be drawn by persons who had been employed in an insured trade in. 20 weeks since the end of .1919 and were normally employed in an insured trade genuinely seeking wdiole-time employment and unable to obtain it.   .A. third amending Act of the 1st July 1921 reduced the.rate of benefit to 15s. for men and 12s. for women and increased the &quot;waiting period&quot; to six days. This change was necessitated by exhaustion of funds owing to the great amount of -unemployment, and was coupled with a heavy increase in contributions and authority : to borrow money from the Treasury to the extent of 20,0,00,00021, as compared with 10,000,0002. previously. At the same time power was taken to allow 22 weeks&apos; benefit (instead of 16) in each of the periods March-October 192.1 and November 1921-July 1922. vBetween the 8th November 1920 and the .15th October 1921 the amount paid in unemployment benefit was 48,600,0002. Of this amount the contribution of employers since the 8th November was 8,8 64,0002., that of employed persons &apos; 8,253,0002. and that of the State 4,4 08,0002. in addition to&apos; 1,524,0002. in respect of benefit for ex-regular sailors, soldiers and airmen. The balance was provided mainly out of the accumulated reserve fund of over 20,000,0002. and advances by the Treasury amounting to 4,365,0002,The number of persons in receipt of benefit was on the 1st July 1921- 2,062,012 wholly unemployed and 988,364 on part time, and on. the 14th October 1921, 1,077,985 wholly unemployed and 287,300 on part-time.(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.  A sum of 10,400,0002. was provided for expenditure on arterial roads,&apos; half to be given by way of actual grant, and half by-way of a loan to local authorities. This money is administered by the Ministry of. Transport and is expended by local authorities under their supervision. The men to be employed are selected by the local employment committee of the employment exchange and&apos;preference is given to ex-service men.A further sum of 3,000,0002. was allocated to the Unemployment Grants Committee, presided over by Lord St. Davids, for the purpose of assisting local authorities to carry out at once works on which a substantial number of unemployed could be engaged.   The conditions imposed with regard to the expenditure of this
-money were that works could only be approved in areas where there existed serious unemployment which was not otherwise provided for, that the men employed should&apos; be taken from the registers of the employment exchanges, preference being given to&apos; ex-service men, and that any grant paid should not exceed 60 per cent, (originally. -30 per cent.) of the wages bill, of additional men taken on for the work.   Further, the works had to be such as were approved by the appropriate department of the -Government as suitable works of public utility.   The condition as to recruitment of labour through the employment exchanges has since been modified so as to permit local authorities to draw all or a portion of this labour from boards of guardians. A condition has also been imposed by which local authorities carrying out schemes by means of direct labour may not pay to unskilled men wages higher than 75 per -cent, of the authority&apos;s rate for unskilled workmen.In addition to the items outlined above, assistance from the Ministry of Transport has enabled local .authorities to maintain in employment on road maintenance a number of men beyond those ordinarily employed, on this work. Additional employment has also been provided by expediting work on sites and sewers for housing schemes, An emergency programme undertaken by the Office of Works, and the introduction, of alternative work and a &quot;system of short-time working in Government industrial establishments have further assisted towards relief of the situation.In addition, local authorities have been encouraged by the Government to put work in hand without receiving definite Government assistance.In all, it is estimated that an expenditure of approximately 25,000,000?. has been incurred on schemes of public work undertaken by the Government and the , local, authorities, either separately or acting together, and that at least 200,000 men have from time to time been provided with work by this means.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., li, p. 4].--The Viceroy reported [1.9-13] on 26th October that the situation, in Waziristan remained generally quiet. On 18th October a heavy spate had occurred in Shahur Tangi, which had caught some of the road protective troops between precipitous cliffs, resulting in the loss by drowning of 2.1 Indian&apos;other ranks.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., lv, p. 4]. Replying to the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram [5323] of 19th October, the, Viceroy telegraphed [21 0.] on 23rd October that the reduction of military expenditure which was &apos; contemplated was that which would result from the evacuation of Wana on the-announcement of our policy to theMahsuds and the Wana Waziri, which Sir Henry Dobbs thought it was now expedient to make [20 0.]. The Viceroy concurred in Sir Henry&apos;s recommendation. The great stumbling-block, to reduction was the uncertainty of our relations with the Amir, and the -consequent necessity of military expenditure in Waziristan. Were this uncertainty to be removed and good relations with. Afghanistan to be established, a limit to frontier -expenditure could be foreseen, but&apos;without it none could be anticipated.On 24th October the Viceroy reported [2452 S.] that Sir Henry Dobbs was pressing for leave to return to India for several members of the mission in consequence of sickness, overstrain and private troubles.   Sir Henry proposed, to send back with them. the greater part of the Indian personnel.The Secretary of State telegraphed [5524] to the Viceroy on 28th October saying that lie had carefully considered the whole question in the light of the Viceroy&apos;s replies in his telegram of 23rd October. He regretted to find, himself not in entire accord regarding the Viceroy&apos;s grounds for his anticipations of.reduction of military expenditure as a direct result of the conclusion of a treaty. Without discussing the merits or otherwise of the treaty, he found himself faced with a difficulty which seemed to him to be insuperable. His Majesty&apos;s Government, since early in May, had consistently made the full disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty the sine qua non condition, of their reluctant assent to the pis alter treaty. The Amir had flatly refused to make that disclosure.
In view of this, together with such, matters as the impropriety of granting a-subsidy to the Amir, who had already secured one from a Power hostile to ourselves, and the Amir sgenerally tuiaccommodating altitude, it was impossible for His Majesty&apos;s&apos;-Gbvernment to revoke their carefully considered decision. The time had .come, therefore, when our interests and our prestige demanded that an end should be put-to negotiations which had been rendered futile by the Afghan attitude.Instructions should be sent to Sir Henry Dobbs to inform the Amir that an exclusive treaty with us had been made impossible by his own action in ratifying a treaty with the Bolsheviks ; and seeing that he hail declined to accept the condition on which IBs Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to offer a neighbourly treaty, and,, further, had entered on a Bolshevik alliance, negotiations could, only be adjourned until he was in a different frame of mind. This was not to be taken as modifying in any way the desire of His majesty&apos;s Government to live on friendly terms with Indian-Islamic neighbour, and to show their good faith they were willing to invest those-terms with the sanction of a treaty. Such a treaty had in fact been laid before the Amir, who had so far rejected it. Without being an ideal treaty, it recognized Afghan independence and embodied, the relations existing between, great Powers. The Amir-would be well advised to give it serious consideration before finally rejecting a treaty on. which the verdict of the civilized world would certainly be invited.The ATceroy acknowledged [2485 S.] the above telegram on 1st November,, expressing the regrets of the Council at the decision. With the possibility of the Amir at the last moment making a full disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty and suing for a treaty with subsidy, the Government of India were not in a position to give final instructions to Sir Henry Dobbs. They assumed, however, that in such case the previous authority for Sir Henry, to present the draft treaty of friendship still held good. After discussing the advantages and disadvantages likely to accrue, and advancing arguments to show that a treaty of friendship would relieve us of the disadvantages and secure to us the advantages anticipated, the Viceroy stated that, in the opinion of the Council, it would be worth while to waive the disclosure of the-Bolshevik treaty in return for the A.mir&apos;s written assurance on the tenor of the undisclosed matter-. The Viceroy regarded such a treaty as being no advance in concessions of substance, which we had been prepared to make in order to secure an exclusive treaty, but rather as a- concession of form.In asking for directions in the event of the Amir making a voluntary disclosure,, the Government of India begged His Majesty&apos;s Government to reconsider their decision upon the main point.The Secretary of State replied [5630] to the above on 3rd&apos; November. While regretting disagreement with the Government of India, he stated that Bis Majesty&apos;-b Government found it impossible to reverse their decision, on account of the objections-to dispensing with the disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty. In a less degree these objections applied to the offering of apis aller treaty, but were sufficiently, decisive: Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; report of the meeting of 19th September, at which he informed the Afghans that in consequence of their failure to disclose the Bolshevik treaty His Majesty&apos;s Government had been compelled to abandon all idea of a treaty of intimate friendship, and to close negotiations on that score, exactly represented the views of His M&apos;ajesty&apos;s Government, Sir Henry Dobbs was to be instructed, therefore, that -whether the Amir now disclosed the Bolshevik treaty or not, he should act on the lines indicated in. the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 28th October.The Viceroy&apos; Report. The following report was sent on 26th October :-Madras. gandhis recent tour in tho presidency was a comparative failure, his advocacy of a boycott of foreign cloth exciting little enthusiasm. The vigorous use of the security sections of the Criminal Procedure Code against the leaders and touring-agitators has produced good results. The prosecution for intimidation in connexion with the boycotting of liquor shops has also had the desired effect. The visit of a company of British troops to Bezwada, Guntur and Ellore attracted large crowds and had a salutary effect.Central Provinces. The political atmosphere is fairly quiet. There was some increase in the number of meetings. The Mahratta leaders have not yet openly split with Gandhi, and appear to be waiting till the end of the year to define their policy.. There are some signs of increased activity in the organization of volunteers, but the local Government doubt whether the scheme will advance much beyond the paper stage.
Delhi. Dussera passed off quietly though there was a tendency to bait and annoy the polipe on the part of the volunteers. A careful census of the volunteer bodies is being prepared with a view to action against the more objectionable bodies. Meetings regarding the proscribed leaflets) and the fatwa continue iii Delhi as elsewhere ; but so far it does not appear probable that such meetings and other efforts to excite agitation on this subject are likely to produce deep or very serious effect. A meeting of the All-India congress committee and the working committee is to be held at Ansari Douse in Delhi on 4th November.Assam.-A strike and some rioting have occurred on.the Sonajuli and Kachargaon tea gardens in the Darrang district. Some violence was shown towards Europeans, but none were seriously injured. Seven Indian employees, four shopkeepers and several coolies received injuries; one of the Indian employees being seriously hurt. Two.thousand coolies from Kachargaon. marched to Tezpur on the 12th, but were persuaded by the deputy commissioner to return to work. The alleged grievances .are mainly low pay, strict discipline, and insufficient leave. The coolies of both gardens are now back at work. The death of three coolies reported by the Indian News Agency is false. .A. riot also occurred at the Dbenclai tea gardens in the same district, at which Grace, superintendent of police, was knocked down and beaten, but not seriously injured.   Fifty-two rioters were arrested by the deputy-commissioner.Bihar. The meetings of the provincial congress and caliphate committee at Arrah fell rather flat, though the speeches were, marked by violence, and included n resolution to boycott the Prince&apos;s visit. The attendance was small, and generally speaking there is a lull in the non-co-operation campaign pending their (? omission) -owing to lack of instructions from leaders. The commissioner&apos;of Patna reports that, apart from the meetings and speeches, the minds of the people are not affected, and the present situation is not disquieting. Candidates come forward in large numbers for appointments in the subordinate police executive services, The excise revenue in Patna district is in excess of last year.United Provinces.--There has been some increase in the volume and violence -of speeches, particularly in Oudb. The reiteration of the Karachi resolutions has been prominent in certain places. Miizapur, however, reports a noticeable change in public feeling owing to the Moplah excesses. The Ram Lila festival at Agra was marked by ah absence of political demonstration or racial feeling. The Aman Sabha continues to extend the scope of their usefulness.General. The boycott&apos;of foreign cloth maintains its position as the most prominent item in the non-co-operation programme, but there are signs that the country as a whole is growing tired of it. In a notice by Motilal Nehru, general secretary of the All-India congress committee, to all the members of the committee, published in the press of 20th October, a statement is made that early in December we shall either be in full view of swaraj, oi all prominent persons, including Gandhi, will&apos;be in jail. This may possibly indicate the intention of the congress committee to decide on some such step as the proclamation of civil disobedience at the meeting tixed for 4th November at Delhi with the object of forcing the issue. There is a general rumour that, on the occasion of the visit of the Prince of Wales, a general amnesty for political.offenders will be proclaimed. The information from Bihar and Orissa is to the effect that there is reason to believe that the provincial leaders, under instructions from the central committee, are preparing to revive intense agitation throughout, the province some time late in October or early in November. Circular letters have been drafted (1) appealing to students to boycott Government institutions; (2) calling upon lawyers to suspend practice ;(3) requiring&apos;.Government servants immediately to resign the service of Govern-in ent, and to rally to the congress flag.It is understood that these circulars will issue on receipt of instructions from. -Gandhi, and it is believed that similar instructions will issue at the appointed time throughout India. Orders to print have already been marked on the draft circulars. Of the first of these, 25,000, of the second 40,000 and of the third 75,000 copies willbe made.
THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.The Washington. Conference, -On 81st October the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary ol: State for the Colonies as follows: -In accordance with.the terms of the order in Council approved 27th October-regarding the forthcoming conference as to the limitations of armaments and on the-Pacific ami far eastern questions summoned by the Government of the United States to-meet at Washington on 11th November, it is desired that His Majesty may lie humbly moved to issue letters patent to Sir- B-. P. Borden, naming and. appointing him commissioner and plenipotentiary in respect of the Dominion of Canada, with lull power&apos;and authority to conclude -with such plenipotentiaries as may be vested with similar power and authority on the part of any Powers or Stales an,)&apos; treaties-conventions or agreements in connexion with, the said conference and to sign for and in the name of His Majesty the King, in respect of the Dominion of Canada, every-thing so agreed upon and concluded, and to transact all such other matters as may appertain thereto.The Washington Conference, On 5th November the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that an. order in Council was issued on 2nd November in regard to the Washington conference. In the preamble it Was stated that it was expedient that His Majesty should be represented at the conference in respect of the Commonwealth of Australia, It was then ordered : That His Majesty the King be humbly moved to issue letters patent to the lion. George Poster Pearce, Minister of State for the Commonwealth of Australia, naming and appointing him as His Majesty&apos;s representative in respect of the Commonwealth of Australia, at the said conference.Immigration Policy. The following was issued by the London office of the commonwealth on 7th November : The acting High Commissioner for Australia has received- the following cabled advice from the Prime Ministers Department, Melbourne : A conference.held in Melbourne this week of Commonwealth and State Ministers has arrived at an important agreement regarding immigration. It was decided that-each State should formulate a definite scheme, making available such land as is suitable for settlement; this scheme to be in the nature of a contract between the States and the Commonwealth, thus allowing the latter to give immigrants those-positive assurances concerning land for settlement which are essential to a successful policy of immigration.Mr. Hughes, Prime Minister, said : &quot;We need people for our great empty spaces-to cultivate our rich lands. If we can people the country the towns can look after themselves.   But we must find profitable markets overseas for our produce.&quot;The conference agreed to -improve Australia&apos;s export trade by the adoption- of uniform standards to ensure the marketing of only quality goods, and it approved of; the appointment of businessmen to Great Britain and elsewhere whose function it would be to push Australian goods.Imports and Exports. The official secretary of the Commonwealth in London. wrote as follows on 3rd November : I have to advise-yon that the values of the goods imported to and exported from Australia during the month of September 1921 were-as-follows : AUSTRALIA.Imports.Exports: 7,698,239Australian produce Other produce 8,730,128 351,142Total   -9,081,270
-   -     NEW. ZEALAND.- Butter and Cheese.-The following telegram was sent by the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 30th October :-The Prime Minister states that the New Zealand dairy farmers are-alarmed at the prospect of another fall in the prices of butter and cheese, and have suggested to him that if the British authorities would for the time being refrain&apos; from placing op the market the butter which they have in store it would have a good effect in stabilizing prices. New Zealand is at present suffering from a financial stringency caused by a fall in the prices of her principal products, and.for this reason the Prime Minister would be very glad if the request could be agreed to. He would be grateful if you would convey these representations to the proper quarter.SOUTH AFRICA.Labour for the Rand.--Qn 3rd November the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Prime Minister had requested him to convey the following message and to repeat it to the Governor of Tanganyika Territory: As you are aware, this Government has been notified by the Portuguese Govern-ment of Mozambique that they do not intend to continue the present Mozambique convention [see B.ICR. Iv, p. 8], and notice of termination may be expected before next April. We- have agreed to a conference for a new convention for which they have asked. The Rand mines draw a large percentage of their native labourers from. Mozambique under the existing convention. The fact that Mozambique cannot afford, to send us so many labourers and that the local Mozambique industries should have priority over our mining requirements in the Transvaal is one of the ostensible reasons&apos; for the termination of the convention. We therefore run the risk either of losing this Mozambique labour (one corrupt group) for our mines or of having it seriously curtailed. The result for the gold mines will be disastrous in either case unless this loss of labour is made good from elsewhere to some extent. In order to ascertain, on health, and other grounds, whether such labour would be suitable for mining - labour on the Rand, I am anxious to make an experiment on a limited scale with labour recruited in Tanganyika Territory. The mining authorities believe they will be quite statable. I. wish to send for this purpose a couple,of officials to the Administrator at Dar-es-Salaam to discuss the whole question with him and to make arrangements with his approval for recruiting as a preliminary trial 5,000 natives for a 9 to 12 months&apos; engagement. These officials wall merely make a preliminary survey of tho field and discuss all relevant questions with the Administrator. The question of recruitment on a. larger, scale will be gone into only in case of the experimental shipment being authorized and proving a success. All 1 wish to know is whether I. have your permission to send officials to Tanganyika in order to discuss matters with Sir Horace Byatt, who could, after discussion, advise the Colonial. Office as to the policy to be adopted. I may point out that the development and prosperity of southern Mozambique and Delagoa Bay have been built up on the vast sums of wages which the Portguese boys annually take back from the Baud to Mozambique, and that if feasible on other grounds a large recruiting policy in Tanganyika wall have a very great effect in&apos; promoting its rapid economic development.It is essential, from the Empire and the Union point of view, that the working of the Rand mines, which are the greatest gold producers in the world, should not seriously suffer in case the Portuguese authorities decline ,to continue the present Mozambique recruiting. Many months must elapse before the preliminary arrangements for recruiting in Tanganyika can produce any result, and the Union -Government are anxious that investigations should not&quot; be deferred too much.Surveys for a New Port. In view of the uncertainty as to the renewal of the Mozambique convention, Government surveys are being carried out on the most complete scale by land and sea of Kosi Bay and Sibai Bay in the north of Zululaud, in order to gather exact data upon which the Government may come to a decision, firstly, whether a new harbour shall or shall not be created on the east coast, and secondly, as to precisely where the new port is to be located. Kosi Bay, if selected, would be linked up with the Piefc Retief line, thus providing a shorter route to the sea from many of the Natal coalfields, [lieuter, Capetown, 3rd November.]
8 *Distress among Farmers. -Owing to the financial depression and the consequent fall in values of agricultural produce, and also to the failure of the cereal crop, as a result of the drought conditions of last summer, many farmers are seriously involved financially, and may possibly he compelled to discontinue operations. The Government was recently strongly urged to render assistance, but was unable to accept various suggestions for remedying the position. Now, however, it proposes, with the approval of the banks, that the magistrates in the affected districts shall appoint vigilance committees, who shall endeavour to persuade creditors who are pressing for payment to grant debtor farmers an extension of time in which to discharge their liabilities. These committees are only, to intervene in cases where payment, or judicial execution would inflict irremediable loss on producers, and should their intervention fail the case is to be referred to the Government for further action. [Renter, Capetown, .13th October.]Johannesburg Municipal Elections. The municipal elections here resulted in the defeat of the labour party, which has consequently lost a majority on the town council. The council is now composed of 19 non-party members, 15 labour members, and.three nationalists. It is unlikely that a labour mayor will be elected. Among the new councillors is the Hon. Hugh Wyndham, an ex-member of the Legislative Assembly. - [Renter, Johannesburg, 27th October.]Settlers&apos; Association. All provinces were represented in the conference of the central executive of the 1820 settlers&apos; association, which met here to-day under the presidency of Brigadier-General Sir Charles Crewe. It was stated that the combined capital introduced by the 155 settlers, was 400.000Z., and that both the Dutch and English farmers were co-operating in advising the settlers so as to avoid mistakes and losses. An endeavour is being made to secure 5,000 members in the Cape and the Transvaal and so strengthen the association, and it has been decided to appoint farmers&apos; advisory boards in numerous towns in^the Cape. It was also resolved to send representatives to India to secure some officers who are retiring, as they are considered to be good settlers.   [Reuter, Durban, 25th October.]The Mining Position in Johannesburg. General Smuts, Prime Minister, and Mr. Malan, Minister of Mines, yesterday met a deputation of the South African Workers&apos; Union regarding the mining position in South Africa and the Gove,rnment&apos;s suggestions for effecting economy in the working of the mines by a more efficient use of the time of the native labourers under ground.The deputation emphatically protected that the suggested alterations would mean the abolition of the colour bar, lessen the number of white men employed and increase the accident and death rates. They added that the miners would strike in -18 hours if the amendments were gazetted. The miners realized the position of the low-grade mines, they said, and were willing to meet the Chamber of Mines and the Government in conference to consider ways and means of improving the efficiency of native labour on lines other than those suggested by the Government. [Reuter, Johannesburg, 5th November.]
