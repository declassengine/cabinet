On the 24th June, in the United Kingdom 2,170,219 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged, for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,626,435 were lodged by males and 543,784 by females. At the same date, 831,997 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 492,764 were lodged by males and 339,233 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 19,566 totally unemployed, and a decrease of 15,227 in those working short time.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Report on the Alexandria Riots.-On 6th July Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 451] that in the opinion of the military court of enquiry the cause of the trouble in Alexandria was that the mob had been led to suppose, by the demonstrations organized
by the followers-of Zagloul Pasha, that they could give vent to their fanatical hatred of Europe with impunity; such hatred having been fanned possibly by Kemalist propaganda, but certainly by the news of war between the Greeks and the Turks.A Nationalist Newspaper.  On 7th -July Lord Allenby reported [No. 455] that on 3rd July the newspaper Nizam, had published an open letter to Adly Pasha written by a certain Mohammed Gheita, of Beni-Suef, which contained the following passage:  *&apos; Egypt has a right to choose one of her loyal sons as her king.&quot; He added that this constituted an offence, under section 168 of the penal code ; that the Nizam had been suspended for six (? group omitted) by decision of the Council of Ministers ; and that Mohammed Gheita had been arrested and interned under martial law.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B E.R., xlvii, p. 5], The report received by the Viceroy, -and telegraphed [LI 6 S.] by him on 7th July, was to the effect that hostilities during the previous week had been confined to the Waziristan area south of Tochi, the principal incident having occurred near Palosina Jumna. Between 200 and 300 tribesmen had delivered an attack here, but had been repulsed with loss. Our casualties were reported to be:-Killed: 2 British officers, 14 Indian other ranks; wounded : 1 Indian officer, 35 Indian other ranks, Fighting on a small scale still continued.The Viceroyreport [1230], dated 14th -July, stated  that the situation, in Waziristan had been cptieter during the week ending 13th July.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xlvii, -p. 5j. On 4th July the Viceroy transmitted [1018 S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs following his report of 30th June. Sir Henry called attention to a certain aspect of the situation on which he thought the consideration of the Government of India would be desirable. He pointed out that the main principle by which the Afghans were actuated was that of equality with other nations, and independence of Indian tutelage. Direct dealings between their representative in Londou and the Foreign Office were held by them to be essential to the signing of any treaty, as they considered that they were now negotiating with His Majesty&apos;s Government, and not with the Government of India. In these circum-stances he believed that the appointment of an Indian moslem as the first British Minister would be regarded as a grave slight, He remained of opinion, therefore, that, at least, our first representative should be an European, who should have as First Secretary a carefully selected Indian moslem. Any tendency on the part of the Afghans to assert their independence by petty affronts to our representative could be countered by the intimation that their representatives in our territories would receive reciprocal treatment, which would extend to their Minister in London, whose treat-ment would be a matter of the highest concern to them.Commenting on the above, the A^iceroy said that the views of his Government remained unchanged, and that so long as no other European representatives were in Kabul, the appointment of a moslem representative at the outset would appear to be the wisest course.Replying [3404] on 7th July to the Viceroy, the Secretary of State said that while appreciating the considerations urged by the Viceroy, he felt strongly that under existing conditions, assuming the new treaty to be satisfactory, the British Minister at Kabul should be European, especially as other European representatives would probably be there in course of time, and it was desirable that the British representative should be first in the field..Referring to the conditions of the proposed treaty in which the gift of six aeroplanes was contemplated, the Secretary of State telegraphed [3412] on 8th July the views of the Air Council that every endeavour should be made to prevent the Afghan Air Force coming under any influence other than British, and the consequent necessity of the Afghan personnel being trained by unifs of the Royal Air-Force in India. &apos;With regard to another condition, the Secretary of State telegraphed [3420] on 8th July that His Majesty the King had approved of the title &quot;Your Majesty &quot; being conferred on the Amir on the conclusion of a satisfactory treaty.
In a telegram transmitted [1.066 S.] by the Viceroy on 11th duly, Sir Henry Dobbs referred to two of his letters of 1st July, which dealt respectively with (!) the various courses which the Afghans might adopt with regard to the negotiations ; and (2) suggestions for stopping passes should the negotiations end in rupture! The arrival in Kabul of Abdul Hadi from Bokhara, and the information about the Wana-Wazirs, When he was able to give it. would put the Afghans in possession of all our offers and conditions, and of first-hand information regarding the conditions obtaining in Central Asia. Sir Henry anticipated nevertheless that the Afghans would try to protract the negotiations, which might result in the production of all sorts of impossible conditions and the dissipation of the present friendly atmosphere. The-height of the hot weather having been passed, what the Afghans most dreaded was the prohibition of the cold weather immigration of powindahs and labourers to India. Delay until the middle of September would make it impossible to stop this, and we should lose a valuable weapon for impressing on Afghanistan her dependence on India.. Further clangers of delay were the secret ratification of the treaty with Russia involving Bolshevik support in money and arms ; the possibility of the Afghans changing their minds; and lastly, the expense, of maintaining regular troops at Wana until the conclusion of negotiations at Kabul. In view of these considerations, Sir Henry urged the forcing of an early decision, and begged to be authorized to inform the Afghans, if they showed signs of further delay, that he had instructions to leave Kabul unless they bad come to a decision by 1st August.In telegrams [1071 S.], [1071 S., part 2], dated 12th and 13th July, the Viceroy discussed Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; analysis of the various courses that the Afghans might adopt with regard to the negotiations. The Government of India agreed with Sir fleury that neither with safety nor with dignity could we allow the Afghans to protract proceedings indefinitely, and that if they showed a disposition, to do so, Sir-Henry should give them a definite time limit. In the event of the Afghaits rejecting our offer for an exclusive treaty the Government of India advocated reversion to the pis allay policy of a reduced offer, as preferable to no treaty at all.The Secretary of State sent [3563] a reply to the above on 16th July, in which he-referred to the difficulty of deciding the problem which now presented itself. lie considered, and thought the Viceroy would agree, that Sir Henry Dobbs could &quot;best judge whether there was more likelihood of obtaining an exclusive treaty by fixing a time limit immediately, or by allowing the Afghans a little more play. He approved of Sir Henry acting according to what he regarded the best course. The efforts of His Majesty&apos;s Government were directed towards securing an exclusive treaty, and only with great reluctance could they contemplate a reversion to the pis alter. He-would await the delinite assurance of the Government of India, that it was their considered opinion in all. the circumstances that the pig alter was better than no treaty at all, before putting the proposal before His Majesty&apos;s Government.The V;iceroy&apos;s Weekly Report. The following telegram was sent on 10th July :--Section!. Bombay.-The concluding stages of the campaign lor swaraj funds have met with marked success in Bombay, and the enthusiasm aroused will have ait heartening effect on the non-co-operators. The collection in Bombay is stated to be over 40 lakhs paid. Gandhi announced that the fund now exceeded one crore. At a. meeting of brokers, Gandhi exhorted the Bombay merchants to wear country made cloth, and said that Bombay, being the centre for the importation of foreign goods,, could put a stop to it if it made up its mind to do so. Attempts continue to rouse-moslem feeling over the Angora Governments position, and a meeting at Karachi urged civil disobedience and the prohibition of mohamedans assisting the Govern-nient should the British Government directly, or through the Greeks, attack the Angora Government. Important developments are expected at the All-India caliphate conference to be held at Karachi on 8th July. Picketting in connexion with the temperance movement has spread to Bombay city, but is unattended by violence,, though, in some cases, prosecutions on the complaint or at the instance of the police have been lodged.Bengal. The strikes in several branches of the steamer service have ended, but that on the Assam-Bengal railway continues. The employees of Howrah, Anita, and Barasat Bashirhat railway are on strike ; the British Indian Steam Navigation. Company strike has ended.-&apos;
Section 2. The non-co-operation movement shows no great progress, but the counter-propaganda in Barisal is reported successful.Section 3. At the trial, in Calcutta of Hakims Rahman, a caliphate worker, under section 124a, a crowd of mohamedans surrounded the court. The police, appre-hending trouble, look the necessary precautions, but there was -a slight disturbance in the streets.Section 1. A conspiracy for the escape of prisoners from Midnapur jail was frustrated.United Provinces. The break of the monsoon has distracted attention from, political movements, and TilalPs swaraj provincial subscriptions are not likely to come up to the expected amount. Non-co-operation is reported to be progressing poorly, while the anti-non-co-operation leagues are giving a good account of themselves. There are symptoms of an underground current of a somewhat menacing feeling among mohamedans observed as a result of complications with the Angora Govern-ment. The situation is being carefully watched. In regard to seditious utterances, warnings have been issued in seven cases, which include Abul Kalam Azad and Dr. Kitchlew ; six cases were actually instituted during June, but in- three of them the accused have been given an opportunity to recant.Section 5. Judgment has been pronounced in the libel suit by B. 0. Batliwala against the Independent newspaper ; 1 Syed Hussain, the editor, has been ordered to pay Rs. 7,500 as compensation.Section 6. The forest incendiarism in the Kumaon divisions, in the report of 0th June 1921, is now definitely traced to non-co-operators. Of 400,000 acres of forest, 250,000 have been burnt. The result is very serious, particularly in the resin area, where the yield is not likely to be one-quarter of last year&apos;s out-turn. The large population will lose the means of subsistence. It is difficult to trace the actual offenders, but 19 arrests have been made.Section 7. There was serious rioting at Aligarh on 5th July, and the troops were called out. The latest report is that all was quiet on the morning of the 7th instant.Section 8. Punjab. The split which has occurred in the central Gudwara committee has caused confusion amongst the extremists of Lahore and Amritsar. Though the central Gudwara committee is, in principle, committed to non-co-operation, they are in practice sitting on the fence and showing great, reluctance to carry out their principles. Sardul Singh, a Sikh extremist, has been convicted for seditious writing in Lahore, and sentenced to five years&apos; imprisonment. The conviction of one Autar Singh, sentenced to three years for seditious speech, has had a good effect on the Sikh situation in Rawalpindi. At a Sikh meeting at Hoshiapur, gratuitous insults were hurled at officials, irresponsible speeches made, and women and boys employed to affront Government, helpers. The lambardars of a Sikh village are reported to have refused to collect the land revenue and to have resigned their posts, but generally the collections are satisfactory. In the Jullundtir division a few villages wished to take the lead in the non-payment of revenue, but were dissuaded by the leading non-co-operators. Strenuous efforts are being made to collect subscriptions for TilalPs swaraj fund, but little enthusiasm is shown. The non-co-operation panchayats are showing signs of disintegration in one district, the members quarrelling and resorting to the ordinary courts. The non-co-operation organization is gaining ground, bnt anti-non-co-operatiou is also gaining force. A Jat-Sikh association recently broke up two non-co-operation meetings and captured a Gandhi flag. Abdul Kalam AzacPs recent manifesto regarding the attitude of mohamedans in the case of a renewal of hostilities between the British and Turkish Governments caused some stir in the moslem press. - ,Bihar and Orissa. A steady decline is reported in the non-co-operation movement and a slackening of activity. Quarrels are reported from several districts among the local leaders, the followers being thoroughly discontented, and the general public is beginning to view with dislike the features of the movement which at first appealed to them. This is due to more than one cause, the chief of which is the mohaniedau-(? hindu) tension on the question of cow sacrifice, and the alarm of the higher castes at the levelling tendency of the movement. Interference Avith liquor shops and pounds (sic) is rapidly disappearing. In one district the mohamedan leaders definitely decided not to co-operate with (? work of) the hindus. 30-3 B
Section 9. Considerable information pointing to misappropriation of funds is coming in. The provincial leaders claim to have collected Rs. 162,000 for the swaraj fund; but only Rs. 93,000 have actually been received by the provincial committee. The pauchayats and seva samitis are growing increasingly unpopular. In the Tirhut division there are signs of a general disinclination to pay the chaukidari tax ; and steps are being taken to enforce payment if necessary. Attempts to stimulate the caliphate agitation by giving it an independent organization apart from the congress, had been unsuccessful.Burma. In connexion with the assault on a European engineer by Indian mohamedans attending the funeral of Prince Jamshed Bakht, disorderly crowds assembled in the vicinity of the court, owing to the arrest of some volunteers, but the crowds were dispersed without difficulty. Seven volunteers had been sent up for trial in connexion with the assault, Four were convicted and two warned and discharged on promising to be of good behaviour.Section &quot;10. The Rangoon caliphate committee is reported lobe split into two factions. The vernacular press continues hostile to dyarchy, but plenty of the leaders declare that Burma as a whole will accept it, and that the non-co-operation movement will not make headway.Section 11. There is a strike of the Mandalay Tramway Company&apos;s employees, and precautions have been taken by the police to prevent intimidation.Section 12. The price of rice is very high, and if a further rise occurs owing to speculation, an unfavourable reaction on the political situation may occur.  .Section 13. Central Provinces. Non-co-operating energies are wholly absorbed in collecting subscriptions for the swaraj fund and enlisting members for the congress. The collections are reported to be disappointing. Dr. Gholkar has been discharged by the magistrate in.the case under section 124a, brought against him.Section 14. The procedure to be followed by non-co-operators when put on trial is causing a split in the extremist camp, as one section stigmatizes the policy of &quot;no defence &quot; as absurd.Assam. Although there has been no repetition of the exodus of the coolies, the labour force on the tea gardens continues to cause anxiety ; an organized campaign appears to be in existence throughout the tea districts to interfere with the food supplies of the labour force on European gardens. A conviction has been obtained in one case -where rice was seized by non-co-operators on its way to a garden, but the more usual line of action is persuasion of. the, villagers not to sell to coolies on the European gardens and not to bring in supplies to the markets. The strike on the Assam-Bengal railway continues. Non-co-operators are concentrating on Stirling up labour troubles, and little propaganda work is in progress. There is little doubt that, under colour of preaching temperance, their agents are actually disseminating ill-will towards the Government and Europeans, both among the villagers and the coolies. The European planters arc urging a more decided line of action to be taken against them. The local Government are enforcing the ordinary law wherever necessary, and are also instituting counter-propaganda. The institution known as the &quot;&apos; Gandhi Bhok,&quot; entailing a weekly fast on Wednesday, is reported to have spread among the Gurkhali residents in the Naga Hills, and some sepoys of the Naga Hills battalion have begun to observe it.NQrtli-West Frontier Province, The political situation is generally satisfactory.Section 15. The central caliphate committee proposed sending a commission to Bannu, to enquire into the punitive action recently taken against certain British villages, but the commission has not yet arrived. The local congress committee in Peshawar resolved that in case of war against Angora Indians should refrain from helping the Government.Section 16. Delhi. The attention of political extremists is concentrated exclusively on the election of representatives to the district congress council, which is locally described as the national parliament. The establishment of a parallel system of administration, an intensive social boycott of loyalists, police and an army, and the refusal to pay taxes, are frankly explained as the objectives of the congress organization.. General. More than one province has reported a decline in political activity as the result of the monsoon, having broken. But Gandhi s subsequent and somewhat unexpected claim to have succeeded in collecting one crore of rupees by the end of
June is likely to increase his prestige and influence, and may lead to fresh develop-ments of his policy. He is now actively organizing a boycott of foreign cloth&apos;in Bombay, which is causing grave anxiety to the wholesale piece-goods merchants. The caliphate leaders will probably urge him to take an extreme line, including the adoption of civil disobedience and. the non-payment of taxes and possibly even the declaration of an Indian republic. We do not anticipate that he will make any announcement till after the meeting of the All-India congress committee at Lucknow on 22nd J uly.Fiscal Autonomy. The following despatch was sent to the Secretary of State for India on. 2.1st April 1921, being signed by the Viceroy, Sir William Vincent, K.C.S.L, Mr. W. M; Hailey, Sir Thomas Holland, K.O.S.I., and Mr. B. N. Sarma :-We have the honour to report for your information that a resolution -was passed in the Council of State on the 23rd February last in the following terms : &quot;This Council recommends to the, Governor-General in Council that His Majesty&apos;s Government be addressed through the Secretary of State with a prayer that the Government of India be granted full fiscal autonomy subject to the provisions of the Government of India Act.&quot;2. The last 10 words of this resolution, were substituted on, the motion of our late colleague Sir George Barnes for the words &quot;under the direction of the Indian Legislature&quot; which appeared in the resolution as moved by the Honourable. Mr. Lalubhai Sairialclas. We were unable to accept the resolution, in. its original form as it proposed that in fiscal matters the Government of India should be subject only, to the control of the Indian Legislature. We regarded this proposal as being incon-sistent with the provisions of the Government of India Act. The resolution as amended indicates the agreement of the Council of State with the views expressed on the subject of fiscal autonomy by the joint select committee in its remarks on clause 33 of the Government of India Bill. The joint committee pointed out that fiscal autonomy could not be guaranteed to India by statute without limiting the ultimate power of Parliament to control the administration of India and. without limiting the power of veto which vests in the Crown. It took the view that fiscal autonomy could be assured to India only by the acknowledgment of a convention, and it expressed the opinion that, in order that a convention of this kind might grow up, the Secretary of State should, as far as possible, avoid interference when the Govern-ment of India and the Legislature were in agreement, and that his intervention, when it did take place, should be limited to safeguarding the international, obligations of the. Empire or any fiscal, arrangements within the Empire to which His Majesty&apos;s Government was a party.3. We request that the resolution may be hud before His Majesfy&apos;s Government.The following reply was sent by Mr. Montagu on 30th June :-I have received and noted on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government (lie despatch&apos; of your Excellency&apos;s Government, No. Hi (Department of Commerce), dated. 21st April 1921, which communicated the resolution passed in the Council of State on 23rd February 1921, recommending that His Majesty&apos;s Government, should be addressed with a prayer that the Government of India be granted full fiscal autonomy subject to the provisions of the Government of India Act.2. In this connexion I would refer to my reply to the deputation from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, received at the India Office on 10th March 1.921, forwarded with my Despatch No. 44 (Revenue), dated the 21st April 1921, from which it will appear that I have, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, accepted the principle recommended by the Joint Committee in their report on clause 33 of the Government of India Bill.The following are the remarks on clause 3)3 of the Government of India Bill made by the joint select committee and referred to above : The committee have given most careful consideration to the relations of the Secretary of State with the Government of India, and through, it with the provincial Governments. In the relations of the Secretary of State with the Governor-General in Council, the committee are not of opinion, that any statutory change.can be made so long as the Governor-General remains responsible to Parliament, but in practice the conventions which now govern these relations may wisely be modified to meet fresh circumstances caused by the creation of a Legislative Assembly with a. large elected majority. In the exercise of his responsibility to Parliament, which he cannot 30-3 O
delegate to. anypne else, the Secretary of State may reasonably consider that only in exceptional circumstances should he be called upon to intervene in matters of purely Indian interest where the Government.and the Legislature of India are in agreement.This examination of the general proposition leads inevitably to the consideration of one special case of non-intervention. Nothing is more likely to endanger the good relations between India and Great Britain than a belief that India s fiscal policy is dictated from. Whitehall in the interests of the trade of Great&apos; Britain. That such a belief exists at the moment there can be no doubt.. That there ought to be no room for it in the future is equally clear. India&apos;s position in the Imperial Conference opened the door to negotiation between India and the rest of the Empire, but negotiation without power to legislate is likely to remain ineffective. A satis-factory solution of the question can only be guaranteed by the grant of liberty to the Government of India to devise those tariff arrangements which seem best fitted to India&apos;s needs as an integral portion of the British Empire. It cannot be guaranteed by statute without limiting the ultimate power&quot;of.Parliament to control the administration of India, and without limiting the power of veto which rests in the Crown ; and neither of these limitations finds a place in any of the statutes in the British Empire. It can only therefore be assured by an acknowledgment of a convention. Whatever be the right fiscal policy for India, for the needs of her consumers as well as for her manufacturers, it is quite clear that she should have the same liberty to consider her interests as Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. In the opinion of&quot; the committee, therefore, the Secretary of State should as far as possible avoid interference on this subject when the Government of India and its Legislature are in agreement, and they think that his intervention, when it does take place, should be limited to safeguarding the inter-national obligations of the Empire or any fiscal arrangements within the Empire to which Bis Majesty&apos;s Government is a party.THE DOMINIONS.AUSTRALIA;Proposed Visit of H.M.A.S. Melbourne to the New Hebrides, die.-The Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follow on. the 14th July :--The Government of the Commonwealth propose that PI.M.A.S. Melbourne should visit the ports in the New Hebrides and New Caledonia between approximately the 18th and 28th September, coaling at Noumea from commercial stocks about 24th September, and desire that the usual intimation may be given to the Government of France with regard to the visit to New Caledonia, and that the Government of the Commonwealth may be informed whether there is any objection. If, in accordance with previous practice, it is also asked that the Government of France may be informed of the proposed visit to the New Hebrides, I presume that you will, advise the Admiralty as well as the Foreign Office.The Acting High Commissioner for Australia has received the following advices by cable from the Prime Ministers department, Melbourne : Wool Sales. The new year for wool sales in Australia has opened with auctions at Melbourne, Sydney, and Geelong. The results all round show an easier tendency both in competition and in prices, though the finest wools again secured satisfactory rates, reaching as high as&apos; 27$d. in Sydney, where the market conditions generally are better than in the south. Japan is still foremost in demand, though continental, agents are fairly acti ve. It is clear, however, that the strength displayed at the May and June sales has weakened similarly with that of the British market. The statistics of the past year reveal that abnormal difficulties have been experienced. The total of, the disposals was comparatively heavy, but the wisdom of the stabilization policy and the extent of the periodical allotments are seen to be justified.Wools for August Sales. Sir John Higgins, chairman of Bawra, announces that the amount of wool to be submitted at the August auction sales was considered on 13th July at a conference between the Australian Board of Bawra and the executive
of the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers of Australia. It was agreed that the quantity for August should be 150,000 bales, exclusive of 54,000 bales of passed-in wools from previous auctions, which, with fell-mongered wools, make a total catalogue available for auction and private treaty of approximately 200,000 bales. The conference further decided to allocate to the September auctions 75,000 bales, but this decision is subject to review about the middle of August.Air Mails between the Capitals. The Federal Cabinet has agreed to the early establishment of aerial mail services between Adelaide and Sydney, and Sydney and Brisbane. The routes cover 1,200 miles, making a total of 2,200 miles of aerial mail routes in Australia.New Tariff. The Tariff. Board&apos;s Bill has passed through all stages in the House of Representatives. It has been amended to provide that the refusal of a manufacturer to sell to any person goods&apos; to the value of 501. at current market rates shall be referred to the Board; the object being to encourage the elimination of the large middlemen by compelling manufacturers to sell small quantities of goods to small retailers.NEW ZEALAND.Naval Prize [B.E.R., xlvii, p. 10].-On 12th duly the Governor-General, referring to the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 30th June, informed him that his Government was not concerned, as no naval prize matters had arisen in that Dominion.SOUTH AFRICA.Prorogation of Parliament. A message from the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 14th July, states that Parliament had been prorogued that day.The following three items were telegraphed by ReuteFs Capetown corrrespon-dent on 14th, 9th and 12th July respectively : -(1) Bills rejected by the Senate.-The Senate has rejected the Wages Bill and the Apprenticeship Bill, which were both strongly supported by the Labour party in the Union House of Assembly.(2) Customs. Mr. Malan, acting Prime Minister, has appointed a Board of Trade and. Industries with a strong personnel, which includes Sir Eclmond Gorges, to hear and. examine complaints and recommendations,made as to the working of the Customs and Excise tariffs, and to advise the Government as regards (1) the recasting of the Customs tariffs and the adjustment of anomalies ; (2) such action as may be necessary or advisable for assisting and developing the industries of the Union; and (3) such other matters as the Government may refer to the Board.(3) Railway Deficit. Dealing with the subject of railway finances in a speech here to-day Mr. dagger, Union Minister of Railways and Harbours, stated that, despite economies, the first two months of the financial year showed a shortage of 363.000L The most serious feature, he said, was the steady fall in revenue.Miners&apos;&apos; Wages. On 8th July ReuteFs Johannesburg correspondent reported that in a conference with delegates from the trade unions the Chamber of Mines had withdrawn the claim for a reduction of 3s. a day in the wages of men employed in or about the mines and had agreed to submit moderated proposals for consideration by the joint executive of trade unions.
