The decision of the Ebbw Vale miners to resume work ends the last of the important coal-mining disputes arising out of the recent national settlement. Once again, therefore, the most acute problem in the coal-mining industry is unemployment, and there are signs that the miners&apos; unions wish to put into operation the special unemployment fund scheme which had been prepared and approved just before the opening of the recent dispute. -The settlement of the series of local coal disputes also means that the shipyard joiners&apos; strike is restored to its position as the most important dispute, numerically, in progress. &apos;!The general movement towards wages reductions over large groups of occupations continues. The most important events in the past week of this nature have been in connection with the printers, but the movement is now being definitely extended, to wholesale distributive occupations in London, and to co-operative employees generally. A revision of the wages and conditions of road transport workers is taking place all over the country.The Unemployment Position. On the 8th July, in the United Kingdom 2,123,636 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance vYcts, and&apos; out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,619,995 were lodged by males and 503,641 by females. At the same date, 887,246 unemploy-ment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 466,303 were lodged by males and 420,943 by females.These figures show a decrease on the previous week of 46,259 totally unemployed and 107,730 working short time. . -On the 15th July, in the United Kingdom 2,007,254 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,555,340 were lodged by males and 451,914 by females. At the same date, 760,170 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 391,448 were lodged by males and 368,722 by females.These figures show a decrease on the previous week of 116,382 totally unemployed and 127,076 working short time.,*&quot;
COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.False Rumours. On 27th July Lord Allenby reported [No. 493] that a report had reached the palace from Paris that negotiations with the official delegation had broken down, and asked whether he might reassure the Sultan.On the same day Lord Curzon replied [No. 394] that there was no truth in the report, and that the Sultan should be so informed.PALESTINE.The Mission to England and the Pope. On 28th July Count de Salis telegraphed [No. 25] from Rome as follows : -The Cardinal Secretary of State informed Mr. Dormer to-day that the Palestine mission, which is on its way to England, had called on him. On his enquiring as to the object of their visit they began by referring to the position of the Arabs. The Cardinal cut them short and said that this question lay outside the (? reach) of the Vatican, but that with regard to the interests of the Catholic Church in Palestine the case was different. He drew their attention to the Pope&apos;s allocution in which His Holiness had urged that our mandate should be examined by the League of Nations in order to see that the Jews were not given an unduly preponderant position. They declared that the allocution had not been allowed publication in Palestine although they had seen it in the Egyptian press. They asked for an audience of the Pope. The Cardinal Secretary of State replied that His Holiness was very busy, and that it could only be arranged on condition that it should be brief, that they should not go outside the range of the allocution, and that nothing should be published. They agreed and the Pope received them for a few minutes in the afternoon.The Cardinal said that the mission consisted of three Arabs and two Christians, only one of whom could speak French.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., [xlviii, p. 3], According to the reports received by the Viceroy and telegraphed [1289] by him on 20th July, there had been an increase of enemy activity in Waziristan since his last message. The enemy, who had established themselves on /both sides of the narrow gorge at Shahur Tangi, had attacked a convoy on its way from Chagmalai to Haidarir Each. The convoy had retired under cover of fighting troops sent out from Chagmalai, who, after an hour and a half &apos;s fighting, forced the enemy to retire. There was no loss of rifles or stores, but the following casualties were reported : Killed : 2 British officers, 2 British other ranks, 1 Sub-Assistant Surgeon, 13 Indian other ranks. Wounded : 1 British officer, 1 British other ranks, 1 Indian officer, 14 Indian other ranks.Telegraphing [1346] on 27th July the Viceroy reported that beyond a skirmish in the Tochi district, in which we had five wounded and the enemy greater casualties, nothing of importance had occurred in the remainder of Waziristan.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xlviii, p. 3].-The Viceroy transmitted [1785 S.] on .21st July a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs, reporting several conferences between the Amirs of Afghanistan and Bokhara, and suggesting that the Afghan delay might possibly be due to the desire of the former to obtain from the Amir of Bokhara a definite pledge of subordination to and co-operation with Afghan policy before he concluded an arrangement with us.In-a telegram [177$ S.] dated 22nd July the Viceroy recorded the comments with which the Government of India.had accompanied the repetition of the Secretary -of State&apos;s telegram of 16th July to Sir Henry Dobbs. The Government were not able to accept Sir tienry s proposal to give the Afghans grace until 1st August, and to follow rejection of our offers by closing the passes against the annual Powindah
immigration. The difficulties in effectively checking their movement could only be overcome by the exercise of force at many points of the frontier.- - After reviewing the proposal from every aspect, the Government of India had come to the conclusion that the closing of the passes must be ruled out.It seemed preferable that the placing of a time limit should come from the Afghans themselves, and it was suggested to Sir Henry that he might take .up an attitude which would induce this result.Sir Heniy was then informed that the Government of India were again addressing the Secretary of State regarding the reversion to the pis alter as a last resort. They were convinced that, while an exclusive treaty was our paramount aim, the pis alter treaty would be better than none at all. Should the Afghans reject the exclusive treaty, the next best thiug would be for them to make a move towards the pis alter solution. It was only as an eleventh-hour effort, and after failure to induce the Afghans to make this move, that the Government of India contemplated its introduction by Sir Henry himself. Nevertheless, the Viceroy stated, it was the considered opinion of the Govern ment that a treaty even on these lines would be much better than no treaty at all.On 22nd July the Viceroy transmitted [1780 S.] a message from Sir Henry Dobbs reporting a meeting with the Afghan representatives on 14th July. Tarsi had then said that the Council bad further discussed the British proposals, and had decided that the exchange of views regarding future agreements with third parties affecting mutual interests could not be promised, and that was now the main objection. Sir Henry bad adduced all his previous arguments on this matter, and had withdrawn after expressing the hope that the Afghans would be able to find a suitable formula. He had followed this up by an official letter confirming his verbal statements, and laying it down that provision for previous discussion of contemplated agreements with third parties affecting mutual interests was a sine qua non. Sir Henry had hopes that the Afghans might yield on this point, but thought it might become necessary to threaten his departure before they did so. He believed that, in raising this objection, the object of the Afghans was to gain time pending the development of the Anatolian situation. Tarsi had stated, in the course of discussion, that Afghanistan did not consider herself sufficiently advanced to- join the League of Nations, and had consequently decided not to apply for admission.In commenting on the above, the Viceroy remarked that the crux of the whole problem lay in whether the Afghans were in earnest or not.The Secretary of State, replying [No. 3793] to the Viceroy&apos;s telegrams on 27th July, agreed that the crux of the problem was the earnestness or otherwise of the Afghans, on which Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; last report created serious doubt. After reviewing the various arguments, he gave his view that, for the purposes of the exclusive treaty, they should adhere to Sir Henry&apos;s sine qua non policy regarding previous discussion of contemplated agreements with third parties. The general question of reversion to pis alter must depend on the manner and attendant circum-stances of the rejection of our larger offer. The Secretary of State proposed not to submit the pis alter, which was much disliked by His Majesty&apos;s Government, unless and until the choice lay definitely between that and nothing. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would then be guided in their decision by the actual circumstances. The eleventh-hour policy of Sir Henry Dobbs himself proposing reversion to pis alter was not desirable-.The Viceroy&apos;s Report. The following telegram was sent on 27th July:- Section ]. Madras. The movement in Trrchinopoly to uplift the Paranyas is reported to be assuming a more dangerous aspect, and the boycott of cases of Paranyas by caste people continues.Section 2. Incitements to violence and several cases of assault have been reported in connexion with the Buckingham mills strike. Some workmen were induced to continue working, but a collision is feared between them and the strikers. Action against the leader of the strike is being considered. The mill strikers attacked the houses of Anglo-Indians in the vicinity of the disturbed area, but were dispersed. The Governor visited the locality on the 5th instant. The latest news shows that a number.of workmen returned to work at the Buckingham and the Carnatic mills. The approaches to the mills are guarded by the police. The Governor received a deputation on the 7th and discussed the possibility of arriving at a settlement.Bombay.-The Ali brothers and Kitchlew visited Poona and Gokak (Belgaum district), where Kitchlew made objectionable speeches which are being examined.
Mohamed Ali said bat little, but mentioned that the question coming to the love was the emptying of the police barracks. He did not anticipate much difficulty in winning over the military. Gandhi said in Young India that the apology given by the Ali brothers was instigated by him; it was not made to evade prosecution but to right the Ali brothers with their own consciences and their friends, and that the Govern-ment were free to prosecute the brothers whenever they chose in connexion with the prohibition of the meeting of city congress committee, Lahore. Ho wrote that it was evident that the officials were challenging and provoking non-co-operators to civil disobedience ; a few more such orders and he promised that the challenge would be heartily taken up. An informal conference was held between Gandhi and the&apos;whole-sale piece-goods merchants, when Gandhi gave the merchants two months to clear their stock of foreign cloth and cancel orders, warning them that their shops would be picketed if they did not comply. All the merchants agree that the movement will give a great impetus to, local mill-made goods. Gandhi has issued an appeal to the millowners to help the country by not raising prices. The. Bombay provincial congress committee has arranged to collect foreign cloth wearing apparel and destroy it in a bonfire on 1st August. A committee has been appointed to manage the local Tilak swaraj funds, which are to be restricted to the spread of charkas, the conduct of national schools, the elevation of the depressed classes, famine relief, and liquor prohibition.Section 3.  The All-India caliphate conference at Karachi, though much advertised, \vas,poorly attended and excited little local interest.Section 4. The All-India caliphate conference at Karachi passed resolutions including a declaration of allegiance to Turkey, a decision to send emissaries to other Moslem countries to promote Islamic brotherhood, congratulations to the Kemalists on their efforts to save Islam and drive foreigners out of Turkish territory, and the reiteration of the previous decision to start civil disobedience if Britain declared war against Angora. In that case Indian Moslems would establish complete independence at the Christmas session of the Indian national congress at Ahmedabad, and hoist the national flag of the Indian republic. Service in the British.army was declared to be sinful for all Moslems. Mohamed Ali made a long speech chiefly connected with his apology to the Government; he reiterated his old statements, said they could never apologize to the Government, and speaking of the interview between the Viceroy and Gandhi, said that if the Viceroy did not agree to a joint announcement Gandhi would issue a separate one, adding that people would sooner believe Gandhi than the Viceroy. The Bombay congress committee stopped the picketing of liquor shops in order to give the shopkeepers an opportunity to press the Government to refund the licence -fees.   Disorder is reported from Matiari in the Hyderabad district, Sind.Section 5.   Bengal. The excitement over the coolies exodus is dying down, but unrest is reported amongst the coolies in the tea gardens of Darjiling and Dooars.Section 6.   The resolution in the Legislative Council for the appointment of a commission of encpury into the Chandpur incident was defeated ; but in the debate on the resolution requesting local officers to prevent the recurrence of such incidents^ there was much bitter recrimination against officials.Section 7. The attempt made to excite the coolies in the tea. gardens of Chittagong has hitherto been unsuccessful. An attempt has been made in the Tharawadi division to control supplies by the formation of village unions, to prohibit the exportation of rice, corn, and jute, and to sell to&apos; non-Indian customers only at exorbitant rates, the object being to injure European interests and to secure some control over the merchant classes.Section S. The local Government has issued a circular in Eastern Bengal pointing out the folly and futility of strikes, which have increased the cost of living.Section 9. There are signs of reaction against non-co-operation. Picketing and forcible acts in connexion with the temperance movement are abating.Section 10. At a meeting at Calcutta it was disclosed that of the Rs. 2,50,000 realized from the sale of caliphate notes, only Rs. 26,000 had been sent to the committee at Bombay, and Rs. 5,500 held in deposit in Calcutta. The balance had been mi  appropriated.Section 11. The report of the C.I.D. shows that the revolutionaries released under the amnesty are taking advantage of non-co-operation to strengthen their organizations. Many released detenus are still irreconcilable, and may be waiting an 31-1 B
gopportunity to start the campaign afresh. On the other hand many are known to be working earnestly for reforms.Section 1.2. The strike on the Assam-Bengal railway continues, but passenger traffic has been resumed.Section 13. Seven new volunteer corps have been established in Faridpur, making 32 for the whole province. These are particularly active in three districts in enforcing the boycott of the courts and liquor shops and in carrying on village propaganda. The success of the anti-non-co-operation propaganda is distinctly, encouraging, it is evident that there are still strong local elements opposed to non-co-operation and unlawful acts. The caliphate worker mentioned in the last report and two non-co-operation workers have been sentenced, two to 18 months&apos; and oue to a year&apos;s rigorous imprisonment under section 124a. The conspiracy to escape from Midnapur jail proved to be due to ideas prevalent regarding Gandhi and his propaganda. The prisoners were led to believe that the day of the British raj -was over. The Calcutta piece-goods merchants are showing a feeling of uncertainty in regard &quot;to the boycott of foreign cloth, but the general opinion is that the movement is bound to fail in view of the inability of the Indian mills to supply the country&apos;s needs, and important Indian interests are involved in the import trade.Section 14. United Provinces.-At Aiigarh many arrests have been made. S. A. Sherwani, barrister, was arrested on the 19th, brought to trial and sentenced at once to a year&apos;s rigorous imprisonment under section 153a, Indian Penal Code. Pandit Moti Lai Nehru has been served with a notice under section 144, Criminal Procedure Code.Section 15. Punjab.--There, has been little development in the Sikh situation. At the re-election of the committee next month the extremist Sikhs hope to secure strong non-co-operation members, but success is by no means assured. The non-co-operators are jubilant over gandhis success in raising a crore of rupees. In the Jullundur division the non-co-operation panchayats continue to show signs of dissension.Section 16. Burma. A Burmese buddhist monk, K. Oktaoa, has been seutenced under section 124a to 10 mouths&apos; simple imprisonment for each of two speeches, the sentences running consecutively. Plartal was reported on the 11th to be very extensive ; most Indian and Burmese shops were closed and vehicular traffic was suspended, but there was no disturbance. Burmese ladies at a meeting resolved to support the non-co-operation boycott of British goods as a protest against Oktaoa&apos;s conviction.Section 17. Bihar and Orissa. The improvement in the political situation continues. Panchayat is becoming generally unpopular. The picketing of liquor shops is ceasing, and several cases of illicit distilling have been detected. The boycotting of foreign goods is not making much progress.Section 18. The provincial, congress committee discussed resolutions (a) that civil disobedience should start from 1st August; (6) that the volunteers should be organized and given military training, and (c) that provision should be made for the families of non-co-operators sent to jail. The first was strongly opposed, and may lead to a split, second and third were adopted.Section 19. The split between the hindus and the mohamedans continues, but GandbFs instructions are becoming known that the hindus are not to interfere with cow-killing.   The industrial situation remains quiet.Central Provinces. The situation has greatly improved. There has been a lull in political activity, chiefly due to agricultural operations being in progress. The suspension of the land, revenues, the distribution of agricultural loans and relief works, have convinced people that the Government is their best friend and not the non-co-operators, who have done nothing for them.In the towns the improvement is attributed to the prosecutions, which have been most useful against, picketing. Several non-co-operator leaders have resumed practice. The arbitration courts have expired. The charka movement is considered a failure. Attendance at colleges and&apos; schools is becoming normal. The local Government find it difficult to.judge whether the improvement is permanent or temporary, but much depends on the monsoon, which if &quot;goodwill (omission) unrest.Assam. The situation is improving; there has been little activity on the part of non-co-operators.   There have been no further strikes in the tea gardens.
Section 20. The strike on the Assam-Bengal railway continues, but more trains are running.&apos; Two minor strikes have been reported for an increase of wages ; one of coolies at Dibrugarh Ghat, and the other at the Assam sawmill company&apos;s works. Both have been settled. . &quot;Section 21. North-West Frontier Province. The central caliphate committee&apos;s visit to Bannu has been stopped under the-Defence of India Rules. The situation in Bannu has much improved. Some efforts have been reported from flazara and Peshawar to revive the agitation amongst the Sikhs.- Delhi. The immediate political future is bound up with the establishment of improved economic&apos;conditions. Meetings continue to be held, and one objectionable feature was the hustling of the C.I.D. reporters. Steps have been taken to curb violent speakers.The majority of piece goodsdealers are convinced of the ultimate failure of the boycott campaign against foreign cloth.General. The situation is distinctly better. There exists considerable doubt amongst a large number of people in regard to the success of Ganclhi&apos;s policy of boycotting foreign cloth. We have asked the local Governments to take active counter-measures, especially vigorous prosecutions for offences committed by picketing parties.The decision regarding civil disobedience will probably be reached at the meeting of the congress committee on 28th July. The venue has been shifted from Lucknow to Bombay, where Gandhi considers his presence indispensable for (corrupt group). Declarations by the extremist caliphate leaders against service in the army, and the police are becoming more frequent. We are considering the possibility of prosecutions.Section 22. Calcutta. The bar oppose the proposal to constitute a court of ultimate appeal in India, on the ground that people would not have as much confidence in it as in the Privy Council. The recommendations of the Press Act committee are generally approved by both the Indian and European press. The only point considered necessary is the printing of the eclitor&apos;s name on the front page of the paper.   A committee on repressive laws is now sitting in Simla.THE DOMINIONS.Date fixed for the End of the War. On 25th July the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and to the Governor of Newfoundland: It is proposed to issue an Order in Council under the Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act, 1918, ordering that 1st September 1921 shall be treated as the date of the termination of the present war; a paragraph being, added stating that nothing in the Order shall affect the relations between His Majesty and any State with which His Majesty still continues to be at war until the ratifications of a treaty of peace with that State shall have been exchanged or deposited,.AUSTRALIA.The following items of information were received by the acting High Commis-sioner on 18th and 27th July : New Commonwealth Loan. The Federal Treasurer, Sir Joseph Cook, is launching another peace loan, called the &quot; Diggers&apos; Loan,&quot; of 10 millions sterling, bearing 6 per cent, interest. Price of issue -96. . Date of maturity, December 1930.. The money to be used almost wholly for the soldier-settlement scheme and the building of war service homes. The banks have agreed to advance 5 per cent, per annum up to 86 per cent, oft the amount of application by clients who may wish to take stock with repayments, wlaere desired, spread over 18 months. The &quot; Diggers&apos; Loan&quot; is regarded as the most attractive yet offered in the Commonwealth.New Tariff.--The Tariff Board&apos;s Bill has passed through all stages in the House of Representatives.   It has been amended to provide that the refusal of a manu-facturer to sell to any person goods to the value of 501. at current market rates shall 31-1 C
be referred to the Board, the object being to encourage the elimination of the large middlemen by compelling manufacturers to sell small quantities of goods to small retailers.WooZ Sales.-(1) 18th July. The new year for wool sales in Australia has opened with auctions at Melbourne, Sydney and Geelong. The results all round show an easier tendency both in competition and in prices, though the finest wools again secured satisfactory rates, reaching as higlras 27  pence in Sydney, where the market conditions generally are better than in the south. Japan is still foremost in demand, though continental agents are fairly active. It is clear, however, that the strength displayed at the May and June sales has weakened similarly with that of the British market. The statistics of the past year; reveal that abnormal difficulties have been experienced. Total disposals were comparatively heavy, but the wisdom of the stabilization policy, and the extent of the periodical allotments, are seen to be justified.(2) 27t/i July. Thirty thousand hales of wool are loading in Australia for oversea ports. Current wool sales in Melbourne and Sydney show improved strength. Japanese and continental agents are still keen. Yorkshire agents are apathetic.Wools for August Sales. Sir John Higgins, chairman of Bawra, announces that the amount of wool to be submitted at the August auction sales was considered on 13th July at a conference between the Australian Board of Bawra and the executive of the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers of Australia. It was agreed that the quantity for August should be 150,000 bales, exclusive of 54,000 bales of passed-in wools from previous auctions, which, with fellmongered wools, make a total catalogue available for auction and private treaty of approximately 200,000 bales. The conference further decided to allocate to the September auctions 75,000 bales, but this decision is subject to review about the middle of August.WooZ Profits. The chairman of the central wool committee, Sir John Higgins, has issued a statement re the distribution of Australian wool profits. On behalf of the Commonwealth Government, the committee will distribute priority Bawra wool certificates representing at face values 22 million sterling, all profit. Of 10 million -sterling priority certificates, Bawra has decided to retire 47 &quot;5 per cent., equal to 4,750,000Z. This, with other sums, gives a total cash distribution of 5,005,OO0Z. As indicating the magnitude of the work performed by the central wool committee since its appointment in November 1916, Sir John Higgins quotes the following figures :  Bales of wool appraised numbered 7,154,621. Total weight, 2,486,721,753 lbs.Total appraised value, I60,600,780Z, /In addition, growers have received in.the first distribution 5 per cent, on the appraised value, and were paid in cash in October last year 7,653,O00Z., while a second distribu-tion of 22,00.0,000 Bawra. shares wool certificates and cash is now about to be made. This brings the total financial result of the Bawra venture to 190,253,780Z.Air Mails between Capitals. The Federal Cabinet has agreed to the early establishment of aerial mail services between Adelaide and. Sydney, and Sydney and Brisbane. The routes cover 1,200 miles, making a total of 2,200 miles of aerial mail routes in Australia.Wheat for London. The Australian wheat board has received London orders of 2,000 tons flour additional to the orders expected.I v SOUTH AFRICA.Tariff Question-Renters agent telegraphed as follows from Capetown on 26th July:-In a speech addressed to the fifth convention of the Federated Chamber of Industries at Port Elizabeth, Mr. Malan, who is acting as Prime Minister pending the absence of General Smuts, made a reference to the Board of Trade and Industries, which, it was announced earlier in the month, has been appointed &quot;&quot;to hear and examine complaints and recommendations made as to the working of the customs and excise tariffs, and to advise the Government as regards the recasting of the tariff and the assistance of industries.&quot;
Mr. Malan explained that the Government did not intend to create a &quot;protective board &quot; only to deal with tariffs. The board would inquire into conditions, and if an industry were found to be hampered or struggling, and if it were believed that under certain conditions it would succeed, the board would consider whether it was worth while to create these conditions.Proposed Reduction of Wages. Telegraphing from Johannesburg on 21st July Reuter&apos;8 agent reported as follows : (1) The Chamber of Mines has notified the South African Industrial Federation of its intention to reduce wages in the mines by Is. (xL per shift as from 1st August next.On 9th June, the joint-executive of the trades unions endorsed the resolution of the conference of trades unions of 6th June to the effect that there was no justification for the Chamber of Mines&apos; proposal to reduce wages by 18s. per week.- On 8th July the Chamber of Mines withdrew their claim for a reduction of 3s. daily, and agreed to submit moderated proposals.(2) The combined executives of the trade unions of the mining industry have decided to take a ballot throughout the whole of the industry on the question whether the ultimatum of the Chamber of Mines regarding a reduction of wages by Is. Qd. per shift from 1st August next should be resisted.. (3) The ballot paper on the subject of wages which has been issued by the combined executives of the trade unions of the mining industry asks whether the men are prepared to resist the proposed reduction of Is. 6d. per shift from 1st August, and to insist that half of the allowance of 21. Ss. granted 18 months ago be consolidated, and that the remaining half be subject to variations in the cost of living. Voters are also asked whether they agree that when a strike ballot is taken the joint executive shall be empowered to put the same into force when necessary or advisable.
