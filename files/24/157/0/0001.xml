GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraph has been taken from the report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 5th April: General Survey of the Labour Situation for the week ending 5th April. The complete stoppage of work in all the coal mines of Great Britain which took place on the evening of the 31 st March has been the outstanding feature of the week. Although the stocks of coal in the country are probably larger and the demand for coal, owing to the general industrial depression, undoubtedly less, than on the occasion of the coal strike in October last, the present dispute is much more serious for two reasons. Firstly, the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain have refused to allow the pumpmen and others engaged in keeping the mines in condition to remain at work; and secondly, the wide prevalence among trade unionists of the view that the proposed reductions in the miners&apos; wages will, if enforced, be followed by similar reductions in the wages of all other workers, has brought sympathetic action by the railwaymen and transport workers within the realm of probability. As regards the first point, safety workers have already ceased work except in some parts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire, and the flooding of several pits has already been reported. With regard to the second point, a general conference of the executive committees of the unions affiliated to the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation met in London on the 5th April to consider their policy, and are meeting again on the 6th, when it is expected that a definite decision will be made. It should be noted that this is not an ordinary delegate conference, but a conference of the executives of the affiliated unions, and is, therefore, in a much stronger position with regard to calling a strike. A special general meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen is also being held on the 6th, and it is probable that a joint meeting of the National Union and of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation, as well as a meeting of the triple alliance, will also be held on that day. The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, however, are holding aloof from the dispute, on the ground that they are not members of the triple alliance and have not been consulted in the matter. In view of the gravity of the situation, the first proclamation of emergency issued under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, was published on the 31st March, and was followed on the 4th April by an Order in Council under the Act which conferred far-reaching powers upon the various departments of State concerned, to enable them to deal with any emergency that may arise.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., xxxiv, p. 2]. The Viceroy, in reporting [No. 238] information received from Waziristan on 4th April, said that there had been some increase of hostilities, during which on. 22nd March our camel convoy had been, attacked near Manzai, entailing small casualties on either side. A. further attack on our picketing troops near Lhada on 24th March had resulted in somewhat heavier casualties.   On 28th March Makin was subjected to air bombing in retaliation.On 7th April the Viceroy telegraphed [No. 239] that the bombing reported above had effected the evacuation of Makin. but that in the Lhada and Wana lines sniping was still continuing.   The situation in East Persia was stated to be normal.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xl, p. 3]. In continuance of previous telegrams received from Sir Henry Dobbs the Viceroy transmitted [436 S.] on 24th March a telegram from the former saying that notwithstanding Tarsi&apos;s promise to resume discussions by 21st March no sign had yet been made by him.On 23rd March Sir Henry Dobbs reported. transmitted [445 S.] on 25th. March  that Tarsi had declared the impossibility of renewing discussions before 2Sth March, as the Afghans had not yet made up their minds. He proposed to leave for Delhi at once with the intention of returning to Kabul by 1st April.   .
OThe Viceroy telegraphed [453 S.] on 28th March that Sir Henry Dpbbs had  / submitted at Delhi his views on the situation at Kabul, and had indicated the several &apos; combinations which might arise. As an outcome of the most probable of these th&apos;4&apos; Viceroy suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should press for a disclosure^ of tlie&apos;1 draft treaty between Afghanistan, and the Soviet Government. [The text of this&apos;&apos; treaty as published by the Manchester Guardian on 31st March&quot; was telegraphed &apos; [No. 1820] to the Viceroy on 1st April, see F.C.R, xl, p. 2.] &apos;:         \On 5th April&apos;the Viceroy transmitted [483 S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs, from Kabul in which he reported a private meeting with Tarsi, in which.he had;, emphasized the necessity of the Russian treaty being disclosed before the draft treaty could be signed. Tarsi had raised several points on which disagreement still existedj . .among which the chief appeared to be the question of consulates. A. further meeting , was to take place on the 4th or 5th.April. &apos;&apos;.&apos;&quot;Further telegrams from  Sir Henry Dobbs dated  5th and  6th April were ? transmitted [489 S.] by the Viceroy on 6th April.   In these, Sir Henry reported&apos;-that he had received from Tarsi the amended Afghan treaty with an official letter, saying that it was absolutely final.   Sir Henry considered the treaty, as a.whole,.to ; be completely unacceptable.   The points to which he took the greatest objection were&apos;&apos; that the Afghans demanded British recognition of Afghan right to Arnawai, and agreement not to erect fortifications in Tandy Sar.   That the tribes who took part in the Afghan war were to be excused payment of lines and surrender of arms.   That&apos; the clause prohibiting foreign consulates in eastern Afghanistan was omitted, although &apos; British consulates in Herat, Turkestan and Kandahar were allowed.   That the British.,; Government undertook modifications in the Turkish treaty.   Finally, that the subsidy &quot; clause, fixing it at 25 lakhs, and stipulating for the payment of 1 crore and 36 lakhs-, at the time of ratification, omitted the condition of the fulfilment of the treaty.Sir Henry reported in his message of 6th April that he had seen Tarsi, and had told him that the draft was entirely unacceptable, and that if it was to be considered as final he would, leave at the earliest possible opportunity after the official conference.&apos; Tarsi had seemed to be upset, and proposed the withdrawal of the clause about the Turkish treaty.   He also undertook to consult the Amir about the final meeting. Sir Henry was of opinion that Tarsi was subject to the instigation of Amai-ul-Assas, who was known to be the Amir&apos;s personal agent in the matter.   While he held out a-faint hope of the Afghans climbing down he was preparing for departure from Kabul: on J.2th April.The Viceroy&apos;/) Weekly Reports. The following telegrams were sent on 29th March -and 8th april -I. (29th March). Section 1. Bombay. The student situation continues to improve. The non-co-operators have secured majorities at, certain municipal elections, Attempts are being made to boycott a public welcome to Lord Reading, but there is little response. The central caliphate Committee is attending in force, and will continue the series of caliphate lectures during the coming fair at Ajmere. From recent utterances it would appear that Gandhi may introduce the stage of non-payment of taxes within the next two months, but there is no confirmation of this from head-, quarters. The working committee of the Congress have met to discuss the possibility of deflecting the decision of Indian importers not to meet their bills until the exchange stabilizes at. 2s., in order to make it into a general movement for the boycott of foreign goods.Section 2. Bengal. The non-co-operation movement has shown little activity and that mainly in eastern Bengal, but the Bengal Vakil Association passed a resohw; tion advocating the suspension of practice in the High Court after 1st May as-a-l protest against the new rules of the appellate si.de of the High. Court, and the Legislative Council has reduced the provision for the High Court by Rs. 1,30,000. The question of what steps should be taken in this matter is under consideration. The Lillooah strike continues, and there, has been some further rioting. The application of section 144 in Mymensingh and elsewhere has raised protests, in which the moderate&apos; and neutral sections of the communities have to some extent joined.Section 3. There are indications that recent events in Bihar have affected the&apos;.&apos; -subordinate ranks of the police, and efforts inspired from Bihar are being made to; spread a spirit of discontent.Section 4. At the Beiigal Provincial Conference held on 25th, Pal, in his, presidential address, condemned unitary government and supported federal govern-
meat built up froin autonomous village communities.: Referring to the Congress-declaration of winning swaraj within a year by non-violent non-co-operation, lie-., declared this&quot;only possible through satisfactory compromise with Great Britain, and! that compromise was impossible without mutual, surrender.    The. first, item of compromise must be the amendment of the Government of India Act, incorporating., in it a definite declaration that, at the end .of a definite time limit, say 10 years, the control of every department of&apos; the administration should  be automatically \ transferred to the Indian legislatures responsible to, and removable by, Indian constituencies, including the control of national defence.   The second item&quot;must he-, the immediate repeal of all repressive laws, and restrictions of the power of the Governor-General to issue ordinances.   This would necessarily maintain the British connexion while removing the present subjection.   Pal condemned the tendency to ignore what English education and administration had done to inspire and strengthen modern democratic ideas and aspirations in India.   Could they afford to create, in their indignation against British bureaucracy, a mentality in the masses that would render all ,future reconciliation impossible ?   Of Gandhi, Pal declared he was the: greatest asset to the swaraj movement, but emphasized the dangers of a one-man movement,, which lapsed on the removal of the overawing personality of the leader. The escape of prisoners from Ragshahi Jail has been separately reported.\&quot;&apos; Section 5. Madras. A collision which occurred at Trichur in Cochin, between christians and mohamedans, in which Mapillas from the neighbouring district, Malabar, were called in, resulted in some looting and incendiarism and the death of one Christian, and proves how readily the fanaticism of the Mapillas can be played upon by political agitators. In the Presidency itself there is little to note beyond the usual. meetings and speeches. Vigorous attempts are being made from Madras to organize the non-co-operation movement throughout the Presidency, but there is a welcome indication that non-co-operators will not have matters all their own way.fThere is no further development of the movement to refuse payment of taxes,, although in more than one district attempts have been made to corrupt village officers.. In several recent municipal elections some few non-co-operators have secured seats, but not so many as they hoped.   The boycott of schools has made little progress.:. Punjab. Political interest centres chiefly on Nankana.   Much has been made-of the alleged instigation of crime by Government officials, but Bande Mataram has&apos; published the full apology for the attack on the Commissioner, Lahore.   Hindus are being alienated from sympathy&apos;! with the Sikhs on account of the destruction by the Akalis of idols and other objects of Hindu  veneration.   Gandhi&apos;s tour in the Province caused no excitement; on the contrary, his denunciation of violence is. reported to have a good effect.&quot; Section 6. The central Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee of Amritsar announce; that at a representative meeting of Sikhs it was unanimously resolved to. resort to-passive resistance if the Government did not release Sikhs unjustly arrested in: connexion with the Gurudwara reform movement, ,and did not pass satisfactory legislation for the management of the Gurudwaras b3&apos;. 10th April, and that all Sikhs; were united and determined to suffer for religion. . The Committee has been invited to.discuss matters with the Local Government on 30th instant.- The police enquiry ihtb the Nankana tragedy is now nearing completion, and it is hoped the accused in the case will be brought to trial in about 10 days. The police, with the aid of cavalry, have recently effected the successful capture of two men who are said to have taken a leading part in the affair. The Bill to make temporary provision for the .: management of the Sikh Gurudwaras pending further legislation has been prepared by the Local&apos; Government after consultation with some Sikh members of the Legislative. Council, and sanction to its introduction has-been accorded by the -Governor-General. Sirdar Dhulip Singh, of Swaraj Ashram Jullundur, is being prosecuted under section 124a, Indian Penal Code.United Provinces. There is no marked change in.the general situation, but there are signs of reaction of feeling against assaults on schools and colleges. A statement made in the Zamindar about an alleged bombardment of the shrine at Najaf lias caused intense feeling amongst the Shiahs. The complete information given in the-reply to a question in the Legislative Assembly will, it is hoped, remove the. misapprehensions of the Shiah community, and the Government has promised to give facilities for a deputation of Shiahs to visit Najaf and make further enquiries. The -effect&apos;of the uhfounded rumour has, however, been bad.
. Section 7. The march of . the movable column through the Fyzabad and Sultanptir districts is reported&apos;to have proved to the rural population that the power of the Government has not disappeared.. The hands of the zaminclars, whose authority had almost gone, have been greatly strengthened. A noticeable result is the cessation of the use of war cry defiance. More widespread action lias been taken under section 1-14. Section 108 has been brought into occasional use and prosecution for, sedition is being considered in a number of cases. There is a gradual development of activity under&apos; the ordinary law, and challenge of the non-co-operation movement is to be taken up more openly by officers of the Government. The eastern districts are being affected by the agitation in Bihar. The bordering tracts of Gorakhpur are threatened with a European boycott affecting the&apos; sugar and planting industries.Section 8. Owing to fresh disturbances in Rai Bareilly, separately reported,, the Seditious Meetings Act has been applied, to the districts Rai Bareilly, Fyzabad, Partabgarh, and Sultanpur for a period that may extend to one year. This action was taken with our concurrence on the earnest advice of the Governor in Council, acting with his Ministers, and a communique to this effect was issued.Section 9. Bihar and Orissa.-T.lie leaders of the non-co-operation movement are concentrating on the organization. Comparatively few meetings have been held&apos;, and with a few exceptions the speeches were more moderate in tone. The Punjab and the Caliphate are still prominent topics, but virulent abuse of the Government and Europeans generally which characterized the earlier non-co-operation oratory : is now less evideut. Unity, self-sacrifice, and absence of violence are now being impressed on their audience by most of the speakers. The lull in the agitation is no doubt ascribable in the main to the deliberate intention of the leaders, who cannot maintain excitement at concert pitch for any length of time without an outbreak of violence, but credit is also, due to the. more vigorous policy adopted by the Government in instituting prosecutions under the ordinary law-. The dying-clown of the agitation has already led to the slackening of public interest and to the beginnings of a counter movement, which is most noticeable in Patna and Gaya.Central Provinces. The situation has not materially changed since the last report. The main feature is the spread of non-co-operation in the villages due to-the campaign against assessments. No further disturbances have occurred at Nagpur, but there are indications of the spread of a lawdess spirit to the villages. Last night, the 28th, a mob of violent characters entered six liquor shops at Nagpur and destroyed their contents. The police dispersed the mob and made about 30 arrests. This morning the European magistrate, with a party of police, proceeded to arrest some individuals accused of taking part in last night&apos;s riot. After making a few arrests they were attacked by a large mob with clubs and stones,&apos; and the prisoners were rescued. The mob continued to stone the police, and after repeated warning, the magistrate ordered the police to fire. The mob then withdrew! Six were killed by police lire, and no wounded were recovered. Some police were injured but not seriously.; Burma. The chief event is the arrest of the Arakanese monk Oktamn for sedition. The trial is now proceeding, ills arrest caused considerable excitemeut amongst Burmans in Rangoon, where there were fairly complete hartals. The position as to the boycott of schools remains much the same. Money to finance the national schools is coming in slowly. An attempt made by moderate Indians to form an Indian Association to protect the interests of Indians in Burma was still-born, owing to the opposition of Indian extremists. Attempts are being made to combine&apos; the various political bodies in the interests of the non-co-operation movement. The attempts made by mohamedaiis in Rangoon to declare hartal over arrest of Yakub Hussaiu was unsuccessful.Section 10. Assam. A report has been received from Darrang of a riot in the Halem tea estate with assault on Europeans and babus. The latest report is that the situation is quiet, the coolies have returned to work, and the injured are progressing&apos; favourably.North-West Frontier Province. There is a lull in the more violent type of political agitation, although the position at Bannu is not wholly satisfactory. In Peshawar City two leaders were arrested, and on failure to furnish security were-imprisoned without exciting any public sympathy. The District Congress Committee, Peshawar, have formulated an ambitious programme, and its energies are directed towards the establishment of an arbitration tribunal and the Ata Committee. The-Panchayat Court has hitherto dealt with four petty cases, and the endeavours of the-
Ata Committee to open cheap grain shops met with-no success.. The Committee admit the failure to deal with the problem and consent to co-operate with the scheme proposed by the municipality for the distribution and sale of cheap grain. The previous ill-informed discussions and famine rates prevailing are responsible for. a situation fraught with potentialities of danger. There were &quot;rumours to tke effect that there would be a general loot in Peshawar City on lltli March, and the collection of bodies of men at various points appeared to substantiate the&apos; rumours. Trouble seemed imminent,&apos; but was averted by the issue of an order fixing the price of grain at a lower figure.;. Sikh meetings wore held in three districts in connexion with the Nankana incident. Insinuations were made of the complicity of the Government in the massacre.Section 11. The action taken by the Punjab Government against certain Sikh Jathashas had a salutary effect.   The turbulent spirits have modified their attitude.General. We have received replies from Local Governments to our circular letter on the policy to be-pursued in regard to non-co-operation and have discussed the whole question in Council. We have decided that for the present no radical, change in policy is required, but that Local Governments should be urged to institute prosecutions more freely under the ordinary law, not only against those guilty of incitements to violence, but also against persons whose speeches are calculated to produce feelings likely to lead to violence in the near future. We have, however, instructed them that no prosecution of Gandhi should be undertaken without previous reference to us. The situation generally shows little change from that reported in the last telegram. PaPs admission at the Bengal Conference is significant, and seems to suggest that a section of non-co-operators are prepared to parley, and may indicate disagreement with C. R. Das. The Sikh situation in the Punjab has improved as a result of measures recently taken, but still gives cause for anxiety, as does also the agrarian situation in the United. Provinces.Section 12. Gandhi had issued a manifesto to give fillip to the movement by recalling the events of Oth and loth April 1919, and urging special observance during that period this year which should be a week of true penance, devotion, and renunciation, fast being observed on 6th and 13th for 21 hours. No village in India should be without these observances. The practical measures advocated contain no new items, but temperance, truth, simplicity, and communal unity are inculcated, and Hindus are enjoined to consider no ,one as untouchable, but all as on equality. Violent language is to be avoided, and. the most important work is to spread the spinning wheel and collect donations. It remains to be seen, whether, the movement . will acquire any fresh strength by the observance of this anniversary. The resolution of Jatkar, recommending that Local Governments should be instructed to abandon repressive measures, was rejected by the Assembly, and the resolution passed recom-mending that the Government should adhere to the policy enunciated by the Home Member, and avoid as far as possible the use of action under exceptional legislation in dealing with the non-co-operation movement. The feeling of the Assembly was unmistakably opposed ,t.o ,any weakening of the hands of Local Governments. We have appointed committees to examine repressive legislation and the press law and a preliminary meeting of the former has been held. We hope reports will be ready for the next session of the Assembly.II. (8th April J Section 1. Bombay. Gandhi has advocated hartals for the 9th and the .13th, with special, efforts to collect a balance of one crore of rupees for the Tilak swaraj fund and to induce liquor shopkeepers to give up their licenses. Gandhi is disappointed with the progress of the non-co-operation movement in the presidency and talks of confining his activities to the Punjab and Bengal after consolidating the temperance movement in the Central Provinces. Ohotaui has wired the disappointment felt by the deputation at the result of the second interview with the Prime Minister and urges that the time has arrived for India to get ready for a supreme effort.United Provinces. There have been six convictions under the ordinary law for seditious speaking, and two new cases have been sanctioned. The. Shiahs who were disturbed by Najaf rumours are still disinclined to accept the Government assurance,, but are now settling down. The general political situation shows signs of a lull in so far as the more violent forms of agitation are concerned, but does not portend&apos; peace. There is evidence&apos;of altered methods and intensive organization ; our political equilibrium is unstable and the cult of Gandhi&apos;ism is taking a strong superstitious turn.   Miracles are commonly being attributed to him by many (&apos;? mohamedans)
*fcorrupt group) at this season, giviug groat grounds for uneasiness, as this isthe slackest period of the agricultural year. It has already been established in court; in the last Rai Bareilly case, that the police would have been annihilated had they not used firearms.Punjab. Sikh affairs continue to monopolize attention. The Bill referred to last week will be introduced, to-day. Violent village meetings were held in Hoshiapur, but the Sikh educational conference passed off quietly. There was no disturbance at the Anandpur fair or at Muktsar, partly owing to the reconstitution of the local -committees and partly owing to the presence of troops, now withdrawn. Otherwise there has been no pronounced development. Gandhi has not enhanced his popularity by his recent (our,Section 2. But congress emissaries, chiefly students, continue to tour about congress committees, trying to establish branches in villages in connexion with non-co-operation. The panchayats, however, had refused, to take cognizance of serious matters.Section 3. The provincial caliphate committee&apos;s conference was a fiasco. There has been some trouble in a few villages of the Ferozepore district over the collection of water rates. The deputy commissioner had four lambardars arrested ...as defaulters, and all. outstandings were paid up. It is reported that considerable satisfaction was expressed at the power given the Legislative Council, and the realization that it is genuine.Section 4. The provincial congress committee has advised the organization of hartal on 6th and 13th April in every town and village, warning the people to avoid violence and coercion. The trial of those implicated in the Nankana tragedy began yesterday in Lahore under ordinary law.Section 5. Bengal. (. land hi did not attend, the Barisal conference for reasons which are not fully known, but it seems clear that there has been some split amongst the leaders. Considerable activity is reported, but the non-co-operation movement has not advanced, and there is a general air of expectation as to the next move. A mass meeting was held with a view to convene a conference with the moderates in April to support the reforms, and decide upon the measures to be taken to oppose the non-co-operation movement. The caliphate agitation has made no headway. In -schools and colleges the situation is, generally speaking, satisfactory.Section 0. C. 11. Das held a meeting of protest against B. C. 1&apos;al&apos;s address at Barisal, owing&apos; to the absence of any reference to non-co-operation.Section 7. (? Delhi) Things are quiet. On 30th March was celebrated the second --anniversary of the outbreak of disturbances.   A demonstration designed to celebrate the memory of the &quot; martyrs &quot; was not a great success.   A half-hearted hartal took place in the main bazaars.   Non-co-operation has made no further headway, and funds for this and. the caliphate agitation are at present unobtainable.North-West Frontier Province. The most important event of the fortnight was a fracas between Hindus and Sikhs on the 23rd. Fifteen persons were injured, axes and kirpans having been used freely. Order was quickly restored, and some 13 men, all Sikhs, were arrested. The deputy commissioner issued orders attaching Dharmsala, the cause of the dispute, and forbidding the carrying of dangerous weapons within Peshawar city. In Hazara and Bannu there has been a more active propaganda in favour of non-co-operation, but in Bannu the majority of important and influential men have no sympathy with the agitation. The mullahs generally support the caliphate and non-co-operation agitation since they see in it the hope of re-establishing their old ascendancy.Section 8. The real object of the temperance agitation is shown by the resolution passed, recently at the Bilaspur conference, to the effect that trade in excisable articles should be boycotted, with a view to cripple the financial resources of ministers and so paralyze their administrative activities.Section !). Bhagwan Din, a favourite disciple of Gandhi, lias been sentenced to 18 months&apos; rigorous imprisonment for sedition. He made no defence, and. is now threatening a hunger strike. The organization for the establishment of non-co-operation committees in villages has made some progress. Students are touring the villages, in addition to the regular agitators. The non-payment of taxes and. village watchmen s dues is preinenmbent on the campaign against liquor being carried on. Disaffection is undoubtedly spreading amongst the villages, where incidents, them-selves unimportant, have occurred, indicating a lawless attitude.   On the other hand,
there are signs of reaction against non-co-operation amongst the more sober elements,., and even among some non-co-operative leaders. Reaction is most marked amongst the Marwari supporters, many of whom are said to lie opposed to supplying any further funds.Bihar and Orissa.-There is a distinct lull in the non-co-operative agitation.. There is some evidence that a general agitation against cow-killing is springing up. GandhPs reception at Cattack was not particularly enthusiastic, and the meetings held-were comparative failures.. Section 1.0... General. The All-India congress committee on the 1st April resolved to make an appeal for one crore of rupees for the Tilak memorial fund, for the introduction into villages of 20 lakhs of spinning wheels, and [? declared] the action of die Government against non-co-operation as unwarranted and illegal, and that the country was not yet sufficiently disciplined, organized and ripe for the-immecliate taking up of civil disobedience. Gandhi appealed for an extension of the spinning wheel movement as being full of potentialities for winning swaraj. According to the Hindu (Madras paper) Gandhi pointed out that the real object of the propaganda in respect of titles, councils, courts and educational institutions, had&apos; been satisfactorily achieved, and those who still continued in schools and courts were convinced of the congress principles, but unable for various reasons to give effect to -them.   The congress should trust to time for the movement to work its way fully hereafter; there&apos; was no need for concentration on these iterns, but;in order to achieve&apos; the propaganda of swarajya (sic) within the time mentioned, they should concentrate on the. points which would enable the masses, whose awakening was phenomenal, to feed and clothe themselves independent of foreign goods. The spinning wheel movement was of the utmost importance. He urged the leaders not to Jag behind the masses and appealed for one crore of workers and one crore of funds. Tie emphasized the entirely unjustifiable character, of the several proceedings taken by the authorities against non-co-operators, but felt that until the spirit, of thorough self-restraint had come into the people they should not initiate civil disobedience. If anyone offered civil disobedience he should do so on his own responsibility and not in the name of the congress.Section II.   The fact that the congress committee has refused to sanction civil disobedience is significant, and tends to confirm the impression referred to in our last telegram that a considerable section of the non-co-operators are prepared to parley.. As yet, however, we- have no reliable indication of their minimum demands.THE DOMINIONS.Herman Repara.tion.-On 1.1th April the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governors-General of Canada and New Zealand informing them, that the Prime Minister had telegraphed as follows in reply to an enquiryfrom the -Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia.: In regard to the distribution of the proceeds of the 50 per cent, tax no final arrangements have yet been made between the Allies, but our idea is that each country should retain all receipts up to its percentage of the total, which is in the case -of the British Empire 22 per cent., and only transfer any surplus over and above that amount to the Reparation Commission. The question of the distribution between various parts of the Empire of the 22 per cent, attributable to the British Empire is one of the matters which will have to be considered at the conference in June. Only if the German Government is willing to refund to its nationals the amounts deducted by the Allies -would the 50 per cent, deduction be really productive in raising money on reparation account. It will otherwise operate principally as a penalty. At the -reparation conference Dr. Simons informed me that he was willing to accept this mode of paying reparation, but of course only as a part of a general agreement.German Reparation Recovery Act. On 31st March the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and the Governor of Newfoundland that the German Reparation Recovery Act had been assented to, and that, it took effect as from 1st April except as regarded goods imported before 15th April, if it were proved to the satisfaction of the-
Commissioners of Customs and Excise that the goods were imported in pursuance of a contract entered into before 8th March. He added that the alterations in the text of the Bill made during its passage through the House of Commons were being sent by mail. It was understood that Belgium had passed a similar law and that the French Government had presented a Bill to the Chamber. Portugal, Romnania, and Sam had undertaken to initiate similar legislation.The Aerial Navigation. Convention.
