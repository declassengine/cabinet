COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, Sea.EGYPT.The Wafd.-Qn 12th January Lord Allenby reported [No. 20] that a split had occurred in the newly reconstituted Wafd; Abdel Aziz Bey Fahmy had resigned, and it was expected that six other members would announce their secession.Telegraphing [No. 24] again on 17th January, he further reported that though this group of the Wafd had not yet seceded, he had learnt, from a good source that they were determined to do so if they could not dictate its policy. Pie also heard that they had stated that they would endeavour to help Sarwat Pasha unobtrusively, but could not do so openly.INDIA.Treaty with Afghanistan. The Secretary of State for India has circulated the full text of the Anglo-Afghan treaty as signed. The treaty consists of a preamble, fourteen articles and two schedules. The articles deal with the following subjects :  Article I. Mutual respect by the two Governments of all rights of independence. II, The alignment of boundaries, and provisions for.water rights. III. Exchange of Ministers. IV. The establishment of respective consulates. V. Mutual guarantees for the safeguard of representatives, and of their rights and privileges. VI. Pro-visions for the purchase and import of material necessary for Afghanistan, and for the export of goods to India. Also for the importation in Afghanistan of arms and munitions. VII. Customs duties. VIII. The establishment of trade agencies in India subject to British jurisdiction. IX. The powers of such agencies.X. Postal facilities. XL The maintenance of order among the frontier tribes. XII.&apos; Arrange-in ents for the establishment of a trade convention. XIII. The schedules attached to have the same values&apos; as the articles. XIV. The date of the treaty coming into force, viz., two and a half months after ratification; the period of remaining in force, viz., three years, and to continue thence subject to twelve months&apos; notice of denouncement on either side. The two schedules concern (1) the boundary lines referred to in Article PP., and (2) the legations and consulates.The Frontier Question [B.E.1.L, lx, p. 3], -The Viceroy transmitted [17 S.] on 7th January a telegram received from the Afghan Foreign Minister, dated 2nd January, which purported to be a reply - to Lord CurzoiPs telegram of 21st December, regarding the frontier incidents. Tarsi stated that the leaders of the offending Waziri tribes had. been settled with, and had been informed of the relations between the two Governments, and had been prohibited from any such action in future. Tarsi referred only to the raid from Shahjui, aud said that the Afghan Ambassador to the Court of St. James would bring full details regarding the affair.Commenting on the omission of reference to the Khost raid, coupled with the reference to the Afghan Minister, the Viceroy considered that it was intended to indicate pressure for an early acceptance of the Afghan nomination.Exchange of Ministers [B.E.R., Ix, p. 3]. The Secretary of State sent [107] on 9th January a message from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Afghan Foreign Minister announcing the appointment of Major Francis Henry Humphrys, C.I.E., to be His Majesty&apos;s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary.at Kabul.Further messages from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs were transmitted [161] on the 12th January. The first message stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no objection to the appointment of Abdul Hadi Khan as Afghan Minister in London, The second message made similar acceptance, of the appointments of Muhammad Haidar Khan as Consul-General in India, and of Muhammad Akbar Khan as Consul at Bombay.   The third message pointed out the control of the Government
of India and tho local governments lay with the Secretary oE State for India ami not with the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs.The Viceroys Fortnightly lie-port. The following telegram was sent from Delia on 12th. January :-Section. 1. 1 Join bay. Interest (luring the last fortnight of December centred round the congress and moslem league sessions and the All-India caliphate conference at AhmedabadSection 2. The attitude of the extremist section, led by Dasrat Mohaui, and especially the pan-islamic tenor of his address and of his speeches on the Chandra creed, have revived strong misgivings in hindu circles in regard to moslem policy.Section 3. There are various indications that Gandhi is anxious for a round table conference, if one can be arranged on terms not too inconsistent with his previous attitude. His main efforts are now directed towards detaching the moderates- and rallying all shades of opinion under a general appeal for freedom of speech and peaceful association. The reports indicate that the picketing of liquor shops wdll be started shortly at Bardoli, Nadiad and Alnnedabad.Section -1. It is difficult to forecast developments once aggressive civil disobedience is started in these (? areas) under the personal leadership of Gandhi. All possible arrangements have been made to meet eventualities, and these are reported, to have had a steadying effect. The situation is extremely fluid, but the probability is in favour of Gandhi pursuing dilatory tactics for the present.United Provinces. -The Christmas holidays and the absence of the Congress delegates at Ahuiodabad caused something of a lull, excepting in large towns, where the volunteer defiance has been provocative and insolent (corrupt group). The political atmosphere is electric with expectation, but it is not possible to forecast events until the return of the delegates, and until the result of the congress resolutions becomes operative. Arrests are comparatively numerous at Allahabad, Lucknow and Benares ; anxiety to flout law and order and to create the maximum of unrest, compatible with the absence of open violence, is apparent, and&apos; must, if persisted in, work mischief. The antipathy to the decided action of the huge doctrinaire section of the liberal party has found expression in resolutions and protests, which have undone much of the good resulting from.the application of the new policy, but it is none the less clear that the policy taken has had a steadying effect.Section 5.- The Governors darbar at Lucknow was crowded and successful, and his statement of the determination of the.Government to put down the defiance of authority was applauded.Section C. Burma. Internments and the other measures taken by the Govern-merit had the effect of considerably relaxing the tension. No attempts have been made to hold meetings in defiance of the law. Propaganda urging people to take part in the reception of the Prince of Wales is believed to have had a good effect, but anonymous leaflets have been circulated warning the people of Rangoon of the serious consequences of participation.Assam. The continued enlistment of volunteers is reported in several districts, but there has been no actual breach of peace. In Goalpara desertions from the civil police temporarily caused unpleasant situations. The leaders of non-co-operation and the caliphate committees in Sylhet have undertaken to repudiate the more objectionable features of the propaganda.Bengal. The efforts of the non-co-operators to bring about a complete hartal on the 24th culminated on the 23rd, when a large number of arrests had to be made. The police did not lose control, and thereafter the opposition, in the later stages of which students had been replaced by mill hands and low-class mohamedans, collapsed.Section 7. On the 27th, at a public entertainment on the maidan, the Prince received a spontaneous and enthusiastic welcome from, an immense crowd.Section 8. It is too early to gauge with certainty the effect of fhe royal visit on the political, situation, but its undoubted, success in face of the most dangerous and insidious opposition, cannot fail to operate for good outside Calcutta. The hartal of tlie 24th was widespread and also complete in most parts of the presidency, the caliphate party being increasingly prominent and violent. Except in a few localities, all ordinary activities were stopped. The agitation has had a demoralizing effect on the students, and almost everywhere it has been found advisable to close down
the colleges some days in advance of the Christinas holidays. To some extent the volunteer activity has been stimulated by the policy of openly defying the Government, but in spite of this the general situation has somewhat improved as a result of the-action taken, as open picketing and open preaching of sedition has ceased inmost places. The opinions of the local officers unanimously support the line now beino-followed by the Government, though the difficulties are fully realized. Some unrest has been, observed among the district police in Bang-pur: live constables have resigned. In Noakhali the reliability of the armed police is doubtful. In Iiowrali an appreciable number of up-country constables and head constables are believed to-be in sympathy with non-co-operation. The reports from most districts, however favour (sic) a number of prosecutions against leaders have been instituted durina&quot; the last half of December.Section 9. The total number of arrests of volunteers in Calcutta since the 17th November is 3,230, of which .1,515 were effected in the week ending Christmas day ; of those arrested 3,14-5 have been sent up to the magistrate, the remainder being-warned and discharged by the police; of those sent up for trial, 1,-873 have been convicted, 370 discharged, mostly on the plea of repentance, and 911 are under remand.Section 10, The above figures are for Calcutta only. General instructions have been, given to prosecute the leaders as far as possible, and to exercise discretion in the award of sentences to minor offenders, especially young boys. The cases of those sentenced to less than six months are being reviewed, with a view to reduction and the release ol prisoners where such course is considered safe. Most of the student class have already been, released. The general atmosphere in Bengal is undoubtedly better than during the week before, and the so-called moderate opinion shows some sign of veering round again, to a modified support of the Government,, but the position is uncertain, and will mainly depend, on -(? how we) compromise. Outside Bengal, most of the Bengal leaders are under arrest and their trial may cause excitement. It is certain that non-co-operators will endeavour to regain the-ascendency they have lost through the success of the Brince&apos;s visit. They&apos;may resume the policy of trying to force mass arrests, but the student class will probably not be so eager to co-operate, and they may have to fall back on paid volunteers of the lower classes, a supply of whom will be. forthcoming-only so long as funds last. These will be mostly mohamedans, and their employment will accentuate the existing tendency for the caliphate agitators to take charge. Industrial unrest would precipitate matters by interrupting the work of the factories round Calcutta, and let loose the mohamedan coolies exasperated by economic distress; while there are-indications of railway trouble which may seriously complicate the situation, but the action of the congress leaders will be the main factor in the near future, and the-probabilities point to the ascendency of violence in the agitation.Punjab. Civil disobedience has made little progress. The arrest and trial of the-agitators has, on the wdtole, given rise to less popular excitement than was antici-pated.As regards the volunteers, the policy has generally been (? latterly) of dis-persing unlawful assemblies in preference to making arrests. Eighteen resignations of Government servants on political or religious grounds have been reported. The situation as regards the Sikh agitation is much as before. There is said to-be intense feeling amongst the Sikhs, mainly over the affair of the keys of the treasury of the Golden Temple. Special enquiries are being made as to the extent to which this feeling has spread to the rural tracts. Two small shrines in the Ambala and. Sialkot districts, which were practically unoccupied, have been taken over by the akalis without untoward incident. Only 1.10 votes were recorded for the vacancy on the local Legislative Council, caused by the resignation, of Mehta prej-. Singh, now in jail. There are, however, some reassuring features in the Sikh movement. Although the volunteers in Amritsar have given considerable trouble,, the Sikhs have held aloof from this, and are not generally joining in the volunteer movement, apart from the akali dal. At two meetings in Jidlundur violent akali speakers did not hold their ground. Four persons were arrested at the meeting,, and two others, for whom warrants were issued, bolted. The movement for the separation of Sikh politics from religion appears to have some strength. There is reason to believe that the Sikhs generally have not decided to throw in their lot with the non-co-operators, and that leaders are averse from risking for the akali jatas treatment similar to that which other volunteer organizations have received,
and are therefore holding them in restraint. Much will depend on the course of proceedings in the Civil. Court in connexion with the keys of the treasury. The deputy commissioner of Amritsar describes Sikh opinion as not unusually excited. The general review and forecast by the local government is as follows : At present it seems true to say that the Sikhs are not identified with the congress, that the rural population in general, and the western Punjabis in particular, are untouched, that the trouble is in the towns, and that there is more sound and fury than real substance to the discontent; but the press is more violent titan it was, and the moderates are in some measure alienated. Attempts by volunteers to parade and demonstrate are likely to continue iu Lahore, Amritsar and other large towns. Prices of foodstuffs should now tend to-fall, and there appears no reason to apprehend any immediate change for the worse in the general situation.Bihar and Orissa.-The concessions reported in last weelPs telegram are said to have had a good effect in Patna, and to have caused no harm in the mofussit districts. The action taken under the Criminal Law Amendment Act has varied in different districts, ft is noticeable that no prosecutions have been, necessary in Chaniparan, where the action taken subsequent to the burning of the Chauterwa factory had a sobering, effect, generally speaking. The notification of fOtli December lias stirred the leaders in towns to activity, but has diverted the civil disobedience movement for the time being from attacks on police stations and the no-rent campaign to a mere protest against the proclamation ; though, in Sitamarhi a thana on the Nepal, frontier was invaded- by the mob, who insulted the police ; seven leaders were arrested. In the same district, the thana compound at Hajipur was rushed by the mob, who attempted to drive away by force the beggars to whom alms were being distributed. In Bauchi a particularly brutal outrage was reported. A mohamedan liquor vendor was refused burial; the ceremony took place with police assistance in the night; the body was exhumed, and placed with the face mutilated on the public road. It is believed, that iu some districts, notably Muzalfarnagar, Pur Saran, and Monghyr, a. faithful and determined attempt will be made to carry out any orders of congress, but elsewhere the non-co-operators have probably not much stamina.Central Provinces. The last half of December was entirely lacking in incident.. The Nagpur leaders have returned to their original support of Gandhis programme, on account of the action taken by the Government in some provinces. The conference of the jamaitul-uleinas proved a fiasco, as none of the recognized ulemas-turned up. So far it does not. appear that the appeal for civil disobedience will meet with much response in the province. The touring officers report that a better feeling prevailed in the rural, area.Madras. No report for the second half of December has been received from the local Government. A press telegram of Stir January states that the Anclhra provincial congress committee at a meeting held at Bezwada, resolved that all taxes payable to the Government should be withheld until the 20th January, or until all the district congress committees decide and empower all district committees in Anclhra Desa to decide about the non-payment of taxes throughout the whole or part of the respective districts with due regard to local conditions. The same, telegram also states that the national volunteers were seen parading the streets of Madras on the 8th, exhorting people to boycott the Pfince&apos;s visit and observe hartal on the 1.3th instant.General. As already mentioned there is some reason to believe that Gandhi is really anxious for a round-table conference. According to information from private1 sources, he believes that a compromise must. come. He has agreed to attend a meeting on the 14th, at which prominent moderate leaders will be present, and it is probable that at this meeting attempts will bo made to arrive at a common platform acceptable to all parties, with a view to presenting definite terms to the Government through an intermediary. If the meeting fails to agree on terms-the efforts of the non-co-operators will be concentrated on the volunteer issue, with a view to forcing on the Government action which would alienate all moderate support and sweep the moderates into tho non-co-operation, camp.The Moslem Question [B.E.R., fx, p. 6]. The Secretary of State for India has circulated the following extracts from a private letter written by the Governor of Bombay on 23rd December : We are not having a very happy Christmas in India, and for the first time since I landed I feel, the position to be really grave.   Up to now we have had our share 
aud this side of India perhaps more than our share -of anxiety and difficulty, but I have never until now felt that the situation was fundamentally dangerous if we handled it with prudence and patience. But I have all aloug endeavoured to point out to you that unless the Moslem question were boldly and promptly rectified by the Cabinet the position might at any time become very serious. In support of this may I refer you to my several private letters and telegrams to you and especially my telegram of 15th October [B.E.R. lx, p. 6J. I know how fully you share my views, and we are all grateful for the support winch we are confident you have given to Indian claims on the matter. But what matters effectively is that a concrete result should be obtained, and I am .seriously alarmed at the position of affairs out here at the present time.Meanwhile we must hold on. with- determination while you get us a settlement of the Moslem question. This settlement must now be a definite one. Anything less than the one 1 have several times suggested will be ineffective. The Enos Midia line drawn back to include Adrianople is the minimum in Thrace ; all Anatolia, including Smyrna and Ciiicia, must be Turkish, and a Vatican position in Mecca and Medina, Kerbela and Nejf. I wish I were at home to take a hand in it, for I can t bring myself to believe such a solution impossible of achievement but 1 daresay I underrate the difficulties. Such a settlement, but I think only such a settlement, will now save the situation here.I cannot add anything, I think, to what I have often written to you on the subject which could ,enhance the importance which I think this question has for us in this country&apos; and indeed I think in all our foreign relations as well. Unless this settlement is come to immediately it will come too late, and I am telegraphing to this effect to you again to-day, not because I doubt of your appreciation of the situation, but in the hopes that these representations may strengthen your hand.And so I repeat that I see no safe course except to remedy grievances which are real, and. having done so to sit firm and refuse to bend to clamour. The grievance which needs immediate settlement is the Moslem grievance. We simply must have this settled, and settled on generous lines. I do beg of you most earnestly not to allow a settlement of a partial character to be announced ; it would be fatal, and -would settle nothing.THE DOMINIONS.Advisory Committee on Civil Aviation. On 6th January the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand : The Air Council consider it desirable to replace the standing advisory committee on civil aviation by a new body more closely related to the Air Ministry, to be called the Civil Aviation Advisory Board. The proposed terms of reference are to advise generally on the development of civil aviation and to report upon any specific point referred to it by the Secretary of State for Air. The proposed composition is;  Chairman, the Under Secretary of State for Air ; and members, the controller-general of civil aviation, the director-general of supply and research, representatives of the General Post Office and six unofficial bodies concerned with aviation. The Air Council is anxious not to overlook the interests of the Dominions, but do not consider permanent representation of much practical advantage, and suggest that the Board should consult the representatives of the Dominions when occasion arises, as in the case of the advisory committee. If your Ministers concur, please telegraph the name of the representative nominated, as it is desired, to announce the formation of the board on 7 th. February.AUSTRALIA.Air Communication [B.E.R., lix, p. 6]. The following telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies was sent to the Governor-General on 9th January :  In view of the financial position and the present state of development in air communication the Government of the Union of South Africa regret that they do
not feel warranted in placing any proposal for expenditure in connexion with the Imperial Air Service before the forthcoming session of Parliament.Zinc Industry [B.E.R., Ix, p. 7]. In reply to the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 2nd January, the Governor-General transmitted the following telegram on 17th January:-The Palme Minister states that in face of the circumstances perfectly well known to His Majesty&apos;s Government, in which the spelter and zinc transactions were carried through, and as the British Government s offer was an integral part of the arrange-ment made, lie cannot admit that the mere lapse of time, which arose out of consideration by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia for the circumstances of the British Government, can now relieve the British Government of all responsibility in connexion therewith.NEW ZEALAND.Butler.- On 5th January the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of New Zealand as follows in reply to the latteFs telegram of 4th January: The Board of Trade agree to postpone the bulk sale until .14th January, but state that the market here has improved somewhat and their selling price raised on 4th January 2s. per cwt. The sales for the week ended 3rd January exceed 2,000 tons. Hence, if the proposed bulk purchase scheme is proceeded, with, slightly higher terms may be asked than those originally contemplated.Air Communication [B.E.R., lix, p. G]. On 9th January a telegram identically the same as that printed under Australia was&apos; sent to the Governor-Cieneral by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.SOOTH AFRICA.Air Communication [B.E.R., lix, p. 6]. On 6th January the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in reply to the latteFs telegram of 13th December, that his Ministers regretted that, in view of the financial position and the present stage of development in air communication, they did not feel warranted in placing any proposal for expenditure in this connexion before the forthcoming session o I: parliament am en t.Strike. The Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 10th January that he regretted having to report serious industrial unrest in the Transvaal. The coal miners had struck on 1st January, the gold miners, power company&apos;s employees and some minor trades that day. The meeting of Parliament was postponed until 17th February.NEWFOUNDLAND.Royal Naval. Reserve. On 9th January the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed as follows to the Governor of Newfoundland, in reply to a telegram sent by the hitter on 6th December : The Admiralty is anxious to assist the Newfoundland Government in the develop-ment of the Royal Naval Reserve, but are not in a position to incur any increased expense during the present financial year, as provision has not been made in the Navy estimates. Definite proposals for the future are being drawn up and will be forwarded for consideration as soon as possible. As regards the Briton, the Admiralty is of opinion that training could be carried out more economically on shore, and the new scheme contemplates this. The crew of the Briton has been withdrawn, and the Admiralty would prefer to proceed with the sale of the vessel, the expense of the maintenance of which is not justified in their opinion. The Admiralty will reserve from the sale the guns, mountings and any stores or appliances on board which may be of use for training reserves on shore and transfer them, without charge, to the Newfoundland Government if desired.
