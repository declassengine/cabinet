GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs have been taken from the Reports of the Ministry of Labour issued on 11th and 18th June :-General Survey of Lite Labour Situation for the week ending \ith June. Apart from the coal dispute, the industrial situation has improved, and there is every reason to believe that while the employers are anxious to reduce costs of production, and the workpeople to safeguard their standard of living, there is a general desire on both sides to obtain settlements without recourse to drastic action. A settlement of the dispute in the cotton textile industry appears to be imminent. The employers in the engineering industry have agreed to suspend, until the end of June, the notices of reduction which were to have come into force on the 16th ; and, in the meantime, a ballot vote of the men will be taken on the question of the acceptance of the employers&apos; proposals. The negotiations in the woollen textile industry ended, on the loth June in a settlement, the employers&apos; proposals for a reduction in wages, after slight modification, being ultimately accepted by the operatives. There are also indications of a renewed desire to settle the long drawn-out dispute of shipyard joiners which began on the 1st December last. The matter was discussed at a conference held in London on the 10th June between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades.The agricultural workers are seriously disturbed at the proposed abolition of the Agricultural Wages Hoards, which, they fear, will, result in a substantial reduction of their wages, and the unions concerned are arranging to call a national conference to consider what means shall be adopted to resist the Governments proposals. Proposed reductions in wages affecting tramwaymen and gas workers are also announced, and meetings of the men concerned have been held during the week to consider them.The Unemployment Position. On the 27th May, in the United Kingdom, 2,103,782 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,553,091 were lodged by males and 550,691 by females. At the same date 1,188,397 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 008,485 were lodged by males and 579,912 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 66,565 totally unemployed and 7,319.working short time.The total on the live register of all employment exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 3rd June was 2,147,400. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.On the 3rd June, in the United Kingdom, 2,133,085 unemployment books under&apos; the Unemployment Insurance Act, and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which .1,571,084 were lodged by males and 562,001 by females. At the same date 1,181,034 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 610,645 were lodged by males and 570,389 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 29,303 workers totally imemployed and a decrease of 7,363 in those working short time.The total on the live register of all employment exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 10th J une was 2,185,700. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Bill, 1921.-A Bill for the further amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act was introduced into the House of Commons by the Minister on the 8th June. The object of the Bill is to vary the rates of contributions and the rates and periods of benefits under the Acts. The Minister, in introducing the Bill, stated that the first amendment of the Act, in March.last, was based on the assumption that the rate of unemployment would not exceed an average of 9  per cent, among insured, persons for the period ending july 1922 ; and it was calculated that, taking into account the increased contributions imposed by the Act of March 1921, as from the 1st July next, and with benefits at the rate of 20s. for men
and 15.5. for women, boys and girls receiving half rates on this basis, the Unemployment Fund would have been able to discharge all liabilities and be free of debt in July 1922. As the present rate of unemployment amongst insured persons is 23 per cent., and as benefit is being paid out at the rate of 2,000,000/. per week, with an income from contributions of less than 350,000/. per week, the Fund, which in March last amounted to 22i- million pounds, now amounts to 8  millions only, and will be practically exhausted by the end of the present month. The Act of March provided for the payment of not more than Hi weeks&apos; benefit in each of two &quot; special periods &quot; -ending the 2nd November 1921 and the 2nd July 1922, respectively. A considerable number of unemployed persons will shortly have exhausted the full 16 weeks&apos; benefit payable in the first special period. In order to meet the financial.difficulty and. to make benefit available for more than 16 weeks the Bill proposes-(i) to reduce the rate of benefit from 20s. a week to 15*. in the case of men, andfrom 16s. a week to I2s. in the case of women, with corresponding reductions in the case of. juveniles, who are entitled to benefit at half the adult rates;(ii) to increase the joint contributions of employers and employed from the ratesof tic/, for men and 9(2. for women, as provided by the Act ol .1921, to Is. M. and Is. Id. respectively, with corresponding increases in the case of juveniles;(iiii to increase the &quot; waiting days &quot; from three.to six;(iv) to give power to the Minister to provide, in case of necessity, for two periods of benelit of not more than six weeks each, additional to the two benefit periods of 16 weeks each provided, up to the 2nd July 1922, by the Act of 1921 ;(v) to suspend the provisions of the Act of 1920 with reference to special schemes for particular industries ;(vi) to increase the borrowing powers of the Unemployment Insurance Fundfrom 10,000,000/., as at present provided, to 20,000,000/. A report with regard to the financial effects of these proposals has been prepared by the Government actuary and published as a White Paper (Omd. 1336). During the first part ol: the period ending July 1922 it is anticipated that the power of borrowing from the Treasury will have to be exercised up to a maximum of-16 millions. As employment returns to normal the deficiency will be made good; and the Fund should have repaid the whole sum advanced by the Treasury by July 1923.Belief of Unemployment. A conference of representatives of .16 Metropolitan Borough Councils was held at Bethnal Green on the 13th June to consider the problem of unemployment. A resolution was adopted demanding that, as unemploy-meut was a national problem, the Government should deal with it at the expense of the Imperial Exchecpier, and provide useful work or adequate maintenance. It was also agreed that the cost of all local relief works should be borne nationally, and that all grants made by Boards of Guardians for the relief of distress should be refunded from the Imperial Exchequer. It was further decided that arrangements should be made for holding meetings .in the boroughs represented, with a Wiew to concerted action, and that the Prime Minister should be requested to receive a deputation in support of the resolutions.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.FIJI.Proposed Visit of an Indian Committee. On 15th June the officer administering the Government reported to the Secretary of State that the following telegram had been sent to the Viceroy of India :-On 6th June the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to me the suggested terms of a public announcement to be made simultaneously in India and in Fiji, regarding the proposed visit of an Indian committee to Fiji. He requested that the terms of the proposed announcement should be&apos; telegraphed to you one week
&quot;before publication. Subject to&quot; your concurrence, I propose to issue the following-announcement on 25th June :  On 19th March 1920 the Secretary to the Government of India informed an unofficial mission from Fiji that, provided a general guarantee were given by an. ordinance to the effect that the position of Indian immigrants in. Fiji would, be equal to that of all. other subjects of His Majesty the King resident in Fiji, the Government of India wojdd be prepared to appoint a committee to visit Fiji in order to examine and test the general suitability of the scheme for renewed immigration of Indians into Fiji propounded by the unofficial mission to Jndja.2. After full discussion with the elected members of the Legislative Council and the representatives of the General Council of Planters, the Governor of Fiji informed the Secretary of State lor the Colonies in a despatch dated 3rd July 1920 that, subject to his approval and confirmation, the Government of Fiji were willing to give the required pledge. His Excellency requested that the Government of India might be so informed and invited to proceed with the appointment of a committee to visit Fiji at their early convenience.3. The Government of Fiji have now been informed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Government of India regret the delay which has occurred in the appointment of a committee, but after a full discussion of all the issues involved with the various members of the new Council of State and the Legislative Assembly, they now propose that a committee should visit Fiji in the early autumn this year.4. The committee will be composed of the following members: The Honourable Y. S. Srinivasa Sastri, member of the Indian Council of State ; Pandit Hirde Nath Kunzru, member of the Legislative Council of the United Provinces; Mr. G. L. Gorbett, C.I.E., deputy secretary to the Government of India, Commerce and Industry Department.5. The Government of India have suggested, and the Government of Fiji have concurred in the suggestion, that the prospect of the visit of the committee leading to definite and satisfactory results would be enhanced if. the scope of the enquiry were to be widened instead of being limited to the question as to suitability of the particular scheme proposed by the unofficial mission from Fiji to India.-6. The Government of India and the Government of Fiji have agreed accordingly that the terms of reference to the committee about to visit Fiji should be as follows: (1) To enquire into the conditions of Indians now resident in Fiji and to ascertain the causes of discontent; and (2) to advise whether, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, Fiji offers a suitable field for Indian colonization.7. The Government of India have informed the Government of Fiji in relation to the proposed investigation by the committee that there is no intention on their part to interfere with the domestic affairs of the colony of Fiji.S. Steps will be taken at an early date to introduce into the Legislative Council of Fiji an ordinance giving effect to the pledge required by the Government of India as conveyed in the letter of the Secretary to the Government of India of 19th March 1920, the acceptance of which by the Government of Fiji whs notified to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the despatch of 3rd july 1920.&apos;.). The Government of -Fiji has telegraphed to the Government of India welcoming the approaching arrival of the committee, to whom all facilities for investigation will be given.   The Government of Fiji feel confident that the labours of the committee will be productive of beneficial results to the people t of India and to the future welfare of this colony and its inhabitants.10. The Government of India and the Government of Fiji unite earnestly in hoping that the measures now being taken will promote a better understanding between the two countries and will lead to the mutual advantage of both India and Fiji.The ordinance referred to in the first paragraph of the proposed announcement will -be passed shortly in accordance with the draft which has been already transmitted to theUiovernment of India, and which the Secretary of State for the Colonies lias informed the Government of Fiji will be acceptable. Permit me finally to express the keen appreciation felt in Fiji of the interest which your Excellency has taken iu
this matter and to convey the.thanks of the colony that a renewal of negotiations regarding the future immigration of Indians into Fiji has thus been rendered practicable.Australian JJuti/ on. Bananas. On 10th June the officer administering the Government informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies .that the following resolution had been passed by the Suva Chamber of Commerce : -That this Chamber strongly resents the abnormal increase of the duty on bananas recently imposed by the Federal Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, and respectfully requests that the Government of Fiji should make a .  . strong representation to the Commonwealth of Australia with the object of reducing if not removing the recently imposed increase of duty on Fiji bananas. Mr. Fell went on to say the new duty involved an increase of from 2s. Gel. to 8,5. Ad. per cental, and was equivalent to prohibition.   The banana trade in Fiji was largely in the hands of Australians settled there and of returned soldiers from Fiji, Australia and New Zealand.   The new duty, if persisted in, must have a disastrous effect on the banana industry of that colony and detrimentally affect the general trade between Fiji and Australia, the imports from which country in 1920 reached the value of 8-10,000L   The almost certain result would be the removal of the steamer Levuka from the regular Fiji-Sydney trade.   He should be obliged if.a strong representation were made in the proper quarter with a view to the removal or reduction of a duty which vitally affected one of the principal industries of that colony.EGYPT.Mr. GlarrchiWs Manchester Speech.. On 18th June the following telegram [No. 420] was sent from Cairo by Lord Allenby : I have (Pgr. omit) to-day&apos;s bag the full text of the speech delivered by Saad Zaghloul, on 14th instant, at a meeting convened by Prince Aziz Hassan to protest against Mr. Churchill&apos;s Manchester speech. Four thousand persons are stated to have been present. The speech was violent in tone, distinctly anti-British, and to a less degree xenophobe.To emphasize the inherent imperialism of Plis Majesty&apos;s Government, he quoted the following remark, which he stated Lord Milner had mane to him in London on 21st June .1920: &quot;We have been for a (? hundred) years trying to possess Egypt, and it is now in our hands, so we wish our position to be legal.&quot;Zaghloul added that these were Lord milner&apos;s very words.Speaking of Mr. ClnirchilPs statement that for the present the army of occupation must be retained in this country, he stated that, should, this lie insisted upon, Egyptians would believe that the presence of foreigners in Egypt was the cause of all the troubles of the Egyptian people, and that therefore it would be impossible that Egyptians and foreigners should live in peace together. This veiled threat to-foreigners has been reported to the British press by BeutePs local representative and the local correspondent of the Morning Post.The whole speech was punctuated with definite inciting remarks ; ho adjured his audience to remember they were not animals whose sons could be murdered while they paid ransom, and again that they were not living in a den but on the surface of the earth and should either be given their full rights or die.This meeting, as reported by Renter, was held at the house of Said Abdul Hamid el (? Adari), but neither he nor Sheikh Bekhit was present and both have since signed a manifesto supporting the official delegation.On the same day Lord Allenby reported [No. 419] that he had received a telegram from Prince Omar Toussoun containing the resolutions of a meeting held at Alexandria protesting against Mr. ChurchilPs recent speech and against entering into negotiations.PALESTINE.The Pope on Zionism. On 14ih June Count de Salis reported [No. IS] that at-a secret consistory held on the previous day the Pope had delivered an allocution to the cardinals dealing principally with Palestine.After remarks understood to refer only to-the activities of the American methodists, the Pope spoke of his satisfaction at the conquest of Palestine by Christian
troops. Since then his fears that the jews might obtain a privileged position had been realized; the situation of Christians was now worse than it used to be, and the present regime (it might be without the wish of its founders) tended to deprive Christians of the position they had hitherto held and to substitute jews. Much was being done to deprive the holy places of their sacred character and to mate them into pleasure resorts.The Pope  did not  desire that the .rights of the Jewish element should be. infringed, but that the just rights of Christians should not be subordinated&apos; to them. He therefore exhorted all Christian nations, catholic and other, to urge these con-siderations on the League of Nations, which had. to examine the terms of the British mandate.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.L.R., xlv, p. 4]. The reports received by the Viceroy as telegraphed [1014] by him on 16th dune are to the effect that sniping and attacks on pickets were continuing as usual in Waziristan, but that there had been no increase in the enemy&apos;s activity otherwise.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xlv, p. 4].-The Viceroy transmitted [809 S.] on 6tlt June a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs reporting a conference which he and his colleagues had held on 3rd June with Tarsi and other Afghan representatives. Sir Henry had informed the Afghans of the proposals sanctioned by the Secretary of. State in his telegram of 30th May. The Afghans replied that they had reconsidered the situation, but at the same time pointed out the loss of various benefits which they would incur by a rupture with Russia, which they would otherwise obtain immediately, whereas our offers were only contingent upon an attack by a third Power. Sir Henry then proposed to give certain telegraph materials and an initial sum of 10 lakhs, which would enable the Afghans to buy munitions, and suggested the possibility of supplying 12 aeroplanes, irrespective of Russian attack, if the friendship resulting from the signature of the treaty warranted it. These offers appeared to be sufficient to enable the Afghans to risk the cancellation of the treaty with Russia, and, to Sir Henry&apos;s surprise, Tarsi said that they saw no objection to the publication of the.complete details of the treaty.Tarsi was then asked as to his statement that if there was no treaty with Russia there would be no Russian legation at Kabul. He replied that this point had not escaped him, but that so long as there was no war with Russia, he believed she would claim to retain her legation. Sir Henry said that in view of the full information he had received regarding the bad faith of Russia, we could not be satisfied alone with the exclusion of consulates, and that the help indicated could only be given on the understanding that there would be no regular Russian legation at Kabul. The Afghans, however, remained firm on this point. After some argument, in which Tarsi anticipated a rupture with Russia and the withdrawal of her legation as a consequence of the elimination of the Eastern consulates, and notified the expectations of Afghanistan for some compensation for the loss of the advantages which had been promised by Russia, the meeting was adjourned until the following day.On 4th June, Sir Henry Dobbs reported the results of the meeting held that day. at which the same representatives had been present. After some discussion Sir Henry had made the following proposals : :1) If the Russian treaty was completely dropped, and the Russian Minister withdrawn, the assurances already given would, remain good, and the British Government would further give 40 lakhs of rupees, an initial grant of 10 lakhs, with the immediate supply of 160 miles of telegraph material for the ultimate connexion of Kabul with Herat via Kandahar, six aeroplanes and the gift of munitions already named contingent on an unprovoked attack by Russia. (2) If the important parts of the treaty with Russia were dropped, but the Russian Minister remained, and a purely commercial treaty with Russia was made, the British Government would give a subsidy of 35 lakhs of rupees, an initial grant of 10 lakhs, and telegraph material as in the first proposed. But as in this case there would be no apparent danger of war between Afghanistan and Russia, there, would be no assurance against unprovoked attack by Russia, and no gift of munitions contingent thereon.
r.......After consideration the Afghans responded, with the following proposals:  -Afghanistan would be prepared to effect an immediate break in relations with Russia, including the withdrawal of her Minister, if the British Government would promise the subsidy of 40 lakhs of rupees and make the gift of munitions immediate, with telegraph, material and six aeroplanes after six months. Further, the help of the British Government with money and munitions was to be forthcoming in the event of an unprovoked attack by Russia.Sir Henry Dobbs demurred to these proposals as being not unlikely to induce Afghanistan to adopt an aggressive attitude towards Russia with the ultimate possibility of dragging the British into war. Eventually Tarsi consented to place Sir Henry&apos;s proposals before the Amir. Sir Heury&apos;s oWn view of the situation was that we must either trust Afghanistan and secure her friendship, or refuse to trust her and lose it. .In view of the urgency of immediate action, the Viceroy, in consultation with the council, sent instructions to Sir Henry Dobbs to the following effect: They considered the Afghan demand for the immediate gift of munitions to be unduly&apos; high, and without wishing to fetter Sir Henry&apos;s discretion, suggested that he should try to reduce the quantity by half. Should he deem this impossible or inadvisable, they authorized him to close with the Afghan offer of a complete rupture of relations with Russia, including the withdrawal of her Minister, in return for which the British would provide a subsidy of 40 lakks, an immediate gift of 10,000 rifles and 100 Lewis guns (or double these quantities of arms, if absolutely- necessary), 12 mountain guns, and two batteries of IS-pounders, as well as six aeroplanes after six months, the telegraph material as proposed, of which 160 miles was to be immediate. Further than this was the promise of assistance with money, munitions and aeroplanes in the event of unprovoked aggression by Russia, as might be deemed, necessary by the two Governments in consultation.Telegraphing [840 S.] on 9th June, the Viceroy, impressed by the danger of leaving the Amir exposed to outside influence pending ratification, urged that ratification be dispensed with, and that Sir Henry Dobbs be authorized to sign the treaty finally.On 12th June the Viceroy transmitted [857 S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs in which he reported that Tarsi had sent to inform him that Afghanistan had finally decided to place her trust in British assurances and to break off political relations with Russia, which would be engineered over the Bokharan and Khivan questions. The Afghans desired to make it clear that the procedure would be conducted in four-stages : First, the signing of the British treaty; second, the delivery of munitions on the Indo-Afghan frontier; third, the transmission of these munitions to Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif; fourth, the rupture of political relations with Russia on the refusal, to sign a treaty with her. The Afghans were anxious to know if we would trust them so far as to deliver the munitions at once, and to accept their written promise of rupture with Russia which would be deferred until the munitions had been transported to the north.   Sir Henry asked for instructions.Referring to the above message, the Viceroy telegraphed [860 S.] on 13th June that the matter had been considered by him in Council that clay. Their opinion was that the Afghan proposals involved risks which they would not be justified in taking. At least six weeks would elapse before the munitions could arrive on the Afghan northern border, and this, with the proverbial inclination of the Afghans to procrastinate, would afford them opportunities of finding excuses to postpone the final break with Russia. In the view of the Council it was clearly desirable that the rupture with Russia should coincide as nearly as possible with the delivery of munitions on the Indo-Afghan frontier. They recommended the following procedure: First, the final conclusion and publication of the treaty; second, the delivery of munitions on the frontier; third, the open rupture of political relations with Russia -14 days after the second stage. The Council considered that immediate publication was essential on account of the wild rumours which would be certain to be aroused by the movement of munitions to the frontier.The Secretary of State replied [29S8] to this telegram on 16th June that he was greatly impressed by the objections to any interval between the delivery of munitions and the final break with Russia. After stating the various reasons which the British Government had taken into consideration, he informed the Viceroy that it appeared to them that it was highly desirable that not only the delivery of munitions and the break of relations with Russia, but also the signature and publication of the treaty 29-4 C
should take place at-one and the same time. The Secretary of State suggested that a. date might be fixed on which the whole transaction would be completed.The Vieerdy&apos;s- Weekly lieporl. The following telegram was sent on 9th JuneSection 1. Bengal. The coolie exodus from Assam has caused an anxious situation in Eastern Bengal, of which the non-co-opeiators have taken advantage. Sir Henry Wheeler proceeded to Chandpur, where there was complete hartal, for some days, with great inconvenience to the European population and to the loyal Indians.   There was a sympathetic hartal in Comilla, Dacca and Narainganj.Section 2. The necessary steps are being taken to prevent an outbreak of cholera, and an appeal has been issued to the Marwaris of Calcutta for funds.-The Bengal Government has issued a communique showing that the reports of the Chandpur occurrence had been greatly&apos; exaggerated. Abul Kalam. Azad announced that the only work to be performed in connexion with swaraj and the caliphate is to-go to jail without denmr, and that one lakh of prisoners is needed for the freedom of the country without delay.Bombay.- Reports from Si ml indicate a set-back in the non-co-operation campaign, hut the leaders are endeavouring to keep their popularity and the movement alive by creating an agitation against, officials, particularly the police. There is also an indication of increased activity amongst purely caliphate workers,, chiefly Mohamedans, whose feelings lean, towards Pan-Islamism and Vvahabisin.Section 4. Propagandists from the Aligarh National University have arrived in Sincl and more are expected from Bombay. The provincial caliphate committee is endeavouring, in consultation with Mohamed and Shaukat Ali, to arrange a caliphate conference in June at Karachi. In a speech at Bhusaval, Shaukat Ali declared that the three months ending August are to be spent in making final preparations,, namely, enlisting a crore of members and securing a crore of rupees towards swaraj.Section 5. United Provinces.-The excessive heat of Ramzan, and the alarm caused by Mohamed Ali&apos;s speech on an Afghan invasion and a steady policy of prosecution for seditious speeches. have temporarily reduced the obnoxious political activities. The position has improved in the Oudh districts, but there is little sign of a return to peace elsewhere. It is too early to attempt to estimate the effects of the announcement by the Ali brothers. There is a widespread incendiary campaign in -the hill forests. There is no evidence that there is any connexion between this and the non-co-operation movement.Punjab. Idie working element of the central Gurdwara committee has now become almost entirely extremist, though no definite line of policy 1ms been arrived at, and the Sikh agitators are generally reported to be in a state of disunion and vacillation. With regard to the general non-co-operation movement, reports from various districts indicate a general lull in the agitation, the movement is on the decline, getting little encouragement, and the same attention is not given to the paid agitators as formerly. The abnormal hot weather, the drought and Ramzan perhaps account for some lull in activity. In one or two places a desire has been manifested to-combat the activities of the non-co-operationists. Successful Liberal League meetings are being held in Ferozepore. Two Sikhs, apparently deserters from the 35th, were arrested at Lahore station, with revolvers and ammunition in their possession. The-information that they belong to a gang of four deputed to murder certain British and Indian officials has yet to be verified.Delhi. :The situation is quiet. The collection of members and funds for this year continues to hang fire. Among the Sikhs, the difference between the moderates and the extremists is growing more (? acute). The attendance at the independent national school is steadily falling. The chief commissioner has recommended the retention of the Seditious Meetings Act for a further period of (?six months) from 8th June, but in view of the quietness of the delegation and the absence of disorder, we have decided to let the Act lapse, at any rate for the present.Section G. Assam. The situation in Karimganj is quieter. The wide publication of the Bengal communique regarding the misapprehension as to the occurrence at Chandpur has had a good effect. The railway employees have returned to duty at Gauhati and Lumat. The total number of the coolies who have left the tea gardens is estimated to be about 6,000 or 7,000.&quot;&apos; Some gardens have lost all their labour,, others from 30 to 60 per cent.Bihar and Orissa.-Hassan Imam in an interview acknowledged that Lord (2helmsford&apos;s Government had stood by the Indian moslems&apos; cause faithfully, and that the Secretary of State had fought for the cause as few would have fought.   The
present Government equally do their best, and if the moslem demands are not con-ceded, it will not be- the fault of the Indian Government or oFthe Secretary of State.Section 7. The political situation is distinctly easier and there has been no important development.Burma. The conviction of Swaini barmanand had a quieting effect in Rangoon. There has been a recrudescence of the picketing of liquor shops by volunteers, but no violence.Section 8. Similar attempts in Mandalay were stopped by the district magistrate issuing an order under section 14-1, Criminal Procedure Code.Section 9. Central Provinces.-.-The&apos; district conference proved a failure, and generally throughout the province there has been a lull in political oratory, house-to-house propaganda taking its place. The picketing of liquor shops continues. Landowners are ranging themselves on the side of law and order.North-West Frontier Province. The students despatched by Mohamed Ah for propaganda work in this, province were given the option of furnishing security or voluntarily leaving. They chose the latter, and the action taken has been heartily&apos; welcomed by the loyal elements. There has been an attempt to resuscitate the caliphate agitation in Kohat, but in other districts there has been no caliphate or non-co-operation activity, and in. Dera Ismail Khan the leading hind us and mohamedans have suggested to the deputy commissioner, the formation of a Liberal League to counteract the pernicious political activity.Section 10. General. The Ali brothers&apos; statement, and the.communique issued by the Government of India ou it, have been well received in the press, and the Viceroy&apos;s conduct of the negotiations has been greatly appreciated. Mohamed Ali, speaking about the statement, said he was pledged to the cause of non-violent nou-&apos;co-operatiou which was salvation for India, and for that cause was ready even to apologize if in some quarters some passages in his speeches had given the impression of inciting to violence. :Section 11. On the whole, the situation shows improvement. Gandhi delivered a distinctly despondent speech at Bombay on 29th May, shortly after leaving Simla.Section 12. Pie told the audience that they had not adequately responded to the congress programme. If they failed to enlist a crore of members for the congress and to collect a crore of rupees by the end of Jane, they were unfit for swaraj and would not get it. The press committee has concluded its session and its report will be submitted in about a fortnight. The Indian press is jubilant at Thompson&apos;s vacating the chief secretaryship of the Punjab. The Viceroy&apos;s speech at the Chelmsford Club on 30th May, of which a summary was cabled by Reuters, was very well received by the press, both English and &quot;Indian, and has helped to maintain the calmer atmosphere now prevailing.THE DOMINIONS,The Imperial Conference.-M the opening meeting of the conference on Monday, 20th June, the following representatives were present:-- United Kingdom. Mr. Lloyd George; Mr. Austen Chamberlain; Air. A. J. Balfour; and Mr. Winston Churchill.Canada. Mr. Arthur Meighen, Prime Minister.Australia. Mr. W. M. Hughes, Prime Minister.. .New Zealand. Mr. W.

AUSTRALIA.    .The following items of information were telegraphed to the official secretary in Great Britain by the Prime Ministers department, Melbourne : Wool Sales. The wool sales have been resumed in Melbourne with a submission of 110,000 bales of the 1920-21 clip. The offerings embraced a proportion of merino from a wide range of districts including Queensland. The market was 5 per cent, to 10 per cent, better, and it is anticipated that the success of the opening sale will induce Bawra to approve of a material increase in the July allocation and thus dispose of the current clip before the arrival of the incoming clip.Sugar. Official returns state that on present indications the Queensland sugar crop will aggregate 250,000 tons. Superintendent Easterby is of opinion that it may not be necessary to import sugar to make up the slight deficiency between this supply and. the country&apos;s demand, as there is still remaining a balance from previous imports. At a meeting of fruit growers in Melbourne it was stated that arrangements had been completed whereby jam makers would be permitted to import their own sugar at the workPs parity. The Minister for Customs says he is not yet in a position to make an announcement.Reduction in Freights. Advices from Sydney indicate further reductions in oversea freights between New Zealand and England. Hemp which was recently reduced, from 15 guineas a ton to 10 guineas, has, it is stated, been further reduced to 61. 10s. pZws 10 per cent., while the rate on oats and peas has been reduced by 11. a ton.SOUTH AFRICA.Proposed Contribution to the Imperial Navy. Reuters agent telegraphed as follows from Cape Town on 7th June : At to-day&apos;s resumption of the debate in the Union House cf Assembly on the proposed contribution of 85,()00L to the imperial navy, Mr. Close, K.G., made a very strong appeal that a portion of this vote should be earmarked for the completion of the hyclrographical survey, embodying the fishery survey, so as to attract commercial trawlers in the production of fish and fish fertiliser supplies, to raise a local personnel and create a South African sea sense, thereby doing in some measure for the Union what the North Sea fishermen, had clone in the war. Mr. Close also urged the Govern-nient to submit the matter to the Admiralty with a view to procuring a suitable vessel or two as a local unit for hydrographical, coastal, and minesweeping work.Mr. Patrick Duncan, Minister for the Interior, replying to various speakers, expressed the opinion that a local South African navy was a thing of ,the future. He agreed that the amount could probably be spent to the greatest advantage for purposes, especially benefiting South Africa, and assured Mr. Close that the Govern-ment was fully alive to the importance of hydrographical and fishery surveys, and would make a move in the direction indicated by him.Telegraphing again on 10th June Reuter&apos;s agent reported that General Hertzog s amendment to delete the Union contribution had been defeated by 70 votes to 31.Four days later he again telegraphed saying:  The advisory fishery committee is pressing upon the Government the urgency of combining the fishery survey and the hydrographical survey under the naval contribution. The committee requests that the South African ministers in London should induce the Admiralty to earmark from the contribution a sufficient amount to permit of the carrying on of these surveys with two suitable vessels. The continuation of the fishery survey, it is urged, will mean the building up of a commercial and trawler fleet, which in time of emergency would provide the personnel and means of doing coastal patrol, minesweeping and the like services, as the North Sea trawlers did in the war, and would really become a small local naval unit, with invaluable local experience.Miners&apos; Wages. Reuter s Johannesburg agent telegraphed on 9th June that the joint executive of the trades unions had endorsed the resolution passed by the conference of trade union representatives on 6th June, to the effect that there wras no justification for the reduction of wages as proposed by the Chamber of Mines.
