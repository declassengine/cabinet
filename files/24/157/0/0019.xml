GREAT BRITAIN:Unemployment Situation. The following paragraph is taken from the report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending yth December :  There are still no signs of a general trade revival. Many firms are making arrangements for a prolonged holiday over Christmas and the New Year. Coal-mining shows little improvement generally, though the anthracite trade in South Wales is fairly brisk, and there has been some revival in Northumberland. Iron and steel remains very depressed; further discharges have taken place. Ship-building and marine engineering are at a standstill. In the textile, industry the depression, as far as cotton is concerned, continues; the improvement in the woollen and hosiery sections is maintained. General engineering remains extremely depressed, though a slight revival in the motor industry is recorded. The position in the boot and shoe industry has become worse. The improvement in the tinplate industry continues.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Sarwat Pasluis Programme for a New Ministry. On 12th December Lord Allenby sent [No. 665] the following telegram: I saw the Sultan yesterday morning, 11th December. His Highness confirmed the fact that Adly had resigned, but said that no decision had been taken as regards the formation of a new Ministry. He was seeing Sarwat Pasha that afternoon: Later in the day Sarwat Pasha called to see. me on his Highness&apos; instructions and submitted a programme on which he declared himself ready to take office.The following are the essential points of his proposed declaration of policy-:-L 1. Taking note in the memorandum of 10th November, which was handed to the official Egyptian delegation only, of the undertaking of the British Government to terminate the protectorate and to recognize Egypt as a sovereign State, and while -not being able to accept the memorandum or to recommend it to the acceptance of the country, the Ministry will (? group omitted) themselves henceforth-and in so doing will be helped by the attitude of the country to showing Great Britain that she has no need of the increase of, or the accumulation of, guarantees, seeing that the good faith of Egypt, and the interest which she has in respecting undertakings given, would, constitute the best and most effective of safeguards for British, and other foreign interests.2. To this end the Ministry rely not only upon the justice of the national cause, but also upon the equitable spirit of the British nation, and upon a just appreciation of the reciprocal interests of the two countries.3. The Ministry are persuaded that there will be no obstacle in the near future to restoring a normal regime in Egypt, which will permit of the granting of a constitution to the country, assuring an effective and, serious co-operation between the Government and the country&apos;s elected representatives. The Ministry intend forthwith, strengthened by approval of your Highness, to work out a scheme of, constitutional reform in order that in their political task they may rely upon a true national representation, and may bring to a successful issue a -whole series of urgent reforms which the moral and economic progress of the country demands. . .4. The Cabinet consider that the moment has come to re-establish the functions of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which circumstances of war temporarily suspended.5. Finally, realizing the responsibility of their task, the Ministry will devote themselves to taking up the burden and to directing the affairs of the country solely in national interests.6. The Ministry, knowing the intentions cherished by your Highness for the good of the country, do not doubt that they will find in your Highness a support for the carrying out of their programme : they also count on the confidence of the country to face a task of which they feel ali the difficulties.Telegraphing [No. 666] on the same date Lord Allenby said that, regarding the first point in this policy, Sarwat Pasha had explained that while not contemplating an immediate termination of the protectorate, he, had hopes that His M.ajesty&apos;s Goyernment would see their way to it in the near future.
Sarwat had expressed himself as confident of being able to. form.a Ministry, on, the basis of the above programme, but pointed out that it must have the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government before he could take office.Lord Allenby strongly recommended the acceptance of the programme.The Secretary of State telegraphed [No. 534] on loth December to Lord Allen by that he was authorized to give a general assent to the suggested programme.   .IRAQ,    -. ,Relations with Turkey.-On 13th December the High Commissioner telegraphed as follows: .      . .:. ,  .     . &apos;. ;     , .       .   ,. ..king Feisal states that, no negotiations are being carried oil by him with the Kenuilists,. and he.&apos;fully realizes that His Majesty&apos;s Government is averse from his entering into relations with them. A. letter has, however, recently been sent to him by his cousin Sherif-Jamil at Amman, suggesting that a certain Naji Bey, who has .a high position .with Mustafa Kemal, shouhl be approached. Naji Bey is related to King FeisaFs mother by marriage and is, King Feisal says, a trusty Hejaz friend of his own and a soldier of some repute. If there is no objection, he would like to write to him and ascertain privately what are Mustafa Kemabs intentions regarding Iraq. I should be glad if you would inform me by telegram whether His Majesty&apos;s Govern-xnent has any. objection to this proposal. In my opinion this opportunity of obtaining reliable, information should not.be. missed.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., Iviii, p. 4]. The Viceroy telegraphed [2101] on 7th December &quot;that according to reports received from Waziristan. the situation was then normal. The, Wana. column had been engaged in a small action in the-first stage of its. withdrawal from Wana, which took place on 1st December. No further incidents had occurred rip to the arrival of the:column at Sarwekai:.. From Baluchistan a revised casualty list of the Bashore Valley raid had been received showing : Killed, 2 British officers, 40 Indian other ranks.&apos; Wounded, 2 Indian officers, 17 Indian other ranks. Of the 21 prisoners, 11 had died as prisoners and the remainder had been released.Mission to-Kabul [B.-E.R.; Iviii, p. 4J- On 30th November the Aficeroy reported [2715 S.] that he had telegraphed to Sir Henry Dobbs his satisfaction with the messages received from him, but laying stress On the importance of getting the undertaking regarding Arnawai in writing. Sir-Henry had been instructed also to telegraph the official reply to his representations concerning the Waziri incursion-, and further to convey a message of sympathy to the Amir on his indisposition.A message from Sir Henry was transmitted [2725 S.] by the Viceroy on 1st December, announcing the receipt of a letter from Tarsi, expressing his own deep regret and the genuine horror of the Amir at the outrage. Tarsi had said that he was unable to write officially that it was his intention to remove the Waziri colony from Shahjui, but that that certainly would be done. On seeing, the Amir, whose illness was understood to be a severe quinsy, Sir Henry received his assurance,, in a feeble voice, that he would keep his kingly word and remain steadfast in his policy of friendship with Great Britain. The atmosphere at that time had been extraordinarily friendly, and appearances at least were very hopeful.Sir Henry Dobbs reported by telegram, transmitted [2758 S.] by the Viceroy on 5th December, that Tarsfs promised official letter had been delivered to him on the morning of 2nd December, as he was actually starting. The letter officially confirmed the decision of the Afghan Government to evacuate Arnawai. The representative of the Afghan Foreign Office, who accompanied Sir Henry to the frontier, had assured him that the withdrawal of Afghan troops had already taken place.Exchange of Ministers [B.E.R., Iviii, p. 5]. With reference to Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; message transmitted [20(31 S.] on 25th November, the Viceroy telegraphed [271(3 S.] on 30th November that it appeared certain that the Amir would not withdraw his objections to the appointment of Mr. Fears, and that it was desirable that the matter should be settled before Sir Henry left Kabul. He recommended the selection of Mr. Humphreys as the next best that could be made, as it was believed that he wotdd be persona grata as a Minister.
Telegraphing [2742 S.] on 2nd Deceinbeivflie Viceroy transmitted a report from Sir Henry Dobbs to the effect that the appointment or Mi-. Humphreys would afford the Afghan Government the greatest satisfaction, and that they awaited the official intimation from the British Foreign Office. They hoped for the arrival of the British Minister as early as possible, and were indifferent as to his arrival in Kabul preceding that of the Afghan Minister in London. The appointment of the latter had. not then been decided on, but Sir Henry thought that in all probability it would be-Mohamed Wall.The Viceroy&apos;$ Report. The following telegram was sent oil 6ih December:   Madras. Except in a few definite areas, the situation remains quiet. The main theatres of political, activity are now Ganjain, Auantapur, North Arcot, Madura, Vizagapatam and Guntur. Interest is mainly foeussed on the trials of the various local agitators. - Agitation for civil disobedience is stated to be rising into prominence,, apparently in the hope that the authorities would provoke a crisis by repressive measures. This, however, was written before the repercussion of the Bombay events;. and even, then there were signs of a considerable body of opposition to civil dis-bbedience. The temperance agitation&apos;is subsiding. Action under the preventive sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure is now being taken freely wherever the situation requires it, and, in spite of temporary outbursts of excitement and hartals, the prosecutions have, on the whole, had most satisfactory results.Section 2. The situation in the Madras mill area is now satisfactory. 2,500* strikers have been taken back to work, and only a few of those for whom no work, could be found are still causing trouble. Relations between the caste hind us and the Adi Dravidas are reported to be much improved. The judge&apos;s summing up to the jury in the case of the Ali brothers has been translated into Siudi and distributed broadcast; the effect, is reported to have been good. The situation in Dharwar has much improved as a result of the sentences in the riot case.Section o. Bengal. -The revival of extremist activity led to various disturbances,, and culminated in a declaration, of complete hartal on 17th November. Mohammedan feeling is becoming more adverse to the Government. The ordinary maulvies and mullahs, who formerly held aloof from politics, have recently been drawn into the boycott movement. Several branch caliphate committees have been formed, and the enrolment of volunteers continues, but appeals for subscriptions to the funds meet with little success. The boycott of foreign cloth has lost much of its original attraction. In a few cases dealers have obtained protection. The activities of the non-co-operators in Mofassil have been directed mainly to the obstruction of settlement operations and the spread of discontent among the chowkidars. Attempts are being-made in Midnapur to induce people to refrain from paying the chowkidari taxes, and in some places the payment of the chowkidari is badly in arrears. In Midnapur the machinery of local self-government appears to be breaking down owing to the combined opposition to the payment of the union board rates.Section 4.   The situation   is receiving the earnest attention of the local Government.Section 5. The local Government, summarizing the situation describes the first fortnight of November as one of steady deterioration culminating in the undoubted success caused by the (? non-) co-operators in Calcutta in the complete hartal on the 17th, which was brought about by wholesale intimidation. Instances of molestation and the threatening of ordinary passers-by were numerous. Universal and adequate police protection cannot be guaranteed in a city of the size of Calcutta, and a single constable is liable to be terrorized and to hesitate to act. There are, in fact, most unsatisfactory signs that the moral of the police has been impaired, while that of the town has been badly shaken. The elements of disorder are greatly elated, but the average citizen is resentful of what appears to him to be the inaction of the Govern-ment. It is now clear that the non-co-operation movement has built up an organization of very real power, and that it will be necessary to break this if decent administration is to be restored. It is becoming more and more evident that ordinary public opinion will be unequal to the task unless aided by a strong lead from the Government, In Mofassil, the events at Howrah, Midnapur and elsewhere are evidence of active-defiance of law and order which contains serious potentialities. Since the above was received, the local Government has proclaimed all volunteer associations under Act 14 of 190S. We are further sanctioning the application of the Seditious ^Meetings Act to Howrah, and are awaiting a communication from the Bengal Government regarding the strength of the Calcutta garrison.
United Provinces. The situation, both amongst the rural population and in the towns, is quieter. The cult of Gandhiism is for the moment on the wane, but the caliphate side of the movement is increasing in violence, both above and below the surface. Persistent efforts to seduce the police, and in some degree the army, from their duty continue, The total number of resignations from the police is 37, nearly all mohammedans. The present, however, is always a season of slack recruitment, and vacancies in the police are few compared with the state of affairs obtaining before the new rates of pay were sanctioned. Organization of the efforts to induce resignations amongst Government servants is taking concrete shape in anonymous letters and postcards, which are reported in some numbers. *Section 6. The provincial congress committee, at the meeting of 25th November, passed the following resolutions : (a) Congratulating the people on the peaceful aud voluntary observance of hartal on 17th. November, and hoping that similar hartals would be observed peacefully and voluntarily in every town and province on the day of the Prince of Wales&apos; visit to that town.(6) Appointing a provincial volunteer board, consisting of Jahawir Lai Nehru, two other hindus, and two mohammedans, and. calling on all the district congress committees to organize new volunteer corps, and also to reorganize the old. corps so as to comply with the directions of the working-committee.(o) Stating that, in the opinion of the committee, the time has come to start civil disobedience in the province in a restricted form, the provincial executive council to decide which of the laws and orders of the Government should be chosen for the- purpose of civil disobedience; no town or district to resort to disobedience without permission of the executive council.(d) The town congress committees of Lucknow, Allahabad, and Benares were authorized to arrange for hartals on the occasion of the Prince&apos;s visit. The local Government has proclaimed all volunteer associations under Act 14 of 1908.Section 7. The threat of civil disobedience in the restricted form need not, on present information be taken very seriously, and we have full confidence that the local Government will do all possible to counter attempts at hartal on the occasion of the Prince&apos;s visit, should these, which is doubtful, be pushed at all vigorously.Punjab.- Activity on the part of the non-co-operators, the congress, caliphate and akali movements continues. They were stimulated by the visit of Gandhi to Lahore early in the month. In Lahore and Amritsar, caliphate volunteers have been much in evidence, parading the streets and singing seditious songs. It is not likely that civil disobedience will be taken up in the province (sic ? firmly), though in some parts people are said to be preparing themselves for such an event. The preaching of disobedience at meetings in the villages in the Lahore district has had an effect of increasing the natural tendency to break the ordinary law. The akali movement shows no signs of subsiding, though there is some dissension between the Sikh non-co-operators and some of the jatha leaders. In the majority of cases the jathas are reported to be amenable to reason and very suspicious of the hindu and mohammedan extremists. At two Sikh meetings in the Lahore district the public were advised not to pay taxes. Speakers are being proceeded against. On the 26th November the district magistrate arrested 12 leading Sikh non-co-operators for defiance of the Seditious Meetings Act, but a telegram j ust received shows that Amritsar is quiet, and that civil disobedience on a large scale is unlikely. The volunteers are discarding their uniforms. The proclamation of the akali dal as an unlawful association is under consideration.  .Section 8. The municipal committee of Lahore has recently, by the casting vote of the official president, rescinded the resolution declining to present an address of welcome to the Prince of Wales.Section 9. Bihar. The looting and burning of the Chautarwa factory in the Champa-ran district, by a mob of 5,000 persons, has caused considerable alarm in Tirhoot. Since the police investigation started, the rioters have dispersed and are now scattered all over the district endeavouring to stir up trouble in other areas in the hope of diverting attention from their own crimes. Threatening letters have been received by many planters and loyal Indiaus. The armed police force in the district has been reinforced aud the district has been notified under section 1.5 of the Police Act.   The commissioner has applied that the Tirhoot division should be proclaimed35-3 B
under the Seditious Meetings Act, :hu,t,the local Government have not yet. come to a decision on this. Considerable exoitment also prevails in. the northern part of inozufferpur. Large caliphate meetings have been held at numerous places in the Tirhoot,division addressed by outside orators, whose inflammatory speeches are said to have produced a profound impression on the audience. Cavalry have, been despatched to Mozufferpur; police forces have been strengthened, and the: local Government consider there is now no immediate cause for anxiety. They are also taking up the question of grazing rights, which was the. immediate or a contributory cause.of .the unrest. In,other parts of the province the general situation is said to be satisfactory. The meeting of the trade union congress at Jharriah on the 30th is giving rise to anxiety. ,  .Central Provinces. Political meetings are increasing, particularly in the, towns, the speeches often taking a definitely religious turn. The proscribed fatwa is freely circulated. Numerous meetings have been held, particularly in Nagpur, in support of the boycott of the Prince&apos;s visit. Speeches have in some cases taken a violent turn and a few prosecutions have been instituted. The habit is also growing of abusing public servants present at meetings. The provincial congress committee decided to take no action to start civil disobedience until,the result of gandhis measures in Gujarat is known. In the Wardha district some 500 names of volunteers for civil disobedience have been registered. All this, however,-was before the Bombay events and Gandhi&apos;s declaration. The split between the Tilakites and Gandhi&apos;s party at a conference at Berar almost led to blows;, but it is doubtful if the Tilakites will completely breakaway from Gandhi. The boycott of foreign cloth is declining in popularity.Section 10. Assam.-Some non-co-operation activity is. reported from the upper part of the Assam valley. In Sibsagar proceedings have, been necessary against a number of agitators, including a party of mohammedans who made inflammatory caliphate speeches.. In the rest of the Assam valley less activity is, reported. In Sylhet, proceedings are being taken against most objectionable agitators. disturbance-bances occurred on the 5th November at the Arunabimd tea garden, Cachar, in which both the manager and the deputy commissioner were assaulted, but not seriously injured. There have been a few rumours and threats of disturbances in some of the Tezpur gardens, but these have not materialized, and the gardens are rapidly settling down to normal conditions. The local Government has decided to appoint immediately a representative committee to enquire into the conditions of labour on the tea gardens throughout, the province, with special reference to the sufficiency of: wages. The volunteer associations have been proclaimed as unlawful.North-West [frontier Province. The situation is satisfactory in the main, though there is some evidence of unrest. The chief commissioner was well received everywhere in the pJera Ismail Khan and Bannu districts.Section 11. . General.-The general effect of the recent happenings, in particular the rioting, at Bombay and the manifestations of intimidation, &amp;c, at Calcutta and elsewhere, has been to strengthen the position of the Government vis-a-vis the respectable middle-class elements. The action taken against the volunteers and the announcement of policy made on Saturday by, the Viceroy, in reply to the Punjab chamber of commerce, are apparently meeting with much more favour, or at any rate Jess hostile reception, than would -otherwise have, been the case, and the non-co-operation movement has undoubtedly experienced something of a set-back.The caliphate, agitation remains our principal source of anxiety, and is likely to become more virulent. and dangerous unless something can be done to allay mohammedan feeling over Turkey.   A satisfactory announcement on this subject would ,. have a very great effect for good on the whole political situation.THE DOMINIONS.Air Communications Committee.-The following telegram, was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa on .13th December : The Air, Council represent that there will be great difficulty in preparing the Air estimates for 1922-23 in the absence of a decision by the Dominion Governments on
the report of the Air Communications-Committee, and are anxious to have by the end of December a forecast at, any rate of the probable decision. The Air Council have asked me to obtain the expression of your Ministers&apos; views.A US IT i, A Li A.Migration [ILL.lb, Iviii, p. 6].  The following telegram from the Governor General was received by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 1:9th December :  &apos;With reference to your telegram regarding migration, you- correctly interpret the proposal in my telegram of 24th November, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should, contribute half interest: on loan instalments for live years.Pacific Gable. The Governor-General reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 19th December that his Government agreed to the proposal for duplication, leaving the question of the route to be settled by their representative in London.Wireless Scheme:-The following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General on .1-0 tli: December: It is reported in the press that the Commonwealth Parliament has referred to a. joint committee of both Houses two proposals &quot;of private companies for direct wireless communication between. Australia and the United- Kingdom.;.His Maj.esty&apos;s Government earnestly hope that the Commonwealth Government will defer their decision on these schemes pending the consideration of the report of the wireless telegraphy commission, which has been just completed and will be sent to you within the-next.few days-.As the present policy here is to maintain, imperial wireless communications in the hands of the Government,&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Government would be considerably embarrassed by an application from a private company for the erection, of a special station in this country for direct communication- with, the Australian station. On the other hand,, if it were found necessary to refuse a. licence to a private company His Majesty&apos;s Government might find it difficult for themselves to erect a corresponding&apos; station here in addition to the imperial chain station. Their experts are confident that the thermionic valve stations proposed for the chain would be powerful enough to ensure direct communication between the United Kingdom and Australia for several, hours per diem.Should your Ministers desire further information.as to the position, His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladly arrange for a discussion between the wireless telegraphy commission and&apos;any. experts&apos;.nominated by the Commonwealth Government.Butter. Oil- 19thDecember the Governor-General&apos; telegraphed to-the Secretary of State for the Colonies, transmitting the following message from his Prime Minister ;-The High Commissioner for Australia reports&apos; that the Board of Trade-proposes im mediately to dispose of the stock of. Australia and New Zealand, butter; amounting to in all 84O;O(:)0 cases. As this will, have a disastrous effectouthemarket and is a matter of the greatest: importance to Australia, I am calling: the Cabinet1 together immediately to- discuss the position, Meantime I urge that no action may lie taken until the Government has had:opportunity to express their views.In.reply to this, the Secretary, of State telegraphed next day to the Governor-General as followsThe principal importers have proposed&apos;a scheme to the Board of Trade for bulk purchase by them, in association with the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments, of the stocks of butter remaining at the end of the year, which would enable the buyers to control, disposal1 and&apos; stabilize prices. I understand that the proposals have been already communicated to your Prime Minister. Failing a- sale&apos;in. bulk on the basis of this scheme or otherwise, the Board of Trade-think it essential to complete by about the end of March, next the placing on the-market of their old season&apos;s stock now in store at such prices as the market may afford. Competition with.free goods is regarded as certain to bringdown.themaiFet prices to-approximately the pre-war level, if not lower, jn,the industrial conditions now prevailing. The. bulk sale will.not be concluded during the next seven clays, thus affording an opportunity to your Government to express its views. The Board of Trade inform me, however, that they feel compelled to reduce their present selling prices, which are now above 35-3 - 0
the current market price, after the close of business to-morrow, Wednesday, night. The present stocks of Australian and New Zealand are approximately 750,000 boxes, of which about 480,000 are Australian.New Cabinet.

Government of their profound sense of gratitude and congratulations on. the Irish settlement. -    - . &apos;Queensland.Irish Agreement.  On 14th December the Governor telegraphed to the Secretary ;of State for the Colonies that he had been asked to convey to His. Majesty the King the grateful expression of the, Queensland Irish Association^ intense pleasure and &quot;satisfaction that with His Majesty&apos;,? approbation and assistance IrelancFs long sought right to self rule had been won, and their confident, belief that this great achievement would ensure the happiness and -welfare of Ireland and promote; the prosperity and &apos;stability of the Empire.       - , .-,Miscellaneous. The following items of information were issued from the office of the High Commissioner in London on 19th December:  Improved Export Trade. Australian -trade with overseas countries during the first four months of the current financial year has left a favourable balance of 7,300,0002. This indicates that the exports from the Commonwealth in that period were valued at that much more than the imports. Australian financial authorities welcome the surplus as helping to satisfy the interest bill in London.Sydney Wool Sales.-The recent Sydney wool sales have been strong, with all-round competition. The market showed a 5 to 10 per cent, advance on the November rates for merinos, except broad-haired fleece wools. Comebacks were 5 per cent, /and crossbreds 10 to 15 per cent, higher. Medium crossbreds had an improving sale, but very coarse crossbreds a difficult- one. This activity of demand for good wool has been more marked since it was estimated that the production of the current season would give an increase of 770,000 bales over the previous clip.Tasmanian Butter Export.-The first direct shipment of Tamar River Tasmanian butter has been loaded, on the Commonwealth, steamer Barambali. It amounts to close on 4,000.boxes. .Industrial Qrowtli. Recent official statistics show a ,marked, industrial activity in Australia. In the State of Victoria the manufacturing output of the past year was valued at over 106,000,0002. The wages paid to males aggregated 17,600,0002. and to females 3,700,0002. &apos;
Victoria&apos;s Loan for Electricity Scheme. The Victorian Parliament has authorized the raising of a loan of 2,006,0001. for the purposes of the Morwell power works of the State electricity commission.The &quot; Moreton Bay.&quot;&apos; The general manager of the Commonwealth Government, shipping line reports that the Moreton Bay, first of the new fleet of government-owned steamers providing a fast service between England and Australia, which left London on 7th December carrying a full complement of lirst-class passengers and 700 immigrants, has arrived at Port Said (non-stop from Tiloury) 12 hours ahead of schedule time. The average speed - made was over 16 knots, and the passengers aboard have expressed their warm appreciation both of the comfort of the accom-modation provided on these new steamers and of the steadiness at sea of the Moreton Bay.&apos;NEW ZEALAND.Irish Aqreement.-^-0\\&apos; Sth December the Governor-General telegraphed  the following message for His Majesty the King:-  ,       .New Zealand has received with intense satisfaction the news that an agreement in the Irish negotiations has been reached. On behalf of the Government and people of this Dominion may I venture to express to your Majesty our loyal and respectful, congratulations on the accomplishment of this most difficult task.Aland-Islands.  On 6th December the Governor-General telegraphed that the Government of New Zealand agreed to the ratification of the Aland Islands convention by His Majesty. ...Butter. On 20th.December the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows : My Government has been advised by the High Commissioner for New Zealand that His Majesty&apos;? Treasury has notified the Board of Trade that its remaining stocks of butter must be immediately realized. The Board of Trade is stated to be willing to sell these stocks, consisting of approximately 8,000 tons New Zealand and 14,000 tons of Australian butter,&apos;at an exceedingly low price. If this is done, it must have the.effect of so&apos;depreciating the market values&apos;that New Zealand producers will suffer most heavily and the result to the Dominion will be very serious. The Prime Minister therefore most earnestly requests that action by the Board of Trade may be delayed until the Government of New Zealand can be enabled to go thoroughly into the matter.. The position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in holding these large stocks and its desire to liquidate them is fully realized by my Government, but the seriousness of the consequence which must follow if the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government are at once given effect to is such that Ministers feel it urgently necessary to ask that sufficient time be allowed to enable them to consider proposals for meeting the situation.To this a reply was sent on the same day identical in terms with that sent to the Governor-General of Australia (p. 7).SOUTH AFRICA,Aland Islands.- On 17th December the Governor-General reported that his Ministers agreed to His Majesty&apos;s. ratification, of the convention providing for the neutralization of the Aland Islands-. &apos;&apos;-..-The following paragraphs were telegraphed by ReuteFs agents :  Unemployment.-A conference between the Chamber of Mines and the workers&apos; leaders is expected to take place - here shortly, with a view to saving the mining-industry from a curtailment of operations, which would be disastrous to Johannesburg and the Reef, ,The main points for consideration are :   (1) The revision of the contract system. (2) The abolition of the status quo agreement. (3) The removal of trade union restrictions.        - .Of these points, the one to which the European workers are likely to attach most importance is the question of the status quo agreement. This was arrived at some years ago in connexion with those classes of work which were performed in some cases by coloured labour and in others by European labour, the terms of the agreement
being -that- where whites were engaged they were not to be replaced by coloured merit arid vt.ce verm.       .        ... -.It is contended that the termination of this agreement will not affect skilled and efficient whites, though it is admitted that the abolition, will affect the unskilled and inefficient.It is stated, however, that much of the present unemployment is due to workers, both skilled and unskilled, being thrown out of work by the closing down of mines,, and the problem to-day seems to be whether 60 per cent, of the mines, should close or whether everyone should co-operate in securing that the mines shall provide-employ-ment, the efforts of all parties being directed in reducing the possible hardships of reorganization to the lowest possible limit. The employers feel that the difficulty will be to get the question of abolishing the status quo agreement considered on.its merits,, as it undoubtedly touches the fringe of the colour question. [Johannesburg, 6th&apos; December.]Defence Force.-Owing to the serious financial condition, the Union Government has been obliged to hold in abeyance the proposals formulated for the creation of a small permanent force and the full resumption in 1922-23. of the citizen, force-training system provided by the South African Defence Act. : While adequate provision, will, be made for fulfilling- the responsibility of garrisoning the Cape peninsula which the Union assumed from 1st December, the permanent force, Including^ the air force, will for the time being be considerably smaller than was contemplated 12 months ago. Inter alia, four temporary brigadier-generals,. 36 other officers of the permanent staff, and some N.C.O.&apos;s are to be retired. Further retirements of a few officers, warrant officers and N.O.O.&apos;s will probably be necessary, and other economies, such as part-time employment for inspecting officers, will also be effected., -[Pretoria, 13th December.]Trade Commissioner. The appointment of Mr. Karl Spilhaus as South African Trade Commissioner for northern and western Europe has aroused considerable opposition in South Africa on the ground that he was during the war a German subject and was only naturalized last year.   [Capetown,. 1.3th.December.]..Irish Agreement. The terms of the Irish agreement have given enormous satisfaction throughout the Union, and-particular satisfaction is ftlt in-every provinee-that General Sjnutsds entitled to a, share in the credit-for the settlement between-the Cabinet and Sinn Fein. Telegrams have- been received&apos; from various&apos; centres, including the smaller Dutch townships, asking the Prime Minister to convey their congratulations to Mr. Lloyd;George-and at the;same time praising General Smuts for the part he took in the settlement during his stay in England; [Capetown,. 8th December.]Washington Conference. In the course of a speech delivered at Wiuburg, General Smuts said he had not expected, that South Africa would be invited to take part in the Washington conference because she was not directly affected like Canada,. New Zealand and Australia, lie had taken up the attitude that unless South Africa could, attend the conference on her own legs and not as part of the British Empire, engineered from London, they would not participate at all. His protest had been taken up by the British Government with far-reaching results, for the other Dominions were- to-day attending the conference, not as British Empire delegates, but as repre-sentatives of their separate Dominions. South Africa, too, would not be regarded&apos;now at Washington in a lesser degree than that which had been acknowledged at Paris by all the Powers, except America, and would.be represented. by the chairman of the British delegation, as there had been no time to send a delegate from here. General Smuts said his object had been achieved; and, any treaty to be made at Washington would be signed on behalf of South Africa oil an, equal footing, with: all&apos; the - other-nations, lie admitted that America&apos;s attitude at first tarnished South Africans-status, but that had now been righted. What had now been brought: about was largely clue to his efforts on behalf of South Africa and the other, portions of the Empire. South Africa, he added, could&apos; only become a great country by its status being acknowledged, as it now was, and not by big talk about independence and secession.   [Bloemfontein, 8th December.]Washington Conference. On. 10th-. December the Governor-General reported that he had approved an order of the Executive Council asking. His Majesty to issue letters patent appointing Mr. Balfour commissioner -and. plenipotentiary in respect of the Union of South Africa.
