GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 23rd August: -Survey of the Labour Situation. Several important trade union conferences have been held during the week. In the addresses at these conferences. the waning faith of labour in the strike weapon was further demonstrated.The Triple Alliance did not attract the attention that was expected at the annual conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, although the Executive committee&apos;s report was a practical confession of the impotence of the Alliance. Mr. Herbert Smith made a very frank avowal of the unwisdom of many features of the miners&apos; policy up to and during the recent stoppage, and the Executive 06m-mittee&apos;s. report revealed that it was the political implications of the National Pool that prevented the railwaymen and transport workers from joining the miners. The strictly industrial resolutions passed were noticeably mild, a number of &quot; advanced &quot; resolutions being shelved.Dissatisfaction with the policy of the Miners&apos; Federation has resulted in a proposal of the National Federation of Colliery Surfacemen to secede from that body.The settlement of the shipyard joiners&apos; dispute leaves the industrial held clear of important strikes. The situation in the chemical trade, however, is causing some anxiety, and unless an agreement is effected a stoppage of some 30,000 workpeople is likely next week.The* slow improvement in the unemployment position is maintained. The estimated total of the live register of all Employment Exchanges on the 19th August was 1,640,600 as compared with 1,685,500, the estimated number on the 12th August, and with 1,615,000, the corresponding figure for the first week of the recent dispute.At the final meeting of the Agricultural Wages Board held on 23rd August the proposed reduction- in wages of 6s. a week, with a minimum of 42s. a week, was confirmed.Manifesto on Trade Union Policy. A manifesto has been published addressed to organized Labour in this country and signed by 17 members of Parliament, among whom are the Right Hon, G. N. Barnes, the Right. Hon. G. H. Roberts, Sir Fortescue Flannery, and several prominent members of the National Democratic and Labour Party. The signatories consider that &quot; one of the greatest paradoxes of the time is that, owing to the activity of a small minority within the trade union move-ment, the word.&apos; trade-unionism &apos; is coming to have a significance which is far from being desired by the rank and file,&quot; who are not in favour either of a policy of &quot; direct action &quot; or an economic revolution. They exhort the workers to realize the futility and danger of &quot; prolonged strike action,&quot; and to look to a policy of increased production in industry, the development of foreign trade, and reliance on consti-tutional Parliamentary action for the advancement of their welfare. By these means, the ruin of industry, and the clanger to the nation from the spread of subversive doctrines may be averted.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.ADEN.Relations with the Imam. On 22nd August the Resident at Aden sent the following telegram [No. 6, 0, 21] to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : Colonel Lawrence, who arrived here on 18th August, saw the Imam&apos;s envoy Arashi, who was on the way to Mecca, at Jedclah. He visited Lahej yesterday and had two long conversations with the Sultan.The future relations with the Imam have been discussed by Lawrence and me, and we agree that our next move should be to send him a present in return for those which he sent here. It is most desirable that, as soon as possible, we should send to Sanaa a well-informed reliable mohammedan, who would be able to educate the Imam as regards affairs outside Arabia, and enable him to realize the advantages of making
terms. For this purpose the Sultan of Lahej can recommend a reliable member of his-household, and a suitable reason for sending him would be for the delivery of our present to the Imam, as it is desirable that this should be done by our own man.Conversations between the Imam and the messenger would, we hope, lead to an. invitation for a British officer, to visit Sanaa. If invited by the Imam it would be safe for him to consider^ and he would be our mediator in making, the final terms. In view of the great importance of creating a good impression, I suggest that the present we send, which should be of higher value than the total of those received, and one suitable for the occasion, should be a Ford motor, and we have every reason to believe that this would be appreciated. A Ford motor can be obtained here for about Rs. 3,100, and we agree that the present should be despatched as soon as possible.PALESTINE.Press Censorslrip. The following telegram [No. 338] was sent by the High Commissioner of Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 25thAugust: Instructions have been issued for the removal, as from 1st September, of the press censorship.   This refers to your confidential despatch of 11th August.MESOPOTAMIA.Jiulership of Iraq. The&apos; High Commissioner of Mesopotamia telegraphed [No. 409] to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 19th August, as follows : The result of the referendum carried out to ascertain the wishes of the people of Iraq, with reference to the candidature of Feisal, is an overwhelming majority in his favour. In an electorate of about 1,000,000, the votes represent a proportion of 96 per cent, for Feisal,. and 4 per cent, against. The ceremony of his accession is arranged for 23rd August.Relations with Ibn Saud.-The following message [No. 414], dated 22nd August, from the High Commissioner was received by the Secretary of State on 24th&apos; August: I have now received Ibn Saud&apos;s replies dated 21st June to my long letter of 4th May. The death of the courier on the way, and the consequent return of letters to Riyadh, have been the cause of the delay. Other letters of subsequent date on various current issues have also come to hand. The collective purport of them is most satisfactory. Feisal has also received a friendly letter with which he is pleased. In his recent public announcements, according to first-hand reports which have recently reached us, and in all his written communications he makes clear his obligations to Great Britain for their assistance in the past and his steadfast reliance on his friend-ship with us in the future. His replies on matters of interest to His Majesty&apos;s Government are summarized below : (1) Regarding the choice of a ruler for Iraq, he accepts the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the, people of Iraq, and expresses his desire, so long as. certain fundamental principles are observed, to have friendly relations with Iraq.(2) He accepts with thanks and dignity the financial assistance decided upon, but as his financial position is so difficult he naturally wishes it could have been more.(3) In regard to his assumption of the royal title, he offers his grateful acknow-ledgments for our attitude.(4) Regarding the Ivoweit boundary, he accepts our definition as regards the red circle, but as regards the zone between the red and the green circles, says no issue now arises, as the Sheikh of Koweit came to a satisfactory modus vivendi with him at his meeting with him at Riyadh at the time of Salim&apos;s death. Ultimately he will claim that this zone is Nejd territory.(5) As regards the pilgrimage, he again forbade it at our instance at the cost of great difficulty to himself vis-a-vis his subjects.(6) He gives assurances of necessary assistance to (&apos;? group omitted)s.(7) On the question of Khurmah and Turabah, he expresses his readiness to accept a settlement on a basis of autonomy under a Governor chosen by the inhabitants.
INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., 1, p. 4].-Telegraphing [1562] on 25th August the Viceroy reported that minor activities continued in Waziristan, but that the maintenance of communication had been rendered difficult by the continual rainfall.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., 1, p. 4], Referring to his telegram [1947 S.] of 13th August, the Viceroy stated, in a telegram [1955 S.], elated 14th August, that the Government of India did not endorse Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; suggestion that an increased offer of ammunition might turn the scale. They recommended, however, that, if Sir Henry thought it worth while to utilize this inducement at the present stage, he should have discretion to do so.   The Viceroy&apos;s military advisers agreed in this.On 16th August, the Secretary of State, referring to the telegrams received from, the Viceroy from 11th to 14th August, telegraphed [4177] to the Viceroy explaining the difficulties with which he found himself faced regarding the Viceroy&apos;s desire that the Cabinet should be now asked to approve the pis alter treaty. The first obstacle which presented itself was the outrage committed by the Afghans on Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; mail. Such an outrage, if committed by a civilized Power, would be followed by a rupture of relations, and Sir Henry might well hint that a Government which based enormous claims on its presumed equality with civilized Powers might possibly expect the same consequences. Secondly, this act threw a light on Afghan good faith and trustworthiness which would rudely shake any confidence in the honest intention of the Afghans to carry out the terms of any treaty. As regarded the amended draft, it was unlikely that Iiis Majesty&apos;s Government would forgo their demand for the disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty, which they looked on as an essential test of Afghan good faith. Next, as regarded consulates, no safeguard whatever seemed to be afforded, by the clause as re-drafted, and it certainly was not worth paying for. Further, if the Afghans were ready to give us a letter about Russia, they either believed that they could get the Bolshevik treaty altered, or were ready to violate it, which further reduced confidence in their honesty. Then, as regarded the apparent disposition of the Government of India to increase the subsidy, although less in return would be received, notwithstanding the hold which a subsidy would give, the Afghans were not likely to be less deterred from breaking a treaty by the loss of 20 lakhs than they would be by the loss of 25 lakhs. Rerhaps the greatest difficulty of all was the disappearance, after 30 years&apos; duration, of the Afghan undertaking to abstain from interference with the tribes.   This would&apos; (8) Relations with the Hejaz. In this matter he says we must either leave him a free hand to deal with it, or, if we insist on his reconciliation, we must prescribe terms and enforce their observance. Otherwise, if he is expected to be reconciled, the preservation of friendly relations by him thereafter will only be possible by his acquiescing in Sheriffian policy contrary to our interests and, therefore, against his own conscience.KENYA COLONY.The Indian Question [B.E.R., 1, p. 4]. The following message was sent from Nairobi by Reuter&apos;s agent on 15th August:  A meeting of the European community has decided to send by the next boat a deputation composed of three of the most prominent settlers to South Africa, Nyasaland and Rhodesia to discuss the Indian question. A convention of various associations is sending a cablegram to the Colonial Secretary urging him, in view of the extreme gravity of the issue, to pay a visit to Kenya Colony and. investigate the matters personally.A further message from the same source was despatched on 20th August :--In the hope that the visit of His Royal Highness might contribute to a settlement of the Indian question in the Kenya Colony, the unofficial members of the Legislature and the members of the Convention Associations have invited the Prince of Wales to visit this Colony when on his way to India.
l:e known all over the frontier, and would involve a deplorable loss of prestige. Another question was the abstention from propaganda, for the omission of which there was no compensation put forward. The proviso regarding the Arms Convention was essential, and the only means of mitigating it was that the Amir himself should become a party to the Convention, and so secure all its advantages. The view of the Secretary of State was that with the material then before them, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would prefer their own alternative treaty without a subsidy.A telegram &quot;from. Sir Henry Dobbs, transmitted [1959 S.] by the Viceroy on 14th August, acknowledged the instructions conveyed in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram [1901 S. of 6th August. Failing the offer of an increased supply of ammunition, he expressed his doubt wdiether any advantage would be obtained in placing before the Afghans the pis-aller treaty in the only form in which we could put it forward. The only alternative remaining was that of an ordinary treaty without subsidy. Sir Henry proceeded to make his suggestions regarding such a treaty. The Viceroy commented : that should it be found necessary to resort to this form of treaty, the lines suggested by Sir Henry appeared suitable, but&quot; his proposals had not been examined in detail.The following telegrams [1976 S.], [no number], [1980 S.], sent by the Viceroy on 16th August, crossed the telegram [4177] despatched by the Secretary of State on.the same date. In the first Sir Henry Dobbs said that he had posted drafts of the exclusive treaty, with supplementary letters, containing our offer to increase, the * ammunition per rifle to 1,000 rounds, and of the alternative treaty, and a memorandum of which he now sent a summary. In this he stated his belief that if the two alternative treaties were placed before the Afghans at the same: time, there was a chance that the offer of additional rounds of ammunition on the one hand, and the no subsidy condition on the other, might induce the Afghans to choose the exclusive treaty.Later information from Sir Henry, included in the same telegram from the Viceroy, stated that an announcement had appeared in the Kabul newspaper which was tantamount to a declaration that a Russian treaty of some kind had been finally ratified. If this were so, the only form of treaty still possible would be an ordinary treaty. &apos;The Viceroy&apos;s second telegram of 16th August supported Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; recommendation of an increased offer of ammunition if there were any chance of making an exclusive treaty acceptable to the Afghans. It was agreed, however, that the announcement in the Kabul press appeared to rule this out of court. Sir Henry had been instructed to address Tarsi regarding the contents of the Russian treaty with reference to this announcement, and to report the result.In telegram [1980 S.] the Viceroy transmitted a message from Sir Henry Dobbs, in which the latter asked to be authorized to act at the earliest moment on clearly defined orders, seeing that the Russian treaty had apparently been ratified, and that there was no longer any cause for delay. In anticipation of the Afghans publishing the non-secret clauses of the treaty, and refusing to communicate, or denying the existence of any secret clauses, although we knew these to exist, Sir Henry proposed to make the disclosure of Russian promises of munitions and aeroplanes a sine qua non. Commenting on. this, the Viceroy said that his Government considered that Sir Henry Dobbs should demand the disclosure of the secret clauses, and if their existence were denied, should tax Tarsi with his admission of the Russian promises of munitions and aeroplanes, but did not think the disclosure should be made a sine qua non. Despite their want of- faith in Afghan assertions, they thought Sir Henry should insist on a written assurance that there was no supplementary agreement in the treaty containing anything directed against us.In a message transmitted [2027] by the Viceroy on 22nd August, Sir Henry Dobbs reported that the stolen mail had been. brought to the mission residence on the 20th. Both the outer and inner cover bags had been opened, but apparently all the letters were intact and there were none missing. Tarsi had written an apologetic letter and Sir Henry had informed him that the incident was closed. In accordance with his instructions Sir Henry had asked Tarsi officially for information regarding&apos; the Russian treaty.On 24th August the Viceroy transmitted [2040 S.&apos;] a further telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs reporting that Tarsi had replied to his letter and had written that 32-1 &quot; B
the Amir had ratified the treaty with Russia. The treaty was based on the principle of neutrality as had been enunciated at Mussoorie and in later discussions. Should a. treaty of friendship be signed between the British and Afghan Governments, Russian consulates would not be established at the points about which the British had expressed doubts. Sir Henry pointed out the importance of- distinguishing between &quot; points &quot; and &quot; frontier tracts.&quot;The Viceroy&apos;8 Report.--&apos;Hhe following telegram was sent on 25th August:  Section 1.   Punjab. There have been no &quot;large or important meetings since the release of the Lahore, Amritsar, Sheikhupura and Jullundur districts from the operation of the Seditious Meetings Act.   The meetings held served to show the present dearth of exciting political topics, and lowered the tension of public feeling.   A police report covering the same period, however, indicates some recrudescence of seditious, activity among Sikhs since the withdrawal of the Act.   The boycott of foreign cloth . has so far proved a failure.   The rural population is unaffected&apos;by this movement, and the women will have nothing to do with it.   The campaign&apos; against liquor is for the moment relaxed in most places.   The economic situation is much improved, and the agricultural population is busy in the fields.Section 2. The Governors visit to, Hissar Rohtak and Karnal passed off successfully. Pie was received with real enthusiasm. An tar Singh Gyam, convicted of sedition in June, signed an apology and promised to abstain from politics. The question of his release is being considered. The Lahore municipality passed a resolution to boycott the Prince of Wales&apos; visit, but in the Punjab press opposition to the visit is now waning.United Provinces. Gandhi, Mahammad Ali Azed Subhani and Stokes toured rapidly through the province in&apos; connexion with the foreign cloth campaign; informal meetings were held at railway stations, and formal meetings in many cities of the province.Section 3. Popular interest and veneration for GandhPs personality is undiminished, &quot;and his religious personality attracts a following rather than his political programme. The foreign cloth matter before the tour showed very little sign of vitality. Present activities point to an outburst of temporary enthusiasm, but the campaign in its preparatory stages has vested interests to contend with, and the dealers are hedging. The small firms hope to bring pressure on the wholesale dealers, and the bigger firms on Manchester. The hope of a fall in prices gives strength to the movement, although obviously the Indian production cannot supply the demand.   Aman Sabhas is being successfully conducted.Section 4. Madras. The Government has issued a statement, explaining that the boycott movement must lead to an immediate rise in prices, and may lead to disorder and looting. The Government do not intend to tolerate disorder, and assure merchants and importers of foreign cloth that they may count on the support of the Government in opposing all unlawful attempts at coercion.&apos; Instructions have been issued to all District Magistrates and the Commissioner of Police in Madras, to take , every legal step to stop illegal picketing, and to protect the merchants, traders, and customers in the pursuit of their lawful avocations. Serious disorders in the Calicut district are separately reported. The Bihar and Orissa Congress Working Committee resolved that for the effective boycott of foreign cloth before 30th September volunteers should be set apart for collecting foreign clothes from every house ; that all workers should concentrate&quot; on the boycott of foreign cloth, and the manufacture of Kliacldi cloth, and that Provincial Congress Committees should spend not less than three-quarters of the contributions to the swarajaya fund to organize the spread of hand spinning.Section 5. Central Provinces. -The celebration to inaugurate the boycott of foreign cloth roused little enthusiasm. The lack of success of the Tilak anniversary celebrations in the Mahratta country was striking, and seems to indicate that the boycott is not much supported at present. There has been some revival of picketing liquor shops, but peaceful, and volunteers called for are not readily forthcoming. Several non-co-operating pleaders have resumed practice. Sixteen out of 29 seats, have been captured by the extremists in the Nagpur municipal elections.Bombay. There is nothing.of special interest to report. There are no important developments in the cloth boycott campaign. Picketing liquor shops is not being generally active, but its early resumption is expected.
Bengal. The situation continues to he clear. District reports are more assuring, and the effect of counter-propaganda is beginning to be seen; the support of the boycott of foreign cloth is lukewarm.Section 6. The Assam-Bengal Railway strike continues, but one strike train service is now resumed. A train was derailed, apparently by strikers, on 16th; 13 were injured.Section 7. Assam. There is considerable excitement from the expected visit of Gandhi, otherwise there is little -of special interest in regard to non-co-operation. Little is heard of the boycott of foreign cloth. Counter-propaganda work is progressing, and arousing interest. The situation on the tea gardens and the railway has quieted down sufficiently to withdraw a great number of the Assam Rifles.Section&apos;8. About 25 per cent, oE a body of coolies, who recently deserted the gardens in the Cachar district, have returned to w&apos;ork, and the rest either found work on other gardens or dispersed among the villagers. There is some local distress on account of the floods. In the North-West Frontier Province the political situation is satisfactory. There has been good rain in all districts. There is an improved: -economic situation.Section 9. Delhi. The boycott has been denounced by the only daily read paper, and more mildly by other Nationalist journals. Id passed off quietly, a limited number of cows being sacrificed. The depressed classes have denounced the non-co-operation movement,General. Except for the serious outbreak in Madras, separately reported, the situation continues easier, as stated in our last telegram. The high price of food, grains in North India gives some cause for anxiety, but the general economic situation has been much improved by a good monsoon. Chief interest centres on the munitions case.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Naval Prize [B.E.R., xlvii, p. 10]. Referring to the telegram sent by the Secretary of State to the Dominions on 30th June, the Governor-General on 18th August telegraphed as follows :-In view of the understanding and the practice adhered to throughout and since the war, that the rights and liabilities arising from seizure in prize attached solely to His Majesty&apos;s Government, my Ministers desire that settlement should be made in accordance with the first-proposal in your telegram, namely, &quot;that the rights and liabilities arising from seizures in which the naval prize fund is not concerned attach to His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;Representatives at League of Nations Assembly.-The Governor-General reported on 25th August that an Order in Council was passed on 19th August appointing the Right Honourable 0. J. Doherty, Minister of Justice, and the Honourable Sir G. H... Perley, K.C.M.G., High Commissioner for Canada in London, to be the Canadian representatives at the second meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations, to-be held in Geneva on 5th September next.AUSTRALIA.German Consular Representation [B.E.B., xxv, p. 10]. On 25th August the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General as follows :  The German Government have represented&apos; that, although aware of the negative-: attitude adopted up to the present by the Commonwealth Government, they neverthe-less considered that it is not consistent with the usages of international relations that the resumption of consular activities should be refused 18 months after the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace.   The German Government further state that the
Swiss Government lias informed them of its urgent wish to be released from the representation of German interests iii Australia. The German Government add that no other protecting Power is prepared to safeguard their interests..The Acting High Commissioner for Australia has received the following cabled advices, dated 2,6th August, from the Prime Ministers Department, Melbourne : WooZ Sales. The outstanding feature of the August wool sales is the strength of the American demand for finer cpialities of best merinoes, wdth Japan competing. The prices are the highest since February. There is a marked appreciation upon the duly rates for medium to good merino tops, due to the Yorkshire demand. A large share of the offerings of merinoes and line crossbreds have been purchased for the Continent. The September allotments throughout the Commonwealth are 100,000-bales. At the Melbourne and Geelong sales 30,000 bales will be offered from 1st to 15th September. It is anticipated that the whole of the old clip stored, prior to the 30th June will be cleared by the end of October. The new clip shows sound, well-grown wool. Sales of it should commence in. November, a result which seemed impossible a few months ago.National Research Council. The Australian National Research Councils first session, which opened at Melbourne on Tuesday last, has secured Australia s position in the International Research Council. Professor Sir Ldgeworth David, first President,, said -it is necessary to establish.the basic chemical industries by a general co-ordination of scientific effort.Civil Aviation. Civil aviation activities are intensifying the demand for pilots. It lias been decided to -surcharge threepence each half-ounce letter carried by the aerial mail service, Geraldton to Derby, Western Australia.Oil in Tasmania. A Tasmanian company is preparing to develop an oil shale holding with an estimated crude oil content of 240 million gallons.Sugar Crop.- The second highest yield ever recorded, this season&apos;s Queensland sugar cane crop is over two million tons, giving 250,000 tons of sugar.A good Season. The season&apos;s agricultural and pastoral prospects are assured. Steady rains have fallen over the wheat areas.Census Figures.- The revised census count shows Australia s population to he 5,436,794, -SOUTH AFRICA.Natal Licensing Ordinance: [B.E.R.,-1, p.&apos;9].-On 22nd August the Officer Administering the Government ofSouth Africa telegraphed the following :  The announcement regarding the Natal Rural Dealers Licensing Ordinance has now been made (viz.: that the assent of the Governor-General of the Union in Council was withheld).Zulu Loyalty.- -Telegraphing from Capetown on 12th August, ReuteFs agent sent the following: ... Colonel Denys Reitz, Minister of Lands, who has been visiting Zululand, received in conversation to-day Solomon, the paramount chief of the Zulus, a young and progressive leader who has clone much to unite the two great factions of the Zulu nation. Solomon expressed to the Minister on behalf of the Zulu nation his desire to visit England to pay his respects to King George. Colonel Reitz promised to submit his retptest to the Government.Unemployment.-From Johannesburg, on 25th August, Renter s agent telegraphed as follows : Owing to the prevailing lack of employment, even ^mechanics and better class workers, including a number of skilled men, are accepting relief work. While this is to a certain extent due to the general depression, the position is largely caused by an influx of men from overseas, owing to the bad state of the engineering trade in Great Britain. A thousand unemployed have registered in the town. Unemployment is also rife in Capetown ami other large centres in the Cape Province.
