GREAT BRITAIN.Unemployment Situation. The following summary of the situation is taken from the special report on unemployment for the week ending 18th August, issued by the Ministry of Labour : In most divisions the coal-mining industry continues depressed, but the improvements recently recorded in the Midlands and north-eastern divisions have been maintained, while prospects in Scotland are a little brighter. In the engineering industry there is no appreciable change to report, except that in the north-western division the textile and electrical machinery branches are busy. The iron and steel industry remains quiet: generally, but, improvements have been observed at some centres in the Midlands. The expected revival in Scotland has not materialized. Apart from activity at isolated centres, there is no change to report in the position of the shipbuilding industry.The Devonshire lace-making industry continues to improve slightly, and silk manufacturers in the north-western division are busy. The fine spinning section of the cotton, industry continues to be fully employed, but the medium and coarse spinning sections are very slack. The cotton and general textile industries in Scotland continue good. In the north-eastern division the woollen and worsted trades maintain the improvement recorded in the last report,The slight improvement registered in the building industry at certain centres in the south-western division has been maintained, but the general depression continues. In the boot and shoe industry the activity previously reported in the south-western division continues. Disquieting reports have been received from the north-western division regarding the prospects in the glass manufacturing industry. Employment in the Welsh tinplate industry continues to be fairly regular, but the copper and spelter industries are still very depressed. The principal jute and flax factories in Scotland are still closed down, and there is very little hope of an early revival in these industries.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.KENYA COLONY.The Indian Problem. Telegraphing from Nairobi on 16th August, Reuter&apos;s agent reported as follows :-The executive of the Indian congress has. cabled: to the Colonial and India Offices expressing its keen disappointment at the steps fore-shadowed by Mr. Winston Churchill and Major E&apos;. F. L. Hood, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, in regard to the solution of the Indian question in Kenya Colony.The executive submits that no solution is possible or acceptable unless absolute 9    equality of status is granted to Indians.This cable should have been confirmed by the full congress which will assemble in September, but owing to its urgency it was despatched immediately.RHODESIA.Future of the Mining Induslry.-Rexiter&apos;s agent telegraphed as follows from Satoona on 14th August: In a speech at a bancpiet here, General Smuts, referring to the mining industry in Rhodesia, said he regretted that the Union Government could not agree with the Chartered Company as to the expropriation of their mineral assets, as he looked upon them as the principal means of development of the country. General Smuts thought that if the Union Government could acquire these minerals they would have one of the most potent weapons possible in their hands to push forward the development of the; country.   He declared that if Rhodesia came into the Union, a determined effort
must be made by-the Union.Government to get control of tbe mineral resources of Rhodesia. He did not think that the Chartered Company had been unfair in the exercise of its undoubted rights, but that was not the question. The question was whether it was not possible for the Government, of this, country to use its mines and minerals as more powerful instruments for the development of the country and whether the Government would not be in a position to give greater encouragement than if the mines were OAvned by a private corporation.General Smuts emphasized that the real need of Rhodesia was a larger white population. The settlement of Avhites in small holdings in all directions must be encouraged. He also declared that unless money was put into the land on a larger scale development would be sIoav. He added : &quot; You require low railway rates, railway development and also the development of mines and minerals, and my faith in Rhodesia is that with that development this country in one generation will be quite unrecognizable by the people sitting here.&quot;In conclusion General. Smuts-said that should Rhodesia enter the Union, the latter would not only carry out everything promised, but would, in so far as the means at its disposal allowed,, do even more.PALESTINE.Monthly Administrative Report, The following items are taken from the report for July last :  Agricultural Service. Except in the Beersheba district, Avhere labour is again scarce, all winter crops are harvested. Tithe estimation and inspection are nearing completion, and threshing is in full swing. The annual collapse of grain prices with the appearance of the new crop on the. market has this year been accentuated by a large carry-over from last season and heavy recent importations from the Hauran. Wheat has fallen from FT. 175 to PT. 127 per 100 kilos. Barley is being sold at Gaza for PT. 80 per 100 kilos. The resulting small margin of profit in relation to local methods of cultivation and current yields explains a widespread interest in new staples (vegetables and tobacco) and a considerably increased cultivation of such oil crops as sesame. Climatic conditions have favoured the summer crops ; sesame and peas, except for the local occurrence of aphis and Aveevil, are satisfactory; the melon crop was very good, large quantities being exported by sea to Beirut and. Port Said and by rail to Damascus, but the local market was still over supplied, and prices have fallen heavily. The vintage and almond harvest have commenced, and vegetables and fruit are plentiful and cheap, Large consignments of table grapes are being shipped to Egypt.   Picking and curing of tobacco is in progress.Veterinary Service. -The condition of livestock is good, and prices are distinctly easier. The importation of slaughter cattle from Madagascar, Rumania and the Sudan is being organized on a permanent basis in recognition of the fact that local supply must necessarily be inadequate for years to come. Merchants are even offering to build-and place under the control of the veterinary service their own quarantine accommodation at Haifa and Jaffa. During the past month 12,4:40 head of stock Avere imported, and grazing flocks, including transport animals, numbering 4,020 head, returned to Syria and Transjordania.Forest Service. Timber and shade trees are being extensively propagated at all forest, nurseries, In the hope that loan funds may be forthcoming next Avintor for afforestation on commercial lines. Despite the failure of the late rains, most experi-mental plantations are looking, well, and furnish valuable data for application to large scale operations in the future. Considerable experience has already been gained, in respect to afforestation of coastal sand-dunes.Antiquities. The excavations at Beisan continue to produce important finds. During the last month, 130 tombs have been cleared&quot;and recorded; some of these go back, in date, to about 2,000-B.C., and the information they have provided will be of permanent value to archaeology. Excavation has been resumed upon the central mound, where an effort is being made to excavate completely the Arab stratum inside the main walls before proceeding to remove the Byzantine church on the summit.Commerce and Industry. Trade conditions were unusually subdued in the tense-period preceding, the ratification of the mandate, and, except for building, little business Avas done.
Transit trade at Haifa still decreases, and through the redaction by the French authorities of the railway tariff for cereals on the Syrian railway, may he entirely diverted from Haifa to Beirut, although the erection of the new Levant bonded warehouses is likely to produce a larger movement at the former port.The Anglo-Egyptian Bank opened a branch at Amman, Transjordania, on 13th June.Immigration and Travel. 2,823 travellers entered Palestine in June, and 2,155 left, including 58 discharged Egyptian labourers, 181 emigrants (jews 68, christians 53, moslems 60), and 131 lately arrived immigrants (jews 113, christians-18)-     -Four hundred and ninety-eight immigrants, of whom 474 were jews, entered. Palestine during the same period. Of the Jewish immigrants, 263 were from Poland and 61. from Rumania.Twenty immigrants who failed to comply with the Palestine immigration regula-tions were refused admission.Labour. The employment situation has shown some improvement, due for the most part to budding activity in the principal towns and reduced immigration of unskilled men daring the past few months; unemployed are estimated now to number only about 800 men.In view of the labour situation, permits for the immigration of unskilled labour-have been lately refused. Nevertheless, to meet the need of skilled workmen which still exists, applications by individual employers for the admittance into Palestine of men, designated by name, have been granted, to an average menthly extent of about 70. In addition, authority has been given for the immigration during the quarter July-September of 425 selected members of skilled trades, plasterers, cement workers,, house-painters, carpenters, joiners, plumbers, blacksmiths, &amp;c, whose arrival should, relieve the immediate pressure in those trades and reduce the excessive wages now demanded.Extradition. Several conferences were held with the chief British representative and the chief adviser of the Trans Jordan Government concerning extradition between Transjordan and Palestine and Transjordan and Syria ; and also concerning the joint working of the mineral deposits in the Bead Sea.Police and Prisons. The incidence of heinous crime still decreases, most markedly in respect to highway robbery. Active operations against brigands have been carried out in southern Palestine by detachments of British and Palestine gendarmerie, and daily searches made in their known and likely resorts; since 18th June, only two cases of brigandage have occurred in southern Palestine.IRAQ.The following extracts are taken from-the 15th Iraq Intelligence Report, dated 1st August 1922 :--Anglo-Iraq Treaty. The treaty is not yet signed. While in Baghdad there is a general feeling of weariness and desire to see the conclusion of the matter, in Hillah division feeling has. run high, owing chiefly to the encitement to anti-mandate pro-&apos; nouncements on the part of Arab administrative officials. It is, however, satisfactory to observe that when the assistant mutasarrif, who is a moderate and fair-minded man, was charged with the task of effecting settlements&apos; in the controversies which had arisen between pro-mandate and anti-mandate shaikhs, he had no difficulty in enforcing the orders of Government, thus disproving the assertions of his less impartial colleagues that Government interference would lead to open rebellion.Internal Order,-Though public order in the Muntafiq Liwah still leaves much to Be desired, the position is improving owing to the administrative capacity shown by the mutasarrif, Yasin Pasha, of whom the D.A. gives a most favourable and encouraging, account. The nucleus of a strong moderate party exists in Baghdad, where the presence of Ali Sulaiman and other convinced pro-British shaikhs of the Euphrates is of great assistance in stabilizing the situation. The tone of the local vernacular press has greatly improved.Position at Rowanduz. Aerial action at Rowanduz, if not productive of much damage in the town, has produced a marked effect among the surrounding tribes, especially the Pizhder, who are now intercepting Turkish missives and sending them
to Arbil. Rowanduz has been transferred from the Van command to the Jazirah army, of which it is now credibly reported that &apos;Ali Ihsan has been given command, an extremely significant appointment. The Kemalists are making strenuous efforts to improve the connexion between Rowanduz and Shemsdinan and Rowanduz and Jazirah. But they have not made any headway with the Baliq group and the Khushnao appear to be descending on the anti-Turkish side of the fence. They have, however, succeeded in reconciling the Shernakh and Batwau, a necessary preliminary to any attack on Zakho.Ibn Saud&apos;s Attitude. Cordial letters have been exchanged between King Faisal and Ibn Saud. The latter is reported to have taken over Sakakah and Jof without resistance.INDIA.27m Fortnightly Report. The following official message on events during the fortnight ended 24th August has been received from India : Madras. On the occasion of the visit of the civil disobedience committee to Guntur, a considerable number of persons had to be arrested for disobedience of orders which the magistrate had passed under section 144 Criminal Procedure Code, under which section certain magistrates may require any person to abstain from acts which are likely to cause annoyance or danger or disturbance of the public peace, &amp;c The general opinion, however, even amongst&apos; extremists, seems to be that the time is not ripe for mass civil disobedience, and the most that is recommended is individual disobedience to orders under section .144, &amp;c. Most districts report that affairs are quiet enough at present, and in only two districts has action against new speakers been required. &apos;Bombay.-In Bombay city the consensus of opinions of witnesses examined by the congress civil disobedience- committee was that the non-co-operation movement, was on the wane, and was obsolete, and the workers demoralized. At Poona the section headed by Kelkar pressed for individual independence for endeavouring to enter the legislative councils and the right of self-defence, i.e., in the courts, whilst both this and the section which opposed an3r modification of programme urged that Maharashtra, the Maratha districts of the Deccan, was not ready for mass civil disobedience, but favoured individual civil disobedience, as in the case of the Tata hydro-electric scheme in Mulshi Petha. [A dam is being constructed here at the mouth of a valley in connexion with a large electrical power scheme for Bombay. The obstruction engineered by the non-co-operation party necessitated the issue of orders under the Criminal Procedure Code.] At a meeting of the working committee of the&apos; central caliphate committee it was stated that there was no appreciable balance in the caliphate fund, and it was decided to utilize one lakh of the 16 lakhs in the Smyrna&apos; and Angora funds for the caliphate fund. W. C. Kalkar,. the president of the provincial congress committee, has resigned. Political agitation generally continues at a low ebb.Bengal. There has been no appreciable change in the political situation, though reports of inflammatory speeches have been received. Progress in the constructive programme has been insignificant. Labour on the railways seems to be settling down, and strikes at jute mills are apparently at an end. A general improvement in the situation is revealed in the attitude of the public in various places which were visited by the Governor. In the eastern districts of the presidency attempts to organize hartels failed miserably. In Bakargunj district, which last year was a hotbed of the non-co-operation movement, non-co-operators succeeded in securing the return of only five out of 52 candidates for the local municipal council.In Chittagong the attitude of all classes, in the areas in which it was found necessary to impose additional police, is now friendly and respectful. An attempt to resume picketing shops selling foreign cotton goods in Calcutta has not been pushed with any vigour. According to the newspapers the civil disobedience committee was received by very large crowds on their arrival in Calcutta. No excitement, however, has followed on their visit nor on the release of Mr. C. R. Das from jail, though a meeting was held to welcome him on his return.43-5 B
GThe general impression left in Calcutta is that the committee will not recommend resort to civil disobedience; A very interesting document has come into the hands of. the Government in the shape of a report by the Barisal district congress committee to, the provincial committee, Barisal was last year one of the hotbeds of non-co-operation. The report admits that membership of the district congress committee has been reduced, owing to the apathy of the general public and lack of some new sensation. The same influences have contributed to a reduction in the number of volunteers, who have been further disheartened by the failure to obtain swaraj within a year as promised by Gandhi and by lack of proper provision for the education and support.of students who left their colleges. The report states that only Rs. 3,000 have been obtained during the current year for the Tilak swaraj fund, that national schools are in*a miserable condition, that arbitration courts have not tried many cases, and that Government have the support of the Namasudras. [This caste (the members of which are mainly agricultural) form an important part of the hindu population of eastern Bengal. They are of an aboriginal type, despised in the estimation of brahmans, though not &quot; untouchable,&quot;] Finally, it is definitely stated that the country is not ready for civil disobedience, and that.there is no hope of creating excitement in the district, if civil disobedience is started elsewhere. The state of affairs dealt with in the document may be taken as fairly representative of the non-co-operation move-roent in the Bengal mofussil. . C. R. Das has expressed his intention of studying the situation before giving any advice as to the course of action to be adopted by non-co-operators.United Provinces. No change is reported in the political situation. The Bakri Id, an important mohammedan festival one month before the Mohurram, passed off quietly. Everywhere in Meerut division the number of cows sacrificed is reported to be considerably larger than a yea]&apos; ago. Bareilly city also reports an increase. Etawah is now reported to he quieter. Sporadic efforts to keep agitation alive continue without much apparent effect and without any very definite, objective. According to a press telegram, at the public meetings, held to protest against the premier&apos;s speech of 2nd August, at Allahabad and Luc-know, non-co-operators, who outnumbered the moderate element, succeeded in getting the upper hand and passed their own resolution, thanking the Premier for revealing the true British mind and the hollowness of the reforms..Bihar and Orissa. The political situation remains quiet. The observance of Gandhi day, the, 18th of the calendar month, fell very flat. Attempts to revive the non-co-operation agitation continue, but so far they have not met- with much success. More meetings have, been held and the tone of speeches has been rather more violent, but attendance, at. meetings, has been poor, and the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the audience conspicuous. Attempts to collect money for the next annual congress, meeting, which, is to be held at Gaya in this province, have met, with very little, success. The. governor was: accorded a uniformly cordial reception in all districts in Tirhut, It is reported that there is some genuine feeling - about the expression &quot; shouting the. azan,&quot; the summons to prayer used by the inspector-general of prisons, iu giving evidence in the case against Mazharul Haq, due to the word used to translate &quot;shouting&quot; in the vernacular reports of the case,, and it is probable that the question of calling &quot;azan&quot; iu jail will be vigorously agitated.. The tone of the proceedings, in the. Legislative: Council has been noticeably more: friendly to Government than in earlier sessions,, and there .is far less violent speaking than had been customary. No. breaches of the peace: occurred at the Bakri . Id, hut. the tension was a&apos;ery considerable in places; an increased number of cattle were, sacrificed,, and it is probable that special precautions will be necessary in some districts, next year. Labourers at Jamshedpur, the. great coalmining and industrial eeatre founded; by- the Tata, companies, are undoubtedly jumpy, but on. the whole local officers&apos; do; not think that the. Labour Association will be successful in working up a strike.Pcnjar. Very little enthusiasm was visible at. the celebrations of the anniversary of TilalPs death. The, non-co-operation movement continues to lose ground owing to lack of a definite policy. The municipalities of Rohtak and Jhajjar, which contain a strong non-co-operation element, presented unanimous addresses to the Governor, who received a cordial welcome everywhere. Objectionable and violent speeches continue to be delivered by paid political workers of botlisexes, but released political
prisoners show a marked disinclination to risk a return to jail. Liquor shops at Jhelum and Rawal Pindi are still being picketed in a half-hearted manner.The main feature of the sikh situation has been the uncertainty shown by the Shiromani gurdwara parbandhak committee with regard to the line of action to be adopted. It appears that they lack courage to proceed with the seizures of the shrines, and the deputy commissioner of Amritsar regards the actual seizure as improbable. Meanwhile there is much dissension amongst sikh extremist leaders, and the sikh population appears to be daily more disinclined for agitation. Master Mota Singh and Bahi Gurdit Singh have been sentenced each to five years&apos; transportation under section 124a for seditious writing and speeches: the former had been absconding for some time in connexion with the Akali conspiracy case, and the latter was one of the leaders of the sikhs who came from Vancouver in the S.S. Komogata Maru in 1914.Central Provinces. There are some signs of a recrudescence of political agitation, particularly in Chattisgarh. The provincial congress committee (hindu districts) have recently resolved to inform the All-India congress committee that collective civil disobedience is the only weapon to restore the caliphate and to remedy the Punjab wrongs. Sunderlal, the president, was presented with an address by two municipalities in the Chattisgarh district, and his visits were signalized by flying the national flag on municipal buildings. In spite, however, of his efforts, non-co-operation activities are languid, enlistment of volunteers arouses no enthusiasm, and national schools are closing down. Action has been taken under section 108, Criminal Procedure Code, requiring security for good behaviour against some of the firebrands who have served their sentences in jail. Statistics show that the number of congress members enrolled is not large.   The Bakri Id passed off qttietly.Assam. The only noteworthy events are the visit of the civil disobedience committee to Gauhati and Tezpur, and of the caliphate enquiry committee to Sylhet. Evidence given before the former is said to be in favour of individual civil disobedience rather than mass civil disobedience. The general trend of evidence recorded by the caliphate committee is much to the same effect, though it was also urged that non-co-operators should capture seats in the councils so as to obstruct the Government. So far these visits appear to have had little effect and to have aroused little excitement. In Sylhet the additional police have now been withdrawn, and the atmosphere is reported to be peaceful and quiet.Burma. According to a press telegram a split has occurred in the general council of Burmese associations over the question of boycotting the reformed council. The struggle between two groups for the control of the association is in progress. Monks are coming more and more into the limelight, and the anti-dyarchy campaign has fallen almost entirely into their hands. On the other hand the moderate press has suddenly discovered that the participation by monks in politics is destructive of the purity of the buddhist religion. 0ktama&apos;s visit to Mandalay has not caused any great political excitement, such as the numbers avIio attended his lectures might suggest. If this campaign proves successful moderates will emerge for the purpose of standing for election, keeping as a loop-hole, in case there is a landslide of popular opinion against them, the policy of not taking their seats in the Council.The prosecution under section 124a of two monks from Mandalay has been sanctioned. The reception of Sir Plarcourt ButleFs appointment to Burma has been on the whole favourable. &apos;Nortii-West Frontier PROViNCE.-The political situation remains quiet.General. Interest at present centres round the recent speech of the Prime Minister, which is described by the Indian press and politicians as tantamount to a repudiation of the declaration of August 19171 and of the declarations embodied in the Government of India Act, and in the proclamation and message to, the Legis-lature of the King-Emperor, and as indicating the intention of Great Britain to fasten permanently on India the yoke of an alien bureaucracy. These charges were answered by His Excellency on the 19th August in reply to a deputation which waited on him. The effect of this speech remains to be seen, but comments at present are not uniform.
THE DOMINIONS.SOUTH AFRICA.The following items of information were telegraphed by ReuteFs agents :  Rhodesia. The Nationalist leaders, General Hertzog, Mr. Tielman Roos and Mr. Fichardt, to-day addressed a crowded meeting at the town hall of Johannesberg,. where they had an enthusiastic reception. General Hertzog declared that the Nationalists did not oppose the inclusion of Rhodesia in the Union, but it must be as the outcome of the popular will and be legally carried out. He strongly protested against the Government treating Parliament as a mere registering machine.. [Johannesburg, 19th August.]Mining Industries. After live days&apos; deliberation, the conference between the. Mining Industry Board and representatives of the employers and employees of the gold and coalmining industries has reached an agreement for the creation of a conciliation board.&apos;4&apos;   [Johannesburg, 19th August.]Telegraphing again on 22nd August the same agent further reported ; The agreement for the creation of a conciliation board, was formally signed&apos; to-day by representatives of both sides, subject to the ratification of the trade unions. The latter are in no way enthusiastic, but it is believed that they are mostly willing to give the machinery a fair and sympathetic trial. The conciliation board consists of 12 members, six on each side. A noteworthy feature is that in the event of disagreement an independent referee will preside at a further meeting of the board at which the matter wall be discussed again, and the referee&apos;s report, which is not binding on either side, will be published together with the boarcPs report or reports.. No strike or lock-out can ensue until a fortnight after the board had made its report.. * The Mining Industry Board, which includes Mr. William Brace, Labour Adviser to the British Department of Mines, was appointed last March after the Band rebellion to consider the best methods of working the mines and the question of the ratio of European to native labour, and it has been con-ferring with the representatives of the gold and coalmining industries with the object of discovering the best means of promoting conciliation in the mining industry,
