GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs have been taken from the reports of the Ministry of Labour for the weeks ending 24th and 31st May :-General Survey of the Labour Situation during the weeks ending 24th and 31st May&apos;     &apos;I. (24th May). The period of strain following upon the introduction of the first half of the wages reductions agreed upon in the shipbuilding trades has now been got over. The electricians have resumed work, and the attitude of engineers is no longer aggressive. The resumption of negotiations with regard to the shipyard joiners&apos; dispute, though it is at the moment without success, is important. The strike of ships&apos; stewards and allied workers has not been complete, even within the union, and the Ministry have been approached on the matter by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. In the cotton textile industry the most noticeable fact wdth regard to the progress of the negotiations on the question of wages reductions is the tendency towards joint working of the various amalgamations concerned. The trade unions connected with the engineering trades put before Sir David Shackleton on the 20th May their suggestion that a court of inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act should be set up for their industry.The annual meeting of the co-operative congress concluded at Scarborough on the 18th. May. A general feature of the proceedings was the way in which the delegates seized upon any point haviug a political flavour, sometimes almost to the total exclusion of the purely co-operative point of view which used so severely to be kept to the front. The conferences of the Electrical Trades Union and of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives have been concluded, while that of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association opened at Bournemouth on the 23rd May.II. (31st May). The Prime Minister&apos;s invitation of the 25th May to the two parties to the coal mining dispute to meet him in joint conference proved acceptable, and the conference accordingly took place on the 27th. On the following day, detailed proposals towards atsettlement were communicated separately to the two sides.An equally important development of the week has been the official suspension of the sympathetic movement in support of the miners amongst railwaymen and transport workers. Both these bodies have troubles of their own ahead. The failure to secure agreed terms of reference between the negotiating committee of railway managers and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, with regard to the submission of the chums of railway shopmen to the industrial court, has a direct effect upon the submission to the court of the claim of the National Union of. Railwaymen on behalf of their shopmen members, while a proposal for a national reduction in the minimum wage of dockers, as fixed last year by Lord Shaw&apos;s court of inquiry, is foreshadowed. It is significant, however, that the first step toward a frank suspension of the sympathetic movement was taken in their annual conference by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation are also concerned with the strike of ships&apos; cooks and stewards, in connexion with which the Ministry are approaching the employers on behalf of the federation, and with the general position of road transport workers.Sir David Shackleton met the employers in the engineering trades on the 24th May, and representatives of the trade unions, for a second time, on the 31st, and a joint meeting was arranged between the two sides for the 3rd June. The resumption of work on the 23rd May, by various groups of members of the Electrical Trades Union who were on strike, on the instructions of the delegate conference of the union, appears to have been complete, with the exception of some 120 members who are still on strike at Aberdeen.1 Sympathetic Action by Trade Unions in Support of the Miners.&apos; At a joint meeting of the executive committees of the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, held on the 31st May, it was decided that the embargo on foreign and other coal should be totally removed.   A similar decision had
already been arrived at by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen at their animal conference on the 26th May, and, from assurances reported to have been received by this society from the Minister of Transport and the railway managers&apos; committee, it would appear that all railwaymen who have been suspended as a result of their refusal to handle coal will be reinstated at once. Apart from this decision, there has been very little development in the situation; the dockers on strike at Aberdeen and Leith have returned to work, and negotiations have been opened between the dockers&apos; union officials and the Glasgow shipowners with a view to settling the strike in Glasgow.Financial assistance is still being given to the miners by various trade unions and, the co-operative societies, and at the annual conference of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades it was decided to assist the miners in obtaining extension of credits, particularly in respect of food.Statistics of the Unemployment Position. On the 20th May, in the United Kingdom, 2,037,217 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,494,170 were lodged by males and 543,047 by females. At the same date 1,181,078 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 600,583 were lodged by males and 580,495 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 86,143 totally unemployed, and 48,808 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 27th May was 2,1.26,800. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.The Buxton Committee [B.E.R., xli, p. 3]. On 21st May the High Commissioner of South Africa informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that tb.3 Resident Commissioner in Southern Rhodesia had reported that on 20th May Mr. Fletcher had given notice in the Legislative Council to move, on 25th May, as follows : Tliat it be an instruction from this Council to the deputation of the elected members proceeding to London to confer with the Colonial Office on. the proposed constitution granting responsible government to Southern Rhodesia (1) that the Colonial Secretary be requested to arrange for the referendum on responsible govern-ment proposed under the Buxton report to include the alternative of linking up with the Union of South Africa ; (2) that in order to give effect to this the Imperial Government be requested to approach the Government of the Union of South Africa, with a view of ascertaining all details and the most favourable terms on which Southern Rhodesia would be admitted as part of the Union in the event of the people so deciding when the referendum is taken, thus placing a clear issue before the country of responsible government or union with the South and enabling the people of Southern Rhodesia to record their votes with a full knowledge oil the actual position in each case.Telegraphing again on the 28th May, the High Commissioner said that he had not received a further report from the Resident Commissioner, but that, according to press reports, Mr. Fletcher&apos;s motion, after being seconded for the purpose of discussion, had been severely criticised and eventually withdrawn. Two days later he confirmed the report that the motion had been withdrawn.EGYPT.His Majesty&apos;s Government and Egypt. On 25th May Lord Allenby reported [No. 362] that he had published a communique alluding to the recent disturbances, and saying that, he did not intervene in Egyptian party politics, but that the ultimate responsibility for law and order devolved upon him. 29-2 A 2
WDM.The Frontier Sit/nation [B.E.R., xliv, p. 4].-According to information received, the Viceroy telegraphed [857] on 26th May that sniping in Waziristan still continued. A. successful operation near Wana had been carried, out on. the night of the 21st-22nd, in which, the enemy&apos;s losses amounted to 30 killed and 20 prisoners, while our own casualties were negligible.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xliv, p. 4].-Following a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs, received on 24th May, asking for elucidation on certain points, the Viceroy transmitted [749 S.] on 26th May a telegram from our representative, reporting that he, and others of the Mission, had been present at a conference with Tarsi arid other Afghans on 23rd May. On Sir Henry&apos;s insistence that the British Government could not yield on. the .question, of ,.the consulates, Tarsi had replied that he was certain that the Russians would not yield either, especially as the consuls-designate for Kandahar, Ghazni and &quot;Jalalabad were accompanying Rosen-burg, and that if we maintained our. insistence, the question resolved itself into a choice between the two, and that the refusal of the Russian treaty would inevitably mean war. Tarsi had then announced, and subsequently repeated, that Afghan-istan would have liked treaties with both Powers, but if forced to a choice would prefer -a treaty with&quot;Great Britain, dependent, however, on, a definite assurance as to what measure of assistance she was prepared to give in the case of a breach between Afghanistan and Russia. On the strength of this assertion that it had come to a choice between-a&apos;treaty with Great Britain and a treaty with Russia, Sir Henry Dobbs announced that he had authority to offer Afghanistan an annual subsidy of Rs. 40 lakhs, conditional on a satisfactory treaty with Great Britain, the refusal of a treaty with Russia, and an arrangement whereby the establishment of anti-British propaganda by Indian revolutionaries or others on Afghan soil would be prohibited. A further concession would be the supply,of arms, &amp;c, as already detailed, in the event of an unprovoked attack by Russia. The amount of the subsidy proposed had appeared to please the Afghans, but they demurred to the insufficiency of the proposed contribution of arms. Colonel Muspratt had suggested certain numbers of rifles and guns which he thought would satisfy the Afghans, and Sir Henry asked for authority to raise the offer of arms to. that extent, and whether he could give an assurance to the effect that, in addition to gifts of arms and ammunition as agreed, the British Government would undertake, in the event of an unprovoked attack by Russia, to assist Afghanistan, as far as lay in her power, with money and ammunition throughout the operations necessitated by such attack.Commenting on the foregoing in a telegram.[759 S.] dated 27th May, the Viceroy said that, in whatever form we conveyed our assurance against Russian aggression to Afghanistan, unless we could embody in the public treaty the main fact that we should support Afghanistan against unprovoked aggression, it woidd remain a source of danger. He argued that on the one hand we might put ourselves in the wrong with the League of Nations, and on the other that we might be placing unmerited reliance on the good faith of Afghanistan, which might result in our being involved in a war with Russia. He proposed an addition to. clause 1 of the draft treaty,-which would reproduce the purport of our past treaties with Afghanistan, and by using the phrase &quot; a third Power,&quot; would avoid definite reference to Russia. . The Viceroy suggested.He. had. pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government, had investigated the Egyptian grievances, and: were seeking to remedy them. They had invited (? the Sultan) to appoint a delegation, and the freedom of and the subjects of, discussion by the delegation which had been nominated were not restricted. A declaration as to the.objects of the negotiations had been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but beyond the assurance given therein, no. concession could be made in advance., He had also stated that, His Majesty&apos;s Government offered their friendship. and awaited the response of Egypt. It was not for him to advise as to the response, but having the interests of Egypt at heart, he expressed the hope that patriotism and a sense of the realities, would dead the Egyptians, appreciating our policy of friendship, to follow the path of peace and conciliation in their dealings with each other..
that Sir Henry Dobbs might aim at obtaining a secret clause embodying the proposal put forward by him in the preceding telegram regarding the assurance which might be given to Afghanistan. ..In acknowledging the foregoing telegram the Secretary of State telegraphed on 30th May his approval of the proposals subject to the suggestion that an exchange of notes would be preferable to secret clauses.. Further, lie suggested that a specific assurance should be obtained from the Afghans that .they would not embark on an aggressive policy against Russia.The Viceroy transmitted. [780 S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs on 31st May, in which he announced that Rosen burg had arrived at Kabul, and that Tarsi was exhibiting signs of impatience and suspicion regarding the delay in signing the treaty. The latter also stated that he had difficulty in finding excuses for further delaying the signature of the treaty with Russia. Sir Henry pointed out that this, with the extreme attitude of the Kemalists, and their closer relations with the Bolsheviks, was adding difficulties to his work.The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following telegram was sent on 1st June : Section 1. Madras. The week has been uneventful, though the reports show that the non-co-operation propaganda continues. The movement has made least progress in the southern districts. The caliphate movement has assumed a definitely religious aspect in Malabar, somewhat to the detriment of the Gandhi propaganda. Ramazan is pursuing its normal course, and the district magistracy faces with equanimity a visit from Gandhi. In a few districts the anti-drink campaign has assumed a decidedly (? violent) aspect. The movement for the non-payment of taxes has not made much progress so far. Sixty-one convicts have escaped from the (? Madras Government ? Trichinopoly) central jail. The Madras Government reports that, after consulting with the&quot; advocate-general, they proposed to prosecute Mohamed Ali for a speech made in April. No ,reply has been sent to this, and the matter is being discussed with Lord Willingdon, who is in Simla.Bombay. Gand.hi&apos;s recent tour in Sind is regarded by the masses rather as a tamasha than as a political event, and has been entirely unsuccessful in reconciling the acrimonies between various non-co-operationist leaders. Endeavours are again being made through the maulvis and mullahs to start an extensive agitation amongst the mohamedans in the rural areas of Sind.Section 2. A non-official committee is enquiring into the Malegaon disturbances. The picketing of liquor shops continues generally.Bengal. There has been no marked development in the non-co-operation move-ment, but the agitation continues in some of the mufussil districts, the suspension of practice by pleaders being a subject of discussion ; the general opinion of members of the bar is that such action is economically unsound and unnecessary, and consequently the majority of lawyers continue to practise.United Provinces. A feature of the Allahabad district conference, hitherto not reported, was an attempt to strengthen the hold on. the Kishan Sabhas, especially in the Oudh district, which bad been proclaimed under-the Seditious Meetings Act; attempts were made to organize a monster meeting of cultivators at Allahabad, but the numbers actually present were not more than 2,000 or 3,000. The extremists are organizing and collecting funds, but little progress has been made in the latter direction.Section 3. The loyal leagues are now sufficiently developed to prove their value, and the moral effect is good. The extremist leaders are genuinely perturbed in some oases by the clanger of violence and rumours of a threatened Afghan invasion.Section 4. As a counterpart to the extremists&apos; shia conference already reported an opposition shia meeting was organized at Lucknow ; it was attended by the leading shias, and passed a resolution accepting the Government communique about Najaf.Section 5. The governor has recently paid a short visit to Lucknow, and finds the situation steadily deteriorating.Section 6. A riot, an outcome of the Kisan Sabha movement, occurred at Mauagon, in the Allahabad district, between the mohamedan zemindars and the hindu cultivators.   The mohamedans, using guns, killed 2 and wounded LI hindus.Bihar and Orissa. There is no material change in the political situation. The .most important feature is the growing tendency to a large, noisy and disorderly.
ubody to crowd tbe courts when the non-co-operators are about to undergo sentence or be placed on trial, but no disorder has occurred except at Giridih. There has been renewed friction between the hindus and mohamedans over cow slaughter at Gaya.North-West Frontier Province. -The political situation is generally satisfactory. The General Press Committee continues its session and has nearly concluded the examination of witnesses.Section 7. On the whole, the situation is no worse and the general atmosphere is slightly better. There is less violent talk and there are more signs of. a real difference between the extremist leaders.Section 8. Mohamed Ali and Shaukat Ali have now publicly apologized for the violence of their speeches in the United Provinces, and have furnished the under-taking mentioned in last week&apos;s telegram. We have therefore decided to refrain from prosecuting them in the United Provinces of in Madras for speeches already delivered, on condition that the undertaking is observed.THE DOMINIONS.Arrival of the Premiers for the Conference. Mr. Hughes and Mr. Massey have-arrived in this country for the conference of Prime Ministers which wdl be opened on 16th June; General Smuts should arrive on Saturday, and Mr. Meighen was to leave Canada on 7th June.   It is not certain that Mr. Scpiires will be able to attend.SOUTH AFRICA.Proposed Reduction of Miners&apos;&apos; Wages. ReuteFs agent reported from Johannesburg on 28th May that an importaut conference had been held between the Chamber of Mines and the South African Industrial Federation on the question of a reduction of wages of persons employed in or about mines, in consequence of the decrease in the.price of gold. The Chamber suggested a cut of 3s. a shift, amounting to 18s. a week, as from 1st July next. The men had asked for time to-consider the matter.
