GREAT BRITAIN.The first of the following paragraphs is taken from the report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 10th May, and the other two from the report for the week ending 17th May :  National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. It is reported that a further step in the opposition of the building trades operatives to the Governments proposal to introduce 50,000 ex-service men into the industry has been taien by the issue of a special circular to all branches of the federation throughout the country. This document calls the attention of members to the details of the Governments scheme, and goes on to formulate the duty of members when the scheme is put into operation, in the following terms:  &quot; 1. If dilutees are introduced in your workshop or job, under no circumstancesmust you assist in training. &quot; 2. Dilutees must not be allowed to enter the instructional factories set up forthe training of ex-service men. &quot; 3. If dilutees are started in your workshop, or on your job, the full facts must be tabulated at once and reported to your society and the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. &quot; In regard to No. 1, if you are victimized by employers for refusing to train,your unions and the national federation will support you. &quot; In regard to No. 2, if dilutees are introduced, the teachers for training disabledmen will be at once withdrawn or expelled from their unions. &quot; Any violation of these instructions by any member or members must be at once reported to their unions, and members must be dealt with under their general rules.&quot;The circular is signed by Mr. George Hicks, president, and Mr. E. Coppock, secretary of the federation.General Survey of the v;eeh ending ilth May. The situation in the coal-mining industry remains unchanged, although the position is generally regarded as being rather more hopeful than a week ago. The threatened unofficial strike of railwaymen and transport workers on the 15th May did not materialize; the decision of the executives of the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, on the 13th, to tighten the embargo on foreign coal and on all coal &quot; handled by blacklegs,&quot; no doubt had considerable influence on the men concerned. The position as regards sympathetic action may be said, therefore, to be somewhat easier than a week ago. Sympathetic action, however, once embarked on in whatever form, is apt at any time to have peculiar ramifications, and to lead to unlooked for consequences. This is illustrated by the dispute at the Greenwich power station, and by the ballot vote which is now being taken on the question of a sympathetic strike by the tramwaymen in the employment of the London County Council. Regarding this, however, it may be noted that the transport workers are reported to be divided, and Mr. F. Hodges is understood to have expressed the opinion that action by the railwaymen and transport workers would not now be of much assistance to the miners, and might even injure their cause by making victimization the issue of the clay, and thus driving the mineFs dispute into the background.The negotiations with respect to the proposed reductions in wages in the woollen textile, cotton textile, and engineering industries have continued during the week, but no agreements have been arrived at. Meanwhile, the strikes by the electricians and ship stewards against such reductions continue. The xmemployment situation grows steadily worse, and many firms have closed down for an extended period during the holidays.The usual Whitsuntide trade union and other conferences have been held during the week. The rejection at the annual co-operative congress at Scarborough by l,68tj votes to 1,682 of the proposed constitution for an alliance between the Co-operative party and the Labour party is of some interest. The result of this decision would appear to be that, although a formal alliance between the two &quot;bodies has been rejected, the Co-operative party will continue to work on their original constitution,
and actually in alliance with the Labour party.   Attention is also drawn to the ratification by an annual conference of the Union of Post Office Workers, at Edinburgh, of the action of the executive in regard to a strike policy.The Unemployment Position-On the 6th May, in the United Kingdom, 1,877,111 unemployment (books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-, of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,361,181 were lodged by males and 515,930 by females. At the same date 1,106,313 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 548,426 were lodged by males and 557,887 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 77,666 totally unemployed and 28,995 working short time.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.KENYA COLONY.The Indian Question. Reuter&apos;s agent reported from Nairobi on 17th May that at a mass meeting of Indians, which had been very largely attended, a resolution proposed by Mr. Jeevanjee, to pay no income tax, on the ground that there should be no taxation without representation, was unanimously adopted.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.The Buxton Committee [B.E.R.; xliii, p. 3].-On 18th May the following telegram was sent by the High Commissioner for South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : The Resident Commissioner of Southern Rhodesia has telegraphed the text of the resolution to be moved by Sir Charles Coghlan in the Legislative Council on 19th May. The following is a summary :-(l) The elected members have considered the Buxton report and, subject to (3), approve it unanimously; (2) they record their deep appreciation of the sympathetic treatment of the request for responsible Government; (3) they feel that there are some details which could be more advantageously discussed through a deputation to yoxi than by correspondence. As an example they point out that the liabilities referred to in clause 89 include items, totalling 363,000L, which under the Cave award are chargeable against land on the same basis as accumulated., deficits, and that it does not appear that these items should form part of the public debt to be assumed by the new Government; (4) they agree that it would&apos;be advantageous to all parties that the present anomalous state of affairs should be brought to an end as soon as possible. They also agree as to the importance of local knowledge in preparing a constitution and as to the &apos;-- ? of a deputation. They desire to send a deputation without waiting for the constitution to be drafted, and hope that you will extend an invitation, for the reception of their representatives at the earliest possible date ; (5) they believe that by acting on the report the Imperial Government will take important steps towards securing the future of the territory as a prosperous and contented part of the British Empire.Telegraphing again on 20th May the High Commissioner said that the Resident Commissioner of Southern Rhodesia had reported that the day before in the Legislative Council Sir Charles Coghlan had moved and Mrs. Jollie seconded the resolution &quot; that this Council approves of the subjoined memorandum expressing the views of the elected members on the first report of the Rhodesia Committee &quot; ; and that the mover and seconder were the only speakers, the motion being agreed to without opposition.   The terms of the memorandum are summarized above.EGYPT.The Alexandria Incident. The following official account of the recent disturbances in Alexandria was telegraphed [No. 254] by Lord Allenby on 23rd May: Late yesterday eveniug collisions occurred in the Hamamil quarter of Alexandria between some Egyptian demonstrators and some low-class Europeans. The real cause-of the outbreak of this phase of the disturbances  has not yet been definitely
44established, but the police think it arose owing to some European firing on a-demonstration from his house. There was considerable firing on both sides, but the Egyptian army and police succeeded at 3 a.m. to-day in restoring order in the quarter. Some hours later further disturbances broke out. Incidents occurred of attacks on Europeans by Egyptians, resulting in much indiscriminate fighting and shooting, Some looting took place, and in the Wardian quarter some acts of-incendiarism ; but fires were reported extinguished or under control before noon. At 9.45 a.m., owing-to-the serious situation, the commandant of the Egyptian police handed over the control to the military authorities; pickets have beeu established, and armoured cars are patrolling the town. No British casualties have been reported. Representations have been made by the Italian and Greek consuls to the local authorities in Alexandria,, and to me by their Ministers in Cairo. So far the list of casualties as reported from hospitals is 37 killed and 151 wounded. The killed were 25 Egpytians, 11 Greeks and 1 Italian girl; and amongst the wounded are 36 Greeks, 12 Italians, 2 French. At 6 p.m. the town is reported practically quiet.   All shops are closed.The situation in Cairo is normal, and no reports of disturbances have been received from the provinces.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., xliii, p. 7]. On 12th and 19th May the Viceroy reported [Nos. 244 and 245] that in Waziristan sniping and raids on a small scale still continued. On the earlier date the column from Meshed was reported as having arrived at Duzdap without incident.The Khyber Railway. Telegraphing [694 S.] on 16th May the Viceroy sent the information that the Afridis and the Afghans, convinced by the embankments and the tunnelling that the new work was for a railway, had, as far as the Afridi divisions were concerned, completed settlement with the Government and accepted contracts. The only exception was the Zakka Khel, whose section of five miles presented few difficulties, and the delay would, not be of much consequence. No success had attended the agitation initiated by the mullahs and the Afghan party against the-railway.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xhii, p. 7].-In a telegram dated 29th April, transmitted [672 S.] by the Viceroy on 11th May, Sir Henry Dobbs, referring to the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 27th April, said that the discussion of unessential s had been practically concluded at the meeting held on 16th April. There were, however, certain points on which he asked for a decision. These included the substitution of Herat for Ghaznl as a consulate should the Afghans press for it; certain verbal alterations regarding the Turkish treaty ; the adherence of Afghanistan to the League of Nations ; -certain boundary considerations; and the necessity of making the payment of a subsidy conditional on the fulfilment of the treaty.The Viceroy followed the transmission by enumerating points regarding the date from which an enhanced rate of subsidy should be calculated, and by making the recommendations of the Government of India on the questions raised by Sir Henry Dobbs.The Secretary of State telegraphed [2525] on 18th May specific replies to each of the points raised in the foregoing telegram. The substitution of Herat for Ghazni as a consulate was agreed to, but it was suggested as advisable to retain the right as regarded Ghazni, in view of possible complications arising from Bolshevik intrigue; the right of Afghanistan to discuss Turkey as relevant to the negotiations was not admitted, but in case the subject became a necessary consideration, Sir Henry Dobbs was authorised to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government desired to see an independent, friendly, and prosperous Turkey; the procedure regarding the admission of Afghanistan to the League of Nations would be telegraphed later; the proposals as to boundary questions were conceded; and it was pointed out that the Viceroy had been left a free hand regarding the subsidy (see below), but that any proposal to remove -the clause making it dependent on the fulfilment of the treaty should be strongly resisted.INDIA.
Previous to this telegram the Secretary of State had telegraphed ou 11th May informing the Viceroy that: His Majesty&apos;s Government had given full consideration to the questions submitted to them by the Viceroy. They understood his view to be that the best form of treaty would be one which would exclude the Russians from Afghanistan; but that failing the possibility of the conclusion of such a treaty, one which would not exclude the possibility of the Afghans obtaining arms and a subsidy from the Russians would be better than no treaty at all.His Majesty&apos;s Government entirely agreed that the first alternative was the most desirable course, and gave unqualified support to the measure of the Government of India going to the limits of their financial capacity in order to attain such a result.The second alternative was one to which His Majesty&apos;s Government could only assent with extreme reluctance, but recognizing that the Viceroy was fully cognizant of all the objections, and of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government, they would be willing to acquiesce in the last resort, should the Viceroy be convinced that in the event of failure on approved lines, it would be better to conclude such, a treaty than to have no treaty at all. In any case, it was,assumed that the conclusion of a treaty would be conditional on the disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty and the cancellation of the consulates on our frontier.The viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following telegrams were sent on 10th and 22nd May:- &apos;    .I. (10th May). Section 1. Bengal. There has been no event of outstanding importance in the non-co-operation campaign, but the increasing number of meetings and minor incidents tend to show how its influence has permeated the province. Recent activities have been directed against the villagers), self-government and obstructing the collection of taxes, and including (sic ? inducing) members of rural bodies and the rural police to resign, particularly the chowkidars. Courts of arbitration are increasing in number, and those refusing to have&apos; recourse to them are threatened with excommunication. The national school movement has, in. most places, proved a definite failure.Section 2. The All-India congress committee has called upon all subordinate committees in Bengal to concentrate attention on (1) the collection of Rs. 16 lakhs for the Tilak swaraj fund; (2) the enlistment of 16 lakhs of congress members; (3) the introduction into villages and homes of three lakhs of spinning wheels.SectionS. No effective attempts have yet&quot; been made to undermine the loyalty of the police. Such disaffection as there is, is confined to up-country constables, and limited more or less to admiration of Gandhi&apos;s personality. The industrial situation is unsatisfactory.Bombay. There has been a recrudescence of violent speaking in the Upper Sincl frontier, and evidence is being collected with a view to prosecution. (? The disturbance) by Tata&apos;s (? frontier) workmen at Mulshi has been held (sic ? hailed) as a triumph of satyagraha by the extremist press. Unrest is prevalent among the men of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India railway.Punjab.-The great majority of agitators among the Sikhs are temporarily quiescent, except amongst the Akali Jathas of the Jullundur division, but the presence of small bodies of troops and police and other precautionary measures have prevented any untoward incident. There has been no noticeable development of agitation in other directions. The main object in view at the moment seems to be the promotion of a scheme of wide enrolment of congress adherents, collection of funds and distribution of spinning wheels. So far this has achieved but a moderate success.The Lahore municipal elections have resulted in an easy win for candidates of the congress and caliphate parties. The control of local bodies would add considerably to the power of the extremists. It is possible that the use they make of this power will increase the number of their opponents, who may be induced to organize them-selves better than, at present.Section 4. Two men have been convicted in the Gujranwala bomb case, in which three rifles, 170 rounds of ammunition, and eight.stick bombs were recovered from the house of a resident in Gujranwala. It has been proved that they had been brought into India from the colony of Hindustani fanatics at Chamrakand for the purpose of committing outrages on Europeans. A press report states that the Gurdwara Prabandkah committee have decided to adopt passive resistance, A list 28-4 13
of persons prepared to resign office has been drawn up, and non-payment of revenue is contemplated. We have no confirmation of this from the local Government. The provincial congress, opened at Pinch this week, reaffirmed the resolution of the Indian national conference on non-violent non-co-operation, on account of the policy of repression culminating in the Punjab tragedy, wanton and deliberate breach of faith regarding the Caliphate, and persistence of an unrepentant Government in repression. They indignantly protested against the application of the Seditious Meetings Act in the Punjab, and the repressive orders of district magistrates in the North-West Frontier province. They viewed with contempt and regarded as an insult the announcement that more pecuniary compensation would be paid to the relatives of those killed at Jallianwala Bagh, and exhorted them not to receive or touch such blood money.section. Central Provinces. Nagpur continues quiet and the conviction of the five men prosecuted for the looting of liquor shops on the 27th March caused no excitement. The extremist leaders are mainly concentrating their efforts on the more effective organization of rural areas, by the establishment of village congress committees and pargana committees. A^olunteers trained in Nagpur are going out as itinerant propagandists to various districts. The effect of the propaganda is shown by &apos;some instances of indignities offered to Government servants. In some places, difficulty is experienced in the collection of rent, but there are no signs at present of any genera] campaign for the non-payment of - rent or revenue. A house to house collection for the swaraj fund is being made, but is unpopular. In Jubbulpur, a leading maulvi has taken a strong line against the non-co-operators and appears to be acquiring a fair following among the local mohamedans. - The friction between the non-co-operators and the untouchables has extended. The latter refuse to join the non-co-operation movement, and put forward extravagant demands for the removal at once of all disabilities of untouchability, with the result that strong feelings have been roused among the orthodox Hindus.Bihar and Orissa. The non-co-operation agitation has been carried on more vigorously during the last fortnight. Public meetings have been more numerous and speeches more violent.Section 6. North-West Frontier Province. Efforts are being made, though with little success, to promote agitation in the rural districts under the guise of religion, and many of the principal khans have been approached with a view to securing the signature of a petition regarding the caliphate question, and have been threatened with a charge of unbelief if they refuse to sign. There are indications of further attempts in the Mansehra Tahsil of Harzara to restart the caliphate movement.In Bannu there has been a definite change for the better. A few more resignations have been received from lambardars, but in a number of cases they have been withdrawn, and some leading mullahs in the district have, definitely declared against the non-co-operation movement, and have issued fatwas that there is no necessity for lambardars and others to resign the government service.Section 7. In Assam a series of lectures on non-co-operation excited considerable interest in Sylhet; more pleaders have suspended practice. Collections for the caliphate fund are on the increase, and progress has been made in the establishment of arbitration courts ; there is no information as to the work done by these courts, but it is reported that a good many cases are being settled out of court. There have been a number of small strikes among the tea garden labour force; there is no doubt that some are the results of the non-co-operation meeting, though of course, economic causes are largely responsible. There has been.no rioting except in one case, and the position has been dealt with patiently and ably by the district staff and managers. The United&apos;Provinces All-India shiah conference unanimously resolved that a deputation should be sent to Nijaf not only to enquire into the bombardment of Najaf Ashraj, but to bring to light any further tyranny. Mohamed Ali made a very violent speech; the religious head of the shiahs of North-West India, however, has written to the Karachi papers, that, from inquiry from a few very reliable pilgrims at Karbala and Nijaf, he is satisfied there was no foundation for the rumours of bombardment, and believes that the insinuation was made through some hostile foreign papers, with a view to prejudice British interests and t!o exploit their own ends.Section 8. General. We have decided that Ah should be prosecuted under section 121 (a), and that proceedings should be instituted against the Independent paper of Allahabad under section 108, Criminal Procedure Code, but that no action should be taken before the 15th May.
The reason for this postponement has been-communicated to you.   Sir H. Butler does not anticipate any difficulty on this account, and we are anxious to leave no stone: unturned to deflect Gandhi.   Mohamed Ali&apos;s open reference to the possible invasion of India by the 26th April is calculated to alienate Hindus and many mohamedans. The period after the middle of May is likely to be a difficult one, as people in rural areas are without occupation and it is the season in which, in towns, crowds gather together.   In Ramazan, too, though physical energy is reduced, the fanatical spirit is; intensified.   We have warned the local Governments of the contemplated prosecution, and steps will be taken, if needful, for the prohibition of meetings of protest, not only in the United Provinces but wherever necessary.   Generally speaking, the situation is certainly no worse than when we reported last.   Unofficial reports indicate that the charka craze is not viewed with favour and collections for swaraj are not successful. There are also increasing indications of dissension in the extremist party among both Hindus and mohamedans, and in  some provinces organizations against hon-co-; operation are trying to attain some success.   -II. (22nd May). Section 1. Madras.-The excitement occasioned by the visit of Gandhi and the Ali brothers in April has worn off, but has left behind it intensified activity on the part of the non-co-operators. The money collected is being spent in paying agitators to tour the country. The movement for the non-payment of municipal taxes is growing. On the other hand, the movement to oppose non-co-operation has made some progress. The local Government issued an order pointing out that it is the duty of government officials to oppose non-co-operation, and to co-operate with. non-officials in combatting the movement.Bombay. Reports from the Upper Sind frontier show-a recrudescence of the violent speaking which occurred there this time last year.Section 2. Prosecutions are being instituted where possible. Swami Govenadnano has been prosecuted under section 124 (a), Indian Penal Code, and sentenced to five years. The jury, all Indians, gave a unanimous verdict. In accordance with the decision of congress, non-co-operators have definitely included the Indian states within their sphere of activity.Section 3. A conference is contemplated this month, nominally to discuss the lines on which reforms should be carried out in the states, but actually to consider, questions such as (a) the amount of a chiefs civil list; (6) the supersession of the political agent in matters of justice and administration by a board presided over by a person with the qualifications of a High Court judge; (c) the inclusion in the Chamber of Princes of representatives of the people; and (d) the removal of certain troublesome articles from old treaties.Section4. The anti-drink campaign continues. The non-co-operators have captured the Surat municipality, but only got 9 seats out of 45 at Karachi, and did badly in the local boards elections at Broach. Gandhi is meeting with opposition in the matter of the inclusion of the co-operative credit society in the non-co-operation programme. The strike in the Buckingham mills is at an end ; normal conditions prevail.Bihar and Orissa. The non-co-operation agitation is carried on rather more vigorously; the public meetings held are more numerous and the speeches more violent. There is considerable activity in the temperance movement; social boycott and intimidation are freely used, not only against the liquor vendors, but also against persons whose conduct is disapproved of by the non-co-operators. Concrete expression is being given to the feeling amongst the Brahmins and Rajputs that the movement as directed by Gandhi involves a levelling process and the obliteration of caste distinction. A conference of Brahmins, Rajputs and Bhumihar Brahmins, decided that the vaisyas and sudras should remain in their present places, their agents touring in the villages proclaiming that Gandhi wishes to outcaste Rajputs. The non-co-operators captured 7 out of the 12 seats of the municipality. The non-co-operators are pledged (a) to refuse to receive government grants for any purpose; (6) to nationalize schools; (c) to abolish the water tax; and (d) to make an all-round increase in the salaries and wages of municipal employees. Vigorous efforts are being made throughout the province to collect money for Gandhi&apos;s swaraj fund.Section 5. United Provinces. Less reliance is now placed on the inflammatory propaganda, and efforts are concentrated on the organization and collection of funds.   .Section 6. Prosecutions continue to be instituted under the ordinary law against seditious speakers. The organization of anti-revolutionary leagues has met with considerable initial success, in spite of setsback in Lucknow and Muttra. Elsewhere, 28-4      -        . C
the meetings elicited considerable support, and in several instances conspicuous success, and the Leader newspaper congratulates the Government on the abandonment of the old autocratic methods in favour of a democratic campaign of persuasion and propaganda. The district conference at Allahabad was very largely attended on 10th May. Gandhi deprecated abuse and violence, and referred to the Afghan bogey. Lajpat Eai stated that they ought not to help the Government in any war, even to ward off an Afghan invasion. Mohamed Ali on the 12th at Allahabad qualified his earlier statements on Afghanistan. No non-co-operators would ever desire an Afghan invasion, but if any foreign Power waged war against: the Government to make India free, they would not render any help to the Government, but would simply watch the fight, as they did not believe in violence, and in an interview he stated his view as.to the duty of mohamedans in regard to a jehad. Gandhi, in a letter to Young India, wrote: &quot;I would, in a sense, certainly assist the Amir of Afghanistan if he waged war against the British Government, that is to say, I would only tell my countrymen that it would be a crime to help a Government, which had lost the confidence of the nation, to remain in power. On the other hand, I would not ask India to raise levies for the Amir.&quot;Punjab, As a result of the postponement of the Gurdwaras Bill, the central Gurdwara committee decided to adopt non-co-operation, but only 40 members out of 176 were present, and only 22 voted for the resolution.Section 7. Since the attitude of the Sikh extremists has hitherto been little, if at all, distinct from that of the avowed non-co-operators, it is unlikely that the decision now reached will bring about any great change. As regards the general political activity, it is reported from some parts of the province that the interest in non-co-operation is waning, whilst in other parts, it is said, the movement is being sustained and is spreading. Zeal has been shown in the anti-liquor campaign, which has met with considerable initial success, but it is too early to say whether the effect of the movement will be more than evanescent. The Namaz movement is also being-pursued vigorously ; its ostensible object is to bring pressure to bear on mohamedans to be regular in their attendance at prayers. The underlying object appears to be to enlarge the number of adherents to the caliphate cause. The tone of the press remains unchanged, and no improvemerrt is noticeable. The only anxiety of the average journalist at present appears to be to write as virulently as he can consistently with his own safety.Section 8. The prosecution of the editor of Akali under section 124 (a), Indian Penal Code, was withdrawn on the accused tendering an unqualified apology and acknowledging the folly and wickedness of the article which encouraged murder.Section 9. Delhi. Things are very quiet here. Non-co-operation is mainly directed to the establishment.,of arbitration courts in the city and collecting recruits and subscriptions. Neither effort has met with much success. There has been some picketing of liquor -shops but no disturbances.   The Sikhs are noticeably calmer.General. The Press Act committee has assembled. AVe discussed the attitude of the Government in Council on Friday last, and (? agreed) that we could accept the repeal of the Press Act provided certain powers were maintained by incorporation in other enactments, especially the power to refuse to accept a declaration by dummies, to extend some measure of protection to the Indian chiefs, to prohibit the circulation of and to confiscate seditious publications, including leaflets, to utilize the services of the customs and postal authorities to seize inflammatory literature, and to provide for (? the confiscation) of presses on a second conviction for seditious libel by order of the judiciary and subject to a right of appeal. We think it will greatly strengthen the moderates if they can go to the country and say they have succeeded in repealing the Press Act, but we are anxious to get the committee to agree to retain the powers stated.There has been an outward improvement in the general situation. The Ali brothers&apos; utterances on Afghanistan and recent direct incitements to violence have caused some misgiving amongst other non-co-operationist leaders, and especially the disclosures of Malaviya regarding the visit of an Afghan emissary to himself and his unqualified denunciation of any tampering with Afghanistan. As a result of protracted interviews with the Viceroy, Gandhi has promised to try and persuade the-Ali brothers to make a public apology for speeches in the past inciting to violence, and to refrain from them in future as long as they are associated with the non-violent non-co-operation movement. If they make this public announcement, we propose to: issue a statement to the effect that we had intended to prosecute, but in view of the
apology for the past and guarantee for the future, have decided not to proceed at present. If they refuse we shall at once; prosecute, also if they break the under-&quot; taking. In the latter event there will be no immunity for speeches delivered prior to it. We are inclined to think that we gain the advantages of prosecution without being exposed to its risks. The loss of prestige and moral effect of the chief non-co-operator appealing to the Government for mercy towards his two principal lieutenants will, we hope, be considerable. We are inclined to the view that some improvement in the general atmosphere may be effected. There is some feeling amongst non-officials that the non-co-operation movement is losing strength for various reasons, and (? there is no doubt that) Hindus have been much frightened by the attitude of the Ali brothers towards Afghanistan.THE DOMINIONS.Limitation of Expenditure on Armaments. On 14th May the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa : The League of Nations letter of 8th March as to the limitation of expenditure on armaments dias been under the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to reply that their policy is entirely in harmony with the spirit of the recommendation adopted in the League Assembly on 14-th December ; that very substantial reductions in their military, naval, and air expenditure have . already been effected; and that in the next two years they look forward to the possibility of further economies, though these must be subject to the reservations mentioned in the recommendation of the Assembly. Before sending the above reply, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to know whether your Ministers assent to it, as they think it important that on this matter the British Empire should speak with - one voice.AUSTRALIA.New Guinea. On 16th May.the Governor-General reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that a civil administration under the authority of the mandate issued by the Council of the League of Nations had been established in the territory of New Guinea, formerly called German New Guinea, as from 9th May 1921, and that the Secretary-General of the League of Nations had been informed thereof.The following items of information were telegraphed to the official secretary in Great Britain by the Prime Ministers department, Melbourne :  &quot;&apos;New Tariff. The new tariff is engaging the close attention of the Federal Parliament now sitting in Melbourne. Forty items, covering.spirits, tobacco, and sugar, have been passed, only slightly altered and without- clashing with the Govern-ment policy. The Minister for Customs, reviewing at one stage a contentious debate, ridiculed an assertion that the tariff would be prejudicial to Australia^ primary industries. Remarking that the protectionist policy of other countries is such as to make the Australian tariff blush for shame at its moderation, the Minister cited the progressive agricultural effect of the generous protection operating in America, Canada, and New Zealand.Embargo on Gold Reserves. Sir Joseph Cook, the Commonwealth Treasurer, has announced that the Federal Government will adhere inflexibly to their policy regarding the Commonwealth gold reserves. As to the current production of gold, however, its export has been unrestricted during the past 16 months, and has totalled during that period over 5,500,OOOZ.Wireless Telephony. The Federal Government are closely studying the development of wireless telephony with a view to its general application. Musical demonstrations given in Melbourne have been clearly received by a steamer 300 miles out.Settlement of Discharged Soldiers--About 15,000 returned soldiers have been settled on the land in Victoria. The million and a half acres occupied by them have cost 13,000,000Z.
Aerial Mail.
