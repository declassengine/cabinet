GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the Reports of the Ministry of Labour, -dated 25th June and 2nd July.The Unemployment Position. On. the 10th- June in the United Kingdom 2,1.53,018 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Act, and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,593,066 were lodged by males and 559,952 by females. At the same date 866,798 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 514.953 were lodged by males and 351,845 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 19,933 workers totally unemployed and a decrease of 314,236 in those working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the .17th June was 2,180,000. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.On the .1.7th June, in the United Kingdom 2,150,653 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,597,373 were lodged by males and -553,280 by females. At the same date, 847,224 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 504,210 were lodged by males and 343,014 by females.These figures show a decrease on the previous week of 2,365 totally unemployed and 19,574 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 24th June was 2,178,000. The above are advanced figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.Conference, of the Labour Party.-The 21st annual conference of the Labour party was held , at Brighton from the 21st to 24th June. In the course of the -consideration of the report of the executive committee, Mr. Hodges took the opportunity presented by a reference to the coal dispute to make a statement explaining the position of the miners, and a resolution in favour of financial support from the rest of the Labour movement was adopted. The report of the executive committee was discussed, and there was little criticism of the paragraph dealing with the need for co-ordination of policy and effort within the movement, and the proposals for the formation of: a national joint council of the Labour party and the trades union congress, except as regards the Labour research department, upon which there was some debate. No decision could be arrived at, however, as negotiations wdth the department itself are still proceeding. The decision of the executive committee in refusing an application from the Communist party for affiliation to the Labour party was ratified by the conference. The abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board was considered, and a resolution was adopted, unanimously calling upon the parliamentary Labour party and. local Labour organizations to use every means in their power to resist the Governments policy. It was announced that a conference to discuss the question of agriculture was to be called, and that organizations specially interested in agriculture would, be asked to send representatives. There was a discussion on the -Governments Irish policy, which was condemned. Mr. Thomas, who was absent on his American visit, was strongly criticized in this connexion because of an alleged speech in favour of dominion home rule shortly after the last annual conference had decided against it. Resolutions demanding the revision of the peace treaties and protesting against an Anglo-French alliance were also passed, and a motion demanding the repeal of the Emergency Powers Act was adopted. In this connexion it was alleged that certain papers were, circulating calumnious stories about members of the Government without any action being taken to refute or restrain them, the suggestion being that the powers conferred by the Act were not being used impartially.A further resolution was adopted without discussion denouncing any sort of alliance between the Labour party and any section of either the Liberal or the Conservative party. The usual resolution on unemployment, calling for work or maintenance, and advocating&quot; schemes for industrial training, was passed after a. debate in which reference to the connexion between the reparation clauses and unemployment was a. salient feature.The new executive elected at the conference consists of 13 representatives of affiliated societies, namely,  Messrs. F. Hodges, J. R. Clynes,  Ben Turner,
Sidney Webb, F. W. Jowett, A. G. Cameron, C. T. Cramp, W. H. Hutchinsou,. J. Bromley, C. Duncan, C. G. Ammon, P. B. Varley, and M. B. Farr; five repre-sentatives from local constituency organizations, namely, Messrs. Ben Spoor, G. Lansbury, Neil MacLean, R. J. Davis, and T. Shaw; and four women members,&apos; namely, Miss Susan Lawrence, Mrs. Harrison Bell, Mrs. Philip Snowden, and Dr. Ethel Bentham.The next conference will be held at Scarborough.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.Approach for Inclusion in the Union of South Africa. The High Commissioner for South Africa-telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 8th June as follows:-The Rhodesia Union Association, in a letter dated. 30th May, has-approached the Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, as bead of the Government, with, a request that conditions for the inclusion of Rhodesia in the Union of South Africa, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Union, may be obtained as soon&apos; as possible. The chairman of the Association requested that the letter should be forwarded to me for transmission to the Government of the Union of South Africa, and for the information of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The letter concludes with the statement that the Association is prepared to send a deputation to England, if it-should be considered necessary, at its own expense for the purpose of laying the-yiews of the Association before you. In accordance with the request made by the Association, I have communicated a copy of the letter to the Government of the Union of South Africa.Referring to the above, the High Commissioner sent the following telegram on 22nd June: The Southern Rhodesia Union Ministers have replied that they have taken a note of the correspondence regarding the requests of the Rhodesia Union Association, but that they do not think it advisable for them to express any opinion on the inclusion of Southern Rhodesia in the Union, until such time as the Union of South Africa is&quot;approached by the properly constituted authority empowered with the duty of dealing with this matter. lam communicating the Ministers&apos; reply to the Administrator.WEST INDIES.Passenger Steamship Service. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has issued a memorandum, in. which he states that, after consultation with the Imperial Shipping Company, and having obtained the concurrence of the Treasury, he is proposing to call for tenders at an early date, with a view to resuming in 1922-23 the mail service to the West Indies, which fell into abeyance during the war, the cessation being considered as a war measure. The Secretary of State considers that a regular: passenger service is essential to these colonies for the purposes of commerce and development.The West Indian colonies have been invited to contribute to the cost of a trans-atlantic service. Trinidad, which at present is served by a Dutch line, which calls there only, is unwilling, at the moment, to do so, but both British Guiana and Barbados have offered to contribute. It is understood that certain of the Windward Islands will also be prepared to contribute, although it is not proposed that any of those colonies should be directly served by the intended mail service. The TVeasury having agreed to the principle of a contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Government, Mr. Churchill proposes to request the authority of the Cabinet for a Treasury contribution, to be decided on between the Treasury and the Colonial Office.MESOPOTAMIA.The general Situation. The following telegram [No. 216] was sent by the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 21st-June:- Our deliberation at the Cairo conference and the conclusions resulting therefrom as far as Mesopotamia are concerned were admittedly based on the assumption of a
friendly Turkey. Subsequent developments having demonstrated that the assumption is not now a tenable one, it is necessary to reconsider the position in the light of existing facts, which I beg to summarize.It was reported in my telegram No. 152 of 1st -June that Burhan Al Din. is Mustafa Kemals candidate for Mesopotamia.In my telegram of 13th April, No. 29, I drew attention to a number of incidents on the Mosul border. Since then there has been a further series of attacks on keleks, compelling the 18th Division to despatch a column to the route-march area. This -cannot be expected to have a permanent effect as the enemy shelter within the French sphere.I have received to-day a report from Kirkuk, anuouucing the arrival at Bowanduz of a Kemafist officer with 37 men from Neri; they have immediately started pro-paganda among the tribes, and as a result there are signs of considerable uneasiness in that neighbourhood.I have told you already that as the prospect of ail Arab Government is beginning to materialize the public like it less, and seeing that the continuance of the British administration is out of the question, a considerable section are inclined to hark back to the devil they know. It is clear that the latest reports front the Euphrates division that these sentiments are gaining considerable vogue.I merely report these developments as a preliminary warning that the programme of military reduction, considered reasonably safe on the basis of our Cairo clelibera-tions, can be so regarded no longer. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief and myself will make separately any concrete specific proposals for the modification thereof which may seem to be required. From the political point of view, the best and in fact the only weapon we shall have wherewith to combat a possible campaign of Turcb-Bolshevism from Angora, and perhaps from Teheran, will be a solid block of Arab nationalism, and our policy must be to foster that to the utmost and give it all the material support we can. From this point of view the delay of your promised announcement is most regrettable : but-it gives us time to reconsider the situation in the light of the recent Turkish news, and I shall, if I may, make suggestions from the local point of view as to what you might conveniently say to promote the above policy.INDIA.The Frontier Sit nation. The Viceroy telegraphed [1.071] on 23rd June thereport from Waziristan that in the Wana districts the Waziris&apos; activities appeared to be slackening.   The Mahsuds were continuing to act on the offensive.Telegraphing [1123] on 30th June the Viceroy said that reports had been received of minor collisions with small, parties of hostile tribes in the Wana and Ivohat areas.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xlvi, p. 6]. Previous reports from Sir Henry Dobbs telegraphed [871 S.] by the Viceroy on 15th June had indicated that the absence of a satisfactory decision and formula regarding AVaziristan had proved a stumbling-block to further prosecution of the treaty with&apos;Afghanistan. On this date the Viceroy telegraphed to Sir Henry that the Governor-General in Council had decided to issue announcements to the Mahsuds and the Wana Waziris. These announcements were to embody the intention to hold the central Mahsucl line with regular troops, and to withdraw regulars from Wana, as soon as settlement with them permitted, and to hold it with Waziri khassadars. At the same time administration on generous lines was promised. These announcements were to be dependent on an exclusive treaty being actually concluded.On 19th June the Viceroy transmitted [896 S.] a message from Sir Henry in which the latter reported that he had informed Tarsi that he was in a position to make an announcement regarding Waziristan policy. At a meeting with the Afghan representatives on 17th June he had informed them of the terms of the announce-ment, making it clear to them that the announcement would not be made immediately on the signature of the treaty, but &quot; immediately on the open severance of political relations between Afghanistan and Russia.&quot; The Afghans had appeared to be quite content with the terms of the announcement.   On 16th June the Amir had seen30-1B
Surits and Rosenburg, and had informed them that he coidd not ratify the treaty with Russia until it had been further considered by his Council.At the meeting with Tarsi, Sir Henry had confirmed the offer of munitions, and had explained the stages of procedure as recommended by the Council of India.. Tarsi had agreed to the publication of the treaty immediately on signature, and gave his opinion that the Russian legation would take its departure immediately thereon. He had then asked. Sir Henry for a provisional letter, stating our Waziristan proposals and the terms regarding munitions and the break with Russia, in order to put it before the Amir and his Ministers in Council. . If the Council agreed, the treaty was to be put at once into final shape.   Sir Henry had supplied the letter accordingly.The Viceroy telegraphed [898 S] on 21st June that Sir Henry Dobbs reported that Tarsi was genuinely ill on 18th June, and the consideration of his letter by the-Amir and his Council had been postponed until 19th June.Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; report of the 21st June was transmitted [935 S.] by the Viceroy on 23rd June, and was to the effect that at a meeting held on the date of his report,, the Afghans put forward alterations in our proposals which they asserted were their minimum demands, arrived at by the Council after two days&apos; discussion. These alterations were : (1) That the subsidy of 40 lakhs should be reckoned from the date of the Rawalpindi treaty. This Sir Henry Dobbs had said was out of the question, and although the Afghans said that otherwise the treaty would be impossible, he thought it was fairly certain that they would give way. (2) The number of rounds of ammunition per rifle and Lewis gun should be ultimately 2,000, with an extension over two years as the period for delivery, provided Avar with Russia did not break but during the interval. Sir Henry had replied that the amount asked for was excessive,, but he would enquire whether the British Government would contemplate an increase-over 200 rounds per rifle within a period of two years. The Afghans asserted that they had been promised 2,000 rounds per rifle by the Russians. (3) The rounds per-gun to be 300 instead of 100, also over an extended time. Sir Henry had expressed his doubt if this could be done, but had undertaken to enquire. (4) The immediate delivery of six aeroplanes, in order to give the Afghan people confidence, notwith--stancling the fact that the Government realized that nothing could be done with them.. until Afghan pilots had been trained.The continuation of the above was telegraphed [940 S.J by the Viceroy on 24th June. Regarding the aeroplanes, Sir Henry Dobbs had replied that no army -aeroplanes could be spared at present, but that he would enquire if the period of six. months for getting them together could be shortened. (5) The Afghans had proposed certain additions to the treaty regarding previous consultation or exchange of views,, as to a &quot; political &quot; treaty with any third State. (6) The complete evacuation of the Mahsttd country as well as the VYana Wazir country, and the remission of fines and the balance of rifles. The Afghans had asserted that no treaty could be effected unless we gave way on this point, on which they apparently felt very strongly. Sir Hemy, after long argument, had said that the limit of our concessions had been, reached.Continuing the above in a later telegram [915 S.] Sir Henry reported that he bad told the Afghans that if they rejected the enormous concessions that we had offered, we should adopt our own frontier policy, and the tribes would learn of the generous proposals made by us in their interests, which the Afghans had rejected in favour; of a Bolshevik alliance. Sir Henry had said that he had given them a clear indication of his views, but he must have time to consider, and he wished to see the Amir before the Afghans reached their final decision.Referring to the foregoing telegrams, the Viceroy telegraphed [947 S.] on 25th dune that he had sent a reply to Sir Henry Dobbs in the following sense. After-expressing the confidence of the Government of India in Sir Henry&apos;s ability to cope with the difficulties which confronted him, he suggested that, while anxious not. to-fetter him in his conduct of the negotiations, the time had come to make a stand against Afghan voracity. Taking the Afghan minim tun demands seriatim : (1) The rejection of the Afghan demand regarding the subsidy, which would mean the undesirable-payment of a large lump sum down, was approved by the Government of India. (2) The request for a free gift of 2,000 rounds per rifle and Lewis gun within two years was out of the question, and the Government of India thought Sir Henry should not exceed his provisional promise of 100. rounds with each rifle and a further 100s rounds later on.   The 1,000 rounds per Lewis gun could not be increased.   (3) An
additional 100 rounds per gun, over an extended period, might he conceded if Sir Henry.found himself hard pressed.&apos; (4) Six military aeroplanes in working order could not be supplied in less than six months. (5) The Afghan formula regarding the formation of a treaty with a third power could not be accepted, the words &quot; political treaty &quot; being in themselves objectionable and being conducive to evasion and pre-varication. (IS) Finally, the Government of India approved Sir Henry s attitude on the tribal question, note being made of the fact that the Wana Waziris were calling for regulars to be stationed at Wana in order to protect them from the Mahsuds and Suleiman Kbel.On 30th June the Viceroy transmitted [991 S.] a report from Sir Henry Dobbs that he had met the Afghan representatives on 27th June, and had given them the final replies on the points raised at their last meeting as set forth in the Vicer6y&apos;s telegram preceding. Before giving these replies he had given them a-written note regarding the British attitude, recording our reasons for desiring Afghan friendship and the conditions attaching to that desire, and finally our fixed intention of maintaining the security of India, with or without Afghan friendship. The Afghan representatives, although exhibiting a more than usually polite demeanour, gave no indication of what their decision was likely to be. Sir Henry reported that he himself had misgivings as to their attitude, and feared there might be difficulties ahead.   No further meeting had yet been arranged.The ViceroyV Weekly Reports.-The following telegrams were sent on 21st June and 1st July : - -I. (21st June). Madias. -Non-co-operation is active, and in the northern Sircars there is undoubtedly a general atmosphere of opposition to constituted authority. In one district a boycott of Government servants is reported. The authorities are taking-active steps to prevent the intimidation of those visiting liquor shops, and the result seems to be a reaction against the temperance movement. Enquiries so far made into the escape from the Trichinopoly jail previously reported show some ground for believing it to be political, and based on the belief that British rule was on the point of yielding to Gandhi&apos;s swaraj.The magistrate at Calicut has issued orders prohibiting caliphate and non-co-operation meetings for two months.Punjab. The cleavage between the extremist and the moderate Sikhs is increasing&quot;. No trouble is anticipated in the realization of the land revenue. Some activity is&apos; shown in enrolling members for the congress and collecting subscriptions for the swaraj fund, but the enthusiasm for the latter is waning. There has been an exposure of the maladministration of the caliphate committee and an unwillingness to contribute. The few persons advocating the non-payment of revenue and taxes are being proceeded against under section 107.Section 2. In Lahore, the congress party invited the entire population of the municipality to join the city congress committee, and attempted to hold a so-called committee meeting. The number of the committee is stated to exceed 5,000. The meeting -was prohibited by the district magistrate. The congress party is also endeavouring tb start arbitration courts in the different wards of the city. The-temperance campaign continues and, though there is less interference with customers, greater pressure is being exercised through the panchayats to bring about the social boycott of non-abstainers.Section 3. Ivitcblu has reported on the accounts of the provincial caliphate committee. He finds the dissatisfaction of the public justified ; the accounts were carelessly and possibly dishonestly kept, and the expenditure was on an inordinately extravagant scale.Delhi. The local caliphate committee held a private meeting to consider the future programme and appoint a new committee, having taken a little heart on the expiry of the Seditious Meetings Act, butt-here is very little political interest to-record.   The boycotting of liquor shops suddenly ceased.United Provinces. The peace associations appear to be succeeding, and anti-non-co-operation meetings have been reported at several places. There are other-indications that the non-co-operation movement is not progressing much at the moment..Section 4. North-West Frontier Province. Some 25 returning mahajarins, residents of Lahore, Delhi, Bombay and elsewhere, have reached Peshawar. Some of them state they were allowed to return home on agreeing to act as bolshevik agents, and there is some reason for thinking they are actually such agents.
Section. 5. We have received an intimation that they are in fact bolshevik agents, and propose to send them to their homes, when we know their identity, under police surveillance, and ask the local Governments to keep any of them they consider advisable under such restrictions as they think suitable.General. We have to hand very few detailed reports from the provinces. We have kept you separately acquainted with events in Assam, but otherwise the situation is quiet, save in East Bengal, where the conditions are much disturbed, and the railway strike and the boycott movement are causing great trouble.Section C. The heat has been excessive and little conducive to activity, but it has not prevented violent speeches in support of the Angora Government by Abul Kalam Azad and Mahomed Ali. Our general appreciation of the present political situation is summarized below.Section 7. There are hopeful signs which indicate that the leaders of the move-ment are less confident of success, and that some of them are less bitter. There is no doubt that the apology of the Ali brothers has reduced their influence, and was a great set-back to certain sections of the non-co-operation party. The most critical, season of the year is nearly at an end, and we have considered whether any relaxation in policy is desirable. There are still, however, many disquieting symptoms, especially (1) there is but little sign of the slackening of activity in the campaign against the industries of the country, especially those in which European capital&apos; is invested ; (2) there are emissaries of unrest in the guise of sadhus and fakirs, whose propaganda is variously described as pan-islamic, bolshevik or non-co-operationist, who continue to travel about the country, especially in Bengal, Bihar, Assam and the United Provinces ; (3) the leaders show no less eagerness to explore any movement which may embarrass the Government or lead to civil disorder. Whilst the move-ment may be said to have failed in regard to the educated classes, it still exercises great influence over the masses, who in many quarters proclaim Gandhi as their ruler. Moreover, it is not safe to assume that the change for the better is permanent, or that the non-co-operation movement is of less menace to the general peace of the country. We have decided, therefore, that there should be no relaxation of policy in regard to prosecutions for incitement to violence, direct or indirect, and we. are impressing on the local Governments the necessity of watching and prosecuting local agitators. As to the leaders, the Government of India do not wish to interfere with the discretion of the local Governments, but have decided that no prosecution which is likely, in the opinion of the local Government, to affect the general situation in more than one province, should be instituted without the previous approval of the Govern-ment of India. At the same time, we have suggested that the local Governments should consider the advisability of extending to other and less prominent offenders than the Ali brothers the same concession that was given to them, and on the same conditions.We have proposed the formation of armed police battalions in view of the reduction in the number of internal security troops, and have advocated a wider use of personal propaganda on the part of members, ministers, commissioners and district officers in explaining the aims and policy of the Government, with a. view &quot;to break down what has been described as the barrier of silence.II. (1st July.) Bombay. The lull in the non-co-operation activity in Sind continues, and the anti-non-co-operation organizations begin to assert themselves with more confidence. The meetings of the non-co-operators have been less well attended, and the press of the province as a whole begins to be more robust in the denunciation of their propaganda and methods.The attendance at the political caliphate conferences at Broach was compara-tively small, and the speeches indicate that there is but little hope of the realization of the Bezwada programme by 30th June. The Bombay Chronicle and other non-co-operation papers are endeavouriug in vain to rehabilitate the Ali brothers in popular estimation. There is active canvassing for the All-India caliphate conference at Karachi on 1st July. The extreme sections of the caliphate party may press for the adoptiomof civil disobedience and the extreme elements in Hindu circles may exploit the failure of the&quot;Bezwada programme. Attempts may be made to stampede. Gandhi into the acceptance of civil disobedience.Section 2. Bengal. Direct trouble in connexion with the coolies exodus is subsiding, but the indirect effects are still prominent. The strike on the Assam-Bengal railway continues, but a press report just received states the strike of steamer crews at Goalundo, Chandpur and Barisal, has ended, all the men having joined.
The strike is very unpopular in Eastern Bengal, and its organizers are much criticized. The treatment of the migratory coolies on their return to their homes has created some doubt as to the wisdom of the exodus. Sympathy with the coolies, however, has been expressed in numerous hartals.Section 3. There is still a deliberate attempt to boycott Europeans and loyal Indians and molest them by intimidating servants into quitting work, and by means of a system, of permits signed by a local committee without which the shopkeepers will not sell. The boycott of the courts conducted by the bar in certain places is inconveniencing litigants.The recrudescence of objectionable oratory resulted in four prosecutions under sections 1*J4a and 153a. On the whole there has been some deterioration in the situation in Eastern Bengal. The railway and steamer strikes were widespread and almost avowedly political. 0. R. Das, in a lengthy statement in the press, glorified in the &quot; national (corrupt group) &quot; of strikes. In some places, new and oppressive measures of social boycott and annoyance are being put into force. Resentment among the non-official Europeaus is growing and being voiced with some emphasis.United Provinces. Owing to the abnormal heat political energy is at a low ebb. Time also has contributed to diminish the attraction of a movement based on negative principles and supported by recurrent paroxysms of agitation which are now losing novelty and developing causes of cleavage. Anti-non-co-operation meetings have been more successful. With a good monsoon the cultivator may be expected to return to his traditional occupation from the lure of revolutionary politicians. -Section 4. The apology of the Ali brothers is still the main topic of discussion;.&apos; opinions vary, some depict the apology as an instance of their heroic spirit, others as an unfortunate defeat ; in some quarters it is regarded as a diplomatic victory by the Viceroy over simple-minded patriots, and in others it is characterized as an undignified retreat; the general impression of the man in the street is that the Ali brothers have done something astute, and. thereby escaped a lengthy incarceration. The apology is not regarded as serious, the more sophisticated regarding the episode as fail achievement, but not as a real victory.Section 5. In view of their apology and the relieved tension in the political atmosphere, the uniform practice of prosecuting for seditious utterances in all cases is being re-examined. Recantations in court are accepted, and warnings are issued, in actionable (? omission); success has been achieved at present, but it is necessary to consolidate and prepare for a fresh attack which will probably take a different form.Bihar and Orissa, There is a lull in the non-co-operation movement, and GandhiV influence is reported to be less powerful. The number of meetings has declined and violent speaking decreased. Agitation against Europeans is reported to, be less evident, and planters are no longer so apprehensive of trouble. The agitation against the sale of liquor seems to be declining, though this portion of the non-co-operation movement has received more sympathy and support than any other part of it. The industrial situation is quiet: there have been rumours of a strike in the coalfields during rains, but these are unconfirmed.Central Provinces. There is a lull in political agitation, and several districts report some decline in the non-co-operation movement. The commissioner thinks that there are signs of people getting tired of non-co-operation. There are small audiences at non-co-operation meetings, people of substance leaving the village when the speakers arrive.   The speakers are unable to get food.Section 6. The Ali brothers&apos; apology caused some stir among the mohamedans of Nagpur, who do not like it. At Jubbulpore, the moulvi who leads the anti-non-co-operation party had a larger audience at the Id prayers. There has been no further violence in the picketting of the liquor shops.Assam. There has been no further exodus of coolies from Karimganj, where 500 or 600 are still collected ; about 100 have returned to one Indian-owned garden. The railway strike caused some interruption of communications. The coolie exodus from the Surma valley has ceased. The Assam-Bengal railway strike continues in the Surma valley, but the men in the Brahmaputra valley are still working.Section 7. The mohameclan Minister, whose home is in Sylhet, gives disquieting accounts of the effects of the non-co-operation propaganda ; he states that in. Sylhet there are on an average in each sub-division 10 paid preachers who preach disloyalty broad-cast, realize the subscriptions and organize village committees; there are also many honorary workers and through the district is spread a network of the organization 30-1 O
which, is creating a hatred of the Government and of Europeans. A special official with an Indian assistant has been appointed to organize counter-propaganda.Section 8. North-West Frontier Province. All districts report a continued decrease in the political agitation.Burma. The announcement of the second reading of the Government of Burma Bill in the House of Lords and the recommendation by the Standing Committee of the appointment of. a local enquiry through the post lias been, received with scorn by the majority of the vernacular newspapers. A serious assault was committed in Rangoon on a European by Indian mohamedans attending the funeral of a prominent moslem resident. An engineer who met the funeral procession was dragged out, of his motor-car and badly handled ; his condition is reported to be serious.Section 9. Punjab. The Sikh situation in the central Punjab is somewhat easier, but there has been considerable agitation amongst the Sikhs at Jhalim. The arrest of two Sikhs armed with revolvers at Lahore, and repoi;ted in the telegram, of 9th June, is expected to lead to further devekrpments. There is no sign in the Punjab of a recrudescence of the caliphate agitation.General. -Except in Bengal, and Assam, the situation is either unchanged or distinctly improved. The development in Eastern Bengal and Assam, where the weapon of political strife lias been employed, gives us some cause for anxiety, but as the swaraj funds have been set apart for one month only in payment of strike wages, and as the monsoon has now broken, we hope the trouble will subside. The date (30th June) fixed for the collection of the crore of rupees and the crore of workers for swaraj is now at hand, and feverish efforts are being made to achieve these objects, but both, fall far short of the, goal. On the other hand the tension between Great Britain and the Angora Government, and the allegations of help given to the Greeks has led to a recrudescence of the extreme caliphate agitation in Bihar, the United Provinces, and Bombay.Section 10. Violent resolutions have been passed at several meetings, and Kalam Azad and Abdul Bari have issued manifestos to the effect that it is the duty of all moslems to support the Angora Government at any cost. Mohauied Ali, in a recent article in the Bombay Chronicle, written on the Angora Government, stated that mohamedans should, if possible, adopt non-violent methods to secure their objects, but if they fail they must use such force as they have.Section 11. This goes near the breach of the undertaking recently given, but he is much discredited. The All-India caliphate conference meets at Karachi on 1st July. We have asked Bombay to make special arrangements to secure an accurate report of the speeches delivered.THE DOMINIONS.Naval Prize. On 30th June the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following telegram to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and to the Governor of Newfoundland : The position in regard to Droits of the Crown has been regulated by the Naval Prize Act of 1918, and His Majesty&apos;s Government desire me to communicate the following for the consideration of Ministers with a view to the disposal of other matters connected with Naval Prize.No Orders in Council under section 8 of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act of 1890 have been issued, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are advised that in law Droits of Admiralty wherever seized belong to the Imperial Exchequer, and they are ready to dispose of outstanding matters in regard to oversea prize on. the footing that the rights and liabilities arising from seizures in which the Naval Prize Fund is not concerned attach to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Alternatively His. Majesty&apos;s Government are willing to waive, in favour of the. Dominion Governments concerned, their rights in the condemned prizes not adjudged to the Naval Prize Fund, which are condemned within the Dominions, on the under-stahcling-(1) that the Dominion Governments, assume liability for uurecovered expenditure connected with all local prize actions, both Droits of the Crown and Droits of Admiralty, including legal expenses, compensation for wrongful seizure
and grants made on the recommendation ol the Prize Claim Committee ; (2) that no claim is made by His Majesty&apos;s Government or the Dominion Government concerned in respect of the hire or earnings of prize ships utilized by the other, refund being made of any sums already paid by either party on this account, subject to allowance for actual, expenses incurred by lending the Government during the period of the loan, such allowance to cover running expenses, but not constructive expenses such as interest on capital, depreciation, &amp;c.; (3) no claim to be made by either party in respect of the value of a ship taken up by the other party and lost while in its service.The phrase &quot; unrecovered expenditure,&apos;&apos; is intended to cover all expenses connected with prize proceedings, the repayment for which cannot be obtained by charges .against the claimants,.or against the proceeds of. the sale, or in the case of Droits of the Crown by claims against the Naval Prize Fund.These proposals are put forward on the assumption that the scheme as a whole,the choice of one of the two courses mentioned, is accepted by all the Dominions, .and must be regarded as subject to withdrawal if this is not the case.The proposals will not affect the liability of the Dominion Governments towards the Naval Prize Fund in respect of any Droits of the Crown which have been requisitioned by them, and it should be understood that settlement in accordance with the second plan involves the withdrawal of the arrangement suggested in my Despatch, 3rd November .1916, concerning the remuneration of officers and the payment of fees.A similar telegram is being sent to the other Dominions, and I should be glad to be informed of the views of your Ministers at an early date.Special Renter Service [B.E.R., xli, p. 10]. On 22nd dune the Secretary -of State for the Colonies informed, the Governor-General of South Africa, the Governors of the Straits Settlements, Hong Kong, Kenya, and Nyasalancl, the Officer Ad-ministering the Government of Uganda, and the Resident, Zanzibar, that the Special Renter Service replies received from the participating Governments showed that there was not a sufficient measure of support to justify the continuance of the service after 30th June, and that it had accordingly been decided to discontinue it after that date.AUSTRALIA.Trade and Financial Prosperity. The following statement has been issued from the Commonwealth offices in London : Mr. Hughes states that Australia continues to make steady recovery from the adverse trade conditions experienced in the earlier part of this year. The latest trade returns of the Commonwealth show that twice since that period the monthly exports have exceeded imports to an appreciable extent, though the total exports so far are under the value recorded for the corresponding period of last year. The solid success of the May and June series of wool sales has restored general confidence and revived trading activities. The finances are officially reported to be in a very healthy condition, and revenue is coming in well.SOUTH AFRICA.German Goods undercutting British. ReuteFs Port Elizabeth agent, telegraphing on 15th June, reported that at the annual meeting of the Chamber of Commerce the president spoke as follows : &quot;Many of us have not handled German goods, but we must now seriously consider whether it is not futile to attempt to ignore the commercial activities of 70,000,000 of people. The Germans are at work again and supply certain goods below American or British cost. The up-country man considers price, and if we decline to handle German goods it is useless to import British or American goods to sell at a loss.&quot;
