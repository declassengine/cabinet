GREAT BRITAIN.The Unemployment Situation. The following paragraph is taken from the special report on unemployment [No. 63] issued by tbe Ministry of Labour for tbe week ending 31st March : Apart from tbe position in the engineering and shipbuilding industry, which is affected by the lock-out, there are signs of improvement in some industries and in others indications of a position which is no worse than stationary. In coal-mining the position is good in.some areas and, generally, men are being absorbed. In iron and steel there is, on the whole, a slight improvement. In shipbuilding and ship-repairing the future prospects are bad, but the amount of repairing work available, although small, shows some improvement. The effect of. the lock-out on the engineering industry is not uniform, and in some areas is far less serious than was anticipated. The slight improvement in the motor engineering section is maintained. Improvement in the cotton trade is again &quot;reported, although it does not, as yet, indicate an early general return to full-time work. The woollen industry continues to show improvement, and in the jute trade discharges are decreasing, and there is considerably more work on hand. Hosiery is also improving, and there is some indication of a revival in two branches of the lace trade. There is no marked improvement in the boot and shoe industry, but a general revival in the clothing and making-up trades is indicated. Building is slowly improving, and the demand for plasterers, painters and decorators is good, but trades concerned with building supplies are generally slack. There is an indication of some temporary renewal of activity at the docks, although this is by no means general. The reduction in Government establishments is shown in heavy discharges throughout the South of England.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.IRAQ.Draft Treaty with King Feisal [B.E.R., Ixvi, p. 2].-On 25th February the High Commissioner received a letter from King Feisal dated 23rd February, of which the following is a translation :-I have received the modifications made in the treaty by His Majesty&apos;s Colonial Office of which you supplied me with a copy. I told you when you discussed them with me on Wednesday personally that what I aimed at was to be able to serve my country and safeguard the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The two objects are bound up together and are inseparable from each other. I came here with this sole object in view, and, after having urged upon Mr. Churchill that my ability to execute this duty depended on my being given a free hand for my work and being able to demonstrate to the people that I was the real ruler. This is one point. Another point is that the moral upheaval which prevails in the East makes it necessary that I should come before the world, with a free treaty such as would silence all enemies. Otherwise, my labours must be doomed to failure. Accordingly, Mr. Churchill agreed to exchange the mandate for a treaty.His Majesty the King referred to that in the telegram which he was pleased to send me on the occasion of my coronation, in which he stated that the relations between Great Britain and Iraq would be regulated by a treaty of alliance and friendship.Your Excellency will undoubtedly remember that, in answer to my request at the time of the coronation as to the necessity of clearing up the question of responsibility, Mr. Churchill wired to your Excellency expressing the view that it was necessary that I should appear before the people as far as was possible as the real ruler pending the conclusion of the projected treaty.Although I felt that delay in defining the political status- of the country and in the conclusion of the treaty was very prejudicial, both morally and materially harmful to my position, seeing that such delay would afford an opportunity for wavering and for widening the door of intrigue which was on the point of being closed as the result of the general elections, I still was confident that the past evils could be remedied. I regret, however, that what I feared would happen as a consequence of delay did actually happen. I nevertheless entertained sanguine hopes from the arrival of Major Young bearing the necessary instructions and from the
opening of the negotiations with your Excellency in regard to the basis of the treaty. I was sure that the foundations which we were agreed upon would not be met with any objection on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government in London. God knows that I have exerted my best efforts to establish a strong foundation for tlie future relation of the Iraqis with Great Britain, on a basis of everlasting friendship and not on one of compulsion. I and the Prime Minister were in complete agreement on the -question of those principles.Your Excellency may have observed, during your discussions with the Prime Minister with regard to the mandate, that he was more particular and insistent.than myself as to the necessity of the abrogation of it from henceforward. This old and venerable shaikh has spared no effort in advising me from time to time not to -embark on any measure likely to create a critical situation. We were all happy at the completion of the discussions and hopeful that His Majesty&apos;s Government would -agree to the contents of the provisions arrived at and would crown our endeavours by their acceptance of the same, so that we might celebrate the satisfactory solution arrived at and work, hand in hand in co-operation with Great Britain for the interest -of both nations.Now that I have seen the modifications which it is proposed to be introduced into the fundamental provisions of the treaty I am unable to disguise from your Excellency the great disappointment to the hopes which I had entertained for the success of our negotiations which covered a period of over two months, during which we discussed every word of it in a spirit of&apos; complete friendship until we arrived at -a final conclusion. 1 had hoped that the settlement at which we had arrived would be received with approval in London. May God bear witness that in that hope I -and the Prime Minister did. all we possibly could to reach a solution.Now. after further discussion of the subject with his Highness, who, 1 have no doubt, has communicated the result to your Excellency, we have found that the modifications introduced in the treaty make it impossible for us to undertake any -obligations on this basis vis-a-vis Great Britain. The provisions we formerly agreed upon are the least possible if we are to be able to fulfil our duty towards the country, retain the friendship.of-Great Britain, and avoid failure before the world.Should your Excellency hold a different opinion on the matter I would suggest the postponement of the treaty pending the convention of the Constituent Assembly which can be convened in a short space of time. Sincerity, however, constrains me -to state in advance that in such event a field will be opened for a conflict of different Inclinations. At this juncture .1 do not care to disguise the thoughts which crossed my mind with regard to the memorandum you have forwarded in connexion with the modifications, explaining the reasons which led the Minister of the Colonies to introduce these modifications into our draft. I am aware that it is not within my power to resist the establishment of the mandate should Great Britain insist on it, nor to change her policy declared through Air. Fisher in November, nor the attitude she has adopted towards the said mandate. It, however, appears to me that she can, if she so desires, exchange this mandate for a treaty of alliance, framed on the terms which we have accepted.I regret to hold an. opinion, different from that held by Mr. Churchill as regards the -action of the French Government. The mandate which France claims in respect of Syria requires her to act with complete honesty and sincerity : she has no right to dispose of the country as a private owner by alienating what she pleases without permission of those who entrusted her with the mandate. At least it was her duty to consult them in such matters before putting them into execution. If under the -circumstances it is right for France, who is one of the chief members of the Society of Nations, to surrender -to&apos; the enemies of the Allies an. extensive portion of the country entrusted to her, and that for the purpose of safeguarding her private interests and without considering it necessary to consult her Allies and those who have conferred on her the power of attorney, why then is it not equally permissible for Great Britain- to whom has been entrusted the interests of this country in order to lead her on in the light of that high principle, the principle of assisting the people in a spirit of sincerity and friendship, to exchange certain ambiguous words for a definite statement providing for a sincere and friendly alliance, which will rejoice the people and bring tranquillity and confidence to them ? The people have acquired a repugnance towards the term &quot;mandate&quot; and its interpretations, the result of what they have observed in the way of abuse by the mandatory of his mandate and his employment of the authority vested in him under the said mandate for the realization of private aims and objects.
I should not withhold from your Excellency the fact that I, in the same wray. as all the people of the East, consider Great Britain directly responsible before the Society of Nations and to the peoples which have been placed under the French mandate, for the acts of France, seeing that it was Great Britain wdio handed the people over to France, her associate in the Society of Nations, and in the name of the &quot; mandate &apos;&apos; has parcelled out that one country and one people, who have not undergone such a misfortuue for centuries. Is Great Britain in a position officially to declare that France has violated the terms of her mandate and to ask her to fulfil her duties and call upon the Society of Nations to assist in preventing France from exceeding the limits of the mandate? I do not believe that such steps are possible under existing circumstances. That being so the only thing left us is to ask Great Britain to do -what she considers vital and necessary for the people who have been entrusted to her care and to give up her insistence on certain terms, the outcome of which is hurt, and the creation of doubts and scepticism as between her and this country, and to abide instead by the spirit of these terms and undertake to render the people the assistance rendered by an ally. Such a course would pacify minds which are-full of apprehensions on account of the mandate. It will increase the people&apos;s confidence in Great Britain and in her actions and will lead them to join with her in free friendly and honest co-operation. She will gain their everlasting gratitude for having delivered them from the tyranny of the Turks and from the injustice of the-unjust and unfair foreign capitulations.. This is the most effective means available for the safeguarding of common interests and the ensurauce of peace and tranquillity in the country and its progress on the road of development.God. knows that I regret what took place in regard to my &quot; declaration.&quot; I remember you had asked me for a written one and I was prepared to give it. Your Excellency may remember that I was prepared to sign it when I visited you; all I had to say was that as I.was not aware of the nature of the undertakings referred to, I must, in signing the document, leave to your Excellency&apos;s honour the future responsibility that might result therefrom. Yon, however, thought it expedient to-postpone signature pending the despatch of a telegram to London. Apart from this, our draft provides with complete clearness that I undertake to see to the execution of all the international obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government.On 16th March the&apos;!Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed [No. .182] as follows to the High Commissioner: King FeisaPs attitude, with which I am disappointed, seems to show little appreciation of the lengths to meet his wishes to which we have already gone.   We-have offered to place- our relations with him on the basis of a treaty concluded inter pares by two sovereign States, and we are prepared so to word the preamble that ail reference to mandatory authority is omitted.   He is not satisfied with this and demands that the mandate be formally abrogated.   We find it impossible to agree to-this.   Insuperable international difficulties at this end would, be raised by a communi-cation to the Allies and the League of Nations in the sense suggested.   It must be remembered that the right has been given to us to conclude a treaty with King Feisal only by the existence of the mandate.   Iraq would revert to the status of a conquered Ottoman territory if the mandate disappeared and the country&apos;s ultimate disposal could,be determined only by agreement between the allied Powers.   All legal claim to a special position in Iraq on. which the whole policy ef the treaty depends would be forfeited by Great Britain if the mandate were abandoned.   We could no doubt enter into treaty relations with the independent State of Iraq, if and when the conclusion of peace with Turkey had legalized its independent status ; but the rights acquired under such a treaty could not be exclusive in character and any State entitled to the most-favoured-nation treatment in Turkey could claim them in equal degree.   These considerations should be placed before King Feisal, and it should be made clear to him that we are precluded from complying with his request for international reasons.   In all the circumstances he would, in my opinion, be very ill-advised to refuse the treaty in the form offered by His Majesty&apos;s Government.. That the idea of a mandate may arouse prejudice among the less responsible elements-of the population I can understand, but I cannot believe that the permanent advantage-of placing the political rights of Iraq on the firm foundation of a guarantee of the League of Nations can be a matter of indifference to King Feisal and his advisers. I see nothing for it but to drop the treaty negotiations altogether if he adheres to his present position.   The regularization of the status of Iraq with all the disadvantages involved both to Iraq and ourselves would thus be indefinitely postponed.  AVe should
merely carry on under the authority of the draft mandate as at present. It that event no formal communication to the League of Nations about the mandate at the present stage would be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who would probably refrain pending further development of the local situation from pressing actively for its issue. King Feisal should clearly understand that his choice lies between these alternatives.It is of course possible to add a third to the above alternatives, viz., that we should drop both the treaty and the mandate and evacuate Iraq forthwith. That King Feisal would wish to bring matters to this point is to my mind scarcely credible; but should I prove wrong about this and should King Feisal show any disposition to favour our evacuation, a wholly new situation, which will have to be very carefully considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government, will have arisen. I do not entirely dismiss this contingency from my mind.I suggest that King Feisal should place the whole issue fairly before his Council of State and seek their advice before coming to a decision on a matter of such vital importance.In reply to &quot;this the High Commissioner telegraphed [No. 258] as follows on 31st, March:-I gave King Feisal and the Naqib a written precis of your telegram No. 182 on its receipt, and have since discussed with them, both individually and together, at great length the fundamental issue regarding the mandate. I have not yet succeeded in finding a solution.That both of them are completely staunch to the principle of exclusive relations and treaty with Great Britain is altogether beyond question ; and the hint that we might abandon Iraq and evacuate is regarded by them with dismay. They cannot, however, conceive it possible.The Naqib cannot visualize things from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government nor can he really appreciate their difficulty from the international point of view. He says that, if we wish it, he is quite prepared to retire from the scene, but for the sake of his good name now and with posterity he is not prepared to sign a treaty in which the parties are in the position of a mandatory and a mandated State  a position which he regards as incompatible with General Maude&apos;s proclamation that we came to Iraq in the role of liberators.The King has a better appreciation of the real difficulties of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but feels that if he accepted the above relationship iu a treaty his failure would be certain. He is convinced that the Constituent Assembly would repudiate both him and the treaty.. On the above I have to comment as follows : The origin of their objections is much more the sinister meaning attached to the hated word and theory of &quot; mandate &quot; than any fear that our control may prove too strict in practice; and that we should come to a rupture or a deadlock over a mere question of terminology, or that we should fail to find a formula, would be deplorable. I beg your assistance in the search. Is it not conceivable that in consultation between the Allies and the League of Nations the name and theory of &quot; mandate &quot; could be modified in the case of Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia alike ? So that in the last paragraph of the preamble of our treaty we might say something like this :-They have in exercise thereof become satisfied that, in the case of certain States, the designation and theory of a &quot;mandate &quot; and a &quot; mandated State &quot; as contemplated at the peace conference have now become inappropriate, and consider that the position of Great Britain towards Iraq may henceforth be regarded as that of holder of a trust from the League of Nations to induce the Iraq Government to establish, and develop the country on lines which, while ensuring the performance of Iraq&apos;s recognized obligations to Great Britain, shall be in the best interests of the people of Iraq and of civilization. It is further considered that these relations can for the future better be defined by a treaty of alliance than by any other means, and it, has been agreed as follows : The King and his Cabinet. The following telegram [No. 260] was sent to the Secretary of State by the High Commissioner on 1st April: King Feisal has for some time past been dissatisfied with the Cabinet owing to their disinclination to support his demands for an increase in the military budget at the expense of other Ministries and the incident of the akhwan raid coming on top of this has served indirectly to cause a Cabinet crisis.The King requested his Ministers to consider the means of defending the southern frontier, hoping that a rallying of the tribes would be suggested.   In the39-2 B
(jcourse of the debate on the 27th March, the Ministers asked whether the British Government was responsible for the external defence, and what cause of difference existed between the State and Nejd. The question of recourse to tribal (? contingents) was broached, but the meeting was unavoidably interrupted at this stage and no decision reached. This interrupted discussion on. tribal contingents was not mentioned, in the routine report of proceedings.On receiving the minutes next day the Xing took umbrage at the failure of the-Council to recommend any action, and at once summoned five Ministers, Naji Suwaidi, Banna Khaiyat, Abdul Latif Mandil, Izzat Pasha and Said (? Saiyid) Shahrestani, and requested them to resign, informing them that they had forfeited his confidence.This hasty action taken uii impulse without consulting me or anybody was most unfortunate especially in the case of Mandil, as Basrah opinion will be unfavourably affected by his enforced resignation. Quite unconnected with, this episode the Minister of the Interior had. two days previously tendered his long expected resignation.Thus the only two members of the Cabinet, besides the Naqib, who retain the King&apos;s confidence are Sassoon and Jafar. While greatly deploring his hasty action, I advised the King on hearing what had happened that it would seem more in order under the circumstances that Naqib should offer the resignation of the Cabinet as a whole and be at once invited to form a new one. The latter, however, preferred asking for the resignation of the five Ministers in question ; and unfortunately this course was followed by the resignation of Sassoon, which, however, has not been accepted.As regards successors, Taufiq, governor of Baghdad, had previously been offered the Interior-this is a good selection. For Works, they contemplate Sabih, an able and apparently moderate man, recently returned from the (-? Far East); King Feisal, however, has (? invited) the Naqib to make the selection. (? Sassoon) will persist in his resignation if the King and the defence committee insist on more than 90 lakhs being assigned to the military budget.He maintains that if a larger sum is provided, the other blanches of the Administration will be crippled to an unreasonable extent,THE DOMINIONS.Position of British Indians in the Empire [B.E.R., lxii, p. 5]. The following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand on 5th April with reference to his telegram of 19th January : It is now proposed that an official visit should be paid during the coining summer to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand by Mr. Sastri, who will not be accompanied by any colleagues, but will take with him as secretary Mr. G. S. Bajpai, of the Indian civil service, and one servant. It is proposed that he should leave India about the middle of May, spend three or four weeks in Australia, and perhaps a fortnight iu New Zealand; arrive at Vancouver about the middle of August, and spend about six weeks in Canada. As regards any tours undertaken, he wall naturally be in the hands of your Ministers. The exact itinerary cannot yet be suggested, but the Government of India will communicate direct with your Government on the subject. The Secretary of State for India asks that the Government of India may also be informed, direct, as to the name of the officer who will be concerned with the detailed arrangements, so that, if there is no objection, Mr. Bajpai may get into personal touch with him.AUSTRALIA.Meat. The following message from the Prime Minister was sent through the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 29th March : Owing partly to large stocks at Vesteys, London, but more particularly to the dumping of Argentine beef iu Britain, the cattle industry of Australia is in a most serious and indeed a desperate condition. Practically all the great freezing works are closed, and the cattle men are killing calves by thousands. Cattle men have lost hope since beef is so far below the cost of production. Millions of acres in Queensland and other States will be thrown out of use if this great primary industry is ruined ; and this will involve huge financial losses and strike an almost fatal blow at developing subtropical and tropical Australia, nearly all of which is suitable for cattle, raising. Please note the fact that Australia can produce cattle more cheaply than any country in the world, including the Argentine aud the United States, that what is
going on now is nothing less than a deliberate attempt to oust Australia from the British and the world markets by great interests hostile to Australia aud the Empire., I cannot set out the position fully by telegraph, but what I say will be amply -corroborated by careful enquiry. The Commonwealth cannot, and the Empire ought not to allow the great primary Australian industry to be destroyed. The Common-wealth, is prepared to do its share and hopes that Britain will help. The Common-wealth is prepared to subsidize the Australian meat industry by a halfpenny per pound if the British Government do so too. This will give Australian beef a chance to fight for a share of: the British market, by helping to overcome the freight handicap.On 7th April the Governor-General transmitted a further telegram from Mr. Hughes reporting that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia had fully considered the position and, in view of the deplorable condition of the meat industry, had undertaken to meet the position in the following manner : Ali sections of the industry to co-operate in the measures necessary to meet the situation. Workers to accept a reduction of wage equivalent to a decrease in the cost of living, thus leaving the standard of living unaffected. Meat w^orks to reduce charges for treatment, the reduction to be equal to one-eighth of a penny per pound over and above the lessened cost of treatment due to the reduction of wages. Alternatively, treatment works to give an. extra price to the grower equivalent to such reduction of wage and treatment. Only standard meat properly prepared to be exported. Commonwealth inspectors to lie supported by the industry in carrying this into effect A meat board composed of representatives of the industry to be appointed to safeguard its interests, to arrange for supervision, and, as far as possible, for control. Statutory powers to be given to the board by a State law. Competent representatives of the industry selected by the growers to be sent forthwith to Britain to safeguard its interests and develop trade, and similarly to the East. An -effective propaganda to be carried on to popularize Australian meat and combat the influence of rival suppliers. A reduction of beef freights of one farthing per lb. Subject to the above conditions being accepted, the Government of the Commonwealth -of Australia will (1) endeavour to clear the old stocks of Australian meat in London, (2).give a subsidy of one farthing per lb. on all this season&apos;s beef stored in cool chambers before 31st October and shipped not later than 31st December 1922, (3) review the basis of income tax valuations per head for calves.Note that these conditions apply particularly to Queensland. Where they or any of them are inapplicable to other States the matter can be adjusted by separate negotiations.1 desire to emphasize that the steps we have taken to rectify the position mean a sacrifice in every direction all sections make some sacrifice for the common good. We hope that the effect of this will stabilize the Empire&apos;s meat industry, and that it will not increase the price to the British consumer, but will protect him from -exploitation on the one hand and from inferior meat on the other hand. However, if the avenues of distribution in Britain are controlled by foreign trusts we cannot do much permanent good, and the Commonwealth Government therefore most strongly urges the British Government to bring the recommendation of the Bridgeman Report (191VI) into operation without delay, particularly the recommendations contained in paras. 63 -and 64, which require all meat importers and dealers to hold licences and to furnish periodical returns concerning their operations, and which further provide for the establishment of a meat department under the Board of Trade. I most strongly urge you to co-operate with us to save from disaster this great imperial industry.Trade. According to a communique issued from the office of the High Com-missioner in London on 28fh March, the value of the goods imported during the month of February was 9,352,4551., and that of the exports 12,986,857/.., of which -all but 351,8781. was Australian produce.SOUTH AFRICA.Women and Children^ Convention [B.E.R., lxii, p. 5]. On 6th April the Governor-General sent the following reply to the circular telegram sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 2.1st January : My Ministers are in complete sympathy wdth its aims and objects, and are prepared to use all means under the existing laws or by administrative instructions to give effect to the convention, but are not at present in a position to introduce legislation to amend laws to cover points in which they may be defective.   The
existing laws make sufficient provision for carrying out the terms of the convention with the following exceptions, which appear of no great moment.(1) Article 3. While under the South African system of law mere preparation for the commission of an offence is not punishable because it does not constitute what is technically an attempt to commit an offence, nevertheless where a specific attempt to commit an offence is accompanied by an act directed towards the execution of the intent, then if that act is part of a series of acts necessary or thought by the accused to be necessary to the commission of the offence, it is punishable as an attempt. This seems to go very far towards fulfilling the terms of the convention.(2) Article 6. The existing law in the two most populous provinces provides for such licensing and supervision. There appears to be no practical need for extending those laws at present to the other two provinces. Further, inasmuch as under existing circumstances women and children clo not leave the shores of South Africa for such employment in another country, there is apparently no necessity for specific regu-lations for ensuring protection after they have left the Union.(3) Article 7. Social conditions in the Union render undesirable the exhibition of notices in the railway stations and ports warning women and children. Subject to reservation on the points indicated, my Ministers are prepared to recommend that the Convention be ratified on behalf of the Union.The following paragraphs were telegraphed by Reuter&apos;s agents :  Mining Industry Board. General Smuts, the Premier, to-day announced in the House of Assembly the appointment in accordance with previous promises, of a commission to be known as the Mining Industry Hoard for the purpose of investigating matters in relation to the recent strikes. The board will comprise&apos; Justice Sir William Solomon, chairman, Mr. William Brace, labour adviser to the-British Department of Mines, Sir Robert Kotze, Government mining engineer, and Sir Carruthers Beattie, principal of the University of Capetown. General Smuts expressed gratification at obtaining the services of Mr. Brace, whose wide experience of British labour problems would, he said, add very considerably to the commission s usefulness. The commission would start work as soon as possible. The terms of reference are to include : (1) The effect and extent of the status quo agreement of 1918 on the gold mines of the Witwatersrand and the necessity of its continuance, variation, or abolition wholly or partly.(2) Tlie desirability or otherwise of establishing any system for regulating the-ratio of European to native laborer in the gold and coal mines of the Transvaal.(3) Methods of effecting economies to promote efficiency and to secure the maximum field for the employment of Europeau labour.(4) With a view to the working of the largest number of gold mines the possibility of classifying mines into two or more grades employing different ratios of European to native labour, or practising different systems of wages and overhead charges, and the establishment of machinery for effecting and controlling such a classification.(5) The recent disputes in the coal mining industry and between the Victoria Falls Bower Company and its employees.  [Capetown, 28th March,]Immigration. It is officially notified that an increasing number of immigrants arriving in Union ports are unable to read or write any European language and are consequently prohibited emigrants. The provisions of the Immigration Act will be strictly enforced in future. Friends and relatives of intending immigrants are advised to notify such persons of the requirements of the Act and to discourage those who are unable to meet the requirements from proceeding to the Union. [Pretoria, 29th March.]Mozambique Convention Denounced. -In the Legislative Assembly to-day General Smuts stated that some time ago the Portuguese Government had informed the Union that they were dissatisfied with the Mozambique convention which they regarded as-no longer applicable in the present circumstances. Without actually denouncing the convention they had proposed that a conference should be held, but it did not materialize. Therefore the Union Government, which was equally dissatisfied, gave notice of the denunciation of the convention which would operate from 1st April 1923. The Union Government, however, had renewed their invitation to the Portuguese delegates with whom they would shortly confer in Capetown with a view to framing a new convention.   [Capetown, (3th April.]
