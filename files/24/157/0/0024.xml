GREAT BRITAIN.The Unemployment Situation. The following paragraph is taken from the special weekly report on unemployment for the week ending 17th February, issued by the Ministry of Labour :-There is still no indication of a general revival in industry. Employment in -coal-mining is slightly better, more regular time being worked in some areas. The slight improvement in the iron and steel industry has been maintained. In ship-building and marine engineering there are no developments, trade being practically at a standstill, though there is a fair amount of activity in ship-repairing. There is still no change in the cotton industry, though the woollen industry continues to show some improvement. Employment in the hosiery trade remains the same. General engineering is still very depressed, but the slight improvement in the motor and cycle section is extending. No change has taken place in the tinplate trade. The building trade shows no signs of improvement. The prospects appear to be rather brighter in the boot and shoe industry.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Communication to the Sultan by the High Commissioner. The following is the final draft of Lord Allenby&apos;s letter to the Sultan, together with the British Govern-ment&apos;s declaration to Egypt: Your Highness,1. I have the honour to bring to Your Highness&apos;s notice that certain passages of the explanatory note which I addressed to you. on 3rd December 1921 were inter-preted, to my great disappointment, in a manner not in accordance with the intention and policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. Judging by many comments which have been published on the subject of this note, it would appear that many Egyptians were under the impression that Great Britain was about to abandon her liberal and favourable attitude towards Egyptian aspirations, and to make use of her special position in Egypt in order to maintain a political and administrative regime incompatible with the freedom she had offered.3. Such an interpretation of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government was quite mistaken. On the contrary, the explanatory note emphasized the dominating-principle that the guarantees claimed by Great Britain are not designed to involve the continuance of an actual or virtual protectorate. Great Britain, as it is stated therein, sincerely desires to see &quot;an Egypt enjoying the national prerogatives and the international position of a sovereign State.&quot;4. If Egyptians haye regarded these guarantees as being out of keeping with the position of a free country, they have, on the other hand, lost sight of the fact that Great Britain has been obliged to claim them out of&apos; consideration for her own security, in face of a situation which demands great prudence on her part, particularly, in the matter of the disposition of her troops. Present world conditions, however, and the state of effervescence which has prevailed in Egypt since the armistice are not permanent factors and it is to be hoped that while, on the one hand the former will eventually improve, on the other hand the time will come when, in the language -of that note, Egypt s record will give confidence in her own guarantees.5. As to any desire to interfere in the internal administration of Egypt, His Majesty&apos;s Government have sufficiently stated, and repeat, that their most ardent desire is to place in Egyptian hands the conduct of their own affairs. The draft agreement proposed by Great Britain did not depart from this idea, and in making-provision for the presence of two British officials in the Ministries of Finance and Justice, it was not her intention to use these two officials for the purpose of.
intervening in Egyptian affairs, but solely in order to preserve the contact requisite for protecting foreign interests.   .....6. Such is the sole bearing of the guarantees that were deuiauded by Great Britain. They were claimed without any desire to impede Egyptians enjoying the full rights of a national Government.7. Animated as she is with these intentions, it, will. be understood that it is repugnant to Great Britain on the one hand to see the Egyptians delay by their own acts the realization of an ideal aimed at by both parties, and on the other to be compelled herself to intervene to re-establish order when it is threatened in such a way as to arouse the fears of foreigners and to involve the interests of foreign Powers, ft would be much to be regretted if Egyptians should see in the exceptional measures which have recently been taken any prejudice to the ideal to which they aspire or an intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to alter the policy I have indicated. In taking these measures, the sole desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been to put an end to a harmful agitation which by arousing popular passions might have such consequences as to jeopardize the whole result of the efforts of the Egyptian nation. These measures were taken primarily in the interest of the Egyptian cause, which has everything to gain by being studied in an atmosphere of calm and friendly discussion.S. Now that tranquillity seems to be re-establishing itself, thanks to the wise spirit which is the root of the Egyptian character and asserts itself in times of crisis, I am happy to be able to announce to Your Highness that His Majesty&apos;s Government are -prepared to recommend the accompanying Declaration for the approval of Parliament. This will, I am confident, establish a regime of mutual confidence and lay the foundation for a satisfactory and final bolution of the Egyptian problem.9. There is no obstacle to there-establishment forthwith of an Egyptian Ministry for Foreign Affairs which will prepare the way for the creation of the diplomatic and -consular representation of Egypt.        -10. The creation of a parliament with a right to control the policy and administration of a constitutionally responsible Government is a matter for Your Highness and the Egyptian people to determine. Should circumstances arise to delay the coming into force of the Act of Indemnity with application to all inhabitants -of Egypt mentioned in the declaration accompanying this note, I desire to inform Your Highness that I shall be prepared, pending the repeal of the proclamation of the 2nd November 1914, to suspend the application of martial law in respect of all matters affecting the free exercise of the political rights of Egyptians.11. It is now for Egypt to respond, and it is to be hoped she will justly appreciate the good intentions of Great Britain, and that reflection and not passion, will guide her attitude.The accompanying declaration is as follows :  Whereas His Majesty&apos;? Government, in accordance with their declared intentions, desire forthwith to recognize Egypt as an independent sovereign State;And whereas the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Egypt are of vital interest to the British Empire,The following principles are hereby declared : 1. The British protectorate over Egypt is terminated, and Egypt is declared to be an independent sovereign State.2. So soon as the Government of His Highness shall pass an Act of Indemnity with application to all inhabitants of Egypt, martial law as proclaimed on the 2nd of November 1914, shall be withdrawn.3. The following matters are absolutely reserved to the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government until such time as it may be possible, by free discussion and friendly accommodation on both sides, to conclude agreements in regard thereto between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Egypt: (a) The security of the communications of the British Empire in Egypt; (V) The defence of Egypt against all foreign aggression or interference, direct or, indirect;(c) The protection of foreign interests in egypt and the protection of minorities ;, id) The Sudan.Pending the conclusion of such agreements, the status quo in all these matters shall remain intact.

This has not yet been received.THE DOMINIONS.AUSTRALIA.Migration. Referring to his telegram of 24th November 1921 [B.E.R., lviii, p. 6 ], the Governor-General transmitted the following telegram from the Prime Minister, which was received on 1.3th February : I should be glad to know, with reference to my telegram of 24th November and your reply to the recent deputation, whether my proposal is favourably entertained by your Government. Arrangements have now been made with the Government of Western Australia which wall enable us to absorb 25,000 migrants as the minimum number, guaranteeing to every suitable male applicant, (1) 12 months&apos; work at stated wages, say 10*. a day, on the land, and (2) a living area of land on the expiry of that period, with assistance to purchase plant, &amp;c. The rainfall is good and the land fertile. We hope to make similar arrangements in other States. As arrange-ments for shipping migrants must be made immediately, it is essential that we should know at once whether the British Government is willing to co-operate.SOUTH AFRICA. The following telegrams were sent by EeuteFs agents :  Opening of Parliament. In his speech at the opening of Parliament to-day, the Governor-General referred to the Imperial Conference and the conclusion at the same time by the Union&apos;s representatives of an agreement with the Imperial Government for the handing over of the land defences of the Union.He trusted that the Washington agreement would remove for ever all possible causes of misunderstanding in the Far East, and he regarded the limitation of armaments negotiated at Washington as the most notable step towards ensuring international peace.His Royal Highness welcomed on behalf of the people of South Africa the establishment of the Irish Free State as a sister Domiuion in the British Common-wealth of Nations, trusting that it would prove a new source of strength to the Empire and enable the people of Ireland to work together in unity for its progress and happiness. Proceeding, the Governor-General announced that the Government had accepted Italy&apos;s invitation to the Genoa Conference, as the interests of the Union were closely bound up with a right solution of the economic problems of Europe.The relations of the Union with Rhodesia in connexion with Rhodesia&apos;s attain-ment of self-government would be discussed at a conference, while the Mozambique -Convention would form the subject of discussion at a conference to which the High
Commissioner of Mozambique bad been invited. The Governor-General dwelt upon tbe continued depression of trade and industry, which had led to unemployment and had adversely affected the public revenues. The Government had found it necessary to economize in the public and railway services and to continue earnestly to consider the serious problems arising from unemployment, &amp;c. The Government was con-sidering a programme of railway construction, also the reduction when possible of the railway rates in order to assist the development of the productive resources of the country.Referring to the Rand strike, which he said was seriously affecting the prosperity of the whole country, the Governor-General announced the intention of the Govern-ment to appoint an impartial board as outlined previously, the result of whose enquiries would be laid before Parliament.   [Capetown, 17th February.]Finance--In a statement on South Africa&apos;? financial position in the House of Assembly to-day, Mr. Burton, the Minister of Finance, said he anticipated a deficit at the end of: the financial year, 31st March, of 1,900,0001.He was of the opinion, however, that it would be wrong to levy additional taxes as he feared they were already taking out of the people&apos;s pocket money required for-developing the country.He pointed out that the maintenance of the gold premium had somewhat offset, the collapse in the diamond industry and he emphasized that the Government was exercising rigid economy.   [Capetown, 20th February.]The Rand Strike. The Chamber of Mines has issued a statement that no figures regarding the output of gold during January can be given ; but, in the event of the strike ending this month, any January returns will be included in those for February.The strikers are now only looking to Parliament for some sort of salvation and-the leaders of the Industrial Federation are counselling the men to maintain a peaceful attitude for 10 clays, which tactics they say would bear fruit. &apos; In view also of the opening of Parliament the Labour Executive are holding meetings on the Reef and sending speakers to meetings at tbe mines. The strikers are told to aim at remaining fast until the Smuts Government has been defeated. This was revealed hj a Dutch speaker at Boksburg, who hinted at nationalist assistance to the labour men on condition that the latter joined in a coalition for the overthrow of the Government.   [Johannesburg, 10th February.]
