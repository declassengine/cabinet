COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.   ;KENYA COLONY.The Currency. Router&apos;s agent telegraphed from Nairobi on 31st May : The new Kenya shilling was circulated to-day. This presumably ends the changes in the Kenya currency. During the past two years Kenya has had first the Indian rupee as the current standard coin divided into fractions of 100 cents, then the florin at the fixed rate of two shillings was introduced with 100 cents to the florin, and finally sterling was decided upon with pounds, shillings and cents, 100 cents being reckoned to the shilling.Owing to no shilling coins having been minted and the issue of shilling cents being delayed the country has also been run on a paper currency. The new shilling is slightly larger than the English coin.PALESTINE.Administrative Ueport. The administrative report for the month of April 1922 was submitted to the Secretary of State for the Colonies by the Acting High Commis-sioner on 4th May.The report states that the prospects of a good harvest have been seriously affected by the failure of &quot;latter rains.&quot; An average harvest may be expected in the central districts, but only a moderate yield of cereal crops in the north, while in the Beersheba district, failing an immediate rainfall there will be practically no harvest. The grain market continues stagnant with little or no change in values. The prospects for next seasoifs orange, olive and almond crops are excellent.With regard to the fishery service, the report states that statistics have been collected and placed at the disposal of two financial groups in England which are interested in the possible development of tbe fishing industry in Palestine.Under the heading of Commerce and Industry the report relates that the number of tourists that passed through Jerusalem in March was 2,873. Retail traders have not benefited to the extent anticipated, as the tourists did not appear to have at their disposal the time to devote to shopping expeditions. Successful representations have been made to tourist agencies to remedy this situation.GREAT BRITAIN.The Unemployment Situation. The following summary of the situation is taken from the special report on unemployment for the week ending 26th May, issued by the Ministry of Labour : The dispute in the engineering industry continues to affect workpeople not only in that industry, but also in allied industries, especially in the shipbuilding trades. From all parts of the country it is reported that ship-repairing work continues to improve, but constructional work is practically at a standstill. From the Midlands and north-eastern divisions some improvement is reported in the iron and steel industries, but this tendency is scarcely likely to he continued unless an early settle-ment of the dispute in the engineering industry is effected. In Scotland and Wales the position remains practically the same. In the south-western and Scottish coal-fields there is no appreciable change in the situation ; in the latter, however, work is being retarded by the dispute in the engineering industry. In the Lancashire pits the outlook is unfavourable owing to the shortage of orders and the recent reduction in wages. In Wales some improvement has been recorded at certain towns, notably Aberdare and Amman ford.There has been a marked improvement in the cotton industry, clue apparently to a revival in the Indian markets, which has kept exporters busy. The seasonal improvement previously recorded in the clothing trade continues. A general improvement in the glove trade is also reported. The improvement in the hosiery and woollen and worsted trades has been maintained in. the north-eastern division, but in Scotland the anticipated improvement has not materialized. In the building trades, seasonal decorative and repair work continues to flourish, but there appears to be little demand for builders&apos; materials and for constructional work. Li the boot and shoe trade, employment has improved in the Midlands division, but the severe depression continues at Bristol and Kingswood. In the south-eastern division, there are signs of revival in the printing trade, but depression exists at Bristol. The position in the jute industry has considerably improved at Dundee and Arbroath, and in the fishing - industry in Scotland intermittent employment is now available. Although the depression in the pottery trade continues, there are signs of improvement in some towns in the Staffordshire district.
Large quantities of cereals have been exported to Syria. The general increase-in world prices is now affecting Palestine, which is thus enabled to compete again in the cereal market..The development of commerce and industry is indicated by the following extract from the report: &quot;Of interest is the formation of the Levant Bonded Warehouses Company,&apos; Limited, registered on April 7th with a capital of  E.20,000, divided into 20,000 shares of  E.1 each, 10,000 of which are reserved for the Palestinian public. This company, the first of its magnitude to go to the Palestine public on a general sub-scription, proposes to erect sheds of 1,800 square metres superficial area at Haifa and Jaffa and later in Jerusalem also.&quot;Statistics dealing with immigration and travel show that &quot; 3,157 travellers entered Palestine during March; 1,817 left, including 39 discharged Egyptian labourers, 125 emigrants (jews 43, Christians 56, moslems 26), and 102 newly arrived immigrants (jews 72, Christians 3, moslems 27); 736 immigrants entered, of whom 712 were jews, and of these 372 came from Poland and 102 from Rumania.&quot;The following extract gives the labour position:-&quot; The employment situation shows an improvement. Apart from immigrants recently arrived, there are about 1,250 unemployed men in the country, of whom 750 are Jews and 500 Arabs. Of the latter two-thirds belong to Bethlehem, where much unemployment has resulted from the critical state of the religious souvenir industry. It is anticipated that the other unemployed will find work within the near future. On the other hand there is scarcity of carpenters, cabinet makers, locksmiths, plumbers, &amp;c, of whom there is not an adequate supply within the country.&quot;A Union of Motor Drivers and Mechanics has recently been formed with a membership of about 370, from among Arabs and Jews. The governing committee consists of four moslems, four christians, and four jews.&quot;In reporting on legal events the following statement is included :-&quot;At the meeting of the Advisory Council held in April, ordinances were approved providing for the organization and discipline of the British section of the gendarmerie, for the taxation and regulation of the sale of liquor and of places of public entertainment, for the amendment of the Companies ordinance in the section dealing with insurance companies, and for fixing the fees payable by land owners for a cadastral survey. It was agreed that the ordinance passed last year restricting the increase of rents and protecting tenants from eviction should be maintained in force for a further period in any place where the Governor thinks it necessary. The ordinance for the regulation of the profession of advocates was referred to a -committee of the Council.&apos;&apos; The demarcation of the lands of&apos; the state domains in the Jordan valley is steadily proceeding, but owing to the peculiar customs of tenure continual legal difficulties arise.&quot;The following extracts from the report appear under the heading of Public Health :-&quot; Owing to the withdrawal of army hospitals from Kantara at an early date arrangements have been made to take over the sisters&apos; quarters of the stationary hospital upon their evacuation and to equip them as a small hospital for the treatment of railway and other government employees stationed at Kantara. The hospital will be controlled by tire railway quarantine medical officer at Kantara and used for the isolation of sick passengers.&quot; Her Royal Highness Princess Alary has graciously consented to the unexpended balance of the money subscribed in Palestine for the wedding gift being applied to the equipment of a special maternity&apos;.ward of 12 beds in the government hospital in Jerusalem, to be named &apos;The Princess Mary Ward.&apos; &quot;INDIA.The Fortnightly Report. The following telegram was sent on 31st May :  Madras. The lull in political activity continues. Opinions of congress adherents are divided as to the desirability of revising the congress programme. From two districts there are further indications of a campaign on the part of non-co-operators to capture local government bodies. On the other hand, extremist papers issue a warning against attempts to participate in the reformed Councils, and urge a policy of obstruction by propaganda. Good progress has been made in Malabar with the disposal, of rebellion cases. There have been several i encounters with small 41-2 A 2
parties of Malabar rebels, two rebels being killed. The district magistrate affirms that, except in parts of Calicut Taluk, there is as yet no real distress. Mr. Ivhapp is about to visit Malabar, and will decide, in consultation with local officers, any measures that may be necessary.Bombay. Political agitation is quiescent throughout the presidency, except in Larkana, where objectionable speeches have been delivered. The Commissioner in Sincl is instituting proceedings against the most prominent offenders under section 108. At a liberal conference, held early in May, a motion for a proposal to request the-Government of Bombay to give Gandhi special concessions in jail was lost by 35 votes to 6 ; the conference aroused much public interest and widespread hostility in the extremist press.Bengal. Leaders of the non-co-operation and caliphate movements are engaged in holding meetings of the various district committees to discuss details of future action. Apart from a slight revival of picketing, no great activity has been displayed. There are signs that the Bardoli and Chittagong programmes will not rouse enthusiasm among the masses. The lull in activity is partly attributed to the fact that friction exists between the caliphate and congress committees and within the latter body. In some districts members of the old revolutionary party are coming into prominence. The Mymensingh committee, for example, has been captured by ultra-extremists. Tire situation has undergone no appreciable change. Generally, there is more discussion than active work, and more manifest indications of cleavage in the ranks of the non-co-operation party ; but the activities of the extreme group give cause for some apprehension, as some revolutionaries have been participating in dacoities, which points to severance from the principle of non-violence. So far, however, revolutionaries have made no great advance.United Provinces. The political barometer is fairly steady, though there is a partial exception at Allahabad, where Jevvahir Lai, who had been previously released on legal grounds, was re-arrested for active promotion of volunteers connected with picketing cloth shops in Allahabad ; Devadas Gandhi was also arrested and sentenced to 18 months&apos; imprisonment for a similar offence. Both were treated with patience, but are incorrigible. The sale of foreign cloth has revived owing to the wedding-season.   Non-co-operators are compelled to acquiesce.Punjab. The leaders, Malaviya, Tyabji, Patel, and Mrs. Naidu, after delivering very bitter speeches at a provincial conference at Batala at the end.of April, have visited centres of political importance and delivered lectures. Their efforts have not resulted in any marked revival-of agitation, though in some districts congress workers are reported to be more active. The political atmosphere generally remains calm. The investigating committee set up by Malaviya has so far done nothing to enquire, regarding government action against persons charged with, offences connected Avith political unrest in the province. Phe trials of agitators recently arrested are almost completed. Early in May a party of 150 akalis took possession of Naunar gurdwara in Sialkot, and the action to be taken is still under discussion. The akalis are elsewhere inactive, but are reported to be sullen, and it is possible that they may attempt a revival of agitation after the harvest. The visit of Malaviya, though a failure as regards hinclus and mohammedans, has had a bad influence on the sikhs, and it is now improbable that for the present, at any rate, they will accept any Gurdwara Bill. Miller, the railway agitator, was sentenced to four months&apos; imprison-ment on 6th May.Bihar and Orissa. The political situation remains generally quiet. The number of meetings has decreased, and there is little picketing. The local leaders are chiefly concerned with pushing the sale of khadclar. Arrangements for an All-India congress session at Gafa largely occupy their attention. In Orissa, the position has greatly improved. Bhagalpur division is generally quiet. In Chota Nagpur normal con-clitions generally obtain. In Patna the position is quiet and satisfactory. In Tirhut the Commissioner reports that the lull in non-co-operation is so profound that people are asking Avhat it means.Central Provinces. The report of the sub-committee appointed by the Central Provinces congress committee to suggest modifications in the non-co-operation programme has been published for public discussion. The main modifications suggested are: (1) The abandonment of the boycott of government courts by litigants and laAvyers ; (2) the abandonment of the boycott of defence in government courts ; (3) the abandonment of the boycott- of the councils; and lastly, (4) a declaration that mass civil disobedience - is an impossibility. This programme is fiercely opposed by the more fanatical section of the non-co-operation party. Picketing of liquor shops continues in a few centres.
Assam. There has been no change since the last report. From the Surma valley the disbandment of the national volunteer corps is reported. From Sylhet it is reported that interest is again, being taken in the election of chaukidari panchayats. &apos;(i.e,, the local bodies which assess and collect the village police rate), and that indicates that Europeans and government servants are regarded with less hatred than has been the case for a long time. In the Assam valley the position is quiet. There .are reports, however, from more than one district officer of the persistence of an undercurrent of bad feeling.North-West Frontier Province. The Frontier Inquiry Committee is now sitting, -and very great interest, to the exclusion, of other topics, is being taken in the towns of the province in this matter. The agitation in favour of re-amalgamation with the Punjab has been organized mainly by hindus. A number of meetings to discuss the subject have been held throughout the province during the past fortnight, and the atmosphere of the province has been disturbed. Chime is light, and there is a marked-fall in the prices of foodstuffs.General. At the latest meeting of the working committee of the All-India -congress committee, there were resolutions, inter alia, that a committee be appointed to organize and advance national education ; that certain sums should be earmarked for work amongst the depressed classes; that a khaddar scheme should be sanctioned, with a large grant for maintaining it; further, it was decided to alter the constitution of the Indian national congress ; that the central office should be located at Bombay, and that various departments should be placed in charge of members of the working committee, the departments being:-(I)-khaddar; (2) enrolment of members and volunteers ; (3) drink and untouchability; (4) national education; (5) panchayats; (6) propaganda; (7) finance; (8) unity among the various departments. The -committee accepted a request for affiliation received from Indians at Kabul, but rejected their offer to raise funds, which would doubtless have consisted of Bolshevik money.   Generally the lull still continues, and is likely to last till the harvest is over.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Sun Life Assurance Company. ReuteFs agent, telegraphing from Capetown on 18th May, reported that&apos; the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada had concluded -arrangements with the New York Life Assurance Company and the Equitable Life Assurance of the United States whereby the first-named company took over the present policies of the other two in. South Africa, guaranteeing the policy-holders their existing rights.AUSTRALIA.Russian Famine Relief. On 25th May the following communique was issued from the office of the High Commissioner in London : In January last the Government of Australia made a gift of 50,000Z. worth of Australian meat for relief of the famine in Russia. The directorate of the Russian Famine Relief Organization has now informed the High Commissioner for Australia (Sir Joseph Cook) that the entire consignment of this meat, consisting of 106 waggon-loads, safely reached the relief centres, with the exception, of four waggon-loads which, somewhere en route, became detached and have not been traced. The meat was forwarded from Riga. It was distributed (31 waggon-loads) at Saratov by the Save the Children Fund officials, aud at Buzuluk (71 waggon-loads) by those of the Society of Friends. Both places report that it arrived in perfect condition and was very greatly appreciated by the famine-stricken peasants to whom it was given.Trade.-According to information emanating from the office of the High Commissioner the imports for the month of April were of the value of 10,283,234L, the -exports 10,905,5322., of which all but 224,5922, was Australian produce.SOUTH AFRICA.Ratification of Treaties [B.E.R., lxix,&apos; p. 6].-The Governor-General telegraphed -to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 1st June in the following terms : Referring to your telegram of Pith May regarding the ratification of the treaties -signed at Washington, my Ministers intend bringing the treaties before the Union Parliament. A motion in favour of ratification is on the order paper of the House of Assembly for 2nd June.. I will telegraph you the result. It cannot yet be laid before the Senate, which has adjourned till loth June.
The following paragraphs were telegraphed by Renters agents :  Currency Question. The report of the conference which was held in Pretoria, last September to advise the Government on currency questions was made public to-day. It recommends that every endeavour should be made to revert as speedily as possible to the pre-war gold standard, under which all notes were convertible on demand into gold which could be freely exported.. It also recommends that the South African Reserve Bank be authorized to take steps to prevent further inflation of currency, and that a policy of returning to specie payments on a gold basis at the-earliest possible moment be steadfastly pursued. It further opposes any permanent debasement of currency in South Africa and advocates the removal of the embargo on the export of gold bullion as soon as possible.   [Capetown, 18th May.]Industrial Policy. Speaking in the Union House of Assembly during the course of the debate on the Budget, General Smuts made an important and comprehensive-statement on the Governments industrial policy. He foreshadowed a new lease of life for the gold mining industry, and pointed out that efforts were being made to-secure an outlet for South African coal on the Indian Ocean. Tbe gold industry, the Premier said, should be working normally by September, thus absorbing most of the unemployed, but provision must still be made for the semi skilled and unskilled workers. The Government hoped by means of. railway construction, irrigation and afforestation schemes to absorb all of them, and the removal of these men from the Rand was already proceeding steadily.Dealing with industrial policy, General Smuts said :-&quot; We are all industrialists. The problem now facing the country was how to bridge the transition from the old to the new South Africa and how to develop in the industrial sphere.&quot;A difficulty arose. High protection meant high wages, which would injure mining and agriculture. Hence they needed to move forward sanely and moderately in shaping an industrial policy. They needed greater economic independence. General Smuts instanced the detrimental effect of the high tariffs of Australia, where, he said, the industries were falling to pieces. In the case of boots and shoes, the Govern-ment had adopted the alternative method of the per nut system, the advantage of which was that the consumer had benefited in the fall of the world prices. Dealing with the dumping clanger, General Smuts declared that customs tariff, both, from the revenue and the protective view point, needed thorough revision. The Board of Trade was conducting a careful investigation into the matter with a view to legislation in 1923.Referring to methods of encouraging local industries, General Smuts announced that preference would be given to South Africans in connexion with the electrification of the railway, and he said it was proposed to institute a bounty system with the-object of building up the iron and steel industry.Owing to severe droughts and a plague of locusts the farmers must be assisted. One of the gravest questions exercising the Government was the meat industry, which was in a state of chaos and internal disorganization from which farmers and consumers alike were suffering. Moreover they had spoiled an opportunity of building up an export trade owing to the exportation of inferior quality. Hence the necessity for organization and a system for the regulation of exports which would render null and void the effect of &quot;any monopoly. Referring to the reported agreement between the Meat Producers&apos; Exchange and the Imperial Cold Storage Company, neither he nor the Government knew anything about it, but the question was more serious than that, and he appealed to all parties to combine to solve this great problem. He concluded by emphasizing the necessity of maintaining and developing mining and agriculture in nroportion to other industrial development which would take place. [Capetown,. 22nd May,]The Union and BJiodesia [B.E.R., lxx, p. 6j. In the House of Assembly General Smuts made a statement on the negotiations regarding the entry of Rhodesia into the Union. He pointed out that agreement wdth the Chartered Company was essential before the Government could offer terms to Rhodesia. The negotiations with the Chartered Company had been protracted and very difficult, but an even greater difficulty was that the consent of the Imperial Government was necessary iu connexion with the agreement. General Smuts strongly emphasized the fact that the Union Government was not responsible for the delay and declared it was inevitable. The Union Government had laboured night and clay to overcome the difficulties, and it was quite wrong to say that the delay was its fault. In conclusion the Premier predicted that at nq distant date, and. long before the Rhodesian referendum was possible, all the difficulties would be cleared away.   [Capetown, 22nd May.]
