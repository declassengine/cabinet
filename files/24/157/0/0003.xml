GREAT BRITAIN.The first two of the following paragraphs are taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 26th April, and the third from the Report for the week ending 3rd May : Sympathetic Action by Trade Unions in Support of the Miners. The most important development in the situation during the past week has been the action of the executive councils of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen in issuing instructions to their members not to handle coal at colliery sidings, or coal imported as a consequence of the dispute. Transport workers employed on coaling and bunkering in the various ports have been instructed to refuse to bunker any ship taking less than her normal quantity of bunker coal in order to reach continental, American or colonial coaling ports.The only action of the joint committee of the parliamentary Labour party, the national executive of the Labour party, and the parliamentary committee of the trades union congress, has been to issue, on the 23rd April, an appeal to all sections of the Labour movement and to all affiliated bodies to give assistance to the &quot; Save the -Miners&apos; Children Fund,&quot; which was instituted last week under the auspices of the Da,ily Herald.The co-operative societies in the various mining districts are working in con-junction with the county associations in order to relieve pressure on the miners&apos; funds. The Coalville society have decided to acknowledge trading vouchers issued by the Leicestershire Miners&apos; Association to the amount of 13,500L during the next three weeks, should the duration of the dispute render this necessary, and this loan is.to be repaid free of interest by the association when the dispute has terminated. A similar policy has also been adopted by co-operative societies in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire.A new feature of the situation is the granting of sums of money, either as loans or gifts, -by various trade unions. The Amalgamated Engineering Union have lent 50,000 . to the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, who appear already to be in financial difficulties, as they have appealed to the Barnsley Co-operative Society for the loan of 100,0001. The Asylum Workers&apos; Union have offered to lend 3,000Z. to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. At the meeting of the executive council of the National Union of General Workers it was decided that the members should be asked to pay a levy equal to a total payment of 3s. per member, during the present quarter, to enable the union to make a grant of 1,0001. a week to the miners. Financial assistance is also being given by the Licensed Vehicle Workers&apos; Benevolent Society and the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives.A curious attitude has been adopted by the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers towards the action of the triple alliance in cancelling the proposed strike. At a meeting of the executive committee a resolution was passed &quot; regretting the apparent breakdown of the triple alliance machinery as evidenced in connexion with the miners&apos; dispute,&quot; and declaring that &quot; the workers concerned should appoint a grand jury to inquire into its causes, in order that the working-class movement may profit thereby, and reconstruct its machinery in such a way that it will be impossible to fail in its function for working-class deliverance from the bondage of capitalism.&quot;International Transport Workers&apos; Federation. The congress of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation was. held at Geneva from the 18th April to the 22nd April. The British transport workers were represented by Messrs. Ernest Bevin, Ben Smith, Cotter and Maynard ; and Mr. Tom Shaw, of the General Union of Textile Workers, was also present. A resolution was passed at the first session, declaring that the most effective weapon against militarism was the organised strength of the trade union movement, and it was decided that a certain sum of money should be set aside for purposes of propaganda against militarism. At the second session, resolutions were adopted demanding universal free trade, and the removal of all protective tariffs, embargoes and controls on the exchange of commodities between countries. Two commissions were appointed, the first to consider measures for bringing about the&apos; socialization of the means of transport, and the second to report on the admission of unions representing post office, telegraph and telephone workers to the federation.
At the last session a resolution was unanimously carried, &quot; calling upon European and American transport and railway workers to refuse all labour service for the transport, shipment or handling of coal likely to be sent to Great Britain during the present lock-out of mine-workers.&quot; The secretary to the federation stated that notices had been sent out to the transport workers in various countries to cease shipping coal to London, and the Dutch and German workers had. promised to support the federation.General Survey of the Week ending 3rd May. The most important event of the week has been the suspension of negotiations in the coal dispute, consequent upon the rejection by the miners&apos; national delegate conference, on the 28th April, of the Governments offer of a grant of 10,000,000?. to mitigate the hardships involved in the proposed reductions in miners&apos; wages. This rejection has been followed during the week-end by meetings of the miners and of the councils of the local associations in various districts, which have expressed approval of the action of the national delegate conference ; and there appears to be no likelihood of an early resumption of negotiations. Public discussion of the principles involved in the dispute, however, continues, and a further letter from Sir, W. PI. Beveridge appeared in The Times of the 3rd May, in which he suggested, inter alia, the appointment by the Government of a commission of three or five independent persons to make proposals for the permanent management of the coal industry, the Government undertaking to carry -out the recommendations of such a commission, reserving only the right of suspending action on political issues of supreme importance until after a general election, and the miners&apos; undertaking to resume work on the appointment of the commission. Mean-while unemployment continues rapidly to increase, almost every industry being now affected. The consequent falling-off in goods traffic has led to the suspension on the railways of the &quot;guaranteed week&apos;&apos;; similar action on some of the local tramway undertakings is also reported. The position as regards sympathetic action which, up to the present, has been distinguished by its mildness has not materially changed since last week, although an unofficial agitation is being carried on in various parts of the country, especially amongst railwaymen and transport workers&apos;, with a view to securing the adoption of a more militant policy. In view of the expiry of the Proclamation of Emergency issued on the 31st March, a further proclamation was issued on the 30th April; and the emergency regulations which expired on the latter date have also been renewed.Important negotiations, concerning proposed reductions of wages, -which have been somewhat overshadowed by the coal dispute, are in progress in the building and engineering trades. In connexion with the latter, a decision of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, the National Union of Foundry Workers and the National Federation of General Workers, to negotiate in future with the engineering employers jointly and as one body, is of some importance. These unions are offering strong opposition to the engineering-employers&apos;proposals, although a recent. ballot of the members of the shipbuilding-unions on the reduction proposals of the shipbuilding employers has resulted in a majority in favour of acceptance. It may be observed, however, that the reductions at present proposed by the engineering employers are much heavier than those accepted by the shipbuilding unions. Important negotiations are also pending in the cotton industry, where the present wages agreements are about to expire, and it is reported that in this industry also substantial reductions in wages will be proposed by the employers.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.RHODESIA.The Buxton. Committee. On 25th April .the Secretary of State for the Colonies instructed the High Commissioner of South Africa to communicate the Buxton committeo&apos;s report to the elected members for their consideration ; and to inform them that he, Mr. Churchill, would await their reply before taking further action.[The Buxton committee was appointed by the Secretary of State to consider ,certain questions connected with Southern and Northern Rhodesia. The report has been laid before Parliament (Cmd. 1273).]
. EGYPT.The General Situation. On 7th May Lord Allenby telegraphed [No.-307] the. following appreciation of the situation :--Zaghloul and his faithful adherents desire negotiations under the presidency and preponderating influence of Zaghloul, and after obtaining other conditions (such as. the previous abolition of martial law) set forth in ZaghlouPs Shubra speech and not: otherwise. This policy prevails amongst the students, probably amongst the religious bodies, a minority of officials, lawyers, Sc., and in many provincial towns, especially Tanta and Assiut, where it is actively propagated. Others desire negotiations under the auspices of Adly, but without the participation of the &quot;VVafcl, which would reserve its opinion until the negotiations are concluded. This Is the policy of the largest group of the Wafd, and finds its support largely amongst the lawyers.The policy of negotiating upon a twofold basis under the presidency of Adly and through a delegation, as representative as it may be possible to obtain, is widely supported by members of the old legislative assembly, the provincial councils, many of which have recently made definite declarations in his favour, and amongst the educated classes generally, as well as by the officials and landowners.There is a party which does not desire anything that can be called negotiation at all. They express themselves as willing to negotiate after the protectorate has been abolished and the Egyptian Sudan declared independent and evacuated by British troops: some would include in the Egyptian Sudan parts of Abyssinia and Somaliland. This is the policy of the Watanist party. Finally the Minister of Finance desires acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the reservations before negotiations are undertaken. This is the policy of one influential paper, the Akhbar, and has an appreciable body of adherents.Adly and Zaghloid-On 27th April Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 287] as follows : The negotiations between Adly Pasha and Zaghloul Pasha on the subject of the formation of the official delegation have reached a deadlock, and the breach between them now looks like being complete.The real point at issue has been the presidency of the delegation. In an interview published in the Ahram two days ago in reply to a statement by Zaghloul, Adly Pasha set forth his views as follows : He recalled that his Ministry had been formed in order to proceed with the official negotiations, and that both its&apos; formation and its public declaration of policy had been greeted with enthusiasm by the nation. Then Zaghloul Pasha had arrived and conversations centring upon new conditions, now published by Zaghloul, had ensued&apos;as to the terms on which the Egyptian delegation would participate in the official negotiations.The first term concerning (? the complete) abolition of the protectorate, and the second concerning (group undecypherable), the independence of Egypt internally and externally, Adly Pasha declared were implied or stated in different words in his own declaration of policy. He had told Zaghloul Pasha that he intended to elaborate these two points in a letter to the Sultan in which he would ask his Highness to designate the official delegation and that his letter would be printed in the official journal together with the answering sultanian decree. Zaghloul had demanded that the terms of their mission should be specified in the decree itself. Adly Pasha opposed this as unconstitutional on the ground that it shifted the responsibility from the shoulders of the Ministers to those of the Sultan.With regard to the abolition of the censorship and of martial law, the Ministry desired and were working&apos; towards this, but the establishment of calm and respect for liberty of opinion were essential preliminary conditions.As to the composition of the delegation, Adly Pasha stated that if they thought of attaining unity of view as regards the future of Egypt rather than of securing a majority for one section or another, they would soon arrive at an agreement concerning the personnel.On the question of the presidency, Adly Pasha said it would not be in accordance with the political traditions of any country that the chief of the Government should take part in negotiations in a subordinate capacity. While maintaining his own right to the presidency, he did not claim, as did Zaghloul, that the president, whoever he might be, should have the right to control the course of negotiations, and to continue them or break them off as he thought fit.   That right belonged to the delegation as
a whole. If Zaghloul demanded the presidency in order to have that right, there would be no reason why he should not go alone.The Government remained anxious that Zaghloul and his associates should share with it the work of the negotiations; but in any case it meant labour for the. realization of the country&apos;s aspirations.Zaghloul replied to this in a somewhat violent speech delivered at a reception to him at Shu bra on the afternoon of 25th April.He denounced Adly Pasha and traversed his arguments as regards press censorship and martial law. He asserted that it was purely from his patriotic motives, and in order that it (sic) may discharge the duty laid upon it (sic), that he demanded for himself and his followers the control of the negotiations. What was the truth with regard to Adly Pasha&apos;s claim that the Prime Minister must be the head of the official, delegation ? Who appointed the Egyptian Ministers ? Had not the High Commis-sioner a large share in it? Was not the Egyptian Minister a subordinate of the British Foreign Minister, and how could a subordinate negotiate on equal terms with his official superior ? It would be a case, as he had told Lord Milner, of &quot; King George V. negotiating with King George V.&quot;What hindered them from entrusting negotiations to the AVafd ? Was it the nation which shouted night and day (? that it) had a leader other than the Prime Minister? It was the entourage of the Ministry and certain journalists who were working for the exclusion of the Wafd.   He could never accept this.I understand that Adly Pasha is taking a firm attitude, and is now considering his plans. I am waiting to hear from him. in the course of the next day or two.&quot; A further report will be sent after I have seen him.Telegraphing [No. 287] again on &apos;30th April, Lord A11 en by reported that an open break had occurred in the Wafd. The vice-president, Ali Shaarawi, has written to Zaghloul resigning from the Wafd on the ground of its internal intrigue and its insincerity towards the country.   He had published his letter.Mohammed Mahmud, Hamad El Bassel, Abdul Latif El Mikabbabi, Ahmed Lutfi El Said and. Mohammed Ali had written and published a joint, letter to Zaghloul. They had expressed disapproval of his action in proclaiming his distrust of the Ministry on purely personal grounds against the advice of the majority of the Wafd and in insisting on the presidency of the official delegation. They repudiated; responsibility for the breach caused by this arbitrary and isolated (? action). They considered it their patriotic duty to announce their confidence in a Ministry which had conformed to the national will and agreed to the conditions of the Wafd as regarded the objects to be sought by the official negotiators. The Ministry could only hope for success in the negotiations if it had a secure position in the country. They advocated, the Wafd&apos;s abstention from the official negotiations while impressing upon the Ministry that they adhered to the reservations formulated by the Egyptian nation, without the attainment of which any agreement would be rejected by a national assembly.Abdul Khalek Madkur had publicly declared that he was opposed to any participation in the official negotiations except on a basis of complete independence. If the Wafd negotiated in virtue of a sultanic decree, this should be only after the abolition of the protectorate, otherwise the Egyptian representatives would be negotiating as vassals of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Ali Maher, Wissa Wasif and Hafez Afifi had, Lord Allenby understood, written to Zaghloul that they were in favour of participation in the official delegation (group undecyphefable) (? insist) on the presidency.Georges Khayat had not yet expressed himself, but was stated to agree with the members mentioned in para. 3.Abdul Aziz Fahmi had had nothing to do with the AVafd for some months.Zaghloul retained the support of Sinnot Banna, Wasif Ghali and Mustafa El Nahas in desiring to take part in the negotiations with the presidency and a majority.The above lines of divergence were also apparent in the press and among the educated classes. How far they might be reflected in popidar opinion remained to be seen.On 7th May Lord Allenby further reported [No. 306] that a declaration in the following sense had been published by the Prime Minister in the native press : The present Ministry on its appointment issued a programme which was consistent with national aspirations, and, as its aims were identical with those of 28-2 B
Zaghloul and his associates, it invited thein to co-operate with it in the negotiations... The country received the Governments programme with enthusiasm and openly gave-its support to the Government. On Saad Pasha&apos;s return to Egypt he made certain conditions which were discussed with him by the Cabinet, with the result that it was found that the only real difference between them was on one point, namely, the-presidency, which Saad Pasha insisted on having for himself. The position of the Cabinet in this matter is - that when final negotiations are undertaken by any Government the head of the Government must be the head &quot;of the negotiators. When the Government informed Saad Pasha that they could not accede to his request he-replied that the Egyptian Prime Minister was nothing but an official of the British Government, who held his position at the will of the High Commissioner, and that, therefore, no free discussion between such a chief and the British Minister for Foreign Affairs was possible. - Adly Pasha replied that he was not a British official, but the head of the Egyptian Government, which position he accepted in order to do his duty to his country, and that as he was the person who was claiming the abolition of the protectorate and the independence of his country he was obviously (? free) to defend the interests of his country before the British Minister for Foreign Affairs.Saad Pasha had declared that he would not co-operate with the Ministry in the negotiations even if all his conditions were accepted. He added that the people had. only supported the Ministry under compulsion and the Ministry had even ordered officials not to participate in any ceremony held in his honour. Adly Pasha denied that any compulsion had been brought to bear on the people and, as regards the-prevention of official ceremonies in honour of Saarl Pasha, stated that the attention of officials, who had formed a committee to hold meetings in honour of Saad Pasha, had been drawn to the fact that such action would not be in accordance with their duty towards the Ministry as a public body because Saad Pasha had openly declared his hostility to the Ministry. As to demonstrations, these had been allowed on the return of Saad Pasha in order to do him honour, but it was found that they continued indefinitely and became a menace to the public and had to be stopped in the interests of public order. As regards the incidents at Tanta, no one regretted them more than the Government. *Seeing then that Saad Pasha had adopted an attitude which made it impossible to arrive at any agreement with him, the Cabinet had determined to continue the work which it had undertaken, and the question had been, referred to his Highness the Sultan, who had given orders to the Prime Minister to form an official delegation under his presidency, and in accordance with this order the Cabinet would submit to his Highness the Sullan a report describing the mission of the negotiators and giving their names.The declaration ends with an appeal to the good sense of the nation to facilitate the task of the negotiators.The Disturbances at Tanta.  The following telegram [No. 294] was sent by Lord Allenby on 2nd May : According to the mudiPs report the disturbance originated in speeches made in the mosque after the midday prayers, in which speakers supporting Adly Pasha and Zaghloul respectively quarrelled. The chief of the mosque asked the police to intervene. The two parties continued their demonstrations in the streets, which the police tried to disperse. The rowdy elements got the upper hand, and stoned the police, who were ordered to fire in the air; one man, however, wounded two demonstrators, one of whom died in. the evening. This aroused great feeling against the commandant of police, and attacks were made on his house and the police station. The police were compelled to retreat. The police station was attacked with stones ; windows were broken and inflammables thrown in. The mudir arrived in a car with four notables to try and pacify the crowd. They were attacked and hit with stones and the mudir had to take refuge in the police station. The mob thereupon, burnt his car and the police fired again. The total casualty roll, known to date, is four killed and 60 wounded, of whom 24 by rifle fire and the remainder by stones. These include police and notables, the exact number of whom is not known. One hundred and fifty troops of the Egyptian army were sent at once, and the news of their arrival led to calm being restored that evening without their intervention.A,report just received states that the demonstrations continued on Saturday and Sunday. These demonstrations were not accompanied by any unfortunate incidents.. The mob are said to be practically en masse for Zaghloul, but certain students and
(group undecypherable) take the side of the Ministry. The incident is being, investigated by the native procureur-general in person; .,No British official has been concerned in any way.Telegraphing [No. 295] again on the same day, Lord Allenby said that Adly had informed him that the Tanta incidents had practically come to an end.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., xlii, p. 3].-Telegraphing [No. 242] on 28th April, the Viceroy reported that the activity of the enemy was continuing in Waziristan. A large party of Mahsuds had attacked our convoys on the 23rd April.near Piazha, inflicting the following casualties: British officers: killed, 1; wounded, 4/ Indian officers: wounded, 2. Indian other ranks: killed, 7; wounded, 26. Followers : killed, 3; wounded, 11.   350 camels were killed or missing.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xlii, p. 3]. Considerable telegraphic correspondence has taken place between the Secretary of State and the Viceroy, in which the policy to be adopted has been discussed. In a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs, transmitted [509 S.] by the Viceroy on 21st April, the former stated his view that the publication of the clause in the Russo-Afghan agreement as to the establishment of eastern consulates, and the demand on our side that they should not be established, would make it impossible for Russia to withdraw without admitting a severe diplomatic defeat. He adhered to his opinion that Afghanistan, if obliged to decide whether she would rely exclusively on Great Britain or Russia, would probably prefer the latter. That opinion was based on the assumption that there was little difference between the subsidies and other advantages that she might receive from either country. In view, however,-of Afghanistan&apos;s present need of money, Sir Henry believed that an immediate supply of an adequate sum, and the promise of arms in the event of Russian aggression, might possibly induce her to forgo her pretensions on the question of the tribes, and to break with Russia and the Turkish nationalists to an extent that would meet our requirements. The question of guarantee would arise, but it remained for the Government of India to consider whether it were more worth while to make an offer sufficiently large to outbid Russia, or to rupture the negotiations.Telegraphing on 27th April the Viceroy commented on the complication of the Afghan problem, and deemed it advisable to summarize the essential facts and factors-as follows : (1) The desire of Russia to effect a treaty with Afghanistan in order to secure her position with her moslems on the Afghan border and to be able to threaten us in India. (2) The anxiety of Afghanistan to make treaties with Russia and ourselves in order to improve her finances, and to get advantages from both without being dominated by either. (3) Our wish for a treaty with Afghanistan in order to obviate Russian domination and to preserve peace on the frontier. (4) The unsettled state of the frontier, due partly to the consequences of the Afghan war, partly to Afghan influence, and partly to Bolshevik intrigue. The Viceroy proceeded to indicate the three policies which are open to us as alternatives, namely, to offer Afghanistan money, arms, and assurances sufficient to outbid the Bolsheviks ; to make a final offer of our draft treaty to the Amir, with an assurance against aggression by a third Power, and with a demand for the disclosure of all treaties; to endeavour to make our treaty acceptable to the Amir by the modification of unessentials, while insisting on the exclusion of the eastern consulates and the disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty, and giving an assurance of support in the event of Russian aggression. Of these three policies the Viceroy reported that he and his Council were in favour of the third. ,The Viceroy&apos;s &quot;Weekly. Reports. The following telegram was received from the Viceroy on 1st May : Section 1. Bombay. Hartal on the 6th, though only partial in most places, was more general in the presidency than on previous occasions. That of the I3th was very half-hearted, and, on the wdiole, the non-co-operators were rather disappointed.   In Mofussil, work was mainly devoted to the temperance movement,
partly because of it being-an easy way to embarrass the Government and partly because it calls for no personal sacrifice. The picketing of liquor shops was well organized and orderly, but. in two districts a number of prosecutions have been instituted for trespass and embezzlement. There was some attempt at boycott in connexion with the temperance movement.Section 2. The secretaries of the congress and caliphate committees of Jacobabad applied to the police for permission for a procession in honour of a caliphate worker returning after one year&apos;s imprisonment. Permission was refused: the people, however, gathered at the station in large numbers Both secretaries were prosecuted under the Police Act for taking out a procession without permission. The accused are now in jail undergoing a sentence of five days&apos; imprisonment.Section 3. United, Provinces. Continued capital is being made of GandhPs reputation for sanctity by the revolutionary party. In the Gorakhpur division bands - of men have been moving about through the villages beating drums and declaring that GandhPs swaraj has already arrived. The movement, however, died, and there is some recrudescence of the anti-cow-killing agitation, further indicating the tendency of the present unrest to assume a religious turn. There are increasing indications of respect for law and order being weakened. The prosecution of ringleaders in the four districts of Oudh and the application of the Seditious Meetings Act had a salutary effect, but the leaders of the non-co-operation movement are bent on keeping the agitation alive by sending men round the villages and collecting money rather than by the&apos;fiery oratory hitherto adopted. Very violent speeches were made by the Alt brothers at the district caliphate conference, Shah-jahanpur. The question of their prosecution has been referred to the local Governments.Section 4. The Lucknow shiahs have decided to send a deputation to Mesopo-tamia, to satisfy themselves as to the truth of the recent rumours in regard to the holy places. Maulvi Hamid Ahmed has been committed to the sessions court for trial on a charge of sedition. At Cavvnpore, two non-co-operators have been arrested for refusing to furnish security.Section 5. The United Provinces Government issued instructions through the commissioners to all district officers that they should inaugurate an anti-revolutionary league in each district, the district officer being president, and a leading lawyer politician of moderate views, secretary.Section 6. Newspaper reports show that meetings called in some districts of Lucknow and Muttra, to inaugurate these leagues, met with organized opposition on the part of non-co-operationists.Section 7. Madras. The chief event of the month has been the visit of Gandhi and the Ali brothers. Gandhi confined himself chiefly to the social side (? of the work), the spinning wheel, the need for men and money, and the non-violent aspect of non-co-operation. The Ali brothers&apos; speeches were very violent, but reliable reports are difficult to obtain, as the speeches were delivered in Urdu and English, and the fact that languages were used not generally understood by Madras audiences detracts from the direct effect of the speeches on publication: Even so,&apos; a tremendous temporary enthusiasm was created and enormous crowds were attracted. Non-co-operation as a definite policy is probably not making much headway, but there is no doubt that anti-British and anti-Government sentiments are being preached extensively up and down the country, and that the preaching is having some effect.Section 8. There are again signs of trouble at the Buckingham mills. The dissension is rather between two sections of workers than between the workers and the management; namely, low caste men who have never been brought into the union and members of the union who belong to the higher castes, the former declining to accept the view that their interests are identical with those of the union. The Kerala provincial conference adopted a non-co-operation resolution, while the Malabar reforms conference condemned non-co-operation, and resolved to appoint a district propaganda committee to combat GandhPs movement.Section 9. A Charinva society has been organized in Calcutta to impart free instruction in spinning. Students from the National college will shortly start for propaganda work in villages under district congress committees. Meetings of mill hands in the district are becoming more frequent with the caliphate badges in evidence. Attendance at the reforms provincial conference, though, not large, was representative of the people and the various interests of the presidency, and gave indication of more
organized opposition on the part of the. moderates to the non-co-operation campaign. The national school movement meets with little success. Four hundred and forty-six of those who escaped from the Rajshahi jail have been recaptured.Section 10. Punjab. Lahore, Amritsar and Sheikhupura are proclaimed areas for a further period of six mouths, with effect from -26th April, under the Seditious Meetings Act; purely religious meetings and election meetings are exempt from the notification. Sardar Pratap Singh, the new editor of Akali, has been arrested under section 124a, Indian Penal Code. A press report shows that, in the Lahore municipal elections, caliphate and congress candidates have been returned by a majority of votes. The Burma anti-drink campaign has begun : picketing shops and houses is advocated.Section 11. General. In pursuance of the policy adopted in the Council of (? 27th March) already reported to you, we are addressing the local Governments on the importance of prosecuting persons (? guilty of) seditious speaking with the exception of Gandhi, advising the formation of battalions of armed police in order that the prompt despatch of detachments to (? storm, discreditable) centres may act as a deterrent to sudden outbreaks of violence. This is (? necessary) owing to the small number of troops employed on internal security and the fact that it is the duty of the police rather than of the military to deal with civil disturbances. We have emphasized the need of personal propaganda on the part of members of the Council, Ministers, commissioners, and district officers, in order to rally the moderates and make the most of the growing movement on the part of the moderates to come out into the open and defend their position. This more active policy may lead to\outbreaks of violence in places. We have reasons to hope that if mohamedan opinion could be met in the matter of Thrace, mohamedans would be detached from the caliphate movement and would then return to the side of the Government. The situation generally has certainly not improved since the last report, and Gandhia influence among the masses is increasing wdth a consequent loss in the regard for law and order and the authority of Government. In some provinces this is not without effect on the moral of our officers. We are at this moment considering the question of prosecuting Mohamed Ali and Shaukat Ali for violent speeches made in the United Provinces.You will have already gathered my views from my telegrams, and I have nothing to add save that there are indications that the non-co-operationists mean to use the municipalities where they have secured a majority for the purpose of maintaining their national schools. We must, however, wrait developments, as it is now announced that at Delhi the non-co-operationists will abstain from voting at municipal elections. No explanation is given, and I do not yet understand why this course is adopted.THE DOMINIONS.The Opium Convention. -On 2nd May the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and. South Africa, and to the Governor of Newfoundland, as follows :  The Netherlands Government have formally inquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Dominion Governments have any objection to the modification of the Opium Convention agreed to by the Assembly of the League of Nations on 15th December, whereby the League is to undertake the duties previously entrusted to the Netherlands (government as regards the collection of legislation and statistics. The note of the Netherlands Government states that in the absence of a reply by 1st June it will be assumed that there is no objection. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to reply that they have no objection to the proposed modification, and unless an intimation to the contrary is received by 15th May will assume that your Ministers concur.AUSTRALIA.New Guinea. According to a telegram received at the office of the High Commissioner, the civil government of the territory of New Guinea was formally instituted by Australia on 9th May.   The telegram was worded as follows : The first-administrator of New Guinea is Brigadier-General Evan A. Wisdom, C.B., who, with a staff of officials sent from Australia, has been in New Guinea for2S-2 C
some weeks past. Australian mandate covers the whole of German New Guinea and its associated small islands. By this &quot;transfer: Australia now owns and administers a country outside itself&apos; the future importance.of &quot;which .is highly regarded. New Guinea is only partly explored, and Australian scientists now are engaged in the investigation of its possibilities. But already it is known to be, potentially, a very rich country.Immigration, trade and commerce, as well as shipping, will be entirely in the control of Australia, and as the possibilities of the country are proven, and its productiveness is developed, the value of it will doubtless be great. The number of native inhabitants of New Guinea is nearly &quot;1,000,000. The care of them and the sympathetic study of their interests will be among the foremost duties of the new administration.Finance, die. The official secretary in Great Britain for the Commonwealth has received the following cable from the Prime Minister s Department, Melbourne, dated 29th April :-Mr. Hughes before his departure from the Federal Parliament, speaking with respect to finance, deprecated wild statements concerning Australia&apos;s position. It was impossible for Australia to meet its obligations out of revenue alone, therefore they were compelled to enter local or foreign loan markets. Reckless statements regarding a spendthrift administration were unfounded. Out of 9.8 millions sterling of expenditure for the current year, 03 millions represented statutory obligations which none could repudiate. As for the army and navy expenditure, he would deliberately refuse to cut that down by the thousandth part of a penny until assured of a lasting peace. He hoped to secure such an assurance from the Empire conference.Regarding the pastoral outlook, there was a mountain of surplus wool trembling on the edge of a precipice which threatened to fall and utterly crush the industry. The.wool market had declined so much that wooltops, which 10 months ago were worth 1.4s., were down to 4s. A great deal of inferior wool would not pay for carbonization or transport overseas. Pastoralists, ignoring his counsel, had adopted a free market scheme which had failed miserably, lie was convinced that the British-Australian Wool Realization Association^ remedy would not cure the disease. In his opinion there was only one solution; viz., to keep Bawra wool out of the market altogether. He ventured td say that Great Britain and Australia would have been well advised to accept such a solution. Judge Higgins had suggested a fixed price of 9d&quot;. per lb., or a penny less than the pre-war price. Mr, Hughes suggested fixing the price at Sd. if this lower rate would prevent the utter collapse of the wool market-He asked Parliament to restrict exportation until he had discussed the situation with the Imperial Government.As regards wheat, the Commonwealth Government considered, that the time had arrived for the restoration of pre-war marketing methods, and would take no step itself to form a pool. The Australian Wheat Board had sold about 55-1.- million bushels at a price equal to 9s. &apos;6\d. per bushel free on board.SOUTH AFRICA.Coaling Appliances at Lourenqo Marques. On 28th April the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State that his Ministers stated that the coaling appliances at Lourenco Marques had again broken clown, resulting in serious interruption to the loading of export and coal bunkers from the Transvaal at that port. The appliances at Lourenco Marques had been out of commission from 23rd March to 12th April and this further interruption was seriously affecting the Onion coal trade. In view of the shortage of coal occasioned through the difficulty in Great Britain the Government of the Union of South Africa was most anxious that South Africa should be able to meet the orders placed with its mines. There were 10 steamers at Lourenco Marques requiring 35,870 tons of coal, and his Ministers would appreciate any influence that His Majesty&apos;s Government could bring to bear on the authorities in Lisbon with a a view to action to ensure freedom from interruption to the coaling appliances at Lourenco Marques in future.Proposed Amendment of the Covenant of the League of Nations. On 30th April the following telegram was sent by the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : .
My Ministers deprecate separate action without previous consultation among the members of the British Empire on a matter of such importance as an amendment of the Covenant of: the League of Nations. Such action is calculated to lead to unneces-sary differences between them at the next general meeting of the assembly. My Ministers suggest that the proposed amendment to the Covenant be discussed between the Imperial Government, Mr. Balfour, and the Dominion Prime Ministers this summer in London with a view to arriving at some agreement on the amendments to be supported by the British Empire. If this is accepted, the other Dominions to be notified accordingly.The Versailles Treaty. Reuter&apos;s agent reported from Capetown on 29th April that the Gazette had published a notification for general information that the Union Government did not. intend, in the event of voluntary default by Germany in the performance of her obligations under part 8 of the treaty of Versailles, to exercise their rights to seize the property of German nationals in the Union under para. 18 of annex 2 to that part of the treaty.The Asiatic Question. ReuteFs Capetown agent telegraphed as follows on 3rd May :- &apos;The blouse of Assembly to-clay discussed a motion submitted by a Natal member requesting the Government, in drafting legislation as a result of the report of the Asiatic Commission, to consider the advisability of embodying therein provisions which (as would appear to be feasible in view of section 147 of the South Africa Act) would allocate to the Asiatic community separate and distinct areas, rural and urban, in the Union, where they could develop in accordance with their own differing needs and standards of civilization, due regard being had, in such legislation, to the interests of the present and future European and native population of South Africa.
