GREAT BRITAIN.Unemployment Situation. The following summary of the situation is taken from the special report on unemployment for the week ending 23rd June, issued by the Ministry of Labour : It was hoped that the termination of the dispute in the engineering industry would, in some quarters at least, result in a revival of trade. In point of fact, some only of the men affected have been re-engaged, as many of the firms concerned have insufficient work to enable them to re-engage all their workpeople. In the ship-building industry very little constructional work is to be obtained, and apart from repair work, which is brisk in the north-eastern division, not much improvement is to be expected. The volume of unemployment in coal mines continues to be abnormal. No improvement, may be looked for until a resumption of work occurs in the engineering industry. In the iron and steel industry the position remains much the same in the Midlands, but further discharges are occurring in Scotland. In some parts of the north-eastern and Wales divisions, however, trade shows an upward tendency. The building trade is quiet in the south-eastern, north-western and Wales divisions, but in the south-western division some slight improvement has been recorded. From most divisions reports indicating a steady increase of employment in the clothing industry have been received. Trade is brisk in the hosiery and woollen and worsted trades in the Midlands and in the north-eastern divisions, but no change is reported from Scotland, where, however, there is some activity in the linen and regular employment in the linoleum trades. The revival in the jute industry has not been maintained. Some improvements in the lace industry have been recorded at Barnstaple and Exeter, while the glove trade is brisk at Barnstaple. Increased activity is reported in the Lancashire cotton mills. Unemployment in the transport services is particularly acute at Bristol and Southampton. Transport workers are working full time at Barry, while some improvement has been reported at the Newport and Swansea docks. The situation in the pottery industry in the Midlands remains almost unchanged, but there is some slight tendency towards improvement. In the south-western division the paper-making and printing trades have suffered a set-back. In Scotland the fishing industry is reported as having a very unsuccessful season. There is no improvement in the industrial outlook in the slate quarries of North Wales.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.PALESTINE.Administrative Report [B.E.R., Ixxi, p. 2]. The administrative report for the month of May 1922 contains the following information concerning the agricultural service and harvest prospects :-&quot; The drought has continued unbroken in all districts during the past mouth, intensified during the first week by sirocco winds, but relieved later by cool south-westerly breezes and heavy night dews. Little hope is now entertained of rainfall in appreciable quantity before the autumn.&quot; The effects of drought have been relatively serious in the southern and central districts, but are compensated, in some measure, by the excellent character of early sown winter crops in Samaria, Galilee and Phoenicia.&quot;The grain market is reported to be remaining stagnant, and no offers are forth-coming in the Galilee district for the wheat and barley stacked and awaiting sale. An unabsorbed surplus from last year remains on the hands of both merchants and cultivators, and it is expected that the fellahin will find difficulty in redeeming their tithes unless there is an early revival of trade.The foUowing extract from the report shows how the forest service is being protcted :-&quot; A modified system for the control of felling of olives, carobs and other fruit trees has been adopted; licences to fell olive trees are only to be given over the signature of the Chief Forest Officer, based upon the personal inspection and report of&apos;a Forest Sub-Inspector or Agricultural Assistant; removal passes are required before the timber can be transported for sale, and such timber is to be stamped with
the official marking hammer. By such means it is hoped further to limit the illegal and improvident destruction of productive olive trees. Wood merchants are, in consequence&quot;, organizing the importation of timber and charcoal from Salonica, Beirut and Transjordauia. Forest licences to the number of 437 were issued during April, and  E.262 collected in fees. &apos; Forty-six convictions for forest offences - were&apos; obtained.&quot;The natural history of the country is being studied, as is indicated by the following extract: -&apos;&apos; Natural history notes have been prepared by the Department, in consultation with private collectors, for publication. A Palestine Natural History Society is being promoted to act as a permanent advisory body in all matters relating to indigenous fauna and flora.&quot;Under the heading of Commerce and Industry the report relates that only 900 tourists arrived in Jerusalem during the month of April, a less number than had been anticipated ; &quot; the commercial situation, however, showed considerable improve-meut due to spring purchases and merchants&apos; orders for summer goods, as well as to the prevailing feeling of confidence and security.&quot;Further items regarding the development of commerce and industry are reported in the following extracts : &quot; A society has been formed under the name of &apos; Merkaz Misliari&apos; (Commercial Centre, Ltd.), Jerusalem, with the object of constructing a new commercial centre in Jerusalem. A site has been acquired 30,000 square pics in area, of which 20,000 pics will be used for the erection of shops, offices and store depdts. The total cost of the enterprise will be about  E.225,000, towards which the society expects to raise  E.100,000 from its members, the balance to be obtained by mort-gages and loans for periods of 10-12 years.&quot;&quot;A loan of  E. 67,000 has been advanced by the Anglo-Egyptian Bank to the municipality of Tel Aviv for the purpose of building a new commercial centre, consisting of 150 shops and store rooms.&quot;&apos;.&quot; The Standard Oil Company are carrying out a geological survey of the Dead Sea area and areas west and south-west of it.&quot;Regarding imports and exports the report states : &quot;The value of imports for the month of April is  E.445,565, a decrease of  E.4,775 under the corresponding month of last year, and of exports  E. 162,448, showing an increase of  E.56,938.&quot;&quot;There is a decrease of  E.120,371 in the value of imports for the month of April under March, and a decrease of  E. 13,458 in the value of exports.&quot;&quot; The import duty collected on tobacco products, including tombac, during the month of April is  E. 19,371, an increase of  E.5,t54 as compared with March 1922.&quot;The statistics of immigration and travel are shown in the following paragraphs : &quot;Four thousand one hundred and forty-three travellers entered Palestine during April, and 2,302 left, the latter including 130 emigrants (Jews 38, Christians 39, Moslems 53) and 129 immigrants (Jews 65, Moslems 64) who decided not to remain.&quot; Seven hundred and eighty-eight immigrants, of whom 769 were Jews, entered Palestine during the same period ; of the Jewish immigrants, 264- came from Ukraine , -and 243 from Poland.&quot;Among the immigrants were 20 farmers with their families, the advance party of an organization in Transylvania, which has purchased a considerable area of land in Galilee. The group brought agricultural implements, live stock, machinery and building material, of which the value has been estimated at  E.40,000.&quot; In addition, 337 persons belonging to a society known as the Bershat Co-operative were admitted, who introduced machinery valued at  E.10,000;&quot; Two. hundred and thirty-five tourists entered Palestine through Kantara.&quot;Fifty-one immigrants-who failed to comply with the Palestine Immigration Regulations were refused admittance.&quot;The following extracts report on the labour position : &quot; There have been several labour disputes during the past month.   The claim of ; the trade unions to be given a deciding voice in ali appointments and dismissals by &quot;employers led to strikes at two factories in Jaffa and to a -lock-out in the building . trade at Tel-Aviv.   About 200 men were involved.   In all three cases a mediation committee appointed by. the Zionist Executive intervened, and pending an expression -of opinion by them, work was resumed after only a few days&apos; cessation.
;&quot; With the change in the command of the troops in Palestine which came into force on the 1st of April, the Egyptian Labour Corps was disbanded and its members returned to Egypt.   Civilian labour for the army is now recruited locally.&quot;The Department of Public Works has been joined during the month by three officials qualified as A.M.I.C.E., and a decision has been come to that military works in Palestine shall be taken over by the department.IRAQ.The following paragraphs are taken from the Iraq Intelligence Report for 1st June : -&apos; Treftty with Najd. At a meeting of the Council of Ministers held on 9th May, &apos;the provisions of the treaty with Najd were considered. Some debate arose over Article 6, but the Minister of Public Works, who had been the Iraq delegate at the negotiations, explained that he considered it. to be harmless, and that as long as Ibn Sand was bound to the British Government by treaty he could not sign a treaty with Iraq which did not contain a provision of this nature. The Council accepted the treaty, which has subsequently received the consent of the King and been published. At the request of the Prime Minister the High Commissioner communicated to Ibn Saud King FeisaPs approval of the treaty, and expressed his hope that he might shortly receive a similar acceptance and approval from him.The publication of this treaty has called forth virulent comments in the extreme nationalist press in Baghdad. It is not the subject-matter of the treaty which is criticized, but the fact that a &quot; third party &quot; appears as signatory, i.e., Great Britain, in the person of the Secretary to the High Commissioner, the fact being that but for the presence of the third party there would have been no treaty. The 6th article, which provides for the abrogation of the treaty in case of a break with His Majesty&apos;s &apos; Government on the part of either of the contracting States, arouses much mortification in the same quarters, but elsewhere the terms of the tr-treaty have been accepted with satisfaction.The Anglo-Persian Oil Company. At a meeting of the Council on 13th May a letter from the High Commissioner was read to the Council, in which Plis Excellency suggested that the Iraq Government should recognize in principle the position of the &apos; Anglo-Persian Oil Company in&quot; the transferred territories on the basis of the Darcy concession and that the Ministers of Finance and Commerce should enter into negotiations with the representatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with a view to. arriving at a working arrangement.The Minister of Commerce (Ja&apos;far Chalabi Abu Timman) objected : (a) That the Ottoman Government had not come to an agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as to any specific point in Iraq to which a pipe line could be run, and that the Iraq Government must either agree to fix a point or the Anglo-Persian Oil Company be content to export its products through the Persian Gulf.(b) That a pipe line if laid through Iraq territory must be used exclusively for exporting the products of the&apos; transferred territories and could not be used for exporting oil derived from Persian territory.(c) That the Sublime Porte had not declared its recognition of the provisions of the protocol, and that in consequence the Iraq Government had the right to consider their modification, if they thought fit.(d) That whereas it was provided that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should pay 16 per cent, of its net profits to the Ottoman Government, it was common knowledge that the company paid not only 16 per cent, to the Persian Government, but also 10 per cent, to the Bakhtiari Chiefs. The Iraq Government could therefore rightfully claim 26 per cent, from the company.Anti-Mandate Campaign, A violent anti-mandate campaign has been carried on by the extreme Nationalist press, culminating in the publication in the Mufid (ex-Lisan al Arab) on 24th May of a telegram from Shaikh Mahdi al Khalisi to one of his supporters in Najaf.   It runs as follows : ,: The Moslems and the people of Iraq having verbally and in writing and under seal and signature entrusted to us the reins of their affairs, we are thereby rendered responsible for the consequences of failure on our part to reject (orig. should we not reject) any treaty prejudicial to the complete independence of the people of Iraq such as we have ascertained (to have been proposed).&quot; It will be remembered that the Lisan al Arab was killed by an adverse fatwah pronounced by Shaikh Mahdi; the teeth of the Mufid have been set on edge.
Basrah.-In connexion with the anti-mandate campaign, the press has busied itself with garbled accounts of the genesis and objects of the petition submitted last year by the inhabitants of Basrah, coupled with severe strictures on their alleged wish to become a &quot; colony.&quot; As a result of representations from the Basrah member of the Cabinet, &quot;Abdul Muhsin Sa&apos;dun, the Minister of Interior, sent a letter to all vernacular papers, explaining that the incident referred to occurred a year ago, and was conducted by persons whose national sentiments are above suspicion, and adding that as there can be no doubt that Basrah support Iraq unity and is loyal to the King, prejudicial statements should be avoided by editors of newspapers. With this somewhat jejune utterance &quot;Abdul Muhsin appears to be content, while the papers have dropped the subject.INDIA.The Fortnightly Report. The following information, dated 3rd July, has been received from the Government of India :-Madras. The political situation is quiet and Ramadan passed off without incident. Efforts have been made to induce mohamedans to wear khaddar (native cloth) in mosques, but with no real success. In three districts action has been taken under the security sections of the Criminal Procedure Code against non-co-operators, but in spite of this there are distinct signs that the congress creed is losing ground.A few well-known extremists have published a scheme for a Hindustan panchayat, that is, an organization of parallel government, in selected villages. The scheme includes a village executive in charge of separate departments, village courts and schools, a monthly budget and taxation, a gazette, a yearly meeting of all inhabitants on Gandhi clay, an attempt at a post office system ; and the authors talk of trying it at once in a small portion of Madras. Town inhabitants are not likely to be enthusiastic over such a movement. The scheme hardly needs serious notice, but developments are being watched. The Moplah rebel leader Avokkar Musaliar has been captured in South Kanara district.Bombay.-There is nothing of particular importance.Bengal. The Bengal congress committee have passed resolutions that the Bogra resolution of 23rd March postponing civil disobedience should be rescinded, and that disobedience of orders under section 14-1 Criminal Procedure Code should be authorized, provided that non-violence is observed and that persons disobeying orders are duly qualified for individual civil disobedience. These resolutions were passed without the qualification that they should be confirmed by the All-India committee. There has, however, been no increase in activity in Bengal, and district organizations are making practically no progress. Volunteers are losing enthusiasm owing to the apathy of the people. A notable feature of Id prayers on the Calcutta maidan was the reappearance of volunteers with cross belts and crescents for the first time since the proclamation of these associations as illegal bodies. Various caliphate leaders are quarrelling amongst themselves. Political enthusiasm is generally on the wane, and with the setting in of the monsoon there is little likelihood of any recrudescence for some time. .United Provinces. The political outlook is quiet on the surface throughout the greater part of the provinces, but the period is marked by factors for quiescence, viz., the harvest, the intense heat, Ramadan, the activity of the wedding season and the incarceration of numerous leaders which is now coming to an end. Signs of increased activity are not wanting, and the Commissioners generally regard the future with doubt and anxiety. Meetings of the All-India caliphate committee and the congress at Lucknow are the chief political events and are -calculated to re-kindle agitation. Hindu-moslem unity appears to be waning and&apos;mohamedans are increasingly restive of hindu dominance. The delay in the settlement of the Turkish question is seriously affecting mohamedans generally. Two police constables were shot by an unknown person in Bareilly on 22nd June. . Pandit Mafaviya has addressed meetings in the Gorakhpur district, in defiance of prohibitory orders under section 144, Criminal Procedure Code. (Gorakhpur is the district in which police were massacred at Chauri-Chaura.)Punjab. There are no developments in the political situation in spite of the withdrawal of the Seditious Meetings Act in Lahore, Amritsar and Sheikhpura. There has been no marked revival of agitation in those districts or elsewhere, though a number of political meetings have been held. It is reported that the speakers are more violent than menacing. Volunteers are little in evidence. Congress workers are devoting attention to the khaddar campaign, which, in its present form, is com-paratively unobjectionable. Political prisoners give a certain amount of trouble, 42-1 b
particularly in Mianwali. The Id festival passed off quietly. The attitude of akalis (a sikh sect) -is reported in some districts to be friendly. A satisfactory solution of the gurdwara (shrine) question would be likely to put&apos;an end to sikh agitation. The opposition to the bill is probably clue to the desire to use the anxiety of the Government as a lever to secure the release of akalis now in jail. There are some indications of dissension amongst the leaders. A party of akalis, marching in military formation in the Luclhiana district, were broken up after some resistance, and a few arrests were made. The outlook is comparatively calm. It is uncertain whether the sikhs in general will pppose the gurdwara bill, but present indications are that there will not be a serious recrudescence of akali difficulties.Bihar and Orissa. The political situation is quiet; interest in non-co-operation has abated. Considerably fewer meetings have been held and those have been poorly attended, A new temperance movement has been started amongst the aborigines in Chota Nagpur, but this is mainly agrarian and social. The Commissioner of Orissa reports that the non-co-operation movement has received a serious set-back through the arrests of three of the prominent agitators. Discontent is reported on the East Indian railway at Asansol, and there are rumours of another general strike towards the end of-this month.Central Provinces.&apos; The struggle continues between the pro-Tilak and pro-Gandhi parties. The pro-Tilak party seem to have a majority in Mahratta, but not in Hindustan districts. The pro-Gandhi party leaders continue to address meetings with a view to prepare the ground for civil disobedience. Little enthusiasm is aroused. Otherwise the province is quiet, and in Chattisgarli the situation has greatly changed for the better. Some of the municipal committees are threatening action on non-co-operation lines, and the non-co-operation party are feeling their way towards a different attitude on local -bodies.Assam. Pandit Malaviya has toured in Assam and districts. At Gauhati he behaved discreetly, but elsewhere was less guarded, and apprehensions are felt by local officers as to the result of his campaign, particularly in attracting to the movement persons hitherto holding aloof. In Surma Valley all is quiet and there is no prospect of political trouble in the near future.Delhi. There has been a slight recrudescence of political activity. Several meetings have been held emphasising the necessity of making up for time lost owing to the Seditious Meetings Act. More offensive speakers are being closely watched and action is proposed against individuals whenever good evidence is available, and it is hoped that this may obviate the necessity for a general prohibition of public meetings.North-West Frontier Province.-The excitement caused by the sittings of the Frontier Enquiry Committee is subsiding throughout the province, and it is generally recognized that the agitation for amalgamation originated with the hinclu community, and would serve only sectarian interests.General. A growing cleavage between mohamedans and the non-co-operationist party was also manifest in the discussions at Lucknow. The more fanatical among the former, disgusted with the failure of the non-co-operationist movement to secure redress of the caliphate grievances, Avere in favour of action being taken on more drastic lines than hitherto attempted. At a meeting of the executive committee of the Jamiatululema a proposal Avas put forward by tAVO maulvis, one of whom was a member of the silk letter conspiracy, that for starting civil disobedience fidais should be appointed on the system of the Hussan Bin Sabbah of the Ismailia sect in Egypt. This proposal was opposed and dropped. Tbe formation of a mohamedan society for the purpose of assassination in the Punjab is also reported, but the information received is open to doubt, and has not yet been properly confirmed. It is impossible to say Avhether, behind the talk indulged in by fanatical mohamedans, there is any real intention to have recourse to deeds of violence. We have, however, warned local Governments and have impressed on them the. necessity, not only of being on the watch for developments of this kind, but, should any assassinations or attempts at assassination occur, of prompt and vigorous action.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Radio Corporation of America-On 24th June the following telegram Avas sent to the Governor-General by the Secretary of State for the Colonies :-His Majesty&apos;s Government have been informed that the Radio Corporation of America recently despatched a representative to Japan with the object of concluding
an exclusive traffic agreement under which all Japanese traffic would he diverted for a stipulated period through the Radio Corporation^ United States station. It is also stated that the Radio Corporation contemplate demanding that not only all traffic for the United States should be transmitted to them from Japan, but also that they should handle messages destined for Canada and Europe. His Majesty&apos;s Government have no special reason to think that the Japanese Government would .accede to such a request, but they are of opinion that if your Ministers agree it would be desirable to make representations to the Government of Japan in general terms against any action which might prejudice direct wireless communication between Canada and Japan or between Japan to the United Kingdom through Canada.It might be added to the Japanese Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government nre about to discuss with Canadian Government representatives, who are shortly coming to this country, the question of a high-power wireless station in Western Canada, and that it is hoped that a station which would be available for communication with Japan may be erected there shortly.Ratification of Treaties [B.E.R., lxix, p. GJ. On 5th July the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that on 3rd July an Order in Council had been approved ratifying the following Washington treaties : Limitation of Naval Armaments ; Conditions in the Far East and the Chinese Customs Tariff; Protection of Neutrals and Non-combatants at Sea in time of War ; Prevention of use in War of noxious Gases and Chemicals; and Preservation of the General Peace and Main-tenance of Rights in relation to insular Possessions and Dominions in the region of the Pacific.AUSTRALIA.Grown Lands for Settlers, The Times Melbourne correspondent reported on 4th July :- -(.1) That the New South Wales Parliament had met that day, and that it had been announced that the Government -was seeking the co-operation and financial support of the federal and imperial authorities to develop Crown lands under a system of community settlement which would include citizens and immigrants.(2) The Victorian Parliament had also opened that day. The Governor&apos;s-speech declared the State financially sound, and promised a comprehensive scheme of general land settlement, which would be carried out in conjunction with the immigration plans.(3) The first session of the Queensland Parliament since it was reduced to one Chamber had also opened that clay. It was announced that the Government was zealously co-operating with the Commonwealth Government in the immigration scheme adopted last year.SOUTH AFRICA.The Barcelona Declaration [B.E.R., lxx., p. 5]. On 22nd June the Governor-General reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that, in connexion with the instruments adopted at this conference, his Ministers had informed the Secretary-General of the League of Nations under date 28th April that owing to its geographical position the Union was not affected by the conventions and therefore did not propose either to grant or withhold their accession. In view, however, of the opinion expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, his Ministers had no objection to the declaration regarding the flag of nations having no sea-coast being ratified on their behalf, and would be glad if arrangements could be made accordingly. They left the question of procedure for the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The following items of information -were telegraphed by Renter s agents :-Breakdown of Mozambique Negotiations. Announcing in the House of Assembly to-day the breakdown of the negotiations between Portugal and South Africa, General Smuts, the Prime Minister, stated that the negotiations were confined almost entirely to a new railway agreement.The Mozambique Convention, which lapses on 31st March 1923, he said, provides for the establishment of a railway council on which both Governments shall be equally represented. The arrangement, however, was unworkable and inoperative. Last year&apos;the Union had exported about a million tons of coal via Delagoa, and the Transvaal colliery owners had assured the Government of their ability almost immediately to treble that exportation.   The Government was therefore most anxious
to create port facilities at Delagoa to be able to cope with this development, and had proposed a real board of control and management resembling the Suez Canal Commission, independent of both Governments, the Union Government having a majority in representation, a majority to which it was entitled. The Government had succeeded on neither point. General D&apos;Andrade, who was acquainted with the Unions views and understood the difficulties and urgencies of the whole situation, would lay the position before the Lisbon Government, and possibly the negotiations would be resumed. The Government, however, was prepared to get along without a convention rather than with an ineffective one which would hamper the development of the country.The native recruiting arrangements would then lapse, but the mines might possibly make their own arrangements with the Portuguese.   [Capetown, 23rd June.];Political Parties. Speaking at Montagu to-day, General Smuts, the Prime Minister, predicted the disappearance of the old Nationalist and Labour parties, which, he said, would be replaced by a Nationalist-Labour party.He further prophesied that the formation of such a party would result in the return to the South African party of thousands of Nationalists who left it in 1912. [Capetown, 26th June.]Railways-Mr. Jagger, Minister for Railways, moving the second reading of the Railways Bill in the Union House of Assembly to-day, said that the demand for new railways was more insistent every year. The Government could not wait for the prices of materials to decline further. Four million pounds was the most the country could afford at present. The lines would be constructed as cheaply as possible, and had been selected with a view to the greatest agricultural develop-ment. The Bill authorized the Government to electrify railway lines, and the Government intended to start on the Maritzburg-Glenco section, which was in every way most suitable for electrification, as the present congestion on that line was hampering the coal industry of Natal. The Bill was in general favourably received, apart from Nationalist criticism of the selection of the districts. [Capetown, 21st June.]The new railways which the Union Government has decided to construct, as-announced by Mr. Jagger, Minister for Railways, in moving the second reading of the Railways Bill in the Union House of Assembly on the 21st instant, are as follows: Belmont to Douglas, Dunsvvart to Apex, Ermelo to Lothair, Fort Beaufort to Balfour, a two-foot gauge line from Frankfort to Villiers joining up with the Transvaal Natal main line, FranklinUo Kokstad, Franklin to Matatiele, George to Knysna, Harrismith to AVarden, Heilbron to Petrussteyn, Hercules to Magaliesberg, Kamfersdam to Wintersrush, Klipdale to Bredasdorp, Lydenburg to Olifantspoortje, Nylstroom to Vaalwater, Oudtshoorn to Calitzdorp, Rustenburg to Boschnoek, Senekal to Marquard, Settlers to Truinplaats, Touwariver to Ladismith, Upington to Kakamas, and a two-foot gauge line from Zastron to Wepener. Practically all ,will be agricultural lines.   [Capetown, 24th June]Mining Industry. Speaking at the meeting of the Chamber of Mines to-day, the acting-president, Sir Evelyn Wallers, dwelt on the. improved economic basis which had followed the recent upheaval, the most important factor of which, he said, was-the re-establishment of managerial control. He declared that there was no intention of adopting an unreasonable attitude towards the employees,, but the mine managers must be masters in their own house. The reduction of working costs had. now become possible, and there was a promise of a return to the&apos; pre-war figure of 17s. per ton at no distant future. Such a reduction would bring within payable limits 228,000,000-more tons of ore for the present producing companies and 300,000,000 tons more in other areas. One step was still necessary to place the industry on a permanent sound basis. That was the removal of the embargo on tropical natives. Incidentally, Sir Evelyn Wallers pointed out that the mining industry would have to pay practically the whole of the tax on employers of labour, notice of which was recently given by the-Administrator.   [Johannesburg, 26th June.]The Transvaal Advertisement Tax. The voting on the Bill providing for a 10 per cent, tax on advertisements, which -was introduced in the Provincial Council on Thursday last, resulted in the first place in its rejection by 19 votes to 18, which vote was, however, subsequently converted into a tie, owing to one Labour vote being disallowed.   The question was thus lost.   [Pretoria, 21st June.]
