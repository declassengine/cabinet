GREAT BRITAIN.Tlie Unemployment Situation. The following summary of the situation is taken from the special report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 28th April: The dispute in the engineering and shipbuilding trades is exercising an adverse effect not only on the prospects of the two industries concerned but on industry generally, and may be regarded as having definitely put back the improvement which, was anticipated in most parts of the country.In coal-mining there has been a slight set-back, notably in the north-western division and in Scotland,- but reabsorption continues in Wales, and considerable improvement has taken place in the north and north-east of England.In the iron and steel industry the tone is varied. There is some improvement in Wales and the north of England, but heavy discharges have taken place in the Midlands.In the chemical industry in South Wales the men have returned to work pending a settlement of the trade dispute, which has been in progress for a considerable period.Generally speaking, the engineering and shipbuilding industries are at present dormant, and it is reported that an increasing amount of repair work is being sent to the continent. The only section of the engineering industry which shows signs of activity is motor engineering, and this activity is mainly confined, to the Midlands.In the cotton industry negotiations have been proceeding between employers and workpeople on the question of wages, and a provisional settlement has been arrived at. Recovery in this trade continues to make very slow progress, and short time is generally the rule, although extra machinery is being brought into use in anticipation of increased business.In the hosiery and woollen trades the position is fairly good, and there has been improvement in boot and shoe manufacture. Orders for jute have decreased, and additional unemployment has resulted.In the plain net and cotton section of the lace industry further improvement is reported. In the clothing and kindred trades the improvement already noticed continues, but building is not quite so good, and the activity anticipated round about he Easter holidays did not materialize.COLONIES  PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.RHODESIA.The Railway Question. On 2&apos;0th April the High Commissioner for South Africa reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that he had received the following-telegram from the Administrator of Southern Rhodesia : In the course of the discussion on railway questions during the recent conference between the Government of the Union, of South Africa and the Rhodesian delegates, attention was drawn to the proposal of the Imperial Trade Facilities Committee to finance the extension of the Lobito railway to the Belgian Congo. Consideration of this matter convinces me that the result of the completion of this line most be to deflect traffic from the Rhodesian. railway system, with disastrous consequences both to the Rhodesian railways, which represent an expenditure ol many millions, and to the development of both Northern and Southern Rhodesia. These territories inevitably will suffer from the higher rates which the railways would have to charge to meet the losses entailed by deflection of traffic and from the inability of the railways to improve or extend their systems. I should be grateful if your Royal Highness would bring to the notice of the Secretary of State the view of the Rhodesian. Administrations that the matter is one of vital importance to both territories and that effect should not be given to the proposals of the Trade Facilities Committee, lam authorised by Sir Charles Coghlan to state that the elected members of the Southern Rhodesia Council associate themselves with this protest.On 2nd May the High Commissioner further reported that the Administrator of Southern Rhodesia had informed him that Sir Charles Coghlan had handed, to him for transmission the following memorandum by the elected members who met at Salisbury that day : The elected members desire to associate themselves with the protest of the Government of the Union of South Africa and the Chartered Company, against financial assistance being afforded by the Imperial Government for the completion of
the Lobito railway, which will seriously prejudice the position in Rhodesia. They submit such assistance could be given more advantageously by shortening the existing rail outlets from the Congo, or by the construction of a railway entirely in British territory to the west coast, rather than to a foreign railway which would compete with lines existing in the Union and in Rhodesia.THE SUDAN.The Future Government. Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 174] from Cairo on 8th May as follows :-I learnt yesterday evening that the commission for the elaboration of the constitution intended to add a clause to the effect that Egypt and the Sudan are one and the same country, also that the King of Egypt is sovereign of the Sudan, but that the system of the government of the Sudan is reserved for later discussion.I immediately sent for the Prime Minister, and told him that the British Government will not approve of a unilateral declaration by Egypt on. this subject. The future of Sudan is one of the reserved points, and no change in the present relations between Great Britain and the Sudan, or Egypt and the Sudan is permisible. If such a clause is put in the constitution it may wreck the whole agreement.The Prime Minister agreed and promised to speak to the commission. He stated that the commission was only an advisory body, and that the Government was not bound to take its advice.I also took steps without delay to prevent the publication of the commissions intention, but found that I had been forestalled by the commission, who had already communicated it to the press.Telegraphing [No. 176] again on 9th May with reference to the foregoing, Lord Allenby reported that the responsibility for the resolution rested with a sub-com-mittee, and had not received the necessary endorsement of the full commission.Regret at the unfortunate impression conveyed by this incident had been expressed by the President of the Council,, who fully shared the view that the incorporation of a clause dealingwith the Sudan in a draft constitution for Egypt would be an improper proceeding on the part of the commission. The Cabinet and Adly Pasha supported him, and it was expected that the admonition he was to deliver to Rushdy Pasha, the chairman of the sub-committee, would carry full weight with the commission.INDIA.The Frontier Situation. On 27th April the Viceroy telegraphed [No. 576] the report received by him of the activities of raiding parties, believed to be of Jalal Khel, against the piquet covering a working party some six miles north of Tank. The piquet was supported by 20 mounted constabulary under a British officer, and a light ensued in which the British officer and his subadar became cut off and were killed. It was also reported that Haji Abdur Raziq, who had been held responsible for the activity of a hostile lashkar against Wana, dispersed by aeroplane action [Nos. 495 and 512], had left Shakin for Urgun, and that the Wana situation was rather easier.The Viceroy&apos;&apos;s Fortnightly Report. The following telegram was sent on 25th April :-Section. 1. Bombay. A series of meetings and intensive propaganda punctuated the national week, but there are indications that the response was generally poor. Hartal enthusiasm on the loth was a languid affair. The political situation is dominated by the Near-East question.Section 2. Hasrat Mohani has been arrested and sent to Ahmedabad, -where he-is confined in jail pending his trial, which, begins on 26th April.Section 3. Bengal. The lull in political activities continues. The organization of the non-co-operation, party goes on withotit interruption, and considerable efforts are being made within narrower limits. The present programme indicates that, in some districts, the extreme wing is becoming more and more restive. The Chittagong conference which is now being held will probably reveal the relative strength of the violence and non-violence parties. Other causes have combined to bring about a calmer political atmosphere, such as lack of funds, confining the activities (sic) of volunteers to collection, the absence of leaders of ability. The recent asserting of authority has acted as a strong deterrent, and much of the glamour of volunteering 40-2 A 2
has been dissipated. In Calcutta meetings have increased in number, but during-.the national week were sparsely attended. No revival of intimidation has been practised by volunteers, and the hartal of 13th April passed off without the tension and inconvenience experienced in November and December. About one-third of the shops were completely closed; one-third were fully and the remainder partially opened. There were no disturbances of any kind in the districts. There have been few out-standing incidents, though the picketing of liquor and cloth shops continues in places. Ladies are prominent in propaganda work ; and efforts are being made to emphasize the inter-independenr, swaraj and caliphate demands. The recalcitrant villages in the Tipperah district are still giving trouble. There have been recent signs of an attempt to organize an agrarian agitation in Bengal. A proposal to decrease tbe acreage under jute was considered by tbe civil disobedience committee, which rejected it. No politician of first rank in Bengal has committed himself to a pro-ryot attitude, but the possibility of such, a development and. the danger involved are being borne in. mind.Section 4. Presiding at a meeting of the Bengal Landholders Association, the-Maharaja Darbhanga urged the landholders to take part in the body politic, to form their own party in the Imperial and Legislative Councils, to watch their interests and privileges, to identify themselves with their tenants and to remove legitimate causes, of discontent.- Section 5. There has been a heavy falling off in the import trade under cotton goods, attributable largely to the intensive non-co-operation agitation. The situation is not altogether clear, but there seems reason to believe that the further activities--of the movement will continue at present on peaceful lines.United Provinces. The political lull continues. The Commissioners are inclined to regard it with suspicion, as being due to temporary causes, such as crop-cutting, disorganization followiug the imprisonment of the leaders, internal- division in the congress ranks and the prevailing uncertainty of the objective. Attention in near-future seems likely to concentrate on tbe foreign cloth question, re-emphasized as one of the points in the construction programme. There was little enthusiasm for the national, week.Punjab. There has been a marked improvement - in the political situation throughout the province. The present congress programme is indefinite and there is little enthusiasm in carrying it out. There was little activity in the national w-eek, and no fresh development of the caliphate movement. The improvement in the general situation is to some extent threatened by the arrival in Lahore of Malaviya. He has twice attempted to hold political meetings in Lahore contrary to the Seditious Meetings Act.Section. 6. At his instance also a committee of 11 Indians, under the presidency of Narendra Nath, was formed to enquire into alleged illegalities and excesses committed by certain Government officials in arresting and trying a large number of persons for alleged offences connected with political unrest in the province. A preliminary meeting has been held and it was resolved to issue a general notice through the press, inviting information.Section 7. The effect of the action taken by the Government against the akalis is reported to be excellent. On the 9th all troops were withdrawn from the districts in which they were not permanently stationed. Additional police are -being retained for the present. The cases are being disposed of as rapidly as possible. The large swords formerly worn by the akalis have largely disappeared ; black turbans and kirpans are pot so much in evidence. Their truculent demeanour has changed for the better. Sanction has been given to tbe prosecution of a number of akalis under sections 124a and 153a of the Indian Penal Code. Generally non-co-operation is temporarily at a standstill, though paid propaganda continues on a large scale. The sudden arrival of Malaviya may revive an interest in political affairs and break the calm. Fortunately, the akali movement has been satisfactorily dealt with, and there should be quietness, at any rate, during tire harvest.Section 8. Sardar Kharak Singh, president of the Shromani prabhandak committee, has been sentenced to three years&apos; ILLSection 9. The Baisakhi celebrations passed off without incident. The akalis are behaving well. It is early to form any final opinion as to the results of the recent action, but this has had a marked effect in checking the growing spirit of lawlessness. The resentment caused by the arrest and prosecution of leaders seems likely, however, to add to the difficulty of finding a permanent solution of the gurdwara question. Malaviya is said to be appointing sub-committees in several districts, who will report-
to the central committee mentioned above. The Deputy-Commissioners are being asked to satisfy themselves that no persons are arrested without due cause, and to report, for orders of the Government, cases of any persons convicted, in which the conviction appears to be of doubtful legality or equity. Further, a letter just received from the Punjab Government states that the immediate object of Malaviya&apos;s visit has been to -effect a reconciliation between non-co-operators and nationalists, and to form a national party under his leadership, but so far he has met with little success, ft is proposed, before he leaves, to give him confidentially the precis of instructions issued to district officers and a statement of the illegal action of the akalis; but he is bitter over the prohibition of two meetings which he attempted to hold in Lahore, and seems determined to do his best to manufacture a second set of Punjab wrongs on the 1919 model. The Governor in Council is satisfied that the meetings were rightly prohibited, and also that full discretion has been exercised in regard to all persons recently arrested, except iu the Sialkot districts, where the net was at first thrown rather too wide and a number of those arrested have recently been released oil the instructions of the Commissioner. No further arrests are being made for offences committed before 1st April.Bihar and Orissa, Incendiarism has been reported from one or two places. Indigo factories have been burnt down in Muzalfarpur, Oudh and Partabgarh. An attack on a temporary police station was easily dealt with. Peaceful conditions prevail in Tirhoot. The panic caused by the (ires in Cuttack has subsided, though the alarm spread to the interior of the district and armed police had to be sent to Kenadorpara. In Cuttack there were 83 fires. There have been several fires in Puri. In Cuttack and in Gaya tenants are giving trouble. Swarai Jembidyanad is making some enquiries on behalf of the Raja of Kanika which have led to considerable agitation. The Government may have to interfere and arrange for a more honest and impartial investigation of tenants&apos; complaints.Section f U. Several persons have been released as a result of Mr. Justice Mnllick&apos;s scrutiny of the convictions under Criminal law Amendment Act. 301 cases were examined ; in 213 no action has been necessary, as the sentences were fines&apos;which had been paid, or short terms of imprisonment which had been served, and he recommended suspension of the sentence in three cases only. In most of the 85 remaining cases he recommended suspension, reduction,. or commutation of the sentence; he also scrutinized all proceeding since 1st January 1921 under sections 124a, 153a and 505 of the Indian Penal Cole, and sections .107 and 108 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and found the orders justified in all but four unimportant cases, in which orders of release have been issued. Public meetings have been badly attended and the idea of the national week of self-denial was not popular. The attempted hartal on the 13th and I 17th was half-hearted.Section  11.    Central Provinces. The extremist leaders,  by meetings and -distributing leaflets, tried In arouse enthusiasm for the national week, but the meetings were poorly attended and the audience apathetic.   It is rumoured that Khaparde accepted the leadership of the  Mahratta nationalist party on condition that the members agreed to stand as candidates for councils at the next elections.   Responsive co-operation is to be the watchword, and the party hope to capture the congress -councils, &amp;c.   The picketing of liquor shops was half-hearted at a few centres.   In Chattisgarh a movement is on foot- to start an association on the hues of Kishau Sahba, and one of the leaders has exhorted cultivators neither to sell grain, nor to buy silver.   The main danger is that ignorant audiences may interpret lectures as advice not to pay rents or revenues.   There has been some unrest among the mahars -of Berar.Section 12. At Nagpur, Mrs. Naidu said that the talk of entering the councils was premature, when Gandhi and many others were in jail; she would not object to a change of programme, but at present they had. to concentrate their energies on -carrying out Gandhi&apos;s message. At the Central Provinces provincial league all office bearers and members of the working committee resigned because a certain member of -the committee had been criticizing their action in. the press.Section 13. Delhi. There has been no political activity to report; national .week roused, no interest; there was a very partial hartal on the 14th. The recru.it-ment of the congress members attracted less attention than usual. Collecting subscriptions is almost impossible. The extremist . newspapers, which ceased publication last year, have reappeared. Ordinary crime shows a marked increase; attributable, in some measure, to the weakening of the usual respect for the forces of aw and order.   Business in the piece-goods market has improved.
Section 14&apos;i    North-West Frontier Province. The restrictions on postal and -telegraphic facilities in the city were removed on 13th April.   The chief event has been the visit of his Excellency the Viceroy, whose speeches on the caliphate question gave great satisfaction.   The political, situation is generally satisfactory.   The crop prospects are excellent and prices are falling.Section 15. Assam. There is nothing of importance to report. The lull continues. Villagers in the Assam valley are disgusted by the failure of the movement to save them from payment of the land revenue. In the Surma valley the news is satisfactory. All is quiet on the tea gardens. Hats are being held regularly in all. districts and interference therewith seems to have subsided.General.-The political, situation continues quiet. A general hartal, was observed on the 13th, but half-heartedly, and no disturbance occurred.The statement in our previous telegram that the 18th had been the day fixed On was based on the Associated Press telegram, winch was later contradicted. The next session of the All-India Congress meeting is to be held at Gaya.Malaviya seems making a bid for the leadership of the movement in succession to Gandhi, but, as already indicated, he is unlikely to be accepted by the non-co-operators. The latter are at present somewhat disorganized and uncertain as to the objective, and this&apos;, together with excellent harvests and the firm action of the Government, has resulted in a general lull, which, so far as present indications goy may continue till June at any rate.THE DOMINIONS.Ratification of Treaties. On .10th May the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed as follows to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa :-It is probable that the ratification by His Majesty of all treaties signed at Washington will have to be deferred until legislation has been passed here giving effect to the naval treaty ; but His Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad of early advice as to whether your Ministers concur in the ratification when the time comes.AUSTRALIA. -Trade. According to a communique issued from the office of the High Commissioner in London on 8th May the value of the goods imported, during the month of March 1922 was 8,817,112Z. and that of the exports 13,327,7701., of which all but 350,543?. was Australian produce.NEW ZEALAND.Meal. On 9th May the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that quite recently, following the establishment of the Meat Producers Control Board, Messrs. Armour and Company have resumed business under conditions which they themselves offered, namely, that they would place themselves entirely in the hands of the Board referred to and that their meat should be handled, pooled, shipped and marketed in accordance with the desires of the Board. The position, therefore, is that while the Company has not been granted a meat exporters licence in the terms of the Slaughtering and Inspection Amendment Act, 1918, its meat will be exported under the control of the Meat Producers Control Board.SOUTH AFRICA.Signature of League of Nations Protocols [B.E.R., XVIII, p. 5].-On 8th May the Governor-General telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : My Ministers concur in the ratification of protocols embodying the proposed amendments, with the exception of Article 16. The High Commissioner of the Union of South Africa will be asked to arrange for the signature as soon as he returns from Genoa:
Section 14; North-West Frontier Province. The restrictions on postal and telegraphic facilities in the city were removed on 1-8th April.
