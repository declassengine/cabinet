GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the report on the Labour situation issued by the Ministry of Labour on loth September : The Trade Unions Congress. The trade unions congress concluded its annual session at Cardiff on Saturday, the 10th instant.Taking the conference as a whole, the two most notable debates perhaps were those on the question of armaments and on the central control of disputes. In both pf these there was a real clash of reasoned opinion that was fought out in. debate, instead of as is so often the case the Government, employers or some other dummy, being set up and shot at from all sides. The whole meeting, however, gave the impression that the importance of constructive thought is being more definitely realized: indirectly connected with this, the interest shown in matters connected witli education was notable. The fate of the many resolutions, however, dealing with matters of domestic concern to the trade union movement, such as those regarding men in the railway workshops and the triple alliance, ouce more demonstrated the fact that the congress is not a body capable of settling difficult matters of dispute.Unemployment.- Public attention is concentrated to a considerable degree upon the unemployment. positiou and the parliamentary committee of the trade unions congress is about to conduct a national Labour campaign in support of the policy on this subject adopted by the congress last week. The centre-point of the campaign will apparently be a demand for the immediate termination of the parliamentary recess. The estimated total on the live register of all employment exchanges on the 9th September was 1,502,600, as compared with 1,527,500, the corresponding figure for the previous week. It is estimated that some 290,000 persons have exhausted their unemployment benefit rights, for trie current benefit period, which, ends on the 1st November.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.KENYA.        - *The Recent l^roubles. On 12th September Reuter announced that its agency had been informed that the Government had so far received no news of any fresh disturbances in East Africa, but had telegraphed for information. The position, as was known, had caused some anxiety up to a month earlier, but since then the messages had been reassuring, and - it was believed that quiet had been restored. This view was shared by the Governor of Kenya, Sir E. Northey, who had left London the week before on his return to Nairobi. There was no anxiety whatever for British settlers. The real difficulty arose from the fact that a large and waterless desert intervened between the British and the Abyssinian territory, making the railway operation a difficult one. Some time before a British post had been moved slightly into Abyssinian territory, a fact of which the Italian and the Abyssinian Governments had been apprised; the latter being informed that as soon as it had sent down a force sufficient to maintain order on the frontier, the British force would be retired. Some trouble arose soon afterwards on the arrival of a force of Abyssinians, which numbered some 4,000 men. Since that period the Government had heard of no-developments.EGYPT.The Labour Members of Parliament [B.E.R., lii, p. 3], On 21st and 23rd September, Mr. Scott&apos;telegraphed [Nos. 553 and 555] information regarding the visit of the four Labour members.He said that these members had been informed both verbally and in writing that their proposed visit to Tanta could not be permitted, as in the opinion of the responsible authorities it would be attended with grave risk to public order and security.   They were at the same time informed that, subject to the maintenance of
order and tranquillity, there was no desire to- place obstacles in the way of their acquiring full information.This course was taken in consequence of information having been received from various sources and confirmed, by the mudir of the Gharbia province that if Zagloul -Pasha and the Labour members were allowed to visit Tanta grave risk would be incurred.   There could be but little doubt that disturbances would follow demon-., strations, and that the disturbances would spread rapidly and only yield to armed force.Zagloul Pasha and his followers were making an occasion for a definite challenge to the existing Government, from which the permanent administrative machine-could-not be dissociated in the public mind. Success at Tanta would be followed by similar action in other places and control would soon cease throughout the country.Mr. Scott added that there had been no trouble in Cairo or Alexandria, this being , due largely to careful and unostentatious police precautions.   It would not be desirable or practicable to confine the Labour members to those two places, and it -was not proposed to interfere with their visits elsewhere more than seemed necessary to ensure the maintenance of order.MESOPOTAMIA.The Dasab-i-llqrlr Uperations.-On 17th and 22nd September the High Commissioner for Iraq telegraphed [NTos. 499 and 515] to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows : Under the direction of Major Marshal, situated in Dasat-i-Harir, operations were undertaken and successfully carried out as follows : A combined force, 200 levies and police, left Arbil on the 10th, and on the 12th, with the assistance of aeroplanes, occupied and burnt successfully Batas, Harir and Kharwatan. A quantity of property, including cattle and grain, was destroyed ; villages were gutted and the neighbouring crops fired. The attack was a complete surprise. In Batas the force was sniped and came under heavy fire from the hills near Kharwatan and Harir. Great coolness and gallantry was shown by the police and. the levies. The casualties were 3 men and 4 horses killed. The enemy casualties are estimated at 15 to 20. By the 16th hour the levies were safely withdrawn under cover of aeroplane co-operation, which was extremely effective and invaluable. To the north-west of Batas one machine crashed and was completely wrecked; the occupants were severely injured, but both were safely brought to Mosul by an aeroplane. The pilot succeeded in burning his machine. On the following clay Obaidullah, a rebel sheikh, sent a message asking Naib Mutessarif of Arbil to meet-him with a view to making submission. He is now ,;in Arbil and terms will probably bearranged to-day.At one point (? . . . .) the expedition nearly ended in disaster, the enemy being concealed in caves commanding the village. The position was saved by the gallantry of Mulazim than   Haidar and Onbashi Khornerad (?). The leading squadron had refused to advance to support the troops already in the village. This officer and non-commissioned officer not only led their own squadron forward, but collected and took with them the wavering first squadron and converted a probable disaster into victory. The leader of the first squadron is being court-martialled, and the circum-stance calls for an immediate reward (?) to this gallant officer and his non-commissioned officer. The General Officer commanding-in-Chief has kindly consented to decorate . the latter with the medal of the British. Empire, and T (?) venture to request that the &apos; facts may be placed before His Majesty the King with a recommendation for the immediate appointment of Mulazim than   HaidarTbn Harid (? Hamid) as member of the Order of British Empire.General Cox also said that he trusted it would be made clear in any communique on this subject that what we were dealing with was not a revolt in Iraq proper, but-Turkish armed aggression in the Kurdistan district.INDIA.. Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., lii, p. 4]. On 15th September the Viceroy transmitted [2195 S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs reporting the receipt of two letters from Tarsi.   No disclosure regarding the treaty with Russia was contained in either.   The
first letter was mainly directed to the,examination of Sir Henry&apos;s position as British representative, and stated that Afghanistan could only negotiate with His Majestys Government and not with the Government of India. The second letter inquired whether Great Britain was helping Greece. Sir Henry considered that it was clear that if a rupture in the negotiations with them took place, it was the intention of the Afghans to ascribe it to the Turkish question as the principal cause:A telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs dated 14th September stated that he had informed Tarsi according to his instructions that failing full disclosure he would leave on 19th September. He asked for further instructions regarding the presentation of a draft gentlemanly treaty as a last resort. To this the Viceroy had replied, that under the changed conditions due to the withdrawal of the Afghan discourteous letter, a gentlemanly treaty would be better than a rupture; Sir Henry was, therefore, empowered to offer it if he considered that the attitude of the Afghans, on finally withholding the disclosure, warranted him in doing so.A telegram transmitted [2201 S.] by the Viceroy on ICth September gave a full summary of the letters referred to above and Sir Henry&apos;s reply to the enquiry about assistance to Greece. The gist of this was that Great Britain and the Allies had made proposals to the Anatolian Turks and to the Greeks, which had been refused. Consequently they had declared absolute neutrality and had observed it. .Telegraphing [4802] on 19 th September the Secretary of State approved the&apos; authority given to Sir Henry Dobbs as reported in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 15th September.In a telegram repeated [2230 S.] by the Viceroy on 20th September Sir Henry Dqbbs reported that Tarsi had sent officials to him to say that he could give no more than verbal private assurance that the supplementary understanding (sic) with Russia was the same as had already been privately communicated. Tarsi had also written that the Russian embassy at Kabul denied that Krassin had communicated any supplementary clause to the British Government, and Tarsi affirmed that no supple-ment to the treaty with Russia, which was injurious to Great Britain, had been signed by Afghanistan. This Sir Henry considered as tantamount to a refusal to make any disclosure. Accordingly he had sent two members of the mission to explain to Tarsi that in view of this refusal he was prohibited from discussing a treaty providing for specially intimate relations, but had been authorized to propose a treaty providing for ordinary neighbourly relations. A draft of this had been sent, and Tarsi had shown himself in favour of the suggestion.A further telegram was transmitted [2236 S.] by the Viceroy on 21st September. In this Sir Henry reported the presentation of the neighbourly treaty at an official meeting with Tarsi, who had expressed his pleasure and relief at our willingness to continue negotiations. The Afghan decision in the matter was promised in. the course of three clays.Regarding the Afghan allusion to reported Greek&apos;excesses on Turkish territory, the Secretary of State telegraphed [4855] to the Viceroy on 21st September that this referred presumably to the mere presence of Greek troops in Asia Minor, and not to atrocities. Otherwise, Sir Henry Dobbs might point out that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. had impartially protested when the misbehaviour, of the troops of either belligerent had been brought to their notice. Apart from this, His Majesty&apos;s Government fully approved the reply already given by Sir Henry Dobbs.The Afghan Delegation [F.C.IL, 1, p. 2. and B.E.R., lii, p. 5].-The Secretary of State informed [No. 4818] the Viceroy on 19th September that the Afghan delegation had left London for Paris on 17th September, having made no further effort to establish relations with either the Foreign Office or the India Office.. On 21st September the Secretary of State notified [No. 4812] the Viceroy that the-following was being communicated to ReuteFs agency for publication : With reference to the departure for Paris on the 17th September, now reported, of the mission from the Amir of Afghanistan who have beeu for some weeks in this country, Reuter understands that the mission, headed by General Muhammad Wali Khan, arrived in England on 8th August and were received as the guests of His Majesty s Government. They stated that their object was to present a letter from the Amir to Iiis Majesty the King, announcing the appointment of the head of the
mission as Ambassador Extraordinary and Envoy Plenipotentiary, and a further letter from,the Afghan Foreign Minister to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Lord Curzon received the mission for the latter purpose, but explained that the political relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with Afghanistan were conducted by the Secretary of State for India, and that the acceptance of an envoy in London depended upon the conclusion of the treaty now being negotiated at Kabul. The Afghan delegation, however, persistently refused to enter into any relations with the India Office, whose desire to facilitate the objects of the mission was accordingly frustrated.The Viceroy&apos;a Report. -The following telegram was sent on 20th September :   Section 1. The most important events are the Moplah rising and the caliphate prosecutions. We have, kept you fully posted up with all the information on those. For the rest, the action taken in regard to high, prices seems to have had a satisfactory result. The prices are still high, but they are not rising; and the decision to stop export has been beneficial. Other parts of the Madras presidency have been affected.Section 2. The political situation in the Gbdavari, Kistna and Guntur is dis-quieting, and respect for constituted authority has undoubtedly been impaired. It is hoped tliat. movable columns will shortly march through these districts. The currency chest has been removed from Guntur. The military have been despatched to Bezwada. In the Godavari district the conference resolved in favour of civil disobedience ; a similar resolution moved in Guntur was vetoed, and is to be reconsidered.Section 3. In Kistna, a riot has been reported from Pentapad, in which the police had to fire, killing one and wounding two. One constable was seriously injured. In Madras itself the labour disputes, which have been dragging on for the last few months, have led to definite outbreaks of caste warfare between Hindus and Muslims on the one hand and the Adi Dravidas on the other.Section 4. The Government of Madras are anxious that the number of troops allotted to the Madras district should be materially increased. We are considering this question.From Bengal we have a reassuring report that people in general seem, less interested than they were in political agitation. Some zamindars are definitely opposed to the non-cooperation movement, and a few cases are reported in which adherents of the non-co-operation movement, embittered by their treatment at the hands of the leaders, have given it up and rendered useful help in opposing it. The success of several prosecutions has damaged the ardour of stump orators. Jute absorbs the attention of the cultivators and middlemen in East Bengal, and the economic impracticability of the charka campaign has been generally recognized. Oon-centration on the boycott of foreign cloth has diverted attention from other aspects of the non-co-operation movement. The boycott generally is not making much headway in Bengal. gandhis visit gave it a fillip in Calcutta, and imports ,are seriously affected, at any. rate temporarily.Section 5. Gandhi interviewed the Marwaris, but was unable to meet their proposals,, or accede to Andrews&apos; protest against the useless burning of cloth when thousands of Indian coolies were insufficiently clad. Gandhi maintains the economic fallacy that destruction is the quickest method of stimulating production. The United Provinces report that the Am an Sabhas continue to do good work, and that one Sabha has broken new ground by giving organized assistance at a mela in the Gonda district, where cholera threatened trouble. Delhi reports a lull in political excitement. Action has been taken against the stump orators under section 14-4, Criminal Procedure Code. The security of Rs. 2,000 deposited by the Fateh, a vernacular newspaper, in June last, has been forfeited.   Muharram has been quiet..Section 6.. Pussyfoot Johnsons meeting passed off harmoniously, but his visit on the whole was a disappointment to genuine advocates of temperance, who disliked his manner, and to the non-Co-operators, especially when hopes of finding: him an ally were disappointed.Section 7. The municipal committee has unanimously resolved to welcome the Prince of Wales, and has voted funds for the purpose.Section 8. We are not yet in a position to estimate the effect of the prosecution and arrest of the caliphate leaders as the announcement has only just been made, but32-5 B
(jit is possible there may be sporadic disturbances. All possible precautions have, however, been taken.   The situation generally is delicate, and is being watched withthe utmost vigilance.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.New Cabinet. On 22nd September the Governor-General reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that on the previous day he had sworn in the following as members of. the King&apos;s Privy Council of Canada; Louis de Gonzague Belley, John Babington Macaulay Baxter, John Wesley Edwards, Louis Philippe Normand, flenry Pferbert Stevens, &quot;Rodolphe Monty, Robert James Manion, John Alexander Stewart, Edmund Bristol, James R. Wilson, Richard B. Bennett.He also reported that the following was the. personnel of the reorganized Cabinet: Arthur Meighen    - -   Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs.J. A.

Spinney;     - - ASir Edward Hemp - - f w-^     tfolioJames Wnson       - - vEdmund Bristol -JRelations with the United States.-On 29th August the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General as follows : -- A United States Embassy representative called at the Foreign Office recently in connexion with the export of pulp-wood from Canada to the United States. It appears that the President of the United States is now proceeding to appoint a committee, in pursuance of an Act of Congress, presumably identical with or similar to the resolution which was before Congress early in 1920, for the purpose of negotiating with the Canadian and the provincial Governments with a view to the removal of certain -existing restrictions . on the exportation of pulp-wood from Canada, and. that the United -States Embassy had been instructed to ascertain whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would have any objection to the Initiation of direct negotiations on the lines proposed. The matter is, of course, one on which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be guided by the wishes of your Ministers. Please telegraph their views as soon as possible.On 20th September the Governor-General replied to this as follows: The resolution, is stibstantially identical with the resolution passed last year by both Houses of Congress, to which President Wilson declined to give his signature and which accordingly fell under what is known as the &quot; pocket veto &quot; along with some other measures. At the time, but before&apos; the resolution had reached the President, the Canadian Government had communicated their views fully to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington in secret despatch No. 57 of 3rd June 1920, andsthey understood that representations to the United States Government had been made
accordingly. This despatch concluded as follows : The adoption of the (?) Underwood resolution would be deeply regretted by the Canadian Government. At the&apos; beginning of 1911 the present Governments predecessors in power were unable to accede to the same demand, and the conviction that the decision must be maintained has been strengthened by reconsideration during the succeeding year. The manner in which the provinces may regulate the use of Crown property is not a suitable subject for international.negotiations. Timber regulations represent a valuable and important feature of Canadian domestic policy and in no sense are they arbitrary or (group omitted) in any view of international economic relations.ddie language and implications of section 2 of the resolution would be still more objectionable. They could only be taken as conveying the threat of some action directed against Canada and designed to force an alteration in Canadian domestic regulations that involve no feature of discrimination whatever either in (?) form or in effect against the United States.Such an affront would be unprecedented in the history of the relations between the United States and Canada, and would be calculated to produce a deplorable effect upon the existing good feeling between the people of the two countries. The Canadian Government cannot believe that in these circumstances the resolution will be &quot;permitted to become a formal public act.It may be explained here that the regulations cannot be accurately described as-restrictions upon the export of pulp-wood. The provinces have no jurisdiction over exports. The provinces rather, in selling their yearly contracts of licence permitting, the cutting of pulp-wood on the provincial Crown lands, simply impose a condition to the effect that the wood so cut must be manufactured at least to the stage of pulp in Canada; otherwise the licences become void. As compared either with all other foreign countries, or indeed with other parts of the British Empire, there is no discrimination whatever against the United States.The Canadian Government still hold the view set out in the despatch above cited, and therefore on the grounds and in the circumstances thus indicated, and apart from other considerations, would decline to receive or to treat with a commission; instituted under the resolution.Certain other considerations, however, involve points of form and procedure, and&apos; may possibly be invoked to facilitate an amicable adjustment of the matter. It seems not unlikely that, knowing the restrictive regulations in cpiestion were the act of certain of the provinces, and realizing the impossibility of securing direct access to the provincial Governments through a diplomatic channel, the proponents of the resolution conceived that such access might be secured through this device of a special mission.The Canadian Government, being responsible for the conduct of the external relations of the Dominion, could not, however, tfbnsent to such a foreign mission treating with the provinces. In view of their analogous relation to the several states of the union the United States Government will readily appreciate this point..So far as negotiation with the Dominion Government is concerned, the resolution raises a separate point of procedure ; for my advisers would regard it as quite unnecessary and inappropriate that such a matter should be approached and dealt with through the medium of a special mission, even if the proposal were tree from the objectionable features indicated in the despatch above quoted. The ordinary diplo-matic channel, i.e., communication from the United States.Secretary of State through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington to the Canadian Government, is always open for such representations as they may care to make on any Canadian matter in which the United States Government conceive themselves properly interested. It should be noted that the United States department have never made any representation to the Canadian Government protesting against the regulations in question or challenging their propriety in any way from the point of view of international relations a circumstance which would render a special mission still more incongruous. There was indeed reason to believe last year that the State Department considered they had no valid grounds of complaint against, the provincial regulations, and therefore regarded the resolution as improper. Though the present administration in Washington is said to be to some extent pledged in this matter, it is con--ceivable that the President and the Secretary of State may not be unwilling to find in the above considerations grounds of political expediency from their point of view for omitting to appoint a commission, and thus for avoiding an &quot;unpleasant incident. There is now a further feature of this matter which 32-5 C
doubtless has a significant implication iii connexion with the general attitude towards the Dominions of the British Empire of the present administration in Washington. Though the question is of a purely Canadian character, and. though, such questions have for years been dealt with, Els a matter of course, direct between Washington and Ottawa through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, they have seen fit to broach the question through their embassy in London. The obvious inconveniences and delays inherent in this roundabout method, apart from other considerations, have long since been recognized on all hands as rendering it undesirable. My advisers think that the reply that should be returned to the United States Embassy should in effect be to refer the United States Government to Ottawa. They would then deal-with the matter along the lines indicated. They would have no objection to the Foreign Secretary intimating to the United States Ambassador, to such extent and in such manuer as he thinks best, any of the various points set forth herein, if be considers the adjustment of this particular matter would be facilitated by such a course. At the same time they are anxious that no encouragement should be given to what is apparently an attempt to depart from well-established custom that has long been followed in dealing with Canadian-American affairs, and that has proved its worth both as a convenience and as a guarantee of good understanding between the two countries. They would be glad, therefore, if His Majesty&apos;s Government would take occasion also to suggest to the United States Government&apos; that in future such questions should be taken up with the Canadian Government direct through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington.AUSTRALIA.The following items of information were received by the Acting High Com-missioner in London from the Prime. MinisteFs Department, Melbourne, on (?) 17thSeptember:  .Repatriation Loan. The Federal Government^ 10,000,0001 sterling loan for the further repatriation of soldiers has been fully subscribed, though investments have not been made with the same spontaneity that characterized the much larger loans during war-time. The public showed full agreement with the Common wealth&apos;s fixed policy to discharge all its obligation to the diggers. All of the loan will be spent on returned soldiers&apos; interests. Much of the expenditure will be reproductive. Satis-faction is expressed that the soldier settlers are meeting their obligations with admirable completeness.Good Season.  Springtime ^conditions justify an optimistic outlook. The dairying season has opened rerrfarkably well. Lambing returns were consistently high, and the pasturage and wheat, areas are in excellent condition. Rains and melting snow have caused floods in Victoria, but the damage is not extensive. Any local material loss is balanced by the general gain to the land. The wool industry is more buoyant with good prospects of a steady market. The&apos; meat industry is depressed; this is largely due to the effect of high overseas freightage,German Bid for Trade. Commercial houses report that German traders are making a keen effort to secure business. Their offers are temptingly low, some quotations being one-fourth of the prices at which British and Australian made goods are now being retailed in Sydney and Melbourne. One effect of the German circulars is the hardening of the demand for drastic anti-dumping legislation.Cotton Growing in Queensland. Cotton growing in Queensland is making rapid progress. The demand for seed this year greatly exceeds all former records. Over 12,000 applications for seed have been received, which means that 14,000 acres will be under crop as against 1,500 last year.NEW ZEALAND.Opening of Parliament. On 22nd September the Governor-General reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that Parliament had been opened by him that day.
SOUTH AFRICA.Labour Victories. ReuteFs Capetown agent reported on 8th September that the Government had lost to Labour two constituencies previously held by the South African, party.   And next clay he telegraphed in regard to this as follows : The overwhelming nature of the Labour victory in the parliamentary bye-elections at Gardens and Liesbeek has come as a surprise to the greater part of the country although it was certain -that Labour would make headway.Mr. Boydell, the leader of the Labour party in the House of Assembly, had organized the campaign at Gardens and Liesbeek since,the close of Parliament, and the Labour successes are attributed to the efficiency of his organization and the willingness of the voluntary workers who assisted him,&apos; as well as to the fact, that while wages had been reduced and people had retrenched there has been no corre-sponding decrease in the cost of living.The leading South African newspapers attribute the turnover of votes to the economic distress, for which the Government, they declare, has been made the scapegoat.The Cape Times says that the electors would be puzzled to explain what they hope to gain by their decision, since neither of the Labour candidates offered a practicable alternative to the Governments policy.Ex-Enemy Mining Shares.-On 14th September ReuteFs Capetown agent reported that Sir Hamilton Fowle, custodian of enemy property, was shortly proceeding to London in connexion with the disposal of ex-enemy mining shares. It was under-stood that due regard would be paid in the disposal to the fact that in present circumstances the market could not rapidly absorb large blocks of shares.
