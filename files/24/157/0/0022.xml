GREAT BRITAIN.The Labour Situation. The following paragraph is taken from the report on. unemployment for the week ending 20th January, issued by the Ministry of Labour: There are as yet no general signs of trade revival. On the whole the improve-ment in coal-mining continues, though there have been set-backs in certain areas. A slight improvement is recorded in the iron and steel industry. Shipbuilding and marine engineering show nq improvement, but a slight improvement in ship-repairing is reported from Bristol. The improvement in the woollen industry is maintained: The hosiery trade is fairly brisk. Cotton, however, remains very uncertain. General engineering is still depressed, though a slight recovery in the motor and cycle sections continues, and a few re-engagements in other sections have been reported. Employment in the tin-plate industry remains good. The improve-ment in the wholesale clothing industry has not been maintained. The building trade remains stagnant. There is a distinct improvement in the glove-making industry at Barnstaple.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.The Situation. A summary of the situation was issued to the press for publi-cation on 30th January, and it was announced that the High Commissioner&apos; had been summoned to England to give full information and advice to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-nient. This summary was telegraphed [No. 33] on 28th January to Lord Allenby who was requested to cause it to be published simultaneously in Egypt.. On, 29,th. January, in reply to the instructions [No. 32] requiring his return to England to acquaint the Government with his &apos;views, Lord Allenby telegraphed &apos; [No. 41] that he was leaving forthwith and was-due in London on 8th February, and was bringing General Clayton and Mr. Amos with him.  ,&quot;TheWafd [B.E.R., lxi,p. 2].-Telegraphing [No. 28] on 23rd January, Lord Allenby reported that the Wafd, excepting dissentient members, had published a manifesto that evening calling upon all Egyptians to refuse to co-operate in any way with the English, and to boycott all British goods, commerce, &amp;c. The manifesto was couched in vehement terms, and was a direct challenge to his authority. He had ordered the suspension of all newspapers which had published it, and was preventing its publication in the remainder.He had ordered the arrest of the signatories, who were as foUows : Hamad El Basel,, Wissa Wasif, Ali Maher, George Khayat, Wasif Ghali, Morcos Hanna, Elwi El Gazzar, Murad El Shared.   The last three were newly-elected members.ReuteFs agent was telegraphing the full text of the manifesto to London.In reference to the foregoing Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 40] on 28th January as follows.:-Yesterday morning I summoned Hamad Pasha, El Basel, Morcos Bey Hanna and Ali Bey Maher. I told them that I was going to release them from detention, and cautioned them to abstain from further action against my authority in Egypt. I informed them that while 1 had no wish to interfere with individual liberty of political opinion, I would not allow active opposition by a self-constituted political body.The remaining five internees wrere cautioned on similar lines by my oriental . secretary.   I ordered the release of all eight persons at 5 o&apos;clock.   The press has been instructed not to. publish anything over the signatures of any of the eight persons released.
INDIA.- The Viceroy&apos;s Report. The following telegram was sent on 26th January :-lieifgal. Fewer arrests have been, necessary in Calcutta lately. Practically.all arrests how made are under the Police Act for ordinary offences, obstruction and so forth. Non-co-operators have increasing difficulty in finding recruits, but the movement continues to be pushed by activities of ladies which are creating a difficult situation. In Mofussil extremist propaganda continues to be active and widespread. The situation caused most anxiety in (? Pangpur), Noakhali and (? Fatehpur), where it is doubtful whether the leaders of the movement have any real control. Agitation &apos; in rural areas continues to be directed mainly against the village chankidars, pay(ment of) chaukidari and union rates, and the weapons of social and commercial boycott&quot; are being used to an increasing extent. The Government have continued the policy of clemency towards minor offenders, under section 17 (2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. There have been large numbers of releases and of reductions in sentences. Generally speaking, the firm attitude of the Government has checked the rush towards anarchy, but the attempt to discredit law and order by the use of every weapon continues, and there is a strong undercurrent of disorderly elements, mainly mohamedans, which is steadily carrying the whole mass towards violence.United Provinces. The fortnight has been one of expectancy. Parades of volunteers occurred in places, and enrolment continues briskly in preparation for whatever orders may be received. The more serious side of the unrest focussed itself at Bara Banki, Hardoi and North Oudh. In Bara Banki noisy and disorderly demonstrations occurred from the 7th to the 10th; the magistrate and the police were foully abused by large crowds, and public buildings were surrounded. The situation was handled with tact and patience, and the police were adequately strengthened and the position is now cpiiet. Similar doings occurred at Hardoi on a smallei scale. In both places, and in Partabgarh the demonstrators arrived in large numbers from the villages.Section 3. Unrest connected with the agrarian (? riots) has been manifested in the north; otherwise the view generally held by local officers regarding the Criminal Law Amendment Act is that the situation can be kept in hand so long as this Act is not withdrawn, but that withdrawal would make things impossible. Police resigna-tions uow total 1-10, being about four per thousand of strength. A forecast of the future is impossible, but events like those of Bara Banki and Hardoi, joined to unrest (? and the; violence which has broken out in Bahraich, cannot repeat themselves simultaneously in numerous areas without the gravest risk of a conflagration.Punjab.-Agitators have been devoting much attention to the prohibited volunteer organizations. The so-called, volunteers are frequently men of low class or mere boys, and demonstrations by them have ceased as soon as it became clear that they would be ignored. In some cases it has been necessary for the police to disperse crowds and make arrests. Political meetings are being held at the rate of about 100 a week. There has been no diminution in the violence of language used, (&apos;? and)&apos;(? omission) is slowly but surely spreading to the rural areas, particularly among the Sikhs in the Jullundur district. The situation among the Sikhs of the rural tracts has become definitely and seriously worse&apos;during the fortnight. For the first time there has been an indication of difficulty in obtaining recruits. Among the Jath Sikhs the akali movement, is gaining ground in the villages. It has become imperative for the Government to bring back the simple-minded non-political majority of the Panth to reason. The movement, however, for the separation of politics from religion in the affairs of the shiromani gurdwara prabandhak committee continues to be promising; and the situation among the Sikhs may be substantially affected by the announcement made of the intention of the Government to acquiesce in the control of the Darbar Sahib of Amritsar and its connected shrines by the committee, and the release, of all Sikh prisoners who were convicted for. attending meetings in which the affairs of these shrines were discussed. The effect of Government action may, it is hoped, be to reconcile moderate Sikh opinion ; extremist Sikh (&apos;? &quot; opinion &quot; omitted) will, however, remain irreconcilable, and danger may arise again from the question of other Sikh shrines, which is complicated by non Sikh interests, though moderate sympathisers have been in a marked degree alienated by the measures entailed by the proclamation of volunteers. There is also a growing realization of the clangers of disorder, and some indication of a rally to Government 37-1    .&apos; A 2
as the defender of order. The barometer of rural, opinion (?&quot; on &quot; omitted) the payment of the land revenue continues very favourable.Section 4,   Except in regard to the volunteer movement, there are still -no-;actual instances of civil disobedience.   The editor and publisher oi the Bande Alataram is 1 being prosecuted for the publication of incitements to civil disobedience, and securities 1 of the presses&apos; at which the Pratap. aud theKesari were printed have been forfeited..Section 5.   Bihar aud Ofissa. Except in Tirhoot, there has been during, the past ;l fortnight a lull in non-co-operation activity.   In the Muzaftarpur district it.,1ms. been &quot;necessary to post a force of DO additional armed police to the Sitamarhi thana, ,&apos;.aiid large niobs are reported to be moving daily in Mahua Para, Lalganj Pattipur an,d other than as.    &quot;     . &apos;   &apos;    &apos;     &apos; ,      ,,  ..Section Qi At Hajipur a crowd paraded in front of the police station and grossly abused the police ; and similar reports have been received from other police [stations in districts, . &apos; &apos;&apos;Section 7. &apos;A squadron of 11th-12th Cavalry is still in the district, and. a company &apos;;of the .5th (? Northumberland) Fusiliers has gone to Muzaffarpur for winter Training. &apos;Half a squadron of cavalry is now engaged in (corrupt group) (? a portion of) the Sitaniarhi sub-division, and this, arid the presence of the additional armed.,police, -will have a restraining effect on the more violent adherents of the non-co-operation . movement, and a reassuring influence on the moderate loyal element. The question &apos;of declaring any police station which is invaded a disturbed, area under the/Police &apos; Act, and providing a force of armed police at the cost of the neighbourhood, is &apos; under consideration. In the rest of the province the political atmosphere is -clearer. vIn the coalfields all is quiet. &apos; - :]Bombay. In&apos;Bombay the volunteer movement does not appear to be. having &apos; much success. An intensive campaign for massing civil disobedience is. being &quot;concent-rated more arid more in Bardoli Taluk, Surat district; where it is reported that &apos;two whole villages have signed a pledge not&apos;to-pay the land revenues. &apos;,). -: &apos; Section 8. The report of the representative1 conference at Bombay, shows that Mrs. BesanPs section aud the Bombay moderates did not attend ; only 20 out of 200 Representatives voted for the resolutions ; the rest deliberately abstained.  . ,,Section 9. A forecast of the present situation continues to be.one of,[waiting &apos;events, while.non-co-operators are engaged in preparatory measures. This, phase is likely to be maintained for a week or two.   ; &apos;     . ,.-&apos;.&apos;. &apos;,f.&apos;.,, .&apos;,,!&apos; Madras&apos;.-It lias not yet been found.&apos;necessary&apos;fo declare any associations unlawful under Act Ti- of 1908. There have been a large number of cases of disobedience &apos;under section 144. Reports of further resignations among village officers continue to be. received, but uot in large numbers. Determined efforts-are being made to. under-mihethe discipline of the Madras citizen police; nigher rates of pay are being demanded, aud are understood to include a minimum pay of Rs. o.O a month,for constable. It is not certain, hoivever, that there will be a strike. &apos; &apos; Central Provinces.-The lull in political activity continues. Attempts have.been made to put the existing, volunteer corps on a better footing, but so far no objection-able developments have been reported. Boycott of the visit of the Prince of Wales is being vigorously preached, but the effect of the propaganda is at present, doubtful. In rural areas touring officers continue to report a marked decrease in manifestations of non-co-operation. . .[.[&apos; Assam. Position in the Assam valley has deteriorated during the fortnight. &quot;Generally, there: has been, a cessation of meetings and demonstrations in the towns, but intensification of propaganda work in the villages. .The swaraj programme placed before the villagers in Kamrup includes, the abolition of all taxes except the land revenue, which is to be reduced by 75 per cent. The excise revenue has already been greatly diminished, and there is also certain to be a difficulty&apos;in collecting the land revenue. Instructions have been issued that coercive measures are to be adopted promptly, and a special Bill, providing imprison-ment for contumacious refusal to pay arrears of the land revenue, is being prepared in .case it is required. The report from more than one district is that word has just been passed round that non-payment of the land revenue is not at present to be included in the programme, if, however, there is a definite refusal to pay, it is more &apos;than likely that enforcement of coercive measures will give rise to disturbances which will have to be put down by force. Determined assaults are made on loyal (? Govern-ment) servants, and supporters of the Government, by insult and boycott, The result, in resignations, has not been considerable up to date. Everything is quiet in Sylhet and no serious developments there are likely in the immediate future.
North-West Frontier. The political&apos;situation continues to he satisfactory: Banna - The internees have now been released.   Apart from the leaders, some&quot; 05 of the rank and file were removed from Rangoon to Mandalay for&apos; the&apos;period of the PrinceV visit; they are now returning and iecrudesoerice of the agitation may. therefore be expected.   Apart from the virulence of the press, the most serious feature in the situation is the violence of the. younger monks.   Several have been dealt with under section 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.   In Rangoon, on 10th January, a body of young monks endeavoured to create trouble at a pagoda&apos; because a troupe of dancers performing there had performed before the Prince.&apos; Police protection was asked for and on the 11th there was a slight -fracas between police and monks.   This conduct is repudiated by the older monks, and by right-thinking Burrnans, but the action which it is necessary to take against younger monks lends itself very easily to misrepresentation, which is likely to stir up the masses.   No associations have been declared unlawful, up to date, under Act 14 of 1908.   Only one prosecution has been instituted under the Seditious Meetings Act.   At the present moment, only three persons are in jail for political offences.   Indians in Burma are. ^extraordinarily quiet.   The labour situation is very peaceful.THE DOMINIONS.1 Pbwen nnd Children Gonventioit.-On 21st January the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada,. Australia, New Zealand and South Africa : His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to advise His Majesty to ratify the Women and Children Convention signed by the second assembly of the League of Nations. Do your Ministers desire that the convention should be ratified on their behalf ?  .To this the following replies have been received :  (I) Australia, 28th January. The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia desire ratification on their behalf subject to the reservation made by the signatory for Australia.(2) New Zealand, 28th January. The Government of New Zealand agrees, to the Women and Children Convention being ratified on their behalf.Advisory Committee on Civil Aviation [.B.E.R,, lxi, p. 6J. The following replies have been received: (1) Canada, 23rd January. The Civil Aviation Air Board concur in the suggestion, though at the present moment it is not possible to nominate a Canadian representative resident in Great Britain. Later on it is not unlikely that questions will arise affecting the relations between Canada and the United States, and their importance may render it advisable for the. Air Board to send from Canada to participate in them an official conversant with local conditions. The Air Board request that if there is no objection the proceedings of the Civil. Aviation Advisory Board may be communicated to the Government of Canada. m(2) Australia, 1st February. The Civil Aviation Advisory Board of theGovern-ment of the Commonwealth, of Australia nominates &apos;Squadron Leader E. Harrison, official representative in London of the Australian Air Service, to represent Australia.(3) South Africa, 25th January.   My Ministers concur in the Air Councils views, and state that. the Union High Commissioner in London will represent the &apos; Union of South Africa should occasion arise for consultation with representatives of the self-governing Dominions.(4) Newfoundland, 3 fst January. My Ministers nominate the High Commissioner, -or, as an alternative, the Secretary to the High Commissioner.Position of British Indians in the Empire. On 19th January the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed as follows to the Governors-General of Canada, New Zealand, and Australia : It was suggested, informally, in connexion with the resolution on the position of British Indians in the Empire, passed at the conference of Prime Ministers and representatives of India, held in London last summer, that a deputation from India should visit Canada, L\ew Zealand, and Australia as soon as possible after the conference. In view of the favourable reception given to the suggestion, the Secretary of State for India has been discussing tentatively with the Government of
(jIndia the personnel of the deputation, the approximate date of departure, and the-probable itinerary. It is contemplated that the principal member ot the deputation should be Mr. Sastri, whose appointment as delegate at Washington has prevented earlier arrangements, and anticipated that the deputation coukf be ready to leave-India about the end of April, visiting Australia and New Zealand, and then Canada.. The Secretary of State for India explains that the Government of India have been encouraged to proceed thus far by the cordial welcome extended to the proposal when-first made in London, but before further arrangements are made, he would be glad to learn definitely that it would be agreeable to your Ministers to receive such a deputation.   Please telegraph reply.AUSTRALIA.27;e Dried Fruit Industry and Immigration. The following message from the Prime Minister was transmitted by the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 28th J anuary : --The Prime Minister and Ministers of the Commonwealth, and the Premiers of the-several States of the Commonwealth meeting in conference to discuss matters of great national importance, have considered the fruit-growing industry in its relation to the settlement on the lands of Australia of suitable British emigrants, preferably ex-service men and their families. The possibilities of fruits suitable for drying, such as currants, raisins, muscatels, prunes, apricots, peaches, &amp;c, are almost unlimited, and there is a market in Britain more than ample to absorb the output of many thousands, of new settlers in addition to those already on the lands.The proposition is one that it is thought will commend itself to the British Government. It involves close settlement on irrigated areas, Markets are, however, essential.The great economic importance of the industry to the Empire, and its direct bearing on the settlement of British ex-soldiers - many of whom have found and are-finding employment in connexion therewith is obvious. The significance and value of effective migration must at this juncture be apparent to the British Government. On behalf of the Commonwealth and State Governments, therefore, I desire to urge the British Government to co-operate with them in assisting the Australian dried fruit industry. Assistance could best be granted by a preferential tariff in favour of Australian dried fruits of lid per lb. on currants, and 2d. per lb. on raisins and all other dried fruits.Double Income Tax. With the passing of a Bill recently by the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia, the elimination of double taxation of income as between Australia and the United Kingdom has now been achieved.Iu a statement to the press on 1st February the High Commissioner, Sir Joseph Cook, said : &quot; I am glad that the double impost has been at last destroyed. It never could be defended and has been finally relegated to the limbo of worn-out and forgotten things. In my last budget I promised to complete speedily the arrange-ments made between the Imperial Treasury and ourselves. Since I left Australia Mr. Hughes has put the necessary Bill through, adopting the scheme recommended by the sub-committee of the British Boyal Commission on Income Tax.&quot; Broadly speaking, the effect of the arrangement is that where the British tax is greater than the Common wealth and State taxes combined, the taxpayer will pay in. the aggregate only the British rate, but where the combined Australian rates exceed the British rate he will pay only at the combined Australian rates. The higher rate-will always be charged and the lower tax will be rebated. There will be no adjust-ment. between the Governments, the whole matter being arranged by the taxing commissioners. The assessment in the case of the United Kingdom will take note of the liability to taxation under the Australian laws, and, in the case of the Common-wealth, of the liability to taxation under the British law, and the rate of tax wdll be fixed accordingly.&quot; The actual provisions of the Act are that, in the case where the amount of income is liable to taxation by the Commonwealth, and British Governments, or by a State Government as well, and the Commonwealth rate or the sum of the Common-wealth and State rates is greater than one-half of the British rate, the extent of rebate allowable is (a) where tire Australian rate is greater than the British rate  rebate of one-half of the British rate ; and (6) where the Australian rate is not greater than the British rate, rebate of the excess of the Australian rate over one-half of the British rate.&quot;
