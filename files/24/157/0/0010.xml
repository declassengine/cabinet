At the thirty-third meeting held, on 2nd August, the Prime Minister was asked by the members of the Conference to present the following humble address to His Majesty the King: &quot; We, the Prime Ministers and other Representatives of the British Empire, sneaking on behalf of the United Kingdom, the. British Dominions, the Indian Empire and the British Crown Colonies and Protectorates, desire, on the eve of concluding our meeting, to present our humble duty to your Majesty, and to reaffirm our loyal devotion to your Throne. We have been conscious throughout our deliberations of a unanimous conviction that the most essential of the links that bind our widely-spread peoples is the Crown, and it is our determination that no changes in our status as peoples or as Governments shall Aveaken our common allegiance to the Empire and its Sovereign.-&quot;Knowing your Majesty&apos;s deep interest in all that touches your people&apos;s happiness, we trust that our labours in this time of world-wide unrest may be satls-factory to you and conduce to the welfare and safety of your dominions as well as to the peace of the Avorld.&quot; We pray that your Majesty and the Queen may long be spared to enjoy the affection of your subjects and to see all classes equally recovered from the strain and sacrifice of the war.&quot;His Majesty1 e Reply. To this address His Majesty was pleased to send the following reply: &quot;It is with much satisfaction that I have received from the Members of the Imperial Conference on the close of their labours an Address assuring me of their loyal devotion to myself and to the Throne.&quot;Still more am I gratified by their expressed conviction that the Crown is the important link uniting together in cohesion and strength the component parts of our great Empire.&quot;I have experienced stirring and ineffaceable proofs of these sentiments in the enthusiastic and touching receptions invariably given me on the several occasions of my visits to different portions of the world where the British flag flies proofs Avhich have been renewed in the remarkable demonstrations of welcome and goodwill towards the Prince of Wales in those Dominions and Colonies which he has been able to visit during the past three years.&quot; Furthermore, Avhere could one find such ample testimony to their common allegiance to the Empire and its Sovereign than in their noble self-sacrifice during four and a half years of the World War ?&quot; I have followed with keen interest the deliberations of the Conference. These meetings, and the exchange of views between the Ministers of the great communities which they represent, upon the many problems affecting the common interest of the British peoples, are essential to the unity and well-being of the Empire, and to the general peace of the world.&quot; Every facility must be given for such periodical meetings, and to ensure this avo look confidently to the men of science and research to discover improved means of inter-communication between all parts of the British Commonwealth.
&quot; I know that the work of the Conference has been strenuous, entailing severe demands, mental and physical, upon all concerned. But their time has been well spent in advancing further along the road of progress and development, I heartily thank them on my own behalf and that of The Queen for their Address. We wish God-speed to those who are leaving England, and a safe and happy return to their respective homes and families. More than ever do we follow with feelings of affection the welfare of our people at home and across the sea.&quot;.10th August 1921. (Signed)  GEORGE R.I.GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 9th August :-Survey of the Labour Situation. A general absence of notable events con-tinues to be the predominant feature of the labour situation. The shipyard joiners&apos; dispute is still the one trade dispute of considerable magnitude in progress, while the steady decrease in recent weeks of the number of workers unemployed, as shown by the live register totals, continues. The increase, however, which followed the coal dispute has not yet disappeared. The estimated total of the live register of all Employment Exchanges on the 5th. August was 1,738,300. This figure may be compared with 1,686,900, the corresponding figure for the 15th April at the end of the second week of the coal dispute.On the other hand, there is a considerable stir of minor movements, none of which at the moment are very prominently in the public eye. In the strictly industrial sphere, the wages reduction movement proceeds in a somewhat underground and exceedingly complex fashion. The tendency towards disintegration, which was noticed last week, is observable this week also with the printing trade unions. Agricultural workers and Irish railwaymen are affected by legislation in progress or in prospect. No general results are yet discernible from the challenge the Labour Joint Committee of Inquiry have offered as regards the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number.The extent to which the coal dispute still dominates the labour situation is shown by the attention which, it appears, will be paid at the annual meetings of the Miners&apos; -Federation of Great Britain and the Trades Union Congress to the working of trade union machinery at the time of crisis. Two projects on the part of trades unionists to break away from the wages system through the avenue of productive co-operation are reported, and are of interest as evidence of the reaction upon the workers of present industrial movements.Trades Union Congress. The annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress opens at Cardiff on the 5th September. In accordance with the decisions of last .year&apos;s congress, a General Council will be elected on a group basis, in place of the Parliamentary Committee, and will have power to promote common action by the whole trade union movement on general questions, such as wages and hours of labour.The agenda for the conference includes a discussion, on the initiative of the Building Trade Workers&apos; Union, on the &quot; apparent breakdown of the Triple Alliance in connexion with the miners&apos; dispute.&quot; This same dispute has, apparently, led also -to an important resolution standing in the name of the Iron and Steel Trades Con-federation, which instructs the General Council to give attention to the consequences resulting from industrial strikes carried out on the present lines. It declares that, these results make it imperative that adequate machinery should be provided through the Trades Union Congress so that, in the event of any serious dispute being likely to lead to a stoppage of work on a large scale, the power and influence of the labour movement may be brought to bear to obtain an equitable settlement of the dispute without stoppage o  work, and, failing such a settlement, to guarantee that the machinery and resources of the movement generally may be co-ordinated and applied in such a way as to ensure a successful issue.
COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;e.KENYA COLONY.The Indian Question [B.E.R., xliv, p. S]. On 5th August ReuteFs agent sent &quot;the following messages from Nairobi: Following a number of meetings of settlers held in the country districts to discuss the Indian question, a mass meeting of Europeans was held here yesterday at which a series of resolutions, directed against the claims of the Indians in the-colony to equality with the whites, was unanimously adopted. The speakers included unofficial members of the Legislative Council, representatives of the medical profession and the farmers, Bishop Hay wood and Canon Burns.The Indian situation has reached a very acute stage, and it is understood that a secret organization has been completed by the settlers with the object of resisting the Indian claims by every means,A meeting was held at Thika recently at which Kinyanjui, Paramount Chief of the Wakikuyu, repudiated the resolutions adopted at a recent meeting of natives making common cause with the Indians and declared himself opposed to the Indians.A meeting of the Legislative Council has suddenly been called for 9th August-It is to be held in camera.. The object of the meeting, it is believed, is to discuss emergency legislation dealing with the Indian question.RHODESIA.The Bliodesian Delegation. The following information was sent by ReuteFs. agent from Salisbury on 9th August: The Rhodesian Constitutional delegation, consisting of Messrs. Coghlan, McChlery, Leggate and Fletcher, members of the Legislative Council, aud Sir Francis Newton, will sail on 9th September, after inter-viewing General Smuts.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., xlix, p. 3]. The Viceroy telegraphed [1394] on 3rd August that communications had been interrupted, with a consequent decrease in hostilities, by heavy rains in Waziristan.In a further telegram [1446], dated 10th August, the Viceroy reported that the abnormal rainfall had caused extensive damage to railways, bridges, and roads in Waziristan, Tochi, and Kohat, which it would take many months to repair. Communication had been kept up by wireless.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., xlix; p. 3], In continuance of the correspondence on the-subject of the proposed treaty with Afghanistan, the Viceroy transmitted [1828 S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs on 28th -July. In this, the latter reported a great change for the worse in the Afghan attitude towards the mission since the arrival of M. Roskolnikov and the opening of the Anatolian campaign. Among signs of the change was a distinct decrease of courtesy paid to Sir Henry. Apparently from, the-reception given to the1 Russian Ministers, a treaty with Russia had actually been ratified, but in any case it had been intended to make it clear that Afghanistan would not give up the Russian alliance. The AimYs indisposition had delayed a meeting of the Cabinet, but Sir Henry expected no satisfactory communication from Tarsi. He asked for prompt and definite instructions regarding the pis aller policy in case of the Afghans giving a final refusal of the exclusive policy.A further telegram transmitted [1S29 S.] by the Viceroy on the same date, gave Sir Henry&apos;s explanation of the sudden change in the Afghan attitude towards the British. He attributed it to the British protest against the Italian-Afghan treaty, which had doubtless been communicated to the Afghan delegation in Paris, and reported by them to Kabul. &apos; The inference that we regarded Afghanistan\as within the sphere of our political influence and that the contemplated treaty was to re-affirm our predominant interest, had been made the most of.
Discussions on the situation and the line io he adopted, by Sir Henry Dobbs were telegraphed [1850 S.] by the Viceroy on 28th July. Sir Henry begged that in any case his instructions as to the pis aller should be final, and should not admit of further yielding to Afghan pressure.Telegraphing [18-13 S.] on 30tli July, the Viceroy drew the conclusion from Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; recent, telegrams that there remained little hope of the Afghans accepting an exclusive treaty, and that it was imperative to,review the situation afresh. Weighty factors were the probability of frontier difficulties being further accentuated, and the question of our future policy iu regard to Afghanistan. It was the belief of the Government of India that, after Afghanistan^ definite rejection of our friendly offers, nothing short of another Afghan war, which there was good reason to avoid, and the utter defeat of the Afghans, would be likely to make her accept an exclusive treaty. On these grounds the Government considered that in tho last resort reversion to the pis alter was forced upon them. Assuming that Sir Henry Dobbs had correctly gauged the situation, they urged His iMajosty&apos;s Government to pass definite orders on the pis aller.On 30th July the Viceroy reported [1855 S.] that he had telegraphed to Sir Henry Dobbs reviewing the situation, and pointing out tho advantage there might be in the reversion to the pis alter, however repugnant it might be. The Government of India considered that the Afghan policy of independence would make them require a treaty with us as a set-oft against their treaty with Russia, and that this considera-tion would induce them to revert spontaneously to the pis aller, so as to ensure a quick conclusion to the negotiations, including the evacuation of the Arnawai. Failing such a move on the part of the Afghans, it was left to Sir Henry&apos;s discretion to make the offer personally.On 3rd August the Viceroy transmitted [1877 S.J a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs in which he said that he did. not share the forebodings of the Government of India regarding the position. He thought there was still, a chance of the Afghans accepting the exclusive policy, or something near it. The Afghan communi-cation which was promised for the 3rd or 4th August would make the situation clearer. He proposed to press for the exclusive policy up to the last moment, when, if he saw it was hopeless, he would try to induce the Afghans to propound the pis aller. The Viceroy emphasised the critical nature of the position and the necessity of decisive action in the event of Afghan rejection of the exclusive treaty ; he therefore begged for the orders of His Majesty&apos;s Government on tho pis aller.On 5th August the Secretary of State informed [3961] the Viceroy that his telegrams up to and including the foregoing had been considered by the Cabinet that morning On considering the situation in the light of the new factors in the case which had appeared since the matter was last before them, His Majesty&apos;s Government, who had always had a profound objection to the pis dller, were constrained to say that they thought that its adoption at this particular juncture would, be unwise and inexpedient. They were unable to authorize it, therefore, and considered that such authority as the Viceroy had given to Sir Henry Dobbs to utilize it should! be withdrawn.As a preferable alternative His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose a treaty, as between two civilized Powers, which would provide for reciprocal right to send envoys and consuls, and for other ordinary neighbourly relations, but would not involve us in the payment of any subsidy.On 6th August Sir Henry Dobbs was informed [1901 S.] by the Viceroy of the withdrawal of any authority, expressed or implied, for the negotiation of a pis alter treaty, and was instructed to assume that His Majesty&apos;s Government had negatived the policy of trying to induce the Afghans to propound it,The Viceroy transmitted [1909 S.] on 8th August a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs in which he reported a private meeting with Tarsi, who presented a draft treaty which he said had been prepared by the Amir&apos;s Council as absolutely final, to be taken or left. The draft treaty proved the Afghan proposals to be practically the pis alter with the inclusion of some objectionable features, such as the refusal to exclude consulates and the remission of fines for all frontier tribes. Further argument, Sir Henry said, would be useless and humiliating, and he proposed to present in writing the terms finally approved by the Secretary of State, and, failing their acceptance en bloc within 10 days, to take his departure. 31-3 - - B
In acknowledging the Secretary of Stat&apos;e&apos;s telegram ol 5th August, the Viceroy reported that (here seemed to be no hopes left of securing an exclusive treaty. For practical purposes they were confronted therefore by three alternatives: (I) complete rupture; (2) a treaty (without a subsidy) as between civilized nations; and (3) the pis alter. Rupture was to be avoided for momentous reasons, especially the possibility that conditions on the frontier might load, to war, and the serious effect on internal India. The treaty would be better than nothing at all, but would lower our position as regarded other Powers, and would leave Afghanistan free to attempt to blackmail us by stirring up troubles on the frontier. There remained, the pis alter. On the unanimous opinion of his Council and his military and. financial advisers which he himself shared, the Viceroy felt compelled to beg liis Majesty&apos;s Government to reconsider their decision.Telegrams from Sir Henry Dobbs, repeated [1030 S.] by the Viceroy on 11th August, reported the loss of the mission post-bag of 30th July. The Afghans alleged, that the post had been swept away by a flood near Jelalabacl, but after making all enquiry Sir Henry was left without doubt that the bag had been seized with the connivance of the Amir or Nadir Khan, and that the contents had been read. Tarsi, on being informed, had expressed great indignation at the incident, but Sir Henry, taking advantage of it to obtain delay, had informed Tarsi that all negotiations would be suspended until he had had time to consider what action he should take in the matter.On 12th August the Viceroy transmitted [1940 S.] the text of the Afghan note of 6th August.The Viceroy repeated. [1947 S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs on 13th August,: in which the latter referred to the postal incident as affording a dignified excuse for delay, during which it might be seen whether the Afghan attitude would be affected by any of the new factors mentioned by the Secretary of State. He deprecated a delay of more than a fortnight. He believed that if we could get some way towards meeting Afghan wishes about ammunition and rifles, there was ey,e.n yet a faint chance of the exclusive treaty.Telegraphing [19-19 S.J on 13th August the Viceroy pointed out that the spontaneous proposal of the Afghans for a pis alter treaty had placed them in the very position that it had been hoped Sir Henry Dobbs would be able to manoeuvre them. A comparison between the &quot;absolutely final&quot; proposals of 4th April [RE.P., xli, p. 3] with the &quot;absolutely final&quot; proposals now put forward, showed a great climb down, especially as regarded the subsidy and initial sum, their pretensions to Arnawai and the Turkish treaty. The Indian Government now thought that Sir Henry Dobbs should work as far as possible on the basis of these proposals and then let the Afghans have a treaty that we were prepared to accept.The Viceroy&apos;&apos;s Report. The following telegram was sent on 13th August:  Section L&apos; Madras. In connexion with the strikes in the Buckingham and Carnatic mills, it is now reported that three policemen were shot, one fatally. Details have been, called for. Ill-feeling between Paranyas and caste people in one village led to some incendiarism and looting, but this was soon suppressed. In Madura a collision occurred between non-co-operators and anti-non-co-operators, but no breach of the peace occurred.. In several districts there are increasing signs of opposition to non-co-operation.Section 2. , Bombay. Gandhi has announced that the total of the Tilak swaraj fund is 1 crore 5 lakhs, but it is estimated that only about 50 lakhs have actually been paid. Mahomed AlPs speeches at the All-India caliphate conference at Karachi, which was only attended by about 2,500 people on the first day and about half that number on second day, are reported to have disgusted the Shikarpur banyas, who formed a large part of the audience, and induced them to leave early.Section 3. The speeches at Karachi arc being examined by Bombay, with a view to the prosecution of the Ali brothers and. others responsible for the resolution proclaiming it sinful for moslems to enlist in the army or to help in recruiting. Picketing of liquor shops is reported to be intense in Ahmadabad.Section 4. On 25th July at Karachi, as the sequel to the sentence of 12 months&apos; rigorous imprisonment passed on Swarni Krislmand for obstructing the police^ in connexion with picketing liquor shops, the crowd pelted with stones anyone wearing
European head-dress, and several were injured. The crowd was dispersed by the police. The All-India Congress Committee met in Bombay on 28th and 29th July. The principal resolutions passed were : (1) The boycott of the Prince of Wales, in so far as to refrain from participating in or assisting in welcome, or attending any functions. The resolution declared that India bears no ill-feeling against the Prince, but the first is political, and is calculated to give strength and support to the present system of Government.(2) The boycott of foreign cloth. All congress organizations to concentrate on it until complete boycott is obtained by 30th September.(3) Mob excesses were deplored.(4) Civil disobedience was postponed until the completion of the boycott oE foreign cloth.(5) The continuance of the crusade against drink, and(6) The promotion of amity and good feeling with the neighbouring Asiatic States.On 1st August Gandhi, at a meeting in Bombay, destroyed by fire a piie of foreign wearing apparel; similar bonfires are reported elsewhere. - No actual picketing of cloth shops has yet been reported, but Gandhi has appealed to women to take part in the picketing. As separately reported, he has, in a speech at Aligarh, endorsed a proclamation that all foreign cloth contains pig&apos;s fat and cow s grease. The boycott has not hitherto had any striking results. It is reported that in,,Northern India the women object strongly to wearing khaddar.Section 5. There are no special incidents in connexion with the non-co-operation movement, and preventive measures, and counter propaganda are having good effect. There is appreciable success in the boycott of foreign cloth, but picketing is threatened. The strike on the Assam-Bengal railway continues, but is weakening, the strikers returning to work in large numbers, and the strike is expected) to end soon.Section 6. A small disturbance took place at the Jamalpur workshops on 1st August, clue to the efforts of some workers to enforce hartal in memory of Tilak&apos;s death. There was some stone-throwing, but the mob was dispersed by the police, several of whom were injured.Section 7. United Provinces. The anti-non-co-operation movement is having a good effect. The boycott of foreign cloth, although discussed, has not been given effect to. Loyal mohamedans are urging the desirability of a quick settlement of the terms of peace between Turkey and Greece.Section 8. The application of the Seditious Meetings Act has been withdrawn from the districts of Partabgarh, Rai Bareili, Sultanpur and Fyzabad. The brother of Sherwani (who was sentenced to one year&apos;s imprisonment, vide last political report) has resigned his post as Superintendent of Post Offices, owing to his brother&apos;s conviction. Swami Yoganand was sentenced at Bulandshahr to six months&apos; rigorous imprison-ment and a fine of Rs. 200 under sections 124a and 153a, I.P.C.C.S. Range Dyer, joint editor of the hide-pendent, -was sentenced to one year&apos;s rigorous imprisonment on failing to furnish his bond and sureties for Rs. 10,000 each.Section 9. The Local Government intend to prosecute Abdul Majid, of Budaon, for seditious speeches.   He is a violent speaker of some influence.Central Provinces. There is little activity on the part of the non-co-operation leaders. The boycott of foreign cloth is attracting few adherents. Only a few national schools survive.Punjab.--The Province has been remarkably quiet during the last fortnight. Propaganda amongst villagers is still carried on, and recruiting for the Congress Committee and Akali Dal continues.Lahore. The Commissioner reports indications, if the policy of non-payment of revenue taxes is declared, that some (? omission)s will take it up and it will be necessary to act vigorously and promptly. Meanwhile the collections of the revenue are normal. The policy of boycotting foreign cloth is not received with enthusiasm in Amritsar. The Seditious Meetings Act has been withdrawn in all four districts where it was in operation.Section 10.   Khartar Singh has been sentenced to two years&apos; and three other Sikhs to one year&apos;s rigorous imprisonment each, for taking forcible possession of Bal Lila Gurdwara.   Sayad Habib, the editor of the Siasat of Lahore, has been arrested for seditious writing.   The trial is proceeding. 31-3 C
Section 11.&apos; Bihar and Orissa. The situation has been quiet, and- the interest in non-co-operation is waning. The Panchayats have lost popularity as Courts of Justice, and Seva Samitis are little in evidence. National schools are meeting with . little success. Picketing of liquor shops has ceased in most places. The cow-killing question is coming into prominence- as the Bakr Id festival approaches. The split between hindus and mohamedans is exercising the minds of the non-co-operation leaders. Conciliation committees have been formed in most Bihar districts, but, owing to constant agitation, the masses are less amenable to discipline. The boycott of foreign cloth is not making much headway.Assam. Non-co-operation is less active, which may be due to the rainy weather. Counter-propaganda is actively carried on. The conviction of two local papers for arousing ill-feeling against European tea-planters is having a marked effect on the tone of the press.Section 12. 200 to 300 coolies in the Cachar tea gardens struck work and marched into Silchar. Details have not yet been received. Serious floods are reported from parts of the Assam Valley.Section 13. North-West Frontier Province.-The influence of the caliphate committee in Peshawar..is reported to have greatly diminished. The Deputy Com-missioner of Bannu reports the circulation of a fatwa directed against all Government services, supposed to have been sent by the caliphate committee, Lahore.Delhi. Political activities have slackened. Arrangements are contemplated for a vigorous start in the campaign against foreign cloth, also for a renewed campaign against liquor. The piece-goods Merchants&apos; Association have, however, resolved that ; the boycott of foreign cloth should not be directed against existing stocks.General. The situation as a whole is somewhat easier. Good rain has fallen over most of the country, and political activities have consequently declined.Section 14. The Committee on Repressive Laws has finished its sitting, and the report is being compiled.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.International Exhibition. On 4th August the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following telegram to the Officer Administering the Government of Canada : The participation of His Majesty&apos;s Government in various international exhibitions in which the British Empire as a whole might be interested has been recently invited by foreign Governments. It is thought desirable to set up in this country machinery for the joint preliminary examination of such proposals, find it is suggested that a standing committee, including representatives of the Dominions, should be formed and called together when necessary by the Department of Overseas Trade. Your Prime Minister favours the proposal, and suggests the High Com-missioner or his nominee as the representative of Canada, but has asked that the Canadian Government may be consulted officially. The other Prime Ministers concur in the proposed Committee. A reply by telegraph is requested in view of the proposals for the exhibition in Brazil, 1922.The Governor-General. Lord Byng telegraphed on 11th August that he had that day taken the prescribed oath, and assumed the office of Governor-General.AUSTRALIA.The following information was received by the acting High Commissioner on 12th August: Australian Navigation Act. The full Bench of the High Court delivered a unanimous judgment on the 8th instant as to the enactment and regulations of the Navigation Act, to the extent to which they purport to prescribe rules of conduct to be observed in respect of ships engaged solely in the domestic trade of a State beyond the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament.   The Act purports to deal with
four classes of shipping : first, ships registered in Australia, and engaged in inter-state or foreign trade; second, ships so registered engaged in intrastate trade; third, ships not registered hut engaged in interstate trade; fourth, ships not registered but engaged in intrastate trade. The High Court held that the Act applies to classes one and three, but not to classes two and four. It held further that by virtue of section 2, the provisions of the Act are severable in their application, so that invalidity as to classes two and four does not affect validity as to classes one and three.The proceedings arose on a demurrer by the Commonwealth to a statement of claim, by the Newcastle and Hunter Steamship Company, and 30 other plaintiffs, asking for an order to restrain the Minister for Trade and Customs from enforcing certain Navigation Act enactments as against shipowners only engaged in intrastate trade. In the Senate, Senator Duncan asked, &quot; Since this decision appears to limit the Act&apos;s application to a few interstate shipping companies, will the Government consider the advisability of disbanding the Navigation Department?&quot; Senator Russell, representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, replied that the provisions dealt with in the High Court judgment constitute relatively an unimportant portion of the Navigation Act. The control by the Commonwealth, not only of interstate shipping but of all oversea ships trading with Australia, remains unimpaired, and therefore there is no intention to disband the Navigation Branch.SOUTH AFRICA.Natal Licensing Ordinance. On 6th August the Governor-General of South Africa sent the following telegram: An Executive Council minute has been signed by me to-day, withholding assent to the Natal Rural Dealers Licensing Ordinance, 1921. When it was before the Natal Council this Ordinance aroused considerable Indian resentment.Indians in Natal. Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphed as follows from Capetown on 30th July : In an unofficial speech at Ginginhlovu (Natal) to-day, Mr. Reitz, Minister of Lands, uttered a grave warning as regards the drawing of hasty con-clusions on the Indian question, regarding which, of course, he said, he could not give any Government assurance. He urged all in Natal to realize that this was no local matter, but a world-wide significance. Indeed, the matter of the Indian franchise went far beyond the borders of Natal. The cpiestion was engaging the attention of British statesmen, and the people of Natal would sympathize with England in her present trouble and would not wish to add further to her embarrassments.The Band Wages Dispute. Telegraphing from Johannesburg on 3rd August Reuter&apos;s agent sent the following : The negotiations between the Chamber of Mines and the miners regarding wages on the Rand are proceeding. It is understood that they are being carried on in an amicable spirit and that, progress has been made in the direction of a settlement.The following further message was sent on 5tb August: The joint executives of the Trade Unions of the mining industry have accepted the Chamber of Mines&apos; latest offer in the wages dispute by a narrow majority.   The new offer agrees to the consolidation with wages of 21s. of the allowance of 21. 8s. granted 18 months ago -instead of the 24s. asked by the men, the remainder of the allowance to be subject to -variations in the cost of living.The Maize Crop. From Capetown on 3rd August ReuteFs agent telegraphed the -following : The Department of Agriculture reports that on 30th June the union&apos;a maize crop was 14 points and Kaffir corn 19 points below the average.
