GREAT BRITAIN.Unemployment Situation, The following summary of the situation is taken from the special report on&apos; unemployment for the week ending 23rd June, issued by the Ministry of Labour : Although there are signs in some divisions of a slight revival in the engineering-industry as the result of the termination of the recent dispute, the recovery is very gradual and employment is still far below normal. Some signs of activity in the shipbuilding industry are evident in the port of London area, but in the south-western division further discharges have been recorded. In the north-eastern division activity is confined to repair work, while in the north-western division there are signs of improvement at the chief centres. In Scotland there is general depression. The improvement in repair work in Wales continues. From all divisions come reports of a marked depression in the coal-mining industry, due chiefly to the large supplies of coal on hand, coupled with an extraordinarily low demand. In the north-eastern division the demand for iron and. steel is very low, and, although small cptantities of iron are being shipped abroad, home trade is almost at a standstill. Trade is very quiet in the building industry, especially in tbe south-western division. In the south-western division some slight seasonal improvement in the boot and shoe industry has been recorded, and is expected to continue.The position in the clothing industry generally remains unchanged, but in the south-western division some discharges have occurred in the dressmaking and tailoring-trades. The recent improvement recorded in the cotton industry steadily continues. In the north-eastern division the improvement in the woollen and worsted trades has been maintained, and it is reported that shoddy manufacturers are busy producing goods for export. In the Midlands the hosiery trade generally remains good, and in the lace trade some activity is reported, coupled with an improvement in the export trade. The Scottish linen industry continues to be active at Kirkcaldy, while the jute industry remains quiet.Depression continues at Bristol in the paper-making industry, but elsewhere there is little change to report. Although the pottery, china and earthenware industries remain depressed in the Midlands division there are signs of an increased steadiness at certain towns. In the south-eastern division considerable activity is reported in the seasonal trades of fruit-picking and jam-making. The fishing-industry in Scotland shows a slight improvement, but employment is still only intermittent. In the north-eastern division the prospects are very poor owing to the large number of trawlers laid up for repair.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.IRAQ.Intelligence Report. The following items are taken from the thirteenth Iraq Intelligence Report, dated 1st July 1922 :  Anglo-Iraq Treaty. The acceptance of the Anglo-Iraq treaty by the Council of Ministers, subject to its ratification by Congress, is the outstanding event of the past -fortnight. The extremists showed an inclination to resist, but were warned by the King that instigators of demonstration woidd be summarily dealt with, and collapsed without protest. The pro and anti-mandate Shaikhs of the Hillah division have assembled in Baghdad; the former have been bound over by the King to obey his orders, the latter have been accorded by him a gracious reception.The Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The Council of Ministers has resolved that the position of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in transferred territories must form the subject of a special concession from the Iraq Government.The Syrian Border. On the Syrian side a highly satisfactory meeting has taken taken place between the D. A. Dulaim and Captain Coux, the representative of the French authorities.   The question of the pacification of the Euphrates road was fully
discussed. It is believed in Mosul that the French are desirous of establishing themselves in Nisibin, but owing to tribal hostility, backed by Turkish officers, they have desisted from their first attempt in this direction. An armoured car recon-naissance in- the Sinjar region, in which the Chief of the General Staff of the Iraq army took part, was a useful correction of fears aroused by French activities on the Khabur.The Frontier Question. Ibn Saud has put forward die proposal that the frontier question should be settled in accordance with Shariah law or in accordance with &apos; Turkish practice,, he inheriting the rights of the Rashid. lie has also requested that the High Commissioner or a responsible representative may meet him in one of the Gulf ports and discuss with him the difficulties in which he finds himself placed with regard to the Iraq, the Hejaz and Trans-Jordania. The incidence of the Iraq question in a lively form owing to Mr. Philby&apos;s visit has considerably complicated these wishes.INDIA.The Fortnightly Report. The following report was sent on 18th July :  Madras. The political situation remains quiet, though some recrudescence of nou-co-operation activities is reported from the Godaveri district. An attempt was made on the 18th June to celebrate Gandhi day in Madras, but there was little enthusiasm shown. There are indications that a few of the local leaders of the extremist party are anxious to give up the congress creed in favour of the hindu panchayat movement. There is considerable dissatisfaction with the state of the congress accounts, and a serious split amongst caliphate volunteers. Efforts may be made to revive labour agitation on communist lines, but there is no great prospect of success.   The Moplah rebellion, as such, may be said to be at an end.Bengal. The general situation has undergone no appreciable change. Activities of the non-co-operation and caliphate parties are confined to the construction of a programme, but even in this &apos; r-espect are of meagre description. No really active steps are likely to take place until after the leaders, now in jail, have been released. The revolutionary party, which has captured certain congress committees and is suspected of participation in. dacoities, and of association with the communist party outside India, as evinced by the discovery of copies of &quot; Vanguard of Mohamedan Independence &quot; [published in Berlin], is a greater menace to the peace of the country. There is good reason to fear that a good deal is going on beneath the surface amongst members of this group.The chairman and vice-chairman of the Chittagong municipality, elected by the non-co-operation party, show no signs of a desire to set themselves against the district authorities.Bihar and Orissa. -The political situation continues to be quiet all over the province. Efforts of the leaders are now mainly directed to explaining why they are inactive. There seems no doubt that the non-co-operation movement has lost considerable ground in most places. Recovery of the cost of additional police in Tirhut is proceeding satisfactorily. The situation on the Eastern Bengal Railway is still anything but settled, though it is improbable that any general strike will take place in the near future.United Provinces. The political situation is much as before. There are signs of renewed activity, but not as yet on a serious scale. The general outlook is one of uncertainty. It may be that agitation wall be successfully started again, but this is very uncertain.Pundit Malaviya has addressed several crowds in the Gorakhpur district in defiance of orders under section 144, Criminal Procedure Code, issued by the sub-divisional officer.The local Government states, however, that it is, prima faeie&apos;, unlikely that section 188, Indian Penal Code, will be applicable in view of the onus placed on the prosecution by the second part of that section. So far as is known at present, the speeches were unobjectionable and the attendance at his meetings was small. .There are signs that dangerous revolutionaries are working more and more underground. The examination of speeches delivered at the recent congress meetings at Lucknow has revealed nothing calling for criminal action. Ordinary crime has decreased.
Punjab.-The political atmosphere remains calm. The khaddar campaign fails to arouse much enthusiasm among the masses. There is no sign of spontaneous political activities in the villages.   The outlook, appears quiet at present.The arrest of a number of congress and caliphate leaders and volunteers in connexion with picketing in Rawalpindi city led to some disturbance. This has now subsided. There has been no similar trouble elsewhere. Mota Singh, the well-known absconder in.the akali conspiracy case, was arrested on the 16th. The Shiromani gurdwara parbandhak committee appear to have met with some success in attempting to arouse opposition amongst Sikhs to the proposed gurdwara bill, but the committee appear to be somewhat undecided regarding future policy.Burma. Extremists appear to have captured the general council of the Burmese Association, which has decided that rural bodies, to be elected under the Rural Self-Government Act, should be boycotted. Following this decision, eight members of the executive committee resigned, and 21 leading Burman politicians and practically all the leading barristers and journalists have signed the manifestoes advising people not. to boycott rural councils. The extremists have received considerable accession in strength through the release of Oktama, who will,, it is believed, put himself at the head of the movement to boycott the reformed council, and his influence will be decisive with the monks and women who form the backbone of the extremist party. The more prominent Burmese and Indian-owned papers are all against the proposed boycott, but their opposition is not likely to be effective against the control exercised by the general council of the Burmese Association. It is probable, however, that the Indians will decide not to boycott the council, and that politicians will defy the general council and stand for the Legislative Council, but amongst the rank and file, of the politically-minded classes they will have little active following. The extremists will then be forced to announce the policy of active non-co-operation, but it is doubtful whether they will have the courage or ability to proceed beyond a purely negative policy of abstention.Central Provinces. Political,calm continues. Members of the non-co-operation party who are members of the Nagpur bar-have resumed practice. Picketing of liquor shops has increased somewhat, but is generally half-hearted.   Crime is low.Assam. There is practically nothing of political importance to report. Appre-apprehensions expressed by local officers as to the effect of Malaviya&apos;s tour at the beginning of the month, appear now to have been hardly justified. In Sylhet the cost of additional police has been collected without difficulty. No labour troubles have been reported.North-West Frontier Province. The political situation remains calm. Orders prohibiting political meetings in. Peshawar have expired, and there has been no evidence of a resumption of activities. There is some indication of tire recrudescence, of sikh activity in the Ilazara district.In connexion with the Bolshevik conspiracy case, eight Punjabi Muhajids (persons carrying on jihad)of the Chamarkand colony^-[Hindustani fanatics across the Buuer border] have been convicted.Delhi. Meetings organized by the congress and caliphate committees have been held at Delhi, but the exhortations of leaders have met with little response. The general belief is that the report of the civil disobedience committee will be to the-effect that the country at large is not properly prepared for mass civil disobedience,, and will be merely a device to save the face of the central organization.Bombay. There is nothing of particular importance to report. Interest is being aroused in the coming visit of the congress civil disobedience enquiry committee.. The central caliphate committee has nominated its members, six in all, to co-operate, with and accompany the congress committee, but to report to the caliphate committee.There are signs of disintegration in the congress party, and the disinclination of the caliphate party to co-operate with it is becoming pronounced. The proposed allied commission of enquiry into the treatment of Greeks in Anatolia by the Angora, Government is causing considerable resentment in Moslem circles, especially in view of the suppression of the report of the commission of enquiry into Greek atrocities at Smyrna, and a demand is growing for the publication of this report and a siinuF taneous enquiry into Greek atrocities in Anatolia.
The High Court has acquitted Hazrat Mohani on the charge under section 121, Indian Penal Code, holding that the case was at least doubtful and that it was open to the jury.to find the accused not guilty. No appeal seems to have been preferred, against this conviction under section .124a. .General. The proceedings of the civil disobedience enquiry committee now touring India are being held in camera. ;- .We hope soon to obtain inside information regarding these. Reports so far received, however, do not indicate that their rapid visits to various centres have had any appreciable results in rekindling enthusiasm for the non-co-operation movement. Popular interest in this is still on the decline, and the public show little interest in its meetings and other demonstrations. Friction between mahomedans and hindns in the Punjab is nowr openly admitted, and deplored by extremists, and elsewhere relations are distinctly strained. In the Punjab, the committee found that practically nothing had been done to organize the masses, and that dissensions were rife. It is probable that their report will fee in favour of postponing civil disobedience. This will not be acceptable to large numbers of the rank and file, and may lead to a split when congress meets in December. Should this happen, the non-co-operationist movement wall probably lose most of its more reputable and responsible members, and any manifestations attempted by the remainder are likely to be ill-organized and easy to deal with.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Assembly of the League of Nations. On. 7th July the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Government of Canada had appointed the Hon. W. S. Fielding, Minister of Finance, the Hon. Ernest Lapointe, Minister of Marine, and the Hon. P. C. Parkin, High Commissioner for Canada in London, members of the King s Privy Council for Canada, to be its representatives at the third assembly of the League of Nations.Signature of League of Nations Protocols [B.E.R., lxv, p. 7]. The Governor-General, telegraphing to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 6th July in. reply to the latter s telegram of Sth March, reported that an Order in Council had been passed on 3rd July approving the ratification, of the protocols of the amendment embodying amendments to articles 4, 6, 12, 13, 15, 26 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.AUSTRALIA.The Barcelona Declaration [B.E.R., Ixx, p. 5]. The Governor-General reported, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 7th July that the Government of the Commonwealth accepted the principle of the declaration and would be glad if he would arrange for signature on its behalf.Expropriated Properties for Sale in New Guinea. The High Commissioner for Australia (Sir Joseph Cook) has been advised that the Commonwealth Government is taking immediate action under the Commonwealth Expropriation. Ordinance 1920-21 of New Guinea and the regulations under the Commonwealth Treaty of Peace (Germany) Act, 1919-20, with a view to the sale of expropriated properties in New Guinea, comprising trading ventures, coconut plantations, and other assets. For the first series of such sales, now announced, tenders for purchase will be received up to 31st August by Mr. P. E. Deane, Custodian of Expropriated Properties, Prime Ministers Department, Melbourne.The properties on offer include prominent trading ventures; the New Guinea Company ; the Hamburgische Suclsee Aktiengesellschaft; and Hernsheim &amp; Co., Aktiengesellschaft, all at Rabaul, and a number of lots comprising plantation estates in various districts, buildings, copra dryers, and general equipment.Trade [B.E.R., lxxi, p. 5]. According to information emanating from the office of the High Commissioner in London the imports for the month of May were of the value of 9,315,2672., and the exports 11,584,8612., of which all but 357,5702. was Australian produce.
SOUTH AFRICA.The following items of information were telegraphed by ReuteFs agents : Expenditure on Railways. The estimates of expenditure from loan funds for the-&apos; year ending 31st March 1923 total 10,963,0001, of which 4,800,0001, are for railways and harbours. In this connexion it is to be noticed that the Railways Bill provides for the construction of new lines for agricultural development and gives the Government power to carry out the electrification of existing lines.   [Capetown, 11th July.]Expenditure Enquiry Committee. Speaking in the House of Assembly to-day, Mr. Burton, the Minister of Finance, announced that the Government accepted the principle of the recommendation made by the Assembly&apos;s Public Accounts Committee-regarding the appointment of a non-parliamentary committee not exceeding three members for the purpose of scrutinizing expenditure, and that it would immediately proceed to appoint a committee to investigate provincial expenditure and taxation, which is the subject of considerable public dissatisfaction.   [Capetown, 13th July.]Harbour Development.-The House of Assembly to-day adopted the loan esti-mates, including provision of 600,000Z. for harbour works at Walvis Bay. [Capetown,. 14th July.]Iron and Steel Industry Encouragement Bill. Mr. Malan, Minister of Mines and Industries, moving in the House of Assembly to-day the second reading of the Iron and Steel Industry Encouragement Bill, which was foreshadowed by General Smuts during the debate on the budget on 22nd May, said the main reason why the smelting industry hitherto had not been developed in the Union was the lack of capital. The present bill provided a system of bounties for approved concerns capable of achieving an output of 50,000 tons of pig-iron or steel annually. By a tapering system bounties would be payable on the amount of the first three years&apos; output at the rate of 15s. per ton of pig-iron and a further 15s. per ton for steel manufactured out of pig-iron, and thereafter at a diminishing rate until the expiration of the measure at the end of eight years, when he hoped Government assistance would be no longer needed. The Government for its part was assured of the existence of ample supplies of suitable raw material, and Mr. Malan, expressing bis views as to the future, was hopeful of starting am export trade.General Smuts, speaking earlier in the debate, said he regarded this and the Electricity BiU as the real foundation of the industrial system of the Union. The measure was given a general welcome, and the second reading was adopted unani-mously.   [Capetown, 14th July;]The Honours Question. A motion on the honours question, proposed by Mr. Reitz,, came up in the South African Senate to-day. The motion, which was to the effect that the Union Government should not recommend, recognize or consent to recognize titles bestowed from outside the Union on citizens of the dominion, was . rejected by 20 votes to 9. The discussion gave rise to no noteworthy features. [Capetown, 17th July.]
