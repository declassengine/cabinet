GREAT BRITAIN.The Labour Situation. The following paragraphs are taken from the Report on the Labour Situation issued by the Ministry of Labour on 6th September: The trade union congress opened at Cardiff on Monday, 5th September. As was to be expected, a large part of the early proceedings was devoted to the consideration of the unemployment position, but no new constructive proposals emerged from the discussion. Some time was also spent on an attack upon the Ministry of Labour&apos;s index number. A noteworthy circumstance was the presence&apos;of delegates from the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers (the successor of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees), which is now affiliated to-the congress. An unexpected demand at the congress for a shorter working Week, coupled with Mr. Thomas&apos; plea for the retention of the 48-hour week on the Irish railways, and Mr. Hicks&apos; recent call to the defence of the 4-4-hour week in the building trades, point to the likelihood of a stronger resistance on the part of labour to an &quot; attack on hours &quot; than to the &quot; attack on wages.&quot;The agitation on the part of the unemployed for increased poor relief, which was referred to last week, has now spread from London to other parts of the country. Apart from this there is a marked absence of serious labour troubles, and the printing trade remains the sole important centre of unrest, although no stoppage has yet developed.The improvement in the unemployment position, as shown by the live register totals, is steadily maintained. The estimated total of the live register of all employ-ment exchanges on 2nd September was 1,527,500 as compared with 1,575,800, the corresponding figure for the previous week.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;e.ADEN.Relations with the Imam [B.E.R., li, p. 2]. On 30th August the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Resident at Aden his concurrence in the latter&apos;s proposed action regarding the Imam.EGYPT.Propaganda against the Sidtan. Telegraphing [No. 532] from Cairo on 6th September, Mr. Scott reported that on the occasion of the mohamedan new year a congratulatory telegram was sent by a committee to &quot;His Highness our Lord the Khedive,&quot; for transmission to the Sultan of Turkey as Caliph. This telegram was signed by a brother of the late Nationalist leader, Ali Fahmi Kamel by name.Prince Mohanied Ali is connected with this committee, and in describing its proceedings the new Watanist newspaper Al Lewa Al Masri referred to him by the title which had been held by princes before the accession of a Sultan of Egypt.These proceedings have caused considerable sensation. They are clearly propaganda in favour, of the deposed Khedive and against the Sultan. The news-paper will be either suspended or closed clown, and Sarwat Pasha has asked that measures may betaken against Ali Fahmi Kamel under martial law on the ground that a native court would be most unlikely to convict him. He, Mr. Scott, reminded Sarwat Pasha of our reluctance to use martial law, but the importance of making an example was urged in reply: he agreed with this, and therefore, subject to Lord CurzoiFs approval, proposed to take measures accordbigly.On 10th September Lord Curzon informed [No. 433] Mr. Scott that if he and Sarwat Pasha were convinced of the necessity of applying martial law he reluctantly
acquiesced, though he strongly disliked its application, and could hardly believe it to-be necessary in the case of so obscure an individual.Three days later Mr. Scott telegraphed [No. 540] that having gone into the matter-again very carefully, he considered the application of martial law a matter of necessity and was issuing instructions for action to be taken.The ex-Khedive, Mr. Scott said, had not ceased his efforts to re-establish himself in the country, and his agents were commonly refused admission. It seemed no less desirable to expel Ali Bey Kamel, and his expulsion would have a salutary effect upon the members of a treason party which might become dangerous if it were not firmly dealt with. The Sultan had sent him, Mr. Scott, a message urging that his prestige was at stake, and the acting Prime Minister adhered to his opinion that if such an offence were overlooked the effect would be very bad.The coming Visit of the Labour Members of Parliament. On 4th September Mr. Scott telegraphed [No. 528] to Lord Oiirzon asking that the four Labour members who proposed to visit Egypt should be refused passports. Sarwat Pasha was considerably perturbed by the possibility of evil effects following their visit; Zagioul intended, he said, to organize demonstrations of welcome, and Adly&apos;s party counter-demonstrations. The contemplated visit would increase the resentment already felt in the country in regard to some of the questions which had been asked in the House of Commons about Egypt. In his, Mr. Scott-s&apos;, opinion the visit would embarrass the Egyptian Government and be most inopportune.Lord Ourzon replied [No. 432] on 10th September to the effect that some of the party had already started with visas for Egypt, and could not be stopped. They had, however, been warned of the responsibility which lay upon them! in view of the anticipated clangers.PALESTINE.Disturbance at Amman. The following telegram from the High Commissioner was received by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 5th September:  A Syrian notable, Ibrahim Hanano, wanted by the French on a criminal charge, has been asked, for by the French and arrested in Palestine under the extradition treaty and, pending the examination of his case, is in custody. Among the Sherifians and their sympathizers in Amman the arrest has caused some aggravation, partly, perhaps, because it has helped to dispel the Sherifian conviction that we secretly favour anti-French proceedings, but also to a large extent because Hanano had come over presumably unsuspectingly from Trans-Jordania with a letter of introduction to us from Mr. Abramson, who did not know his record. Hanano perhaps assumed the letter to be a safe conduct. On 1st September disorderly crowds in Amman seized Mr. Peake and threatened him with death if he did not produce Hanano within half an hour. He was rescued by officers and men of the reserve force and gendarmerie. The Royal Air -Force car and. officers [? were threatened] with rifles in the street. On the morning of 2nd September all possible aeroplanes proceeded to Amman. On the evening when the news arrived Mr. Abramson was in Jerusalem. He left at 4 a.m. on 2nd September by aeroplane, returned at 4 p.m. and reported the disturbance to be due to Abdul Kadir Muzaffar, who at a meeting had., with the help of Syrians, worked up feeling and used Auda Abu Taya for their purpose. On hearing the news Abdullah immediately sent Shaker to Amman to maintain order, to apologize to Mr. Peake and to arrest Muzaffar. Mr. Abramson [? emphasized] the seriousness of the affair, insisted that Shaker must hold an enquiry and arrest all the principal people present at the meeting, and that Abdullah must dismiss the Syrians as [? named] by Mr. Abramson. Abdullah hesitated, but finally agreed. Mr. Abramson was assured . by Abdullah of his own [?&quot;loyalty] and that of his Hedjazi followers, and he appears anxious to convince Mr. Abramsou by real co-operation. The incident is unpleasant, but may prove useful ultimately.MESOPOTAMIA.Relations witfi Ibn Saud [B.E.R., 11, p. 3].-On 30th August the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed [No. 359] to the High Commissioner for Iraq, congratulating him on the successful result of his diplomacy. The general purport of Ibn Saud&apos;s letter was, Mr. Churchill said, most gratifying.
Alleged Statement by the King of Iraq concerning the Reconquest of 8yria. The following telegram was sent by the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of -State for the Colonies on 30th August: I have just received a letter from Colonel Newcombe, British agent at Haifa,, dated 18th July, forwarding demi-officially details of an interview with General Gouraud which he had-just had. He mentioned that a copy was being sent to Mr. Shuckburgh. On page 2 of the memorandum of the interview he writes that General Gouraud had informed him that &quot; on 15th July Mr. (?) Chardin, the French consul at Baghdad, telegraphed to Beirut saying that on 10th July the Emir Feisal had addressed press representatives in Baghdad in the presence of the British political officers and said that with the help of God and of the sons of Mesopotamia he (? hoped to) conquer Syria.&quot;This morning, 30th August, the French consul came to see me on other business.. When it was concluded I asked him if he had yet heard how that report of the alleged speech of Emir Feisal had reached Beirut. His reply was that he had received no news whatever. He was confronted with Colonel Newcombe&apos;s report,, from which it was clear that General Gouraucbs statement had been made a week before the matter had ever been bruited here.It was emphasized to the French consul that the report as sent in state(d) that British political officers were preseut, and was much worse than we had ever contem-plated. In reply to this, he suggested that Mr. Cornwallis might have been present,. I rejoined that if Mr. Cornwallis had been present on the occasion in question it was. all the more impossible that Emir Feisal could have made such a statement as that attributed to him.Finally, I said that he could do what he pleased about the matter, but that mean-while if he had any business he could see my secretary, as I would have no further personal dealings with him.Naqib and the G.B.E. The High Commissioner for Iraq informed [No. 471] the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 6th September&apos; that, as directed, he had communicated to Naqib the grant of G.B.E. at the end of the. letter thanking him and the council for their services. In his reply Naqib had said that he was not equal to-the task of expressing thanks for His Majesty&apos;s gracious act in conferring upon him that high decoration. He had therefore requested the High Commissioner to submit to His Majesty the expression of his sincere gratification for that high distinction. The High Commissioner added that he should be glad if the Secretary of State would kindly take such action as might be appropriate. Naqib and the council were, he-added, greatly pleased at that mark of His Majesty&apos;s favour.Armenian Refugees. On 10th September the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed. [No. 382] the High Commissioner for Iraq that the following decisions had been recorded by the Cabinet on 7th September :--(a) That the High Commissioner should be informed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies that - while the utmost possible should be done on humanitarian grounds to assist the refugees and to make the most economical use of the grants which have already been voted, it was not possible to provide further grants from imperial funds.(6) That the above decision should be made public and every facility offered to-voluntary sympathizers to transmit funds obtained from charitable sources.INDIA.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., li, p. 4]. The Viceroy telegraphed [2050 S.j on 25th August a message from Sir Henry Dobbs, in which the latter gave a summary of the letter received from Tarsi, already reported, and his reply thereto. This reply animadverted on the want of diplomatic courtesy in allowing Sir Henry to-discover the ratification of the Russian treaty from newspaper statements; secondly, Tarsi was reminded that he had not furnished the information regarding the contents of that treaty, as he had been requested to do; and, thirdly, pointed out that the British objections regarding consulates was the want of distinction between
&quot;points&quot; and &quot;frontier tracts.&quot; Pie added that without a complete knowledge of the contents of the Russian treaty, in order to assure the British Government that it contained nothing fundamentally opposed to Plis Majesty&apos;s Government, he would, be unable to consider a final draft of a treaty of friendship.&apos; lie reiterated his request for the disclosure of the treaty with Russia. Failing TarsPs compliance by 29th August, Sir Henry suggested that he should state his inability to wait beyond 3rd September.Commenting on the above, the Viceroy said his Government agreed with Sir Henry&apos;s views and his proposal for a time limit.Telegraphing [2074 S.] on 29th August, the Viceroy transmitted three telegrams from Sir Henry Dobbs, elated 17th, 19th and 23rd August respectively, advocating that the title &quot; His Majesty &quot; should be conceded, and suggesting that it would be in accordance with precedent, as in the dase of Habibullah, if the first use of this style should emanate in a message from the King. As regarded ratification, he had understood that it needed only to be dispensed with in the cas,e of an exclusive treaty, but it now appeared that the Government disagreed...: The Viceroy said that his Government endorsed Sir Henry&apos;s recommendations regarding the title of &quot;Plis Majesty&quot; and recommended that ratification be dispensed with, whatever the form of treaty might be, in order to put an end to the present state of uncertainty on the frontier.Replying to the above, the Secretary of State telegraphed [4634] on 7th September general approval of the recommendations.On 30th August the Viceroy telegraphed [2085 S.] a report from Sir Henry Dobbs that he had received two letters from Tarsi, of which he transmitted a summary. The first referred to Muhammad Wali&apos;s reception in London, when ho was informed that he was there in an unofficial capacity, and that the work he proposed to do would be done by the Government of India in Kabul. Tarsi implied that Wali had gone to London on the initiative of Sir Henry Dobbs, and stated that his Government considered that such unfriendly actions showed that the ideas of the British Govern-ment about Afghan independence were unsatisfactory. The Afghans might show that Dobbs was negotiating at Kabul on behalf of Fits Majesty the King of England, not on behalf of the Government of India.Sir Henry pointed out that the omission of the usual ceremonious language, and the mention of his name without the ordinary honorific accompaniment, made the language of the letter deliberately insulting.Sir Henry replied to the effect that he regretted the unusual style of the letter, and proceeded to relate the facts regarding WalPs visit as received by him from his Government, which differed from VVali&apos;s report. He asked to be informed whether Wali, in ignorance of diplomatic procedure, had attempted to discuss matters in London over the heads of Tarsi and himself, or whether he had pursued this unusual course under instructions from the Afghan Government.TarsPs second letter acknowledged Sir Henry&apos;s letter reiterating his request for the disclosure of the Russian treaty, and complained of the charge of discourtesy. He stated that consulates of a third State opposed to the British Government would not be established at the fixed points or the fixed tracts, and that there was not much difference between the two expressions. He informed Sir Henry tha&apos;t a copy of the Russian treaty would appear in the local newspaper, where he would be able to read it.   Afghanistan desired real independence and had no desire to injure anyone.On receipt of this the Viceroy instructed Sir Henry Dobbs that ho should send some member of the mission to Tarsi to warn him courteously, but emphatically, that when the British Government came to know of the rudeness and discourtesy offered to him, following the violation of the diplomatic bag, Sir Henry anticipated the receipt of summary orders to quit Kabul.The continuation of the foregoing was telegraphed [2095 S.] by the Viceroy on 31st August. Sir Henry Dobbs reported that he had sent a reply noting Tarsi&apos;s refusal to furnish him with the official copy of the treaty, and saying that he was consequently compelled to take as correct the version furnished by the Soviet Govern-ment, which was the only official version that had been received. He drew attention to the fact that a provision in the latter, regarding the establishment of a Russian consulate towardsthe Indian frontier, was completely at variance with the undertaking which the Afghan Government were prepared to give. There was no more to be said.3?-3B
In face of the above letters Sir Henry deemed it useless, and exposing tkem to indignity, for the British representatives to remain in Kabul. He invited instructions as to whether he shoidd leave Kabul immediately, or should propound the alternative treaty, which he designated as the gentlemanly treaty, for acceptance within seven clays.The recommendations put forward by the Viceroy were: (1) If Sir Henry, by acting on the instructions he had received, succeeded in clearing the air by 3rd September, he should give the Afghan Government seven days to choose between the pis aller and the gentlemanly treaty. (2) If the Afghans made no amends, he should make immediate preparations for his departure, and demand final official meetings to summarize the negotiations, and to announce the rupture as the consequence of the mail bag incident, the insulting tone of the recent communications, and the discourteous refusal to disclose the Russian treaty.On 2nd September the Viceroy repeated [2109 S.] a report from Sir Henry that three members of the mission had seen Tarsi on 1st September and had delivered the message conveyed in the Viceroy&apos;s instructions of 30th August (vide supra). Tarsi, who seemed more conciliatory, had said that he had despatched a copy of the treaty, which Sir Henry should receive on 2nd September. He had admitted the irregular tone of his letter concerning Waifs reception, and had said he was in consultation as to the best way of repairing the error. He had again emphasized the desire of the Afghans for a treaty with the British Government. He had also said that Jamal was leaving the following clay for good.The Secretary of State informed [4503 and 4520] the Viceroy on 2nd September that before dispersing for the holidays the Cabinet had approved of the telegram which he was then sending, which contained the following points : His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed with the Viceroy on the impossibility of relying on Afghan good faith, but doubted whether the grant of a subsidy would ensure the observance of a treaty. Notwithstanding this, and the fact that the Bolshevik treaty appeared to have been ratified by the Afghans without modifications, in view of the Viceroy&apos;s repeated representations, Bis Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to agree to the procedure recommended by the Viceroy in his telegram of 20th August, viz., that Sir Henry Dobbs should place before the Afghans a final choice between pis aller as amended by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the gentlemanly treaty, giving them seven days only in which to make up their minds. There were certain points to be included in the pis oiler which His r7lajesty&apos;s Government had throughout regarded as indis-pensable. They must require, therefore, as a sine qua non the full disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty, the exclusion of all foreign consuls from the frontier zone, and the restoration of the undertaking not to interfere with our tribes, and of the proviso regarding the Arms Convention. The payment of the subsidy should be made quarterly and not in a lump sum, and should not exceed 20-g- lakhs. It was suggested that the first payment should follow the evacuation of Arnawai. The duration of either treaty should be for three years only.The telegram enumerated various considerations which it was desirable Sir Henry Dobbs should have in his mind when putting forward his arguments. These, &apos; coupled with a clear indication that we should recede no further, would induce the Amir to realize where his advantage lay. The procedure now proposed, although it did not remove the objections of His Majesty&apos;s Government, reduced them to a minimum, and, it was hoped, would have the result which both they and the Government of India desired.Bull instructions based on the above were telegraphed [2124 S.] on 6th Sep-tember by the Viceroy to Sir Henry Dobbs, who in the meantime had reported [2113 S.] the receipt of a message from Tarsi on 2nd September, saying that as it was Friday the promised copy of the treaty and the amended letter could not he delivered until the following clay.On 6th September the Viceroy transmitted [2127 S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs dated 3rd September, in which he reported the receipt of a printed copy of the Russo-Afghan treaty, under a polite covering letter from Tarsi. Attached were copies of one letter from Surits, and two from Raskolnikof. Except for the addition of Khokand as an Afghan consulate and for the omission of the supplementary clause, the treaty was identical with the text published by the Manchester Guardian and later confirmed by Krassin.
The letter from Surits, dated 28th June, referred to the difficulties of (he Afghan Government with regard to the consulates at Kandahar and Ghazni, which.were to be granted to Russia under the treaty. Surits gave an undertaking that he would inform his Government of these difficulties immediately after the ratification of the treaty, and expressed a hope that his Government, anxious to remove all difficulties, would give the matter earnest consideration. For the present he would not open these consulates.In his first letter, dated 23rd July, Raskolnikof confirmed Surits&apos; promise, and considered himself bound by it. His second letter, dated 31st July, expressed his confidence that the undertaking was fit to be accepted, and equally that it would not cause any delay in the performance of the clauses of the ratified agreement.Sir Henry called attention to an important sentence in Tarsi&apos;s covering letter, in which he said he was assured that the Russian Government would not establish consulates in the places specified, and the Afghan Government would not be compelled to give permission for them.Commenting on these documents Sir Henry pointed out the weakness of the position regarding the consulates. If the Soviet Government declined to accede to her representative^ suggestions, any undertaking given to us by Afghanistan not to allow them would be in direct opposition to her undertaking with Russia. There would be no guarantee that any assurance given by the Soviet would be otherwise than temporary. Finally, as the treaty was ratified on 3rd August, the three letters technically cancelled the undertakings and suggestions contained therein. It was improbable that any reply to Surits&apos; representations could be received from the Soviet Government before the end of October. In all these circumstances, Afghan assurances about consulates could not be accepted, and Sir Henry considered that the pis aUer was out of court for the present. Moreover, the Afghans had failed to communicate the supplementary clause and the secret clause about munitions. In sir henry&apos;s view, therefore, the only course open to us was immediately to put forward the gentlemanly treaty.Sir Henry reported the withdrawal by the Afghan Government of their discourteous letter regarding Wall and, in consequence, his own withdrawal of his reply.The Viceroy&apos;s Re-port. The following telegram was sent on 9th September:   Section 1.   We regret the delay in despatching, clue to a very great volume ofwork in connexion with the Moplah disturbances and Assembly questions andresolutions.Section 2. Bombay. There is nothing of fresh interest to report for the second fortnight of August. 20th August, picketing of liquor shops was resumed in the Dadar section of Bombay city.Punjab. A. sudden and unusual rise in the price of wheat has caused alarm among the people and concern to the local Government and the Government of India. It has been, utilized by non-co-operators as another instance of Government mistakes. Lajpat Rai attributed the prevailing high prices to a faulty system of distribution, and said if non-co-operators were in charge of the Government they would soon bring-down the price of staples by a reduction of the military expenditure and the pay of civil servants, Some district officers consider the high prices to be due to a shortage of stocks, but this is as yet doubtful. The Minister of Agriculture and the Financial. Commissioner are visiting important centres to investigate. Neither swadeshi nor the liquor movement is making much headway, and picketing is on the decline. The Sikhs are still inclined to be hostile, and the new gurdwara parbandha committee has maintained its adherence, to non-co-operation, and is said to contemplate a fresh attack on the shrines. (? But) the Sikh situation has distinctly deteriorated, and is again causing some anxiety.Section 3. Assam.- Gandhi&apos;s visit, has passed off quietly ; he met the European planters, and explained he had room in his swaraj for the non-official Englishman. The Governor on tour has been well received everywhere.Bengal. The situation continues quiet, but a press telegram received this morning states that Gandhia arrival in Calcutta has given a fresh impetus to the movement and that picketing has commenced vigorously. The coolies have been persuaded not to carry bundles of foreign cloth. Business is reported to be much affected, but there has been no disturbance. A conspiracy to escape from Barisal 32-3 C
jail has been frustrated. The strike on the Assam-Bengal railway continues, with some violent incidents. . ,Section 4. Bihar and Orissa.-The anticipated renewal of increased activity on the part of non-co-operationists has not been realized. The renewal of liquor shop picketing in most places only flickers ; a general stand has been made against such intimidation. Gandhi toured in the province; he had a cool reception in Paina, but a considerable welcome in Bihar. Some attempts have been made in Muzaffarpur and Champaran to revive the agitation against the planters. A number of acts of incendiarism directed against the Government schools have been reported from Orissa. There have been no developments in the caliphate movement.Section 5. - Central Provinces. There has. been some revival of political meetings, but the bulk of the speeches have been comparatively moderate. The Governor touring has found signs of a better spirit among the public at large.North-West Frontier Province. During the second half of August the political situation was generally quiet. The very high prices of the necessary food grains is the only cause for anxiety.Delhi. Much excitement is being worked up amongst the lower class mohamedans over the confiscation of 800 copies of a leaflet containing an abstract of a fatwa issued by the Jamiat ulema ihincl.Section 6. A leaflet containing words calculated to seduce nioslem troops from their duty was proscribed by the chief commissioner of Delhi at our suggestion. The local leaders consulted Gandhi about starting civil disobedience, but he advised that there should be no premature action. Some extremist maulvis have been in Delhi in private conclave with a delegation of maulvis, and advised an emergency meeting of the Jamiat in Delhi at the end of muharram. A number of meetings already held had been largely attended and fiery speeches delivered ; all mohamedans are exhorted to resist&quot; this attack on the faith. The situation is regarded as serious owing to the way the feelings of ignorant masses are being played upon. The congress organization issued a special appeal to tailors, weavers and washermen to further swacleshi by charging enhanced prices for work done on foreign cloth. A separate appeal has been made to the liquor trade. The chief commissioner has asked for authority to reimpose the Seditious Meetings Act at any moment. We are considering this in Council. -;Section 7. United Provinces. A press report states that food riots have occurred at Meerut. The general main interest is centred in the Moplah rebellion, echoes of which have extended to Madras, Karur and other parts of the presidency. The general tone of the press is one of support to the Government in quelling the Moplah rising, though the extremist papers, such as the Hindu of Madras and the Independent of Allahabad, have suggested that Government officials are responsible, and moderate papers desire to know the spark that caused the flame to blaze, and to be assured that martial law will be administered according to the principles and standards of conduct laid down by you in your despatch on the Hunter report. Both houses of the Legislature adjourned to-day to discuss the Moplah rising. The general tone of the debates was distinctly in support of our action ; the necessity for martial law was generally admitted. The Viceroy&apos;s speech at the formal opening on the 3rd was very well received. High prices give grounds for some apprehension in the Punjab and the north of the United Provinces.Section 8. The situation in Delhi and among the Sikhs in the Punjab is also somewhat disquieting, but we are watching events closely.The Duke of GonnaugMs Visit. The following paragraphs are taken from a despatch of the Government of India, dated 21st duly : (1) It will be seen from the reports that the visit of His Royal Highness was a. great success, and that the non-co-operating party experienced a correspondingly; severe political reverse. Everywhere the programme of events were carried out successfully, and the failure of those who attempted to introduce a boycott was manifest.(2) Some disappointment was expressed that no striking political announcement was made, but on the whole the effect of the visit was admirable, in that it went far to introduce a more friendly attitude between the different sections of the community. In Bombay the efforts of the non-co-operators met with utter failure.
THE DOMINIONS.AUSTRALIA.Court of International&apos; Justice.- The following telegram was sent by the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 30th August: The Australian National Group proposes on this occasion to nominate the candidates nominated by Great Britain, and assumes that there is no objection to this -course. It would be glad if you would cable urgently the names of Great Britain&apos;s nominees.In reply to this, Mr. Churchill telegraphed on the following day that Great Britain had nominated Lord Finlay, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome his nomination by the Commonwealth Government.Assembly of the League of Nations.-On 5th Sept-ember the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State that Messrs. Stanley Melbourne Bruce, M.C., M.P., and Malcolm Lindsay Shepherd, I.S.O., acting High Commissioner for Australia, had been appointed senior representative and representative respectively of the Commonwealth of Australia at the second session of the Assembly of the League of Nations.Nauru-Oil 30th August the Secretary of State telegraphed as foRows to the Governor-General: A. request has been received from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations for a report on the recent administration of Nauru. In view of the present arrangements for the administration of Nauru, the report would be more properly prepared by the Commonwealth Government, It is suggested that it would&apos; be convenient if the report could cover the period up to the date when the mandate was confirmed by the Council of the League, viz., 17th December 1920. His Majesty&apos;s Government have already communicated to the League^ a report on the civil administration of Mesopotamia (Parliamentary paper, Cmd. 1061), and it is proposed to communicate a similar paper on Tanganyika, Cmd. 1428. Other reports are being prepared.The acting High Commissioner for Australia has received the following items -of news from the Prime MinisteFs department, Melbourne : (1) Repatriation of Soldiers. The Government of Australia is vigorously maintaining its policy of practical repatriation. Over 24,000 returned soldiers so far have been settled on the land, their distribution being as follows : Victoria 7,845,. New South Wales 5,782, West Australia 3,905. Queensland 2,413, South Australia 2,345, Tasmania 2,309. The Government is now raising a 10,000,O00L loan for the extension of various forms of repatriation.(2) The Geneva Labour Conference. For the&apos;.representation of Australia at the-forthcoming international Labour conference at Geneva, the trade unions were invited to submit nominations, and the Government has selected Mr. T. Merry, a working-painter, of Adelaide.(3) Butter Export. It is expected that Australia will export 40,000 tons of butter to the United Kingdom this season. It is pointed out that, owing to the high freights, shipments will cost 48O,O00Z. compared with 18O,0O0L in the year before the war,(3) The genuine enthusiasm displayed .on the occasion of the opening of the -Chamber of Princes showed how deep-seated is the loyalty of ludian princes to the royal house. The inauguration ceremony was impressive in the extreme, and its effect will certainly be far-reaching. Secondly, the opening of the Indian Legislature, -accompanied as it was by His Royal Highness&apos;s touching appeal for good feelino- and cordiality, was a scene which none who were present will ever forget. The effect of His Royal Highness&apos;s gracious bearing and heartfelt earnestness has since been perceptible, not merely in the toue of the&quot;deliberatious of the new Legislature, but also in the changing political atmosphere of India at large.(-1) In conclusion we desire to express our deep sense of obligation to His Royal Highness for undertaking this arduous but successful mission, for the gracious part he played in the impressive ceremonies at Delhi and elsewhere, and for the beneficial results upon the political situation achieved by his presence in India.
but aii announcement has been made that no reduction is possible owinw to the cost of running overseas steamers.(-1) Wool. Optimism, prevails in the Australian wool houses over the reports of the results of the new series of London wool sales. The Australian market is also satisfactory. Over 17,000 bales were offered at Brisbane this week and practically all were auctioned. Super fleece sold at about war prices; good average fleece from 5 to 10 per centum higher; skirtings 20 per centum higher. The competition was keen.SOUTH AFRICA.The Future of Rhodesia. ReuteFs Capetown correspondent reported as follows on 3rd September : The members of the Rhodesian constitutional deputation who are proceeding to London to confer with the Colonial Office regarding the question, of responsible-government for Rhodesia, have had several interviews with General Smuts, the Prime Minister. They did so at the request of Mr.-Churchill, and while explaining their own position they asked for a communication of the terms upon which the Union Govern-. ment were prepared to receive Rhodesia into the Union.General Smuts said that the Union Government would welcome the early Admission of Rhodesia into the Union. Its admission was contemplated already under the South Africa Act, and the Rhodesian representatives, including Sir Charles Coghlan, had had seats on the national convention which made specific provision for the ultimate incorporation of Rhodesia into the Union. That expressed the policy of. the Union. .... The Union Government were not at present prepared off-hand to announce definite and final terms. In a round table conference they wished to hear what their views were, and what their wishes were, and to discuss with them in. how far it was constitutionally and financially possible to accede&apos; to those views and wishes.....-While definite terms of incorporation could therefore be finally settled only at a. conference such as he had suggested, he desired to make it clear to them, what the general attitude of the Union Government was on the matter. Not only were the Union Government anxious that Rhodesia should be admitted into the Union as soon as possible, that was to say, as soon as its people of their own free motion asked for such admission, but the Union Government was also willing- to accord fair and generous terms for such admission. As was done in the case of Natal and Orangia at the inception of the Union, generous parliamentary representation would be given to Rhodesia beyond what she would be strictly entitled to on the score of her population.. Her large area and still undeveloped state would make it necessary to promote and accelerate her economic and agricultural development as much as possible, for that purpose it would be necessary at once to acquire on behalf of the State the chief means of her development and to acquire the land and railway rights of the Chartered Company   ....The views he had placed before them would be communicated to the Secretary of State so that the Imperial Government might further consult them and the Union, and might take such steps regarding Rhodesia as they deemed proper under the circumstances.Telegraphing again on 8th September ReuteFs Capetown agent further reported that Sir Charles Coghlau and Messrs. Leggate and Mechlery, the members of the Rhodesian Constitutional Delegation, had issued a statement to the people of Southern Rhodesia on the eve of their departure for London, declaring that General Smuts&apos; recent statement created no new situation as regarded the constitutional issue. While fully appreciating the Union GovenimenPs sympathetic attitude, the delegates felt as-strongly as ever that Southern Rhodesia should assume control of its own affairs before any decision for incorporation in the Union was arrived at.Railicays Retrenchment Policy. On 1st September the following telegram was sent from Johannesburg by Renter&apos;s representative : The Railway Administration&apos;s reply to the deputation from the South African Industrial Federation, which interviewed the Minister of Railways on 27th August regarding retrenchment on the railways, states that it has no intention at present of paying off more than the 309 temporary men whom it had already decidecl to dismiss as part of its policy of retrenchment.
