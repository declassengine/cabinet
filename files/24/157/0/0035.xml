COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.PALESTINE.Administrative lteport [B.E.R., lxxiii, p. 2]. The following information is taken from the administrative report for the month of June 1922 : Concerning the agricultural service and the harvest it is reported that the May rains favourably affected the germination and development of summer crops.&quot; Threshing of winter crops is in progress. The superiority of the wdreat crop, as compared with barley, is marked, aud its greater resistance to prolonged drought firmly established. A preliminary assessment in the Jerusalem district, for example, gives a decrease of 60 per cent, in the yield of the barley crop under last yeaPs figures, but of 15 per cent, only in the wheat crop.&quot;The fruit crops are satisfactory and all vegetable crops are doing well.The veterinary service has been busy in operations for the testing of imported cattle. Disease and infection have been discovered among importations from Germany and from Rumania and the cases have been dealt with. &quot; The interest attaching to these cases arises from the possible source of infection and the character of the disease.&quot; In the case of Rumanian dairy cattle piroplasmosis (red water) has been indicated.The results of the measures taken for the protection of the forestry service are shown by the following extract: --&quot; A satisfactory decrease in the number of forest offences is recorded, only 47 cases arising, from which 45 convictions were obtained. A notice has been published confirming the conditions under which olive, carob, and other fruit trees may be pruned and felled,, and the wood sold.   Licences to the number of 189 were issued inGREAT BRITAIN.Unemployed Situation. The following summary of the situation is taken from, the special report on unemployment for the week ending 7th July, issued by the Ministry of Labour : Although there are signs in some divisions of a slight revival in the engineering-industry as the result of the termination of the recent dispute, the recovery is very gradual and employment is still far below normal. Some signs of activity in the shipbuilding industry are evident in the port of London area, but in the south-western division further discbarges have been recorded. In the north-eastern division activity is confined to repair work, while in the north-western division there are signs of improvement at the chief centres. In Scotland there is general depression. The improvement in repair work in Wales continues. From all divisions come reports of a marked depression in the coal-mining industry, due chiefly to the large supplies of coal on hand, coupled with an extraordinarily low demand. In the north-eastern division the demand for iron and steel is very low, and, although small quantities of iron are being shipped abroad, home trade is almost at a standstill.Trade is very quiet in the building industry, especially in the south-western division. In the south-western division some slight seasonal improvement in the boot and shoe industry has been recorded, and is expected to continue. The position in the clothing industry generally remains, unchanged, but in the south-western division some discharges have.occurred in the dressmaking and tailoring trades. The recent improvement recorded in the cotton industry steadily continues. In the north-eastern division the improvement in the woollen and worsted trades has been maintained, and it is reported that shoddy manufacturers are busy producing goods for export. In the Midlands the hosiery trade generally remains good, and in the lace trade some activity is reported, coupled with an improvement in tbe export trade. The Scottish linen industry continues to be active at Kirkcaidy, while the jute industry remains quiet.Depression continues at Bristol in the paper-making industry, but elsewhere there is little change to report. Although the pottery, china and earthenware industries remain depressed in the Midlands division there are signs of an increased steadiness at certain towns.In the south-eastern division considerable activity is reported in the seasonal trades of fruit-picking and jam-making. The fishing industry in Scotland shows a slight improvement, but employment is still only intermittent. In the north-eastern division the prospects are very poor owing to the large number of trawlers laid up for repair.
June. The closer control of olive felling is causing a considerable trade in imported wood fuel and charcoal from abroad, and, except in Phoenicia, local prices have risen slightly.&quot;The success of antiquarian research is reported in the following paragraphs : &quot;Forty historical sites, of which 17 were previously unrecorded, have been examined in the valley of the Jordan near Beisan. Some present evidence of great antiquity. The site of the biblical Ibleam (Iiileam) on the Canaanitish frontier has been determined.The Roman cities at Amman, Jerash and Umm Keis, east of the Jordan, have been inspected. They are to be classed among the finest monuments of antiquity in either area, with which Samaria alone is comparable; while the city of Jerash (ancient Gerasa) is unique both as to the extent and beauty of its classical remains.&quot;Regarding the development of commerce and industry during the month the report states: &quot; Trade conditions generally were dull, as is normal at this season. At; Haifa, retail markets improved somewhat during the moslem feasts. The political situation in Syria, however, is considered to be an obstacle to trade, and certain firms report a tnrnover of 30-35 per cent, less than in the two previous months.&quot; Certain newly started industries have experienced difficulty through insufficient provision of working, capital, of which the amount requisite is usually rmderestimated, although it should be considerably more in Palestine than in. more highly developed countries.&quot;The formation of two new companies is also reported : -&quot;A company, &apos; Athl.it Salt Enterprise,&apos; with a capital of  E.4,000, has been formed, for the purpose of producing salt from the Mediterranean at Athlit. A lease of the marshy land near Athlit has -been obtained from the Jewish Colonization Association, and draining begun. The scheme is of particular interest as the first attempt to start the salt industry in Palestine, and the ancillary operations should result in the conversion into a healthy zone of the malarial swamps.&quot;A company with a capital of  E.100,000 has been incorporated in Palestine under the name of 1 The Central Bank of Co-operative Institutions in Palestine, Ltd.&apos;, -with the aim of financing co-operative credit unions and other co-operative undertakings.&quot;Under the head of Customs it is stated that arrangements have been made with the Egyptian customs administration, whereby the examination of passengers and their baggage will be carried out at Kantara by the Egyptian Government on behalf of the Palestine Government. This will permit of one examination only being made, instead of two as at present.The following extracts give the statistics of immigration and travel: &quot; 2,793 travellers entered Palestine during May, and 1,960 left, including 137 Egyptian labourers, 154 emigrants (jews 56, christians 62, moslems 36), and 136 recently-arrived immigrants (jews 108, christians 17, moslems 11).&quot; 7.16 immigrants, of whom 704 were Jews, entered during the same period. Of the Jewish immigrants, 236 came from Poland and 30S from Rumania.&quot; 26 immigrants who failed to  comply with the regulations   were refused- admission.&quot;The report on the labour position is as follows :  &quot; The number of unemployed workmen is estimated to be 1,100. Almost all are unskilled or very slightly skilled. To these should, however, be added a few hundred men who are temporarily employed and also a larger number of men on short-time- employment.   There is a certain amount of building activity in prospect, which should absorb a considerable proportion of the workless, immediate or future.&quot; On the other hand, there is urgent need, for additional skilled workmen, especially in the building and carpentry trades, and endeavours are being made for the immigration of the numbers required.&quot; The month shows a further diminution in the number of Egyptian labourers employed by the Railways Department from. 229 to 176. Vacancies thus created are filled, so far as it is necessary to do so, by Palestinian labour.&quot;43-1 A 2
. Regarding the general conditions of public health, the report states :  &quot;The conditions of health in the country are remarkably good. There are no serious epidemics existing, and the incidence of malaria continues low.&quot;The opening of &quot; The Princess Mary Ward &quot; [B.E.R., lxxi,p. 3]in the Government hospital in Jerusalem was officially performed by the Acting High Commissioner on 21st June. &quot; The opening marks a further step in the Governments efforts to reduce the appallingly high infantile death rate in Palestine, by providing limited facilities for the training of midwives and for infant care.&quot;IRAQ.The following extracts are taken from the fourteenth Iraq Intelligence Report dated 15th July 1922 :-Anglo-Iraq Treaty - Pending reference to the Secretary of State of a further amendment of clause 18 of the treaty, negotiations, have made no progress. The King and the Council have, however, agreed to the condition laid down by the High Commissioner that no other amendment shall be proposed.Internal Order. The Minister of the Interior has telegraphed to Major Yetls, divisional adviser, Muntafiq, expressing the complete confidence of the King and the Iraq Government in him. Yasin Pasha, who has been appointed mutasarrif of the. Liwah, is working in perfect accord with the divisional adviser and showing wisdom and firmness in dealing with extremists and insurgents.Hostile Propaganda. Tbe arrival of reinforcements at Ruwauduz, accompanied by eliz Damir and other Turkish officers, who have reinstituted a sharp campaign of propaganda among the tribes, coupled with reports of a concentration at Van, have created a situation which is regarded with serious attention by the British general staff at Bagdad.   Rawanduz was intensively bombed on 10t.li and 11th July. .In Sulaimani, Karim FattaliBeg and Saiyid Muhammad Jabbari are still at large, but have not succeeded in gaining the support of the Shaikhan or the Kifri tribes. The Shaikhan leaders are pressing for the return of Shaikh Makmud as the only means of winning their continued sHipport. The disgruntled sections of the Pizhder, who are in touch with Rawanduz, back the movement and are causing Babakr Agba considerable anxiety. Pro-Shaikh Mahmud propaganda is also being carried on in Aurarnan, but is regarded with alarm By the free Begzadah. In British official circles there is a growing conviction that a solution of the Kurdish question cannot be delayed until peace is concluded with Turkey and that it will be necessary to establish a Ilukumdar in Sulaimani, controlled by British advisers. Saiyid Whithall of Neri has been suggested as a possible incumbent.The Syrian Border. The French are said to have agreed with the Kamalists that their frontier on the Tigris shall be Chamsharaf, about 10 miles south of Jazirab. Their recent activities on the Khabour are believed to have had as objective the occupation of Nisibin, which in the Angora agreement was placed in the French sphere. It would appear, however, that the Turks are not prepared to hand over the town.Ibn SaucVs Attitude. Danger of hostilities during the pilgrimage may be said to have vanished by reason of the statesmanlike measures taken by Ibn Sand to restrict the number of pilgrims and control their actions. His telegram to the High Commissioner announcing the nature of the precautions he has taken has given great satisfaction to King Husain and King.Faisal.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Radio Corporation of America [B.E.R., lxxiii, p. bp-On 20th July the Governor-General informed the Secrelary of State for the Colonies that his Ministers concurred in His Majesty s Governments proposal that it would be advisable to make represen-tations to the Japanese Government, in general terms, against their taking any action which might be prejudicial to direct communication through Canada between Japan and the United Kingdom or between Canada and Japan.
SOUTH AFRICA.Prorogation of Parliament-Oa 20th July the Governor-General reported to the -Secretary of State for the Colonies that Parliament had been prorogued on 19th July.The following items of information were telegraphed by ReuteFs agents: -The Session s Work in Parliament. The parliamentary session, which is drawing to a close, has since the first two months been devoted to the discussion of the hand, troubles, and has seen the enactment of a considerable amount of useful legislation. Among several measures designed to assist the fanning community is the Co-operative Societies Act, which is mainly intended to foster agricultural co-operation. The Iron and Steel Industry Encouragement Bill and the Electricity Bill are designed to promote industries which are replacing gold-mining, the latter being regarded as a diminishing factor, while a further act provides for the grading of export coal. There is, besides, the loan programme- for raising a sum of 10,000,000Z., mainly for railway, irrigation and afforestation schemes, which will afford work for the unem-ployed.In the course of a discussion of the Appropriation Bills in the Union House of Assembly, Mr. Burton, Minister of Finance, reviewing the financial situation, expressed himself as sanguine regarding tho financial recovery of the country, and added that he hoped to effect further economies which would wipe out the estimated budgetary deficit.- General Smuts expressed the belief that the country had passed through the worst phase of depression and unemployment.Mr. dagger, Minister of Railways and Harbours, stated that the railways had apparently reached the equilibrium point. The loss of revenue through the strike had exceeded expectation, but the stringent economies which had been enforced were bearing fruit.General Smuts, replying to an appeal, by Colonel Creswell, who has just returned to Parliament as Labour member for Stamford Hill, for an amnesty for prisoners awaiting trial on the Rand, argued that it would be a mistake, after lesser offenders had been dealt with by the magistrates, that the courts should show clemency towards the ringleaders before they had stood trial.   [Capetown, 19th July.]The Hottentot Revolt. General Smuts, in an interview with ReuteFs represen-tative, to-day emphatically denied the allegations of Mr. John H. Harris in a London newspaper alleging that the suppression of the recent Hottentot revolt was characterized by cruelty, and expressing a hope that the Council of the League of Nations would secure from General Smuts the promise of a full and impartial enquiry. General Smuts declared that the operations for the suppression of the rising were conducted with great humanity, and there was no ground whatever for any such allegations. General Smuts stated that Mr. Hofmeyr, the Administrator of the South West Territory, had made a report on the question, and that the Govern-ment had appointed a commission to euquire still further into the matter. Both these reports would be sent to the Council of the League of Nations. General Smuts repeated that there Avas no need for anxiety as regards the treatment of the natives. ^Capetown, 18th July.]Speaking on the same subject in the Union House of Assembly, General Smuts said that unrest existed both north and south of the Orange river. The Government had, therefore, decided to send a Native Affairs Commission to investigate the situation. The Prime Minister complimented the Administrator of South-West Africa, Mr. Hofmeyr, upon nipping the rebellion in the bud, and thereby averting a much more serious state of affairs. He declared that the Administrator^ report had entirely -disposed of the allegations of ill-treatment of prisoners.   [Capetown, 19th July.]General Smuts on the International Status of Dominions. Bills embodying the Washington treaties were ratified by the Union House of Assembly to-day. In moving their adoption, General Smuts emphasized the importance of the stand made by South Afripa, which had resulted in the United States conceding the recognition -of Dominion status. Although he could not say all difficulty had been removed regarding the form of South Africa-s status, yet the international status of the British Dominions was fully recognized by all the Great Powers, and South Africa might claim that her stand on a critical occasion had contributed very solidly to that result.  Capetown, 19th July.]
Wireless. General Smuts made a statement on the wireless position in the-union House of Assembly this afternoon. The Government was, the Premier said, in possession of three schemes, namely, Marconfs, ElwelPs and that of the British Post Office. The El well proposal was based on the Poulsen arc system, which the British Government was abandoning. The British proposal, involving, as it did, a state-built and state-operated station, was open to certain objections, including difficulties, of finance and of keeping the service up-to-date. General Smuts enumerated many advantages of the Marconi offer, which provided for the formation of a South African Company with a capital of half a million sterling, of which the Marconi Company of&quot; England was prepared to subscribe four-fifths, while one-fifth was to be subscribed in South Africa. The Union Government was to nominate one director. Of the capital, 400,0001. would be devoted to the erection of a wireless station of the vacuum tube type, which was now recommended by the British authorities and had already been adopted in Australia. This station would be capable of speaking with every continent and Marconi&apos;s would instal fresh patents from time to time. Marconi&apos;s were not asking for a monopoly, and the Government would have the right to expropriate the company or renew its licence every 10 years. The Government, General Smuts concluded, had not yet taken a final decision, but at present the arguments were strongly in favour of the Marconi offer..   [Capetown, 19th July.]The Mining Industry. The Mining Industry Board, appointed in March last after the Rand rebellion to consider principally methods of effecting economies and enhancing efficiency and the desirability or otherwise of regulating the ratio of European and native labour in the mines, in now concluding the first phase of its labours Up to now, the Board, which consists of Justice Sir William Solomon, Mr. William Brace, Labour Adviser to the British Department of Mines, Sir Robert Kotze, Government mining engineer, and&apos;Sir Carruthers Beattie, Principal of Cape Town University, has held 55 meetings.It will adjourn shortly for a conference between representatives of the gold and coal-mining industries and other large employers of labour and representatives of the trade unions which is to begin on 8th August for the purpose of considering the best means of promoting conciliation. The Board which has arranged this conference will subsequently occupy itself with the latteFs report.   [Capetown, 22nd July.]Employers&apos; Tax in the Transvaal. The Provincial Council to-day rejected the Governments offer for a loan of 200,0001. on condition that the Employers&apos; Tax was dropped. The Nationalists described the offer as a bribe and declared the Government was seeking to protect the mining magnates and rich merchants. The Employers&apos; Tax, which was recently rushed through the Council, imposes a levy of 1L per head on. every person employed over eight.   [Pretoria, 27th July.]
