GREAT BRITAIN.Cabinet Unemployment Committee [B.E.E., lvi, p. 2]. The following is taken from the report of the Ministry of Labour on unemployment for 11th November : . Before rising for the recess, the Cabinet agreed that the position with regard to unemployment was so serious that the Cabinet Unemployment Committee must devote special attention to it, with special reference to the exhaustion of benefit under the unemployment insurance Acts.On the 19th August 1921 the Cabinet, on the recommendation of the committee, agreed that assistance could be given to local poor law authorities, either by way of expediting the sanction for loans or permitting the loans to be spread over a number of years, in cases in which the local authority could prove that there were exceptional circumstances due to the abnormal unemployment and that they were exercising their powers with due care and discretion.The whole matter was again discussed at.the Cabinet which met at Inverness on the 7th September 1921.On the 16th September 1921 the Cabinet committee further agreed that: (I) Where, for the purpose of providing employment in the present emergency, local authorities (including statutory bodies who do not trade for profit) put in hand or accelerate approved works (other than revenue-producing works), which would not otherwise have been proceeded with, or so accelerated at the present time, the State will give financial assistance on the following basis.Grants equal to 50 per cent, of the interest and sinking fund charges on loans raised by local authorities to meet expenditure on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January 1922 will be paid by the State for a period of one-half the term of the loans subject to a maximum of 15 years. The expenditure to be taken into account will be all approved expenditure incurred within the period ending the 31st March 1923.In approving schemes, special regard will be had to the direct employment of unemployed persons and to a preference being given to ex-service men.(2) In the case of revenue-producing works, grants will be paid, in approved cases, equivalent to 50 per cent, of the interest on. loans, raised for a period of not less than 10 years, in respect of expenditure on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January 1922, provided that such expenditure is incurred within the period ending the 31st March 1923. These interest grants will be paid for a period of live years.(3) Schemes shall not be authorised exceeding a total capital expenditure of 10 millions without consultation between the Minister of Health and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(4) Schemes must be approved by the Ministry of Health or other appropriate government department as schemes which will provide employment, and must be certified by the Ministry of Labour for districts where unemployment is severe.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.The Situation. On 17th November Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 629] the text of a communication he had received from the British Advisers to the Government of Egypt. The gist of this wras as follows. Any decision which maintained the protectorate and did not admit the principle of independence would bring about administrative chaos with a serious risk of revolution. The whole structure of the Government was Egyptian and it was impossible to exercise any British control without full Egyptian co-operation. It would be impossible to form a Ministry unless His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to give substantial satisfaction to the expectations which Egyptians had legitimately formed during the past two years.
Eventually there would be a strike among Government officials or organized obstruction; and the army would probably side with the majority. The British Advisers had been carrying on for two years and more in the belief that a policy of liberal concessions would be adopted, and had given this impression to Ministers and others with whom they had been in contact. If a liberal programme were approved, even if no Egyptian Minister was prepared to accept it as a full satisfaction of Egyptaiu claims, they were confident that a Ministry could be formed to carry it &apos; out and it could be elaborated on the spot.In reply to this Lord Curzon on 18th November instructed [No. 503] Lord Allenby to point out to the advisers that in describing the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government as not admitting the principle of Egyptian independence and as maintaining the protectorate they were proceeding in ignorance of what had been proposed ; an error which to a large extent vitiated their reasoning.IRAQ.King FeisaVs Popularity.---The following telegram [No. 635] was sent to the -Secretary of State for the Colonies by the High Commissioner for Iraq on 1st November:  FeisaPs tour to Hillah, the holy places, and southern Shamiyah has been no less brilliantly successful than his Mosul visit. The&apos;reception at llillah was -attended by ail the tribal and urban notabilities, while the presence of the first battalion of the national army completed the picture formed by the local patriots&apos; enthusiasm. At Karbela the royal progress to the shrine is said to have surpassed any previous demonstration of the sort, not excluding the visit of Nasir Uddin, Shah of Persia. Returning to Hillah, the King lunched with the officers of the Iraq army. The King proceeded next da;^ to Diwanyah and Rumaitha. The warmth of his reception at Rumaitha surprised even his most ardent adherents. His own report is that the Euphrates tribes will prove much easier to handle than the tribes of Syria. He has undoubtedly scored a personal success amongst them.The French Treaty with Angora. On 12th November the High Commissioner for Iraq reported [No 667] as&apos;foll.ows :  The news of the French treaty with Angora has caused a good deal of alarm to King Feisal and all the intelligent lraqi.es here except the pro-Turkish elements. In a letter to me to-day the King recalls that he repeatedly warned His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment when in London of the danger involved to Iraq in the conclusion of such a treaty which was even then rumoured. Now that it has come about he points out emphatically the menace involved and the impetus which the treaty is sure to give to the Turkish aims and propaganda against Iraq,, and presses urgently for a definite pronouncement of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government and a clear reply on the problem of defence already referred to you.I do my best, of course, to discourage premature apprehension, but we cannot wonder at their uneasiness.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., Ivi, p. 3]. The Viceroy telegraphed [2015] on 9th November that he had received reports of a few minor incidents of enemy activity. Protection troops to the south of Rogha Not had been attacked by a party of about 50, resulting in casualties among our Indian troops of three killed and two wounded.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., Ivi, p. 3].-Telegraphing [2508 S.] on 4th November the Viceroy transmitted a message from Sir Henry Dobbs suggesting the remote possibility that the Amir, finding himself obliged to choose between a friendship treaty-conditional on disclosure of the Russian secret clauses, a neighbourly treaty with -exchange of Ministers, and complete rupture, might of his own accord revert to an exclusive treaty with its concomitant conditions.   Our knowledge that the Russians
had failed in their promise to deliver arms, and that there were other causes of friction, induced Sir Henry lo wish to be prepared for such a contingency in.order to avoid delay. He desired instructions, although he presumed he should accept an offer on these lines.The Viceroy stated that he had repeated the telegram [5030] from the Secretary of State of 3rd November, informing Sir Henry that he had a free hand to&apos;act under the directions contained therein, always bearing in mind the anxiety of the Government of India to avoid open rupture.Regarding the hypothetical case put, forward in Sir Henry&apos;a message, the Viceroy expressed his inability to give instructions to cover it, in view of the resultant danger of provocation to Russia.A telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs, transmitted [2520 S.j by the Viceroy on 7th November, reported that while the foregoing telegram was being decypherod the Amir had sent for him and had given him a private reception. The Amir complained of the difficulties arising out of the long delay, and spoke of his inability to continue m such a state of uncertainty. He also dilated at length on the tribal question, which he said was causing him great trouble. Eventually he arranged to see Sir Henry again on the evening of the 7th November.In a message transmitted [2533 S.] by the Viceroy on .10th November, Sir Henry Dobbs reported an interview with the Amir on the night of the Hh, which had resulted in a complete impasse. After lengthy arguments and. explanations of his difficulty in adopting a definite policy either towards the Russians, the British, or the frontier tribes, the Amir declared for a free hand, which would preclude him from accepting either a neighbourly treaty as modified or an adjournment. He acknow-ledged the dangerous nature of the Russian influence which had permeated his Ministries and his own household, but said he could make no way against it without adequate offers from the British, lie now proposed to expel the Russian Minister and to reduce his relations with Russia to those of ,&apos;bare neighbourliness on the conditions (.1) an increase in the amount of munitions in the event of cessation of relations with Russia ; (2) sufficient time to transport arms and troops to the Russian frontier, in anticipation of an attack by Russia on his denunciation of the treaty.Sir Henry has replied that the immediate consideration of an exclusive treaty with us was impossible in the present circumstances, and that in any case the time condition as to the delivery of arms had not commended itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government, Sir Henry added,, however, that he was authorized to assure him that, in the event of some arrangement for friendly or even neighbourly relations being then made, and of the Amir subsequently finding it necessary to shake off his Russian -engagements and to turn to the British Government, life could count oil their full support, should such a decision bring on a Russian attack.In continuation of this message Sir Henry Dobbs reported that the Amir had finally said that it was useless to continue the argument, and that while regretting the continued divergence of views between them, he must have his hands free to pursue a policy of complete and exclusive friendship with Russia. The Amir proposed that Sir Henry should officially communicate the. final views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in a formal official meeting with Tarsi, and that he should take his departure on 13th November. To this, Sir Henry had agreed, and reported that he might be expected to arrive at Peshawar on 15th November.The Viceroy endorsed Sir !leury&apos;s action, and, agreed that, unless the Amir changed his mind at the last moment, there was nothing else to be done.Under telegram [2514-S.] from the Viceroy, dated 12th November, Sir Henry Dobbs reported that Tarsi had signified, his inability to meet him on the named date, and that in consequence the. meeting would take place on the 13th November, and his departure would be deferred until the 14th November.Telegraphing [2553 S.] on 13th November, the Viceroy transmitted a message from Sir Henry Dobbs of the. previous day&apos;s date, in which the latter related an interview with the Amir on that&apos; day, which was eventually adjourned by the Amir until the 13th November. In this interview the Amir, after urging acceptance of his proposal regarding breaking with Russia, pleadetl hard for money, and although he professed to be discussing the &quot;gentlemanly treaty&quot; merely with the object of condemning it, it appeared to Sir Henry that there was a distant chance of his accepting it.
Sir Henry&apos;s &quot;message, transmitted [2559 S.] by the Viceroy ou 14-th November, reported the upshot of his meeting with the Amir on the evening of the &apos;13th; This had lasted for live hours, and the Amir had accepted many provisions which Sir Henry had put before him on the previous day, and, moreover, appeared to be reconciled to the idea of getting no money. Sir Henry, however, did not place much faith oh that. He had agreed to the Afghan representative with the Viceroy being designated consul-general instead of envoy, ami thought that things looked more hopeful. In any case his departure had ,t,0 be delayed for a day or two.On 15th November Sir Henry Dobbs reported [25GG S.] that the Amir had sent him revised draft clauses, but that these had been received so late that further discussion had been deferred until that day.A later telegram of the same date was transmitted [2575 S.] by the Viceroy on 16th November. In this Sir Henry Dobbs reported that after .11 hours&apos; private discussion the Amir had accepted a neighbourly treaty. He had expatiated on the difficulty of persuading his councillors to agree, in the absence of financial assistance, but was confident that he would get it through in three or four days&apos; time. He wound up with a speech expressing his wish to show as great a friendship to the British Government as his father or grandfather, and his intention to pursue a steady policy of breaking with Russia and making a very close friendship with Great. Britain.The Viceroys Report. The following telegrams were sent on the 9th and 18th November :-I. (9th November.) Section I. Punjab. Agitators have greatly increased their activities, and largely attended public meetings have been of almost daily occurrence in Lahore, where the closest possible connexion exists between the congress and caliphate committees and the various Sikh organizations. The speeches are usually extremely bitter in tone, but the class of those attending is deteriorating. Commercial men and citizens of good status are rarely seen at the meetings, and for several mouths the local bar has abstained from agitation. Some waning of popular interest is indicated by the difficulty experienced in filling the vacancies in the ranks of the Lahore congress volunteers.   The manifesto of 4th October has failed.The meeting of the provincial Sikh league, at Lyallpur was marked by very violent speeches. The league is now a body of extreme non-co-operators. The delivery of the judgement in the Nankana case appears to have been quietly received.Section 2. Only one resignation of a minor official has been reported. The commissioner of dullundur, a brahmin, considers that the belief that the Govern-ment is bitterly opposed to the caliphate is permeating to some extent all classes of mohamedans. The. Akali movement continues prominent, and it is freely said that recruits are being raised for purpose of . seizing the gurdwaras, especially those with substantial incomes. At least one shrine has recently been seized by the Akalis. :       v .Section 3. Madras.-There has been-a distinct lull in political activity since Gandhi left the presidency at the beginning of October. The number of meetings and speeches has been much reduced. The effect produced by arrest of the caliphate leaders is almost negligible. In some districts non-co-operation has taken the form of disobedience to the forest regulations. In Guntur the police had to disperse, the crowd endeavouring to rescue cattle seized for illegal grazing.Section 4. The visit of H.M.S. Comus to Canada (sic) and the inarch of the landing party through the bazar had a good effect.Section 5. Bombay.&apos; There has been some increase in the number of meetings held, apparently as the result of the trial of the caliphate leaders. At many meetings, the sixth Karachi resolution was reaffirmed, though in most instances it was watered down, but the boycott of foreign cloth was given a more prominent place. The commissioner in Sind considers that the continuance of the war between Greece and Angora is the main factor in keeping alive the caliphate agitation, and is making the task of officials increasingly difficult. He thinks it quite possible that before long there may be a considerable number of resignations of niohamedau government employees in Sind. On the other hand, the events in Malabar have given a distinct set-back to the sympathy ofhiudus with the caliphate agitation. The commissioner of police, Bombay, reports that resolutions regarding the boycott of thei?rihce&apos;s visit, reported to have been,passed by the congress working committee,
at its meeting on 5th October, were not in fact passed, but that there was only-some informal discussion on this subject. There was no unanimity, and Gandhi eventually entrusted Moti Lai Nehru with the duty of drafting resolutions to be supplied to the All-India committee for approval. The resolutions were apparently drafted by Moti Lai Nehru after his return to Allahabad and communicated to the press as having been passed, but were not passed in Bombay and were not even seen by members.Section G. Bengal.- Apart from the How rah riot, the political situation continues quiet, though there have been violent speeches indicating a desire to prepare the ground for civil disobedience. The arrest of the Ali brothers has created little excitement, though attempts have been made at meetings in most districts to make capital out of it. The boycott of foreign cloth led to increased sale of country material at Pujas, but the measures adopted to frustrate violence and intimidation have proved fairly&apos;, successful. Some of the Calcutta Marwaris who signed the undertaking to place no fresh orders for foreign&apos;cloth until next. February have already contravened them.Section 7. There is no indication that the non-co-operation movement has seriously affected the loyalty of either civil or police officers. There have been no recent resignations in these services on this ground, and the general body of the Calcutta police remains loyal, though one head constable and 13 constables, mostly recent recruits, have resigned the service since the issue of the manifesto.Section 8.. The conviction of J. MY Sen Gupta, in Chittagong, led to a slight disturbance, which was greatly exaggerated in the local press. The refusal, in Midnapore and the adjoining districts to pay the union boarcPs taxes has been spreading. This matter is receiving careful attention. . The tramway strike has.no political significance.Section 9. The local political leaders, in particular C. R. Das, are fast losing influence. Das&apos;s levy of forced subscriptions has greatly contributed to destroy faith in non-co-operation. After their experience of the Assam-Bengal railway strike, non-co-operators seem to be shy of interfering in labour questions..Section 10. For instance, C. R. Dass (? Das) during a recent visit to Asansol, made no attempt to disturb the labour conditions in the collieries. It remains to be seen, however, what the result will be of the coming trade unions congress meeting at Jherria. Apprehensions have been expressed locally that attempts to promote a strike will be made within the next few months.Section -11. United Provinces. Reaffirmations of the Karachi resolutions continue, and considerable extremist activity is directed towards seducing govern-ment servants from their duty, especially in the case of the police. A. few resignations of the hitter had been reported. The majority of them were bad. bargains and had recently been in trouble.Section 12. The objectionable fatwa has been widely distributed iii places. The proclamation pillar (sic) medallions of King Edward and King George, and the statue of Queen Victoria at Allahabad have been disfigured. A. reward of Us. 5,000 has been offered for information leading to the discovery of tho authors. Other local Govern-- merits have been informed with a view to precautions being taken. ;Section 13. The commissioners of Lucknow and Fyzabad report that the Oudh Rent Bill attracts little attention amongst the genuine Oudli tenantry, The liberal league agitators are unable to raise meetings of the tenantry. The large landless class in the congested districts of southern Oudh, which provide the agitator with his most inflammable material, are not affected in either direction.Central Provinces. There has been some revival of political agitation. Meetings --have been held to reaffirm the Karachi resolutions. Copies of the fatwa are reported to have been distributed in some places. . Caliphate agitators, however, though prepared to pass the Karachi resolutions, are not taking active steps to give it effect. The only resignations so far attributed to Gandhi&apos;s manifesto are those of a mohamedaii head constable and two clerks. The boycott of foreign cloth has had. little effect. - The organization, of volunteers is, receiving attention, and there is a distinct jnovement of preparation for civil disobedience in a few districts. The split between the foUowers of Gandhi and those of Tilak continues, but it is doubtful whether it will develop into a rupture.Section 14. Assam. There has been a crop of objectionable caliphate speeches in Sylhet, The chief offender is being prosecuted under sections 124a. and 505, Indian Penal Code, and one or two other pnosecutions are impending.   The more
-objectionable forms of picketing have been stopped by the use of section 144, Criminal Procedure Code!Section 15. Out of 14 caliphate committees in the Sylhet district, only one is working. Although rules have been printed for the formation of volunteer corps, no -further steps in this direction have been taken,Delhi. Funds appear to be running short in local extremist circles, and.charges -of embezzlement are becoming more insistent. There has been no picketing of cloth -or liquor shops, and some slight revival of business in the piece-goods trade is reported. Though there has been much talk of intimidation and the boycott of indi-vidual police officers, no very gross overt act lias so far occurred.Section 1(5. The rural Aman sabhas are progressing steadily. Telegraphic reports have been received of serious trouble, resulting in the burning of the Chauturwa factory in Champaran have been communicated separately.Section 17. Bihar. Agitation has increased in the Tirhoot division, especially the Champaran. district, though elsewhere there has been a lull. In Champaran, deliberate attempts are being made to organize and excite public feeling against Europeans, a significant instance being the determined effort to boycott the established bazaars by starting rival bazaars close to the oldest markets run by the factories. In most cases, force and threats are used to persuade shopkeepers to move to the new site. This movement is being dealt with by action under section 14-1, Code of Criminal Procedure, the local Government is considering the proposal to apply the Seditious Meetings Act-to Champaran district, - &apos;. ,.Section 18. North-West Frontier Province. -The political situation is satisfactory in the main.Section 19. The situation has deteriorated in. the Mozufferpore district, especially Sitamarhi, where the district magistrate regards the situation as very difficult, and has applied for additional police. The local Government was asked to report what steps were being taken for the protection of Europeans, and has since reported that the police forces have been strengthened in the area affected. The caliphate and non-co-operation propaganda has had little of no effect on the moral of the police force, or in obtaining resignations.Section 20. At a meeting of the central caliphate committee, held in Delhi on 3rd November,- a heated debate was started by a hindu member regarding the attitude of caliphate leaders towards the Moplah rebellion, and the alleged tendency of moslems towards violence. The report of the debate discloses serious appre-apprehensions on the part of the hindus, especially in Sind. Ajnial Khan and Abdul Kalani Azad assured the hindu members that they would ask all mohamedaiis to observe non-violence, but could, give no further assurance.General.-Gaudhi s &quot; manifesto &quot; has fallen flat, and the number of resignations from the government service reported is almost negligible. It is too early yet to judge the. effect of the sentences passed on the caliphate leaders, which have only just been announced, but there are indications of increasing unrest in some provinces. Gandhi is, at the moment, attending the meeting, of the All-India congress committee in Delhi.Telegraphing again on the same day the Viceroy said that they had received a further report from the Bombay Government in regard to mohamedan feeling in Sind. :-The commissioner in Sind states that Mohamed ail feeling in Sind. is growing steadily more bitter; that the Turkish and caliphate questions are ousting non-co-operation on Gandhi lines ; and that, unless they are settled to the satisfaction of the more moderate side of mussulman opinion, there will, sooner or later, be&apos; outbreaks of disorder and serious bloodshed. We entertain no-doubt that this is a fair interpretation of the situation. We have repeatedly&apos;urged that a settle-ment satisfactory to moderate mohamedan opinion in regard to Thrace and Smyrna&apos; is absolutely necessary if serious trouble among the mohamedans is to be averted, and that nothing would do more to break up the present artificial hindu-mohamedan entonle, and, generally, [to alter for good the whole political position in India. We are aware of and grateful for the efforts which you have made in this direction, but, in view of the rapidly increasing embittermeut of Indian mohamedans we are compelled to urge, with all the emphasis at our command, that the gravity of the niohamedan situation, and the imperative need of conciliating mohamedan opinion by concessions in regard to. Thrace and Smyrna, should be
represented afresh do His Majesty&apos;s Government. Our position, we would add, has-been rendered still more difficult by the universal belief among mohamedans that England alone liars the way to a satisfactory solution. We have clone what we could ,-to counter this impression, and have given wide publicity to the recent questions and answers in Parliament, on the subject of Franeo-Kemalist negotiations, but we doubt if these statements wall carry conviction, more particularly in view of the statements that have just been published regarding the light in which -the Foreign Office views that agreement. Finally, while our direct concern is only with the Indian aspect of the Turkish problem; we venture to express our belief that no other&apos; interests involved are, or can be, of as great importance as the appeasement of the 70,000,000 mohamedans in India, and the consequent relief to a situation which literally is of the gravest danger to the wdiole Indian Empire.II. (18th November.) Section 1. Bombay. Political agitation continues, the-main themes at the meetings being the re-affirmation of the Karachi - resolutions in various forms and the boycott of foreign cloth. Several instances have occurred of persons under trial for sedition offering unqualified apologies to secure proceedings being dropped. The &quot; manifesto&quot; by Gandhi and others has not apparently resulted in any resignations from -the government service, either military or civil, but a few resignations of (V- subordinates) have been tendered on the ground of the arrest of the AH brothers, the caliphate or Punjab wrongs.Section 2. Copies of the proscribed fatwa have been distributed in Bombay,, and posted up in Ahmedabad ; and reports from Sind indicate haphazard attempts to-circulate ithein among tlie troops.Section 3. The Bombay Government reported on the 16th that there Avas a possibility of a strike of electric workers in Bombay and asked for our sanction to-employ the,assistance of the troops, if necessary, in view of the Prince of Wales&apos; visit.&quot;: We have agreed.Section 4-. No official reports as to the arrival of the Prince of Wales have been received, but the press reports indicate that he was given a cordial welcome by large crowds. While the triumphant progress of the. Prince of Wales was not marred by any incident, a non-co-operation agitation in the northern part of the city led to a serious disturbance and fighting between.the rioters and the police, resulting in four-deaths and 13 injured among the police, and three killed and several injured among the rioters. Several rioters were arrested. The situation is now under control. Mobs, have retired and the police and the military are patrolling the affected areas. The causes of the riot were the.rowdy elements, who-would not brook any traffic running; or business being transacted, and were molesting Europeans and all those dressed in English costume. When the big meeting where Gandhi had exhorted all to remain non-violent was over, the crowd began to move towards the town in different directions. Among these, idie mill hands started rowdyism on a large scale. They forcibly stopped all traffic, including several of those cars which were returning after the Prince&apos;s reception. The mob, finding the police engaged along the royal route,, got further impetus to their nefarious activities and, at the corner of Grant Road and Parel Road, stopped five tramcars and, after clearing them of passengers, completely destroyed three of them by fire. The police &quot;were soon on the spot, and were reinforced by the military. Fighting continued for some hours. One big liquor shop was. completely burnt. Gandhi and others are reported to have gone to the affected area, but the mob was so much excited that they could hardly get a hearing.Section 5. Sind. The district magistrate at Karachi reports that the recra-f-descence of excitement over the caliphate question in Bind is caused by a general feeling that to be loyal to the Government is to betray Islam. The sincerity of the-British Government in its attitude towards Turkey is doubted. Even government officials are becoming doubtful whether loyalty to the Crown is worth anything in face-of religious fanaticism. Unless his Majesty&apos;s Government realize that terms must be made with Turkey which will satisfy her and reasonable Mohamedan opinion,, government officials will, not be able to prevent a debacle against the Government in Sind.Section 6.   It.is significant that a motion to postpone the voting of the grant for the Prince of Wales&apos; visit was carried in a hitherto loyal municipality, such as Karachi, which has only 10 non-co-operators on the board.Section 7. The Commissioner in Sind, commenting on the above, considers the district magistrate^ view not unduly alarmist,   In the commissioner&apos;s opinion, unless-
the Turkish question is soon satisfactorily settled, and mohamedan opinion again conciliated, there will be very serious trouble in Sind, Gandhis desecration (sic) doctrines are thoroughly disliked by the majority of&quot; mohamedans, but religious feeling is being strongly aroused, and people are being driven by it into the non-co-operative camp.Section 8. North-West. Frontier Province.--A small meeting of 200 people at Dehra Ismail Khan reaffirmed the Karachi resolutions. The leaders were proceeded against under section 40, Frontier Crimes Regulations. Two have been placed on security, and six have been sentenced to two years&apos; imprisonment, having refused to furnish security.   The chief commissioner has proceeded there on tour.&apos;Section 9. The trial of the Ali brothers and the Gandhi &quot; manifesto &quot; have. produced little effect.Delhi. The meetings of the All-India caliphate and congress committees in the first fortnight of November do not seem to have aroused much local interest. Gandhis reception was not enthusiastic. The campaign against foreign cloth has not been successful, and Gandhi&apos;s address to the cloth merchants was a fiasco, only ten out of some hundreds agreeing to accept his views.Section 10. At the same time shops were closed here yesterday, hartal having been declared on the date of the arrival of His Royal Highness, arid the activities of the volunteers are becoming marked. The chief commissioner will submit a special report on the subject shortly. Two assaults on C.I.D. officers have, been reported during the fortnight, and are being investigated. Congress volunteers continue to attract attention and, on 3rd November, made a route march through the city, with flags flying and the band to advertise hindu sabha meetings.Section II. Their upkeep is, however, expensive, and there are rumours that.tho personnel may be reduced, Co-operative sabhas in the surrounding country continue to progress. Rural notables evidently realize that non-co-operation spells ruin for themselves. The movement is spontaneous and (V entirely) directed by (? powerful) leaders of rural opinion.Punjab.--The Sikh situation gives ground for considerable anxiety.Section.12. On 29th October the gurdwara prabandhak committee at Amritsar passed a resolution demanding that the keys of the Golden Temple treasury should be given by the manager, who is appointed by the local Government, to the president of the committee. As the committee has no lawful authority to control the Golden Temple or its treasure, the deputy commissioner, on instructions from the local Government, called upon the manager to deliver the keys to him. The manager made over the keys in obedience to this demand, and they have been deposited in the government treasury for safe custody. The local Government, in a communique published on the .11th November, stated these facts and explained that it was its object to divest itself, in a lawful manner, by the institution of a suit for the settle-ment of a scheme of management, of all responsibility of the Golden Temple. The keys had been deposited in the treasury because there was good reason to suppose that they were likely to be seized by a body not lawfully entitled to their possession. They will be held only until the orders of a competent court, have been passed upon the suit which will be instituted for the settlement, of a scheme of management. In consequence of this, occurrence, the gurdwara committee summoned the A akali jathas to Amritsar, aud by the afternoon of the 12th some 5,000 had arrived. The A kalis are said to have been in a defiant mood, and many were,armed with kirpaus, battle axes and sticks. They included, many returned emigrants and a large number of ex-soldiers. Owing to their turbulent character and generally unsatisfactory attitude, there is some apprehension of a collision with the authorities. The local Government have appointed a retired Sikh military officer to succeed the former manager of the Golden Temple. He visited the temple on the 15th of November, and informed the Akalis and the representatives of the gurdwara committee that the decorations used on Guru Nanalps-birthday could, be taken out as usual; but it is said that armed Akalis were placed in front of the treasury, and the manager was denied admittance, abused and insulted. The working committee of the gurdwara committee wrote to the manager demanding his appearance before the Akal takht, to apologize under pain of ex-communication.Section 13 A C.I.D. report, referring to the resolution passed by the Sikh leader regarding service in the army, mentions that the Sikh sepoys are prepared to leave their regiments in. fairly large numbers, and that there is a similar tendency on 34-4 V.

Among the most serious factors at work are the bitterness of the caliphate agitation, particularly in Sind and Bengal; the (?

To His Majesty&apos;s Government these documents seem to be, in letter as well as in spirit, in contradiction both to the treaty engagements of the Allies and to the policy of close understanding and mutual co-operation upon which it was believed that the three great Powers had agreed to proceed for the early settlement of the Middle and the Near East.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at once saw the French Ambassador and has addressed to the French Government a series of important questions, their reply to which is awaited.The cordial co-operation of the Italian Government in the attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government may have to assume is being invited.The concessions which Prance has obtained, whether economic or otherwise, appear to extend beyond the zone allotted to her in the tripartite agreement, while the Angora agreements general character bears the appearance of a treaty concluded with an enemy by one of the Allies without the knowledge of the others, and seems tantamount to the recognition as the Government of Turkey of the Angora National Assembly. As soon as possible after receipt, the substance of the French reply will be sent to you.   *AUSTRALIA.Zinc Industry. The following telegram .was sent by the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 12th November : My Ministers again urge that favourable consideration be given to the revival of the British Government offer in September 191(1 to advance 500.000J. as a loan to assist the&apos;zinc industry in Australia, subject to (this) condition previously propounded, namely: (a; that the Government of the . Commonwealth of Australia should be satisfied that the processes owned by the individual companies claiming assistance are effective; (h) that the companies concerned should be possessed of their own .. sources of raw materials ; and (c) that the companies should possess works of their --own. The Prime Minister states that at the time the agreement was made it was not understood that it was a war measure only; that the negotiations with interested parties in Australia were necessarily protracted ; and that he is now being pressed to -carry out the obligation entered into.Meat. On 12th November the Governor-General transmitted the following-telegram from his Prime Minister : Australian interests are greatly jeopardized and great loss is resulting from the present position of the frozen meat export trade. Apparently the chief reasons for the glut on the London market are th-e accumulation of stocks by the British Govern-ment during the latter years of the war period, together with the shortage of freight
in 1917-18, resulting in an accumulation in Australia -and New  Zealand, and competition from American and Argentine beef.   As you are doubtless aware, the supply of American and Argentine meat is directly controlled by the Beef Trust of America, and the activities of the trust in Great&apos;-Britain have greatly contributed to the placing of the Australian trade in. the present critical position.   The British Government has certainly made no distinction in favour of Empire-grown meat; and British overseas growers have been unable to meet tire competition of the trust, -which had equal facilities extended to it in the British market,    The sale of /Australian frozen meat is further jeopardized by the  arbitrary price fixed  by the British Government in order to assist local raisers;   this :has kept  prices high and  a  restricted consumption.    The effect of the  control. :price was a preference to local meats, which shut out markets to-Australia.   As we supplied our meat to Britain, at a fair price when meat was scarce and -we could reason-ably have secured more, we are surely entitled to some consideration now.   With a view to the alleviation   of the position, which  is  rapidly becoming  critical  in this country, it would greatly help if the British Government could dispose of its accumulated stocks at the earliest possible date with a view to allowing present and forthcoming supplies to be put on the market with a reasonable profit.   In this connexion I desire to emphasize that  Australian  meat was  not  bought  at an extravagant price during the war; on the contrary, the contract price to the British Government was considerably below what the Argentine producers were able to get on a free market in England.   The clearing of: all old stocks will have the two-fold advantage of bringing the quantity available for sale within a reasonable compass and providing room for the shipment of fresh meat.   The paragraph re freight, as you are aware, is a matter of paramount importance in connexion with this industry, and at present the- Common wealth and New Zealand are disaclvantagedin comparison -with the Argentine.   I desire to enlist your best&apos;services with-a view to a substantial reduction.   If possible to bring the Government of New Zealand into line, would the British Government seriously consider the matter of the contribution of \i. peril), with an equivalent Commonwealth contribution, at the same, time pressing the shipping companies to make a further rebate of \4. -per lb. in consideration of the Government subsidy?   I approach, you the more confidently as the present acute position, here was brought about mainly by the supply of this commodity !to the British Government during the war period.   I should be grateful, if the above proposals could receive sympathetic consideration.The following paragraphs were issued from the office of the High Commissioner in London on 21st November : The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; on Immigrants: The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. W. M. Hughes, condemns in the strongest terms the pernicious character of a recent statement in the London Daily Herald suggesting that able-bodied immigrants to Australia are not wanted for industrial but for militarist purposes. Mr. Hughes points out that Australian national sentiment is strongly non-militarist and has sent to the British delegation at Washington a representative who emphatically favours dis-armament, and who has an absolutely free hand to act for Australia. Evidence of Australia^ true view-point was recorded at the recent conference of Australian Premiers at Melbourne, when Mr. Dooloy and Mr. Theodore, Premiers of the State Labour Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, were in accord with a unanimous resolution favouring a vigorous immigration policy with land settlement as its definite objective. The Prime Minister added that it was sufficient to point this out as a most emphatic refutation of the London labour journals wild and irresponsible and iniquitous suggestion.Resources,6/ the Comm-onweallh-Siv Walter Davidson, State Governor of New-South Wales, who has just, completed a trip through, vast fields of ripening wheat in the Riverina district of southern New South Wales, has been greatly impressed with the importance of this area as a producer of foodstuffs. The crops never looked better, and there is every evidence of a bountiful harvest. The Governor said that Australia was making sure progress by the extraction of the wealth of its soil, and-that in his opinion Australia was the best agricultural country in the world. On his return to England, he continued, he would do his utmost to make more widely known its wonderful resources. A. parliamentary party has just, completed a journey of-500 miles by special train and also a 500 mile motor trip through the rich lands in the south-west corner of Western Australia. The party viewed rivers flowing through valleys of surpassing beauty and wonderful fertility, surrounded by high hills on 34-4 D
which the soil was so rich that potatoes&apos;could &apos; be grown right up to their summits. They saw forests of giant karri and jarrah trees embracing untold timber wealth, and they passed through smiling orchards and rich pastures inhabited by a scanty, but healthy, happy, and confident people. These were the outstanding impressions of nine days&apos; journeying. -NEW ZEALAND.Meat. On 18th November the Governor-General sent the following reply to a telegram received from the Secretary, of State in regard to. Messrs. Armour. &amp; Co. : The Prime Minister has giveu very careful consideration to the whole question since his return to New Zealand, and endorses the attitude adopted by his ministerial colleagues during his absence, as explained in my telegram of 16th September and my despatch of 7th September, No. 187. Pie states it is regrettable that the company, after first proposing a method by which meat held hi store on their account could have been shipped to any destination, refused to give the required assurances regarding the conditions under which shipment could have been made,, such assurances being based on their own suggestion. My Government are still willing to give favourable consideration to the grant of permission for this meat to be shipped to any destination if the company give the undertaking suggested to them by my Government. The refusal to grant a licence to the company to export meat was decided on after most careful consideration of all the circumstances, special regard being given to the fact that the national welfare of New Zealand is almost entirely bound up in the welfare of the primary producers. The past record of Armour&apos;s and of certain other companies conducting similar business as shown by documents issued by the Imperial Government and by the Government of the United States, is considered by my Ministers fully sufficient grounds for the decision to refuse a licence to the company, and they are of opinion that the attitude adopted by the company towards the proposals regarding its stored meat confirms the soundness of that decision. Further consideration of the company&apos;s application for an export licence must be suspended pending the receipt by the New Zealand Parliament of certain petitions for and against the issue of the licences which are now being prepared. Full consideration will be given by my Ministers to the report of the parliamentary committee to which such petitions will be referred, The Prime Minister gives his assurance that the action of the Government of New Zealand in connexion with ArmouFs.has been taken entirely with regard to the merits of the individual case irrespective of nationality, and adds that it is a matter for extreme regret to the Dominion Government that it should have raised any question between the Imperial Government and the Government of the United States, with which country New Zealand is desirous of maintaining close and friendly relations, having special regard to various matters in which both have important interests in common.SOUTH AFRICA.Labour -for Ike Rand [B.E.R., Ivi, p. 71 On 12th November the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed as follows to the Governor-General in reply to the latteFs telegram of 3rd November : Please inform your Prime Minister that I regret that it seems impossible to proceed with the scheme in view of the considerations set forth in the telegram of 7th November from the Governor of Tanganyika Territory. 1 may add that the scheme for recruiting labour in Tanganyika for Kenya was sanctioned only on condition that the labourers were employed by the Government, and that owing to lack of recruits the scheme failed. ,The following is the telegram from the Governor of the Tanganyika Territory to which Mr. Churchill, refers : I regret that for the following reasons I cannot support the Prime MinisteFs proposal to recruit native labour in Tanganyika Territory : (1) The supply was formerly unequal to the local demands, and the Germans before the war were considering recruitment in Portuguese East Africa, The present surplus will shortly disappear as plantations are now being sold and re-established, and there is also a distinct promise of mining activity.   It may well be expected that
the German experience of the inadequacy of labour &quot;supply will be repeated in a -comparatively short*time.(2) Many of the tribes are physically unfit for heavy manual labour. I anticipate that- it would be difficult to find 5,000 volunteers since the failure of recruiting for Kenya and for the Beira-Nyasaland railway construction has revealed a strong disinclination of the natives to proceed outside of the territory for work, although anxious for employment at home.(3) The reasons which led to the discontinuance of the recruitment of natives of Nyasaland for the Witwatersrand mines, viz., lung affections and high mortality, will -apply with greater force to those of the Tanganyika Territory who are of distinctly inferior stamina compared with the Nyasaland men. It is my impression that, after experience in this connexion, the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association decided some years ago not to recruit natives from north of the 23rd parallel.The following paragraphs were telegraphed, by ReuteFs agents:  Inter-Imperial Trade. The Official Gazette announces the imposition of a duty against&quot; dumping&quot; which will come into force six weeks from the 18th instant on wheat imported from Australia! the duty to be equal to the difference, in the price of wheat for home consumption in Australia, and the price for export to. the Union of South Africa, provided that such duty shall not exceed .15 per cent, ad valorem. [Pretoria, 19th November.]Trade with. Germany. Colonel Mentz, the South African Minister of Defence, who arrived in Berlin a few daj^s ago for ,the purpose of finding ways and means of disposing of South African products, such as wool, maize, hides and skins, had a. number of conferences with the German Foreign Office and possible purchasers. Colonel Mentz is convinced that there is undoubtedly a great demand for these products, and is so satisfied with the progress made that he intends to stay another week in Berlin to promote as far as possible the conclusion of the business before he * leaves. Colonel Mentz is accompanied by Mr. Canham, the South African Trade Commissioner in London, and Mr. Boshof, a member of the High Commissioner^ staff.   [Berlin, 17th November.]A Trade Union loses Government Recognition. The Minister of Railways has withdrawn official recognition from the National Union of Railway and Harbour Services.   [Johannesburg, 15th November.]The Mining Industry, A. most important compromise has been effected with regard to the conditions of labour in the gold-mining industry, the men having agreed to various alterations which will ensure practically eight hours&apos; work daily by natives under white supervision.Further points in. the compromise are that the new regulations will allow greater freedom in the employment of experienced, natives, while much greater efficiency will be achieved among the rank and file natives.The most important, technical alteration, is the one which allows night shifts to prepare the working places. Hence the natives will start work promptly and will now do almost a full eight hours instead of five hours, actual working as at present. From the point of view of the men, the compromise is satisfactory since it enables the natives to be completely supervised, by white workers. [Johannesburg, 16th November.]Enemy Holdings in Companies. Colonel Sir Walter Hamilton Fowle, custodian of enemy property for the Union, is returning to South Africa to-morrow by the Arundei Castle. ReuteFs agency understands that a complete agreement has been -come to on all. points between the public trustee in England and. the Union custodian in connexion with the allocation of enemy shares in companies working in. South-Africa and all other outstanding matters.Further a scheme of procedure has been agreed upon with regard to the disposal of enemy shares in the mining companies.Under this arrangement all enemy shares in a company will be offered in one block and in the first instance to the groups and companies respectively concerned.Negotiations with regard to such sales in connexion with companies incorporated in England will be carried on by the public trustee, and with regard to shares in companies, incorporated in South Africa by the custodian for the Union.The public trusteed department is now preparing certain statistics which are -expected to be ready for despatch to South Africa by the end of next month, and as
soon as they arrive there negotiations for the disposal of the whole of; the enemy holdings&apos; will be commenced, aud it is hoped that &quot;these negotiations may b&amp; satisfactorily completed by the end of January.   [IGtli November.]General Herlzog on the Washington Conference. Speaking, at Smithlield (Orange Free State) to-day, General Hertzog declared with reference to the Washington conference, that &quot; the refusal of America to invite South Africa is of the greatest importance to the. South African people, indicating that we are not on. an equal footing of freedom with England and that the higher status of the Dominions from an international point of view is boldly denied.&quot;General Eertzog declared that as regards the question of subserviency to the Empire the Union of South Africa was in exactly the same position as one of the provinces of the Union towards the Union as a unit. Americans refusal was due to the knowledge that a subordinate position is no freedom and that so far as the Union was subordinate to the &quot;so-called Empire,&quot; it was not free, therefore it could not be counted.and placed in the rank of free States. In the course of further remarks General Hertzog said : &quot; We are a free people.&quot; In that, he said, he agreed with General Smuts, but added: &quot;Our freedom does not lie in our Dominion status but in our power to decide according to our own free sovereign will what will be the real scope of our national libertj^ at any time.&quot; He declared that by binding themselves to the Dominion status South Africans were simply renouncing their, constitutional powers of self-determination, and submitting the decision about Union status to the caprice of foreign arbitrament-Tested by the Washington conference, he said, Dominion status proved to be a. hollow sham.
