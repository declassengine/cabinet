GREAT BRITAIN.The Unemployment Situation. The following summary of the situation is taken from the special report on unemployment for the week ending 9th June :  . The continuance of the dispute in the engineering industry has exercised a marked effect on workers in that industry and those allied thereto. Firms who have received orders are unable to execute them owing to the dispute. Shipbuilding and coal-mining are particularly affected by this disturbing-factor. In the coal-mining industry, unemployment in the Bristol, Somerset and Forest of Dean coalfields is acute. In the Midlands division the tendency is towards serious depression, while in the north-western division the adoption of short-time working is becoming more general. In Scotland, the expected revival in this industry lias not materialized; but, while some slight improvement has been recorded in isolated areas in Wales, the general depression continues. The improvement in the iron and steel industry has been maintained in the Midlands, but in Scotland and Wales trade is quiet and prospects of recovery are not bright,- In the south-eastern division, the revival in the clothing industry has been maintained, but there is still a shortage of machinists and dressmakers. In the south-western division the improvements previously recorded in the lace and glove trades continue. In the Midlands division a slight improvement in the plain net section of the lace industry has occurred. The improvement recorded in the cotton industry has been maintained. Favourable reports on the position in the hosiery and woollen industries have been received, from the Midlands and Scotland divisions. Although serious unemployment in the boot and shoe trade continues at Bristol, some signs of improvement have been reported from Kingswood. In most divisions the building trade is quiet, although a fair amount of seasonal decorative and repair work continues. Unemployment in the paper and printing industries in the south-western division continues to be acute. In the south-eastern division a revival in cabinet-making has been observed. Some activity is reported at the larger docks in the south-western division. In Scotland, although home fishing has commenced, operations are still below normal. The revival recently recorded in the jute industry is apparently due to speculative business and may not, therefore, be permanent.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.IRAQ.Miscellaneous. The following items are taken from the eighth intelligence report dated 15th April: I. On 8th April the Council agreed to a rise of 5 per cent, on certain imports and of 2 per cent, on exported case dates.2. The summons issued by Shaikh Mahdi al Khalisi to the leaders of the people to attend at Karbala, in order to consider means of ,protecting the country from the akhwan has produced a far-roach in a; impression, of which the consequences are still uncertain.?). The influx of darwishes to Kirkuk continues to offer disquieting features. Turkish propaganda is still active in the Liwah.4. A small akhwan raid occurred south of Samawah oil 1st April, but Faisal Da wish is reported, to have returned to Artawiyuh.5. The High Commissioner has laid down in a message to Ibn Said a pro-visional frontier line between Iraq and Najd. Ibn Sands representative has left for Muhanmiarah to take part in negotiations for a treaty between the two Arab States.The ninth report, dated 1st May, includes the following items :  1. At a meeting on 18th April an attempt to induce the Council to pass a reso-lutioh regarding the necessity of taking costly measures for the defence of the country against the akhwan failed, chiefly owing to the opposition of Susan Effeudi and. the Naqib.2. At a meeting on 22nd April the Council discussed a letter from.the High Commissioner regarding the defence of the southern frontier, in which it was suggested that an arrangement should be made with the British general headquarters, and. that, in view of Ibn SaucFs evident regret at recent occurrences, any action of a provocative nature was highly undesirable. The Council was very favourably impressed by the letter, and referred the question to the Ministries of Interior and
Defence, as a result of which -it has been decided to send two squadrons of cavalry and three-companies ol-infantry to Nasiriyah.3. Action is (being taken to prevent the influx of darwishes into Kirkuk.4. A letter has been -received irom dbn -Sand after meeting with -Faisal al Dawish. Ibn:Saud-says he does not accept the letters excuses, aud renews his apologies for the -raicbon the camel corps.INDIA.The Fortnigliily Report.-Thetdllowing official information from India is dated 14th June :-Madras.-There has been no marked increase in political activity. Fairly vigorous propaganda continues, particularly amongst the mohamedan community-in parts of the presidency, in support of the sale of khaddar (native cloth). The results are not encouraging. In Malabar it is probable that the few rebel bands will soon break up ; action is confined to hunting down individuals in hiding.Bengal.-There is almost a complete absence of activity on the part of non-co-operators. The situation has Improved generally so far as overt acts are concerned. Unrest, however, has not yet subsided. For example, in Chittagong some constables were attacked by a crowd of Kahars and forced to fire in self-defence ; this incident, however, arose out of a land dispute. Additional police are quartered in Cox Bazar sub-division in Chittagong. The insubordination of prisoners in various jails gives some trouble. Congress and caliphate executives are hampered by want of funds, and little progress has been made by them in their constructive programme. There are indications of a struggle for supremacy between extremists and moderates, in which at present the latter have the upper hand.Bombay. The political situation is unchanged. Gujarat political conference attracted a small attendance and little attention.United Provinces.-There&apos;has been little outward change. Pressure is being-brought to bear on the foreign cloth dealers of Cawnpore to cease their sales, largely through a social boycott. The Government is considering measures of protection. Pandit Motilal Nehru (of Allahabad) was released on 6th June, and on the 9th presided over a meeting at Lucknow under the auspices of the caliphate committee. The meeting demanded, the publication of the international commission^ report on Greek atrocities in Smyrna, and declared that India would not be satisfied with an enquiry which did not include representatives of independent rnoslem states and the central caliphate committee. Lucknow reports rumours that underground work of agitators has increased, and Rohilkhand shows signs of new activity. Elsewhere the signs of revival, of subversive work are few or none. The All-India congress committee meeting at Lucknow has placed on record gandhis services to the cause of [humanity, and reiterated its faith in non-violent non-co-operation which was inaugurated bv him. The working committee&apos;s recommendation for a reduction of provincial contributions to the All-India congress committee from 25 to 5 per cent, was approved. A committee was appointed to formulate a scheme for bettering the condition of the so-called untouchables, and to raise five lakhs (Pis. 5,00,000) for the purpose. The All-India committee considered a resolution of the working committee&apos;s regarding postponement, till the end of September, of the question of retaliatory measures to meet the Governments continuous repressive policy, and ultimately decided, while taking note of the widespread feeling for the adoption of civil disobedience to compel the Government to abandon the policy of repression, that the carrying out of a constructive programme was the best preparation for mass civil disobedience and the most effective means of furthering the objects of the congress. An earnest appeal is made to the country to carry out the constructive programme to the fullest extent -in. the shortest possible period. The question of the. adoption of civil disobedience is to be considered on 15th August, and. in the meantime, the president would nominate a few members to tour the country and&apos;-report on the situation. A Lucknow district political conference passed a resolution urging the people of the district to carry out a constructive programme in order to prepare the district for civil disobedience.Punjab.-There has been no recrudescence of political excitement. In some districts -Pundit -Malaviya has succeeded in stimulating the local congress party to greater political activity, but. has failed to win the support of the mohamedans. In a few districts only is a recrudescence of the akali agitation anticipated after the harvest. Akali and other sikhs have lately been concerned in a certain amount of violent crime. In some districts the akalis are reported to be friendly. Some 41-4 A 2
evidence is also available indicating a desire on the part of the malcontents to get at sikh troops under the guise of religious teaching. Generally, the attitude is one of expectancy, and district officers express fear that the situation is likely to deteriorate if the firmness of the Government is relaxed so as to give the impression of weakness. The prospect at present appears calm; officers have been warned to deal promptly with any attempts on the part of the akalis to revive their previous turbulent attitude. The Commissioner at Amballa says that the non-co-operation movement has collapsed. A certain amount of opposition has been engineered against the proposed Gurdwara Bill (which deals with the administration of sikh shrines), which Bill is now under consideration by the Government of India.Central Provinces. The situation is quiet. In the south of the province in several perganas (districts) there is a movement for the boycott of cloth ; picketing of liquor shops is on the decline. There are signs that some local bodies are beginning to take action to challenge the authority of the Minister, and to introduce in local self-government administration measures in support of the non-co-operation programme.- Assam. Conditions in the greater part of the Assam Valley are satisfactory, but there are indications of an increasing tendency for the non-co-operation move-ment to assume a religious cloak. There is little to report from the Surma Valley ; interest seems centred in the assessment of the cost of the additional police.North-West Frontier Province. Interest centres on the tour of. the North-West Frontier Province Committee. Agitation for the amalgamation with the Punjab has shown itself as clearly organized by the. hindu residents of big towns, led by members of the bar. Discussion revealed it as mainly a hindu versus mohamedan question.Delhi. No political activity is shown. The expiry of the Seditious Meetings Act passed unnoticed.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.The Barcelona Declaration. On 20th June the Governor-General reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that a minute of Council had been approved that day, intimating that Canada accepted the principle of the declaration recognizing the right to a flag of States having no sea coast, and desired that her adhesion should be given to it after ratification.AUSTRALIA.Ratification of Treaties [B.E.R., Ixix, p. 6]. On 12th June the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in reply to the latteFs message of the 10th May, saying that his Government proposed to concur in the ratification of the treaties signed at Washington, and would take the necessary enabling action when the occasion arose.SOUTH AFRICA.Mozambique Convention [B.E.R., Ixvii, p. 8], On 16th June the Governor-General transmitted to the Secretary of State for the Colonies the following message from General Smuts, who asked that it might be communicated to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty s representative at Lisbon : The negotiations for a new Mozambique convention between the Union Govern-ment and the Portuguese delegation under Senhor d&apos;Andrade have so far proved abortive. The Union Government propose an autonomous joint commission, on which the Union Government would have a majority of members, to manage the railways and the port of Delagoa Bay, together with a section of the Union railways. An alternative proposal by the Portuguese delegation involved Portuguese control, to which, in view of the past administration at Delagoa Bay, the Union Government would not agree. The High Commissioner at Mozambique was sent for and has taken part in the negotiations of the past week. It is clear that his views are more adverse to the Union claims than those of Senhor cTAndrade, and it now appears as if agreement will be impossible. The Union Government have informed the Portuguese delegation that, unless an agreement is concluded, before the end of March next, they will reserve a completely free hand as to their future course of action, and will proceed to develop a new port south of Delagoa Bay, and will meanwhile deflect traffic to Durban.&apos; Importance is attached by the Mozambique
administration to the native labour supplied to the Transvaal mines, but the Union Government do not fear that this supply will be or could be seriously cut off or reduced, ft is to be feared that the financial and economic results for Mozambique, and Lourenco Marques in particular, will be disastrous.Meat Industry. In the Union House of Assembly to-day a motion for the -appointment of a select committee to enquire into the allegations of Mr. Alexander, an Independent member, was adopted by the House. On 19th May Mr. Alexander read what he described as an agreement between the Meat Producers Exchange, a more or less co-operative concern founded in Johannesburg by Rhodesian ranchers, and the Imperial Cold Storage Company, which, he said, showed that the combine had sought to obtain a virtual monopoly. He alleged that the Government had favoured the co-operation of the two companies and had promised railway facilities for the purpose of ensuring better prices to farmers for slaughter stock and the exportation of surplus meat. He. argued that this portended a great monopoly, against which farmers and consumers alike were powerless. The Government officially denied knowledge of this agreement. General Smuts agreed to the appointment of the committee. Pie assured the House that the Government did not seek to favour a monopoly and proceeded to amplify his reference to the meat industry on 22nd May, when he said that one of the gravest questions exercising the Government was the meat industry, &quot; which was in a state of chaos.&quot;He pointed out the difficulties attending this question, and said that, firstly, the Union was at present producing an annual surplus of a hundred thousand head of cattle which, if not exported, depressed the local market; and, secondly, that export was at present almost at a standstill.He added that, seeing that it was almost impossible to enter the British market, which demanded the best qualities, he was hopeful, subject to the expenditure of time, trouble and money, of building up a trade on the European continent. [Capetown, 6th June.]Immigration. General Hertzog, the Nationalist leader, moving the reduction of the PremiePs salary in the Union House of Assembly to-day, accused General Smuts of doing nothing to relieve unemployment, more particularly by the development of industries. On the contrary, he asserted, the Government was aggravating the evil by encouraging immigration. &apos;General Smuts, in reply, contended that the Government relief works were coping with unemployment effectively. The industrial developments which he had foreshadowed in his speech on 28th May during the Budget debate, required time. The present difficulty was the financial stringency, and for this reason all the Government was doing at present to encourage immigration was advertising in Europe. This was regrettable, because he was of the opinion that one of the factors in keeping down the white man in South Africa was the smallness of the white popula-tiou and the fact that the black was gradually replacing hint at a cheaper wage. General. Sinuts pointed out that the High Commissioners office in London was dissuading would-be immigrants with a capital of only a few hundred pounds, who could not be absorbed, but was sending out a richer type in fair numbers. Everyone bringing to South Africa technical skill, education and capital should be welcomed with open arms.   [Capetown, Pith June.]Proposed Old Age Pensions. In the Union House of Assembly to-day General Smuts accepted the proposal to appoint a government commission to consider the advisability of instituting old age pensions in view of the legislation for 1923.The Premier pointed out that financial stringency might make the scheme impossible for the present.   [Capetown, 6th June.]New Estate and Succession Duties. In the Union House of Assembly to-day a member ol the Government stated that the new estate and succession duties, from which Mr. Burton, the Finance Minister, announced on 5th May last that he expected a yield of 195,0001, would apply to shares of companies registered in South Africa, municipal stock, &amp;c, irrespective of the testatoFs domicile.   [Capetown, 9th June.]NEWFOUNDLAND.The Barcelona Declaration [B.E.R., lxx, p. 6], On 19th June the Governor informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that his Ministers concurred in the ratification of the Barcelona declaration-
