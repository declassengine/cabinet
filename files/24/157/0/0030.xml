GREAT BRITAIN.The Unemployment Situation. The following summary of the situation is taken from the special report on unemployment for the week ending 12th May issued by the Ministry of Labour : -The lock-out in the shipbuilding industry has terminated, and the workers suspended are gradually being re-engaged, but the return to work is affected by the continuance of the engineering dispute.Coal-mining in Lancashire has received a further set-back, but the improvement previously recorded in the pits in Yorkshire and Durham continues.The iron and steel industries are very quiet, but there is evidence of an increase in the export trade. The depression in the Midlands continues, although at one centre a slight improvement in iron-founding has been reported.Although the dispute in the engineering trade generally continues, isolated agreements have been reached in certain towns, but in the south-eastern, south-western, north-western and Scottish divisions this trade is practically at a standstill.There.is evidence of an increased activity in the cotton &apos;trade. Short-time working is still widely in operation, but hopes are entertained that a longer working week will shortly be adopted.Constant and regular employment is reported from Scotland in the hosiery, woollen aud textile industries, but the improvement recorded in the north-eastern division has not been maintained,The clothing trade is reported to be fairly brisk, but is still subject to seasonal fluctuation. In the south-east of England there is a demand for cutters and machinists.The building trade generally is quiet, but seasonal decorative and repair work is proceeding.In the boot and shoe industry the improvement in trade at Northampton has been maintained ; but, while the position at Stafford is favourable, depression still exists at Kettering aud Leicester. In Scotland there is considerable unemployment in the fishing industry on account of the heavy costs of running vessels.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.RH.0 DESIA.The Union of South Africa and Rhodesia. See under &quot; Dominions, South Africa.&quot;INDIA.The Viceroys Fortnightly Report. The following telegram was sent on 13th May:-Section 1. Bombay. The second Maharashtra provincial conference on the 16th and 17th passed a resolution to carry on the present non-co-operation programme, with the amendment that the provincial congress committee should appoint a sub-committee to consider revisions. The conference evoked little enthusiasm. Mischievous rumours regarding the flogging of Gandhi in jail have been circulated, with a view to stimulate non-co-operation, but promptly denied. The reports show that the masses displayed very little interest in the national week. There has been a recrudescence of the agitation over the building of the clam by the Tata Company at Mulshi and Patha. Several of the ringleaders have been convicted for disobedience of the prohibiting notices issued by the district magistrate. It is reported that the so-called Satyagrahis intend to start passive resistance against the notices from 1st May.Bengal. Non-co-operators are at present mainly interested in discussion, and the ull in activity continues.   The congress committee refused to permit departure from
the Delhi and Bardoli programmes until theKhaddar programme has been given fair trial. Patel declared that the country would soon take up not merely individual civil disobedience, but mass civil disobedience, but the speeches were generally moderate iu tone. The collection of the Ohaukidari tax has been practically normal everywhere, but combined opposition in Eangpur to payment led to an attack on the police, while seeking to arrest offenders, and culminated in firing with a fatal result. The situation has undergone little change.Section 2. The non-co-operation party appears to be falling into two groups, one to oust the moderates and force the pace of reforms, the other, including a portion of the caliphate party, to violent methods and underground working. Information regarding the revival of old Bengal secret societies continues to accumulate also some evidence is now to hand indicating a connexion between the Indian labour movement and Bolshevism, through the medium of Russian Bolshevik agents, who have attempted without success to gain a footing in India.United Provinces.-The lull continues. National week provoked little enthusiasm and no disturbance. The hartal of 13th and 14th was incomplete, and, similarly, the Eka movement is giving no trouble, but the (Governor in Council is examining the agrarian problems which lie at its roots. In particular, cesses (?) imposed rent and grain rents will form the subject of special enquiry with a view to early action. The political conference at Dehra Dun at Easter was prohibited. In the west end of the province the extremists are losing ground and there is little or no sign of recrudescence. In Allahabad, however, quiet propaganda work is reported to be widespread.Punjab.- The improvement in the political situation has been maintained. The non-co-operation movement has lost, for the time being, popularity, and the worst firebrands are in jail; the other supporters are unwilling to court imprisonment.Section 3. A few instances of picketing have been organized by the local congress and caliphate committees. Hartal was observed in a number of towns on the 18th; foreign cloths were collected for destruction. The demonstration failed to arouse much enthusiasm.Section 4. Malaviya is still in the Punjab and endeavouring to revive agitation. Tbe committees formed by him, and reported in our last fortnightly telegram, have not hitherto taken any overt action. The extremist agitators are reported to be disappointed at the mildness of the Pandit speeches.Section 5. A manifesto, protesting against the so-called repressive policy of the Government, has been published over the signature of 51 members of the High Court. The Punjab Government have issued a full communique on their policy. The akali cases are being disposed of as rapidly as possible. A few fresh ones have been instituted at Lyallpur. Demonstrations at the trials of political prisoners had to be dispersed by force, but elsewhere the cases are proceeding quietly.Section 6. The provincial congress resolution supporting the cause of the akalis has caused a setback, and by stiffening the backs of the akali leaders have undone a certain amount of good done by the recent arrests.Section 7. The cases will be scrutinized before they are brought to court, and examined by a High Court judge after conviction. The parbanclbak committee is still unfriendly to the proposed gurdwara bill, but the bill has been approved, with certain modifications, by the sikh members of Council. A break in the prices of food grains is becoming apparent, and should greatly ease the situation.Section 8. The effect of Malaviya&apos;s attempts to revive agitation has jret to be seen. On the whole it is probable that the check administered to (? turbulent) (? decay of) the akali movement, together with a good spring harvest and fall in prices, will produce an improved situation.Section 9. Bihar and Orissa. No clue has been obtained about the derailment of the Punjab mail, or the attempt to blow up a bridge in the Orissa division. There has been some local panic regarding incendiarism in Puri and Balasore. In the latter place non-co-operators joined the police in trying to allay the panic.Chota-Nagpur. In general the political situation is quiet.Section 10.   There has been some abortive unrest in Rauchi, but the movement is believed to be not anti-European but anti-landlord.   The Commissioner of Tirhoot 40-4 A 2
reports that the general situation continues to be peaceful; some difficulty has been experienced in the district of Sarah in collecting the Chaukidari tax.Section 11. A non-co-operator has been elected chairman of the district hoard at Bhagalpur in the Patna division. The trouble between the Rajah of Amawan and his tenants continues, and is being exploited by the leaders of the non-co-operation movement, who.have held enquiry into the alleged grievances.Section 12. General. The non-co-operation movement is suffering a setback, and the efforts to revive it have hitherto met with little success. Meetings are poorly attended, and subscriptions are falling off. The week of national mourning was a failure, and the hartal of 13th-14th only partially observed. A certain amount of fitful picketing of liquor shops is reported from certain districts, but there has been little success.   Orders are being freely placed for foreign cloth.Assam. There has been no change in the political situation. Detailed reports confirm the general failure of the attempted hartal. An undercurrent of unpleasant feeling has been reported from two districts of the Assam Valley, but the general position in that division is almost normal. The Surma Valley remains perfectly quiet, apparently due, to some extent, to the employment of the Assam Rifles and additional police. People are busy with the crops, and the majority are returning to political sanity, but, at the same time, attention is fixed on Bengal and the rest of India.Section 13. Central Provinces. Chief events : The hindi provincial conference at Ohhindwara, and the provincial caliphate conference, the CP. students&apos; conference, and the municipal conference. The conferences were fairly well attended and attracted larger audiences than anticipated. As a result of the resignation of members of the congress committee, reported last fortnight, the management passed into the hands of the more extreme followers of the Gandhi programme. The present office bearers have not the same local influence as former leaders. At a special session, held at Nagpur on the 7th, the congress committee decided substantially to adopt the recom-meiidation of the sub-committee, which recommended a change in the present congress programme, so that non-co-operators may, in future, stand for elections and capture public bodies and councils. The changes proposed will, in due course, come before the All-India congress committee for decision.Section 14. Complete reports regarding the national week and the hartal of the 13th confirm the impression that the former -was a fiasco,&apos;while the latter was partially successful. Renewed (? omission) being made to secure the boycott of foreign cloth, but some dealers are becoming restive. The national schools has failed or is moribund. -.Section 15. North-West Frontier Province. The political situation is quiet generaUy. Following on the violence shown by the volunteers and the caliphate committee officers during His Royal Highness&apos;s visit, 18 volunteers have been convicted of an offence under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, and the vice-president and -the secretary of the caliphate committee ordered to furnish security under section 40 of the Frontier Crimes Regulations. The latter went to jail in default. There was partial hartal in Peshawar on the 18th April, but nothing of. the sort iu other districts.Headquarters, Burma, The Burmese extremist propaganda continues. At a private meeting, the Burma provincial congress committee decided to open Ivhaddar stores and a spinning and weaving school in Rangoon, but it is doubtful whether much will come of either project.Section 1.6., Delhi, There has been a complete absence of political excitement. Recruiting for the congress aud caliphate members has been unorganized and unsuccessful. The caliphate committee is in trouble over accounts. The increase in ordinary crime shows no signs of abating. The improvement in the piece-goods market has been maintained, but old stocks are not being cleared as fast as dealers would like..General. The situation generally continues as reported in our last telegram. The non-co-operators are still rent by internal dissensions and are without any clearly defined objective. There is evidently a considerable body -which desires to enter the councils and the decision of the CP. Committee may be followed by further defections.
THE DOMINIONS.The Barcelona Declaration. On 19tli May the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governors-General of Canada, Australia, and South Africa as follows :- The Government of Switzerland have raised the question whether the declaration regarding flag nations having no sea-coast signed at Barcelona on 20th April 1921 requires ratification. The declaration which appears on pages 25 and 26 of the. League of Nations paper, C. 479, M. 327, was signed by Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith,-subject to a declaration as to the Dominions not represented at the conference to the effect that his signature did not bind such. Dominions, and that their right to sign or. adhere later was reserved. It is understood that the Secretary-General of the League -considers ratification necessary, and in the circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government think it desirable that the declaration should be ratified by His Majesty. It is hoped that your Ministers will accept the principle of the declaration. If so, would they prefer arrangements to be made for signature on their behalf before ratification or that notification of adherence should be given later ?:      CANADA.. Signature of League of Nations Protocols. On 15th May the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Government of Canada were authorizing the High Commissioner in London to proceed to Geneva immediately to sign the protocols of the amendments to the covenant of the League of Nations except those relative to Article 16. They proposed, however, to submit the amendments to Parliament, which was sitting, before advising ratification.AUSTRALIA.Meat [B.E.R., Ixviii, p. 5]. On 17th May the Secretary of State for the Colonies, sent the following telegram to the Governor-General for transmission to his Prime Minister : The Board of Trade have examined the matter carefully but do not see that advantage would accrue to Australian meat producers from the simple adoption of a licensing scheme such as is adumbrated in paras. 63 and 64 of the Bridgeman report. If the object is to use powers of enquiry for the purpose of exploring the operations of the &quot; Meat Trust,&quot; it is explained that the recommendations in question were made at a time when a definite policy of setting up machinery for the control of the trusts was under consideration, and that it was abandoned in deference to popular aversion from the continuance of any kind of state control over trade and industry. The Board regard it as impracticable to reverse this decision and to introduce legislation now for the control of one industry; being convinced that the possible exclusion of a person from his trade by the cancellation of his license would be regarded as a dangerous extension of bureaucratic control and likely to be opposed strongly by the business world and Parliament. There has been experience of licensing all sections of the meat trade while the Ministry of Food was in existence and ali meat was the property of the&quot; Government; and licensing, though only one instrument of control, is asso-ciated in the public mind with a very complete control of the industry. Now. that this policy has been abandoned and the staff disbanded in obedience to a general -demand for freedom from state control, it is felt that it would be peculiarly difficult to reimpose the licensing system even though its objects were entirely different from those with which it was formerly connected. The attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment towards operations of the American companies in this country continues, however, to be one of constant watchfulness, and the Board are always ready to receive information on the subject from interested parties.NEW ZEALAND.Ratification of Treaties. On 18th May the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in reply to the latteFs telegram of 18th May, informing him that the Government of New Zealand concurred in the ratification of all treaties signed at Washington when the time comes for this to be done.
GThe Barcelona Declaration. The Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed&quot; to the Governor-General as follows on 13thMay :  The Government of Switzerland have raised the question whether the declaration-regarding the flag of nations having no sea coast, signed at Barcelona on 20th April. 1921, requires ratification. The declaration which appears on pages 25 and 26,. League of Nations paper 0. 4-79 M. 327, was signed by Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith, on behalf of New Zealand. It is understood that the Secretary-General of the League considers ratification necessary, and, in the circumstances, His Majesty s Government think it desirable that the declaration should be ratified by His Majesty at the same time as the transit conventions. Do your Ministers concur in ratification on behalf of New Zealand ?To this the Governor-General replied on 23rd May, saying that his Government concurred in the ratification by His Majesty.SOUTH AFRICA. - The following paragraphs were telegraphed by ReuteFs agents :  (1) The Union and Rhodesia [B.E.B. XVIII, p. 6]. No official statement is being-issued at present regarding the conference between the Union Government and the-Rhodesiau Government on the subject of the contemplated entry of Rhodesia into-the Union, although the conference terminates to-morrow. ft is understood, however, that a good deal of ground has been cleared during the negotiations, which have been amicable throughout, the terms asked and offered on either side having apparently been of a reasonable nature. It is understood that one of the points-still outstanding is Rhodesia&apos;s representation on the Union parliament. The precise-terms remain to be framed.   [Capetown, 17th April.](2) Secession from tlie Industrial Federation. The Engine Drivers&apos; and Fire-men&apos;s Union has decided to secede from the South African Industrial Federation. The decision of the union, which is one of the most important of those affiliated to the federation, is believed to be the result of an opinion that the federation was not. justified in its leadership during the recent strike and that the union&apos;s interests would be best served by an independent status.   [Johannesburg, 6th May.](3) Rand Revolution Indemnity Bill. In the Senate to-day the Indemnity Bill arising from the Rand revolution was read for the. second time by 21. votes to 13. [Capetown, 9th May.](4) Electricity Bill. Mr. Malan, Minister of Mines and Industry, introduced in the-Union House of Assembly to-day a bill relinquishing tho Governments half share of the-licence moneys derived from mining claims. Not only will this benefit the larger mines, but it will also encourage the prospecting and development of outside districts. The remaining half of the moneys is due to the freehold proprietor, and is regarded as a vested right.Mr. Malan also introduced an electricity bill, the object of which is to ensure that the consumer of power gets the power as cheaply and efficiently as possible. The bill provides for the creation of a commission empowered to raise capital and erect power stations at suitable centres. One advantage of the measure will be the utilization of coal hitherto wasted, thus leaving the superior coal available for export purposes. [Capetown, 11th May.]NEWFOUNDLAND.The Barcelona Declaration. The following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor on 13th May : The Government of Switzerland have raised the question whether the declaration, regarding the flag of nations having no sea coast, signed at Barcelona on 20th April 1921, requires ratification. The declaration, which appears on pages 25 and 26 of League of Nations paper C. 479 M. 327, was signed by Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith, subject to the same declaration as in the case of the transit conventions as regards Dominions not represented at the conference. It is understood that the Secretary-General of the League considers ratification necessary, and, in the circurn-stances, His Majesty&apos;s Government think it desirable that declaration should be ratified, by His Majesty at the same time as the transit conventions. Do your Ministers concur in ratification on behalf of Newfoundland?
