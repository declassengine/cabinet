Telegraphing from Nairobi on 10th October ReuteFs agent reported that Sir Edward Northey, the Governor, had that day opened the Legislative Council. In the course of his speech he appealed for a truce as regarded the Indian question. He said that he could make no announcement on this matter, but that it would be seriously and quietly considered.On 15th October he further reported as follows :--It is understood here that the following are the proposed terms of the settlement of the Indian question: (1) A basis of equal rights for all civilized persons..(2.) A conunou electoral roll on a property and education basis, but as a temporary measure four Indian members in the Legislative Council. (3) One Indian member on the Executive Council.(4) No segregation of the commercial area and no segregation of the residential Indian voters, but the lower classes will be segregated.(5) Immigration regulations to be the same as for Europeans plus tho English r-..;. &apos;     test as for voters on the roll.(6). The highlands to be reserved for Europeans, but the area between Voi and the Vatta plains to be set aside for Indians and restrictions imposed against Europeans.It is believed that the Europeans are willing to accept these terms, which, it is understood, will be submitted to a joint conference. If this joint conference is unable to agree a royal commission will be appointed.Telegraphing again on 18th October, he said : The Governor stated at a meeting of the Legislative Council of Kenya Colony to-day that there would be no radical change in the existing situation as regards the Indians until i4th March 1923, wdien the Council would normaUy dissolve. He was prepared to nominate one Indian to the Executive and four to the Legislative Council as an interim measure, pending the settlement of the whole question of policy. It is understood that the Indians will not avail themselves of the offer until the main question is-settled.EGYPT.Zagldoul Pasha. The following telegram [No. 587] was sent by Mr. Scott on 20th October :-Zaghloul Pasha&apos;s &quot;tour in Upper Egypt is giving rise to affrays between, his adherents and those of the Government which have broken out on the approach of his steamer at two out of the three principal places which be has hitherto attempted to visit, namely, Assiut and Girgeh. At the request of the local authorities Zaghloul Pasha refrained from landing, but in one instance at least his gestures and words from the steamer increased the turmoil on the bank, and. the preparations for the remainder of his tour are being continued. At the third place, Sohag, his local reception committee asked him not to come, fearing trouble.
The Egyptian Government have received a large number of protests from, members of the provincial councils, notables and other inhabitants of the provinces which Zaghloul Pasha is due to visit, and the liberal attitude, the Government have hitherto observed is generally regarded as a sign of weakness.The acting Prime Minister explains that he has reluctantly advocated stronger ineasures, but &quot;that the events alluded to above have convinced him that they are necessary if more bloodshed is to be avoided. Pre says he cannot remain deaf to the. appeals from the provinces, and he asks that further visits should bo prohibited under martial law.After very careful consideration and consultation with the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior I have agreed.The French Minister writes to me that the French citizens in the Fayoum are seriously alarmed that occurrences similar to those at Assiut may take place in the Fayoum. The Bedouin living on the borders of the Fayoum and Minia have stated their determination to oppose the visits of Zaghloul Pasha at all hazards.His visits have already created regrettable feuds amongst the villagers .in Upper Egypt, and if they are continued their least effect will be to increase the general feeling of excitement at a time when a period of tranquillity is especially desirable in preparation, for whatever conclusion may be reached by the London negotiations.Telegraphing [No. 595] again 011 24th October, Mr. Scott reported that Zaghloul. Pasha was said to be somewhat disheartened, and that it was hoped that before long he would voluntarily return to Cairo.Relations with the Government. On 24th October Mr. Scott reported [No. 595] that our relations with the Government were harmonious, and that so long as we continued the policy of according them all reasonable support in the maintenance of their authority and pursue wholeheartedly the aim of reaching a settlement, or alternatively a modus vivendi with Adly Pasha, the efforts of Zaghloul Pasha to disturb those relations, if that were his aim, could not succeed.MESOPOTAMIA.Iraq.The External Situation. The High Commissioner for Iraq telegraphed [No. 57.1] as follows to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 11th October : Reviewing the position from this end, the salient points of the situation to-day seem to be:-(1) Irritated no doubt by a misconception of our policy in. Syria and Iraq, the French have endeavoured to conclude an agreement with Mustapha Kemal, so far without complete success. It is their hope to aggrandize their own influence and interests in the Near East at the expense of those of the British. (2) It is still Mustapha&apos;s belief that Great Britain is the mainstay of the Greeks and, in consequence, he is extremely resentful. (3) Disappointed at the recent success of Mustapha and Enver Pasha&apos;s consequent loss of prestige, Bolshevik Russia is fearful lest the Franco-Turkish solidarity should defeat her ends in Turkey, She is therefore scheming (a) to widen the differences between England and France; (6) to (? group omitted) Franco-Turkish negotiations, thereby Increasing her prestige at Mustapha&apos;s expense.The outcome of the developments at Angora during the next few days will have such vital consequences for Iraq that I venture to urge upon His Majesty&apos;s Government my most strong conviction not only that now is the psychological moment for immediate action, but that any delay may prove most prejudicial to our interests.In order to counteract the factors and forces working against us, our desiderata clearly are (1) a policy of co-operation with the French, and (2) the opening of a door for negotiations with the Angora Government. May 1 be permitted to suggest as regards France that the secret information in the possession of His Majesty&apos;s Government may perhaps be capable of exploration and France induced to continue her negotiations at Angora, but on a basis that will be acceptable both to His Majesty&apos;s Government -and to Mustapha? Perhaps it could be suggested to the French that the main reason Tor the Angora Governments disinclination to accept the French proposals is that they are alarmed at the exclusive privileges which the French Government are endeavouring to secure; and this being so, it would be in their own interest, as well as that of Europe in general, to modify their ambitions. The ideal result would, be that ultimately the negotiations should become tripartite. I have already intimated that as regards the latter the best method that I can suggest is that King Feisal should open negotiations; and it is for consideration -whether, in view of the extreme urgency of
-the situation, communication might not be attempted by wireless. I realize that any such communication would have to be so worded that the French might know of it,&apos;, and had the position at Angora seemed less critical I would not have suggested it.. The Bolshevik menace would probably cease to cause anxiety and Iraq could hope for that peace on her borders which is essential to her salvation were these two policies, viz., reconciliation with France and the (? acceleration of) negotiations with Mustapha to succeed.New Moslem Move. On 15th October the High Commissioner transmitted [No. 585] the following &apos;? telegram for the information of the Secretary of State :  Vice-Consul Warren at Xermanshah was informed a few days ago by Sharif Dowleh, late Governor-General of Persian Kurdistan, that the Turnish nationalists are endeavouring to raise an army in. North Kurdistan, Caucasus, or Persian Kurdistan,&apos; with the object of overthrowing all European influence in the East. The army is to be called the- army of Islam, and support from the Mohamedans of India and Mesopotamia is reckoned on by the party.France and King. Feisal. Telegraphing [No. 775] from Paris on 2.1st October Lord Harclinge reported that the day before a violent attack had been made in the Chamber on the French policy in Syria by the Communist deputy Berthon, who had also criticized the French Government for their attitude towards King Feisal, and that M. Briand had dealt at some length with the latter question.The French Government, M. Briand said, had not failed to draw the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the clanger of installing King Feisal so near to Syria ;, His Majesty&apos;s Government had waited some time before taking a decision, but had. finally considered themselves bound to him after the consultation of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia-a &quot;consultation of the conditions of which he, M. Briand, knew nothing.. France could not claim the right of imposing her views on her.allies, and she had in any case received the most formal assurances from His Majesty&apos;s- Government that King Feisaf and his brother, who was installed in Transjordania, would cause no anxiety to the French. It was now the duty of these rulers to maintain good relations with the French and give proofs of their loyalty. Failure to do so would not be without danger for them.INDIA.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R.. liv, p. 4]. Referring to the Viceroy&apos;s telegram [2313 S] of 3rd October and preceding telegrams, the Secretary of State telegraphed [1539] on 7th October his reluctant agreement that the exclusive treaty had to be set aside for the present.   At the same time the Viceroy&apos;s proposal to proceed with the pis aller did not commend itself to him.    The main obstacle, among others wdiich might be overcome, was the disclosure, of the Bolshevik treaty in full, and the Secretary of State could see no justification for our giving way on that point.   He suggested that Sir Henry Dobbs might put the case before the Amir on the lines that,, as we could not honourably conclude an exclusive treaty now, and that the Amir-would not accept a neighbourly treaty, they should agree to,await a better opportunity. If, as it appeared, the Amir now realized the true character and attitude of the-Bolsheviks, and should he be anxious to be clear of the Russian treaty, let him denounce it, and then come to us, freed from his engagements, for a bond fide exclusive treaty, which we should make every endeavour to conclude.Should the Amir object that this would invite a Russian attack, Sir Henry Dobbs would be able to assure him that, assuming there had been no other provocative-action on the Amir&apos;s part, he could remain confident of receiving the assistance of the British Government.The Viceroy replied [235G S.] on 10th October that he had reviewed the whole-question in the light of the foregoing telegram, and had come to the conclusion that two main alternatives were before them : -(1) An adjournment of negotiations, with the interchange&apos; of Ministers; (2) reversion to the old treaty of friendship, with the payment of a subsidy. The only attraction of the former was that of avoiding a formal rupture and of gaining time for favourable developments. Previous experience, however, as at Pindi, had not justified delay, and had only encouraged
the Amir to prove the necessity of Afghan friendship by the costliness of indefinite relations. Moreover, as communicated by letter from Sir Heury Dobbs, the Amir, in the course of conversation; had said that if weworrld not accept his terms he would be against us, whatever the consequences. He would not have a treaty with no profit to Afghanistan.The Viceroy continued that the finaucial burden which would be entailed by the continuance of indefinite relations with. Afghanistan would oblige them sooner or later to enter on some such treaty as that which he now advocated. The present critical juncture in the Indian situation disposed him towards trying it now with immediate advantage, and probably better relations in the future. If His Majesty&apos;s Government could see their way to forego the disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty, he felt confident that the remaining obstacles could be surmounted and the lengthy negotiations successfully concluded. He suggested that Sir Henry Dobbs could explain that the diminution in the power of the Soviet Government for evil or other-wise no longer made the disclosure of the treaty a matter of vital interest to us, and that the Amirs written assurance, that the treaty and secret clauses contained nothing directed against His Majesty&apos;s Government or that of India, would satisfy us.The Secretary of State telegraphed [Nos. 5225, 5226, 5227].to the Viceroy on 13th October in acknowledgment of the, above, asking him to consider the matter again in the light of the observations he was then sending. He invited a comparison between the beneficial effects on the frontier and internal situation, which the Viceroy expected from a treaty such as he advocated, and the advantages to be derived from the alternative proposed by himself in his telegram of 7th October. He suggested also that the waning effects of Soviet friendship and the exchange of Ministers in London and Kabul would go to diminish the risk which the Viceroy apprehended. His Majesty&apos;s Government might be ready to acquiesce in the immediate conclusion of some form of pis oiler such as the Government of India were aiming at, but there appeared to be little chance of the Afghans accepting this without our forgoing the disclosure of the Soviet treaty. To drop the demand for disclosure, whatever might be its value as such or as a test of Afghan good faith, cotdd not fail to be considered a climb down &quot; of a very detrimental nature. After discussing the views on both sides the Secretary of State gave it as his opinion that the Viceroy&apos;s proposal, involving the dropping of the demand, for disclosure, could only be justified by immediate apprehensions as to the result on the frontier and on the internal situation of a rupture or failure to conclude a treaty.The Viceroy replied to the above on 17th October acknowledging the value of the Secretary of State&apos;s arguments, but pointing out that the alternative proposed would not provide immediate relief for the military expenditure on the frontier, compared with which the proposed subsidy was a trifle. Nor would it be easy to persuade the public that it was other than a Soviet victory. Discussing the question of disclosure, the Viceroy contended that the position had entirely altered since the disclosure was regarded as a sine qua non, and that negotiations had entered on an entirely new phase, which justified our waiving the demand. Sir Henry Dobbs might be safely trusted to give a satisfactory explanation if necessary, and to him should be left the manner and means of approaching the offer of a treaty of friendship. The Viceroy begged that His Majesty&apos;s Government would allow the offer of the treaty without insistence on disclosure. He based his own insistence on his desire to avoid failure, on account of the stimulating effect it would have on Mohameclans and extremists in India, and the continued heavy military expenditure which it would entail.Telegraphing [53231 on 19th October the Secretary of State asked for a somewhat more detailed appreciation of the reduction of military expenditure which it was anticipated would result from the conclusion of a treaty.On 20th October the Viceroy transmitted a message from Sir Henry Dobbs saying that the Amir was growing impatient, and had personally telephoned to ask the cause of delay.The Viceroy&apos;s Reports. The following report was sent on 13th October :  1. United Provinces.   The political outlook continues to present a calmer surface, but there is.a general conviction that the caliphate movement is more and more inclined to go below the. surface, and that it will require to be carefully watched.88-4 B
The attempt made by Mati Lai Nehru to convene a demonstration at Ajudirya of cultivators against the Oudh Rent Bill proved a failure.Bombay. It is too early yet to gauge the effects of the caliphate prosecutions on the movement in Sind, which had increased in violence since the Karachi conference in July. A number of prosecutions under the security sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure are in progress.Bengal. The non-co-operation movement appears for the moment to be losing influence. Meetings organized in Calcutta to consider the arrest of the caliphate leaders failed to attract an audience. The influence of well-known local leaders is on the wane. The propaganda against non-co-operation is gaining force ,and fresh adherents in certain districts. The speech of the vice-chancellor of the Calcutta university, exposing the effect of non-co-operation on the Bengal educational institutions, has had a good effect. A. remarkable letter on behalf of tbe Assam-Bengal railway strikes at Ohandpur, published on 30th September, makes bitter (? allegations) against the non-co-operation leaders, who are accused of having made labourers strike for political reasons, of treating them as pawns in the game of politics, and of sacrificing them to the prestige of the leaders.Punjab. Speeches made by prominent agitators are increasing in (? venom), and references to the early departure of the British from India are becoming more common. The Sikh movement is showing more activity in Lahore, where there is a close connexion between some Sikh agitators and the caliphate extremists.Burma, The local Government is certain that the Whyte committee will be boycotted by the Burmese Association, which is to hold its conference at Mandalay shortly. The meeting held in Rangoon on .17th September, to consider the caliphate arrests, had to be dispersed by the police, the European officers of which were somewhat severely handled.Section 2. This incident caused some panic among a section of Anglo-Indians. The principal speaker at this meeting, Abdulla Khan Miseri, was sent to jail on 22nd September in default of giving security. After his trial, a European police inspector who was separated from his men -was attacked by the mob but rescued.Section 3. Bihar and Orissa, The boycott of liquor shops has revived in Tirhut and is accompanied by more violence than before. One effect of it is the rapid development of illicit distillation in the wilder parts of the province. The position in the East Indian railway workshops at Jamalpur is causing some anxiety owing to the efforts of the agitators to excite the workmen. There are some indications that the nomco-operation campaign will be renewed in a more intensive form about the end of October. The appointment of so-called national officers of various kinds and grades is increasing. But the barren, effects of the movement up to date is against any large revival, and Gandhi has lost prestige since the beginning of the year. Moreover, the Moplah rising has been a serious warning, and quarrels amongst the local leaders are coinmon.Section 4. The Delhi meetings of the Jainiat id Ulema and the central caliphate committee, 21st to 24th September, have caused a recrudescence of Mohamedan exeite-ment. The pronouncements of the proscribed fatwa were endorsed, and the fatwa is being reproduced and distributed. Wild speeches at&apos;the meetings of the 27th and 29th led to the arrest of the two principal speakers, one of them being a nephew of Dr. Ansari. The latter has since announced that no more meetings are to be held in October, and the local authorities hope that the excitement regarding the proscribed fatwa will soon subside.Section 5. General.-Nearly all the provinces report that the arrest of the caliphate leaders caused comparatively little excitement, though there is a general tendency to repeat the resolution for the passing of which the leaders are being (? pro-secutecl) in many places all over India. In some provinces the arrests have distracted attention from the failure of Gandhi&apos;s efforts to boycott foreign cloth. On the other hand the custodian of the Durga Sharif at Ajmere, a shrine greatly visited by Moslems from all parts of northern India, was very pessimistic in recent conversation with the commissioner. He expressed the view that, if the Prince visited the shrine, he would risk the chance of being insulted, as the young men were getting worse daily, and more out of control of the elders. Feeling was very bitter, and. there was much wild talk of jehad all over the north of India. If the Ali brothers were convicted he thought that there would be a campaign of retaliation in. the form of murder of high officials.        . .
Section 6. The congress working committee, at its meeting in Bombay on 7th. October, at which Gandhi was present, passed a resolution that on. the day of the landing of the Prince at Bombay there should be a general voluntary hartal throughout India. Arrangements to ensure an effective boycott of public welcome to the Prince at other places were left to the provincial congress committees. The working com-mittee would not authorize general civil disobedience in any locality where the boycott of foreign cloth was not effective, but it authorized civil disobedience by individuals who may be prevented in the prosecution of the swadeshi propaganda, provided the individuals act under the authority of the provincial congress committee, and that the provincial committee is assured that a non-violent atmosphere will be retained.The Governor of Bombay, on the Moslem Situation. The following telegram was sent by Sir George Lloyd to the Secretary of State on 15th October : - -In view of the present situation in India, I feel bound to urge once more upon you my. opinion that it is imperative that action should be taken on the Turkish question, which should restore the lost faith of Islam in our attitude towards it. My point of view, and my anxiety to assist in this question, is well known to you from various private letters and telegrams that&quot;have reached you from me, but once again an opportunity, so it seems to me, presents itself in the exhaustion of both the combatants in Anatolia, and in other factors of the situation which should be taken immediate advantage of to put England&apos;s position right. In regard to the above,,I have all along held the view that, shorn of the caliphate question, the non-co-operation movement is easily settled, but so long as all Moslems in India are either actively hostile or sore and distrustful, as they are at present, the situation will remain serious.We have now for very many months tried by patience and firmness to save the-situation from becoming worse out here, but I can only repeat what I have so often urged, that unless we get back to a policy of reconciliation with Islam the situation in India may at any moment become a grave one.I hope you will not think that I have misread either this situation or the home difficulties ; but I have spent most of my life in studying Islam in Turkey and else-where, and. I am absolutely confident that a continuation of our present policy towards Islam, or what appears to the public to be our policy towards Islam, will lead to results fatal to our rule in the East.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.Washington Conference. The Governor-General telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 25th October : A minute of council has been approved appointing Sir Robert Borden to represent Canada at the forthcoming conference to be held at Washington on 11th November,-and Mr. L. G. Christie member of the secretariat of the British Empire delegation.AUSTRALIA.Imports and Exports. The Official Secretary in London advises that the values of the goods imported to and exported from Australia during the months of July and August 1921 were as follows:  Imports. July: 7,(J06,5f)2L   August: 7,341,355LExports. July: Australian produce,  7,824,363L ;  other produce,  423,935 . total, 8,248,2931.   August: Australian produce, 7,90.1,204-L ; other produce, 490,5231. ; total, 8,391,7871.SOUTH AFRICA.The following items of information were telegraphed by ReuteFs agents : Parliament.-Pretoria, 7th October. Parliament, which was originally prorogued till 14th October, has now been further prorogued till 9th December.33-4 C r
Mozambique Convention. Pretoria, 20th October. Speaking at a banquet given here to-day by the commercial congress, General Smuts, the Prime Minister, dealing with the Mozambique Convention, said the Union Government were agreed that the time had come for a radical revision thereof. Circumstances, he added, had very largely altered in the last 12 years. To-day the question of the import traffic was small compared with the question of the export traffic. They recognized, continued General Smuts, the close community of interest between themselves and Mozambique. The Transvaal could not reach her true destiny without the closest co-operation with Mozambique because outlets, to the Indian Ocean were essential to her. Dealing with the allegations that the Union had not kept its part of the bargain, especially as regards railway traffic, General Smuts declared that the Union was most anxious to discharge its duties, and pointed out the effect of the war on the traffic via. Delagoa Bay, which was, however, now speedily reviving.Concluding, General Smuts expressed the hope that the Union and Mozambique would march forward together to that great destiny before South Africa, and more and more look upon themselves not as two different countries, but as one undivided country with the same interest in the world.Co-operation. Pretoria, 15th October. A conference representative of the principal co-operative organizations of the Union under the chairmanship of Sir Thomas Smartt is now considering the draft of a Co-operation Bill for the Union.Opening the proceedings, General Smuts appealed most strongly to the farmers to organize and co-operate, pointing out that the Union&apos;s principal industries were in the gravest peril &quot; mainly because we are unorganized. Our exports are suffering because, while other countries are well organized, we are facing the post-war storm in a totally unorganized condition. South Africa is entering a new epoch of far more rapid development than in the past. Our future lies in becoming a great producing country.&quot;General Smuts said the Government was willing to help to the uttermost and prepared to support any measure recommended by the conference in Parliament, but emphasized that self-help was necessary.Capetown, 13th October. The movement among farmers in favour of.organization and co-operation is gaining ground, and the necessity for concerted action as regards the export trade is widely urged.In this connexion, the maize and citrous fruit growers have recently been most active, and the tobacco growers wil^ probably take to heart the advice of Mr. Burton, the Minister of Finance, who in his speech at Pretoria yesterday urged co-operation among the tobacco growers in catering for the export market by the skilled handling of produce. The latest scheme for the protection of farmers&apos; interests was outlined by General Hertzog at the Free State Nationalist congress. He urged farmers to run their own bank, declaring that farmers should be &quot; independent of the foreign capital with which the majority of the banks worked.&quot;Miners&apos; Wages. Johannesburg, 17th October. The decision of the Miners&apos; Union to take immediate action with a view to upsetting the wages agreement concluded last July and to take a strike ballot, came as a bomb-shell to the general public. Apparently, however, the trouble elates back to the ballot in July, which narrowly resulted in the acceptance of the ChambeFs terms for a reduction of wages.The ballot figures have been kept secret, but it is&apos; unofficially stated that the engine-drivers&apos; vote in favour of the acceptance was the deciding factor. The Enginemen&apos;s Society then entered into negotiations with the Chamber of Mines, which agreed to guarantee the wages of certain classes of drivers until the end of the year. In view of this action the joint executive of all the mining unions have now decided in favour of a reversion to the wages position existing in July. The dispute is complicated, but these are generally accepted to be the facts of the position.It appears that the Industrial Federation has not communicated the miners&apos; decision to the Chamber owing to their very strong disapproval of it.The owners&apos; offer which was accepted by the Joint Executive of the Trade Unions of the mining industry at the close of July last involved the consolidation with wages of 21s. of the allowance of 21. :8s. granted 18 months ago instead of the 24s. asked by the men, the remainder of the allowance to be subject to variations in the cost of living.Industrial Situation on the Rand. Johannesburg, 17th October. The industrial situation on the Rand is again clouding over.   In addition to the general raising of
the question of miners&apos; wages, the workers of the East Rand proprietary mines threaten to cease work to-morrow afternoon as a protest against the employment of a non-unionist. The attitude of the Chamber of Mines, as previously affirmed, is-that it -cannot coerce any employee to join or leave a trade union. Unfortunately the matter in. dispute admits of no reference to any joint board. The question of the stabilization of the wages of stationary engine-drivers until the end of the year has assumed a threatening aspect. The Chamber, while willing to stabilize the wages of certificated winding engine drivers, declines to do likewise for stationary engine-drivers. The men contend that the Chamber verbally agreed at the conference in February last to stabilize the wages of all engine-drivers and demand compliance with these alleged terms of agreement and threaten, otherwise to take action. On the top of these disquieting events comes the news that it has been decided to close down as gradually as possible.Table Bay Docks. Capetown, 11th October. The general opinion that an improvement and extension of Table Bay docks is urgently necessary has been confirmed by the report of a special committee of enquiry. Besides outlining the vital immediate requirements such as greatly improved facilities, especially as regards coaling and additional deep water berths, the report of the committee recommends the adoption of an immediate scheme of extension on the southern side of the existing clocks to cost 3,500,000?. sterling, spread over a period of 10 years. This would allow the full southern scheme, at an additional.cost of 3,O00,00OZ., to be carried out later if necessary.Contract for Grain Elevators. Capetown, 15th October. According to infor-mation from an official source, it has been decided, subject to certain formalities, to place the whole contract for the erection of 36 grain elevators with the Canadian firm of A. W. Menkins.It is understood that the greater part of the machinery will be purchased in Great Britain, but almost the whole cost of the building, other than that for structural steel, will be expended in South Africa.The South-West Africa Protectorate. Capetown, 12th October. The Adminis-trator of the South-West protectorate, Mr. G. R. Hofmeyr, has been conferring with the Cabinet in Pretoria on a number of administrative questions. Interviewed by ReuteFs correspondent at Upington on. his way to Windhoek, Mr. Plofmeyr stated that he was about entirely to reconstruct the land settlement policy in such a way that settlers would be allowed more time and facilities for the repayment of any Govern-ment advances. The Cabinet had decided that a legislative council should be established at an early date and had dealt with financial problems so that the finances of the territory are*now on a firm basis. With reference to the natives, Mr. Ilofmeyr said that a limited form of segregation would be introduced, which would be in the best interests of the natives themselves.
