GREAT BRITAIN.Unemployment Situation. The following summary of the situation is taken from the special report on unemployment for the period beginning 19th August and ending 1st September, issued by the Ministry of Labour : Very little change is shown in the engineering industry; suspensions of work-people have taken place iu the motor trade in the Midlands Division. The iron and steel industry still remains generally slack, but signs of improvement continue in the Midlands Division. In the coal-mining industry a tendency for the better is shown, both in Scotland and Wales. The improvement in the North-Eastern Division previously reported is maintained. Shipbuilding and ship repairing is still quiet; in the North-Eastern Division orders are becoming increasingly scarce ; a slight revival is, however, apparent in London, owing to the return to work of men unemployed on account of a recent trade dispute.Employment in the cotton and textile industry is good in Scotland ; many mills in the North-Western Division, however, have extended the annual holidays. The mills in this division controlled by the Fine Spinners&apos; Association continue to maintain full production. In Scotland Division and the Midlands Division the position of the hosiery trade is very favourable. The woollen and worsted industries in the North-Easteru Division appear to maintain the improvement previously reported.The building industry appears generally to be becoming quieter with the approach of winter; in the South-Western Division, however, it continues brisk, and some demand for painters and decorators is reported from London. The depression in the linen trade in Scotland continues, with no indication of any improvement. The jute industry in this division is also showing signs of further slackening off. There is no general resumption of work among pottery workers in the Midlands since the annual holidays, owing to shortage of orders. The lace trade in this division is also very depressed. Unemployment in the glass trade in the North-Eastern Division is increasing. Some revival of the brick-making industry is reported from the South-Western Division, chiefly on account of materials required for the HaLvill-Torrington Light Railway.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.IRAQ.The following extracts are taken from the 10th Iraq Intelligence Report, dated 15th August: Internal Unrest. A dangerous recrudescence of extremist agitation has marked the last fortnight, the feasts of Kurbau Bairam and the Ghadir affording favourable opportunities for meeting in the holy cities. The main demands which have been formulated are (1) the resignation of the Cabinet, (2) the rejection of the mandate and the treaty, (3) the removal of British provincial advisers. There is some talk of the substitution of Abdulla for Feisal since the latter is declared not to have complied with the conditions on which he was elected. Demonstrations are contemplated on the anniversary of his enthronement, 23rd August.Tribal Dissensions. The bitter dissensions roused between the tribes by the action of Arab officials have led to the suspension of administration in the Hillah Liwa. Tho Government has fallen into contempt, the tribes are arming and in Diwaniyah district rebuilding their war towers. In the Muntafiq, where an unsettled agrarian question is at the bottom of tribal unrest, the unsympathetic attitude of the former Mutasarrif, who openly backed the landlord faction, has inspired the tribes with a deep mistrust of Arab Government, which Yasin Pasha is finding it difficult to overcome. In both divisions, if the present state of political tension continues, widespread disorders are to be feared. While the danger zone on the Euphrates is larger than it was in 1920, when Muntafiq stood out, the forces at the command of Government are considerably smaller. On the other hand the leading Mujtahids have as yet abstained from political pronouncements and the pro-British shaikhs are an asset on the side of order.
Resignation of the Cabinet. The demand for the dissolution of the Cabinet has the scarcely veiled sympathy of the King. The Ministers, feeling themselves to be in a false position, asked him for an expression of his confidence in them. He gave an ambiguous reply and the whole Cabinet, with the exception of the Naqib, resigned. This episode is naturally regarded as a point scored by the agitators.Position on the Frontier. -Although Karim Fattah Beg and possibly Saiyid Muhammad Jabbari have been driven out of Sulaimani aud have taken refuge with the Turks, tbe position on the Pauiia frontier has deteriorated. The Kemalists, after two months&apos; preparation, are moving clown through Shaur and Naodasht. The defeat of Simko by the Persians will remove the pressure which he exerted usefully on the frontier tribes and has immediately postponed the proposed interview between Saiyid Whithall and the Assistant Political Officer, Eania.Boundary Adjustment-An arrangement has been reached with the French Government regarding the protection of caravans on the Mosul Dair road. A. reconsideration of the present unsatisfactory frontier is urgent. A French patrol has visited a police post established by the Iraq Government beyond the Convention boundary. The police were temporarily absent. The patrol pulled down the Iraq signpost.Ibn Saud&apos;s Correspondence. The High Commissioner has received three letters from Ibn Sand, the first repudiating the report that he had made a treaty with the French, the second asking that the British Consul may act provisionally as his agent in Damascus, to the exclusion of Ibn Asaimi, while the third is a strongly worded protest against Mr. Philby&apos;s expedition to JobTHE DOMINIONS.The United States of America and C. Mandate Territories. On 30th August the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governors-General of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, referring to his despatch of 1st September 1921, and transmitting a note on tbe subject of C. Mandates received from the United States Ambassador, of which the following is a summary : The Government of the United States of America repeat the four suggestions made in the memorandum of 24th August 1921, and quote the statement of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the notes of 22nd December and 29th December, that it has never been the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to deprive the United States of the rights and privileges to which they are entitled as the result of the common victory over Germany, and, in particular, that they disclaim the intention to discriminate against the United States nationals and companies. In view of these assurances the Government of the United States of America assumed that there would be no disposition to deny to the United States in the 0. Mandate territories any guarantees appropriate for safeguarding present, or prospective United States interests, and, in particular, that no action would be taken prior to the assent of the United States to the mandate which would be discriminatory, or otherwise contrary to the spirit of the expected guarantees. Nevertheless, there are certain circumstances recently brought to notice, which appear to the United States Government to justify immediate enquiry. As to these 1 am telegraphing separately. The United States Government also refer to the Japanese agreement to furnish a duplicate, and not a copy, of the annual report to be submitted to the League on the administration of mandated territories, and assume that there-is-no objection to a similar procedure as regards the C. Mandate territories administered by the Dominions. Pending a definite agreement they would be glad to receive duplicates of the reports submitted. The United States Government hope that until the treaty is concluded relating to the 0. Mandate territories no action will be taken of a monopolistic or discriminatory character, or otherwise prejudicial to the United States&apos; rights and interests.The Secretary of State added : Your Ministers will observe that the British Notes of 22nd December and 29th December, quoted by the Government of the United States of America, dealt with the B. and A. Mandates only.44-2 A 2
AUSTRALIA.G. Mandates. Referring to Iris telegram of the same date (see under Dominions, p. 3), the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following telegram to the Governor-General of Australia on 30th August: The instances quoted hy the Government of the United States of America include :-(1) The regulations of 22nd February as to the sale of enemy property, apparentlyapplicable to New Guinea, prohibiting sale to purchasers other than Britishsubjects or companies. (2) The statement made by the Commonwealth Parliament, 22nd November 1921,that it was their purpose to reserve the oil deposits of New Guinea for the exclusive use of the mandatory authorities.As to the former question, representations have also been received from the Government of Germany.   See my despatch 18th August.Trade [B.E.R., lxxiv, p. 5]. According to information emanating from the office of the High Commissioner in London, the value of the imports for the month of July was 9,708,6731, and that of the exports 8,132,4442., of which all but 267,6512. was Australian produce.NEW ZEALAND.G. Mandates. The Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governor-General of Newr Zealand on 30th August, with reference to his telegram of the same date (sea under Dominions, p. 3), as follows : The instances of alleged discrimination quoted by the Government of the United States of America include preferential tariff for western Samoa, see your despatch 13th June 1921.SOUTH AFRICA.C. Mandates. The\ following telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General of South Africa, referring to his telegram of the same date (see under Dominions, p. 3), was sent on 30th August: The instances quoted by the Government of the United States of America include the Union Customs Duties Amendment Act, 1921, which contemplates that mandated territory should be regarded for customs purposes as part of the Union.. The United States Government observe that in view of the tariff preference accorded by the Union to other parts of the Empire, this involves discrimination in South-West Africa, and ask that if such legislation is maintained, United States goods imported there may be given any benefits or preferences accorded to any other similar goods.The following items of information were telegraphed by ReuteFs agents :  The Diamond Industry. In connexion with the recent reports of an alleged &quot; corner&quot; in diamonds, a prominent member of the diamond buying syndicate declared that he was ignorant of any attempt to &quot; corner &quot; stones. The speaker-admitted that the demand for stones was improving and that there was a prospect of better days for the industry in the not distant future.   [Kimberley, 25th August,]African Inter-Golonicd Trade. The Gape Times announces that as a preliminary to a larger investigation of trade possibilities in the African continent, the Union Government is about to despatch a trade mission to Kenya. The mission will be composed of representatives of the Government and the mercantile and industrial communities of South Africa, and will endeavour to ascertain how the natural exchange of commodities between the two countries can be directed into permanent, trade channels.Although the mission&apos;s activities will for the present be confined to Kenya, there is, the journal states, good reason to believe that the scope of its enquiries will eventually be extended to Uganda, Tanganyika, the Belgian Congo and even Angola.. [Capetown, 30th August.]
Rhodesia.The Referendum. On 1st September the High Commissioner for South Africa telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows :-The Resident Commissioner, Southern Rhodesia, reports that the Administrator has fixed, by notice in the Gazette, 27th October as the date of the referendum. All votes will be counted at Salisbury, and the Resident Commissioner thinks that the result should be known a week after the referendum.The following was transmitted by Reuter&apos;s agent:  Rhodesia&apos;s Finances. The responsible Government party has issued a long manifesto containing its objections to the Union of Rhodesia with the Union of South Africa, including the absence of any security that the terms would be fulfilled should another political party in the Union attain power. In connection with financial policy under the responsible Government, it is suggested that a loan-of 1,500,0002. would be sufficient, of which 650,0001. would be for payment on public buildings, 300,0001. to repay the Imperial loan, 300.000Z. for the Land Bank, and 250,0001. for immediate needs in new buildings, &amp;c. This, with 30,000Z. to meet the cost of extra legislation, would mean an annual additional charge of 108,000Z./which it is proposed to cover by a tax on unoccupied and undeveloped land of \ \ per cent, on valuation and by raising the transfer duty to 4 per cent.
