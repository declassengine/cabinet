GREAT BRITAIN.Unemployment Situation. The following summary of the situation is taken from the special report on unemployment for the period 16th to 29th September issued by the Ministry of Labour : In the coal-mining industry the improvement previously recorded continues in most districts. In the north-eastern division some slight improvement has occurred in the iron and steel industry, but prospects are not quite so hopeful as formerly. The position in the Midlands is fairly good, but the situation in Wales is complicated by the dispute in the Ebbw Vale area. In shipbuilding and ship repairing depression remains the rule. Engineering continues quiet, and the motor-cycle and motor-car sections in particular are experiencing the effects of seasonal depression.The prospects in the woollen and worsted industry in the Scotland division remain bright, but in the north-eastern division what previously appeared to be a hopeful outlook has. not materialized. The cotton industry remains unsettled, but, apart from the effect of the crisis in the Near East, the tendency is towards slow improvement. Depression exists in the lace industry in the south-western division. In Scotland there has been, a slight decrease in trade in cotton and textiles, while the linen and jute industries remain, at a low level.The building industry remains quiet generally, and although in the south-eastern division prospects appear brighter, any exceptional improvement may be counter-balanced to some extent by seasonal depression. Reports received from the north-eastern division on the glass industry are discouraging, but some improvement due to seasonal causes is apparent in the Midlands. The Welsh tinplate industry is very depressed, and the copper and spelter works in that area are stated to be in a very precarious state.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.KENYA COLONY.East African Customs Arrangements. Telegraphing from Nairobi on 27th September Renter&apos;? agent reported that at a special session of the Legislature that day it was announced that Uganda had come into line with the Kenya Colony in the matter of customs duties. The new Customs Bill had been introduced and would be referred to the Tanganyika Territory in the hope that an agreement would be reached with the latter too. There were few changes in the duties, except that all passenger&apos;s luggage would enter free and that there was a heavy reduction in the duty on spirits and &quot;a heavy increase in that on matches.IRAQ.The following paragraphs form the summary of the 17th Iraq Intelligence Report, dated 1st September: Resignation of the Naqib. At the request of the King, the Naqib tendered his resignation on 19th August. He was informed by the secretary of the royal diwan that it was His Majesty&apos;s intention to ask him to form a new Cabinet, provided that he would first provide the King with a political programme on certain specified heads. It was generally believed, that the King did not desire the return of the Naqib, and would delay his resumption of office by taking exception to points in his reply. The correspondence was still in progress when His Majesty&apos;s illness intervened.Hostile Demonstration. The political position on  he middle and lower Euphrates&apos; had approached a situation of considerable gravity and the Diyala Liwa was reported to be sympathetically affected, while in Baghdad the moderate party formed under &quot;Saiyid Mahmud was discouraged by the fall of the latter&apos;s father, the Naqib. On the anniversary of the King&apos;s accession, 23rd August, the two extremist parties made a demonstration in the courtyard of the royal diwan, timed to coincide with the appearance of the High Commissioner at the levee.   His Excellency sent a vigorous protest to
His Majesty on 24th August, and received a full apology in reply. The King was on that day suffering from an attack of appendicitis, which necessitated an operation. This was successfully performed on 25th August, and His Majesty is now out of danger, though unable to attend to business.High Commissioner&apos;.? Prompt Action. In the absence of a Cabinet followed by the temporary eclipse of the King,&apos; the High Commissioner took immediate action. On 26th August certain leaders of the extremist parties were arrested, the two extremist political parties suspended, and the two extremist papers closed down. On. the same evening His Excellency informed the public of the reasons for and scope of the measures which had been taken. This announcement produced an excellent effect both in Baghdad and in the provinces. No movement hostile to Government has been made, and in the middle Euphrates the tribal agitators are making-submission. There is no reason to anticipate any disturbance, while the departure of -Saiyid Muhammad Sadr and Shaikh Muhammad Mahdi al Khalisi for Persia, at His P-lxcelleucy&apos;s suggestion, has removed the most dangerous religious agitators.Position on the Frontier. The position on the fiania frontier is grave. The despatch of a small column of imperial troops, together with available levies, to Derbend did not stabilize the situation. The presence of Karim Eattah Beg with Turkish parties advancing through Naodasht and Shaur no doubt encouraged the -Kemalists to hope for tribal support. This they have received, with the result that Rania and Derbend were evacuated on the night of 31st August, and the column is proceeding to Keui Sanjaq.   The evacuation of Sulaimani. is imminent.The following extracts are taken from the 18th Iraq Intelligence Report, dated 15th September : The Kurdish Frontier.- The situation created on the Kurdish frontier by the withdrawal of the column from Rania on 1st September, and the evacuation of all non-moslem government servants from Sulaimani by air on 5th September, has during the last 10 days taken a more favourable turn. The administration in Sulaimani was entrusted to Shaikh Qadir, brother of Shaikh Mahmud, and the elective Council, which was further strengthened by the co-option of additional Aghawat of the town and supported by the Sulaimani levies and police. Shaikh Qadir has been able to hold his own against Karim Fattah Beg, who appeared in the town immediately after the evacuation and is now leading the pro-Turk party in opposition to the declared policy of the provisional administration that they will maintain the status quo aud the connexion with His Majesty&apos;s Government. The hostile Pizhder have declared themselves satisfied with the present arrangement, and have broken with the Kemalists, while the news of: Shaikh QadiFs appointment had a quieting effect on the Khushnao. Shaikh Mahmud, who had previously been summoned from Kuwait, arrived in Baghdad on 12th September. He showred some -diffidence at the prospect of taking over, but was reassured by an interview with His -Excellency the High Commissioner. He has asked that Major Noel may return with -him at Sulaimani, but His Excellency has pointed out that no British officer can go to Sulaimani wdiile Karim Fattah Beg is still at large, a decision which Shaikh Mahmud accepted.   He aud Major Noel wdll proceed to Kifri. &amp;Situation in the Provinces. The political situation in Muntafiq, Diwaniyah. and Hillah has greatly improved since the publication of His Excellency the High Com-missionePs announcement. The shaikhs and saiyids who led the agitation in the liillah division have all come to heel. Two further arrests have been made : Abdul Rasid Kubbah, who was one of the original, seven, and Ha bib al Khaizaran, ex-shaikh , of the Azzah, who was engaged in pro-Turkish propaganda.King FeisaVs Recovery. His Majesty the King was officially declared fit to take part in affairs of state on 10th September. In an interview with His Excellency the High Commissioner on that day he agreed to thank him in writing for the action taken by him during His Majesty&apos;s illness. This letter was received by His Excellency on the following day. His Majesty has also agreed to ask the Naqib to form a new Cabinet as soon as a declaration of policy has been received from His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Turkish Victory. The news of the Turkish victory in Anatolia gives general satisfaction, except with the genuine Arab Nationalists, who regard anattack -on Mosul by the Kemalists as a foregone conclusion.
INDIA.The Fortnightly Report. The following is the report from the Government of India for the fortnight ended 29th September : Madras. There has been practically no political activity. Muharram passed off quietly everywhere. The spread of congress propaganda by door-to-door visits is reported from a part of Guntur, where also it is said that non-co-operation candidates are making a bid for control over local bodies. The Turkish successes in Asia Minor were hailed with delight, and special prayers have been offered in the more important mosques. The extremist press makes no attempt to conceal its satisfaction at what it regards as a blow to the prestige of Great Britain.An Outbreak has occurred in the Agency Tracts. The country is difficult, the weather is bad and the police have not yet succeeded in effecting contact with the insurgents, except once, when a small body of police was surprised, and had to retire, leaving one of their number. The gang is now believed to be not more than 80 or 100. strong, and police forces should have no difficulty in dealing with it when they can locate it- definitely. A news agency telegram just received states that Mr. Scott-Coward, A.S.P., was shot dead by a gang in ambush in the Gudem hills, and that three constables are reported missing. (A later message says that two assistant superintendents of police lost their lives.)Bombay. News of Turkish successes were received with great satisfaction and rejoicing by all sections cf mohamedans. At present there is an attitude of expectancy of an early and favourable settlement of the Near East question. The commissioner of police reports praiseworthy restraint and moderation of mohamedan expectations.On the other hand, the publicity department, central caliphate committee, has published a warning that no settlement which does not free Jazirat-ul-arab from foreign domination will be acceptable to luohamedaus.Bengal. Owing to the release of the more prominent leaders of the non-co-operation party, there is a certain amount of enthusiasm. These leaders are visiting the districts and speaking in order to revive enthusiasm and to augment the dwindling funds of the congress and caliphate movements. The tone of the speeches is objectionable, and proceedings are being taken in some cases. These attempts have met with little response, owing to the postponement of the report of the civil disobedience committee. ,Picketing continues to be reported from some districts, but on a small scale. In some districts propaganda work for the popularization of khaddar is being pushed on vigorously.   Muharram passed off quietly except in one or two places.The Turkish victories in Asia Minor and the British attitude are the cause of great excitement amongst all mohamedans. Much will depend on the future action of the Kemalists and the attitude of tlie Powers. The number of ex-detenus who have been returned as district representatives on the provincial congress committee is disquieting. The congress in the districts is more and more passing into the hands of former prominent revolutionaries. There are clear indications that many of these are imbued wdth the doctrines of the Vanguard (a communist paper published in Germany).United Provinces. There has been no change of importance in the political situation. The western districts are too near Punjab unrest to be unaffected. The Turkish victories have stirred mohamedans everywhere.Muharram passed off quietly, save for a small riot at Allahabad, but growing hostility between hindus and mohamedans is manifesting itself in many localities. Tho debate in the Legislative Assembly on the Prime Ministers speech has not made for political tranquillity.Punjab. The mother of the Ali brothers, the wife of Mohamed Ali, and the son of Shaukat Ali, are touring the Punjab and delivering somewhat inflammatory lectures, which have not, however, caused much excitement. Prayers are being offered for the success of the Turkish arms and much satisfaction at the Turkish success is expressed. Paid lecturers are delivering violent speeches in spite of numerous prosecutions. The number of political meetings is steadily increasing, while the picketing of liquor shops continues in a half-hearted manner iii Rawalpindi, but is suspended in Jhelum.Bihar and Orissa. The non-co-operation movement for the moment is in low water. It is losing ground in Patna, and difficulty is experienced in raising money.   In
Shahabad a general collapse of the movement is evident. Purnea reports a revulsion of feeling amongst the masses, who show resentment against the wrong guidance of non-co-operators. Mutual recrimination among local leaders is accompanied as a rule by charges of embezzlement. The Turkish victories have stirred mohamedan feeling to some extent. Special prayers are being offered in the mosques. The feeling between hindus and mohamedans tends, to intensify. Muharram, however, passed off without serious disturbance.Central Provinces. A temporary fillip to political agitation has been given by elections for various congress committees. There have been a few prosecutions under section 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The non-co-operation party is divided against itself at Jubbulpur. At a few centres there has been some revival of a spasmodic nature of the picketing of liquor shops. The movement, for the boycott of foreign cloth makes no progress.Muharram passed, off quietly, but there was practically no sign of fraternization between hindus and mohamedans as occurred last year. Considerable interest was shown in the Turkish victories, and in the majority of districts congratulatory meetings were held.Assam. There is nothing of special importance to report. Special prayers were offered in the mosques on account of the Turkish victories.Delhi. There is little of special interest. Muharram passed off without incident. Considerable pseudo-religious rejoicing over the Turkish victories has been shown. Thanksgiving prayers were offered in the mosques. The Delhi sikhs are evincing interest in the akalis at Amritsar.Nortu-West Frontier Province. A very seditious speech was made by the young, moulvi Ibrahim, of Lahore, at Peshawar, at a largely attended meeting, but orders have been issued for his removal under the Frontier Security Regulations. The mother of the Ali brothers and party have been served with orders of exclusion. Sikh affairs are attracting attention.Burma. Moderate Burmese politicians are showing signs of weakening; they have offered to abide by the decision of the monastic councils, to which Chit PIlaing&apos;s party has made no definite response. A coalition party, including Europeans, Burmans and Indians, is preparing to issue a manifesto which may lead to a moderate split. One section is joining the coalition and the other the extremists. Upper Burma is suffering from a wave of extremism, appealing chiefly to hopes of the revival of the Burmese dynasty. The boycott continues to spread, and the Anti-Boycott Act has been extended to two districts. The Turkish success has revived mohamedan agitation. Eudeavours have been made in various meetings held to inflame religious feeling by a comparison between the state of Christianity and mohamedanism. The sikh community is not yet much affected by the events of Guru-ka-Bagh, but the extremists are trying to stir up feelings.General. The political situation shows little change. Interest chiefly centres in the Turkish success in Asia Minor, and there is much jubilation amongst mohamedans, some of whom have hopes of raising an Angora legion. If negotiations now in progress break down, and British and Turkish forces come, into conflict, the effects on mohamedan feeling cannot fail to be very serious.The sessions of the Legislatures concluded to-day. The Police Disaffection Bill was passed, but the term of imprisonment provided in the Bill was reduced to six months. On 23rd September the Legislative Assembly refused leave to introduce the Bill to protect Princes from attacks calculated to promote disaffection against them or their Government. The Bill was certified, under section 67b of the Government of India Act, by His Excellency the Viceroy on 2-lth September, and was laid before the Council of state on the 26th. There was hardly any opposition to the Bill in the Council of State. A motion to take it into consideration was passed unanimously. The amendments moved by two members were summarily rejected, and the final motion that the Bill be passed was accepted without a division, and with only one dissentient. There is good reason to believe that many members of the Assembly who voted against the motion to introduce the Bill now realize that the action of the Assembly in rejecting this motion was a grave blunder, and would have welcomed, had this been possible, the re-introduction of the Bill in the Assembly. Whilst the extremist press will, no doubt, endeavour to make capital out of the use of the Viceroy&apos;s power of certification, it is probable that Indian opinion as a wdiole will recognize that the action of the Assembly made this inevitable, and it is unlikely that there will be any serious agitation in consequence.45-2 , B
GIndia and tlie Near Bast.-On 3rd October the Viceroy telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State,:-In view of the critical situation at the present juncture in the Near East, we &apos; consider it necessary to inform you of the state of Indian feeling on this subject. What we have to say is largely a resume of previous communications, but we think it desirable that the position in this respect should be clearly summarized for your information.(1) Mohamedans throughout India have been profoundly stirred and much pleased by the news of Kemalist victories. The caliphate agitation has been on the wane for some time, its leaders are suspected of being the tools of hindu politicians, subscriptions have practically ceased and its funds are very low. But the enthusiasm for the Angora Government in its struggle with the Greeks has continued unabated. Subscriptions have all along been forthcoming, and the Angora fund has actually a considerable balance in hand at the moment. The Kemalist successes have therefore been received with great rejoicing. In all tho provinces numerous meetings of celebration have been held, mosques have been illuminated, and special prayers for continued success of the Turkish arms have been and. are being offered. In addition, an appeal has been made in the . . . Independent, for the formation of an Angora legion. We have taken steps to make the legal position in regard to this matter clear to the public, and we should not, of course, permit Indians to leave India for the purpose of taking service under Angoras orders. The issue of this appeal, however, is a clear indication of mohamedan feeling. Although there have been a few violent speeches at meetings or in mosques, the manifestations have hitherto been marked by moderation and restraint, and apart from the intransigaut and flamboyant utterances of a few extremists, the expectations entertained have not been extravagant. Combined, however, with elation at the defeat of the Greeks, there is a strong undercurrent of anxiety in regard to the attitude of Great Britain. The efforts of the Government of India in the matter of representing mohamedan views and sentiments to His majesty&apos;s Government are recognized and appreciated, but the general belief is that the Greek operations in Asia Minor were inspired by, and have throughout been dependent on English support, and that while franco and Italy are friendly to Turkish aspirations, the policy of Great Britain has been the one obstacle to a settlement satisfactory to mohamedans. We have done all that is possible to remove these misapprehensions, and to place the policy of His MajestyS Government in its true light, but with little effect. It is now hoped, however, by mohamedans, that the logic of events will be recognized by Great Britain, and that the Turks will-not be robbed of the legitimate fruits of their victories by British; opposition. We have already communicated to you our views as to terms which will satisfy moderate mohamedan opinion.If however, unfortunately, a solution on these lines is not reached, and war between British and Angora Governments breaks out, the effect on mohamedans throughout India will be of a serious character and will materially affect for the worse the whole political situation. The mohamedan agitation during the last three years has undoubtedly been fanned by politicians for their own purposes, but it now rests on genuine religious feelings, especially in the United Provinces and in North-West Frontier Province, which will be deeply stirred in the event of a conflict between the British and Turkish forces.2. As regards the hind us, the position is more complicated. The extremist element welcome any blow to British prestige, and the Kemalist victories are regarded as such by them. There is, however, no real desire on the part of the hindus generally for -the aggrandisement or strengthening of Turkey, with its-consequent increase in mohamedan power and influence ; and the non-co-operators in particular are gravely exercised over the reaction on their own. schemes which a settlement of the Turkish question would undoubtedly involve. This party realizes that the fighting element in their campaign has been very largely furnished by the mohamedans; and they fear with reason, that mohamedau support will be lost if a peace satisfactory on the whole to mohamedans is concluded. As we have before explained, the hindu-mohamedan entente has been essentially a combination of parties whose real aims were profoundly divergent. It has never been more than skin deep, and friction between the two communities, despite desperate efforts by the politicians, as &quot;atMultan, to patch up differences, has recently become too acute to be denied -even by the extremists. The policy of hindu extremists, therefore, is to inflame mohamedan feeling in the hope that thereby any settlement, should any be reached, between the Allies and the Kemalists will be rendered unacceptable to mohamedans, and that mohamedans will be compelled in consequence to maintain the alliance with themselves.
7 !&apos; . STHE DOMINIONS.SOUTH AFRICA.The following information has been transmitted by ReuteFs agents :  South Africa and the Near East. Mr. Tiehnan Roos, the Nationalist leader, referring to the Near East question, declared that the Nationalist party would fight against the sending of a single Afrikander, either English- or Dutch-speaking, to the Near East and against the spending of a single penny.   [Pretoria, 22nd September.]General Smuts&apos;&apos; Reply to the Imperial Government. The Union Governments reply to the Imperial Governments appeal for support in its Near East policy was published to-day. It expresses the opinion that the position has altered materially for the better, and that there is no longer any call for the active intervention of the Union of South Africa. The South African Government is in favour of the main-tenance of the freedom of the Straits being placed under the League of Nations. General Smuts regrets the delay in replying, which he attributes to his being in an inaccessible part of the country.   [Pretoria, 25th September.]New South African University. The Governor-General as Chancellor to-day formally inaugurated the new Witwatersrand University, which incorporates the existing School of Mines and Technology. After an inaugural address by Mr. Duncan, the Minister of the Interior, an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred upon General Smuts.   [Johannesburg, 5th October.]Mining Position in the Transvaal. Reviewing the mining position at the quarterly meeting of the Chamber of Mines, Sir E. A. Wallers said that in the last three months the industry had settled down to hard efficient work. With the elimination of the shop stewards and mine committees and the restriction of trade union functions within reasonable limits, the managers had been able to devote to the efficient working of their mines much time which had previously been wasted in interminable discussions on frivolous, labour disputes. The scale of operation in the gold mines was now approximately the same as before the strike. [Johannesburg, :26th September.]
