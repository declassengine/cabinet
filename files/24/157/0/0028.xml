GREAT BRITAIN.The Unemployment Situation. The following paragraph is taken from the special report on unemployment, for the week ending 14th April, issued by the Ministry of Labour: The chief factor in the industrial situation continues to be the dispute in the engineering and shipbuilding industries ; otherwise there are some signs of increased activity, and a slightly more hopeful tone prevails in many districts. In coal-mining, however, the position generally is not so good, and in iron and steel there is a slight backward tendency. Future prospects in the engineering and shipbuilding industries are, of course, dependent upon the dispute, but the amount of repair work available continues to be rather larger than was anticipated. The effects of the dispute have been felt most in the East Midlands and north of England ; in other areas the effect has been far less general than was anticipated. The improvement in the motor section of the engineering trade continues. In the textile industries cotton continues to improve by slow degrees, and the position in the wool trade is still improving. There has been some temporary employment in Dundee which has suspended discharges in the jute trade. Hosiery continues to improve, but progress in the lace industry is very slow. The position in the boot and shoe trade is fairly good. There has been, a marked stimulus in the clothing, making-up and needle trades generally, and also in building and decorating, though this is mainly due to seasonal activity. Discharges still continue in Government establishments, particularly in the south of England, but, generally speaking, there are slight indications of improvement in a large number of industries, together with hopeful revivals though on a very small scale at present in a large number of firms which, when working full time, absorb a good proportion of local labour. The demand for building materials remains small, but there are signs of improvement in the furniture trade. Slackness is reported in the leather and. tanning industries.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.&apos;    IRAQ.The Naqib and the Treaty.-On 27th March, General Halclane, commanding the British, forces in Iraq, sent to Mr. Churchill the following note of a conversation he had with the Naqib : The Naqib gave bis views on. the subject of: the treaty. He said that a treaty between Great Britain and Iraq was unlike one negotiated, for instance, between Great Britain and France. In the latter case either party must keep a strict watch on its own interests which either was in. a position to uphold against the other, but in the former case Great Britain was concluding a treaty With a Government which she herself had created in accordance with the lines of her own policy. On the one hand, it was obvious that Iraq, could not exist for a moment without British support, while, on the other, if Britain wished to back her own policy and bring it to success, it was obvious that it was in her interest to give Iraq all the face value she could. In order to set Iraq before the world as an. independent Government, in close friendship with. Great Britain, the latter should in her treaty with the daughter country deal as leniently and generously as possible, since the treaty would be the public definition of her status.The Naqib next referred to his relations with the lnoslem world in. India. Indian Islam, he said, did not believe that the declared British policy towards Iraq, was sincere. If the formulae of the treaty did. not show beyond, a doubt that Britain was really desirous of establishing an independent islamic State here, he, as a well-known supporter of the British, would suffer, and British credit with islamic India would suffer no less. Great Britain, through the treaty which was now being-negotiated, might greatly improve her position in India, and she could have nothing to fear since Iraq was entirely dependent on her. With this in view he strongly opposed the mandate. But British authority in Iraq, which was and must long-remain a very real factor-, owing to the conditions which prevailed in the country, Should be exercised in a considerate manner, so that in the eyes of the world, the
credit, of Iraq should not suffer. To attain her end Britain would find: that the feelings of. friendship she inspired, were of greater value to her than, the force&apos; which she could undoubtedly rise if she chose to what end? It wasundeniable that she could get all she wanted, and get it more permanently, without force.The Naqib concluded his remarks by referring to&apos; the recent Egyptian settle-ment and said that it encouraged Iraqis&apos; to hope that Great Britain would deal generously with their country.RHODESIA.The Future of Rhodesia, See under &quot;Dominions (South Africa).&quot;INDIA.The Viceroifs&apos; Fortnightly. Report. The following telegram was sent on 11th April: -Bombay. There has been a lull in political agitation during the fortnight. The proceedings in the Assembly, culminating in the Viceroy&apos;s assent to the finance bill, and the proposed terms of peace/with Turkey, confirmed the position and prestige of the moderate party. The favourable issue to the negotiations regarding the Turkish settlement would probably result in the complete detachment of the caliphate party from the non-co-operation movement, save in the case of the irreconcilables:Section 2. The congress aud the central caliphate committee have both decided to abide by Gandhis last injunction, and-to confine activities to the constructive&apos; programme till dune, when they hope sufficient advance will have been made for a special joint session to decide and indicate the steps forward.Section 3. Bengal. The general lull in political activity continued throughout Bengal during.the second half of March.Section 4. The meeting, of the provincial congress and caliphate committee held at Bogra, at which the Bardoli resolution, as amended by the Delhi conference, was accepted after considerable discussion.Section 5. Evidently a strong body of opinion in the province is by no means satisfied with the non-violence campaign, and in some districts, especially in Earidpur, where the movement is largely controlled by members of the old revolutionary party, there are signs of a possible break-away. The only result of the conference has been renewed activity in picketing and collecting funds. There have been no incidents of any serious importance during the fortnight. The inhabitants of the disturbed area in the Tipperah district are still recalcitrant, but there has been no further collision with the police. The general situation has certainly improved, and the congress committees are outwardly advocating a peaceful constructive programme. There- are indications; however, that the trouble is by no means over. There have been cases of burning foreign cloth in Calcutta, and some recent speeches have been very seditious. There are two directions in which danger maybe apprehended: (1) a break-away of mohamedans; (2) a diversion of the movement&apos; into underground channels, or the combination of these two clangers in a revived wahabi movement.United Provinces. There is a genuine (sic, ? general) lull at present, and little to report. The position, however, is one of unstable equilibrium. If the agitation is renewed after the crops are cut, Agra may blaze out in the hot weather. There is no improvement in anti-British (corrupt group) or respect for authority, and lawless-ness is still manifest. It is confirmed now that Gand.hi&apos;s arrest evoked no excitement. It appears clear that Ganclhiism in various aspects is definitely on the wane, and the news of his arrest was received with a definite feeling of relief in some quarters. Hindu-moslem unity, never more than superficial, is failing to stand the test of practical experience. The mohamedans are awaiting the decisions of the Near-East conference. The effect of the cavalry march through the &quot; Eka&quot; country has been good.Punjab. Gandhi&apos;s trial and conviction appear to have accentuated the lull in the activities of the congress and caliphate work; the branch of the non-co-operation 39-4 A 2
movement is at present at a discord, the volunteer demonstrations have almost ceased,, and temperance and swadeshi movement has lost much activity. The demand for imported goods.has revived. Agitators, however, are still active in rural areas, and a large number of political meetings are held weekly. The effect of the location of punitive police posts in various villages is excellent. The latest report in regard, to the. operations against the akalis shows that in the same districts in. which&apos;action has been taken a large number of akalis have been arrested. Excluding persons subsequently released, the arrests total 730. The kirpan factories have been raided, and the results are reported to have been very satisfactory : long kirpans and black pagrjs are much less in evidence, ft has nowhere been found necessary to utilize the military for the purpose of arrest, and the general effect of the operations has been distinctly good, both on the akalis and on. other agitators. The troops, indeed, have been withdrawn from, three districts, and probably will be withdrawn from other-districts by 10th April. All additional police, however, will remain, as it is possible the jathas are only waiting for the police to be withdrawn before resuming seditious, activities. At the same time the vigorous action taken by the Government has impeded, if not altogether terminated, the reconciliation between the Government and the parbandak committee.Section. G. On 30th March the executive committee of the Shi.roma.ni gurclwara parbandak committee decided to break off, for the time being, negotiations over the gurdwara bill, and to inaugurate a vigorous agitation against the repressive policy of the Government.Section 7. The moderates have succumbed to the prevailing excitement, and the committee is uow dominated by the extremists. Swiftness and simultaneity of operations have embarrassed the committee, and it is at a loss how to encounter the-vigorous measures now being enforced.Bihar and Orissa. No fresh developments. GandhPs conviction is reported from some districts to have been received with relief. The constructive portion of the Bardoli programme creates little enthusiasm. In the Santal pargannas uneasiness continues, and in Rajmahal the non-co-operators collected bands of volunteers, invaded the Damin bazaars, took complete control, allowed no business to be trans-acted, and -were actually building a house to form their own headquarters. The-subdivisional officer, with police, quickly restored the situation. In Cuttack a troublesome situation has suddenly arisen. No serious developments are expected, and the prosecution of four of the non-co-operationist leaders, which has been sanctioned, should stop further manifestations.Assam. The reports from all districts arc on the -whole satisfactory. External agitation has almost ceased. The land -revenue comes in well. The courts are freely resorted to, and there is no open interference with trade. An undercurrent of&quot; sedition, however, continues. Gyclostyled copies of newspapers dealing with non-co-operation have been circulated in Sibsagar, and in some districts government servants have received threatening anonymous letters. In some quarters zamindars experience difficulty in the collection of rents. There has been trouble.in two tea gardens in Sylhet. Tbe commissioner of the Assam valley thinks that there is an undoubted possibility of further trouble, though doubtful whether the villages, as a whole, will support a new gospel; and the commissioner of the Surma valley writes that the change seems too sudden, and the utter absence of demonstration over Gandhi&apos;s arrest almost uncanny. In any case the commissioner suggests indications pointing to the abandonment of open agitation for the secret terrorism, adopted in Bengal 16 years ago. It is doubtful, however, -whether Assam will prove a congenial soil for crime of this nature.North-West Frontier Province. The hooliganism which marred His Royal Higim.ess&apos;s visit to Peshawar has continued in. evidence. Twelve of the leading-agitators were arrested ; but, in view of danger to which government servants are-subjected within city walls, the post and telegraph offices were closed, and these services conducted from offices outside the city. Orders regulating wheeled traffic were issued in order to allow patrolling. The high price of food grains is one of the causes of unrest. Elsewhere the fortnight has been without incident, and the political situation sabsfactory.Delhi. There has been almost an entire absence of political activity. There was a half-hearted hartal on 30th March, hi memory of the 1916 &quot;martyrs&quot;; traffic was not impeded and as many shopkeepers objected, to the demonstration as took- part in it.   Congress nominees are reported to have captured all 1.2 mohameclan seats:
--and half of the hindn. seats. The parties of the municipal committees will now be fairly evenly divided. Stout opposition to the congress caucus was put up in several wards.   Piece-goods business shows a welcome revival.Central Provinces. Gandhi&apos;s conviction caused no excitement; indeed, it was received almost with indifference. This lack of interest was due to the fact that Gandhi&apos;s influence had already largely waned, and the maharashtra leaders were casting about for a new leader and programme. It is reported that they intend to take instructions from C. P. Das on his release from jail; he is said to be ready to lead a new movement. The Nagpur congress committee have appointed a small committee to consider the future line of action. The campaign for the enrolment of congress members largely failed ; the picketing of liquor shops was half-hearted. Many cloth merchants are now insisting on ordering foreign cloth. Several &quot; national&quot; schools have been closed for want of funds. The greater part of the province is -quieter than, it has been for some time, but bad spirit is still abroad in Chattisgarh.General.  There is a general improvement in the political situation in all quarters. Vigorous action in the Punjab has been attended with satisfactory results. The non-co-operation leaders are somewhat nonplussed for the moment, and Malaviya has been taking the field with the object of establishing an agitation without tire.more objectionable features of non-co-operation and formulating a programme which will rally all parties. His . efforts seem to have been coldly received by the non-co-operators. Attempts being made to push the national week, but apparently little enthusiasm has been evinced, so far. The 13th was to have been date for the All-India hartal, but the 18th has now been substituted. The publication of the telegram of the Government of India to the India Office, regarding the Turkish peace terms, has had a marked effect on Indian moslems, and has increased the tendency -amongst mohamedans to detach themselves from . the non-co-operation party. We fear, however, that the- recent proposals regarding Thrace arid Acbianople may again revive bitter feeling.THE DOMINIONS.AUSTRALIA.Meat [B.E.R., lxvii, p. 6]. On 12th April the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed the following message to the Governor-General for transmission to his Prime Minister in reply to the lattefs message of 29th March : I learnt with much concern of the grave difficulties with which the Australian beef industry is now confronted. I could not, I fear, have held out any prospect of our being able to assist with a subsidy, and I am very glad, indeed to know that you. have been able with the co-operation of all interests concerned in Australia to make arrangements for relieving the situation. A further telegram will be sent later with regard to giving, effect to the recommendations of the Bridgeman committee.Signature of League of Nations Protocols [B.E.R., LXVI, p. 9]. On 16th April the Governor-General reported, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that his Ministers-concured in the ratification of the protocols except in relation to article 16, and requested a prior signature on behalf of the Commonwealth by the British repre-sentative on the Council.NEW ZEALAND.Position of British Indians in the Empire [B.E.R., lxvii, p. 6]. On 22nd April the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as-follows : My Government will be very glad to receive the Right Hon. S. Sastri as its guest, and. will give him every assistance and facility whilst here in carrying out his mission and in making the sojourn, of himself and his party in the Dominion as pleasant as possible. Mr. James Hislop, Undersecretary for the Department of Internal Affairs, Wellington, will be the officer concerned with the detailed arrauge-ments of the visit and Mr. Bajpai may get into personal communication with him.
SOUTH AFRICA.The Future of Rhodesia. [B.E.R., lii, p. 10]. The following telegram was sent by the High Commissioner for South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 21st April :-I am sending by to-day&apos;s mail a minute from the Union Ministers, stating for your information that meetings with the Rhodesian delegation began on 3rd. April and terminated on 18th April, and that highly satisfactory interviews have resulted. Full and frank discussions took place, and the whole question of the entry of Rhodesia, into the Union was examined. The delegates were told that the Union of South Africa will endeavour now to make a provisional agreement with the directors of the British South Africa Company with a view to acquiring the company&apos;s assets, particularly the land and railways, and if possible the mineral rights as well, and that as soon as this provisional agreement has been arrived at the Union of South Africa would be in a position to submit to the people of Rhodesia the terms which they would be willing to ask the Union Parliament to sanction. My Ministers informed the delegates that the Union of South Africa would be only able to put forward the terms on wdiich the people of Rhodesia could vote if the agreement could be arrived at within a reasonable time Avith the directors of the British South Africa Company, and that failing such agreement, or if such agreement were not likely to be achieved in the near future, it would not be possible for the question of incorporation of Rhodesia in the Union to be submitted to the people at a referendum on responsible government draft letters patent. My Ministers are now engaged in a detailed discussion with the directors. To the minute is attached an official memorandum summarising the conference proceedings which have been already published through Reuter. My Ministers add that no further statement will be published until the discussions with the directors are concluded.
