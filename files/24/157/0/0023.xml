GREAT BRITAIN.The Industrial situation.ion.-&apos;Th.e following paragraph is taken from the report on unemployment for the week ending 3rd February, issued by the Ministry of Labour: There is no change in the general industrial situation. Some improvement in coal-mining is reported from Lancashire and Scotland. The iron and steel industry shows no real signs of revival. Shipbuilding and marine engineering are at a very low ebb. The gradual improvement in the woollen industry has been maintained. Cotton is still very depressed. There is no improvement in the lace-making industry. General -engineering is still very depressed, but the slight improvement recorded in the motor and cycle section has been maintained. There has been a check to the activity in the tinplate industry. Building remains stagnant. Slight local improvements are recorded in linoleum manufacture, chemical manufacture and tanning.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.ADEN.Raids on the Protectorate. The following telegram from the Resident at Aden was received by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 4th February: I received information on 24th January of raids on the Haushabi tribe at Ad Dareja, about 40 miles north-west of Lahej within the Protectorate border. This was the latest of several attacks made recently on British protected tribes under various pretexts. The raiders were Imam men, but orders had recently been issued by the Imam to his commanders that such encroachments were to cease. It is agreed by the ImanPs envoy here that these raiders were acting without his orders. I assisted Haushabi with arms and ammunition, but these tribesmen are poor fighters under a nervous ruler.Continued reports of our tribes&apos; losses in life and property impelled me to decide that the bombing of Sara war, where (group omitted) was reported to have made his quarters within the border, was justified. The Royal Air Force effected this operation on the afternoon of 1st February, and they were heavily fired on near Dareja soon afterwards. The Royal Air Force returned the fire, and dispersed the gathering which threatened Dareja. On the morning of 2nd February, aeroplanes reconnoitring were again fired on, and a party of enemy was successfully bombed. Later the supposed main body of raiders was discovered by Royal Air Force retiring and burning Haushabi villages on the way.   They were completely routed.The casualties in the Air Force were nil, whilst the enemy&apos;s total casualties numbered about 35 killed. The work of the Royal Air Force under Flight-Lieutenant MacLaren was thorough and effectual.   I anticipate good results from action taken.KENYA COLONY.The Indian Question [B.E.R., lv., p. 2]. On 1st February the Viceroy of India telegraphed to the Secretary of State as follows : A ReuteFs telegram from London, dated 27th January, received at Bombay on 30th January, reports that Mr. Churchill, at the East African dinner, announced the final decision that the highlands of Kenya will be exclusively reserved for Europeans ; that the future immigration of Indians into East Africa will be strictly regulated ; and that Indians who conform to a well-marked European standard, regarding which the European community will be fully consulted, will not be denied the fullest civic and political rights. The occasion of this announcement appears to us unfortunate, and the substance of it is bound to provoke extreme bitterness in this country, and to add to our difficulties at a very critical juncture. It is most regrettable that the announce-ment has apparently reached India in an incomplete form.   Nothing is reported
regarding segregation, or the precise qualifications for the franchise. We are greatly -embarrassed, both by the lack of official information as to the exact terms of the -announcement, anchbythe knowledge that we recently officially advised the Indians in-East Africa to refrain from passive resistance, and to accept the interim offer of the nomination of Indian members to the Executive and Legislative Council, in the con-fidence that a fair settlement would be reached. The political effect of the announcement in this country is likely to be so serious that we beg you to consider, even at this fate -stage, whether you cannot do anything further to help us.2. In the meantime, in order to put the Government of India right with the country, it, may be necessary for us to publish the correspondence that lias passed between us on the subject. But before doing so we shall inform you what&apos;papers we-propose to publish and ask for your approval.3. We should be glad if you would send us a telegram which we may publish,, stating the exact terms of the decision, with such explanations as may be necessary.&apos; Please telegraph also, for our own information, a summary of what Mr. Churchill actually -said. We may add that Mr. Churchills reference to the creation of a great East African federation, taken with his reference to the future of East Africa as a characteristic and distinctively British colony looking forward to self-government, will add to the -apprehensions which will be aroused by the rest of his speech. We should like to know whether this has been definitely accepted as the goal of colonial policy in East Africa.INDIA.The Viceroy&apos;s Fortnightly Report. -The following telegram was sent from Delhi -on 11th February : - -Bombay. The situation still continues to be fluid. A public meeting was held oh the .29th, Gandhi being present, at which a resolution of non-payment of taxes and prepared-ness to face the consequences was passed.   The decision was considered by the congress working committee, which is reported to have congratulated the Bardoli conference! The working committee is to meet at Bardoli on 11th, and, in view of GandbTs latest pronouncement, it seems&apos; certain that civil disobedience will be attended (sic) there.    The situation in Anancl Taluka, the second Taluka selected by Gandhi for civil disobedience, is good, and the land revenue is coming in satisfactorily.   The response to the appeal for volunteers continues languid in mahornmedan circles. The intensity &quot;of feeling in regard to Turkish questions-continues, exacerbated by., the facilities which the British Government is reported to be giving the Greeks for &apos; floating a loan in Britain.   A resolution was passed by the working committee of the central caliphate committee, pointing out how frequently the.Government have been warned that any help given to Greece would be taken by the mahommedans.. of India as a breach of neutrality, that Government do not care about their threats, and that, if mussalmans repudiate loyalty to the Government, the sole responsibility would&apos;: rest on the Government.   It was decided to send the resolution, to Gandhi and. to-inform him that the loyalty of moslems would cease from the day the loannwas--floated in England, and, if their ulemas.so advised, they would abandon the -non-violent, movement.   It is rumoured that the British Government intend taking pyer the control of, or purchasing the Hedjaz railway.   A communique on this subject was recently issued by. us.Madras. Except for events separately reported, there, is little to report&apos; from Madras, though in several districts meetings and speeches were prohibited under section .144, and action taken under sections 107 and 108. A few cases of disobedience of orders were followed by prosecution under section 188.Section 2, dated 12th February. There is little doubt that the events on the-day of ihe Prince of - Wales&apos; visit to Madras have done a good deal to discredit non-co-operation in Madras. &apos;Section 3. A communique issued yesterday states that reports from Guntur indicate that the energetic measures adopted by district officers are having effect; some ryots in the affected area are returning to a more sensible frame of mind, and beginning to pay overdue instalments of the land tax.   Many village officers, who had
resigned, are asking to be allowed to withdraw their resignations. The collection of revenue is still a matter of difficulty, and the staff are subjected to threats, but the-work is progressing. The volunteers, who disobeyed orders prohibiting interference-with the excise auctions, have been prosecuted and fined.&apos; Section 4. Bengal. Although there is less picketing, and speeches are less-objectionable in tone, the general situation has not improved during the fortnight.. There has been no systematic inauguration of civil disobedience in any definite area, but parts of the province are drifting towards it. The movement is taking two forms, both in Calcutta and in the Mofussil: (a) holding meetings in defiance of the orders prohibiting them; (b) interference with the police in discharge of their duties. In Calcutta picketing is practically suspended, largely due to the difficulty of obtaining: :recruits for this work. Non-co-operationist leaders have concentrated on organizing meetings for the sole purpose of defying the orders issued by the Commissioner of Police under&quot;the Police Act. In this, they have exploited the assistance of Bengali ladies, whose presence has increased, the Governments difficulties, as they are unwilling to proceed against such persons, save in the last resort.Section 5. In a number of cases meetings have had to be dispersed and disturbances, with stoning of police, have occurred in the Mofussil. At Dacca,. Tippera, Noakhali, Sirajganj, Titagarh, meetings have had to be dispersed by force, and in some cases, separately reported, firing has been ordered.Section G. The campaign against the chowkidars and the payment of chowkidari tax is the serious feature of the situation in the Mofussil. The regular police have, on the whole, withstood very well the persistent attempts to seduce them from loyalty to the Government, but three districts report that the greater part of their force cannot be relied on in an emergency. Generally, the continuance of the pressure by Government has had a good effect which may, to some extent, be weakened by the vote of the Legislative Council in favour of the withdrawal of all repressive nieasures and release of all those convicted. The starting of mass civil disobedience in any other part of India would almost certainly be the signal for imitation in local areas, as the abstention from paying taxes or rent is the popular promised result of swaraj. The movement in Bengal is now so decentralized that the local congress councils are the&apos;&apos;only ones that count in their own area, and even their influence is uncertain in the direction of restraint. The main problem is to restore the authority of the police and the Government officers. Additional police will almost certainly be required, and the prospect of conflicts with the masses cannot be overlooked.Section 7. United Provinces.-With local exceptions, the fortnight has been reasonably quiet; subsequent outbreaks at Chain! Chaura and Bareilly have been separately reported., , Section 8. A section of non-co-operators is nervous of the projected campaign of civil disobedience, and, where the movement is under control, there would probably be hesitation and waiting on events elsewhere. In many places the movement, however, is out of central control. The lower strata in many cities and towns are under little discipline, and the mahommedans in particular are sullen. Volunteer-demonstrations have been common. Most of them are technically peaceful, but in Meerut, Dehra Dun and elsewhere have been sufficiently disorderly to demand dispersal by force.Section 9. The local government accepted an amendment in local council (1) to withdraw the Criminal Law Amendment Act from those districts where, in the opinion of the Government, life aud property and public tranquillity are no longer endangered; (2) to examine cases of persons convicted, with a view to release, if -possible, or to reduction of sentence; (3) to issue instructions to Commissioners -and District Ufficers to apply the Act with restraint and discretion.&apos; It has since been announced that, in view of recent events, the Government cannot agree to with-clrawal at present; the question will be considered when the general situation has [improved. Ah political cases, since the Criminal Law Amendment Act was imposed, are to be examined by an additional Judicial. Commissioner. Apart from this special -scrutiny, His Excellency in Council already reduced or modified 75 sentences. Hostile feeling is strong in the towns.. Section 10. The rural areas, on the whole, are comparatively unaffected. Instances -are reported of the friendliness with which district officers are received in the villages, and of assistance rendered by local raises against occasional hostile demonstrations of
the local rabble. But in the towns, the great mass, of people is against all authority, .and once civil disobedience is ordered, the spark may anywhere start a blaze. The local government is, as far as possible, prepared in advance for the various forms new developments may take.Section 1.1.   The outrage at Ohauri Chaura has frightened the public a greatdeal.Section 12. Punjab. There has been much political activity during the fortnight. A^olunteers are being enrolled in almost every district, and a number of: demonstrations have occurred, particularly in Amritsar, Lahore, Rohtak,&apos; Hissaf, Ludhiana, Earnal, Jullundur, Hosniapur and Ferozepore. The principal activity is. interference with the auctions of excise licences and liquor shops. In this connexion there were disorderly scenes at Rohtak, Amritsar, Dharmkot in Ferozepore and -Jullundur. Two hundred and fifty political meetings were reported during the fortnight, but there were no instances of active civil disobedience beyond the refusal, of three lainbardars in Ludhiana to pay land revenue. The continued violent Speaking, however, is bringing about a marked increase in anti-Government feeling and activity.Part 2, dated 12th February :-Efforts to win over Government servants, particularly the police, have been -steadily maintained ; the results so far are inconsiderable. In some districts the Sikh situation appears to have improved, but the Commissioner, Jullundur, reports that Governments action in returning keys and releasing Sikh prisoners is regarded as an unqualified triumph for the non-co-operation movement and the Sikh extremists, and that the Sikhs are now talking without reserve of the next movement being to secure the keys of the Punjab. The Commissioner, Lahore, considers the situation is taking , .a turn for the worse, but the Government questions the correctness of this estimate. The number of Akalis is increasing, and the temper of ordinary members is anti-Government.Section 13. The Gurdwara committee has issued a communique to the effect that pandit Dina Natli had not been released, that no measure for Gurdwara reform acceptable to the Sikh community has been presented, and no circular for freeing the Kirpan had been issued - by the Government; that, therefore, the religious situation is as grave as ever; that the committee cannot withhold the natural expression of religious discontent, and that instructions as to future action will be&apos; issued shortly.Section Pi. An aggravated form of unrest amongst the Sikhs would add materially to the dangers of the situation, and we have asked the Punjab Government for a further appreciation of the Sikh situation.Section 15.   Central Provinces. The chief event has been the highly successful visit of Ills Royal Highness to Nagpur.   The success and general atmosphere of cordiality which prevailed should help to remove some of the bitterness caused by: recent events.   The first attempt at civil disobedience occurred in Raipur, where the residents of four villages removed wood from Government forests without licences.Section 16.   Elsewhere there are no indications of any immediate action in this-direction.   Enrolment of volunteers continues, but the response is not enthusiastic. There has been some increase in picketing liquor shops, but picketing cloth shops-has not yet been seriously attempted.Assam. The political&apos; situation is much as last fortnight in the Assam Valley.&quot;The principal features are abstentions from hats, withholding supplies from Govern-in ent servants, garden coolies and Europeans, or the grant of supplies only on receipt of exorbitant prices, and withholding of taxes. A proposal has been sub-mitted to the Government of India for the regulation of penalizing the refusal to sell supplies, after an order by the Deputy Commissioner to legalize requisition when necessary. The collection of land revenue is very backward in the Surma Valley. . There has been an increase in the number of meetings and the activity- of volunteers, and insulting Europeans and Government servants is more common. Arrangements are being made for a inarch of the Assam Rifles through the Sibsagar District- as a military demonstration for the special benefit of the garden coolies in the Assam Valley.   The Commissioner considers the forces of law and order are..,gaining ground in two districts.   In the Surma Valley the situation tends to grow
worse, aud a greater show of authority will be necessary. There are possibilities of riots; either in connexion with the coercive measures for the realization of revenue,, of in consequence of the contamination of the garden labour force. The Local Government cannot guarantee to prevent isolated riots, but they have ample force to stop widespread rioting definitely and effectively.vSection 17. Application has been made aud sanctioned for the extension of the Seditious Meetings Act to Nowgong and Cachar.Section 18. Delhi. There have been no overt acts of non-co-operation or civil clisobedience, and the volunteers have been kept in the background. Also no arrests tinder the special Acts. There has been considerable activity over collecting money for&apos; the Angora Fund among mahommedans. It is suspected that collecting for this fund is beitig used partially as a cloak for enrolling of volunteers. There has been a great output of offensive booklets, tending to exasperate racial hatred, at a nominal price.- The chief immediate object of the non-co-operators is to ensure a hartal on 14th February on the arrival of His Royal Highness. Enthusiastic preparations, have been made by the zamiudars of Delhi and the neighbouring districts to come in&apos; to- see His Royal Highness and the various functionaries. A gathering of Chamars to protest against swaraj, aud the oppression it will entail on the lower castes, has been spontaneously organized.   Trices are easier.i&apos; Section 19. North-West Frontier Province.-Political activity is little in evidence, although attempts have been made by non-co-operators in Peshawar and Dehra Ismail Khan to interfere with the sale of excise licences; the attempt failed in Peshawar, the prices realized being in excess of expectation. A successful -district -darbar was held by the Chief Commissioner at Peshawar. Prices are continuing to fall...&apos; General. Our general appreciation of the situation at the moment was conveyed, in&apos;our telegram reviewing events since the inception of the inauguration movement.t..v &quot; .THE DOMINIONS.Advisory Committee on Civil Aviation [B.E.R., lxi, p. 6, aud Ixii, p. 5]. The Governor-General of New Zealand telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 7th February that his Government did not desire to appoint a permanent representative to the Civil Aviation Advisory Board, but suggested that the High. -Commissioner for New Zealand should be consulted when the occasion arose.CANADA.Women and Children Convention [B.E.R., Ixii, p. 5]. On 6th February the Governor-General reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies a minute of the Council, dated 2nd February, intimating the desire of Canada that the convention for the suppression of traffic, in women and children should be ratified on behalf of Canada.AUSTRALIA.Loan to Austria and lite Meal Trade. The following telegram from the Prime-Minister to Mr. Lloyd George, transmitted by the Governor-General, was received by &quot;hie Secretary of State for the Colonies on 5th February : It is reported that the British Government is lending Austria two and a half million pounds. The Australian meat trade is most seriously depressed by Ihe stock of old meat, aud Austria wants meat very badly. I urge you most strongly to -consider favourably the suggestion that a part of this Austrian loan should take the form of meat drawn from the old stock. So far from prejudicing British interests pr consumers, this will benefit them and help Australia very materially.
Miscellaneous. The following items of information were issued from the Office of the High Commissioner in London : Imports and Exports (dated 3rd February). The values of the goods imported to, and exported from Australia, during the months of November and December 1921,. were as follows : Imports. Exports.November.    &apos;7,650,363              Australian Produce - -        -    10,312,183Other Produce        - -  -        &quot;-        316,986Total -        -  10,629,169December.   8,809,579 Australian Produce - -        -    11,673,692Other Produce        - -        -        330,701Total -        -        -   12,004,393Australian Fruit Fool. The Commonwealth Government has established a pool for the marketing of Australian canned fruit. This announcement follows the action of the Government in issuing stringent regulations for the grading and packing of all Australian fruit for export. The pool will be administered by an advisory committee, which will include a canning expert and a representative of the fruit-growers. Co-operative companies have been appointed in each State as agents for; the pool for the collection of, and payment for, the fruit. There will be a sub-pool for each variety of fruit, and the profits will be distributed among contributing growers proportionately, subject to the deduction of any losses from other sub-pools. All fruit will be inspected by expert officers appointed by the pool, and will only be accepted if satisfactory, at the following prices per pound to growers, less the freight on any fruit not accepted :--Peaches for canning, clingstone Id., slipstone Id.; pears for canning, 1-Jd. ; apricots for canning, l-\d. ; for pulping, id.; plums for canning or pulping, \d. ; gooseberries for canning lf-d., for pulping Id. ; and pineapples for canning, 3s. per case.It is expected that 40 per cent, of the total pack will be available for export, and that samples of the new canned fruit will be available in London early in March, and a bulk shipment shortly afterwards.SOUTH AFRICA. The following telegrams were sent by ReuteFs agents :: The Strike. Interviewed by the Cape Times, Sir Abe -Bailey declared that the English leaders of the miners, 75 per cent, of whom were Nationalists, had allowed themselves to be made the dupes of the Nationalist party. Neither the leaders nor the strikers, he declared, thought a stake would begin, as a result of a ballot, before further negotiations were entered into, but the Nationalists had insisted on a strike taking place immediately. The English leaders had been under the control of Mr. Tielman Boos, the Nationalist member of the Legislative Assembly, who had carried the whole issue into the realm of politics while pretending to the strikers that their cause was being fought. General Smuts and the Union Government knew what was going on, but kept quiet, and demoralized the strategy of the Nationalists, and the thanks of South Africa were due to General Smuts for the way in which he had. handled the strike. Sir Abe Bailey further declared that the coal strike was over to all intents and purposes. The gold strike was&apos; crumbling, and he urged that when it was over the mine owners should be content to see the men go back to work and should leave it to Parliament to frame a permanent, settlement.Parliament should see, continued Sir Abe Bailey, that the future of South Africa as a &quot; white &quot; country must be looked to as well as the interests of the Rand, and that any settlement must be on a permanent basis so that those j)roviding the capital could look a long way ahead in order to develop new mines.
Sir Alie Bailey finally emphasized that the Chamber must see to it that the men were not left disgruntled and dissatisfied, while the men on their side must recognize that the industry was up against hard economic facts. He, therefore, urged that both the Government and the Chamber must see that work was provided for the unemployed.   (Capetown, 3rd February.)Situation on the Rand. In an interview with ReuteFs correspondent here to-day, Mr. Boydell, Leader of the Labour Party, referring to the serious situation on the Rand and to Mr. Waterston&apos;s resolution demanding a republic, said he would be false to his election pledges and convictions if he supported any move to subvert the present Constitution. He emphasized that the Labour Party was pledged to the maintenance of the present Constitution and he thought a Nationalist republic would in any case be a social and economic disaster apart from anything else. He declared that South Africa seemed once more to be on the brink of a cataclysm, the usual cause or driving force being dictation by moneyed power through the medium of the Corner House. Mr. Boydell accused the Government of complicity and of openly flouting Parliament, the constitutional safety valve, &quot; thereby driving desperate men to desperate statements and probably to desperate deeds.&quot;   (Capetown, 6th February.)Revolutionary Movement. In the course of a statement to-day, Mr. A. G. Barlow, Labour Member of the House of Assembly for Bloemfontein (North), said he believed the strike had been forced on the workers by financial interests, and that everything that could be done should be done to assist the workers to win, but in a proper -constitutional manner. He strenuously opposed aud severely condemned any attempt, no matter by wdrat political parties or persons, to overthrow constitutional authority, and called on all the workers of the Free State Province to support constitutional authority in any efforts to put down revolution.   (Capetown, 6th February.)
