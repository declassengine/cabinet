COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.The 8ituation.-Oh 27tlx December 1921 Lord Allenby reported [No. 694] that the situation in the country had improved during the previous 24 hours.. Work had been resumed in practically all Government offices on the normal basis. The Cairo schools were still on strike and had been closed, by advice.No serious incidents had been reported from the, large towns, though in Cairo, Damanhur and Minia there had been small, demonstrations which had been, dealt with without difficulty.   The situation at Port Said had considerably improved.Telegraphing [No. 099] again on the following day he further reported that the situation throughout the country again showed improvement. No serious disorder had been reported except from Fua town, about .I.u miles south of Rosetta, where a mob had opposed by force an attempt by the local police authorities to arrest a man implicated in the recent demonstrations.There were still no signs of unrest amongst the fellaheen. The reports from the provinces were reassuring, while the towns were returning to normal conditions, although subversive propaganda was still being preached by the students: ;. *0On the 3l.st December he yet further reported [No. 70S] that beyond two minor incidents of railway sabotage no incidents had occurred during the last 24 hours and that the situation remained calm., IRAQ... The Situation at. Roioandus-The following telegram [No. S20] was sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies by the High Commissioner of Iraq on 20th December:  Following ou the arrival of SO additional Turkish infantry at Rowauduz the Surclii, led by Obeidullah and supported by the Turks, have resumed the offensive: Trouble has also occurred in Naodesht.A force of (?one) squadron of levies and 35 police, which left Arb.il on 13th December to carry out a road reconnaissance, was heavily fired on in the.neighbour-hood of Babachichek (reference Maunsell sheet 33, latitude 36/ 2, longitude 44&apos; 6).The force fought objective (?) rearguard action as far as Dir. . . . where, firing ceased. The force reached Dera in safety and returned to Arbil. Our casualties were four rank and file killed and five wounded. Lieutenant Bois: was also wounded in the forearm.The enemy have been identified as Surchi under . . . Attaullah, sou of Obaidullah. Their strength is estimated at 300 rifles. It is reported there is a hostile concentration at Babachichek, and that Obaidullah and Raqib are at Batas, which place Obaidullah is urging the Turks to occupy.The following Turkish forces are reported to Rowanduz:--200 infantry, 1 gun and 8 machine guns.   A small Turkish force is also reported at Harir.Sadleir Jackson has gone to Aroil, and a punitive expedition by three columns of levies converging on Harir is being arranged for 27th December, combined with aerial action.On 18th December it was reported from Rania that four villages in the Naodesht area had formed an alliance to oppose the Government and had refused payment of taxes, and that the villages had been put in a state of defence. At present there is no information that this movement is being actively supported by outside elements. The enemy, strength in this area is estimated at 120 rifles. One company of levy infantry is being sent from Sulaimani to Derbeud to deal with the situation ; but heavy snow is (? likely) to make punitive operations by troops impossible. Aerial action is being considered, aud a demonstration over Babachichek and Naodesht will be carried out as soon as weather conditions permit. It is hoped that the despatch of infantry to Derbend will prevent the spread of the movement for the present.Situation at Shaqlawa   ...   is reported to be so far satisfactory.The general situation indicates that Turkish prestige amongst the Kurdish tribes has considerably increased at our expense.
INDIA.&apos;: The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., lix, p. 31.-Telegraphing [2837 S.] on. 19th. September the Viceroy transmitted a report from Chitral to the effect that the Afghans were evacuating Arnawai and were removing their baggage to Birkot&apos; It was expected that the evacuation Would be complete by the time this report was&apos; sent off.. On 16th December the A7iceroy reported that lie had sent a wireless message to the Afghan Foreign Minister iii protest against the violation of the frontier, which had taken, place on 11th December, when an armed lashkar from Khost, consisting, largely of Afghan subjects, had attacked, a British convoy between Datta Khel and Muhammed Khel. After severe fighting the lashkar had been beaten off and had retired to Khost, taking with them, however, a considerable amount of Government arms and equipment. Pending instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Viceroy had expressed, his assurance that the Afghan Government would institute immediate investigation and-take the necessary measures to punish those concerned in the raid, as well as to prevent any possible further violations of the frontier.In acknowledgment of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram, Lord Curzon telegraphed [6450] -on 21st December.a message for transmission to the Afghan Foreign Minister. In this, after referring to the disquiet which had been caused to His Majesty&apos;s Government by the serious raid from Khost into British territory, at the very time when they were awaiting information as to the steps taken by the Afghan Government to punish the persons implicated in the Shahjui raid, Lord Curzon pointed out that it was one of the first obligations of neighbouring and friendly nations to prevent such occurrences. He then expressed the confident hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Amir would take the measures necessary to that end, and demonstrate his intentions and power to enforce them by punishing the offenders. He invited, early information as to what measures may have been taken. Lord Curzon regretted that his first message after the conclusion of the recent agreement should relate to matters which that agreement had been designed to avoid. ;The Viceroy reported [2866 S.] on 22nd December that the above message had been telegraphed to&apos;Landi Kotal for onward transmission. At the same time he announced the receipt of a telegram from Kabul acknowledging, the receipt of his message of 16th December, and saying that &quot; pacifying arrangements &quot; had been taken. The actual reply to the message, and the feeling relating to these occurrences and other diplomatic questions; would await the arrival at their respective places of residence of the extraordinary envoys.: ,Exchange of Ministers [B.E.R., lix, p. &apos;3].-On 23rd December the Viceroy transmitted the5 following telegram from the Foreign Minister at Kabul to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs : &quot;His Excellency Lord Curzon&apos; of Keclleston, Foreign Minister, London. I have pleasure that I can now submit the name of-Aliqdr Sadaqat Moab Abdul Hadi Khan, my second counsellor in Foreign Ministry, as Afghan Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary in Royal Court of London for approval, and hereby solicit the daily increase of our friendly relations. His Excellency Sardar-i-Ala Mahnmcl Tarzi, Foreign Minister, Kabul.&quot;The Viceroy&apos;s Report. The following telegram was sent on 28th December1921:- &apos;Section 1. Madras.. There has been little development in the political situation .of. any interest. - Proceedings have been instituted under the security sections of the Criminal Procedure Code against several agitators, and orders have been issued under section 144, restraining others ; these orders have been generally obeyed. The action taken under Part II. of the Criminal Law Amendment Act has been applied to the whole presidency as a precautionary measure; it has had a good effect in most districts. At Guntur and Velio resolutions advocating civil disobedience were passed, but,.there have been no indications as yet of the actual refusal to&apos;pay taxes. No &apos; details have been/received about the Moplah raid on Pandalur.Section - 2.   Bombay. The necessary dispositions are being, made to meet any developments which may arise in Gujarat in connexion with the congress and
Moslem League session at Ahniedabad. There Las been a lull in the non-co-operation agitation, partly on account of the recent riots in Bombay city, and partly due to a sense of expectancy as to the developments in Ahniedabad, and the adoption of civil disobedience elsewhere in India. Gandhi has threatened mass civil disobedience in Gujarat. In moderate circles anxiety is expressed in regard to the alleged wholesale arrests and repressive measures. The extremist press, is endeavouring to stampede them into a coalition against the Government. It is becoming, daily,more imperative that a settlement of the Turkish question should be pushed&apos; on with all. possible despatch.Bengal. There has been little change in the political situation in Mo fuss il, but the leaders are closely watching developments in Calcutta. The action taken in Calcutta is having some restraining effect throughout the presidency, and. a decrease in activities is reported from several districts. The mining work in Asansol was not-disorganized by the Indian labour conference at Jheria. In a few districts there-&apos; are indications that much may be going on behind, the scenes; in one instance an ex-detenu assumed control after the arrests of the volunteer leaders, with the apparent intention of directing organization along secret channels. In Howrah a civil guard is being formed on the model of that in Calcutta, but the Bengali bliadrahxj have not joined in the movement. Special arrangements have been made to prevent an influx of mill hands from Howrah to Calcutta during the Prince&apos;s visit. The main struggle is being fought out in Calcutta, where developments have been rapid. Numerous arrests have been made, totalling, up to 15th December, 753 persons. The arrests have evoked protests from the moderate and from, the extremist press. Arrests are avoided wherever possible, and the Government examine cases and release wherever possible, especially students; but latterly the persons courting arrest have been mostly mill hands, and during the last few. days the hooligan element has been reappearing in the streets. On the 9th and 10th of December the situation was serious, and troops were called out to picket the turbulent area, In spite of counter-propaganda by the Government, the promotion of hartal on tlie Prmce&apos;s visit continues active, and at one time it seemed likely that hartal on the 24th would be complete.Section o. Our information, however, is that the Prince&apos;s reception on that date was highly successful and hartal was less complete than had been anticipated. Several prosecutions have been instituted for seditious speeches and press articles.Section 4. Bihar aud Orissa. At Cuttack a secret meeting was held to discuss the policy to be adopted by the non-co-operators in view of the proclamation of the-volunteer associations. No decision was arrived at,&apos;and this may be regarded as typical for the whole province. The leaders appear to be waiting to see, firstly, what the Government are going to do; and, secondly, what move will be made by the central organization. in Tirhut, all the local officers seem to be of opinion that the situation has changed for the better, though this view is not apparently shared by the planting community.Section 5. In Patna there has been a good, deal of political excitement; the acting Governor received on the 15th a deputation of members of the Legislative Council, who had sent a temperate protest against the introduction of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. The circumstances which had led the Government to adopt this measure wrere explained. The only suggestion the deputation could make was that the notification should be withdrawn at least temporarily, but the deputation were unable to give a guarantee that this would affect the proposed hartal on the 22nd in the city.Section G. . It was at one time feared that this would be (?complete), but, in the end very large crowds attended the Prince of Wales&apos; arrival, and his visit was a complete success. Generally speaking, the action against the volunteers has had some effect, except in Patna.Section 7. The local Government have now arranged that no further action shall be taken against the volunteers, save by the specific and direct order of the Government. On the 22nd they announced that they had decided to release all those recently,arrested or convicted under Act. XIV. of 1908, on condition that they gave an undertaking to refrain from picketing shops, promoting hartals, recruiting volunteers and fostering civil disobedience. This offer has not, however, been accepted. It was apparently made in the mistaken anticipation that, the deputation of the 21st to the Viceroy would result in a round-table conference.   -
Section 8. : United Provinces. The uon-co-operators selected a period imuier diately preceding the Prinee&apos;s visit to challenge the Government on the volunteer issue. The action taken by the local Government has everywhere been welcomed by the local authorities. The commissioner oi&apos; Fyzabad states that there has been great improvement in the moral of the police, and that those who have resigned are now applying to be taken back. The commissioner of Agra states that the present policy of the Government appears to be generally welcomed, and there are no signs at present ol&apos; any resentment. The commissioner of Gorakkpur states that the moderate parly not only welcome the arrests, but, in some cases, are jubilant over them. The commissioner of Meerut says that the action of the Government has been hailed by all loyal persons with the greatest relief, and that the much-harried police are now in much better heart. The commissioner of Lucknow, while expressing the view that the unrest among the mohamedans has considerably increased, says that the hindu population, especially the cultivating classes, seem to be settling down. Unofficial reports point, however, to a dis-qnieting state of unrest and discontent, particularly in the urban areas, but the manifesto signed by many leading citizens of Allahabad vigorously justifies the action taken by the Government. The police resignations now total 73. The resignations in other branches of the Government services have been few and unimportant.Section 9. It is too soon to form an opinion as to what lengths the movement for disobeying the newly-applied laws may be carried, but there are some signs of improvement in Lahore.Section 10. There have been complaints of rough treatment by the police of the crowds in Lahore and Amritsar, ami the local Government have announced that these, are being.inquired into, but have also warned people that the police have instructions to avoid making arrests as far as possible, but to disperse unlawful assemblies, using for that purpose the minimum of force necessary.Section II. In Amritsar the caliphate party is said to have had a split over the question of civil disobedience, and the maulvis will not take part in it. Every effort is being made to circulate, the&apos; subject matter of the proscribed fatwa. Only 19 resignations were reported during the fortnight for political or religious reasons, and some of these do not appear to be genuine cases. The excitement over the affair of the keys of the Amritsar Golden Temple is reported to be subsiding. As a body the Akalis have been quiet, but in some villages in the Lahore division the low-class elements amongst them have shown some truculence. The commissioner of Jullundur notes that the zamindars are beginning spontaneously to disapprove of violent, lectures, and to repel attacks upon the Government. On the other hand, troops had to be sent from Delhi on.25th December to an outlying tahsil of the Gurgaon district, where a party sent to arrest a caliphate leader had been reported to be besieged in the tahsil building by a mob of cultivators. We attach no special importance to this.Section 12. Central Provinces. The chief event has been the uaharashtra conference of the Central Provinces and the llerar Marathi-speaking districts. The most important resolution, carried by three to one at the general conference and by six districts against two at the provincial conference, was in favour.of obstructive co-operation to replace GandliFs original, programme of non-co-operation. The revolt against gandhis supremacy did not meet with universal approval, and. public meetings -were held in Nagpur and A kola to protest against any change in his programme. On the whole, there has been a lull in political agitation.Section. 1.3. Delhi.-The total number of arrests made is reported to be 123. The great majority were for contravention of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. -On the 13th December there was considerable excitement in the city, and military assistance was requisitioned. It did not, however, become necessary to bring troops into contact with the rabble. On the 1.6th, the congregation at the Fatehpuri mosque, reported to be 5,000 in number, wailed alter prayers to accompany 30 volunteers in uniform in their procession. Meanwhile, some 4,000 men from the -Jama-Masjid collected in front of the kotwali. The latter crowd was successfully dispersed by the police without any serious casualties. The Fatehpuri crowd consequently made no attempt at a hostile demonstration. The moral of the police is said to have improved. The low-class mohamedan element in the city, upon which the recent campaign of abuse of the Government has had most effect, are now36-1 B
thoroughly demoralized. The recruitment for the new additional police, recently sanctioned, has been very satisfactory.Section 14, Assam. Criminal proceedings have been taken against volunteers and prominent: leaders. It is too early to judge the effect of the measures now being-adopted,, but improvement in the situation lias been reported from some districts.Section 15. A generally disappointing and somewhat unexpected feature of the present situation is the. changed attitude of the -moderate press, it is not denied that action by the Government has had some justification, but the illegal activities of the volunteers are minimized, and complaint is made that the Government have been too drastic in applying emergency legislation, and that the situation can only be dealt with by constructive measures. There is a general demand on the part of the moderate press and politicians for a conference of all parties with the Government, but His Excell.ency&apos;s speech to the deputation of the 21st December at Calcutta has, so far as we can judge,&apos; been well received, and may bring about some modification of the moderate attitude.. There are clear indications that the extremists are anxious to induce, the moderates to return to the congress fold, but there is little sign - that, * the moderates are disposed to accept the invitation. On the other, hand, our information points to Gandhis determination to persist in his defiant attitude on the volunteer movement, probably in the hope of precipitating civil disobedience and of embarrassing the Government by compelling it to continue making arrests in increasing numbers. -Much depends on the attitude of the moderate party after the first excitement has subsided, and it may be hoped that His Excellency&apos;s grave warning in his Calcutta speech, on the 21st, regarding the probable effect on the British nation and Parliament of affronts to the Prince of Wales, will have a steadying effect. General attention is concentrated on the Prince&apos;s visit to Calcutta, which, according to the reports hitherto received, has been highly successful in spite of the boycott efforts. -The Moslem Question. On 23rd December 1921 the Governor of Bombay sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State : &apos; The present situation is one of considerable gravity and one in which it is absolutely vital to peace in India that a prompt settlement of Moslem grievances should be come to. No partial settlement will suffice, and I. do not think that any solution, less than that which 1 have previously suggested will be acceptable here. I ,am aware that in an international matter of this kind, it is impossible to anticipate the decision of the allied conference, but if the Cabinet could announce definitelv what it was going, to stand for at the forthcoming conference, it would have a great effect. I still consider that the greatest dangers could be largely averted if Moslems were promptly pacified. There are signs that they increasingly dislike co-operation with Gandhi, but on the other hand the ill-effects of the caliphate propaganda are rapidly increasing. Please read, in this connexion the last half of my telegram of 15th October on this question. -     :- I desire further to inform you that at a meeting of both halves of my Government this morning, all the Ministers and the Members of Council unanimously recom-mended that I should immediately address you in the above sense by telegram.The telegram of .15th October referred to above was as follows : * &apos; In view of the present situation in India, I feel bound to urge once more upon you my opinion that it is imperative that action should be taken on the Turkish question, which should restore the lost faith of Islam in our attitude towards it. My point of view, and my anxiety to assist in this question, is well known to you from various private letters and telegrams that have reached you from me, but once again an opportunity, so it seems to me, presents itself in the exhaustion of both the combatants in Anatolia, and in other factors of the situation which should be taken immediate advantage of to put EnglancPs position right. In regard to the above, I. have all along held the view that, shorn of the caliphate question, the non-co-operation movement is easily settled, but so long as all. Moslems in India are either actively hostile or sore and distrustful, as they are at present, the situation will remain serious. - ...We have now for very many months tried by patience and firmness to save the situation from becoming worse out here, but I cau only repeat what I have so often urged, that unless we get back to a policy of reconciliation with Islam the situation in India may at any moment become a grave one.
I hope you will not think that I have misread either this situation or the home difficulties, but I. have spent most of my life in studying islam iu Turkey and elsewhere, and I am absolutely confident that a continuation of our present policy towards Islam, or what appears to the public to be our policy towards Islam, will lead to results fatal to our rule in the East.THE DOMINIONS.CANADA.New Cabinet. On 20th. December the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows : I have to-day accepted Mr. Meighen&apos;s resignation, and called on Mr. Mackenzie King to form a Government. He has accepted, and I have now sworn in the following, which form the Cabinet : Hon.   W.   L.   Mackenzie   Prime Minister, Secretary of State for external affairs, and President of Privy Council.

Minister of Agriculture. Minister of Labour.AUSTRALIA.Zinc Industry [B.E.R., Ivii, p. 10]. Referring to the Gbvernor-GenernPs telegram of 12th November, the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent the following telegram on 2nd January :  In the view of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, the offer was essentially a war-time arrangement, proposed on account of the restrictions on raising capital then in force in the United Kingdom, and primarily intended to increase the supplies of spelter for war purposes. After this lapse of time, and the change in circumstances, the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury consider the offer must be regarded as having lapsed ; and having regard to the existing financial condition of the United Kingdom, they  would not feel justified in proposing the revival to Parliament. The matter was &apos; dealt with in a letter of 29th August 1921, from the Chancellor of the Exchequer to your Prime Minister.. - NEW ZEALAND.Air Communications [B.E.R., lix, p. 6]. The following telegram was sent by tho Governor-General on 28th December 1921 in reply to that sent by the Secretary of 36-1 c
State for the Colonies on 13th December 1921: In view of its present financial position, the Government of New Zealand have decided with regret that they cannot make any contribution towards the proposed imperial service.Butter [B.E.R., lix, p. 9]. On 4th January the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows : With further reference to the stocks of New Zealand and Australian butter, which the Imperial Government desires to &quot;dispose of at once, my Prime Minister states that the Commonwealth Prime Minister has arranged, for a conference of producers for 4th January, to discuss the action to be taken regarding proposals for dealing with the entire quantity. New Zealand producers will confer &quot;for a similar purpose on 5th January. Following these meetings, negotiations are almost certain to take place between Australia and New Zealand, regarding joint action, which is of great importance to both countries in view of the serious bearing upon, the current market values. In order to give sufficient time for those negotiations, my Prime Minister earnestly requests that an additional week&apos;s time be granted as from 7th January, before definite action in selling is taken by His Majestys Government. Telegraphic negotiations with Australia could not commence until after the meetings referred to have been held, and although my Government realize that His Majesty&apos;s Government feels the necessity for finality as soon as possible, it is hoped that the request now made for deferring action as regards the sale for an extra week can be granted.SOUTH AFRICA. The following telegrams were sent by ReuteFs agents : Government Manifesto on the Threatened Strike. General Smuts has issued a manifesto appealing to the coUiers, and impressing upon them the necessityfor the most careful consideration before they take any extreme step. The manifesto points out that the Government on many occasions has put pressure upon employers to make concessions, but it feels that in the present circumstances it is impossible and futile to ask for further concessions from the coal-owners alone. It was admitted on all sides that the coal, industry ought to become one of the most important in the Union, and eventually its premier mining industry, but at present it was very seriously endangered, and actually losing the position already attained owing to the lowering of the English export prices. The railway department had already reduced its rates to the utmost. Unless prices were materially lowered, the industry would receive a blow from which it would not soon recover, and the colliers would be the principal sufferers from such a catastrophe, whereas even with the proposed reduction they would still be better off than the gold miners. The manifesto earnestly appeals to the colliers to fall into line with the gold mines in accepting a reduction of wages. In the event of a strike, it concludes, the Government would be obliged to protect public interests by the maintenance of public utility services. [Pretoria, 28th December.]Labour Problems. In addition to the coal dispute, other labour troubles appear to be coining to a head. The Chamber of Mines has notified the South African Industrial Federation of the termination of certain wage agreements, and their intention to withdraw from the status cjuo in connexion with the differentiation iu the employment of white and coloured labour.&apos;J he electric power companies have declined to enter into further. conferences with the Federation or to discuss the increased minimum rates of pay recently demanded by the trade unions.   [Johannesburg, 29th December.]Meeting of Trade Unions Executives. One of the most momentous conferences in the industrial history of the Witwatersrand was opened here this morning, when the joint executives of the trade unions concerned assembled to consider the situation in connexion with the pending disputes affecting the gold and coal mines industries, the Victoria Falls Power Company and the Johannesburg engineering shops. It is expected that the reduction of wages in the, Jafersfontein mines will also be considered.According, to an official statement issued at the conclusion of the, mornings proceedings, various speakers said that an idea was prevalent among the workers,that
an attack to bring down wages was being organized by capitalists all over the world, and that the workers recognized that only by solid organization could they resist with any degree oE success,   [Johannesburg, 30th December.]Strike. The industrial conference has endorsed the decision of the miners to strike, and has promised every assistance. The conference has further decided to take a strike ballot, returnable on 8th January, on all the questions in dispute. It is stated that the speeches were both moderate and serious in tone and that it was evident that the speakers fully realized the weight of responsibility resting upon them.   [Johannesburg, 30th December.]Appeal for Sympathetic Action. The executive of the industrial Federation, who have been in session throughout the entire day, have adopted a resolution advising all workers&apos; organizations to prepare for sympathetic action without delay. Public meetings are to be held for the purpose of presenting the trade unions&apos; case, and the trade unions are organizing an executive which shall be as representative as possible to deal with the situation. The prospects as regards a general strike are at present gloomy.   [Johannesburg, 31st December-.]The Indian. Problem. Addressing the Natal South African party congress to-day, General Smuts made a brief reference to the Indian question. He said that anything they did in Natal or elsewhere in the Union had the most far-reaching influence, an influence which&apos;might even shake the foundations of the Empire. The question of Indians in South Africa was of the first importance, and General Smuts counselled the Indians to avoid trying for a settlement which might do them no good and might do the Empire incalculable harm. In the other parts of the Union the Indian problem was of manageable proportions, but in Natal it was very serious indeed. However, they must not exaggerate the talk about inundation, but must remember that the whites in Natal were more than holding their own. Let them consider the matter carefully, not alone from their own point of view, but from that of all the other Dominions and remember that any decision arrived at would have repercussions fat-beyond Natal and, perhaps, beyond the Empire. He felt that the best thing they could do was to induce the Indians in ever-increasing numbers to leave South Africa and go back to their own country. That, in his opinion, was a solution which was fundamentally sound.   [Pietermaritzburg, 20th December.]
