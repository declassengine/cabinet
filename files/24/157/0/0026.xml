GREAT BRITAIN.The Unemployment Situation. The following paragraphs are taken from the Special Report on Unemployment  or the week ended 1.7th March 1922, issued by the Ministry of Labour : The reports received do not record the full effect of the lock-out in the engineering trades, although an adverse result in industry in general is anticipated. In coal-mining there is, at present, improvement everywhere, but the steel and iron industry is at a standstill.   In shipbuilding a dearth of new work continues.The improvement in the cotton industry has been maintained, although the position in Scotland is not good. There is no change to report in the woollen trade, but jute and linen are bad in Scotland. There is no change in the hosiery and lace trade.In general engineering the position is extremely difficult owing to the lock-out. In the pottery and china industry further improvement is shown, while there are signs of decreasing activity in the glass trade. All branches of the wholesale clothing trade show improvement, and there has been considerable activity in seasonal trade painting, building and retail clothing.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.IRAQ.Draft Treaty with King Feisal [B.E.R., lxiv, p. 4].-On 19th March the High Commissioner telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in regard to article 5 of the treaty, saying that the Colonial Office alternative draft would in his personal opinion be accepted, but he was sure that the Foreign Office wording would not be accepted and would injure King FeisaPs prestige vitally.INDIA.The Viceroy&apos;s Fortnightly Reports. The following reports were sent on 11th and J25th March:-I. (11th March). Section 1. Madras. There has been a distinct lull in political activity during the second half of February, the Bardoli decision having been received with relief.Berar. The effect of the All-India congress committee partial reversion of the Bardoli decision cannot yet be fully gauged.Section 2. Guntur. The situation has considerably improved and the collection of the land revenue is proceeding fairly well in Kistna and. Godavari. The movement, for non-payment of taxes collapsed and the revenue is coming in normally.Section 3. There has been a good deal of volunteer activity in several quarters. In Ganjam anti-European feeling at times is much in evidence. On the whole, however, the activities of the volunteers has been less offensive and aggressive than, in the last fortnight.Section 4. A scheme of relief has been sanctioned for the issue of loans on easy terms to those requiring assistance in Malabar. Mrs. Naidu made an objectionable &apos; speech about the atrocities committed by the minions of martial law.Bombay. Gandhi has gone back to Bardoli, and, with Patel, intends to supervise and direct the propaganda there for the constructive part of the programme decided at
Bardoli. In view of tlie statement that neither the Bardoli nor the Delhi decisions are applicable, and as civil disobedience against the municipality is purely local and not an All-India issue, it is reported that the non-co-operators intend to start a campaign against the payment of municipal taxes in Surat.Section 5. Owing to the caliphate and non-co-operation movement, moslem feeling continues to be strained, and endeavours are being made to bring about hartal in Karachi on the occasion of the visit of His Royal Highness. A favourable turn in the negotiations for a Turkish settlement might have far-reaching results.Section 6. Punjab. His Royal Highness has everywhere been given a very hearty welcome during his recent visit and there has been no untoward incident. The visit had a heartening effect on the loyal classes, specially, in Lahore. Lahore observed hartal by closing shops, but there was no interference with those who -wished to take part iu welcoming, and no cases of intimidation.Section 7. The temporary suspension of civil disobedience had a sobering -effect on the activities of the non-co-operationists, particularly in towns. During the fortnight, however, 35U political or semi-political meetings and numerous violent speeches were delivered, specially by the sikhs at village meetings. The numbers of the akali are rapidly increasing and the movement gives serious cause for anxiety. The akalis are regarded by the sikh villagers as a privileged class, as they move about in armed bands, travel without tickets and display contempt for the Govern-meut. The less violent members of the gurdwara parbaudhak committee are alarmed at&apos;the rebellious spirit shown by them, and the tendency towards a split between the religious and political parties is more marked. The akalis have taken forcible possession of the gurdwara at Heran, and of the Darbar Sahib at Hafizabad. Mohamedan agitators for the most part have joined the congress party. Police officers come in for a good deal of abuse and obstruction, particularly in the sikh villages. The future of the non-co-operation movement depends on the activities of the big leaders outside the province. The majority of respectable people are alarmed at the growing lawlessness, and one deputy-commissioner reports that, although agitators (? omission) sullen, the educated classes, including the leaders of the bar, are at the back of the Government,&apos; as well as the military pensioners. Action on lines reported last fortnight against the akali movement is contemplated now that the police force, tied up by His Royal li?guness&apos;s visit, is available. We have also addressed the Punjab regarding the akali situation, and urged that disarmament should be carried out vigorously and promptly. We have asked for a report as early as possible of the extent to which the bands have been disarmed and the effect of this measure, and also for weekly reports of the akali situation.Section 8. A press report just received states that the notification declaring voluuteer corps unlawful has been withdrawn from Attock, Mianwala, Jhelum, Gujrat, Kangra, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh, Jhang, Montgomery and Simla. In none of these districts has the volunteer movement been conspicuous.Bengal. The obstructive activities of the volunteers continue, eg., in Chittagong, the following incidents are reported : assaults on police and forest officers in. their duties, stopping of transportation of materials by the. Public Works Department, threatening coolies and contractors, entering reserved forests, burning rest houses and inspection bungalows, holding meetings in defiance of orders, boycotting tea gardens,, markets, and attempting to cut off supplies.Section 9. Local, officers, consulted as to the present policy, are practically unanimous in favour of its continuance ; even the district officers, who have not been used to special powers, are appealing for a continuance as to the reserve. There is a widespread tendency to lawlessness, illustrated by the three cases, in which firing had to be resorted to, viz.: Madarihat, Jalpaguri Dooars, Rangpur Tipperah. The attitude of the Bengal delegates before and at the congress showed clear indications of a wish to break away from GandhPs dictatorship and run the provincial congress organizations on their own, more violeut, lines. The result of the congress decision will probably be a considerable revival of the picketting of excise and cloth shops, but the dominant factor is a growing spirit of lawlessness both iu towns and districts, which the congress element is utterly unable to control or direct, The leaders can only retain their position by going wdiere the mob drives them, and they will be forced to countenance violence in an increasing degree. We have drawn the attention of the Bengal Government to the steps taken in the united Provinces and Punjab to enrol additional police armed with modern rifles, which can be supplied for other provinces also.
Bihar and Orissa.-The lull in the activities of non-co-operators continues,, though there is a certain amount of tension. The European population is much alarmed at the prospect of the removal of the company of British troops at Muzaffarpur. A squadron of Indian cavalry, asked for by &quot;the local Government, is being sent there. There is reason to believe that the collection.of the cost of the additional police posted^ in North Champaran and Sitamarhi will be resisted, and made a test case of civil disobedience. There has been a demonstration against the police in many districts, and the prevailing disregard for constituted authority is shown by several incidents, such, as the rescue of three persons from custody in &quot;the Purnea district. The commissioner of Tirhoot thinks that the leaders of the non-co-operation party are anxious to commence civil disobedience, and not anxious that it should be non-violent. It is improbable that in any case they can control their followers.   In Shahabad, non-co-operators tided to fly the swaraj Hag.Central Provinces. The Bardoli decision lias been generally welcomed by the non-co-operation party; but the effect of the congress decision practically to-reverse the Bardoli resolution cannot yet be possibly estimated. The campaign for the enrolment of volunteers continues somewhat half-heartedly. In the Chatisgarh division, where there was some attempt to stir up trouble over the payment of rent, the religious leader of the satnami chamars pronounced it a bounden duty to support the Government, to pay the Government revenue, and to remain always ready for bcgar and other duty. The municipal elections are proving, on the whole,, a triumph, lor the non-co-operation parly. Licence fees have Increased, at the excise1 sales and no obstruction caused.United Provinces. No signs of improvement: the unrest has spread in the rural area. There has been significant instances from Sultanpur, where a large crowd followed the sub-inspector, with two arrested men, to the police station. Violence was apparently only averted by the prompt reinforcement, from outside, including die deputy-commissioner. Similar measures had to betaken in Gonda to forestall a rumoured attack on the police station ; and the collector at Moradabad had to drive off a demonstration from his camp. There are signs of renewed agrarian unrest in Fiardoi, Pai Bareli and Sitapttr.Assam. The commissioner of the Assam Valley states that the reports from the districts are decidedly encouraging; revenue is coming in fairly well; the temper of villagers-is more friendly than formerly; but the necessity of constant vigilance is still clear. The improvement in the situation is due to the arrest of the leading agitators and the obvious determination of the Government to maintain law and order. As long as the Government acts firmly, there is no great fear of the volunteers recovering the ascendancy. A demonstration march of the Assam Bides in the Sibsagar district had good results. Tea garden coolies continue to be unsettled in Cachar and Sibsagar. Temporarily, the non-co-operation agitation has lost ground, but the mohamedans are sullen and discontented wherever they form an important element of the population, and the possibility of trouble from this source cannot be overlooked.Burma.-The lull in political activity continues, and the only sign of life amongst the ISnrman politicians is coining from itinerant monks.North-West Frontier Province. Little political activity. Crime normal, and crop prospects excellent.Section 1.0. Delhi. The caliphate conference was held on 25th February. A resolution, declaring that non-co-operation with all its stages and strictest non-violence, was the only means of attaining the caliphate demand, was passed. Another resolution, the effect of which was that the caliphate committee should confine its activities to the religious duty of upholding the caliphate movement while mohamedans who also desired to take part in the swaraj movement should do so from the platform of the congress, was deferred for consideration at a meeting to be held at Ajmere on or. about 4th March. We have not yet received any report of the proceedings of this meeting.Section 11. General. At the All-India congress committee at Delhi there was ;great opposition to the Bardoli resolutions, especially by the delegates from Bengal and Punjab, and Gandhi was forced to put forward a resolution which, with the exception of mass civil disobedience, practically leaves things as they were before the Bardoli decisions. For the time being, his position and influence appear to have been weakened. The lull in political activity, as the result, of these decisions, continues in some &apos;quarters, but it is impossible to say how long this will last.   The most
&apos; &apos; &apos;    &apos; &apos; : 5 i &apos;   -serious factors are lawlessness in tlie mofussil in Bengal, in Oudh, where, in some districts, tenants are again showing active hostility to landlords, and in part of Bihar and Orissa; the sullen attitude of the mohamedan population and the akali movement in Punjab. We expect to receive next week a report on the effect of the measures taken against the akalis. A route march of troops through parts of Oudh is being arranged. The whole situation is being closely, watched,&apos;but there is much inflamatory-mable material in all four northern provinces, and developments during the next few months cannot be forecast with any certainty.IP (25th March.) Bombay.-The news regarding Gandhi&apos;s arrest was received quietly throughout the presidency, and with a reported feeling of relief in business circles. Mr. Monfagu&apos;s resignation and the financial situation also contributed to overshadow GandhPs arrest. The former has caused apprehension as to the nego-tiations in connexion with the Turkish treaty and the smooth working of reforms; during the trial of, and at his conviction the atmosphere was perfectly calm.Section 2. A. report has been received of the resignation of Shiv Dasahara Mamat, 1.0.S., on account of GandhPs arrest,Bengal. The lull in political activity continues. GandhPs arrest failed to produce excitement; a general tendency to lawlessness continues in various parts of the presidency, resulting in more or less serious riots and attacks on public servants, e.g., at Pubna, Nadia, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Tipperah and Brahmanbaria. In some districts a refusal to pay union rates or the chaukidari tax is a prominent feature, especially in Midnapur. Vigorous action taken to ensure payment has been attended with considerable success. The strike on the East Indian Railway continued during, the first fortnight of March, but, in spite of several cases of assault and intimidation and extensive looting, of railway waggons, it has on the whole been free from disturbance.Section 3. The calmness with which the news of GandhPs arrest was received was hardly expected, and it is early yet to place a final interpretation of the party issue. Elaborate instructions were issued for no hartal or excitements (sic ? incitement). The leaders in Bengal realize that they no longer load, and are anxious to reorganize before their hands are forced. The most serious feature in the situation is the extent to which the masses are out of control. Lawlessness prevails in far too many places, and manifests itself in too many incidents, to permit of entire confidence as to the future ; outwardly, at any rate, however, the general situation has improved, but it-will be up-hill work, under discouraging conditions, to reassert respect for law and order, while apprehension exists that more may be going on. beneath the&apos;surface than is known.United Provinces. The news of Gandhi&apos;s arrest fell, flat, Crop-cutting has begun, and consequently there is a temporary lull in political excitement; but, in many areas described, as quieter, the real position is regarded as far from satisfactory. An officer has been appointed on special duty to enquire into the eka or aika movement. Already 69 prosecutions are arising out of it, and a squadron of cavalry has been, sent on. a march of demonstration through the affected areas. Another demonstration is contemplated, in the Fyzabad division, and here, as in tho Lucknow division, an opportunity will be taken to square accounts with local characters and rural agitators.Section 4. The legal scrutiny of convictions under the Criminal Law Amend-ment Act (vide fortnightly telegram dated 28th February) has resulted so far in the release of 1.7 persons, including Jawahir Lai Nehru and the six Lucknow leaders.Section 5. Dacoity is rife, especially in Bara Banki, where the dacoits chiefly consist of volunteers of low type associated, with posts and bad characters.Section 6. Punjab. The demand for nine lakhs for additional police, owing to the disturbed conditions and the akali menace, passed without discussion and without a single dissentient in the local council.Section 7. The substantial classes regard disorder with marked dislike. The lull of the congress and caliphate activities continue, and is particularly noticeable in the towns. There is but little picketting, and the volunteer organizations in some districts are being disbanded, though in some quarters congress volunteers are still aggressive. The news of GandhPs arrest caused little or no excitement. His in-fluence has been on the wane for the last few weeks. lire political situation as regards the sikh agitation has not improved.   The akalis are truculent and the tone of38-5 B
speeches bad; the overthrow, of the Government and the establishment ofKhalsa rule is reported as being openly, discussed&apos;- in the J-ullundur division. The presence of: troops, exempli gratia, at Ploshiarpur, has a sobering effect in the immediate.vicinity, but it disappears as soon, as they are moved. At the moment intensive action, is being taken in 13 districts against the akali bands ; systematic and simultaneous measures are to be taken.   Instructions have been issued to district officers-(1) to secure offenders and disperse- the bands likely to cause a breach of the peace;(2) to deal with persons who have committed cognizable offences in the seizure of&apos; shrines, whose prosecution has been held up ;(3) to secure also (a) leaders and organizers, of dangerous bands to be dealt with under sections 15 and 17 (2); Act Id- of 1908 ; (b) persons guilty of intimidation or violence in any form; (c) persons who have taken a prominent part in. meetings where speeches were made such as to&apos; justify prosecution under chapter 6, Indian Penal Code; (d) ordinary criminals; (e) members of unlawful assemblies who have not dispersed when required to do so, should be dispersed under provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.Officers have been impressed with the necessity of achieving; these objects with as little show (sic) of force as possible, but have been instructed that, if necessary, they must be enforced even at tbe cost of bloodshed. The assertion of authority by the arrest of the leading organizers, and the break up of bands, if successfully achieved, should exercise pacific effect in the province. We have not yet received a written report regarding these operations, but a brief telegraphic report, indicates that they are proceeding satisfactorily and that there has been no disturbance. In regard to the religious aspects of the sikh movement, the Government is in touch with the gurdwara parbandhak committee, and a bill is being drafted in regard to gurdvvara reform(s), which it is hoped will secure the support of all parties.Au ineffectual attempt was made to arrange a sympathetic meeting at Patna ; probably the not-co-operationists are undecided whether they should confine them-selves to the Bardoli programme, or to undertake the picketting of liquor and cloth shops on. a more extensive scale. It seems probable that the collection of the cost of additional police iii Sitamarki and north of Chainparan will be resented and made a test of civil disobedience. -.The situation in the Santal parganas is steadily deteriorating, but, in Orissa and Chota -Nagpur, there is a general absence of political agitation.Section 8. In regard, to the kirpan the local Government feel that it should lie dealt with according to the manner in which it is employed rather than according to standards of length. The parbandhak committee issued instructions in this sense that kirpans should be worn at the side and only drawn for purposes of prayer, and there should be no brandishing or show of force by means of the kirpan. The Government-are at present dealing with the question on these lines.Bihar and Orissa. The lull in non-co-operation activities continues, and. apart from the revival of picketting of liquor shops in Purnea and the Santal parganas, and two cases of assault on two planters in. Tirhuf, there is.but little to bring to-notice.   GandhTs arrest has caused no excitement.Section 9. Central Provinces. The fortnight has been devoid of incident: There has been some increase in the number: of political meetings ; some prosecutions have been instituted. Activity is the most conspicuous in Chatisgarh, but the lull continues in Berar; excise sales have generally passed off without incident. The news of GandhTs arrest has been calmly received throughout the province. There have been no alarming conditions, save a- few meetings, and no demonstrations. The attempt to stop, all lloli ^festivities, as a mark of mourning, generally failed.Assam. Tire reports from the districts of the Assam Valley, continue satisfactory. Revenue is coming in more rapidly than in normal years, due to the strong executive measures to secure its- payment. The-institutions of criminal and civil1 cases are increasing; interference with marketshas almost disappeared, and sales of foreign, cloth are recovering. In the Surma Valley-improvement is reported; the demonstration, forces of the Assam Rifles are now transferred to Sylhet, and wilPvisit some of the-tea-areas likely to. be. unsettled aud also. Kanairghat neighbourhood. In Sylhet the meetings and processions have ceased. There is reason to hope that the conditions-for the greater part of i the Assam Valley are, for the time being, approaching the normal,1
and in the Surma- Valley, -brighter than before.    There are clear indications of weakening of the non-co-operation movement. The caliphate movement is stilPa&apos; danger, but for the moment somewhat out of favour. There is no mention of the reception of the news of Ciandhi&apos;s arrest and conviction, so it is presuniedit caused, no excitement.Section 10. North-West Frontier Province. The outstanding event is His Royal&apos; Highness&apos;^ visit to Peshawar, where the warm welcome given by the bulk of the&apos; inhabitants was somewhat marred by the action of the hooligan element of the city and hartal, but the shopkeepers lined the streets, and every point of vantage ill windows, roofs and balconies was filled by spectators. Picketting by the caliphate volunteers, however, reduced the number of spectators.Section II. Two organized gangs attempted to interrupt at the Hastings memorial, on the occasion of the provincial address, but it was not taken up by the spectators, and caused deep resentment among the durbaris. The repudiation by the Delhi conference of the Uardoli resolutions had encouraged the caliphate agitators, and the hooligan element continued to cause annoyance throughout, the visit, eg., a retired risaldar-majoFs face was blackened, Europeans and Indians, gentlemen aud. officers, were insulted, ami the decorations were torn down at Mela on 6th. The, ringleaders have now been arrested and steps taken to restore the city to its senses.  &apos;Delhi. There has been no political activity during the last fortnight, GandhPs arrest being received with apathy.Section VI, The local congress committee have fallen into line with him (sic) Bardoli programme, and have published the decision to concentrate on the collection of members and funds. The non-co-operation party are making a great effort to capture a number of seats on the enlarged municipal committee.Section 13, Since the postponement of civil disobedience there has been a sudden collapse among the volunteers undergoing imprisonment, and large numbers of applications for the conditions of pardon have been made, and they have been released on giving the undertaking. The return of the &quot; heroes &quot; has rather damped political ardour amongst the lower classes.Madras. The lull still continues, and many districts report the complete cessation of non-co-operation activity. The arrest of Gandhi was received with remarkable indifference. In Guntur satisfactory progress has been made with the collection of revenue, aud a more healthy respect for authority is growing up in the most truculent villages. In the north of A root and in Trichinopoly there is still a certain amount of volunteer activity ; elsewhere volunteers are not much in evidence. In Malabar the Government have decided, as a means of dealing with the very large number of Mapillas, against whom there are complaints of participation in the rebellion,, to suspend such sentences of imprisonment as may be passed, and leave (?) them to * pay heavy lines. Sentences of imprisonment will be liable to revival in the case of bad characters. Generally, there are no local reasons for anticipating trouble in the near future.General. The general conditions for the time being are quieter than they have been for some time past. How long this will continue depends largely on the line pursued by the non-co-operators. The report of the proceedings of the working-committee of congress indicates that the plan of campaign favoured is to go slowly for the next few months, concentrating on so-called, constructive items, and to rope in as many moderates as possible; this to be followed by the resumption, in June, of the original programme, except mass civil disobedience. Information from a private source also suggests that attempts may be made to capture labour with the object of bringing about a general strike, but it is difficult to say how far this belated move will be seriously pressed. At a meeting at Ahmedabad, differences disclosed them-selves between Setli. Ghotani and others on the one side, and Ajmal Khan atuPAnsari Oil the other, and these may be the beginning of a split between the caliphate wing, which is concerned with the religious and Turkish issue, and the other wing, which has used the caliphate agitation as. a means of strengthening the non-co-operation movement; With the result that the former may abandon or modify their attitudeof uncompromising hostility towards the Government, whose attitude in the Turkish question seems to have made a strong impression on them. Private information also indicates that a considerable number of those who attended the meeting at A j mere of Jamiat-ul-nlema were disposed to take a similar line. :38-5 C
I,. Visit of the Prince of Wales. The following telegram [357 S.] was sent by the Viceroy to the Secretary of State for India on 22nd March : Pending the receipt of detailed reports from the centres visited by the Prince, I feel it desirable to convey to His Majesty&apos;s Government a .brief general appreciation of the effect of the tour. Apart from the activities of the extremist minority, who endeavoured in certain centres in British India to boycott the visit aud create disturbances, the reception accorded His Royal Highness has everywhere been respectful, and has evoked intense and general enthusiasm. The personal charm of His Royal Highness, and his democratic sympathies, captivated the people, and strengthened their traditional loyalty to the Royal House. Even in places where the extremist element had been prominent in recent years the masses of the people threw themselves whole-heartedly into the general welcome.The special interest displayed by His Royal Highness, on all occasions, in the array in India, was highly appreciated by the troops and pensioners, who acclaimed him as a friend and comrade.In the Indian States, as was to be expected, enthusiasm was universal, and in keeping with the proverbial loyalty of the Princes. The popular demonstrations in large cities like Hyderabad and Mysore showed that the people fully shared the loyalty of their rulers. The general effect of the visit has more than satisfied our expectations. It has confirmed the loyalty of the masses, and demonstrated that the attachment of India to the Throne stands on a foundation which nothing can destroy.We are deeply grateful to His Royal Highness.THE DOMINIONS.Reparation. On loth March the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of (Janada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa for transmission to their Prime Ministers:--A conference of the allied Finance Ministers has just been held in Paris. On outstanding questions as to the repartition of German payments the Finance Ministers arrived at complete agreement and decided to leave the duty of fixing the German payments in cash and in kind in .1922 to the Reparation Commission. The Finance Ministers decided, as regards the reparation problem generally, to impress upon the Reparation Commission the necessity of arriving at concrete solutions aiming at restoring order to German finance with a view to enabling Germany to pay off, by 6 foreign loans, some of the capital of her debt.Great Britain will receive, out of the cash paid by Germany in 1921, 500 million gold marks on account of the cost of occupation before 1st May 1921, including 450 already provisionally paid over. On the same account France will receive 140, and Belgium tbe remainder towards her priority. The total cost of the Belgian, British and French armies of occupation will be limited from 1st May 1922 to sums equivalent to 220 million gold marks annually as a maximum. The -costs of occupation from 1st May 1921 to 31st December 1922 will be debited against . deliveries in kind received, including the proceeds of the Reparation Recovery Act. Sixty-live per cent, of the deliveries in kind during 1922 will be allotted to France, and 35 per cent, to other Powers. Subject in -all cases to any adjustments necessary, our share will be 24 per cent, of this 35 per cent. The Wiesbaden agreement will be approved for three years subject to certain financial modifications. Up to their share of 35 per cent, mentioned above, other Powers will be entitled to make similar agreements. The Powers will retain, without being called upon to make cash payment, deliveries in kind up to 31st December 1922. The value of the Saar mines will be debited to France as delivery in kind during 19^2 to the extent of 300 million gold marks, any balance to be liquidated in C. Bonds. During the conference the U.S.A. Government claimed that before any reparation payments are made the cost of its army of occupation should be satisfied. The Finance Ministers, while reserving the rights of the U.S.A., informed the United States representative that as the Finance Ministers were acting under the treaty of Versailles, to which the U.S.A. was not a party, they considered the matter should be dealt with through diplomatic channels. .
Signature of League of Nations Protocols [B.E.R., lxv, p. 7].-In reply.to the -circular telegram sent by the Secretary of State on 8th March the Governor-General of New Zealand telegraphed as follows on 16th March :-The Government of New Zealand concurs in the ratification of the protocols embodying amendments to the covenant of the League of Nations excepting those relating to article 16, and arrangements are being made for Sir James Allen to sign the protocols in question prior to ratification. **AUSTRALIA.Commercial Relations with Norway. On 21th March the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General:  The Government of Norway wish to open negotiations with a view to concluding a temporary agreement as to commercial relations between Norway and the Common-Wealth of Australia. Do your Ministers desire to enter into such negotiations and if so what procedure would they suggest?The Dried Fruit Industry [B.E.R., Ixii, p. 0].-On 21th March the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Governor-General in reply to his telegram of 28th January, saying :-We have carefully examined your proposal, but are faced with following difficulties : First. The preference which you propose is equivalent to 14*. percwt. on currants and 18s. Sd. per Cwt. on raisins and other dried fruits, he., far greater than the whole -of the present duties on such fruits, which are 2s. per cwt. and 10s. Gd. per cwt. respectively, with preferential rebate of one-sixth on Empire produce except that no (sic) duty on peaches. To give effect to the proposal of the Commonwealth Government would involve, therefore, a very large increase in the duty leviable on dried fruits derived from non-Empire countries, which are by far the largest sources of supply. Even if preference equivalent to the whole, or nearly the whole, amount of the increased duty were given to imperial produce, the result would be an increase in the price of -a food which, in the case of the cheaper varieties,.is largely consumed by the working classes in this country.Secondly. The preference proposed would be greatly in excess of the general preference of one-sixth incorporated in the Finance Act, 1919, and if given effect to would inevitably lead to reactions on the British Exchequer which in the present financial circumstances we could not face.For the above reasons, whilst we have every sympathy with the object aimed at, we fear that it is quite impracticable to grant the proposed preference.The Tariff Board. The High Commissioner for Australia has been advised that -the Commonwealth Tariff Board, created by the Tariff Board Act passed by the Federal Parliament last year, has now been constituted by the appointment of Mr II. M. Oakley (chairman), Mr. Herbert Brookes and Mr. Walter Leitch; Mr. Oakley is the Acting Deputy-Comptroller of Customs ; Mr. Brookes, who is a past president, of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia, is the representative of the luaiiu-facturers; while Mr. Leitch, O.B.E., who was Australia^ Director of Munitions during the war, and the first Director of the Commonwealth Bureau of Commerce and Industry, will represent the importers.The operation of the anti-dumping proposals of the Commonwealth Government, -enacted in December last in the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act, will be tbe care ol: the new Board, aud among its most important responsibilities will be that of advising as to the imposition of the duties provided for by that Act.The &quot;dumping duties &quot; are intended to prevent injury to Australian industries by the sale of goods from other countries at prices below the normal cost of their production. These duties will safeguard the manufacturing industries of Australia, that is to say, against the unfair competition of countries whose circumstances allow them to sell their goods at less than normal prices. As specified by the Australian Act, dumping duties are to be imposed in respect of goods exported to Australia and sold to an importer- there at a price likely to be detrimental to an Australian industry goods consigned to Australia which may similarly be sold there at less than a reasonable price-goods carried to Australia at freight rates which are lower than the prevailing rates and goods sold to an importer in Australia at prices made
