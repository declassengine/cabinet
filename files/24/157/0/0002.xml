GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraphs are taken from the reports of the Ministry of Labour for the weeks ending .12th and 19th April: Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.-As a result of the national stoppage of work in coal mines the problem has arisen whether the miners are eligible for benefit under this Act. Numbers of miners, acting on die instructions of their various county associations, applied to the local employment exchanges for unemployment benefit.. The employment exchanges, acting on the instructions of the chief insurance officer,, refused unemployment benefit to the men, and the cases were then referred to the various courts of referees for the districts, in accordance with the provisions of the-Act. The claims were in every instance disallowed, on the ground that the men were unemployed owing to a trade dispute, and therefore were not eligible for assistance under the Act, and notices of appeal were at once lodged on behalf of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.The appeals were duly referred to the umpire, and test cases were heard by him on the 7th and Sth April. The grounds of the appeal in the principal test case were as follows: (1) That the insured contributor was unable at all material times to obtain suitable employment, in that the only offer of employment in the district where he was last usually employed was at a rate of wage lower than that habitually obtained in usual employment in that district, or would have obtained had he continued to be so employed. (2) That the insured contributor did not lose his employment by reason of a stoppage of work, which was dtie to a trade dispute at the mine at which he was employed, in that the employers gave notice terminating the contract of the insured contributor, apart from, any trade dispute, and only offered him employment at a rate of wage lower than that which he habitually obtained in his usual employment or would have obtained had he continued to be so employed. (3) That the provisions of section VII (3) and (6) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, are affected by the fact that the refusal to offer employment except at a rate of wage lower than that which the insured contributor habitually obtained in his ordinary employment in that district, or would have obtained had he continued to be so employed, was a concerted refusal by a number of employers and not an individual refusal. The decision of the umpire was against the appeal, on the ground that the notices from the employers to the applicants, terminating existing engagements on the 31st March, contained an invitation to negotiate through the work.men&apos;s representatives for the continuance of work without interruption on the expiry of the notice.   The facts that the offer to negotiate regarding fresh terms was made and was not accepted, and that work ceased on the expiry of the existing engagements, constituted a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute, ami therefore the applicants were not eligible for unemployment benefit under the existing regulations of the Act.The Labour Situation during the.Week ending ]Qth April. The most important event of the week was the decision on the 15th April of the National Union of Rail-waymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, together with the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, to cancel, their proposed strike in support of the miners. By the avoidance of a Triple Alliance strike the coal dispute has again taken the foremost place in the situation. The national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation is to meet on the 22nd, and until that meeting no farther developments of importance are anticipated.The extent to which the principles involved in the dispute have been discussed publicly iu the columns of the press and elsewhere by outside parties, in a neutral spirit, has been remarkable. On the other hand, the passive attitude of the national Labour bodies, such as the trade union congress and the Labour party, is noticeable when contrasted with their activity during the past 1.8 months, aud in view of the hopes expressed at. the time of the railway strike of 191.9 regarding the part they might play in similar future emergencies.
From the point of view, therefore, of the reaction upon trade union organization -of the present movement towards lower wage rates, such an. event as the conference between members of the parliamentary committee of the trades union congress and representatives connected with the woodworking trades, mentioned in last week&apos;s report, is of more importance than any of the events in connection with the coal dispute. A similar development is the establishment of a joint committee to formulate .a common policy for the employees of London wholesale and retail distributive firms in resisting threatened wages reductions.Important developments may bo expected in the building trades in the course of the next few days. The National Federation of Building Trades.Operatives have not revised their attitude of hostility towards the scheme for the augmentation of labour in the building trades by trained ex-service men, but after the meetings referred to below8&apos; the position should be much clearer with regard to the proposed establishment -of a national wages and conditions council and the proposed national variation of wages by means of a cost-of-li ving sliding scale.The agreement between lhe Shipping Kraployers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding trades on the subject of reductions in wages, which is subject to confirmation by the trade-unions concerned, is dealt with below.*A conference of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation opened at Geneva on the 18th April. The annual meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress will open at Aberdeen on the 20th. On the 27th. and 28th a national conference of. Labour women will be held in Manchester under the auspices of the national Labour party.* Not reproduced.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.A British Union.-ReuteFs agent reported from Cairo on 20jfch April that at a large meeting of the unofficial British community held at the Continental Hotel that -day, a resolution had been passed confirming the decision to form a British Union to watch British interests in Egypt.   Mr. Kingsford had been elected chairman.INDIA.The Frontier Situation [B.E.R., xli, p. 2]. The Viceroy reported [No. 2-10] on 14th April that the activity of the enemy in Waziristan had been increasing. Our protective troops and convoys had been subjected to organized attacks, in which hand-to-hand fighting had occurred. The enemy had been beaten off in every case with considerable loss, but our own casualties, in the period from 5th April to 10th April inclusive, amounted tu 2 officers-one British-and 32 other ranks and followers killed, and 2 officers and 74 other ranks and followers wounded.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R.,, xii, p. 2], The Viceroy transmitted [518 S.] on 12th April a further communication from Sir Henry Dobbs, in which, referring to his message of Gth April, he said that he had been officially notified by Tarsi, that 11th April had been fixed for his farewell audience of the Amir. Owing to the death of his favourite uncle the Amir suspended all business) but Sir Henry insisted that he must return on the 12th, and the Amir consented to receive a visit of condolence from him on 9th April. A long discussion of the situation took place, dealing especially with the questions of consulates, British support to Afghanistan in case she incurred Russian enmity, and the importation of arms. Sir Henry made it clear that the. -cession of Arnawai and the Afghan proposals regarding the tribes were impossible. The attitude of the Amir and of Tarsi was extraordinarily open and friendly, and Sir Henry had been left with the impression that the Afghans dreaded a breach with us, but were in a difficulty as to how to settle matters with the Russians regarding the consulates, which the latter evidently regarded as the clou of the treaty. Sir Henry urged that His Majesty&apos;s Government should put pressure on the Russians
to forgo the consulates, and should promise definite support to Afghanistan in &quot;tire-event of her incurring the enmity of Russia. -   -The Viceroy endorsed Sir Henry&apos;s recommendations.The Secretary of State replied [2028] to the above on 15th April. He said that, after consultation with the Foreign Office, he thought it would be unwise to put pressure on the Russians, in whom too much trust could not be reposed, in regard to the consulates in eastern Afghanistan. He indicated the line which might be taken up by the Russians, and the possibility of other objectionable matter being found in the treaty should the consulate question be dropped and the treaty concluded. Consequently, he deprecated the course advocated by Sir Henry Dobbs and endorsed by the Viceroy. At, the same time he appreciated the advantageous position which the former seemed to have obtained as to detaching the Afghans from the Bolsheviks by a comprehensive offer of assistance from us, and asked for the further views of the Viceroy as to the. length to which the Indian Government was prepared to go in the provision of money and arms.Sir Henry Dobbs continued his reports on J3th April, transmitted [538 S.] by the Viceroy on lbth April. He reported the discussion in two private conferences of several clauses, six in number, of the British draft treaty, and stated that the Afghans had shown themselves very friendly and tractable.This was followed by a telegram dated 15th April, transmitted [551 S.] by the-Viceroy on 20th April, in which he reported the discussion of six other clauses, on which generally satisfactory conclusions had been reached, in -the two days&apos; meetings he had had with Tarsi. The remaining clauses were to be discussed in the presence of the Amir on 16th April. Tarsi had stated at the end of the meeting that it was doubtful if Afghanistan could make any treaty with Russia, as she questioned the earnestness of the latter regarding the grant of independence to Khiva and Bokhara,, on which Afghanistan set great stoie. He had again raised the question of British support with money and arms in the event of a rupture with Russia and subsequent aggression by the latter.Sir Henry reported that the Amir of Afghanistan was evidently in close-association with the Amir of Bokhara. Tarsi had stated definitely that Afghanistan had not the least intention of attacking Russia for the sake of Bokhara, but that he desired an assurance of help only in the event of Russia attacking Afghanistan on account of her refusal to make a treaty.On 17th April Sir Henry reported a seven hours&apos; conference with the Amir and Tarsi. He expressed his opinion that the situation was,hopeless, and that unless the-Amir accepted the controversial clauses en bloc, without further argument, he would have to leave.   Be was sending an appreciation of the situation.With reference to this, the Viceroy telegraphed [55478.] on 20th April that the-changes at Kabul were loo sudden and violent to permit them being considered as altogether genuine. The Indian Government hoped that, just, as Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; views.regarding the.Afghan readiness to discard the Russian treaty had appeared to-be &quot;optimistic, so bis opinions about their latest attitude towards us might be regarded as-pessimistic.On 22nd April the Viceroy transmitted [5G2 S.] a telegram from Sir Henry Dobbs, darted 18th April, reporting a long conference with the Amir. Referring to-secret treaties and secret clauses in the Russo-Afghan treaty, Sir Henry had insisted on open treatment, and told the Amir that, if agreement regarding the draft treaty was reached all agreements, secret or otherwise, effected or intended between Afghanistan and other Powers, must be communicated before our treaty was signed. He protested against the Amir&apos;s requirement that our assurance of assistance must, be-secret, but the Amir appeared to be impracticable on this point.Consideration was then given to the controversial clauses in the draft treaty.. Having asserted that the retention of Arnawai was necessary to Afghan honour, the Amir eventually yielded on the question. He then asked for an undertaking not to-fortify Tandy Sar, but after heated argument said he would withdraw his request if satisfied with the rest of the treaty. A long discussion regarding the tribes ensued. The Amir persisted in requiring an amnesty for all offences by Afridis, Mahsuds and Waziris against the Government as distinct from private persons from the beginning of the Afghan war up to the present time. After live hours&apos; discussion on this question the conference came to an end, the Amir expressing the hope that Tarsi and Sir Henry would be able to evolve some satisfactory formula.
Sir Henry went 011 to report that if the amnesty question stood alone he would he disposed to support it in the interests of peace. But the atmosphere of secrecy and intrigue which pervaded the country compelled mistrust of Afghanistan in her present mood. He thought it would be best for us to stand aside while Afghanistan was endeavouring to deal with so many different groups British, Bolshevik, Keinalists, Jamalists, Bokharans, &amp;c-at the same time. She was likely to come to grief in her endeavours, and it would be advisable for us to wait for that event. He proposed to inform the Amir that, unless he accepted the controversial clauses as they stood and a public assurance against aggression by a third Power, and disclosed ail secret agreements, ho was instructed to break off proceedings. His reason for this change was that he thought the Afghans would be more disposed to come round to us if we appeared to stand aloof as disgusted friends rather than as threatening enemies.The Viceroy&apos;s Weekly Reports. The following telegram was sent on 20th April :-Section 1. Madras.-Mohamed Ali and Shaukat Ali addressed the Moslem volunteers&apos; conference at Erode, at which the former made a violent speech, but declared, that, though ho was in favour of violence, out of deference to Gandhi at present he did not advocate it.Section 2. We have asked Madras what action, if any, they propose, and what the effect of this speech has been on the Moplahs. The boycott of schools does not appear to make appreciable progress, and those national schools which have been established are nowhere flourishing, Three cases of incendiarism have been reported from Ganjam, which are said to be connected with the non-ooperation movement.Section 3. Madras-The Mahajana Sabha resolved by the large majority of 70 against 27 to accept the Nagpur congress creed. Information received indicates that GandhPs visit to the presidency has led to an immediate increase in the numbers of the non-co-operative party.Section 4. Punjab. The Sikh situation continues to cause anxiety, but some improvement has been effected partly by the expectation of a favourable issue to the Gurdwaras Bill, and partly by the action taken against certain offenders. The Sikhs are watching the progress of the Bill, which has been welcomed by moderate Sikh opinion, which is, however, timid and non-vocal. The Bill is condemned by the Sikh press and the extremists, and heartily disliked by the Hindus. The Akalis are displaying considerable activity in the Amritsar district; the movement is becoming more, and more a political and less a reforming one, and is now almost entirely directed by avowed non-co-operators. There have been three convictions at Amritsar for seditious speaking. Hartal on 6th April was complete in some places ; elsewhere there was either no hartal at all or only partial. The hartal of the 13th was more complete, but the people in general are beginning to get tired of them. The emissaries of the non-co-operation party continue to show considerable activity in. touring the rural tracts in order to spread the gospel among the villagers. It is thought possible that the non-co-operators may slacken pace owing to a general desire to give the new Viceroy a chance of studying the situation and making a declaration of policy. Three Hindu bankers of Amritsar refused to pay income tax, but were promptly arrested and paid up next day. From Ferozepore considerable bitterness is reported among the demobilized soldiers at having to leave the army.Bengal.--Non-eo-operation is marking time. Hartal on 6th April. was only partially successful, but on the 13th fairly complete. No disturbance has been reported.Section 5. P. C. Milter, Educational Minister, presiding over the Moderate conference at Calcutta in regard to non-co-operation, said that he had no quarrel with the constructito side, or even with the assertive national aspect movement, but condemned emphatically its destructive side, which was. creating a sense of distrust among the people, undermining discipline and - respect for law and order and even parental, authority. He appealed to the delegates to concentrate on constructive work for the next few years. The Bengal provincial congress committee has declared, in view of the attitude of the Government, disclosed through the moderate reforms conference, that the boycott oE the municipalities and district boards should now cease.Section 6. There is a danger in various provinces of the non-co-operation party capturing the municipalities, and using this means to prosecute their educational campaign.27-4 B
Section 7. The Marwari social conference resolved to urge the suspension of practice by lawyers and to support the introduction of the spinning wheel. Thirty-live prisoners escaped from Serajgung sub-jail, but six were re-arrested.United Provinces. At the All-India caliphate conference held at Meerut, the prevailing note was that the caliphate question had to be settled in India itself, swaraj alone could solve the problem. Indian Moslems should concentrate their energies on winning the freedom of India; then the liberation of the holy places and the maintenance of the caliphate would follow as a natural course. Moulvi Syed Ayub Ahmed Saber has been arrested under sections 12-1a and 153a. An important meeting of shiahs at Luoknow decided that it was most necessary to send a deputation to Mesopotamia to investigate fully the alleged bombardment of Najef by British troops.Section 8. The civil commissioner had already promised facilities in case any deputation was sent.Delhi.-Little excitement during the fortnight. No hartal on the 5th or the 6th; on the 13th indifferently successful hartal was observed without any attempt at disturbance.. Section 9. The shopkeeper class is beginning at last to organize au opposition to,these constant hartals.   A temperance movement has started among the sweepers..Section 10. North-West Frontier Province.-There has been considerable increase in activity amongst the disloyal elements in every district. Six persons have been ordered to find security for good behaviour.Section II. This has had an excellent effect in Bannu, and the only symptom of continued agitation is the resignation of a number of lambardars owing to inflarn-matory speeches at Kohat. Orders under the Criminal Procedure Code have been issued to four men not to move beyond one mile from Kutcherry and to refrain from making public speeches for two months. Some recrudescence of the caliphate agitation has also been reported from Mansehra in Hazara district. On the other hand the moderate and loyal elements have emphasized their loyal feelings in addresses to the new chief commissioner, expressing attachment to the Government, and their desire to co-operate in all measures deemed necessary for dealing with the present situation. The visit of members of the Legislative Assembly is said to have had excellent results. There was almost complete hartal in Peshawar city on the loth, but it was very partially observed in other places. The Bombay section of peasants and landholders is reported to be resorting to satyagraha as a protest against the Tata Muishi tank scheme. Swami Cfovindananda, a leading non-co-operatpr at Karachi, has been arrested under sections 124a and 153a ; the collector at Karachi has issued a notification forbidding the carrying of sticks and the public utterances of cries, songs, harangues likely to inflame hostility between, different classes, and assuring the citizens of full protection in the exercise of their lawful occupation. Non-co-operators are standing at the Karachi municipal elections. At one polling-station some non-co-operators had a fracas with the officials on the ground that the latter were influencing the voting. The non-co-operators also threatened to obstruct the passage of voters at the entrance, and a police guard was eventually posted to preserve order.Section 12. Bombay. The Government lias issued, orders that all messages relating to the non-co-operation movement brought for transmission or received by any telegraph office within the municipal limits of Almiadabad, shall be intercepted and forwarded for disposal to the collector or his personal assistant.Section 13. A Central Provinces committee, consisting of an additional judicial commissioner and two others, haj been appointed to enquire into the circumstances under which firing was resorted to at Nagpur on the 28th March. The Central Provinces provincial congress committee also resolved to appoint a committee to inquire into this firing, and decided to ask the public to boycott the committee appointed by the Government. Hartal was fairly general both on the 6th and the 13th. The temperance movement is gathering strength, and Gandhi is persisting that the Governments attitude is anti-temperance.Section 14.   The non-co-operation leaders are concentrating on the more efficient organization of the rural, areas, and committees are being formed in the villages.General. The general situation remains unchanged. While in some respects there are signs of some improvement, e.g., in the Punjab, it requires delicate handling,
rand it is difficult to forecast events in. May and June, or how it may turn out in the-event of a bad monsoon. At the main centres there was fairly complete hartal on the 13th with an entire absence of disturbance. Raza All, a barrister in the United Provinces, appealed to Gandhi to suspend the non-co-operation movement for two months, in order to give the new Viceroy a chance of. estimating the situation for himself, and indicating violence as the inevitable result of the present policy ; but he met with no response, Gandhi replying that the national movement could, not be-suspended to give the Viceroy the opportunity desired, and that if violence did result it would be due to the satanic Government and bad handling by the Government-officials, for which the non-co-operation movement could not be held responsible. The lesser leaders are openly advocating violence and demanding immediate swaraj. Further attempts will be made to win over the police and the army, but so far little success has been achieved in this direction.   The loyalty of the police seems unshaken,-and we are taking earnest measures to combat the spread of discontent in the army. The more vigorous action in the direction of prosecution under the ordinary law seems to be having good effect, but the frontier situation and the Afghan negotiations give cause for some anxiety.   Information from a secret source mentions the names-of four alleged Bolshevik agents in India. Possibly these names are given as Bolsheviks merely because they are prominent men, since there is no evidence showing any connexion between them and the Bolsheviks. While, therefore, there is no immediate cause for special anxiety, there are several possible sources of trouble. Meantime we are following the policy already laid down, carefully watching every -development in the situation.THE DOMINIONS.The Proposed International Court [B.E.R., xli, p. 10]. On 19th April the following telegram was sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada and New Zealand and to the Governor of Newfound-land :-tIis Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to learn, the views of your Government as regards the ratification of the protocol, drawn up in connexion with the statute for a permanent court of international justice.So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, Plis Majesty&apos;s Government have decided on the ratification of the protocol, and propose to adopt the course of ratification by Ills Majesty.   It is hoped that your Ministers will agree to ratification.AUSTRALIA.Frail [B.E.R., xli, p. 11].-On .16th April the Secretary of State for the -Colonies telegraphed as follows in reply to the Governor-GeneraPs telegram, of 11th April :-The Sydney shipping committee have again been consulted and state (1) that the suggestion to hold back butter came too late to be of any use to Western Australia ; (2) that the space in the Essex, which replaced the Northumberland, for Western Australia is equivalent to the 65,000 cases of fruit tendered ; but Western Australia is unable to guarantee more than 59,000 cases, and rather than risk the payment of dead freight they have accepted the suggestion to fill the difference at Sydney ; (3) owing to the curtailment of meat shipments from Australia the refrigerated space is sufficient to absorb all the refrigerated cargo offering, including fruit and butter. In view of these facts the postponement oE the shipment of butter appears to be unnecessary. The Northumberland is loading 148,000 cases of fruit at liobart and the balance space with butter and cheese at Brisbane.The Constitutional Position. The .Prime Minister on 8th April 1921 addressed the House of Representatives, regarding the questions to be discussed at the con-ference of Prime Ministers of the Empire in June, saying in regard to constitutional -changes :. &quot; Recently the question of constitutional changes in the relations between the Dominions and Great Britain has been discussed in the press and on the platform, and I have been criticized for not disclosing my views in regard thereto. There seems to be an impression amongst certain gentlemen . . . . that the forthcoming conference is called to consider and to effect some great constitutional changes. These critics 27-4 C
protested against the Australian representative; being armed with plenary powers-without giving Parliament an opportunity of approving or disagreeing with ray views.&quot; &quot;&apos;.&quot;.--.&apos;.The conference, Mr. Hughes continued, &quot; is not called even to consider cpnstitu-tioual changes.&quot;   These were&quot;-to&apos; be dealt with at a subsequent conference, which might be held next year at the earliest, but probably at a later date.It was painfully evident from articles in &quot;the press, &amp;c, that Ufa certain type of mind the constitution of the British&quot; .Empi rewas &quot;far from what if should be. One object -of these enthusiastic but inexperienced persons was to redraft the Empire-constitution-. When challenged they &quot;repudiated the desire to establish some kind ,of imperial parliament. They wanted to gild the pill. . Falling short of a grandiose&apos; imperial scheme, they hinted at a central council endowed with powers over the various parts of the Empire; They failed to realize that a thousand formulas or imperial councils would not keep the etapire together if either Great Britain or the-various Dominions desired to drift apart.The British Empire was   not built; according - to plan.   Philosophers  and!, constitutionalists, happily for mankind, had no hand in its structure or development.. It was not the result of a deliberate&quot; purpose.   It had grown up, as it were, haphazard, and there never was a time when its structure was crystallized. . It was now, as it. always had been, in a state of flux.That the Dominions should enjoy what to all practical purposes amounted to-independence and self-government, and yet, while boasting of their independence, passionately insist that they were parts of an Empire, one and indivisible, appeared to the foreigner both illogical and inconsistent. &quot; I think,&quot; added Mr. Hughes, &quot; nothing is more certain than, that the surest way of destroying this mighty empire,, one of the chief bulwarks of civilization, is to tamper with its constitution. Com-plete autonomy of the parts is the foundation, upon which its unity rests. Neither-Great Britain nor the Dominions are prepared to yield one jot or tittle with regard to their perfect freedom to govern themselves in their own way, and this assurance of perfect freedom of each of several parts ensures a spiritual unity which, binds us together.&quot;[The above paragraphs&quot; have been taken from the &quot;Journal of the Parliaments of the Empire &quot; by the kind permission of the Editor.]The following news has been received by the High Commissioner for Australia by telegraph : Tlie Imperial (Jonference.--(d) In a debate in the House of Representatives on &quot;the.Imperial Conference, Mr. Tudor, leader of the Opposition, said that should the-White Australia policy lie maintained and nothing be done to create a division between Australia and the United States, an extension of the Anglo-Japanese treaty would meet the desire of the majority of Australians.Mr. Hughes, concluding the debate, said : &quot;I have said repeatedly that the chief problem before Great Britain is to draw up a treaty which will not involve us or Britain in a struggle with the people of the Dinted States. The hope of the world depends-upon some sort of understanding&apos; between America- and the Empire, and it is to find a way to realize that hope that the minds of those attending the imperial conference-should be directed.. It is unthinkable, and not within the bounds of possibility, that we should ever take part in a struggle against America. We cannot be bound by any treaty which we do not ourselves ratify, although the practical consequences of war between Britain and America, whether Japan was or was not her ally, would, of&quot; course^ have to be faced by us. But even if this treaty be renewed, it will not bind Australia to go to war with any country in the world. The last thing that any British Government would think of would be war with the only.nation which, with ourselves,, could hope to maintain the peace of the world. An&apos; understanding with America is essential, and we cannot afford to quarrel with Japan. Australia, however, must stand by her own ideals.&quot;Mr. Hughes promised that no defence scheme or expenditure would be incurred or pledged. Everything would be brought to this Parliament. He felt that he knew the opinion, of Parliament, and he proposed to try to enshrine that opinion in the treaty..(6) The Prime Minister, prior to ins departure for the Imperial Conference, had an enthusiastic ovation at Bendigo, the centre of his constituency. Mr. Hughes, in a lengthy address, said that previously Great Britain had decided the foreign policy of the Empire. While the Dominions were in their swaddling clothes, their pircumstances as well as their remoteness made consultation impossible.
There appeared to be a doubt in the minds of some people how Australia now stood in view of the higher status given to her, and how it was compatible with membership of the Empire and the integrity of the Empire. Australia was inde-pendent, with fall powers of self-government. The relations of the Dominions to the United Kingdom was that of a grown-up son to his mother. No longer tied to his mothers apron-strings, he might stay out late at night, and he might throw his boots about the house, but let anyone say anything against, his mother ami there &apos;wa,s trouble. A solemn responsibility rested upon civilized nations, upon the Empire, America and Japan. They must not let slip the dogs of war until every means had been fried to prevent war. It was suggested in some quarters that war might arise owing to the controversy about Yap. It would be a disgrace to civilization should such a thing happen.   Other means than war should settle such a question.The question to be decided at the Imperial Conference is not whether Australia should do her share, but what that share would be. That was determined to a large extent by the prospects of peace and the possibilities of war. A satisfactory alliance between Great Britain and Japan that would be extended to America would mean to Australia an annual saving of millions sterling.Mr. Hughes.and Japan. The Japanese acting consul-general in Sydney, inter-viewed by the press, has endorsed the statements in Baron IlayashPs comments, upon Mr. Hughes&apos; speech, and said that the speech would be welcomed not only in Japan, but by all lovers of. peace throughout the world.Expenditure on the League of Nations. The Federal Treasurer has informed the Australian House of Representatives that the total approximate expenditure of the Commonwealth to the League of Nations, from its starting to the end of the present financial year, is 68,580/. &apos;Cotton-growing in Queensland. The encouragement of cotton-growing in Queensland is beginning to produce good results. Comparatively large cotton crops are assured for this season. The Queensland State Agricultural Department supplies the farmers with seed and advances b\d. per pound for cotton. It is estimated there will be about 250 tons of seed available after treatment of the present crop. -Oil-boring in Papua. Reports from Papua on boring for oil are encouraging. Good gas and oil &quot; shows &quot; have been found.NEW ZEALAND.The Prime Minister. On 17th April the Governor-General reported that the Prime Minister had left for England on the previous day, and that during his absence Sir Francis Bell would be the acting Prime Minister.The Imperial Conference, On 21st April, the Governor-General telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as follows :-My Prime Minister considers that the subjects enumerated in your telegram of 26th February [B.E.I.L, xxxviii, p. 1.1 j are,those which are considered by him as of main, importance. But (I) the present condominium control of the New Hebrides and (2) improved inter-imperial shipping communication are additional subjects which he would like to submit for discussion.SOUTH AFRICA.The Budget. The Governor-General sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 16th April:  The Budget was introduced yesterday: we anticipate a deficit of approximately 6,500,000/., of which some 4,000,000/. are to be met by reductions and expedients, and 2,500,000/. by new taxation. The expedients include the gradual extinction during the year of the cost of living allowance to public servants, appropriation of the 1919-20 surplus, and receipts from die sale of crown lands. The new taxation is as follows: (1) Postage. Letters within South Africa increased to 2d. per ounce, newspapers in bulk \d. for four ounces.. (2) Stamp duty increased on brokers&apos; notes, new scrip issues, duplicate notarial documents and receipts, overseas insurance companies&apos; interim policies ; bioscope films to pay 20 per cent, ad valorem instead of according to length. (3) Customs and excise. Duty on imported spirits increased from 30s. a proof gallon to 35s., and per liquid gallon 25s. 6ci. to 29s. 9c?. ; on Union spirits an increase of 2s. 6c/-. per proof gallon all round.   On beer an increase of 2d.
per gallon on standard gravity-beer, and Id. per gallon on tickey. beer. - The wheat and flour duties are to be reimposed. On tobacco and cigarettes an excise duty of Is. per lb. on manufactured tobacco in the Union, and 2s. tic?, on cigars.

ReuteFs agent telegraphed as follows from Capetown on 16th April: The Governor-G-eneraPs tour in connexion with the 1820 British settlers&apos; commemoration has. been a brilliant success from beginning to end. Neither the unseasonable rains and the heavy roads nor the impassable drifts made the slightest difference to the enormous popular gatherings. Enthusiasm and ingenuity overcame every difficulty, From the meeting in the rain at Port Elizabeth, where 30,000 people were present, to the brilliant reception in East London last night, Prince and Princess Arthur have been acclaimed, as friends, and there have been everywhere, expressions of loyalty to his Majesty the King. At the towns in the old battlefield area and at the coast, monuments are being erected ; but everywhere it is agreed that the best memorial would be for London to send more British settlers to intermingle with the descendants of the .1820 Londoners of the ships Chapman, Nautilus, &amp;c, and for Bristol, Portsmouth, Liverpool, Cork, and other cities to do the same under the aegis of the &quot; 1820 Settlers&apos; Memorial Association.&quot;The Mozambique Convention.

The Minister added that the advisability and possibility of: this joint action had been further discussed during the recent visit of the Union custodian, Sir Hamilton Fowle, to London. The Minister said that no decision had yet been arrived at, and the matter was still under consideration.

ReuteFs Capetown agent reported.on 19th April, that Mr. Ma I an, the Minister for Mines and Industries, had been present, at a dinner given that day in connexion with the arrival of the S.S.

In South Africa they did not mind with whom they dealt provided it benefit-ted them, but other things being equal they preferred to deal with those speaking their own language. The birth of this company was the realization of an old ideal, and he trusted that the direct service between Holland and&apos; South Africa would be of benefit to both countries. He concluded by wishing the company every success.
