GREAT BRITAIN.Unemployment Situation. The following summary of the situation is taken from the special report on unemployment for the week ending 4th August, issued by the Ministry of LabourSome slight improvement in the engineering industry is reported from -the Midlands and North-Eastern Divisions, although generally there would appear to be no material change for the better. Jn the iron and steel industry there is a further slight improvement in the Midlands, but unemployment in the industry has increased in the North-Eastern Division. The improvement previously reported in Wales is. not likely to be great for many months to come. Coal mining remains at a very low ebb, although some increased activity is reported - from certain centres, notably the North-Eastern Division, in consequence of the present demand for British coal in the United States.   A small improvement is reported in the Midlands Division.There is no material change in the position of the shipbuilding industry generally, but slightly increased activity is apparent in the North-Eastern Division. Improve-ment in the woollen and worsted industry is maintained, especially in the North-Eastern Division. Employment in the cotton and textile industry remains good in Scotland, but in the North-Western Division the outlook at present, except in the fine spinning section of the industry, is not so good as was expected.Some slight improvement in the building trade is shown in the South-Western Division, but great depression is still maintained generally. - Employment in the confectionery-stationery trade in the North-Eastern Division is very good. A general slump is, however, reported in the clothing trade. Increased unemployment in the brick and cement trade is reported from the South-Western Division and in the London Division. In the South-Western Division there is an improvement in the boot and shoe industry, which also continues fairly steady in the Midlands.Unemployment has increased in the glass trade in the North-Eastern Division, The tinplate trade in South Wales has shown some slight improvement, but the copper and spelter industry in that Division still remains at a very low ebb. A great improvement in the fishing industry is reported from the Stornoway District, where all the curers are working fully staffed. In the rubber, hatting and slipper manufac-turing trades in the North-Western Division, all the workpeople are fully employed. The lace trade in the South-Westefn Division is in a very precarious state, and further discharges are expected. The position of this industry in the Midlands Division is, however, slightly better.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.   .Appointment of Governors. On 14th August the Colonial Office announced theappointment of four new G ovcrnors, as follows : Sir Robert Coryndon      - Kenya.Sir Geoffrey Archer        - Uganda.Lieut-Col. G. H. Summers -                                Somalilancl.Sir Graeme Thomson ...   British Guiana.INDIA.The Fortnightly Report, The following official message on events during the fortnight ended 4th August has been received from India: Maduas. The Governor has been received -with enthusiasm everywhere in his tour, and particularly in Gtmtur, where the District Magistrate reports a real revulsion of feeling in favour of peace and quietness. The Andhra Provincial Congress Committee seems to have decided that civil disobedience is not a practical proposition at present. The Caliphate movement in Madras is in low water pecuniarily. Bakar Musaliar, one of the two remaining leaders of Moplahs in the field, has been arrested. His capture may be regarded as practically marking the close of the rebellion. There is no lack of employment in Malabar except in Calicut Taluk (sub-district). The area cultivated up to the end of -June in talnkas affected by the rebellion is greater than in the corresponding period in 1921.
Bombay. The Sukkur Provincial Caliphate Conference ended quietly and on a note of hope rather than of hatred. This, was mainly due to the leadership of Mr. Pickthall (of the Bombay Chronicle). A resolution, however, was passed confirming the resolution passed by the Central Caliphate Committee that civil disobedience was unavoidable, and provincial organizations should, therefore, use every endeavour to complete a constructive programme. Much disapproval is expressed by Deccan Nationalists over the personnel of the Civil Disobedience Committee and its decision to hold proceedings in camera. This committee was appointed by a congress committee at Lncknow to tour India with the professed object of ascertaining whether the country was ripe for civil disobedience.It is doubtful whether the visit of the committee to the presidency has had any stimulating effects. There are indications that a strike among the employees of the Tramway Company will shortly materialize, mainly on the question of recognition of the Tramway Employees Union. The employees will probably gain a large measure of popular support. Jayakar, a leading member of the non-co-operation party, has resumed practice as a lawyer. Deccan nationalists are divided over the question of entering provincial Legislative Councils and individual independent action. Seven mills in Bombay ceased to work on 1st August, in connexion with Tilak&apos;s death anniversary. There was some stone throwing, but all is now quiet and the men were expected to resume work to-morrow (5th August).Bengal. There has, according to press telegrams, been some revival of picketing in Calcutta and Barisal, and some arrests have been made, but so far the picketing has not been general, or on a large scale. The quarrel between the Calcutta and Bengal Provincial Caliphate Committees continues. The difficulties experienced by punitive police in Tipperah have been overcome and this area appears to be coining to its senses. In Chittagong district a small body of police that was present to enforce an order of the. District Magistrate for the cutting of an embankment, in accordance -with a civil court decree, was attacked by a crowd, apparently instigated by volunteers. The police had to open lire, killing one and wounding four of the rioters. The firing-appears to have been inevitable. There have been live bhadralog (middle-class) dacoities so far, in which volunteers appear to have been suspected. Two men, against whom proceedings under section 109 of the Criminal Procedure Code have been taken, are known to have been members of the local branch of the Anusilail Samiti, aud were concerned in dacoities by revolutionaries in 1917. As regards the general situation, it is unlikely that any important steps wdll be taken by disaffected pending the findings of the Civil Disobedience Enquiry Committee, but the activities of ex-revolutionaries are becoming noticeable. It is reported in the press that Sen Gupta, a local leader, and some other pleaders have taken up their practice again.United Provinces. Attempts of revival of agitation continue, but success as before is still uncertain. Gorakpur district reports a renewal of non-co-operation propaganda as a result of Malaviya&apos;s visit. A pamphlet issued by Motilal Nehru encourages non-co-operators to contest municipalities and district boards at the next elections.-Aligarh had a big meeting on anniversary of the riots there. The population is described as being in a sullen mood. Parrukhabad and Etawah districts show signs of renewed restlessness. Such information as is forthcoming represents witnesses giving evidence before the congress committee (which recently sat at Lucknow) as generally against civil disobedience. No arrest has yet been effected iu the Bareilly shooting case. Agra and Jhansi divisions, where dacoity is common, record no dacoities during the fortnight.   Gunner Eaton has been found guilty by a jury of the&apos; murder of a chowkidar (village watchman) and. sentenced to death by the High Court, Allahabad.Bihak am) OiussA. The political situation remains unaltered. Mazharul Haque, proprietor and editor of Motherland, prosecuted by the Inspector-General of Prisons under section 500, Indian Penal Code, has gone to jail in default of payment of line. In Orissa, the conviction of three of the leaders of the non-co-operation movement has had an excellent effect. An attempted demonstration by way of welcome to released political prisoners fell flat. On the occasion of Path Jatra festival, there was no sign of. any sympathy with the non-co-operation movement; only two Gandhi caps were noticed. Volunteers from Balasore were unable to dispose of more than Rs. 300 worth of khaddar (native hand-woven cloth). In Tirhoot all is quiet. The idea of another strike on the East Indian Railway is reported to be in abeyance for the time being.Punjab. Non-co-operators appear to be awaiting the report of the Civil Dis-obedience Committee; meanwhile the lull continues.   There is a widespread belief
that large amounts have been misappropriated from caliphate funds, and much mutual recrimination. Hindu-mohamedan unity has little or no existence, aud the final estrangement of the two communities is being hastened by controversy over.affairs in Malabar. There has been no interference with the sale of foreign cloth, but, liquojr shops at Pindi and Jhelmn have been picketed. The Punjab Government have dropped the Gurdwara Bill, in view of the attitude of the Sikhs. The editors of the. Bqnde Mataram and Akali have been convicted under section 124a, Indian Penal Code. The prosecution of the editor, printer and publisher of Pardeslii KhdUa has been sanctioned, and civil suits have been lodged against this paper, as also against the Gargaj Akali.,Central Provinces. The Provincial Congress Committee, giving evidence before the Civil Disobedience Enquiry Committee, favoured civil disobedience against section 144, Criminal Procedure Code. The Congress Committee expressed fhem-selves as disappointed with the progress made in the Central Provinces. It is understood that the bulk of the evidence, of Marhatta leaders was against the early introduction of civil disobedience, while the Ashyog Ashram party (Gandhi-ites) pressed for immediate action, but were compelled to make damaging admissions regarding the extent of preparation and. training. The struggle between the Tilak and Gandhi factions continues. Action under the preventive section of the Criminal Procedure Code continues to be taken against a few of the more violent agitators.Assam.-The fortnight has been practically without incident. There has been a little opposition in Sylhet to the collection of the cost of additional police, but this has been successfully met. The Commissioner of Assam Valley reports that the division is still peaceful and agitation dormant.Burma. The question of the boycott of the Legislative Council was to have been decided at a meeting of the General Council of the Burmese Association. The responsible leaders at the meeting spoke strongly in favour of- going into the Council. A compromise resolution, that the General Council should capture as many seats as possible, and that participation or non-participation should be decided in the November session, was put and received with loud applause, and declared carried, but the meeting was then declared out of order by li. AYeponla, and great disorder ensued. It is not clear whether a ballot was taken or not. There is, there-fore, some hope now that the General Council of the Burmese Association machinery will be captured by those in, favour of going into Council, and the indications are that the rank and file are beginning to swing round to the moderate side.Delhi. It is now believed that, in accordance with the expressed wish, of one of the leading members of the committee, witnesses supported individual action, but declared Delhi to be quite unprepared for mass civil disobedience. The editor of The Congress has been sentenced to three years&apos; rigorous imprisonment, /under section 124a. The congress newspaper ceased publication owing to lack of funds, but a former paper, Swuvdjya, has been resuscitated.North-West Frontier Province. There is little political activity to report, Caliphate volunteers visiting villages in theKohat district are not being received with enthusiasm. Two Sikh sepoys have been court-martialled for disobedience of a regimental order, in regard to wearing of black pagris and kirpans, and sentenced to five years&apos; rigorous imprisonment. They have approached the superintendent of the jail about appealing for mercy against their sentence. Bitter animosity has been displayed between hindus and mohamedans over a scheme of city extension at Bannu. On 15th duly and two or three following days, there was a sudden recrudescence of caliphate volunteers ; four or five leading men were arrested and the situation is now quiet.General. There is still nothing to indicate that the congress of the Civil Disobedience Enquiry Committee is making any serious impression. . It appears to be generally anticipated that they will report in favour of postponement of civil disobedience. There are indications of increased activity on the part of non-co-operators, but so far there are no serious developments.
THE DOMINIONS,NEW ZEALAND.Assembly of the League of Notions.-On 5th August the Governor-General transmitted the following request to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : Please advise the Secretary-General of the League of Nations that the Honourable Sir Francis Bell has been appointed an additional delegate and representative of New Zealand at the third Assembly of the League.SOUTH AFRICA.The following items of information were telegraphed by ReuteFs agents :  The Mandate for South-West Africa. Prince Arthur of Connaught, who is at present touring the South-West Protectorate, arrived at Rehoboth on Sunday, where lie was received by van Wyk, the captain of the Bastard tribe, and councillors.Plis Royal Highness proceeded to tbe native town, where, in reply to a loyal address, be explained to the natives their position under the mandate, pointing out that the Union had full administrative and legislative power over Rehoboth, similarly to other parts of the Protectorate. Pie emphasized that the Union under the mandate must observe certain definite provisions, beyond which they must exercise their own discretion. But while the Union had full power and authority over Rehoboth, it was their declared policy to leave a measure of self-government to the Rehoboth community, through their council and captain, in connexion with which they should approach the Administrator, who was actuated by every desire to come to a fair arrangement in regard to details.   [Capetown, 31st July.]Rhodesia and the Union. The principal terms for the entrance of Southern Rhodesia into the Union are as follows: Southern Rhodesia will be the fifth province of the Union and will be known as Rhodesia. English and Dutch will be the official languages and will enjoy equal rights. Rhodesia will send 10 representatives to the House of Assembly, but provision is made for increasing this number to 17 as the population of the new province increases. Rhodesia will at first have four elected and one nominated Senators, but provision is made for an ultimate representation&apos; iu the Senate of eight elected and two nominated members. The Provincial Council wall consist of 20 members and will be similar to the councils of the other provinces comprised in the Union.In addition to the usual provincial subsidy, Rhodesia is to get a special subsidy of 50,0001. a year for 10 years as compensation for the abolition of the Rhodes Clause. The Union taxation system will apply, but for a period of three years income-tax exemption as at present granted in Southern Rhodesia will remain in force. A development grant of not less than 500,0001. a year for 10 years is to be devoted to-capital expenditure on development such as railways, public works, irrigation, land settlements, telegraphs, roads, bridges, and other development purposes. The Rhodesia and Mashonaland railways are to be taken over and also the other railway rights of the Chartered Company. The Union rates and fares will be charged throughout Rhodesia. Special attention will be devoted to the port of Beira as the-principal outlet for Rhodesian traffic.Crown lauds will be freed at once of charges in respect of the debt clue to the Chartered Company, and a Laud Settlement Board consisting of Rhodesians will be appointed, the funds for which will come out of the development grant. The mineral rights of the Chartered Company will be acquired by a mutual agreement with the Company at a later date.. In the meantime, the present royalties will continue to be paid to the Company. The Rhodesian mining law and regulations will continue in force after the incorporation of the province in the Union.The public service will become part of the Union service. All its existing and accruing rights will be secured and additional rights and assurances as to the future will also be granted. The same provision applies to the Chartered police and railway v servants.The existing defence system will continue until there has been time to consider how best to apply the Union system.   There will be no restriction on the movement 43-3        , B
of Europeans as between Rhodesia and the other provinces of the Union. With regard to the movements of other than Europeans, the existing restrictions in force in the Union will apply. - No recruiting.in Rhodesia of labour for other parts of the Union will be allowed. The existing municipalities will get as a free endowment the transfer of land set aside for them, as commonages.,Note. The so-called &quot; Rhodes Clause &quot; referred to above is contained in the Southern Rhodesia Customs Amendment Order in Council, 1914, and is as follows: &quot; No customs duties levied on any articles other than tobacco in any form and intoxicating liquors of any kind, produced or manufactured in any part of His Majesty s Dominions or in any British Protectorate and imported into Southern Rhodesia shall exceed in amount the duties levied on similar articles from overseas according to the tariff in force in the South Africa Customs Union at the date of coming into operation of the Principal Order or the tariff contained in the Customs Union Convention concluded between the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, the Orange Free State and Natal in May 1898 whichever are the higher.&quot; [Capetown, 1st August,.]&apos;Nationalist Parly&apos;s 1&apos;rotest.r-The executive of the Nationalist Party which is meeting here passed a resolution to-day protesting against the Governments &quot; arbitrary and unconstitutional attitude in not consulting the people of the Union with reference to the incorporation of Southern Rhodesia,&quot; and alleging that the terms of the incorporation show that the Government is not concerned with the Unioits interest, that the parliamentary representation offered to Rhodesia is excessive and unfair to the existing provinces, and that the incorporation will impose an unjust, financial burden upon the Union taxpayers.   [Bloemfonteiu, lUth August.]Speech by General Smuts.  General Smuts, accompanied by Mrs. Smuts aud Sir William Ploy, the general manager of railways and harbours, is on a visit to Rhodesia, and is at present the guest of the Administrator at Government House.Replying to the toast in his honour at the mayoral banquet, which was drunk with the heartiest enthusiasm, General Smuts said : &quot; Rhodesiaus are entitled to all the information possible before making their very momentous decision at the forthcoming referendum.&quot; lie then proceeded to give a very full and lucid account of the Union Governments negotiations, first with the Rhodesian delegation, second with the Chartered Company, and finally with the Imperial Government. Be stated that the Union Government had pushed on these to the utmost, but the publication of the terms had been delayed owing to the necessity of coming to a settlement with the Imperial Government regarding Rhodesia&apos;s war debt of 2,000,000/. Incidentally, the Premier paid a warm tribute to the assistance received from the anti-Union members of the delegation, and to the Chartered Company&apos;s record in administering the country. The Union Government had done all that was possible to clarify the position and to help the Rhodesians, who would probably hold a referendum before the end of October, and their choice would be left entirely to their own discretion. The Union Government would have no complaint if they decided to establish responsible government instead of joining up with the Union.General Smuts then pointed out that as long ago as 1908 the representatives of the four Colonies, in resolving upon the Union, added that Rhodesia should have the right of entering it, and provision for its inclusion was made in the South African,, Act which followed. General Smuts further pointed out that the only criticism passed upon the Union Government was to the effect that the Chartered Company had got the better of it, but there was none regarding the terms to the Rhodesians. He had no doubt of the Union. Parliaments approval if the Rhodesians made up their minds to enter the Union.In the course of an elequent reference to the founder of Rhodesia, General Smuts said that Cecil Rhodes was the first statesman to recognize clearly the impossibility of either British or Dutch domination in South Africa, but that the co-operation of both was essential, lie made a great mistake through his impatience, but his speech at Capetown in October .1900 showed clearly that he had discovered his error when, he emphasized that the Dutch must be made to feel that the bitterness was over, and the need for co-operation greater than ever. The realization of Rhodes&apos; ideal had at , length been attained, and the followers of Kruger and Rhodes were trying together to forge out the destiny of the white face in South Africa which would perhaps be greater than Kruger and Rhodes ever foresaw.
General Smuts concluded by stating that the people of the Union would always regard the Rhodesians as brothers of the same blood, brothers whether in the family of- the Union or brothers next door. .    .The Premiers speech was repeatedly cheered and at the close he received an ovation which lasted for some minutes.   [Buluwayo, 6th August.]The Future of Rhodesia,. Speaking at Salisbury, General Smuts, the Union Prime Minister, emphasized the striking advance made by Rhodesia along all the lines of agricultural progress. He was filled with joy that Rhodesia, the youngest South African community and the youngest State which had arisen in the group of States which colonized and inhabited South Africa, had made such wonderful progress, and remarked that he had seen a development in tobacco-growing which he regarded as perfectly astounding.After laying stress on the point that it was the small, settler that ultimately made the. population and that there was a chance for him. General Smuts said he was convinced that there could be a tremendous development in tobacco culture and that Rhodesia could become one of the chief producers of high-class tobacco in the Empire. Indeed the position which to-day was occupied in the British market by foreign producers could be occupied to a very large and substantial extent by Rhodesia and by the small farmers of Rhodesia. lie reiterated that it was the small farmer who was going to make success, and declared that he would not be surprised to see Rhodesia become one of the best and foremost agricultural producers, not only of the British Empire, but of the world. Pie then dealt with the potentialities of the stock farming . and citrus industries and the need for organization in regard to them, in which work he declared they would receive assistance from the South.   [Capetoum, 12th August.]New Gold Reef. Reports have been received here of the location of a new gold, reef beginning on the borders of Bechuanaland. and extending to the Rustenburg district.NEWFOUNDLAND.Appointment of Governor. On Pith August the Colonial Office announce.! the -appointment of Sir William L. Allardyce as Governor of Newfoundland.
