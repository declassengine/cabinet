GREAT BRITAIN.The following paragraph is taken from the Weekly Report on Unemployment, for 30th September 1921, issued by the Ministry of Labour: Emergency Works for the Unemployed. At the meeting of the Cabinet held on the 13th August 1920, a special sub-committee was appointed to consider the whole question of unemployment and devise means for relieving it. As a result of their deliberations it was announced that the sum of 10,400,000 . should be set aside for expenditure on arterial roads, half to be expended by way of actual grant, and half by way of loans to the local authorities undertaking the work. In December it was announced that a further sum of 3,000,0001 had been allocated to the unemployment grants committee, which is presided over by Lord St. Davids, for the purpose of assisting local authorities to carry out works on which a substantial amount of the unemployed could be engaged. Further, it was agreed that the Ministry of Health should accelerate the work of laying out roads and sewers in connexion with approved housing schemes. Arrangements were also made for the provision of alternative work in Government establishments, and for short-time working in certain Government establishments. In addition, certain emergency work was undertaken by local authorities without assistance. Approximately 25,000,OOOL has been spent on the schemes outlined above, and at least 200,000 men have from time to time been provided with work by these means.COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.KENYA COLONY.Indian Franchise Question. On 24th September ReuteFs Capetown agent telegraphed as follows : Representatives of the white settlers in the Kenya colony have been visiting the large centres in the Union, and have been everywhere received with the greatest sympathy.   They will shortly visit Nyassaland and Northern Rhodesia.A good sprinkling of South Africans have material interests in the Kenya colony and several prominent professional men are desirous of settling there. They are, however, deterred from doing so by the fact that the question of the Indian franchise there is not settled. The same fact is holding up money which South Africans are prepared to invest in Kenya projects.EGYPT.The Labour Members. On 3rd October Mr. , Scott reported [No. 570] that Zaghloul Pasha had that day cancelled- the arrangements for his visit to Upper Egypt with the Members of Parliament, and had stated in a press communique that this decision was due to the fact that the Members of Parliament had now to leave Egypt on 7th October while he himself was prevented from leaving Cairo owing to the illness of his sister-in-law. Mr. Scott added that if that decision was maintained, it disposed of.any question of prohibiting further visits under martial law.MESOPOTAMIA.. Iraq.T7ie External Situation. On 28th September the High Commissioner of Iraq telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in regard to the external situation, the salient features of,which, he said, seemed-to be the following : (1) By brilliant strategy and grand tactics Mustapha Kemal has crushed the Greek offensive. We may therefore assume that he entirely overshadows Enver Pasha at the moment, and that the predominant note in Anatolian politics is pan-Turanian, and (? therefore) anti-Bolshevik.   At the same time we know that the
Kemalists fear the Bolshevik troops massed on their borders and have retained in -command of their eastern troops their *trusted anti-Bolshevik generals. The strengthening of Erzeronm and the demolition of Kiars are obviously directed against a possible Bolshevik menace. The pan-Turanian policy of Mustapha does not contemplate a Turkification of the Arab provinces, but he himself is persuaded that the strength of the Greeks has been clue to the British, and accordingly he has done his best to damage British interests here. His objection is not to Arab independence but to the British running Iraq. As I understand, the situation-it is not the point of British policy to fall foul of Mustapha unless he falls foul of us; and I have no knowledge of the secret support alleged to have been accorded by us to the Greeks. But I assume it is still the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure if possible a friendly.... (?) on the borders of Iraq. At the present moment when Bolshevik influence in Anatolian politics must be at its weakest, when the fear of Bolshevik aggression is nevertheless ever present, when moreover the rapid spreading influence of Russia in Persian,politics must be a disquieting factor to the Turks, the time appears to be ripe for a further attempt at negotiations with King Feisal to endeavour to open informal negotiations. I am alive to the risk attendant on an attempt which Mustapha will inevitably make to turn King Feisal against the British, but so satisfied do I feel of the King&apos;s loyalty to us that I am convinced it is a risk we can well afford to run. It is impossible to escape the strong suspicion that Mustapha&apos;s negotiations with- the French will have resulted in a further poisoning of his mind against us, and should negotiations with King Feisal be successfully initiated they would serve as a useful antidote. Further, should King Feisal prove successful in the suggested attempt, his prestige will be enormously increased and his throne secured beyond all expectations; for not only would he remove a clanger but he would convert it into a source of strength. I am unaware if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have other and better means of access to Mustapha ; if not, I venture to suggest that I should discuss the problem with King Feisal and convey to him the assurance that His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome his taking steps to initiate negotiation with Mustapha with a view to the formulation of an agreement. That the present moment is one not to be lost I feel very strongly and beg the favour of an early reply.- Telegraphing again [No. 558] on 7th October, Sir Percy Cox reported as follows :  VAt- my last meeting with him, King Feisal drew my attention to a recent Reuter telegram report that Mustapha Kemal was bent on making things hot for him in Mesopotamia. He emphasized the danger of the situation, especially now that apparently the Greeks had suffered a severe defeat and peace overtures were on foot. He asked if I had any recent information as to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Flovernment.I took the opportunity of sounding him as to how he would regard it if Iraq were permitted to exchange views with Mustapha Kemal with a view to a friendly under-standing. I found that he was extraordinariby in favour of the idea on the grounds that the fact of his having a sort of neighbourly understanding as between one Islamic Government and another would strengthen his position greatly in the Mohamedan world generally, and would do much to sterilize the activities of the pro-Turkish elements in Iraq.New Cabinet. The following is taken from The Times of 5th October: It is officially announced that King Feisal having called on the Naqib of Baghdad, President of the Provisional Council of the -State in Iraq, to form a new Cabinet, portfolios have been distributed as follows : -His Highness the Naqib, G.B.E.   - .     - -   Premier.Haji Ahmed Namji -         -        -&apos;       -  Interior.Jafar Pasha al Askari       -         -        -        -  Defence.Sassoon Effendi Plaskail    -         - -  Finance.Naji Bey Ibn Yusuf al Suwaidi    - Justice.Saiyid Mohamed Ah Effencli al Fathli      -:      -   Wakfs.Abdul Latif Pasha Mandil - Commerce.Izzat Pasha -        -        -        -  1 Public Works.-Sheikh Abdul Karim Jazairi        - -        -   Education.Dr. If anna Khaiyat -         -         -        -   Health.
INDIA.Mission to Kabul [B.E.R., liii, p. 3]. On 27th September the Viceroy transmitted [2273 S.] a message from Sir Henry Dobbs reporting that he had had a long private-conference with the Amir at the latter&apos;s request on 25th September. In spite of Sir-Henry^ protest that the exclusive treaty was done with, the Amir insisted on discussing it, and said that he had only been prevented from signing it by the insistence on previous consultation regarding a treaty with third Powers, and that he-was ready to sign an exclusive treaty now if that point were modified. On Sir Henry pointing out the impossibility of this in view of his ratification of a treaty with Russia, the Amir declared that our nttitude regarding treaties with third Powers had driven-him to make the treaty with Russia, but that if we would define the class of question requiring previous consultation, he would cancel the treaty and sign an exclusive-treaty with us subject to certain modifications and alterations which he specified.. The Amir declined to entertain any suggestion of the gentlemanly treaty, and said that if his present proposals were not accepted, it only remained for the mission to-leave without any treaty at all.The Viceroy telegraphed [2278 S.] the continuation of the above message on 29th September. Summarizing the Amir&apos;s remarks, Sir Henry Dobbs reported that the Amir acknowledged the receipt of boxes of gold, but said that he preferred British friendship to Russian gold. He also alleged that Tarsi knew nothing of his present proposal and asked Sir Henry not to mention it to him. -Further, he said that he had no intention of ratifying the Turkish treaty which had been drafted without his-authority. Sir Henry gave his view that the Government was faced with the alternatives of consideration of the Amir&apos;s proposals, which he described as discreditable transactions, and the complete rupture of negotiations. He was in favour of persisting in presenting the gentlemanly treaty and meeting the-consequences.* The Viceroy telegraphed [2292 S.] on 30th September a further message from. Sir Henry Dobbs reporting a second private meeting with the Amir, Nawab being-present as before, at which the Amir had more definitely stated his ideas under the following headings : (1) Repudiation of the treaty with Russia as soon as the rifles,, to be received under the exclusive treaty with the British, could be transported to the Turkestan frontier; six weeks from the date of delivery being suggested. &apos;(2) An undertaking to receive no money or munitions from Russia and to return what had already been received. (3) Liberty to make a fresh neighbourly treaty with Russia if she does not break off all relations in consequence of the repudiation of the present treaty. (4)-Assurance of British support against unprovoked Russian attack, with a. clear statement.of the minimum assistance in money and munitions which the British would be prepared to give. (5) Increase of munitions from 200 to 1,000 rounds per rifle, and 12 aeroplanes instead of six, with delivery as before on the signature of the treaty, but at least four aeroplanes to be delivered immediately. (6) Exclusion of consuls of third Powers, and only one British consulate. (7) Afghan diplomatic representatives to be on the same footing as those of other States regarding matters, relating to India. (8) Certain verbal alterations in clause 1-1- to remove the suggestion that it was directed against. Afghanistan alone. [The continuation of this report was.&apos; telegraphed by the Viceroy on 30th September.] (9) Amendments to clause 15, by which either, Power was to accept ,certain undertakings and obligations concerning their relations with a third Power, and restraining either Government from entering into an offensive alliance against the other.In reply Sir Henry expressed his doubts as to whether the British Government would feel justified in allowing the interval proposed in the first condition ; he did not think the question of a Russian representative at Kabul was sufficiently definite ; he thought it would be impossible to supply four aeroplanes immediately; and he considered the proposals under clause 3 were so much at variance with the views of: His Majesty&apos;s Government as to be likely to extinguish the entire programme.The Amir said that having giving the matter much thought he could not give way on any one of these points.    Sir Henry suggested a gentlemanly treaty in a modified form should these proposals not be accepted, as appeared probable, but the Amii-absolutely refused to consider such an arrangement, and said he must either have a. modified exclusive treaty as indicated or nothing.
Sir Henry was not inclined to question the sincerity of the Amir, and thought that there was a good chance that he would carry out his promises, but be could not believe that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to take the risk of making the concessions involved.The Viceroy reviewed the situation which had arisen in a series of telegrams [2290 S, 2296 S. i, and 2296 S. if], dated 30th September and 1st October, and queried whether there was no middle course if we could not entertain the Amir&apos;s proposals and he would not entertain ours. It appeared to the Government of India that the Amir was anxious to secure a treaty with us, and only rejected the gentlemanly treaty because he would get nothing out of it, and it would establish a bad precedent for future treaties with us. Their view, therefore, was that advantage should be taken of the Amir&apos;s present attitude by prompt action. Sir Henry Dobbs should inform the Amir explicitly that his proposals could not be entertained ; that by his delay and actions he has lost the opportunity of gaining large concessions from us; but, if he would make an immediate and full disclosure of the Russian treaty and its supplement we would give him the final chance of standing in with the one great Power who could assist in the political development of his country, and of having the subsidy granted to his forefathers renewed to himself. The Amir should be allowed seven days only to decide.On 2nd October the Viceroy transmitted [2308 S.] Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; views of the situation as it then appeared to him. After discussing the probability or improbability of different lines of action by the Amir, Sir Henry said that he remained of the same opinion that the safest and most dignified course was to insist on the neighbourly treaty as originally shaped or nothing, and to meet the consequence of its rejection.Sir Henry Dobbs replied to the Viceroy&apos;s telegrams of 30th September in a message transmitted [2313 S.] by the latter on 3rd October. He stated that he held little hope of success for the programme suggested to him, and reommended a course to be pursued on the following lines. He proposed an exchange of notes between Tarsi and himself with mutual regrets at the failure of negotiations to arrive at the basis of a treaty of friendship. Nevertheless, as neither State wished to look upon this as final, an immediate exchange of Ministers was proposed, in the hope that through them, either in London or in Kabul, it would be found possible to devise definite friendly terms. Sir Henry proposed to undertake that the relations of the Afghan Minister in London should be with the Foreign Office only. He also proposed to promise in a separate and confidential letter, free transport, housing and accommodation in London, and certain other amenities for the Afghan Minister and his suite, until a final treaty was settled. lie estimated the cost of this proposition at one lakh of rupees per annum. Commenting on this suggestion, the Viceroy pointed out that its merit was that it would avoid a formal rupture, but that, on the other hand, we should be giving away what the Amir essentially wants, viz., recognition of the complete independence of Afghanistan, and considerable material advantage.In continuation of the foregoing telegram, on 4th October, the &quot;Viceroy added that the Arnawai difficulty would still be left en Vair, and although he was reluctant to differ from Sir Henry, who was on the spot, he still thought that our best tactics would be to present the old treaty of friendship with the subsidy.The Viceroy&apos;s Report. The following telegram was sent on 4th October : -Section 1. Madras. We have kept you fully informed of all important develop-ments in Malabar. Additional troops are about to be sent to that area, including a battalion, of Gurkhas and a Burma battalion trained in hill warfare, a section of armoured cars, and portable wireless sets. The local Government is also raising a force of military police, and we have sanctioned the issue to them of magazine rifles.Section 2, Up to the 22nd September, the summary courts had disposed of the cases of 1,467 persons, of whom 362 were committed to the special tribunal, 942 were sentenced to two years, 4 were acquitted, and the balance sentenced to minor punishments. The majority of the accused were charged with murder, theft and other offences against the ordinary criminal law. The outbreak in Malabar has had a sobering effect on other districts in Madras. The bulk of Hindu opinion is genuinely shocked at the excesses committed by the Moplahs, and the non-co-operation movement is less active in the presidency; for example, the Madura municipality has revoked its decision to present an address of welcome to Gandhi.33-2 B
Section 3. The picketing of liquor shops in Madras is - declining, probably as a result of the prosecution of offenders. The boycott of foreign cloth continues to be a complete failure in the presidency. Among the crowd who attended Gandhi&apos;s meetings in Madras very few wore country cloth.Bengal. The cloth boycott in Calcutta was stimulated by Gandhi&apos;s visit, but the success achieved is less than was expected. The arrest of 46 picketers in the Burra bazaar, Calcutta, on the 16th September, caused the collection of a menacing crowd. No disturbance occurred.   The Assam-Bengal railway strike has collapsed.Bombay.-The high price of foodstuffs is causing some unrest in Sind. The enthusiasm for the boycott of foreign cloth has declined.Central Provinces. The split between the followers of Tilak and Gandhi is becoming more marked. The movement for the boycott of foreign cloth is making little headway ; the non-co-operating-pleaders are gradually resuming practice.Section 4. Punjab. -The distress caused by high prices is a matter of serious concern, but the tour of the Minister and the Financial Commissioner has to some extent restored confidence and removed misunderstandings.Section 5&apos;. The Akali Sikh movement&apos; has been showing more signs of activity, and the release by the local Government of most of those imprisoned for forcible seizure of shrines and similar incidents does not seem to have evoked much gratitude.Section 6.   United Provinces. High prices are causing much uneasiness.Section 7. A large number of meetings have been held in Oudh, and agitators are carrying on a strenuous campaign amongst the cultivators. The campaign is stigmatized as the most dangerous and reckless gamble that the educated party ever played with an ignorant peasantry.Assam. The visit of Gandhi and Mohamed Ali fell rather flat. Gandhi censured the local leaders for the coolie strikes and hartals, and for lukewarmness in the (? European) boycott and the use of spinning-wheels. &apos; Instances are occurring of coolies, who took, part in the exodus of May last, returning to the tea districts, sometimes to the gardens from which they bolted.Section 8. A communication has appeared in the press, purporting to be issued by the Assam-Bengal railway strikers, denouncing the congress agitation for fomenting the strike and then leaving them in the lurch, and also advising the office employees to refuse to follow similar advice. This is noteworthy as indicating the mistrust employer (sic) of political agitators at present.Section 9. General. Muharram passed off quietly everywhere. The arrest of the caliphate leaders naturally caused considerable excitement amongst politically-minded Moslems, but there have been no disturbances.Section 10.    The moderate press generally recognize the justification for a prosecution, while inclined fo deprecate it as a tactical error.   Gandhi, who was in Mohamed Ali&apos;s company when the latter was arrested, has since made a defiant speech at Trichinopoly, endorsing the Karachi resolution which is the subject of the prosecution.   The following is the substance of important passages in the speech:-He expressed regret that he was not present at the Karachi conference ; had he been there, he would have supported the resolution.   Only a moslem could say whether it is a sin for a moslein to serve in the British army.   At the present moment, he as a hindu and as an Indian, knew what was the duty of every hinclu and Indian.   He knew it was a sin for a single Indian to serve either in the British army or in the civil employment of the Government, and if a public declaration of this  character constituted the offence of tampering with the loyalty of soldiers, then Gandhi had committed the offence times without number.   The offence was also committed by the congress in September of last year at Calcutta, and deliberately repeated at Nagpur.   If neither Gandhi nor the congress had hitherto appealed to individual soldiers and Government employees, it was not because of a want of wall, but because of a want of ability.   As soon as the country had assimilated the gospel of the spinning-wheel and^swaraj, Gandhi promised that he would appeal to every soldier and every civil employee to give up his employment aud take up the spinning- wheel; but even at this moment he told every soldier who calls himself an Indian, and every Government servant, that if they understood the message of swadeshi, it was their bounden duty to abandon their employment.   It was a sin for anybody to serve this Government.
Section 11. The speech has hitherto attracted little attention. Gandhi was asked by a number of moslem leaders to go to Karachi, but our latest information is that he replied that he could not leave bis work in Madras.It remains to be seen what the effect of bis refusal will be on hindu-mobamedan relations, but it is significant that he has apparently evaded going to Karachi and making there a-public pronouncement on the lines of the Karachi resolution in association wdth, and on the same platform as, the mohamedan leaders.Section 12. The meeting of the Jamiyat-Ululema and of the All-India caliphate &apos; committee at Delhi on the 23rd also endorsed the Karachi resolution and decided to publish and distribute widely the recently proscribed fetwa declaring service in the army and police sinful. The Simla session of the Legislature, just concluded, has been satisfactory, though a good deal of time was wasted on futile discussion, and the Assembly is inclined to show considerable opposition to the services and a desire for their rapid Indianization.THE DOMINIONS.AUSTRALIA.The Budget. On 30th September the Governor-General telegraphed the following summary of the Commonwealth Budget to the Secretary of State for the Colonies : The revenue of the last financial year was 65,517,608L, which exceeded the estimate by 2,152,0081., and the expenditure out of revenue 64,624,0371., which was 4,248,49U. below the estimate. The accumulated surplus is 6,618,327L The estimated revenue this year (not including the surplus brought forward) is 61,787,350L, and the expenditure 64,604,458Z., in which 250,000L is for immigration. There is no new taxation. The scheme recommended by the sub-committee of the British royal commission in respect of double income tax will be adopted as far as the Commonwealth income tax is concerned. The relief from State tax is left to the State Governments. The gross Commonwealth debt on 30th June was 401,720,025?., of which 359,606,719L was war debt. The net debt was 332,009,032J., which was 8,800,872?. less than at 30th June 1920.The following items of information were sent out from the office of the High Commissioner in London on 29th September : Treasurers Budget Speech. A cheerful outlook, expressing full confidence in the status of the Commonwealth, was the dominant note in the Federal Treasurer^ Budget speech delivered in the House of Representatives on Thursday last. Sir Joseph Cook submitted figures recording a most successful year, and indicated the most promising results for the new year, there being a wealth of products from staple industries in sight. In his survey of Australia^ activities, he showed that while care, caution and resolute economic readjustment are essential, there is nothing to warrant undue pessimism. Certain abnormal factors and the general economic strain are easing, and there are favourable omens in the general situation indicating that &apos; Australia is turning the financial corner. The mountain of wool is being reduced, and the demand has increased at better prices, the quality being excellent. The new clip is certain to attract buyers.The agricultural and dairying industries show a notable development, and the wheat yield for the past year has increased from nearly 46,000,000 to 144,000,000 bushels, and since the year 1915-16 over 17,000,000 tons of wheat, worth 150,000,0001. have been delivered. Butter production has increased in the past year by nearly 77,000,000 lbs. Nearly 9,000,0001. would be required to pay for this season&apos;s sugar crop, which it is estimated will yield 2,160.000 tons. During the past six years Australia has enjoyed the advantage of the cheapest sugar iu the world.The Value of Disarmament. Sir Joseph Cook laid stress on the economic import-ance of and the need for disarmament, and pointed out that disarmament meant for Germany a financial and economic relief amounting to well over 300,000,0001. per annum. Germany, he said, is in a highly favourable position to conduct an economic war competition. &quot; Unless something can be done,&quot; Sir Joseph Cook continued, &quot;to 33-2 - C
relieve us of the tremendous handicap of military armaments, we may as surely lose the economic struggle as we won the military one. Australian best means to-economic stability and national progress are increased production, shipping facilities, and the Anzac courage for difficult tasks.&quot;Revenue and Expenditure. The actual revenue for the year ended 30th June last, Sir Joseph Cook stated, was 65,517,600L, an excess on the estimate of 2,152,9082. The expenditure out of revenue was 64,624,0072., being less than the estimate by 4,246,000/-. This saving of almost 4,250,0002; was effected notwithstanding the very heavy expenditure for basic.wage and increased cost, of living allowances, which was-not provided for in the estimates. The surplus on the year&apos;s transactions was 893,5212., the accumulated surplus to 30th June last being 6,6 1 8,0002. &quot; Allowing for the results of good seasons and heavy imports at high prices,&quot; said Sir Joseph, &quot; I hope I may say that the large saving of 4,250,0002. in expenditure, is the outcome of a determined resolution to save the public funds wherever possible. Economy was practised in difficult circumstances. The cost of materials and services had increased, while the purchasing-power of money had decreased, prices in many instances increasing 100 to 300 per cent. The economy that counts best is obtained by the review and readjustment of Federal and State functions. Overlapping, misunderstanding and lack of co-ordination lead to much waste and inefficiency.&quot;For the year 1921-22 the estimated revenue is 61,787,0002., a decrease of 3,7 30,0002, Since a continuance of the past year&apos;s heavy imports and high prices cannot be safely anticipated, a reduction of 5,678,0001. has been allowed for in the estimated customs and excise receipts.. The expenditure out of the revenue is estimated at 64,604,0002., being 19,0001. less than.last year&apos;s sum. The estimated deficiency for the current year is 2,817,0002., leaving an estimated accumulated surplus of 3,801,0002. at 30th June 1922.It is anticipated, that the aggregate Commonwealth, expenditure for this year will . be 11,47 6,0002. less than last year. The principal items of proposed expenditure out of War Loan are for soldier land-settlement, 7,000,0001.; for war service homes, 4,000,0002.; and, for forestry and reserve employment allotments to the States, 196,0002. The estimated expenditure out of Works Loan, totals 5,597,0002. against 4,1.01,U00Z. for last year. The estimated expenditure out of the revenue is reduced to slightly below hist year&apos;s actual expenditure, despite the necessity for finding additional amounts aggregating 4,096,0002., and this total estimated expenditure of 81,000,0002. has been provided for after most careful scrutiny and the cutting clown of the original departmental draft estipiat^s,The estimated war pensions, expenditure for this year is 6,650,0002. as against 7,389,0002, The proposed expenditure on rural immigration is 250,0002; Provision is made for an expenditure of 500,0002. for the development of aviation including subsidies for aerial mails. It is estimated that 335,0002. will be required for the River Murray waters scheme and for the development of irrigation for closer settlement. 200,0002. is allotted for development work at the federal capital, Canberra.Income Tax-As a special consideration to primary producers it is proposed to tax incomes at a rate of tax that wall be applicable to the average income over a period of five years. The total direct and. indirect taxation of the States and Commonwealth amounts to 122. 18s. Ilc2., as against 242. 2s. (id. in the United Kingdom and 18Z. 11s. lcZ. in New Zealand. It is estimated that 15,000,0002. will be received this year from income tax, being 648,5922. more than last year. Substantial yields of wheat, butter and wool justify this expectation of increase.Public Debt. The Commonwealth&apos;s war indebtedness included 234,800,0002. owing to Australian bond holders and 92,480,0002, to the British Government. For purposes of the war. and for repatriation, 256,000,0002. were raised in Australia, and of this amount 11,598,5902. have been redeemed. The last loan for repatriation (&quot; the Diggers &quot; Loan.) of IO,000,OOOZ. was slightly over-subscribed. The war service homes expenditure at 30th June last totalled 12,626,0002., of which 12,316,0002. is recoverable. Last year&apos;s expenditure on repatriation excluding land settlement and war service homes was 3,678,0002., and it is anticipated that this vear&apos;s total will amount to 2,260,0002.German Property in New Guinea. The value of the expropriated German properties and businesses in the New Guinea territory is estimated at from 3,000.0002. to 5,000,0002. When, that value has been accurately ascertained by valuation, or sale, this sum will be credited to Germany as part payment of the reparation clue by
Germany. The Civil Administrator of this new Australian territory is pursuing an active policy with a view to the promotion of the material and moral well-being of the natives, especially in respect of education, handicrafts, agriculture, and health.NEW ZEALAND.Arrival of Mr. Massey. On 30th September the Governor-General informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that Mr. Massey had arrived at Auckland that morning.Samoa. The following telegram was sent by the Governor-General to the -Secretary of State for the Colonies on 10th October : With reference to&apos; my despatches on the subject of the petition from the natives of Samoa [praying that Samoa might be removed from the control of New Zealand and placed under the control of the Colonial Office] dated 26th August and 10th September, my Ministers state that as time goes on the indications become stronger that the petition was prompted by the white residents of Samoa. The Administrator has further reported that he has now reason to believe that the Faipules, by whom the petition was signed, have a definite idea of regaining independence, and that that they have been led to believe that the occupation of their country by Germany -did not affect their independence, but that it has never been abrogated and still exists. In the opinion of my Ministers it is therefore essential that the question of the position of New Zealand in regard to Samoa should be authoritatively and promptly -explained to the Samoans.Washington Conference. On 12th October the Governor-General reported to the -Secretary of State for the Colonies : The Government of New Zealand have appointed the Hon. Sir John Salmond, a Judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, as representative of this Dominion at the conference. He will leave New Zealand next week by the S.S. Niagara, accom-panied by his secretary. Mr. E. 0.

On 19th September ReuteFs Capetown agent telegraphed as follows  Mass meetings of railwaymen held at various centres throughout the Union continue to protest against the decision to increase the eight-hour day for certain .grades of railway service where conditions are held to warrant it, but the general attitude adopted is very moderate.Addressing a mass meeting of railwaymen at Johannesburg to-day, Colonel Creswell, formerly Labour leader in the Union House of Assembly, said he w-as not in favour of anything in the nature of a &quot;go-slow&quot; policy or a strike. He was, he said, of opinion that the best way to avoid knocks was to think from now on and so to organize themselves in such a way that no Government wrould be able to do as the present Government was doing to-day. He did not know, he continued, whether the railwaymen intended striking, but he counselled them in their own interests not to take such a step, and he urged his hearers to use their votes in future elections in order to send men to parliament who would represent their views.The meeting adopted a resolution, moved by Colonel Creswell, most strongly protesting at the Government^ violation of the Labour charter and the Washington Labour agreement, and calling on the Government to adhere to the principle of the eight-hours&apos; clay.Four clays later the following telegram was sent by ReutePs agent in Johannesburg The general secretary of the National Union of Railway and Harbour Servants has sent a letter to the Labour office of the League of Nations protesting against the
selection of the South African delegates, Mr. Archibald Crawford arid Mrs. Fitzgerald,, on the ground that the union, which represents 80,000 workers, was not consulted and declaring that the union cannot accept Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Fitzgerald as-adequately representing the Labour requirements of South Africa and cannot necessarily be bound by decisions in which they participate. Mrs.- Fitzgerald is Mr. Crawford&apos;s wife.ReuteFs agent added that the National Union of Railway and Harbour Servants had recently protested to General Smuts against the Railway Administrations-proposed modifications in the eight-hour day as not being in accordance with the peace treaty, and that; General Smuts had replied by stating that it had been explained to the Labour Office of the League of Nations that a universal eight-hour day was not suitable to South African conditions and could only be applied in the large centres. General Smuts had added that in view of the serious financial position of the South African railways he could not interfere with the action of the Railwajr Achninistration.Jewish Orphans from Eastern Europe. ReuteFs agent reported from Capetown on 20th September that 200 Jewish orphan children, collected from the pogrom areas of eastern Europe who are to be taken into the care of the Jewish orphanage at Capetown and the trustees of the Jewish war victims and orphan fund, had arrived under the charge of Mr. Ochberg and had left for various destinations.Civil Servants&apos; War Bonus withdrawn. The following was sent from Pretoria by ReuteFs agent on 27th September : We must bow to the inevitable, was the remark, made by General Smuts in the course of a reply to a deputation representing the civil service which had waited on him regarding the abolition of the war bonus. The Premier reviewed the financial situation and pointed out that the position which faced the Government at the end of the last financial year had become worse. The Customs were probably l,50O,O00Z. below the estimates, wdrile other sources of revenue showed a shortage, and despite various measures, including increased taxation to the extent of 2,500,O0OZ., the deficit would be larger than was buclgettecl for. Further taxation, declared General Smuts, could not be contemplated, and on the other hand retrenchment must be kept within narrow limits. The railway position was even worse than the general public revenue. The Government, therefore, however reluctant, had no choice but to proceed with the withdrawal of the war bonus.General Smuts emphasized in the course of his reply that he did not despair of the future as conditions were sound.The Wages Question. ReuteFs agent reported from Capetown on 6th October : The reductions in wages proportionately with the decline in the cost of living which are occurring in&apos;most trades and industries sometimes lead to disputes, as in the case of the skilled artizans employed by the Capetown municipality, who have struck owing to the 10 per cent, reduction made on 1st October. They declare that this reduction violates the existing agreement. Conversations are proceeding at Johannesburg regarding the proposed readjustment of wages in the coalmines, which the colliery section of the Chamber of Mines desires to effect on a scale similar to that embodied in the gold mines agreement.A reduction of wages of shop assistants lias been recommended by the joint board representing the Chamber of Commerce and the Shop Assistants&apos; Union, but on such a scale that when the cost of living falls to a conventional zero, wages will beper cent, above pre-war rates.
