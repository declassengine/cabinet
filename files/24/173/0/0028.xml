9^1S DOOiEISKT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC HAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.Memorandum by tbo Minister of Labour.UNEMPLOYMENT    INSURANCE,,9,26(35).1.     My colleagues will have observed the agitation for an inquiry into unemployment insurance which is being worked up in the Press in connection with tho Budget pro-poeals.     It would, I feel sure, be unwise to take procipi-tate action of this kind.     There aro certain things, in-eluding the setting up of an inquiry later In tho year, on which we have been working for some little time and which -I hope to be able to put in dotail to the Cabinet in a memorandum next week.     Meanwhile I give an outline of them so that my colleagues may know generally how the matter stands.2.     My proposals include(a) .A Bill to extend after 1st October next the power of waiving the requirement of 30 contributions paid in the past 2 or 3 years, which would otherwise become as from that date a condition precedent to tho payment of benefit.      Such a Bill is necessary if something in the neighbourhood of 300,000 or 250,000 persons are not to be suddenly cut off benefit on October 1st.     I am considering how far this continued relaxation of tho conditions for benefit should be combined with other provisions designed to make a corresponding saving in benefit)
9 -7:9t* 8  &amp;(b) Certain further administrativerestrictions (to come into operation simultaneously - with the introduction of the Bill) on the exerciseof the power of waiving the 30 contributionsrequirement j(o) an enquiry into Unemployment Insurance,to take place in the autumn. 3.     The need for an enquiry arises quite independently of the present agitation.    Under last year*s Act all benefit comes to an end in June 1923 and before we ean deal with the situation thus arising we must be advised by a Committee representative of employers and employed and others interested as to the general principles on which we should proceed.   If such a Committee vrere appointed now it would be pressed to report in a hurry and its conclusions, hastily arrived at perhaps   in the light of rather temporary consideration, would not be a reliable foundation on which to build. The right time at which to set up such a Committee is in the autumn and this is what I intend to propose.(Intd.) A,S,- M,Ministry of Labour, 4th May, 1955.
