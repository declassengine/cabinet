The Committee are in agreement with the Conclusions reached by the Minister of Pensions in a Memorandum (7/.P.C.   (25)  2,  circulated to the Committee, a copy of which is attached to this Report.    The Committee find that the proposals .made by the British Legion would involve fundamental alterations in the principles of war pensions which have been approved by successivg Governments and. Parliaments and would  seriously affect in the future the financial liabilities of the State; and they agree with, the position adopted by the late Government   in correspon-denco with the Ministry that &quot;They cannot contemplate any material departure from the fundamental principles on which the pensions system of this country has been for so long established.&quot;    (Treasury-le-tter 29/2/24 - ff.7172). S.      In these circumstances the Committee express their entire agreement with the annoxmcement made by the Prime Minister that the appointment of a Select Committee to consider these and other proposals for extension of the Warrants and War Pensions Acts would not be justified.: (Hansard,  26th March, 1925 - Cols.  599-600).
4.      The Committee further think that the practice of dealing with exceptional cases under, the Dispensing Warrant should be continued for the present,    The Treasury and the Ministry of Pensions are in consultation on this particular matter.Signed on behalf of the Committee.Gr t.

The two proposals made by the British Legion in the petition to which signatures have now been invited are: -(i)   that the time-limit imposed in the Royal Warrants should be entirely abolished for officers and men, widows and dependants?(ii)   that officers and men should have a right ofappeal to an independent Tribunal in cases where the Ministry refuses to grant further compensation after a final allowance, and the claimant can produce medical evidence that the disability has re-asserted Itself or became worse.(1)   Time Limits.2.     Time limits on fresh claims to pension are statutory in the case of officers and men (Section 5, War Pensions Act, 1921) and Warrant provision in the case of widows and dependants,3*     Disablement Claims by Officers and Men.     Section 5 ,: of the War Pensions Act, 1921, provides that the power of the Minister to grant a pension &quot;in respeot of disablement shall not be exercised unless the claim in respect of the disablement is made within seven years after the date on which the claimant was discharged or the date fixed under the Termination of the Present War (Definition) Aet, 1918, as the date of the termination of the present War, whichever date Is the earlier4.     The reasons for this provision were fully explained to the House by the Minister in connection with the Bill of 1921, and were unanimously accepted without objection from any side of the House, or until quite recently from the British Legion.     The justification for the provision is briefly:-(a)   The special conditions of service in the late War make it essential that there should be a limit of time within whioh claims for compensation must be made.     The period of Great War service for 99 out of every 100 men, was in fact a brief period of exceptional employment of a special kind.     Men were engaged at all ages and the State enlisted their services necessarilywithout
without ragard to their occupations, in ignorance of their past medical history and, to a very great extent, without medical knowledge even of their physical condition at the time of enlistment.     On the termination of hostilities men were demobilised wholesale without any medical examination except in a few cases where men claimed to be disabled.     Under these conditions (which fundamentally differentiate National service in the late War from service in Professional Forces) the State is increasingly at a disadvantage in obtaining reliable evidence on which to determine claims,     A further consequence is that with the present generous scale of compensation any and every ailment common to the civil population is made the subject of a claim.     Of the claims made at the present time in new oases, six are for ordinary ailments to one in respect of injury.     With the entire removal of the time limit both difficulties become overwhelming.(b) Again, the special circumstances of the War made it necessary to adopt a considerably greater latitude in admitting claims than would be justifiable in dealing with claims from members of the Professional Forces or under any civil scheme of compensation.     So far from it being true (as alleged by the British Legion in the Memorandum attached to the Petition) that &quot;an applicant has to prove his claim to entitlement before pension is granted&quot; the claimant has to produce no more than a prima facie case as tohib health before enlistment and since discharge. The Ministry itself seek the further direct evidence, if any is available, as to the origin of his ailment, and Judge as best it can accordingly.     The claim is not necessarily rejected because of mere failure of direct evidence.     Even so, the rejection of any claims has been criticised.     &quot;Fit for service, fit for pension&quot; was heard as early as 1918 and the compromise doctrine of the &quot;Benefit of the doubt&quot; * had to be adopted, first of all in the case of the man discharged on account of disability and later (with less justification) in regard to claims from demobilised men.     With the removal of all limit of time for fresh claims, as suggested by the Legion, this principle must obviously become, not a mode of determining cases in which evidence is conflicting, but a formula for the admission of claims because of the complete failure of evidence.(c) In these circumstances, it is in the interests of genuine claimants that there should be a time limit.      Increasing admission of bad claims can only react upon the pension scheme as a whole. It Is, of course, a condition of the time limit that it should be generally known.     The MinistryhaveThe principle of the &quot;Benefit of the doubt&quot; is laid down more fully in correspondence with the Treasury as &quot;Unless it is clear that the balance of probability is against the man,the benefit should be given&quot;.
*       The rates-are, for the widow of an ex-private, 20/s. a week if under 40 and without ohildrenand 26/8d, for a widow with children or over 40.     For widows of men of higher military rank the pension rate increases up to a maximum of 30/s. and 40/s. a week respectively.for widows of ex--sergeant-majors Weekly Allowances for children are payable in addition at trie rate of io/s..for the first child..7/6d-* for the second and 6/s. for each subsequent child.have taken ape-cial steps from time to time to advertise it and, as recently as January last, a coloured, poster was exhibited at all Post Of flees, and. the, British Legion have also made it generally known through their Branches.(d) The Minister was advised by his medical advisers that a time limit was reasonable on merits, and that the limit of seven years (which was already in the Warrant. as regards claims by widows, other than widows of existing pensioners) wasa generous limit and was fully sufficient to cover the period within which the injury or ailment really due from War service should be manifested.(e) Other countries have adopted time limits of varying extent for claims In respect of disablement&apos; arising out of Great War service. The limits are In all cases narrower than the seven years (e.g., Canada - 3 years (except in specified cases where certain hospital   \ entries occurred during service);   New Zealand and Australia - 6 months from discharge except for good causes shown otherwise; United States of America - 5 years after discharge, or beginning of illness,5,     The Ministry have appreciated that a few cases may occur in exceptional circumstances in which compensation for disablement by War service must be admitted notwithstanding that the claim has been made more than seven years1 after discharge.     About six cases have occurred in which either owing to absence in remote parts abroad no opportunity of making a claim within the statutory time presented itself, or cases in which a bullet or other foreign body had not previously been discovered but owing to some accidental circumstances has only brought about actual disablement long after the man1s discharge;     Such cases have been met by the use of the Dispensing Warrant. But the fact that such exceptional cases may exist Is hot ground for continuing for all time the automatic procedure of investigation and   adjudication by the Ministry (together with the apparatus of appeal to the independent Appeal Tribunals) in respect of every claim that is made; In the minister&apos;s judgment the discretionary procedure is adequate to meet all cases in which serious disablement claimed after 7 years can be conclusively shown to be due to War service *6.     Time limits on claims by widows and dependants. The provisions of the Great ?fe.r Warrants affecting widows are . quoted in full in Appendix &quot;A&quot;.     Briefly paraphrased, they amount to-(a)   The grant of a pension at maximum rate55 to the widow of any ex-service man who dies^ within 7 years after his discharge from service or removal from duty, of a disability certified to be attributable to or aggravated by his service or which commenced on his service;    and
tJ hi) 0(b)    To the widow of a man who wag drawing pension at the time of his death, &quot;the grant &quot;of a pension at varying rates.      If his death is certified to have been &quot;wholly due to the nature&apos; of the condition or. disability in respect of which the said pension or allowance was awarded,  such nature or condition having resulted as a direct consequence of his war service&apos;1 the pension is at: the maximum rate;      or, if the man&apos;s death was materially accelerated by his war service,       &apos;*. though not to the extent of justifying an award at  the maximum rate of pension, the &apos; widow&apos;s pension is. at the rate of one-half of the husband &apos; s disablement pension.;&apos;     In either case, however, allowances are given at the maximum rate for any pensionable children.(7)    The time limit of seven years from the man&apos;s discharge for a claim by the; widow of any ex-service man, whether he is a pensioner or not, is common&apos;to the pre-war and post-war warrants of the service departments and in their case is the sole provision for   the compensation of widowhood.      The first Ministry  of Pensions Warrant (The Barnes. Warrant of 1917 - which was approved by the House) extended the 7- years time limit of the pre-war wsrrant in. favour of the widow of the. pensioner only,&apos; and to the principle of this amendment successive governments have adhered..    Amendments to the scale of. pension which might be awarded after 7 years were made by the last Conservative Government in the Warrants of 1923 and January,  1024, which had the. effect; of practically trebling the&apos; amount&apos; of pension that might be drawn by the widow of a pensioner,, whose death came within, the terms of the Warrants. ,.  The late Labour Government, so far approved the general principle as to extend it to dependants, by. the. Warrant of the &apos; 2nd. September,  1924...   ,       .(8)    The present demand of the British Legion for the entire removal of all time limits in regard to claims by widows and dependants is unsound in; principle, and would involve heavy additional, liability:- -        ......(a)   The line drawn at 7 years from a man&apos;adischarge was a: maximum and not a minimum . - limit.      It must reasonably be held thatwith increasing, lapse- of time, even, in the case of a man admitted to have been/&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos; disabled to any extend-by war service, the . direct connection between death-, and the man&apos;s long past war; service- ordinarily becomes more ..  remote when allowance is made for the intervening conditions of life or for other ailments, and consequently the liability of the State to pay full rate of pension (which would be proper where death had occurred in action or shortly &quot;after service), should be recognised as equally -   diminished.      This principle is recognised in the Ministry Warrants, which in the case of death occurring after 7 years, aim at ,&apos;-   adjusting the State&apos;s liability in proportion to the degree of connection &quot; between the man&apos;s death and his war. service, &apos;        .    whenever during his lifetime the man had admittedly been disabled.      The Legion&apos;proposal
proposal on the other hand -would automatically grant a pension to the widow, whenever the man had died of a number of ailments of which perhaps his pensionable disability was only one.(b) Moreover, the removal of the time limitfrom Article II of the Warrant would mean the grant of a maximum pension    (i) to the widow of a man who himself had never claimed a   pension during his life time, and probably did not consider that he had such a claim and (ii) to the widow of a man who could not have claimed a pension during his life time,      This amendment of the Warrant would obviously mean that the State was liable to deal with claims from trie widows of any of  the 4,000,000 demobilised men who themselves have not made,  or may never make, a claim for pension. If the time limit is sound in the case of men s claims, it would be impossible not to adhere to it as regards widows&apos; claims also.(c) The same difficulty (due to the same causes) in the way of obtaining evidence for or against a claim, as would arise in the case of claims made by officers or men for disablement many years after the termination of their service, would obviously occur (and to an even greater extent) in the case of claims of widows of non-pensioners if the present time limit of 7 years were removed.(9)    In the Minister&apos;s judgment, which is supported by the experience of the Department, the provisions of the Warrants,  as amended in 1923 and 1924,  adequately meet the normal case.      It is recognised,  of course, that an exceptional case may occur, under the same exceptional circumstances as apply to men1s claims in respect of disablement, after the expiry of the time limit. One or two such cases have already been recognised by an&quot; award under the Dispensing Warrant, but this is no ground for upsetting the general principles of  the Warrants which have been approved by the House.      The demand of the Legion, if conceded, would add heavily both to the prospective liability for pensions and also to the cost of administration (including both the till mstry s machinery and the machinery of the Independent Appeal Tribunals).      It would also react seriously upon t he Warrants of the Service Departments.
(10)   The British Legion&apos;s proposal would affect only one class of final award, but that a   very large class. The proposal would involve legislation by way of amendment of Section 4 of the War Pensions Act, 1921, and the concession, if acceded to for this class, could not be confined to it but would have to be extended to the whole range of final awards, with the result that the principle of finality of settlement which was unanimously accepted by Parliament in 1921 would have to be abandoned.(11)   A final award is a final settlement (subject to the right of appeal) both against the State and against the man of the rate of compensation due in respect of disablement sustained In consequence of an injury or ailment that has arisen out of the officers or man&apos;s war service.     It is arrived at only after such a time since the first award of compensation to the man as admits of a proper medical judgment being formed as to both the possibility of arriving at a final settlement and as to the amount of it;      as such a final award has regard both to the past history of the case and to its future.     The rates of compensation are the rates of the pension warrants . which have been in operation for the past eight yeaps. These are graded at intervals of 10 per cent, from 100 per cent. ( - total disablement) down to 20 per cent.     A final award at the.rate of 20 per cent, or over carries a life pension at  the rate fixed.    (With this class of final award the British Legion have professed satisfaction).     For slight disablement assessed at  less than 20 per cent. compensation takes the form either of a lump sum gratuity or of a   terminal allowance extending over a period from six months to three years according to the nature of the case, and the ajgg^K^psfee- compensation, given must not amount in the aggregate to more than  200.(12)   Every officer or man for whom a final award is fixed is given the right of appeal against the Ministry&apos;s award to one of the independent Appeal Tribunals consisting of two doctors and one ex-service officer or man.       Members of the Tribunal are appointed by the Lord Chancellor (and the corresponding judicial authorities in Scotland and Ireland),      The right of appeal is exerciseable within one year of the notification to the man by the Ministry of his final award.      In notifying a final award It is the practice of the Ministry to draw particular attention to the right of appeal.(13)   The difficulties in the way of the Legion&apos;s proposal are -(a)    It abolishes in effect all finality as regards one class of case only, and that class the least disabled by their war service.     For this class it substitutes for finality the prospect of endless litigation since the men concerned would apparently have the right of appeal to the Tribunal as often as they were ill and were dissatisfied if the Ministry saw no ground for making an award of pension or further award of less than 20 per cent.The
The proposal amounts in short to a rather poorly disguised attempt to get every man some day on to the pension list for life who has ever -had any compensation however slight his disablement.(b) The British Legion disclaim any desire to upset final awards of life pension, but the concession,  if made, could certainly not be confined to cases of disablement assessed at less than 20%, because,  on the face of it,, the more seriously disabled case would clearly have a better claim to be given a further right of appeal  in the    same circumstances,If so, this must be the end of all finality of settlement and the immediate result must be that those cases in which an award of life pension has already been made (and made on the basis of an average anticipated disablement) would have to be assumed to be in receipt of no more than a minimum pension. This opens a   vast prospect of Increased    v liability to the Ministry in later years, There are already 250,000 awards of life pension in issue.(c) The adequacy, of the principle of compensation in cases of;under 20 per cent, assessment cannot at this stage be seriously called in question.     The principle was not only a principle of the.pre-war Warrants as well as those of the Great War , but has been adopted for the post-war Warrants.     Moreover,   : applied to cases of the Great War the adequacy of the compensation has been tested by the&apos;appeals made to the independent,  Appeals Tribunal who are free to increase that - award wherever they think proper -vfhaving regard to all the circumstances of the case&quot; (Section 4, War   Pensions Act, 1921).   About -102,000 cases of final awards, at this rate of assessment have made &apos; an appeal and have been decided;    but only 5% have been granted an increased award which takes them into the pension scale.(14)    The statistical position of the pension list will be of assistance to the Committee in considering this question:-(a) Under the operation of the War Pensions Act, 1921, there have been made 250,000 life pensions,  (i.et, pensions at all rates from 20^ up to lOOfr).(b) There have been made a net number of 240,000 awards of under 20% assessment of which 55,300 (or about 22 per cent.) have been confirmed on appeal as final  awards at this assessment by the Appeal Tribunals.There
There remain on the pension list, drawing: temporary or conditional  pension, 250,000 cases, which are still liable to review.      Very many of  these cases will never be found suitable for final award because the Ministry are,advised that having regard to the nature of their disease si the men are likely to get materially worse, arid for these cases prolonged periods of pension are being given.      The net result has been a very sat us factory reduction of the machinery of the Ministry/ which is handling not more than 2,500 cases a week at the present time as compared with 15,000 a week four years ago.      This position would be completely upset by the British Legion&apos;s proposal which would have the effect of at  once increasing: the staff and machinery of the Department.&apos;(15)    The practice of the Ministry.     During, the passage of the Bill &quot;of&quot;&quot;192i In theTTouse it Y*as explained by the Minister that, while in all suitable cases and subject to the right of appeal, the final   award would be a final settlement of the amount of current compensation, the pensioner would remain entitled, to medical treatment, if he became worse, and to the special allowances at   the maximum rate of pension available under the Warrant, if the circumstances of his case made him eligible for them.      This principle was accepted by the House and this promise has been carried out.     Hot only are pensioners eligible for medical treatment with allowances from the Ministry, but in also the great majority of cases of awards of less than 20%, notwithstanding that their current compensation may have expired.  *(16)   At the same time,  while maintaining the principle of finality of settlement,  the Ministry have on medical advice recognised that there will be exceptional cases in which it will be found that  definite error of medical fact or judgment has occurred which in equity vitiates the final settlement.     After consultation with the Treasury the view taken by the Ministry was that, while imtmrn- fvJS.,^ dissatisfaction felt by the beneficiary regarding his final award was properly dealt with by the exercise of his right of appeal to the independent Appeal Tribunal, it was nevertheless equitable to provide for the few cases in which there was definite error of diagnosis or of prognosis,-which had not,  or could   not have, been put right by appeal within the year.     Error of -this kind could obviously only be determined either on -the one hand by throwing open again the door of claim or appeal to every man who had had a final award or on the other hard by some method which would automatically select the cases to be dealt with.- .-- - - The* The only cases excepted from the automatic grantof medical treatment and allowances are the few cases in which the degree of disablement being of a minor kind, compensation was given on the ground that  the man&apos;s ailment was aggravated, i,e., worsened only to a small extent by his War Service, but not caused by it.   Even in these cases, however,  the Ministry reserve the right to admit to medical treatment with allowances, even after the expiry of the grant,  if it is, certified that the aggravation produced by the inari&apos;s war service is the cause of his present condition requiring treatment.
The former method would have involved legislation&quot; and would obviously have imperilled the principle; of final;settlement.      It was decided,  therefore, that the sound as well as the commonsense method was to assume -that, in any case which was likely, to prove one&apos; of error/ the man would, in the natural course,  seek medical treatment at  the hands of the ministry, - Instructions were, therefore,,, issued to medical officers of the Ministry that they were to report on all cases of final award in which it appeared to them, following a course of treatment that there were grounds for considering that the final award was clearly erroneous as Involving a serious and permanent ,under-assessment of the man&apos;s condition.       Following any such report every case is medically examined by a board and reported to the Ministry, who are able by arrangement with the Treasury to secure an amended award in the case under the Dispensing Warrant.(17)   This procedure applies to all classes of awards whether under or over 20% assessment and appears to the Minister the only method compatible with the maintenance of the principles of final settlement.&apos; . - &apos;G.C..
