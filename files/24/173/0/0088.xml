[This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.       June 1925.SECRET.CP. 286(25).I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum upon the subject of Afghanistan which, long as it is (I think necessarily), I hope that they will find time to read    The&apos; situation requires watching, and an early decision wiH*be required in the matter of the proposed subsidy.BIRKENHEAD.AFGHANISTAN.Recent developments in Afghanistan give some cause for concern as to the future-For an adequate appreciation of the situation, some reference must be made to past history.The Afghan question, as it now presents itself, is a growth of the last six years,. Reduced to essentials, British interest in Afghanistan is, as before, practically limited to a desire to see her established as a good neighbour to India, both refraining herself from stirring up troubles in India or on the frontier, and acting as a &quot; buffer &quot; against hostile advances from beyond her borders. But other factors have changed. Prior to 1919, British relations with Afghanistan rested on agreements under which the British Government controlled Afghan foreign relations (in theory, though not quite completely in practice), and in return gave a guarantee of assistance in repelling unprovoked aggression. The Amir also received from the Government of India a subsidy, which, increased from time to time, amounted in 1919 to Rs. 20-1- lakhs (137,OOU .) a year. The Russian Government had, by the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, declared that they recognised Afghanistan as outside the sphere of Russian influence, and engaged that all their political relations with Afghanistan should be conducted through the intermediary of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Russian revolution introduced the first fundamental change in the situation. It was followed in 1919 by the murder of the Amir Habibulla, aggression on the frontier by the new Amir, Amanulla, and war with Afghanistan, which opened a new era in Afghan affairs. The treaty of peace, signed at Rawalpindi in August 1919, was supplemented by a letter in which the chief British representative explicitly recognised that &quot; the said treaty and this.letter leave Afghanistan officially free and independent in its internal and external affairs. Moreover, this war has cancelled all previous treaties.&quot; The treaty of peace definitely cancelled the subsidy and withdrew the privilege of importing arms through India. At the same time it provided that, if the Afghan Government proved by their actions that they were sincerely anxious to regain the friendship of the British Government, another Afghan Mission&apos;would be received after six months &quot;for the discussion and statement of matters of common interest to the two Governments, and the re-establishment of the old friendship on a satisfactory basis.&quot;The Afghan attitude and conduct during the prescribed period of probation were unsatisfactory in various respects. e.g., in regard to dealings with the frontier tribes, Bolshevik agents and Indian seditionists. On the other hand, disturbing factors had b?e&apos;n introduced since the treaty of peace was signed. The British position in the East had weakened ; the Bolshevik position had been greatly strengthened ; an Afghan Mission had been received in Moscow and a Bolshevik mission in Kabul. An Afghan Mission was finally invited to Mussoorie in April 1920, but for the prarpose merely of &quot; removing difficulties and misunderstandings,&quot; and not of completing the re-establishment of friendly relations in the manner foreshadowed by the treaty of 1919. The Conference sat at Mussoorie from April to July, and the Afghan delegates were finally given an aide-memoire setting out the terms on which the British Government would be prepared to conclude a treaty of friendship, which it was contemplated would, while preserving full Afghan independence in both internal and external affairs, at the same time revive the yearly subsidy to the amount of Rs. 1.8 lakhs (120.000Z.).The Amir shortly afterwards invited the despatch of British representatives to Kabul to conclude such a treaty, and although his attitude in regard to various points 462      100   6.25
Temained unsatisfactory, the invitation was in the end accepted, and a British Mission under Sir Henry Dobbs was despatched to Kabul in January 1921. There followed ten months of tedious and fluctuating negotiations, the Afghan attitude varying with external political events. One factor of importance was that in February 1921 the Russians finally signed at Moscow a Russo-Afghan treaty which had been under negotiation for some time and which provided, among other things, for the payment of a subsidy of one million roubles a year by Russia to Afghanistan and for the establishment of Russian Consuls at various places in Afghanistan, including Kandahar and Ghazni. A treaty of friendship between Angora and Afghanistan was signed, also at Moscow, shortly afterwards. In the course of the protracted Anglo-Afghan negotiations, various proposals were put forward from either side. In May, the Amir having made advances in this direction, Sir H. Dobbs received instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government to do all in his power to negotiate a treaty which would exclude a treaty between Afghanistan and the Soviet Government -and would also, if possible, exclude Bolsheviks from Afghanistan. Agreement seemed to be nearly reached on such an &quot; exclusive&quot; treaty, on the basis that Afghanistan would bring about a complete rupture of relations with Russia, on the pretext of the latter&apos;s treatment of Bokhara and Khiva, in return for an annual subsidy from the British Government of Rs. 40 lakhs (2G7,000Z.), an immediate gift of rifles and guns, and a promise of further assistance in money, munitions and aeroplanes in the event of unprovoked Russian aggression. Difficulties, however, arose over details, and especially in regard to a formula for consultation as to agreements with other Powers, which the Afghans regarded as inconsistent with their independence ; Afghan policy took another turn ; the Amir in August ratified the Russo-Afghan treaty, subject to an understanding that the Soviet Consulates near the Indian frontier would not at once be insisted on ; and the Afghans, stating that in view of the inadequate assistance promised by the British against Russian aggression they considered the policy of complete exclusion of Russia dangerous and disadvantageous, propounded a new draft treaty, much on the lines originally contemplated, under which Afghanistan would receive a subsidy of Rs. 201;- lakhs (137,000L). Further difficulties and fluctuations followed, including repeated attempts by the Amir to return to the &quot; exclusive &quot; treaty (for the sake of which he expressed himself as ready to repudiate the treaty just concluded with Russia). Finally, after negotiations had several times looked like breaking down altogether, agreement was somewhat suddenly reached on a new draft treaty, described as one of &quot;neighbourly relations &quot; rather than of &quot;friendship.&quot;This treaty, signed in November 1921, at present governs British relations with Afghanistan. By its terms the British and Afghan Governments &quot;mutually certify and respect each with regard to the other all rights of internal and external independence,&quot; and provision is made for the appointment of a British Minister at Kabul and an Afghan Minister in London. No subsidy is granted to Afghanistan, nor any special concessions, except a remission of Customs duties on goods passing through India to Afghanistan, which is by a letter appended to the treaty ruade dependent on the continued exclusion of Russian Consular or other representatives from Eastern Afghanistan. The treaty was made for three years in the first instance, and is now subject to denunciation by either party with 12 months&apos; notice. In accordance with the treaty, Lieut.-Colonel (now Sir F.) Humphrys arrived in Kabul as British Minister in March 1922, and an Afghan Minister was established in London in the following month.It has been generally considered hitherto that in present circumstances this treaty sufficiently meets British. requirements : and it is evidently preferable to a treaty involving extensive financial or other commitments to the Afghans, whatever the Afghans might promise in return. Ou the other hand Sir F. Humphrys lias always expressed the view that the Afghans were anxious to exchange the treaty for one of closer relations, i.e., one from which they would derive more tangible benefits, and has reported from time to time tentative approaches by the Amir or Afghan Foreign Minister to this subject in conversation. The way was left open for further discussion on the conclusion of the .1921 treaty, when the Amir, having again announced au intention of making friendship with Great Britain mid breaking with Russia, was given an assurance that, if he persisted in his purpose of getting cle)!U&apos;Russian entanglements, he would find that the British Minister would, certainlyof beprepared to discuss matters further on arrival at Kabul. The &quot; Russian entaiigle-ments,&quot; however, of course still remain, and hitherto the Afghan Government has taken no overt steps in the direction of denouncing the existing Anglo-Afghan treaty
8oi it seems very improbable that they would take the risk of doing this, except by agreement, in present circumstances.Sir F. Humphrys in a despatch of December 1923 examined at length the questions that would be likely to arise in the event of negotiations having to be undertaken for a new treaty with Afghanistan. He expressed the views that no attempt should be made to regain control of Afghan foreign relations, and that any demand for an annual subsidy in cash should be refused. On the other hand he advocated the policy of what he called a &quot; subsidy in kind,&quot; i.e. that, as an expression of goodwill, and a form of assistance in the peaceful progress of the country, gifts, not of cash, and not guaranteed in the treaty, or of a specified amount, should be made at irregular intervals so long as they were deserved by good behaviour on the part of the Afghan Government. He suggested that the maximum value should be Rs. 7 lakhs (47,0O0L) a year, and instanced, as possible applications of the policy, the loan of British technical experts and the supply of British machinery and plant. No occasion having yet arisen for contemplating new negotiations, no orders have hitherto been passed on this suggestion or on other points of detail in Sir F. Humphrys&apos; despatch.Since, the conclusion of the treaty of 1921, British-Afghan relations have, on the whole, been as satisfactory, perhaps, as was to be expected. The British Government has steadily pursued a policy of friendliness and scrupulous respect for Afghan independence and for treaty obligations generally. The main standing-cause of difficulties has been the failure of the Amir to discontinue completely, or even to the extent that a more elastic interpretation of the requirements of &quot; neighbourliness &quot; might indicate, his relations e.g., through the payment of allowances with the Path an tribes in &quot; independent territory&quot; on the British side of the &quot; Durand line,&quot; which forms the boundary between India and Afghanistan. Causes of complaint under this head, coupled with the failure of the Afghan, authorities to take effective action against the gangs implicated in certain outrages on the North-West Frontier, brought about an acute crisis in British-Afghan relations in 1923. It became evident that little or no satisfaction would be obtained from the Afghans unless strong pressure was brought to bear, and a consignment of arms en route to Afghanistan was held up in India under the. clause in the treaty which makes free passage for arms dependent upon the British Government being &quot;assured that the intentions of the Government of Afghanistan are friendly.&quot; Eventually action was taken which, though falling short of the British demands, was considered adequate proof of Afghan goodwill, and the arms were allowed to pass. The Amir was also induced to agree that the whole question of his relations with, the tribesmen on the British side of the line must be discussed ; but before any effective discussion could be initiated the Amir and his Government found them-selves fully occupied, in dealing with a serious tribal rising. Discussion of more general political questions with the Afghan Government necessarily lapsed for the time being, and no political issues of major importance emerged again until the recent developments with which it is the primary object of this note to deal.Before dealing with these developments it will be desirable, however, to say something as to the progress in recent years of Afghanistan&apos;s foreign relations with, countries other than Great Britain and India, and of her internal affairs.Little need be said as to foreign relations, apart from relations with the Soviet Government, which will be separately referred to later. The policy of the present Amir, ever since his accession, has been to make the fullest possible display of Afghanistan&apos;s newly acquired independence in the international sphere. Ministers have been exchanged with Turkey, Persia, France, Italy, and Germany, as well as with Great Britain and Russia ; but political relations in these cases have hitherto been mainly of a rather perfunctory nature and need not be further noticed for present purposes.In internal affairs, the Amir has pursued, apparently with great zeal, if often with little discretion, the aim of reforming the administration and in some degree that of developing the resources of the country. One feature of his policy has been extravagant expenditure on new and sometimes useless projects ; but many, or perhaps most, of the &quot;reforms &quot; e.g., the extension of education, the introduction of a budget, and the putting down of corruption are no doubt desirable in themselves. It seems probable, however, that wherever they have passed beyond the stage of paper regulations, they have almost without exception come into conflict with the habits and opinions of the majority of the population. There is no doubt that the &quot;reforms &quot; were a main contributing factor to the serious rising that broke out in the
spring of 1924. Trouble had been brewing for some time, and by the middle of April the whole of the Southern Province was involved. The rising appears to have been due to two principal causes the Mullahs&apos; dislike of the spread of education the employment of foreigners, and the Amir&apos;s new &quot; Fundamental Code,&quot; which they held to be in many respects a violation of Moslem law, and the tribesmen&apos;s dislike of the new rules for conscript service. The rebels achieved considerable successes and the insurrection spread, while the situation was complicated in July by the fact that Abdul Karim, the illegitimate son of the ex-Amir Yakub, escaped from surveillance in India and put himself at the head of the rebel tribesmen. The situation appeared very serious in August; but more energetic military action by the Afghan Government, combined with the arrival at the beginning of September of two Bristol fighter aeroplanes, which were sold by the Government of India to the Afghan Government and flown by British airmen to Kabul, where they caused a deep impression, brought about a more favourable turn of events. In&apos; the course of the autumn the Government gradually got the upper hand over the tribesmen, partly by judicious but lavish bribery, partly by the unexpectedly successful operations of Hazara aud other levies, and partly owing to the fact that many of the revolting tribesmen left the scene of conflict on their annual migration to India. Abdul Karim fled to India, and has been imprisoned there. Fears were entertained that the rebellion would break out again this spring, with the return from India of the emigrants among the rebel tribesmen. No such development appears yet to have occurred - partly, no doubt, because the- Government of India took special measures to prevent this possibility, as far as they could, before allowing the emigrants to return to Afghanistan. But the Amir does not stand in a strong position to deal with any further troubles, with his treasury depleted and a correspondingly lessened prospect of being able to count again on levies from the central and eastern provinces, and with his regular army thoroughly discredited. It is somewhat ominous that on the 26th May Sir F. Humphrys reported that he had been informed by the Afghan Foreign Minister that a local insurrection had broken out, but had already been suppressed, in another part of Afghanistan-Badakhshan, in the north on the Russian border.Reference may now be made to the most recent developments in the general situation. On the 20th April Sir F. Humphrys reported that on the loth he had had a long audience with the Amir. The Amir, while claiming that his desire was to have Great Britain as an intimate friend and Russia as a neighbourly acquaintance, took the occasion to complain of what he considered the cold, though admittedly correct, attitude that the British Government had adopted towards him in his hour of need, and to mention that the Russians had presented him with 5,000 rifles in addition to those promised under their treaty. Sir F. Humphrys expressed the view that the Amir was in serious financial straits, and would prefer to lean towards India rather than Russia, both because he had no faith in Russian promises, and considered that the Soviet was heading towards bankruptcy, and because he was anxious about the effects of Bolshevik propaganda and unwilling on that account to increase the number of Russians in the country. At the same time, the Amir no doubt hoped to arouse the more active interest of the British Government by admitting wider Russian co-operation.&apos; Sir F. Humphrys remarked that in recent, months he liad on several occasions deflected the Amir and his Foreign Minister from discussion of the subject of a new Anglo-Afghan treaty. He thought this question could not be postponed indefinitely unless the Amir realised that the British Government were prepared to give him help beyond the lerms of the present treaty as a reward for neighbourly conduct and to show their appreciation of his difficulties. Sir F. Humphrys concluded by recommending that the policy of the &quot; subsidy in kind&quot; should be approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government before the Amir&apos;s attitude on the North-West Frontier ceased to be correct and before he lost heart and committed himself too far m responding to the advances of the Soviet Government. The Government of India, m commenting on Sir F. Humphrys&apos; telegram, expressed the view that the crucial question at present was what, if anything, could be done to help the Amir to restore his own stability. The Amir&apos;s instability was in their view due largely to financial stringency, and this was in turn the result of the Ainir&apos;s reforms schemes at home and abroad, which had involved great expenditure on themselves and still greater expenditure on the suppression of the rebellion of which they were the main causa Unless, therefore, the Amir dropped some of his reforming zeal and modified his policy, the root-cause of the trouble would remain, and the British Government coukt in anv case do no more than supply palliatives.   The Government of India were not
prepared at present to commit themseLves to the &quot;subsidy in kind &quot; as a general, policy. In its aspect as a means of diverting the Amir from a dangerous rapproche-ment with Russia it would be hard to regard it otherwise than as a form of blackmail, to be applied first to one side and then to the other indefinitely. They were, however, prepared to make a single gift to the Amir, of the value of not more than about Rs. 5 lakhs (33,000Z.), \vith_ the double object (i) of impressing the Amir with our goodwill and possibly diverting his attention from his dangerous neighbours in the north, and (ii) of impressing the tribes with the feeling that we are definitely on the side of peace with the Amir and a continuous stable central Government.Sir F. Humphrys, on receiving the Government of India&apos;s views, again urged the acceptance of the policy of a &quot;subsidy in kind.&quot; &quot;The present nationalist and conciliatory policy of the Soviet in Central Asia,&quot; he said, &quot;appears to me a dangerous development, and the Russians are taking advantage of the Amir&apos;s poverty to offer him material support in return for concessions calculated to forward their propaganda. It is in the insidiousuess of the Russian penetration of Afghanistan that I see permanent menace to the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and my recommendation of the early acceptance of the principle of assistance in kind is made primarily with a view to putting up a permanent counter against this growing danger.&quot; He laid it down as axiomatic that the grant of any assistance in kind, if asked for, should be in the mutual interests of India and Afghanistan, and should be preceded by a period of correct neighbourly behaviour. He urged that if such a policy were ruled out on the ground that it amounted to blackmail and started an -auction with Russia, and Russia were thus given a monopoly of granting substantial favours to the Amir in return for consideration, &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government must be prepared for the risk of the eventual dismemberment of Afghanistan, resulting in the approach of Russia a step nearer India.&quot; &quot;Under the existing Russo-Afghan treaty,&quot; he continued, &quot; the Soviet Government budget for an annual expenditure on Afghanistan of 100,000?., excluding gifts in kind, and a sum of 50,000Z. a year which is understood to be provided for propaganda. If, therefore, I am to be in a position to combat this campaign, 1 consider it essential to have behind me the knowledge that an annual sum of approximately Rs. 7 lakhs (47,000/-.) is available for assistance in the internal development of Afghanistan. The fact of this appropriation would not, of course, be communicated to the Afghan Government, but would enable me to show a sympathetic attitude towards reqttests which fulfilled the conditions mentioned above. At present I am compelled to discourage all such discussions owing to the absence of a policy.&quot; Sir F. Humphrys concluded : &quot; If I have failed to make good my case for a policy, the implicit object of which, is to prevent the Amir committing himself too far with the Russians, I suggest that some practical alternative for dealing with this urgent problem be examined.&quot; The Government of India adhered to their view that it was unnecessary and undesirable at present to go beyond their previous proposal, which was, in effect, putting Sir F. Humphrys&apos; policy on trial for one year.On the 13th May, Sir F. Humphrys reported that at an interview on the preceding day the Afghan Foreign Minister had put forward four definite requests for assistance in the internal development of Afghanistan : (1) The free technical education of Afghan youths in England.(2) The sale at concession rates, or, preferably, the free gift, of rifles, ammunition, and guns.(3) Assistance in the re-alignment and construction of the Kabul-Khyber road. (4) The free gift of machinery for cloth, soap, and sugar factories in Kabul.The Afghan Foreign Minister put No. (2) first in order of preference and No. (3) second.Various objections were seen by both Sir F. Humphrys and the Government of India to Nos. (1), (2) and (4); but the Government of India expressed their willingness-to give the Afghan Government expert assistance in regard to the survey and re-alignment of the road (No. 3). They added : &quot; We feel it will be essential at this, -stage so to define our assistance over the actual construction as to keep within the limits of our proposed gift this year and to commit us in no way to a similar gift hereafter.&quot; (Sir F. Humphrys had pointed out that the work, if carried through properly, would occupy some years, and involve recurring grants, which need not, however, exceed Rs. 6 or 7 lakhs annually.)
The general conclusions of the Government of India were embodied on the 30th May in a telegraphic appreciation of the present situation in Afghanistan, which it will be desirable to quote practically in full: &quot; Its two outstanding features,&quot; they said, &quot; are the instability of Amanulla&apos;s personal position and. the markedly sudden growth of Russian penetration. The main cause of the former is Amanulla&apos;s fanatical reformation zeal, which has brought him into conflict with orthodox conservatism and vested interests. He has had a very sharp lesson, but his overwhelming vanity is apparently preventing his taking it to heart. He seems now unpopular throughout the country, and there is a general idea abroad that he is an unsound Muslim, a man who is selling his country to the foreigner and one who is unlikely to last. The stoning of Ahmadis, the violation of safe conducts, and the wholesale execution of rebels, all of which might have added to the strength of an Abdur Rahman, are unlikely to strengdreu the position of his grandson who is aping modern civilisation.&quot; As regards the Russian menace, it is at first sight difficult to stand out against the suspicion that the Russians are set on Amanulla&apos;s downfall and the disintegration of Afghanistan. Nevertheless, such evidence as is available does not bear it out . . . The conclusion is forced on us that, for the moment at any rate, the Russians feel that it is to their interest to support the Central Government.&quot; Apart from the probability of their being influenced by the suspicion that Great Britain is anti-Amanulla, their line of argument is probably something like this : Our aim is against India, or rather, against Great Britain through India. If Amanulla falls and Afghanistan is reduced to chaos, it might not be difficult for us to get up to the Hindu Rush, but, as for India, it might be further off than ever. What suits our book is not general - chaos, in which our efforts against and towards India would be dissipated, but an organised Afghanistan (not necessarily an Amirate for long) which, at our bidding, will stir up the frontier tribes and act as a forwarding agency, with all the authority of an independent Muslim State, for our propaganda and activities in India.&quot; Afghanistan&apos;s attitude towards Russia seems to be one of sheer grab, her dominant idea being to extract as much from Russia as possible at the expense of as few concessions as possible. The Amir probably dislikes the flooding of Afghanistan Avith so much Russian personnel. Some of it, however, he is glad to have, e.g., Russian aviators, though it seems hard to believe that he intends their presence to be other than temporary until Afghans are trained,, or nationals of other countries than England and Russia can be entertained. There is evidence that, in the north at any rate, Russians are regarded with suspicion and hampered by restrictions. But even here it is likely enough that the Amir&apos;s indomitable vanity prevents him from seeing the dangers clearly.il It; is possible, as Humphrys said in his treaty despatch, that &apos;it is familiarity which breeds, in the Afghan mind, if not contempt, at least fear and aversion, and that the best antidote to Bolshevik propaganda in Kabul is close and constant association with the Bolsheviks themselves.&apos; Certainly this influx of Russians is likely to prove even more distasteful to Afghans generally than the influx of Italians and Germans, and it is possible that the situation in this respect has only to become a bit worse for it to clear up.&quot; But the situation is at present so fluid that there is much to be said for-deferring the taking of a definite decision on future policy. Ministers cure does not seem adequate for serious character of diagnosis. If there is real danger of Russians by means of their gifts, coupled with the influx of their personnel, obtaining a predominant position in the country in spite of our own policy of friendliness, then an occasional gift from us to the annual value of some 7 lakhs of rupees could do little to obstruct the  ^1*0 YV til 0 ^ menace. As likely as not, the Amir would use the dole to spur the Russians on to further gifts. Hence, if Humphrys&apos; diagnosis is right, as it may well be, we shall be forced, however much against our will, to scrutinise anew the old proposals for exclusive or semi-exclusive treaties and the like, which we had hoped we had discarded for ever. Certainly a policy more heroic than the suggested yearly tip will be needed.   To regard the latter as a policy in itself,.
instead of merely as the oiling of the machinery of our existing policy of scrupulous treaty observance and neighbouring and friendly relations, might lull us into false security.&quot; In short, until the situation becomes clearer, our best plan will be to institute one year&apos;s instalment of the Minister&apos;s policy and watch developments carefully.   But, even so, it is all-important that our gift should take a form unprovocative to the Afghans at large, lest we become associated in the popular mind with the great odium now attaching to Amanulla&apos;s reforms.&quot; The facts in regard to the first  &quot;outstanding  feature&quot; mentioned by   the Government of India, viz., the instability of Amanulla&apos;s personal position, will have been made sufficiently clear by the foregoing summary.   Some further explanation is desirable with reference to the second, viz.,  &quot; the markedly sudden growth of russian penetration,&quot; and it will perhaps be useful in this connection to sketch briefly the general course of Russo-Afghan relations in recent years.As has already been mentioned, a Russo-Afghan treaty was signed at Moscow in February 1921, and ratified by the Amir in the following August. The published text provided, among other things, for the establishment of Russian Consulates at Kandahar and Ghazni, for the handing over to Afghanistan (subject to arrangements for ascertaining the wishes of the population) of &quot; the frontier districts which belonged to her in the last century &quot; (i.e., the Panjdeh area), and for &quot; financial and other help &quot; to Afghanistan, including a yearly subsidy of one million roubles in gold or silver, the construction of a telegraph line from Kushk, vid Herat and Kandahar, to Kabul, and the provision of &quot;technical and other specialists.&quot; It is believed that an unpublished addendum to the treaty added a further explicit promise to the Afghans of military supplies: rifles, aeroplanes, anti-aircraft guns and a powder factory.The Russian fulfilment of their treaty promises was not very satisfactory; the subject is, in fact, believed to have been a source of continuous bickering between the two Governments. The Afghan failure (in accordance with the undertaking given in connection with the Anglo-Afghan treaty) to allow Russian Consulates at Ghazni and Kandahar was made the excuse for not handing over at once the military stores promised by the unpublished addendum to the treaty ; the subsidy fell into arrears and was only forthcoming in driblets, and nothing at all was, or even now has been, done to give effect to the clause providing for the restoration of the Panjdeh territory to Afghanistan. The powder factory also still awaits construction, and it is not clear from our information whether a commencement has yet been made with the Kushk-Kabul telegraph line, which has been held up until quite recently by a dispute between the two Governments as to which should pay for the poles. On the other hand the promised arms are believed to have been delivered in the end (some 7,500 rifles, 12 million rounds of ammunition, and 12 guns). The subsidy appears still to be in arrears ; it is not clear whether more than one year&apos;s subsidy has yet been paid.The development of tbe Russian connection has been particularly marked in connection with the Afghan &quot; Air Force.&quot; Our available information as to aeroplanes leaves some doubt as to the exact position. It was believed that a gift of \&apos;d aeroplanes was promised by the Russians in connection with their treaty. One or two machines were apparently presented at once and have been lying useless ever since. Four more were reported to be on the way by road some months ago. More important is the fact that live effective machines (four British-made service aeroplanes and one passenger machine) were delivered at Kabul by air in October last, with a staff of Russian aviators, who seem subsequently to have become in effect the Afghan &quot;Air Force.&quot; (There is also still a Uerman pilot, and Afghans are under training in Russia.) According to- report, the Russians had proposed to make a gift to the Afghans of these aeroplanes, on condition that the Afghan Government would employ Russian pilots, and that the road from Mazar-i-Sharif to Kabul would be made fit for motor traffic ; but in the end the Afghans appear to have paid for the machines. (The Afghan Government, it will be remembered, had previously bought two-aeroplanes from the Government of India, which had been delivered in August.)It is impossible from our information to trace precisely the increase of Russian personnel iii Afghanistan. There was a Russian Minister at Kabul before the Russo-Afghan treaty was concluded, and has been ever since. It appears from an incidental reference that in March there were 15 Russians altogether in the &quot;Air Force.&quot;&apos; -Some 20 or 30 Russians were apparently to be brought into Afghanistan (but not presumably to Kabul at present) for work on the Kushk-Kabul telegraph line. A report of February mentions that four Russians had arrived at Kandahar with baggage said to consist of a complete field wireless set presented by the Soviet
Government. According to a telegram from Sir F. Humphrys, dated the 15th May there will shortly be over 70 Russians in Kabul, including women. &apos;Recent reports as to Russo-Afghan relations include the following, which may hequoted for what they are worth, though they cannot be accepted without reserve ;_(1) that the Soviet authorities approved in April a  proposal to suppR the-Afghans with armoured cars, aeroplanes and military equipment to the value of 8  million gold roubles, in addition to 17^- million gold roubles&apos; worth already supplied since August last, 20 millions of the purchase price to be funded       long-term debt ; (2) that the Afghans were about the same time pressing the Soviet Government to pay them the subsidy up to the end of 1925, and to give them 50,000 rifles 150,000,000 rounds of ammunition, 36 field guns, 36 mule guns and 200 or 300 machine guns, and apparently 12 aeroplanes ; also to press on with the construction of the powder factory ; (3) that at a recent Russo-Afghan conference at Baden a new Russian draft treaty was presented to the Afghan delegate, who forwarded it to Kabul. This draft is alleged to provide that &quot; each State must oppose with all its forces any foreign policy directed against the other &quot; ; also for the gift to-Afghanistan of 10,000 rifles, three field batteries, two aeroplanes, and one gas equipment, for a Russian loan to Afghanistan, and for the establishment by Russia of military academies at Kabul, Kandahar and Balkh. The last report is very dubious, and awaits the result of further investigations. The others are also open to doubt, particularly (1).   It seems probable that, if there is any truth in this, the figures are greatly exaggerated.   There is nothing inherently improbable in the report that the Afghans are making the requests in (2;, generous though the scale of their alleged demands is.It is perhaps unnecessary to deal at any length with the bearing of Russo-Afglian developments on British interests and policy. The Soviet policy of concentration for the present on the east and attack on Great Britain through India is a common-place. Soviet activities and designs in Afghanistan, of which the plan to establish Russian Consulates in Eastern Afghanistan was one illustration, formed &quot; the most serious charge&quot; in the note presented to the Soviet Government in September 1921 in connection with their failure to carry out their obligations under the Trade Agreement. Similarly, in the memorandum presented to the Soviet Government in May 1923 attention was drawn to the fact that M. Raskolnikov, the then Soviet representative in Kabul, had &quot; distinguished himself by exceptional zeal&quot; in promoting anti-British activities, and specific references were given to intrigues with the frontier tribes. Within the last two or three months evidence has been received pointing to the conclusion that the present Russian Minister at Kabul is intriguing with, and supplying funds to, the colony of Hindustani fanatics at Chamarkand, on the North-West Frontier, a notorious centre of anti-British activities.One recent development of Soviet policy in Central Asia that should perhaps be specially mentioned is the redistribution on the lines of ethnological division of the territories lying along the northern frontiers of Persia and Afghanistan. The suggestion is that these new provinces, constituted on the basis of racial unity, will exercise an attractive influence on the populations of the same races lying on the Persian and Afghan side of the frontier, and thus facilitate the further advance of Soviet influence at the expense of the integrity of Persia and Afghanistan. It is possibly significant in this connection that the area in Badakhshan, in which a &quot;local insurrection&quot; was recently reported, adjoins Russian Shignan, and appears to be within the area ethnologically related to the Tajik &quot;autonomous province&quot; recently set up on the Russian side. Sir F. Humphrys mentioned that it was reported that Russian agents had -been exhorting Afghan subjects living in the neighbourhood of the border not to pay their land revenue this year. It is of interest to note in this connection that the Persian Minister at Kabul called on Sir F. Humphrys on the 31st May to draw his attention to the fact that, in the view of the Persian Government, the increasing activity of Bolshevik propaganda in Khorasan and Northern Afghanistan constituted a very urgent danger threatening the joint interests of Great Britain, Persia and Afghanistan. Sir F. Humphrys suggested that the Persian Minister should communicate these apprehensions to the Amir, which he promised to do.&apos;9th June 1925.    ;
