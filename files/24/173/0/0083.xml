JSECRET. CP.281(55)CABINET.COMMITTEE OF HOME AFFAIRS. EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) BILL.*4Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.The purpose of this Bill (which is virtually identical with one which passed the Lords and was read a second time in the Commons in 1923) is to make certain minor amendments on the Education (Scotland) Acts, 1908 and 1918.      If it can hardly be described as urgent,  it is being strongly and unanimously pressed for by the Education Authorities, who are convinced tac,t it would be non-contentious.     In the circumstances, I think it ought at least to be introduced.Clause 1.     Education Authorities, with the sanction of the Department, can now close.a transferred denominational school after ten years,  if it is no longer required.     Under the Bill closure may take place at any time, provided the representatives of the transferring body consent.Clause 2.     At present all Education AuthorI-ties must meet once a month.      Henceforward in the High-land Cotmties, where meetings are very costly, a yearly minimum of six would suffice.Clause 5.      Serious administrative friction has been caused in many areas as the result of an eleventh hour amendment to the 1918 Act, the effect of which was to confer special powers upon certain School Management Committees.      The clause puts all these Com-mittees on an equal footing.Clause 4.     Where the population is scattered, it is sometimes less costly to bring the children to a school than to bring a school to the children.      The existing Statutes give power to pay for conveyance pro-vided the parents cannot do so.      The clause removes the proviso, but stipulates that the Department must be satis-fied that the scheme of conveyance as a whole will be less expensive than the erection and maintenance of a separate school.Clause 5.     An amendment accepted in 1918 at the Report Stage gave Education Authorities unnecessarily wide powers in regard to paying for the education of children outside their own areas.      Clause 5 restricts these powers to cases of mental and physical defect.&quot;J.G.&quot;Scottish Education Department, 8th June,  1925.f&quot;(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY of HIS BRIT ACETIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )
