CONFIDENTIAL Li BRAHMS 0 8-his document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government), .CABINET. HOME AFFAIBS COMMITTEE. 3 0FACTORIES    BILL.Report of the Inter-Departmental Conference.iAt the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee onI24th April  (H.A.C.  10th Conclusions  (25)) it was decidedIthat the Factories Bill should be further considered by an Inter-Departmental Conference.      This has been done and the Report of the Conference is circulated herewith.IW.J.H.I,280(25).!!8th June,   1925.
REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE CALLED TOGETHER AT THE REQUEST OF THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TO GIVE FURTHER CONSIDERATION TO THE FACTORIES BILL.The Inter-Departmental Conference which was convened by the Home Secretary at the instance of the Home Affairs Committee to give further consideration to the Factories Bill, beg to submit the following report.    In doing so, we wish to state that we have, as requested by the Home Affairs Committee, borne in mind that the Government desire to introduce a Bill whioh must be on the one hand effective and on the other hand must not impose too heavy a burden on trade and industry.We have made no attempt to survey the Bill as a whole, but have confined our attention to those clauses which, notwithstanding the amendments made in the revised Bill, appear prima facie likely to impose a burden on industry and to which the criticisms of the government Departments affeoted have been directed. We have not, however, dealt with the Clauses relating to hours of employment as these involve questions of general policy.   We will deal seriatim with the clauses which we have discussed.Clause 2(b).&quot;The floor of every workroom shall be thoroughly cleansed, at least onoe a week.&quot;This requirement has been critioised on the ground that it will impose generally an additional charge on industry and that, in certain special oases, effeot could only be given to it, if at all, at considerable expense.    It was represented that the word Cleansed1 normally connoted a process involving the use of soap and water, that the thorough application of such a process once a -week was going beyond the present general praotioe and was in many instances unnecessary.On the other hand, the experience of the Factory Department of the Home Office strongly supports the view that the existing requirement in the Factory and Workshop Act,  1901,  that every faotory &quot;must be kept in a cleanly state&quot; is not sufficiently definite and is difficult to enforce.    It was also pointed out that the main objection taken by employers to the requirements in the corresponding Clause in the Labour Government Bill was that the prooess of cleansing should take place &quot;at a time when work is not going on in the room&quot; j    that these words had been omitted and that it was not anticipated that there would be any serious opposition to the Clause in its present form.We have come to the conclusion that any strengthening of the present requirement will no doubt involve in additional expense those employers who have up to the present neglected to keep their faotory floors clean;   and that the requirement in the Bill leaves some room for doubt as to the standard which it is intended should be reached.    On the other hand, we are agreed that the requirement that the cleaning process should be carried out at regular intervals should be retained.    We consider that the process of cleaning whioh should be required to be oarried out in any particular factory should be the prooess appropriate to the Particular industry.    The words &quot;thoroughly cleansed&apos; suggest more than this, and we recommend that the word &quot;cleaned1 should be used instead.
It was explained that the Factory and Workshop Aot,  1901 requires a minimum cubic space of 250 feet per person and that! in accordance with the decision of the Home Affairs Committee it w&amp;s not now proposed in the Bill to make any alteration so far as existing factories were concerned, understandthat it is the present general practice in modern building to make allowance for a cubic space of at least 400 ft. per person and we do not think^ therefore, that the Clause, as it now appears,  will impose any restriction or burden on industry.Clause 3(4).&quot;if the Inspector for the District so requires, there shall be affixed in the workroom a noticespecifying the number of persons who ...........may be employed in that room.&quot;It was objected that the Clause left it to the Inspector to decide whether the notice referred to need or need not be affixed, and that consequently occupiers would, until the Factory Inspector had given his decision, remain uncertain as to their obligation.    It was pointed out that under the existing law the notice in question was required to be posted in all factories, and that the present provision was in the nature of a relaxation to meet special cases.    In view of these explanations, the objection was withdrawn.    We do not, therefore,  recommend any change.Clause 4(1).&quot;Effective measures shall be taken for securing and maintaining a reasonable temperature in each workroom, and the measures so taken shall be such as not to allow the escape of any injurious or offensive fumes into the air of any workroom.In every workroom in which a substantial part of the work is done sitting, the temperature shall not, after the first hour m which work is going on,  be allowed to fall below 60 degrees.It was explained that,  in accordance with the decision of the Home Affairs Committee, the corresponding clause in the Bill introduced by the Labour Government had been altered with a view to reducing the cost of compliance:    the words &quot;during the whole time that work is going on&quot; had been omitted from the first sentence of the first paragraph of the clause and the words &quot;after the first hour&quot; had been inserted in the second paragraph.These amendments satisfied the criticisms which had been received from Government Departments and no further observations were offered.Clause 6(3).&quot;All glazed windows and skylights of workrooms shall,  so far as practicable, be kept clean on both the inner and outer surfaces and free from obstruction.We were informed that this provision gives effect to a recommendation of the Factory Lighting Committee.    It was urged that, from tho point of view of the health&quot;      .    a factory shall be deemed to be ... overcrowded if the amount of cubic space in anv workroom allows for every person employed in the room,  in the case of a room constructed or converted for use as a workroom before the passing of this Aot, less than 250 cubic feet, or in the case of any other room, less than 400 cubic feet, and in calculating the amount of cubic spaco in any room hot constructed or converted for use as a workroom before the passi of this Act,  no space more than 14 feet from the floor shall be taken into account.
atid safety of the worker, the clause was of great importance and that if the Bill was to be effective, a provision on thuse lines was necessary.It has,  on the other hand,  been represented that the words &quot;so far as practicable&quot; do not indicate sufficiently clearly the class of oases which it is intended should be excluded from the operation of the Clause, and it was pointed out that though the oleaning of the inner suffaces of skylights was practicable in the sense that it was possible of achievement, the cost of the operation would in a -number of oases be almOst prohibitive.We addept the view that this Clause is necessary to the Bill and we have come to the ccnslusion that it should be retained without amendment.    We do not think that any attempt should be made to define more clearly the obligation imposed because though greater precision might mitigate hardship in certain instances, it would create hardship in others.    We were, however, assured that, when the Clause comes to be enforced and the question of practicability is under consideration,  full account will be taken of the cost involved.Clause 14(2).&quot;Efficient devices or appliances shall be provided in any room or place in which work is carried on so as to stop promptly the transmission machinery in that room or place..It was urged that from the point of viow of protecting the worker against accident and of mitigating the effects of accident, this requirement is of the first importance.    We were informed that stopping devices are provided in eaoh room in the Cotton Bleaching, Dyeing and Printing Industry in virtue of an agreement entered into between the employers,  operatives and the Home Office and that they are also already provided in most modern factories in other industries. It was also pointed out that in factories not so equipped, which are driven by electricity or use steam driven transmission machinery on the unit system, the installation of such appliances oould be carried out at comparatively little cost.On the other hand,  it was represented that the cost of compliance would be considerable in a number of factories equipped with old plant.We accept the view that &quot;the clause is necessary,  but we feel it our duty to point out that it could not, in our opinion, be made effective in certain cases without imposing a charge on industry&quot;Clause 15(l).&quot;Every dangerous part of any machinery, other than primemovers and transmission machinery, shall either be securely fenced or be in such position or of such construction as to be safe to persons employed or working.on the premises as it would be ir securely fenced:&quot; *It was objected that the words &apos;dangerous machinery1 were too indefinite and that employers would not readily grasp the extent of the obligation imposed upon them.    On explanation being given, however, that the Clause re-enacts the requirement in the Act of 1901 (Seotion 10(c)), with the language of which employers were now familiar, and that no difficulty had been experienced in enforcing that requirement,  the objection was withdrawn.    We do not accordingly propose any change.
&quot;Where there is available for use in oonneotion with machinery of any class; any safety device which(a; makes it impossible to expose a dangerous part of maohmery whilst in motion; or   &apos;(b) stops a machine forthwith in case of danger, tho Seoretary of State may by order direct that any such device shall be provided for use in connexion with such class of machinery as may be specified in the order.&quot;It was feared that this Clause would impose a charge on industry if the only safety device on the market for any particular class of machinery were expensive either to buy or to instaljand it was suggested that after the word &quot;available&quot;, the words &quot;without serious prejudice to output or cost&quot;  should be inserted.We do not think that this amendment is desirable.    It was pointed out that the provision of safety devices will only be required in cases where an order to that effect is made by the Secretary of State and that the users of any class of machine affected would be consulted before an order was made.    We understand that when Regulations under the Factory and Workshop Aot are drafted, the question of cost is always taken into account and would be considered as a matter of course in connection with orders under this Clause.    Further, if words relating to cost were inserted in this Clause, attempts would be made to move in similar words on other Clauses.It was suggested, in view of the fact that automatio safety devices have already been adopted in various trades in pursuance of agreements between employers, operatives and the Home Office,  that further agreements on similar lines might be entered into with other analogous trades, and the clause omitted from the Bill. This suggestion does not appear to us to be adequate.    It might not be possible to negotiate agreements with the Trades in which the use of automatic guards was specially desirable.    Further, it is only in the case of highly organised industries that voluntary agreements -oan fully be carried into effect.    The agreements have no binding force in themselves.We have come to the conclusion that the Clause should be rotained,  but we think that the orders applying the provisions should be Special Orders, which are required (a) to be published in draft before being made, and (b) when made, to be laid before both Houses of Parliament for 40 days.    If the above proposal is adopted,  employers concerned will have a formal assurance that opportunity will be given them for lodging objections.Clause 15(4).&quot;Any part of any material or article whioh is dangerous while in notion in any machine shall, if praoticable, either be securely fenced or be in such a position as to be safe to any person employed or working on the premises as it would be if securely fenced.&quot;^It was objected that the requirement lost in precision by the use of the words &quot;if practicable&quot;, and it was suggested that the obligation should be made absolute, as in the case of Clause 16, and the subsection incorporated with subsection (1).    it was, however pointed out that the fencing of projecting bars on hollow spindle lathes^ which this provision was designed     inter alia - to secure, was not in all cases practicable and that this subseotion could not fairly be compared with the provisions of Clause 16, since that Clause applied only to new machinery and considerations of practicability did not arise.    In these circumstances tho objection was withdrawn and we do not propose any change-
&quot;All spur and other gearing shall be completely encased so as not to be exposed.&quot;It was suggested that the wording was too comprehensive and that it should be limited to all &quot;spur and other toothed or friction gearing&quot;.    We agree and recommend that the necessary alterations in the Clause should be made.Clause 24(2).&quot;A person shall not be employed or work at any place which is more than 12 feet from the ground, unless either the place is one which affords secure foothold, and, when necessary secure handhold, or adequate means are provided by fencing or otherwise to ensure his safety.It was represented that this Clause might be held to prevent the employment of men,  suoh as ship riggers, in precarious positions.    It was pointed out that a ship&apos;s mast did not afford secure foothold or handhold to a man working up or down it and that the provision of other means,  such as a lifeline, for securing the worker&apos;s safety would not be practicable in that partioular case.It was explained that the clause was not intended to apply to -work of that kind for which men of special experience would be employed - and that the proposed provision was an important one in view of the high proportion of accidents due to falls - but the force of the above criticism was recognised and we think that the Clause should be further considered.Clause 29(l).&quot;Every air receiver which forms part of an air compressing plant shall be provided with a suitable manhold, handhole,  or other means which will allow the interior to be thoroughly cleaned.&quot;It was objected that it was not possible to fit certain types of small receivers with either manholes or handholes.    It was pointed out, however, that small receivers   could be cleaned out,  by means of steam or otherwise, through the openings left to receive the fittings, and that such openings would constitute &quot;other means&quot; within the terms of the Clause.    This objection was accordingly withdrawn and we do not propose any change.Clause? 32(5)(b).&quot;In any faotory or part of a factory where more than 20 persons are employed above the ground floor or where any explosive or highly inflammable material is handled or stored, there shall be conduoted in the prescribed manner at least once in every 3 months a Tire drill,  in which all the occupants of the faotory or of any part thereof shall take part.&quot;A number of objections have been urged against this Clause.    It has been represented that it would result in the continuity of the work being seriously interrupted, that the loss of four half-days&apos; work a year was a serious burden to lay on industry, that compensation in the case of piece workers for time lost would prove a cause of friction as well as expense, that in the case of buildings constructed of non-inflammable material, the requirement was unnecessary, that the Clause would, as drafted,  require all the employees in a building to take part in the drill,  even though the vast majority might be employed on the ground floor and that in Explosive Factories, fire drills involving the immediate evacuation of a building and the abandonment of inconpleted processes, might prove a positive danger.    It was also doubted
whether four fire drills a year were suffioient, in view of the constantly changing personnel, to secure that the workers would be adequately trained.On the other hand, we were informed that the requirement is based on a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Fire Brigades, and that the Commission had had factories mainly in mind when making this recommendation.    The Commission were, we understand,  strongly of opinion that fire drill did much to minimise the- risk of panic which was of the essence of the fire problem.    Further, it was pointed out that even in buildings the materials of ^hich would not generate a fierce fire, the smoke risk is always present and that all persons employed in a building, however they may be distributed about it,  should be trained in their fire duties since, in the event of fire, the whole building would have to be evacuated.We understand that the loss of life due to fire in industrial establishments has been very small in the aggregate,  but that the cases which occur are often very distressing and public feeling is strongly aroused.    On the whole, we are inclined to suggest that the application of the provision should be confined to factories,  other than Explosive Factories under the Control of Government Departments and faotories licensed under the Explosive Aots, in which highly inflammable or dangerous material is handled or Btored and to other faotories in which more than 20 women or young persons are employed above the first floor or more than 20 feet above the ground.Clause 57.&quot;There shall be provided for the use of all persons employed adequate and suitable facilities for washing conveniently situated, which shall be maintained in good order and repair.Strong objection has also been taken to this Clause.    It has been represented that it will impose a heavy charge on industry both in respect of the initial outlay involved and,  especially if soap and towels are required to be provided, of the recurrent cost;    that the expenditure will be largely waste expenditure as it has been found by experience that washing facilities when provided are not generally used, and that in many of the cleaner industries the requirement is unnecessary.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the provision of washing facilities would not impose any burden either on the many industries in which such provision is already compulsory under Regulations or Welfare Orders,  or on the large number of employers who are already making provision of this nature voluntarily;    and that though it might be the case that to a considerable extent the provision made is not used, there is a proportion of the workers who appreciate it.    Further, in most factories a number of workers remain on the premises for meals and it was urged that it is very desirable that workers should be able to &apos;?ash before taking food, however clean the nature of their occupation.We were also informed that criticism of the corresponding Clause in the Labour Government&apos;s Bill was directed,  not so much to the general proposition that washing facilities should be provided,  but to the standard to which employers would have been required to conform.    It was pointed out that no standard is laid down in the revised Bill.We have given careful consideration to all the arguments, but we are not in a position to make any definite recommendation.
Clause 40.&quot;There shall be provided and maintained suitable protective clothing for the use of every person who is exposed in the usual oourse of his employment to acids,  or to any noxious or offensive substance liable to cause injury to person or clothing,&quot;It has been represented that the word &quot;offensive&quot; does not indicate sufficiently clearly the range of substances which is intended should be covered and that application?&apos;!&quot;&quot; or the provision of protective clothing might, be made in cases where such provision was not necessary.    It was anticipated that in this way the Clause might become a oause of friction between employers and employed and might, if employers forbore in the interests of. peace,  from disputing such claims, place a considerable charge on industry.    It was accordingly suggested that the present procedure of requiring the provision of protective clothing by Welfare Order as and when occasion arises,  should be continued and this Clause omitted from the Bill.    It was pointed out,  on tho other hand, that there are a number of occupations in which the need for the provision of protective clothing could not be disputed and that years night elapse before all the industries concerned could be dealt with by Welfare 0rder*We think the difficulties might be got over, and the contending points of view reconciled, by defining more precisely the oases in which the requirement is to apply.    We propose,  therefore, that the Clause, instead of being of general application,  should be limited in scope to processes to be prescribed by the Secretary of Stato.    The burden on&apos; industry would in this manner, we think, be sensibly reduced and the present procedure for securing the provision cf protective clothing,  greatly expedited.77e have also discussed the difficulty which the application of this Clause,  read in conjunction with Clause 107, might cause in cases where by custom or Trade Agreement, the remuneration of the workers is adjusted to compensate them for the dirty or offensive nature of their occupation. If the proposal which we have made above is accepted, the payment of &quot;dirty money&quot; would, when the question of prescribing any process under this Clause arises, be one of the considerations taken into account.Clause 48(2).&quot;lN&quot;o internal combustion engine shall be used in any workroom unless it is&quot;so enclosed as to prevent any fumes from the engine entering the air of the room.This Clause has been criticised on two grounds;    that it is so widely drawn that it would prevent a motor vehicle from being driven into a shop and that it would require the occupier to take steps to remove net only the fumes from the engine exhaust but also such fumes as might escape due to leakage.&apos;   On both grounds the Clause   would, it was thought, prove burdensome to industry.In regard to the first point it was explained that the Clause was only intended tc apply to stationary engines.    In regtrd to the second, it was
urged that the gas generated by internal combustion engines - namely carbon monoxide - is one of the most deadly of industrial poisons and that the escape through leakage of only a very small quantity into the air is a source of danger-It was also pointed out that the use of small gas engines in factories in rural districts is increasing and that in such places the engines are frequently placed inside the workrooms.We have come to the conclusion that the Bill cannot be considered effective unless adequate provision against the danger of carbon monoxide is made;    but in order that any ambiguity due to the drafting of the Clause may be. removed and that its object may more readily be apprehended, we think that the wording should be modified so as to make it clear that it is only the escape of injurious fumes that is aimed at and that the clause only applies to stationary engines.Glause 98.every person paid by the piece who is employed in a factory or in the business of a factory outside the factory, whether directly by the occupier or by any contractor employed by him in connection with the factory,  shall, in order to enable him to compute the total amount of wages payable to him in respect of his work,  be furnished with particulars of his work and of the rate of wages applicable thereto .....It was objected that the provision was too rigid and it was pointed out that in many cases it was difficult to decide whether a worker was or wag not paid by the piece.We were, however, informed that this Clause is based partly on the Particulars Section - Section 116 - of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, which applies only to textile factories, and partly on Orders made under that Section extending its provisions to other industries;    that the section now applies to over a million workers;    that few, if any, difficulties of interpretation have, in practice, arisen and that the Clause has not been objeoted to- by the employers&apos; organizations.    It was also urged that the Clause would prove very valuable in removing what is now a frequent cause of friction and dispute in industries not subject to the present Particulars Section or to Particulars Orders,      namely the question whether a pieceworker has received his proper wago or not.In view of the foregoing considerations, the objection was withdrawn and we do not recommend any change.Clause 107.&quot;Save as otherwise expressly provided under this Act, the occupier of a factory shall not make any deduction from the sum contracted to be paid by him to any person employed or receive or allow any person in his employment to receive any payment from any such person in respect of anything to be dene or provided by the occupier in pursuance of this Act.It was represented that this Clause would make it obligatory on employers to pay their workers during the holidays given in pursuance cf Clause 72, andto debar employers from making any charge in respect of the provision of means of heating food in messrooros provided in pursuance of Clause 44*As regards the first point, it was stated that the Clause did not apply, but the Parliamentary Draughtsman would be asked to consider if there was any ambiguity.
We realise fully that,  whilst many of the proposed new provisions may not cost much as separate items, it may be objected that their cumulative effect in certain factories and industries will be serious-    Subject to the observations contained in this Report, we do not suggest that those provisions should be excluded from any Bill that proposed to bring the Factory Law into a satisfactory and up to date condition, but the consideration of cost will of course be weighed by the Government in determining their general attitude towards the Bill.1th June, 1925.G3-12.- As regards charging for services in messrooms,  it was pointed out that where occupiers are at present required in terms to furnish means of warming food and boiling   water in messrooms provided in pursuance of Welfare Orders,  Section 7(5) of the Police,  Faotories, &amp;o.  (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,  1916, already prohibits them from making any charge in respect of that service.    In these circumstances, we do not propose any change.
