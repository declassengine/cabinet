This dooument is the property of His Britannic Ma,iesty&apos;s Government.I oiroulate herewith (Appendix I)  the Report of the Committee whioh I recently appointed jointly with the Secretary for Scotland to consider the question of the continuance of the deductions from police pay and allowances which were made in 1922,  in pursuance  of recommendations of the Geddes Committee, together with a letter I have received from Lord Lee,   (Appendix II)., and,  in so doing I desire strongly to urge that effect should be given to the recommendation on which, the Committee have agreed.      The Secretary for Scotland coiiours,It will he desirable briefly to recapitulate the circumstances leading to the appointment of the Committee.In 19.19, at a time of considerable unrest in the Police on account of their conditions of service, a Committee, under the Chairmanship of Lord Desborough, was appointed to review the whole question.      The main recommendations of the Committee, which were adopted by the Government, were  (l) standard rates of pay and pensions for all forces,   (8) a scale  of pay for constables rising from 70/- to 90/- weekly, with long service increments bringing the scale to 95/-, subject to good conduct and efficiency,   (3) rent allowances assessed according to local conditions,   (4) the institution of  (a)  the Police Federation as a representative body for the police, and (b)  the Police Council as an advisory body, consisting of representatives of the police authorities and all ranks of the police,  for the consideration of questions of pay, etc. affecting the Police Service as a whole.In 1922 the Geddes Committee recommended certain savingsCABINET.289(25)POLICE    PAY.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.
in police expenditure, amounting to  1,800,000,  of which one half  ( 900,000)  would accrue to the Exchequer.      These were secured partly by administrative measures (mainly reductions in the strength of the forces) and partly by reductions in pay and allowances of the Police, mainly deductions from rent allowances at fixed rates and an all-round deduction of 2-?;; per cent from pay, producing about  560,000 and  3d0,000 respectively, with savings to the Exchequer of half these  &apos; amounts or  470,000 in all.      As explained in the Report of the Lee Committee, these &quot;cuts&quot; were assented to by the Police Councils of 1922 as an emergency measure for the year 1922-23,  and it was accordingly provided in the respective Police Regulations that they  should cease to apply as from 31st March,  1923,  for the English forces, and 30th April,  1923, for the Scottish forces, unless renewed by further regulation. They have in fact been continued by further Regulations for the years 1923-24 and 1924-25, against increasingly vehement protests from the Police.     At the Police Council held this year the representatives of the Police Federation were for the first time strongly supported in their protests by the representatives of the Chief Officers, mainly on the ground of the increasing unsettlement    being produced in their Forces by the continuance of the &quot;cuts&quot;, and, after repeated discuss-ions, which proved abortive except in so far as they showed the  strong desire on all hands to arrive at a lasting settle -ment of the questions at issue, we decided to appoint this Committee, which was in effect a joint sub-Committee of the Police Councils of England and Scotland, with Lord Lee as an independent Chairman.The main recommendation on which the Committee have unanimously agreed is that the &quot;cuts&quot; from rent allowances should be terminated, and that in lieu of the present temporary deduction of &amp;g- per cent from pay,  the statutory rateable deductions towards pensions under the Police
Pensions Act should he increased,  on a permanent footing, from 2-5- per cent to 5 per cent.      The financial effect would he an additional charge on the police funds aggregating about  560,000 half of which would be borne by the Exchequer, but the present temporary 2-jr per cent deduction would be converted to a permanent additional contribution towards the cost of pensions.I consider It essential to implement this agreement without delay.     My main reasons are the following:-(l)    There can be no doubt about the unsettlement created in the Police by the continuance of the temporary deductions:    it is becoming acute, and every one is agreed that it is essential to put the pay of the Police once more on a  settled footingn      This came cut strongly in. the proceedings of the Police Council and the Lee Committee;    see also- the letters from the Commissioners of the Metropolitan and the City Police which are attached (Appendix III), (2)    To increase the rateable deductions beyond the figure to whioh the menfs representatives have now agreed would involve a compulsory reduction of the pay of serving men, a policy which has been rejected in the case of the Army and the Navy, and would produce a state  of serious and,  I think,  legitimate, discontent,  the more so as the   -representatives of the men feel that they have gone to the utmost limit of concession  (and have undoubtedly acted with both courage and public spirit in so doing) and the police authorities,  on their part., have specifically repudiated in paragraph C of the Report any intention of suggesting interference with the conditions of serving men. beyond the terms now agreed. (3)    Even the police authorities themselves, anxious
as they are to avoid further burdens on the    rates, would, I believe, resent any repudiation of the agree-ment at whioh they have arrived,  on the ground that such a 3tep would stultify not only the efforts which have been made on this particular occasion to arrive at a lasting settlement but also the whole Police Council procedure, which has been so carefully built up and affords an invaluable means of dealing with all kinds of problems affecting the Police Service as a whole. It is true that the Police Service is expensive and that less generous terms than those recommended by the Desborough Committee, and accorded by the Government in 1919, might have served the requirements of the case;    but I am convinced that to go back on that settlement beyond the point reached by the Lee Committee in their agreement, as respects men who are already serving, would produce a degree of acute resentment and discontent which we cannot afford to Incur, and I there-fore strongly urge that the Secretary for Scotland, and I should be authorised to make the Committee&apos;s recommendation known and carry It into effect without delay.      The matter is urgent as the present Regulations imposing the &quot;cuts&quot; come to an   end in England as from the 30th instant  (in Scotland from 31st July), and the Police Council should meet and fresh interim-Regulations be made   (pending legislation) before that date .There remain the questions referred to in paragraph   8 of the Report:-(a) The representatives of the Police Authorities urged the review of the  standard scale  of pay for new entrants to the police and the introduction of an age limit to qualify for retirement on pension without medical certificate; (b) the representatives of the men urged the improvement of the existing scales of widows&apos;  pensions.      The question of
modifying the scale of pay for constables in their initial years of service has already been the subject of inquiries by sub-Committees of the English and Scottish Police Councils. These inquiries were somewhat inconclusive but served to show that even at the present rates of pay it is by no means easy to secure a suffioienoy of recruits of the right stamp to maintain the forces at a proper working strength.    The present proposal of the police authorities is more radical, and would amount to a review of the whole soale of pay,  such as    . I was contemplated in paragraph 58 of the Dosborough Committee&apos;s Report, on the ground of changed conditions, and the re-introduction of an age as well as a service qualification for pensions as regards future entrants to the Police.    These are matters whioh must be remitted to a Committee of enquiry, and any Committee appointed for this purpose should also be aske to consider the question of the improvement of the widows&apos; ponsicI should be strongly opposed, however, to enlarging the inquiry to include any question of the introduction of differential rates of pay for the respective forces.    As already mentioned,  the standardisation of police pay for the lower ranks was one of the main recommendations of the Desborough Committee.    The reasons for the recommendation are set out in full in the Committee&apos;s Report and may be summarised under two main heads(l) That equal pay is justified on the merits,  on the ground that while in the large City forces there are some duties,   (such as traffic control at busy points) which are particularly onerous, the County constable has,  on the average,  quite as much work and more responsibility than his City colleagueK . (2) That the differentiation whioh existed before 1919 was the most fruitful source of dissatisfaction and produced endless anomalies, because there is no
12th June, 1925.satisfactory line of demarcation between urban and rural forces.    Even in the Metropolitan Police District itself there are extensive areas which are purely rural, while most County forces are responsible for the policing of important urban areas.I think experience has certainly shown that the Desborough Committee were right in this recommendation:    it is strongly supported   by H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary, who are in the best possible position to judge of the work of the various forces, and I am satisfied that to go back on this recommendation would not only be wrong in principle but react disastrously on the Police Service.In conclusion, I wish to remind my colleagues of the political situation, particularly the activity of the Communists and the prospect of industrial troubles later in the year, and, in view of my responsibilities for the preservation of order, to say, with all the emphasis at my command,, that I regard it as essential to have a Police Force which Is contented and in good heart.    If the recommendation now agreed upon by the Lee Committee is not accepted the effect on the Police is bound to be such that I could only regard the situation with grave misgiving.W.J.H.
A P P E N D I X    I .REPORT OF THECOMMITTEE ON THE ECONOMY DEDUCTIONS PROM POLICE PAY AND ALLOWANCES AND THE RATEABLE DEDUCTIONS TOWARDS PENSIONS.To the Right Hon. Sir William Joynson-Hioks, Bart., LLP., His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for the Homo Department, and Lieut.-Col. the Right Hon. Sir John Giimour Bart., D.S.O., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Secretary for Scotland.Sirs,1,   We have the honour to present our Report on the questions whioh you referred to us with regard to the continuance of the deductions from Police Pay and Allowances and, in the alternative, the increase of the rateable deductions in respect of Police pensions under the Police Pensions Act,  1921.2. We met on 27th May, 28th May and gth June, with sessions both morning and afternoon on each day.      We have not found it necessary to call any witnesses to give oral&apos;evidence.3. The deductions which are the subject of our inquiry are (a) the deductions fron rent allowances (with corresponding charges for quarters) at the rate of 3s.6d, weekly for constables in England and 2s.3d. weekly for constables in Scotland   with higher rates for the higher ranks in each case;    and (b) the supplementary deductions from pay at the rate of 2jt per cent, applicable to all ranks, which were introduced in 19 22 as part of the measures taken by the Government tc secure certain reductions in Police expenditure recommended by the Geddes Committee.      They were imposed with the assent of tho respective Police Councils for England and Scotland for the financial year 19 22-23,  and it was accordingly provided in the respective Regulations that they should cease to apply as from 31st March, 1923,  for the English Forces and 30th April,   1923,  for the Scottish Forces, unless renewed by further Regulation.      They have in fact been continued by further Regulations for the years 1923-24 and 1924-25, but the dis-cussions on the subject at the successive Police Counoils have revealed an increasingly strong cleavage of opinion as between the representatives of tho Police Authorities on the one hand and the representatives of the police forces on the other.. 4.    When the matter came before the Police Counoils for England and Scotland which met this year? the representatives of all ranks of the Police pressed for the immediate discontinuance of all the deductions, while the representatives of the Police Authorities pressed for their continuance,      A suggestion was made that the deductions should be discontinued and the rateable deductions under the Police Pensions Act inoreased, but on this tho Councils were also unable to agree and the Secretary of State and the Secretary for Scotland respectively decided to continue the deductions for a further period tc 30th June next in the case of England and 31st July in the case of Scotland,  and to appoint the
present Committee in the hope that we might be able to find a solution which would be generally aooeptable.5.   At the outset of our deliberations we found that we wer* unanimously agreed as to the uncertainty and unsettlement created by the continuance of the deductions on a temporary footing and as to the impor-tanoo of reaching as soon as possible some lasting settlement of the questions at issue.      When,  however, we proceeded to consider the particular measures ta be taken to this end we found considerable differences of opinion between the representatives of the Police Authorities on the one hand and the members tf the police forces on the other, but eventually, after considering a number of alternative proposi-tie-ns, both sides have been able to agree upon the following recommenda-tion,  namely,  that the present deductions from rent allowances and the supplementary deduction from pay should be discontinued as from the date when the present Regulatiens oome to an end, and that the rateable deductions under Section 19 of the Police Pensions Act,  1921, should be increased from 2-J- per cent, to 5 per cent.     We further recommend that, pending the necessary legislation to give effect to the latter part of this recommendation, the supplementary deduction of gjr per cent, should be continued by Regulation with provisions similar to those contained in Section 20 of the Police Pensions Act as to the return of the deductions upon retirement or dismissal.6.    We do not think it necessary for us to include in this Report any detailed statement of the considerations whioh we have had to weigh   and the views which have been expressed upon them in the course of our delibera-tions, but we wish to add the following observations:-(i) The circumstances which we have had to consider are of greatcomplexity and are in many cases viewed&quot;from different standpoints by the Police Authorities and the members of the police forces respectively.     It is therefore not surprising that there should have been some considerable differences of opinion amongst us as to the proper course to adopt, and we wish to make it clear that in coming to an agreement upon tho above recommendation both sides feel that they have made  material   concessions,     These, however, are in their opinion,  justified in the general public interest as well as in the interests ef the parties who are more particularly concerned.(ii) One cf tho main considerations which has weighed with the Committee in arriving at the recommendation in paragraph 5, to increase the rateable deductions has been the admittedly high and increasing cost of pensions and the very small proportion of the cost which is covered by the men&apos;s contributions,   especially in the case of those who&apos; have retained the advantage of the 26 year pensions scale and have contributed,  for at any rate a part of their service,  on the basis cf the pre-1919 rates of pay.
7.    In the course of our discussions our attention was drawn to the fact that whereas in England the rent allowances paid to the police have been revised and are now sufficient t* cover the actual reasonable amounts paid by way of rent and rates by 80 per cent, of the members of the several forces, in Scotland the rent allowances only cover the rent and rates ef 26 per cent, of the men.     We s&apos;ee na reason for any distinction between the English and Scottish police in this matter where the circum-stanoes are similar and consider that, if the recommendation in paragraph 5 is given effect to, the conditions as to rent allowances in England and Scotland should bo assimilated.8.    We have further to mention two points on which representations were made in the course of our discussions, but with which we did not consider it within our competence to deal, namely,(i)    The representatives of the Police Authorities, while making it clear that they did    not wish to propose any modification of the existing rates of pay, allowances and pensions as affecting serving members of the police,  (apart from the increase in the rateable deductions&apos; on which we have been able to come to an agreement, as stated in paragraph 5),  urged that in view of tho change of conditions since the Desborough Committee reported and its main recommendations were adopted by the Government, the standard scales of pay should be reviewed as regards new entrants to the police, as provided for in paragraph 58 of the Desborough Committee&apos;s Report, and also as regards new entrants that the adoption of an age limit to qualify for retirement on pension without medical certificate should also be considered.(ii) The representatives of the police forces urged that some improvement should be made in the existing scale of pensions, allowances and gratuities for widows and children, under the Police Pensions Act, 1921.9. In conclusion we deaire to express our warm appreciation of the assistance we have received throughout our inquiry from our Secretary, Mr. J.H. Burrell of tho Home Office.We have the honour to be, Sirs,Your obedient Servants,LEE OF FAREHAH HENRY S.KEITHW. ANDERSON j,F. MOYLANG.A. A1TS0N GEO.STRANGEWAYSJ.I..I.

LETTER FROM VISCOUNT LEE OF FAREHAMt JUUB 10th.,  1925.My dear Seoretary of State,In submitting to you the Report of the Committee on Police Pay and Pensions, over which I have been presiding, I feel bound to emphasise that the agreement whioh we wore eventually able to reach was not attained without very great difficulty.As you will know well from previous experience, the conflicting interests represented on the Committee had for a long time past found themselves unable to adjust their differences or to accept any compromise between their widely divergent points of view.     In consequence, they arrived at the first meeting of the Committee not merely in an unyielding but somewhat impatient frame of mind, and they appeared, moreover, to be so rigidly bound by instructions from their constituent bodies that there seemed little, if any, prospect of bringing them to any agreed conclusion, or cf the Inquiry resulting in any improvement in the situation.     So much so was this the case that., at the end of the first two days, there appeared to be so little prospect of bringing the two sides together that it seemed doubtful whether anything could be gained by prolonging tho proceedings or keeping the Committee in being.     In view, however, of the extreme seriousness of the position, and the lamentable consequences which might result from a final breakdown of the negotiations, I deoided to adjourn the proceedings for a sufficient period to enable me to attempt, by personal interview and persuasion, to bring the two sides to adopt a less unyielding attitude.    ,In particular, I was anxious to give the Representa-tives of the Police Federation an opportunity for further reflection and consultation with their comrades outside, and I am glad to be able to report that the &quot;olive branoh&quot; which I was eventually able to produce at yesterday&apos;s meeting of the Committee, emanated mainly from them.       In the end, as you will see from the Report, the whole Committee (with the present exception of Lord Deramore, who unfortunately was unable to attend but whose &apos;agreement I confidently expect to attain) oame to a unanimous conclusion on the main issue.     At the same time, it must not be supposed that thoy did so, on the one side or the other, without muoh pressure? or without considerable misgivings&apos; as to the reception whioh would be accorded to the compromise by the Police Force, cn the one hand, and the Polioe authorities on the other.     They were, however, prepared to take full responsibility fortheir action, and. to fight to the best of their ability to secure anaoceptanoo of the Report which they have signed.The next step, of course, rests with you and the Government, and, so far as I and the Committee are concerned,  our labours are finished.     I would, however, venture to urge upon you most strongly, that the oompromise reached by the Committee should be accepted and implemented as it stands, and that this opportunity of a peaceful settlement (which I feel sure, after experiencing the atmosphere of the Committee, is not likely to recur) should not be allowed to slip.     In any case, I am convinced that no settlement of the question more favourable to the taxpayer or the ratepayer could possibly be reached by agreement, or, if imposed by compulsion, without exciting very bitter feelings throughout the Polioe Forces.Believe me.
LETTERS FROM THE COMMISSIONERS OF METROPOLITAN AND CITY POLICE.The Secretary of State, Home Office,Whitehall, S.W.1.Sir,It is my duty to bring to your notice, not only as Secretary of State for the Home Department but as the Statutory Police Authority for the Metropolis, the fact that there are very distinct signs of discontent in the Force by reason of the continuation of the outs imposed on tho recommendation of the G-eddes Economy Committee.I invited your attention to this subject in my letter of the 18th November 1924,  and made certain suggestions with a view to a settlement.Since then, as the outcome of discussion at the Police Council, a Committee was appointed by you to consider the question, and 1 gather that the proposals under consideration are as follows(l) To do away entirely with the Rent Aid cut;\2) (a) To make the present 5% cut permanent;    or(b) To Increase the present 5$ to a. higher rate of deduction.I have been at considerable pains during the last six weeks to arrive at the real feolings of the men, whose ideas on the subject have been steadily fanned to white, heat by oertain members of the Branoit Roarda, assisted of course by outside influences.     I have no hesitation In sayxng -that the efforts of these agitators have reduced a large number of even the older and saner men of the force to a state of exasperation against the Statutory Authority and against me for what they consider to be a laok of ability or dosire to put an end to the cuts which they were told were purely temporary.1 have, however, gleaned that a proportion of the foroe regards the subject from a wider point of view and would accept:-(l)   The abolition of the Rent Aid cut;    and(2)   A statutory order to make the 5$ deduction now in foroe a permanent one.I feel it my duty to inform you that, if this matter is not speedily settled on these or similar lines, I am of opinion that a serious situation will arise.I am,-Sir,Your obedient Servant, (8 gd. )    W. T. F.- HORWGOD. Commissioner of Police of Metropolis.NEW   SCOTLAND   YARD, 6th May,  1925.
CITY   POLICE   OFFICE, May 21, 1925..Dear Sir William,I hope you will excuse my sending you a line privately on a matter which I feel to be serious, but on which I have no evidence to justify an official representation, viz. with regard to the present &quot;cuts&quot; from police pay and rent-aid, and the suggested increase to pension contributions of the police.From many conversations with superior police officers, and members of my branch boards, I am satisfied that a very strong feeling of discontent and unrest is arising among the men, and. that the &quot;agitation&quot; element is again obtaining influence with those inclined to be loyal. The men say (and with truth) that they were definitely promised the Desborough scale of pay, a fixed scale of pension and a fixed contribu-tion towards that pension and that to deprive them of any part of what thoy were promised (and on the strength of which meny joined the service) is an absolute breach of faith, which is strongly condemned if practised by a trade union, and should not be contemplated by the Government. Personally I think the original scheme was extravagant (and, in the country districts quite unjustifiable).     But the reversal of it is another question.The appointment of the Committee of Enquiry has of course created more talk and uneasiness and I feel sure the question ought to be speedily settled in the interest o.f the efficiency and discipline of the London police, the most important section of the whole.It may be still possible, if tactful agreement with the men&apos;s representatives is attempted, to secure their consent to a 5j  deduction, it certainly would have been possible a month or two ago..    But 1 fear any attempt to force a deduction of any amount may lead to trouble.Please forgive me for thus intruding my opinion on you.Yours very truly,(Sgd.)    J.N. NOTT BOWER.
