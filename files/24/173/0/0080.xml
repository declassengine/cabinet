P*C.L.Board of Trade,8th June, 1925.
Reprinted from The Board of Trade Journal, dated 21st May, 1925.800(-jPROGRESS   OF   OUR   FOREIGN TRADE.POST-WAR   TRADE   ON   PRE-WAR PRICE   BASIS.For the last five years we have been in the habit of publishing each quarter the results of compilations made for the purpose of determining the variations in the I volume of our import and export trade from time to time.   With that end in view the different classes of roods imported and exported, which in the Returns issued monthly are represented at their current values, were calculated on the basis of the values of corresponcl-ing classes of goods in the year 1913.    We need not dwell here upon certain difficulties and defects in the calculation upon which comment has been made from time to time.   Taken as a whole the results reached fey Stliis process represent, for each of the periods compared, Ithe values of the goods imported and exported calculated [on a common price basis.   The changes in the totals are, jconsequently, due to changes in quantities of the goods mported or exported. In the diagram which we reproduce below the results at these calculations for each quarter since the beginning lof 1920 are shown, for certain important groups of [commodities imported and exported.   For the purposes If comparison the corresponding figures for the four jouarters of the year 1913 are also represented in the [diagram.   The classes of goods selected for representa-gion are (i)  &quot; Articles Wholly or Mainly Manufac-lured.&quot; the variations in the exports of which are repre-bented in the uppsr line of the diagram, while the excess mi imports over re-exports of the same class of goods are Represented lower down in the diagram by a full line: Jnd (ii) the  class   of   goods   described in the official let-urns as &quot; Raw Materials and Articles Mainly TJn-manufactured,&quot; the net imports (imports less re-exports) of which are shown by the broken line which mainly lies between the two lines already described.The imports of raw materials condition, to a consider -able extent, the subsequent export of manufactured goods. It will be noticed that in 1913, and again in most of the subsequent years, there is a considerable seasonal variation in this . class of imports. The minimum is reached in the second or third quarter of the year, the maximum in the last quarter, which gener-ally shows a larger import than the first quarter, either of the same or the succeeding year. In view of this seasonal swing in trade, comparisons between the course of exports of manufactures and the course of imports of raw materials are likely to be misleading unless the period of comparison extends over a year at least.The diagram which appears herewith shows both the violent falling off in the volume of exports, following the great deflation of values, that began in 1920 and reached its maximum in the second quarter of 1921, when our coal mines were at a standstill, and the subsequent recovery. This recovery, at first rapid, then proceeding irregularly at a less rapid rate, appears from the diagram to have had, since the end of 1921, a fairly steady tendency, in spite of minor variations, and the corre-spondence between the rate of growth of the manufac-tured exports and the rate of growth of the imported raw materials is perhaps not the least striking feature of the diagram.There has been added, to the three lines to which refer-ence is made in the preceding, a line at the foot of the diagram showing the variations in the volume of our exports of coal. This line shows how far below the volume of the 1913 trade the exports during 1920 stood and how the recovery after June, 1921, carried the rate of export in the earlier part of 1923 fully up to the 1913 level, from which there has been a substantial falling away.VALUES ON THE BASIS OF NJI3 PRICESQUARTERLY AGGREGATES IC;20-1025 AMD 10,13.&apos;9!3 1920 1921fS6.
