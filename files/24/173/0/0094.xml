THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. CP.  292 (25).CAB I N E TSAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. Application from the Iron and Steel Industry.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. A Joint application has been received under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure from four sections of the Iron and Steel Industry, the heavy steel trade, pig iron, wrought iron, and wire, wire netting and woven wire. The precise scope of the application is as follows:-(a) Tho Heavy Steel Trade - Steel Plates, Rails, Joists, Angles, Channels, Sectional material of all descriptions, Castings, Forgings, Wire Rods, Rounds,  Squares, Flats, Hexagons, Hoops, Hot and Cold Rolled Strip, Sheet Bars, Tinplate Bars, Ingots, Blooms, Billets, Slabs, and other Semi-finished Steel.(b) Pig Iron.(c) Wrought Iron whether in partly manufacturedrods,  sections, plates or sheets, (d) The following subsidiary industries:- MildSteel and Patent Steel Wire, covering steel wire of all carbons in any of the following forms - plain drawn, round,  oval,  square, flat and other sections in coil and cut into lengths;    bright, annealed, galvanised, coppered and tinned;    strand wire and barbed wire;    together with wire netting and woven wire.state or completed into bars, hoops, strips, wire
The applicants in respect of all these sections-v-asso--associate themselves in the submission that the British Ironand Steel Industry Is at present exposed to abnormal andunfair foreign competition arising from circumstancesentirely beyond the control of those engsged In theindustry., against which it is impossible for the Industryto compete so as to remedy the excessive unemploymentamongst those engaged in it without some action of the kindcontemplated by the Procedure for the Safeguarding ofIndustries^   They point out that whilst the difficultiesof the different sections vary In some respects, and their interests are to some extent conflicting, since the producers of some of the commodities covered by theapplication are consumers of others also covered by it,yet all desire to assist in the evolution of a general policyrelating to the Iron and Steel Industry.   They have thereforecombined the seotional applications In one general application so that the needs and difficulties of all sections of the Industry included in the applicationmay be fairly and adequately submitted.It should be stated that notice has been receivedfrom the Steel Re-rollers Association - firms buying billetsand bars largely from abroad and re.*rclling them into plates,shee-tsi etc, - of their intention to Oppose the application^2.    In accordance with the White Paper   the facts whichhave to be established prima facie to the satisfaction of theBoard of Trade before an application can be referred to aCommittee for enquiry, are as follows(1) That the Industry can reasonably be regarded as of substantial importance on account either of the volumeof employment engaged in the production to which theapplication relates or of the nature of, the goods produced.The Importance from both points of view of theindustries covered by the application does not need tc bem2*.
argued.    It is perhaps doubtful if,  judged by the volume of employment, Bome of the branches of wire production strictly comply with the condition, though probably the wire industry as a whole does bo.(2) That the competition of foreign importB in the Industry is exceptional and that by reason of such competition employment in the production of the goods in question in the United Kingdom is being or Is likely to be seriously affected. It is in connection with this condition that the present application requires careful examination.The Cabinet may recollect that I stated in the House on the 16th February last that in the ordinary course the test of exceptional or abnormal competition would be a comparison of the ratios of retained imports to home production now and before the war, but that there might be exceptional cases where the industry in question had developed to a great extent since the war, and in such cases it would be necessary to review the present imports in relation to production during the years in which the industry had attained post-war proportions (Official Report, 16th February, Col. 814).Taking the sections one by one, the position is as follows:-(a) Heavy Steel.    During the war the steel producing&quot; capacity of British works was largely increased, but the actual production of Steel Ingots and Castings in 1924 amounted tone more than 7% more than in 1915 (8,281,100 tons in 1924 as against 7,663,900 tons in 1913) and at the end of the later year steel melting plants responsible in 1920 for the production of life of the total output of the country were entirely idle.Production thiB year has been at an even lower rate.    In the period January-May it amounted to only 3^191,300 tons, as compared with 3,800,000 tons in the corresponding period of 1984; the present rate of production is then no greater than in 1913.
On the other hand, the imports of steel and manufactures of steel were 745,848 tons during the period January-May 1924, and 930,934 tons during the corresponding period of the present year: the rate of imports is nearly 25 per cent, greater than in 1913.    The general tendency is unfortunately clear, and there is undoubtedly fear that unemployment in the steel industry (which for the smelting and puddling furnaces and rolling mills and forges was 26.7^ in April 1925] will be increased in the near future.(fe) PiK Iron.    The pig iron producing capacity of the country was not greatly increased during the war.   Y/hereas, however, in 1913 the average number of furnaces in blast throughout the year was 338, the maximum number blowing at one time since the war has been 303 (in August 1920) and the number had fallen by the end of 1924 to 167, and by the end of April last to 158.    The production of pig iron last year amounted to 7,318,900 tone, 29^ less than in 1913, and only 60fo of the present effective capacity.    During the present year the output has continued to fall; in the first five months it was 2,862,100 tons,  a3 compared with 3,187,200 in the corresponding period of 1924.    On the other hand imports, which in 1913 were 216,700 tons, amounted last year to 309,200 tons, and averaged in the first five months of 1925, 28,600 tons per month.    Thus while production as compared with pre-war conditions has greatly fallen, imports have substantially increased. On the other hand the imports bear still no more than a very small proportion to home production, but though the pig iron section of the Iron and Steel Industry is not very seriously threatened at the present time it is not posaibie to treat it separately from steel.    The branches of the industry are closely inter-dependent: no country can maintain a substantial steel industry for any length of time unless It has a secure foundation of domes-tic- pig iron production - otherwise it is at the mercy of its foreign suppliers who will never allow it more than their surplus
SQ2(for the pig iron producers, throughout the- world, are also steel makers) which is never likely to be large.    For the most economic production of steel it is essential that the pig iron used should be the production of the same works.  It is true that steel makers have in recent years greatly increased the use of steel scrap in steel making but this has boon possible owing to the great supplies of war scrap, and the proportion used cannot continue for long at the high level which has recently prevailed.(c) Wrought Iron. The British output of all classes of finished Wrought Iron fell from 946,400 tons in 1915 to 443,400 tons in 1924.    Imports of Wrought Iron Bars and Rods on the other hand (other than the small quantity coming from Sweden,  which are excluded by the applicants on account of their special nature) rose from 147,787 tons in 1913 to 242,805 tons last year,  so that Whereas before the war im-ports were equal to about one-sixth of the home production of Wrought Iron they now amount to more than ono-half.(d) Wire,  Wire Netting and Woven Wire. The production of wire in this country rose from 280,900 tons in 1913 to 352,200 tons in 1924,  while the imports fell from 54,400 tons to 46,200 tons..    On the other hand,  the output capacity of the industry was greatly increased during the war and its present ca,pacity is put by the applicants at 440,000 tons. Whereas the imports in the early post-war years did not exceed some 35,000 tons a year,  they rose last year to 4-6,200 tons and in the first five months of the. present year to 25,600 tons, which is at the rate of over 60,000 tons a year. The position at the moment,  therefore,  is probably this.    Imports are above pre-war in volume but not actually above the pre-war ratio to production;    imports, however, are showing a rapid and progressive increase.
Wire netting ia a email industry, the output of whioh fell from 40,000 tons in 1913 to 30,000 tons this year, while imports have risen considerably in the last two years, though they amount to less than 6,000 tons a year.The manufacture of woven wire is another small industry, the output of which has fallen by more than 50$ since before the war.   Particulars of imports are not available but they are alleged by the applicants to be relatively substantial.(3)   The third condition to be fulfilled by the applioant industry is that the exceptional competition must be shown to arise from depreciation of currency operating so as to create.an export bounty, from subsidies, bounties, or other artificial conditions, or from inferior conditions of employment of labour.   The main countries of whose competition complaint is made are Germany, Prance and Belgium, and, apart from other considerations, the applicants indicate that wageB in the iron and steel industry in all these countries are materially below those ruling in this country.    I do not think that for the purpose of establishing a prima facie case there can be any doubt that this condition is fulfilled.(4) Under the provisions of the White Paper, the only discretionary power reserved by the Board of Trade is the right to refuse an enquiry, irrespective of other conditions obtaining in the Industry, if they are of opinion (a) that the industry is not being carried on with reasonable efficiency and economy,      or (b) that the imposition-tion of a duty would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment in another industry using goods of the kind In question in production.    These questions will, of course, be the subject of   thorough examination by the Committee if the application is referred for enquiry.    I need only
say here that as regards (a) it is not disputed hy anyone, so far as I am aware, that in the British heavy iron and steel industry generally there has during the past deoade been a very great advance in equipment and methods, and that there are now a number of works in this country whose technical efficiency is of the highest order.     As regards (b) this is of course an issue of the very greatest importance, but I think it is a matter to be thrashed out in detail and I do not think the Board of Trade should, in the exeroise of its discretion, adopt the exceptional course of refusing an enquiry of this ground, unless the Cabinet are prepared to say to the iron and steel industry that in no circumstances, whatever an enquiry might disclose or recommend, are they prepared to impose any duty on any part of its products.     I refer in a later paragraph to the pronouncements on steel made when the Coalition Government were Introducing the Safeguarding of Industries Act.     In view of these statements I think it would be impossible to refuse an enquiry, however strong the prima facie case and maintain the Safeguarding policy as we have laid it down.3.   It will have been observed that the effect of the prima facie evidence available as to the exceptional nature of the foreign competition varies in the different sections of the application.     Exceptional competition appears to me to be well established in respect of heavy steel and wrought iron;    and on the whole the latest figures seem to me to furnish a prima facie case in regard to wire.     In the case of pig-iron, however, at the one end of the scale and wire netting and woven wire at the other end, the position is rather different.Wire netting and woven wire are examples of a considerable number of manufactures in the production of whioh iron and steel in one form or another serves as material.     We have already had a separate   application in respect of wire nails and applications for other artioles may of course come in.     On merit I think a prima fade case is established in regard to wire netting and-7-
woven wire.     The two Industries are closely interlinked and may properly be  considered as different branches of the same industry.      They are members of the relational Federation of iron and Steel Manufacturers.    They have  joined in the combined application, and I think on balance that their application should be referred to the same Committee.As regards pig iron, which in one sense can be regarded as raw material of the Iron and Steel industry,  it cannot be said that the claim of exceptional foreign competition at the present time is very well established,  having regard to the small quantity of the imports even now as compared with the home production.     The position iSf this part of the industry is, however, very unsatisfactory and although the application is put forward in four sections it is deliberately made by the industry as a joint application, and, having regard to the close relation between the production of pig iron and the further processes through which the pig is put and to the use of iron and steel scrap as alternative materials in these further processes, I am of opinion that if reference is made to a Committee the industry should not be refused the opportunity of stating its case in respect of pig iron as well as in respect of the other sections of the industry.4.    In the foregoing pages I have dealt only with the statistical data of production,  imports,  exports etc.    I feel bound to add that these .do not present a complete picture of the Iron and Steel Industry.      It is common knowledge that a large number of orders have been tafcen at a loss and that the financial position of a number of firms is serious.     This cannot go on indefinitely.     And in the iron and steel trade the relation of volume of production to cost is of course enormously important.     Moreover the effect on the coal trade of reduced production of Iron and steel is obvious.
5.    It may not be out of place,  in considering generally the claim, of the Iron and Steel Industry to some safeguarding of its position when threatened by foreign competition,  to draw attention to the fact that in passing the Safeguarding of Industries Act,  the Government spokesmen laid stress on the importance of being able to safeguard the steel industry.(Intld.)    p.

Extract from Parliamentary Debates dated 9th Hay, 1921,Safeguarding of Industries. Column 1603.1 SIR A.MOND. * * * * but I defy any Government, whatever its 1&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;   1      &quot;&quot;*complexion, to stand at this box while one of our great industries was being seriously damaged by unfair competition, while works after works were being shut down and then thrown out of employment - I defy even any member of the Labour party to say that that should be allowed to continue, Neither should the British manufacturer on the British workman be compelled, in the interest of some so-called consumer, in vacuo, to see the destruction of our industries.SIR ALFRED MOND - Parliamentary Debates, May 9,  1921 (Vol.  141, Cols.  1601-2).The question is how many years they (hon. members) want to see our great steel Industry stand idle - not months, but years - how long the workers are to walk the streets while slowly, by the operation of economic laws, the exchanges begin to get right.  -----     I am speaking of the great manufacturing industries, and I have come to the conclusion that I cannot be responsible for seeing them go out of operation, seeing their skilled staffs disperse and their plant and machinery fall into disuse and disrepair.
SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES PROCEDURE BRITISH IRONAND STEEL INDUSTRY.APPLICATION TO THE BOARD OF TRADE ON BEHALF .0F THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A COMMITTEE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE WHITE PAPER  CMD.  2327,  DATED  FEBRUARY,   1925.This General Application comprises the following sections : 1. The Heavy Steel Trade.2. Pig Iron.3. Wrought Iron.4. Wire, Wire Netting and Woven Wire.If the unfair competition complained of can be effectively met it is estimated that additional permanent employment would be provided in respect of the home market alone as follows : making a total of 105,000 men. To this must be added the additional employment provided by the expenditure by these workmen of full wages instead of the present smaller figure of unemployment pay, also the additional employment resulting from the increased competitive power of the above industries in overseas markets due to the reduction in costs consequent upon the additional volume of pro-duction which it is expected would accrue as a result of the relief applied for. In addition, further employment would be provided in the Coal,&apos;Coke, Transport and many other Industries by reason of the increased demand for commodities generally.The Applicants in respect of all these Sections associate themselves in the submission that the British Iron and Steel Industry is at present exposed to abnor-mal and unfair foreign competition arising from circumstances entirely beyond the control of those engaged in the Industry against which it is impossible for theEXPLANATORY   STATEMENT.
Industry to compete so as to remedy the excessive unemployment amongst those engaged in the Industry without some action being taken as is contemplated by the procedure for the Safeguarding of Industries.The Applicants also all believe that it is in the National interest that such action should be taken.The reasons for these opinions are set out in the separate Applications drawn up by each Section.It is, however, obvious that the difficulties of the various Applicants vary in some respects and that their interests are to some extent conflicting, representing as they do both producers and consumers of some of the productions comprised in the Applications.The Applicants all share the desire to assist in the evolution of a general policy relating to the Iron and Steel Industry which will be of the greatest National benefit.They have come to the conclusion that the best course to be taken to enable Parliament to have the best possible information in developing such a policy would be to combine the sectional applications in one general application so that the general needs and difficulties of all the sections of the Industry included in the Application may be fairly and adequately submitted to the Committee appointed to deal with the Applications.With this object it has been arranged that whilst the various sections will so far as practicable act in co-operation each section will prepare its own case and supply its own witnesses to deal with its special difficulties and requirements.PEAT, MARWICK, MITCHELL &amp; CO.,Secretaries to the General Application.11, Ironmonger Lane, E.C. 2. 5th June, 1925.
APPLICATION TO THE  BOARD OF TRADE ON BEHALF OF THE HEAVY  STEEL INDUSTRY FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A COMMITTEE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF  THE WHITE PAPER  CMD.   2327,  DATED   FEBRUARY,   1925.(1)     The application is made in respect of the following Steel Products : Steel Plates, Rails, Joists, Angles, Channels, Sectional material of all descriptions, Castings, Forgings, Wire Rods, Rounds, Squares, Flats, Hexagons, Hoops, Hot and Cold Rolled Strip, Sheet Bars, Tin-plate Bars, Ingots, Blooms, Billets, Slabs, and other Semi-finished Steel.(2) The applicants are a Representative Committee appointed by the producers of the articles mentioned in paragraph (1) for the purpose of making and supporting this application.The Secretaries of this Committee are :  .Peat, Mar wick, Mitchell &amp; Co., 11, Ironmonger Lane,London, E.C. 2.The Committee are representative of all Sections of the Trade covered by this application, and definitely representative of the great majority engaged therein; although intimation of positive support has not been received from every individual manufacturer at the date of this application, no objection to the application has been received and in that sense it may be said in principle to be practically unanimous.(3) The nature of the application is for the imposition of such duty or the granting of such other relief as would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition referred to later.(4) The following information is given for the purpose of satisfying the Board of Trade of the existence of a prima facie case for enquiry and the applicants will be prepared to appear before the Committee and to produce more detailed evidence in support of the application.(5) Importance of the Industry.The Labour Gazette of April, 1925, gives the estimated number of insured workpeople engaged in iron and steel melting furnaces, rolling mills, &amp;c, as 236,500. In addition, the Heavy Steel Industry involves the employment of many thousandsSAFEGUARDING  OF  INDUSTRIES PROCEDURE HEAVYSTEEL  TRADE. &apos;
of workpeople in connection with coal, coke, iron ore, limestone and other materials used in the production of Steel, and in the transport of these materials and the finished products.. In 1913 the production of steel ingots and castings amounted to 7,663,900 tons, and reached 8,221,100 tons in 1924. During the war the steel production capacity of the works in this Country increased by 50 per cent., so that during the last year actual production was approximately 33Jrd per cent, less than the actual capacity.The exports of iron and steel in 1913 were 4,969,200 tons of a value of  55,350,700 or 10-5 per cent, of the value of the total exports of the United Kingdom; in 1924 exports of iron and steel amounted to 3,853,100 tons valued at  74,548,100 or 9-4 per cent, of the total exports. The exports of pig iron and ferro-alloys (included in the above figures) amounted in 1913 to 1,124,200 tons and in 1924 to 600,400 tons.The iron and steel industry is absolutely essential to the Country&apos;s defence as was recently demonstrated, and it is largely on the grounds of its essential character from this point of view that our European competitors justify the State encouragement and support of these industries in their respective territories. During the late war steel was required not only for shells (at one time nearly one-third of the ingot output of the Country was used for shells) but also for military railways, mechanical transport, aeroplanes, tanks, battleships, and especially after the submarine campaign merchant vessels, &amp;c, and although every effort was made by means of restricting exports and ensuring that, as far as possible, steel was not used for any but essential Avar work, the steel capacity of the Country was found to be totally inadequate for the Country&apos;s needs, and Great Britain had not only to extend her own steel works very substantially, but also to import steel from America, and even from Australia and India.(6) Present  Position  of the  Industry and  Effects  of  Exceptional Competition from Foreign Imports.(a) Production. Although the productive capacity for the making of Steel had been largely increased, production in 1924 amounted to only 7 per cent, more than in 1913. Production in 1925 has so far been at an even lower rate than in 1924, production in the first quarter of 1925 amounting only to 1,942,100 tons compared with 2,278,800 tons in the first quarter of 1924, and is still declining production in April 1925, amounting to only 597,600 tons compared with 711,500 tons in April, 1924.(6) Imports. Owing to the increased productive capacity, the full steel requirements of the Country could have been supplied by British works. The advantages enjoyed by our competitors, enumerated later, were however, such that
imports of Steel (i.e., excluding pig and wrought iron) during 1924 amounted to 1,859,600 tons compared with 1,803,600 tons in 1913, the year of previous maximum imports.The increase in imports, coupled with the decrease in exports, is such that whereas in 1913 exports exceeded imports by some 155,000 tons monthly, in the first quarter of 1925 this margin had been reduced to an average of 70,400 tons monthly, and in April, 1925, to only 24,800 tons.Looked at in another way, if the imports are exjaressed in terms of ingot tonnage, it will be found that imports in 1913 represented 27 per cent, of the ingot production of that year ; in the first quarter of 1925 they represented 32 per cent, and in April 42 per cent, of production, when production was reduced by reason of the Easter Holidays ; while expressed as a percentage of the exports, imports&apos; were 46 per cent, in 1913, 67 per cent, in the first quarter of 1925, and 84 per cent.&apos; in April.These foreign imports were for some years before the war a matter of concern to British producers, but under the general economic conditions then ruling the effects, though serious, were not so disastrous as they have been during the severe depression in trade since 1920. Unfortunately a considerable number of steel works have been obliged to close down and those works still running are running at much less than full capacity. It is certain that unless some relief is obtained some works at present operating part time will be compelled to close altogether as they cannot hold out much longer under the conditions now prevailing. The trade is not only suffering from loss of orders but also from the very low selling prices which have been driven down to an unprofitable level by the importation of cheap foreign material, produced by cheap labour having a much lower standard of living than obtains in this country, further assisted by. falling exchanges.(c) Exports. The position is aggravated by the fact that, contrary to imports which have increased, exports of steel (i.e., excluding pig iron and wrought iron) have declined and in 1924 amounted to 3,192,700 tons as compared with: 3,663,500 tons in 1913.(d) Unemployment dtie to Fweign Competition. A great proportion of the Imports during 1924 consisted of semi-finished material, viz., blooms, billets and slabs (707,800 tons), and sheet and tinplate bars (380,100) tons which are re-heated and re-rolled in the sheet and other finishing mills of this Country. The import of semi-finished material, therefore, gives employment to a certain number of work-people in the iron and steel industry, but the labour involved in connection with coal, coke, iron ore, limestone, &amp;c, and in producing the semi-finished product from these raw materials is lost to the Country, which would not be the case if the imports were replaced by British-made material and employment in the finishing-mills would not be affected thereby.
If the iron and steel imported into the United Kingdom in. 1.924 had been made in this Country itwould have given employment to approximately 100,000 men throughout the year.While according to the figures collected by the Ministry of Labour the percentage of unemployed for all insured trades in Great Britain in April, 1925, was 11 -2 percent., the percentage of unemployment in steel melting and iron puddling furnaces and iron and steel rolling mills and forges was 26-7. The manufacture of steel, however, provides not only direct employment but also employment in the blast furnaces, iron ore and coal mines and limestone quarries, in transport and in other ways.In this connection it should be stated that owing to the continued depression, in the industry many skilled men have left the country and emigrated, especially to America, and that unless this is stopped, difficulty will be experienced when a revival of trade sets in.(e) Works Idle. At the end of 1924 a considerable number of steel melting plants responsible in 1920 for the production of 1,057,000 tons of steel, or 11 per cent, of the total production of the country and employing large numbers of workpeople, were entirely idle.(/) Prices. The cost of British Steel Products to the consumer is only about 30 per cent, above 1913, as compared with approximately 63 per cent, for all commodities. It is estimated that the price of coal for Steel works is about 80 per cent, above 1913 figures.(7) Prices op Foreign Imports.The prices of Foreign Steel Products imported into the United Kingdom are substantially below British prices.The Applicants will be able to prove that the competition of foreign imports in their industry is exceptional, and that by reason of such competition, employ-ment in production of the goods in question in the United Kingdom is being seriously affected.(8) Factors assisting Foreign Competitors.The following sections deal with factors assisting Continental competitors, many of which it is submitted may be regarded as unfair.(a) Depreciating Exchanges. The effect of depreciating exchanges in stimu-lating export trade is well known. When a country&apos;s exchange falls, and the currency loses external purchasing power more rapidly than internal purchasing power, all its exporting industries receive what amounts to a subsidy, and its exports are violently stimulated. Thus, when the French and Belgian exchanges dropped early in 1924 their exports of iron and steel suddenly increased.   For instance, in
January the French franc fell from 87-80 to 94-35, and exports of iron and steel increased from 215,000 tons in January to 274,000 tons in February. In February the exchange fell from 9L92 to 103-20, and in March exports rose to 309,000 tons. When the exchange rose again the process was reversed and exports declined. The fact that the increase took place a month or six weeks after the fall of the exchange is caused by the lag which occurs between the placing of orders due to the stimulus of the falling exchange, and the shipment in fulfilment of them.Similar considerations accentuated Belgian competition. Since the stabilisation-tion of the German currency, however, competition from Germany has been influenced by periods of credit stringency during which it was cheaper to sell the products of the industry below costs of production than pay the very high rates demanded for financial accommodation.(b) Lower Taxation and Bating. Taxation in Great Britain is much higher than in other countries. Local taxation also bears heavily on the industry, and the cost of local taxation and social services (Workmen&apos;s Compensation and National Insurance) is now from two to three times as high as in 1913.A few firms investigated this question and came to the conclusion that the cost of local taxation and social services per ton of steel from the coal and ore to the finished product varied from 8s. 6d. to 11s. 8d. per ton, whereas in 1913 they varied from 2s. lOd. to 4s. 4d. per ton. In addition to the fact that Imperial and local taxation is much higher in the United Kingdom than in any other country, the method of assessment operated more favourably in other countries. Whereas British industry pays taxes on all profits, whether distributed or not, Continental countries tax only moneys actually distributed as dividends ; in consequence, every encouragement is given to development, and many works are expanded out of profits without the necessity of raising additional capital. Attention has been drawn to cases where extensions of plant and equipment have been financed out of untaxed profits without thereby increasing the book capital of the Company.(c) Lower Capital Charges. The great expansion and improvement in British steel works to meet war requirements have been achieved at a very high capital cost even after allowing for the writings off which were permitted, whereas the expansions and improvements which have been effected in France, Germany and Belgium have been accomplished with comparatively little addition to capital charges. The French industry obtained the magnificently equipped Lorraine works from the Government at an exceedingly low figure. The Germans extended and improved the works in the Ruhr with the moneys obtained from their Government as compensation for the loss of the Lorraine works, while the result of the period of inflation has been to eliminate largely at least for the time being, the debenture charges on the German iron and steel industry. The Belgian works were rebuilt very largely from moneys obtained from the Belgian Government. The difference in the method of taxation referred to in the preceding paragraph also tends to over capital charges. It is obvious that although interest on capital does not enter into prime cost it must be taken into consideration in fixing the selling price.
(d) Lower Wages and Longer Hours.-Wh.ile the earnings of workers in the iron and steel trade in Great Britain are admittedly lower than those in many &quot; sheltered &quot; trades, they are much higher than obtain for similar workers on the Continent. It was ascertained in November last that in Belgium, for instance the average wage of the skilled worker was Belgian francs (9*ld.) an hour, or  1 16s. 6d. per week (at the rate of exchange of 92 Belgian francs to the  ); in Prance the skilled worker received 24 francs (5s. 8d.) for an 8-hour shift, or (at French francs 85 to the  )  1 13s. lid. per week; and the German skilled worker received at most 0&quot;69 marks (8&quot;28d.) an hour, or  2 Is. 5d. for a 60 hour week (converting at 20 marks to the  ). The average weekly earnings of all British iron and steel workers in November 1924 amounted to  3 3s. 7d.While the eight hour day is nominally in force in France, Belgium and Luxemburg, more latitude is allowed than in this country. Thus, in France, it is possible for the metallurgical industry in certain cases to extend its working hours so long as the maximum amount of overtime worked does not exceed 200 hours during the year. In Germany the iron and steel industry openly reverted to the two-shift system, which involved an effective ten-hour day during 1924, but as from April, 1925, the German Cabinet has ordered a reductioni ofi hours to 8 per day in the case of blast furnace and coke oven workers. In addition there is a large body of imported foreign labour in France and Belgium of all races, amounting to 10 per cent, of the total employed in iron and steel works.(e) Lower Transport Charges. Belgium, France and Germany are called upon to pay very much lower railway rates per ton per mile for the transport of material than manufacturers in the United Kingdom, and special tariff rates for metallurgical products destined for foreign export are granted to Continental manufacturers.(/) A Protected Home Market. All other iron and steel producing countries enjoy a protected home market, even Belgium, which before the war was very largely a free trade country finds it necessary to protect her own iron and steel industry by means of a tariff.(g) Subsidies on Coke and on Exports of Iron and Steel. It is obviously difficult to prove that Foreign Governments are encouraging their industrialists by means of direct bounties, but it has been constantly asserted that both France and Belgium have been supplying reparations coke to iron and steel works at a lower price than it is being credited to the reparations account. The most recent state-ment to this effect was contained in a [recent number of Koelnische Zeitung. where the Berlin correspondent writes as follows : &quot; At present the price of coke in France is 144 paper francs a ton. The French Government, however, sells the coke which it gets from
oth June, 1925.Germany on reparations account at 119 paper francs a ton. In January, 1925 the French metallurgical industry secured from the Government 325,000 tons at this price. That amounts to an average subvention of their iron industry of 325,000 times 25 paper francs. In addition the French Government subsidises the export of iron and steel to the extent of 20 paper francs a ton, so that the French iron and steel export is able to calculate on a total subvention of 45 paper francs a ton. This export premium burdens the French taxpayer, and is achieved at the cost of German industry. The latter must not only deliver cheap coke, but is also forced into a position in which it is unable to compete in its own home market. The German iron and steel duties lie at present between 6 and 9 marks a ton, that is between 30 and 45 paper francs. Hence a number of iron and steel products secure a French export subsidy of 15 francs in excess of the German duties. The export subsidy is so considerable that even the higher freight charges are outweighed.&quot;
c nSAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES PROCEDURE  PIG IRONINDUSTRY.APPLICATION  TO   THE   BOARD   OF   TRADE   ON   BEHALF   OF   THE   PIG   IRON INDUSTRY FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A COMMITTEE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE WHITE PAPER CMD. 2327, DATED FEBRUARY 3kd, 192.5.1.       The application is made in respect of Pig Iron.2. The Applicants are a representative Committee appointed by producers of Pig Iron in the United Kingdom for the purpose of making and supporting this application.   The name and address of the Secretary of the Committee is: J. T. Atkinson,Cleveland Buildings,Middlesbrough.The Committee are representative of all Sections of the Trade covered by this application, and definitely representative of the great majority engaged therein; although intimation of positive support has not been received from every individual manufacturer at the date of this application, no objection to the&quot; application has been received and in that sense it may be said in principle to be practically unanimous.3. The nature of the Application is for the imposition of such duty or the granting of such other relief as would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition referred to later.4. The following information is given for the purpose of satisfying the Board of Trade of the existence of a prima facie case for enquiry and the applicants will be prepared to appear before the Committee and to produce additional and more detailed evidence in support of the application.5.   Importance oe the Industry.The importance of the Industry is evident from the fact that in 1913 the production of Pig Iron amounted to 10,260,000 tons or 13&quot;2 per cent, of the total world production of Pig Iron ; in that year Great Britain occupied the third place as a Pig Iron producer, the first and second places being occupied by the United States and Germany respectively.The exports of Pig Iron in 1913 amounted to 1,124,181 tons, of a value of  4,824,393. Pig Iron is the raw material for wrought iron and for steel making, which in turn form the principal raw material for the shipbuilding, engineering,
structural and other industries. Pig Iron is also the raw material from which plain castings, including pipes, are made in iron foundries for general purposes and also for machined castings in engineering works.The number of insured workpeople engaged in Pig Iron manufacture, according to the Labour Gazette for February, was 30,190. The coal equivalent of the fuel used in the industry in 1913 amounted to 21,223,600 tons and in 1923 to 15,227,400 tons.The production of Pig Iron also causes a large volume of employment in iron ore and coal mines, coke ovens, limestone quarries, and on railways, not only in the conveyance of the finished Pig Iron, but in the conveyance of the materials necessary for its production.The volume of bye-products obtained from the carbonisation of coal in coke ovens, or from the blast furnaces themselves, where coal is used, is important in direct value, and also in relation to the economic operations of steel works, electric generating stations, town lighting, motor transport, &amp;c, as well as to the yield of agricultural products, all of which advantages are lost on iron that is imported into this country. The bye-products of coke ovens and blast furnaces consist of sulphate of ammonia fertilisers, tar (now so much used for combining with slag for making tar macadam the principal road-making material), spare * gases for internal combustion engines in iron, steel and electricity works, fuel for steam boilers in place of coal, and for supplying light and power to town authorities ; benzol, naphtha and other chemical products ; slag building and paving bricks, concrete, &amp;c., for road making, cement and other useful goods.During the war the Government was deeply impressed with the fact that the Pig Iron industry was the key to the safety of the country, and urged upon manufacturers the extension and economic development of their plants, to meet immediate needs, and the expected increased demand on the return to peace conditions, as well as to balance the producing capacity of the steel works ; and as a consequence much capital was expended on such developments, and is now idle or unremunerative. Without blast furnace plants and coke ovens in operation, and the use of the power which they supply, many steel works must close down, even if competition is normal.6.   Present Position oe the Industry.(a) Furnaces in blast. The blast furnaces of the country number 482, of which, having regard to their equipment, 366 can be blowing at one time. In 1913 the average number in blast throughout the year was 338. Since the war the maximum number blowing at one time has been 303 in August, 1920. At the beginning of 1924 there were 204 furnaces in blast. These had fallen by the end of the year to 167 and by the end of April, 1925, had still further fallen to 158. On the other hand the numbers in operation on the Continent have steadily risen;
	1924.	1925.	Tons.	Tons.January         ..	636,600	574,500February	612,700	541,900March......	668,600	607,900April    ..       . .	618,400	569,800	2,536,300	2,294,100It will be seen that in the first four months of this year production has been 242,200 tons less than in the corresponding period of last year, or at a rate of over 700,000 tons per annum less, i.e., if the current rate continues production in 1925 will be about 10 per cent, less than in 1924. Whereas 1913 production represented 13*2 per cent, of the world production of Pig Iron, Great Britain was responsible in 1924 for only 11*8 per cent, of the world production, and this proportion is falling, as the proportion of Great Britain&apos;s output of the total world production in the first quarter of 1925 has been only 9*3 per cent. If the United States is excluded and Great Britain&apos;s production compared with that of the other European producing countries, it will be found that Great Britain contributed 27*8 per cent, of the output in 1913 and 26*5 per cent, of the output in 1924, while in the first quarter of 1925 this proportion had still further fallen to 24*4 per cent.(c) Imports. Imports of Pig Iron in 1913 amounted to 216,700 tons, of which 107,500 tons were Hematite, there being a shortage of that quality in that year, and 77,300 tons basic foundry and forge iron. In 1924, they amounted to 309,200 tons, of which 285,800 tons were basic, foundry and forge qualities, being an increase of 43 per cent, on the total volume, or an increase of 270 per cent, on basic, foundry and forge iron qualities which are made chiefly from home ores. Imports in the first quarter of 1924 averaged 23,500 tons per month and in the first quarter of 1925, 29,600 tons per month. Whereas imports in 1913 amounted to 19 per cent, of the exports, in the first quarter of 1925 they amounted to 55 per cent, of the tonnage exported.in the case of France the number of furnaces blowing, which stood at 125 at the beginning of January, 1924, rose to 133 by the end of the year, and to 136 by the end of March, 1925. In the case of Belgium 41 were in blast at the beginning of 1924, 49 by the end of the year, and 51 at the end of April, 1925.(6) Production. The production of Pig Iron in 1924 amounted to 7,318,900 tons, or 29 per cent, less than in 1913. - This represents only 60 per cent, of the present effective capacity and is less even than was obtained in 1880, when production amounted to 7,749,200 tons. Throughout 1924 the production of Pig Iron was generally falling ; it amounted to 668,600 tons in March and only 580,300 tons in December. Production in the first four months of 1925, compared with the corresponding months of 1924, has been as follows : 
The imports are chiefly from Belgium, France, Luxemburg and Germany.(d) Exports. Exports on the other hand have declined from 1,124,200 tons in 1913 to 600,300 tons in 1924, a decrease of 47 per cent. If Ferro-alloys which are a speciality of Great Britain be excluded, imports increased between 1913 and 1924 by 56*0 per cent., and exports declined by 51*3 per cent.(e) Prices. The average ascertained price realised in Great Britain of No. 3 Cleveland Pig Iron, which may be taken as fairly illustrative of the industry in 1913, was 60s. per ton. The ascertained price in the quarter ending March 31st, 1925, was 78s. 6*87d., or an increase of only 31-3 per cent. ; and the prices are still falling. The Board of Trade Index Number for all commodities in April was 62*6 per cent, above pre-war.(/) Efficiency. The comparison of the Board of Trade Index Number and that of Pig Iron prices may be cited as a measure of the efficiency and economy obtaining in the industry, which alone has enabled it to exist up to the present in spite of adverse circumstances.(g) Unemployment. While, according to the figures collected by the Ministry of Labour, the percentage unemployed for all insured trades in Great Britain in April, 1925, was 11*2 per cent., the percentage of unemployment in Pig Iron manu-facture was 20*4 per cent. The manufacture of Pig Iron, however, provides not only direct employment as before stated, but also employment in the iron ore and coal mines and limestone quarries, in transport and in other ways, and it is estimated that to produce 1,000 tons of Pig Iron per annum requires the services of 20 men from the raising of the raw material to delivering the finished Pig Iron. Had the 300,000 tons which were imported in 1924 been made in this country, therefore, employment would have been found for 6,000 additional men. Assuming these men received  60 per annum in unemployment pay, a total of  360,000 was thus expended, equal to 24s. per ton of Pig Iron imported. In addition to the amount of unemployment pay there would have been heavy supplementary allowances in the form of Poor Law Relief out of local rates, thus increasing the bivrdens upon industry.(h) Works Idle. It has been stated above that of 482 furnaces, only 158 are now in blast. It may be added that 31 complete plants for the manufacture of Pig Iron were entirely idle at 31st December, 1924, and the men at several works are now under notice to terminate their engagement preparatory to closing down the plants.The Applicants will be able to prove that the competition of foreign imports in their industry is exceptional and that by reason of such competition employment in the production of the goods in question in the United Kingdom is being and is likely to be seriously affected.(7) Factors assisting Foreign Competition.The following sections deal with factors assisting foreign competitors, many of which, it is submitted, may be regarded as unfair.
r H r(a) Depreciating Exchanges. The effect of depreciating exchanges in stimu-lating export trade is well known. When a country&apos;s exchange falls, and the currency loses external purchasing power more rapidly than internal purchasing power, all its exporting industries receive what amounts to a subsidy, and its exports are violently stimulated. Thus, when French and Belgian exchanges dropped early in 1924 their exports of iron and steel suddenly increased. For instance, in January the French franc fell from 87*80 to 94&quot;35, and exports of iron and steel increased from 215,000 tons in January to 274,000 tons in feburary. In February the exchange fell from 91*92 to 103*20 and March exports rose to 309,000 tons. When the exchange rose again the process was reversed and exports declined. The fact that the increase took place a month or six weeks after the fall of the exchange is caused by the lag which occurs between the placing of orders due to the stimulus of the falling exchange and the shipment in fulfilment of them.Similar considerations accentuated Belgian competition. Since the stabilisation-tion of the German currency, however, competition from Germany has been influenced by periods of credit stringency during which it was cheaper to sell the products of the industry below costs of production than pay the very high rates demanded for. financial accommodation.(b) Lower Taxation and Rating. -Taxation in Great Britain is much higher than in other countries. Local taxation also bears heavily on the industry, and the cost of local taxation and social services (Workmen&apos;s Compensation and National Insurance) is now from two to three times as high as in 1913.In addition to the fact that Imperial and Local taxation is much higher in the United Kingdom than in any other country, the method of assessment operates more favourably in other countries. Whereas British industry pays taxes on all profits, whether distributed or not, Continental countries tax only moneys actually distributed as dividends ; in consequence every encouragement is given to develop-ment, and many works are expanded out of profits without the necessity of raising additional capital. Attention has been drawn to cases where extensions of plant and equipment have been financed out of untaxed profits without thereby increasing the book capital of the company.(c) Lower Capital Charges. The great expansion and improvement in British iron and steel works to meet war requirements have been achieved, at a very high capital cost, even after allowing for the writings off which were permitted, whereas the expansions and improvements which have been effected in France, Germany and Belgium have been accomplished with comparatively little addition to capital charges.The French industry obtained the magnificently equipped Lorraine works from the Government at an exceedingly low figure. The Germans extended and improved the works in the Ruhr with the moneys obtained from their Government as compensation for the loss of the Lorraine works, while the result of the period
of inflation has been to eliminate largely, at least for the time being, the debenture charges on the German, iron and steel industry. The Belgian works were rebuilt very largely from moneys obtained from the Belgian Government. The difference in the method of taxation referred to in the preceding paragraph also tends to lower capital charges. It is obvious that although interest on capital does not enter into the prime cost it must be taken into consideration in fixing selling prices.(d) Lower Wages and Longer Hours. While the earnings of workers in the iron and steel trade in Great Britain are admittedly lower than those in many &quot; sheltered &quot; trades, they are much higher than obtain for similar workers on the Continent. It was ascertained in November last that in Belgium, for instance, the average wage of the skilled worker was 3  Belgian francs (9&apos;13d.) an hour, or  1 16s. 6d. per week (at the rate of exchange of 92 Belgian francs to the  1) ; in France the skilled worker received 24 francs (5s. 8d.) for an 8-hour shift, or (at French francs 85 to the  )  1 13s. lid. per week; and the German skilled worker received at most 0-69 marks (8-28cl.) an hour, or  2 Is. 5d. for a 60 hour week (converting at 20 marks to the  ). The average weekly earnings of all British iron and steel workers in November, 1924, amounted to  3 3s. 7d.While the eight hour day is nominally in force in France, Belgium and Luxemburg, more latitude is allowed than in this country. Thus, in France, it is possible for the metallurgical industry in certain cases to extend its working hours so long as the maximum amount of overtime worked does not exceed 200 hours during the year. In Germany the iron and steel industry openty reverted to the two-shift system, which involved an effective ten-hour day during 1924, but as from April, 1925, the German Cabinet has ordered a reduction of hours to eight per day in the case of blast furnace and coke oven workers. In addition there is a large body of imported foreign labour in France and Belgium of all races, amounting to 10 per cent, of the total employed in iron and steel works.(e) Lower Transport Charges. Belgium, France and Germany are called upon to pay very much lower railway rates per ton per mile (amounting to from 50 per cent, to 66 per cent, less) for the transport of material than manufacturers in the United Kingdom, arid special tariff rates for metallurgical products destined for foreign export are granted to Continental manufacturers.(/) A Protected Home Market. All other iron and steel producing countries enjoy a protected home market, even Belgium, which before the war was very largely a free trade country, finds it necessary to protect her own iron and steel industry by means of a tariff.(g) Subsidies on Coke and on Exports of Iron and Steel. It is obviously difficult to prove that foreign Governments are encouraging their industrialists by means of direct bounties, but it has been constantly asserted that both France
5th June, 1925.and Belgium have been supplying reparations coke to iron and steel works at a lower price than it is being credited to the reparations account. The most recent statement to this effect was contained in a recent number of the Koelnische Zeitung, where the Berlin correspondent writes as follows : &quot; At present the price of coke in France is 144 paper francs a ton. The French Government, however, sells the coke which it gets from Germany on reparations account for 119 paper francs a ton. In January, 1925, the French metallurgical industry secured from the Government 325,000 tons at this price. That amounts to an average subvention of their iron industry of 325,000 times 25 paper francs. In addition the French Government subsidises the export of iron and steel to the extent of 20 paper francs a ton, so that the French iron and steel exporter is able to calculate on a total subvention of 45 paper francs a ton. This export premium burdens the French taxpayer, and is achieved at the cost of German industry. The latter must not only deliver cheap coke, but is also forced into a position in which it is unable to compete in its own home market. The German iron and steel duties lie at present between 6 and 9 marks a ton, that is between 30 and 45 paper francs. Hence a number of iron and steel products secure a French export subsidy of 15 francs in excess of the German duties. The export subsidy is so considerable that even the higher freight charges are outweighed.&quot;
SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES PROCEDURE WROUGHT IRON.APPLICATION TO THE BOARD OF TRADE ON BEHALF OF THE WROUGHT IRON INDUSTRY FOR THE APPOINTMENT OE A COMMITTEE UNDER  THE PROVISIONS OF THE WHITE PAPER CMD. 2327, DATED FEBRUARY,  1925.(1)     The Application is made in respect of the following productions : Wrought Iron, whether in a partly-manufactured state or converted into bars, hoops, strips, wire-rods, sections, plates or sheets.(2) Name and Qualification of Applicant.The Application is made by the Council of British Wrought Iron Associations, which comprises practically the whole of the manufacturers in the United Kingdom of the goods referred to in the foregoing description. The name and address of the Secretary is : Henry Smith Knowles,Atlantic Chambers,Brazennose Street,Manchester.The Application has the unqualified support of nearly 90 per cent, of the trade calculated on the basis of production ; and there is reason to believe that some of the remaining firms would have concurred in the Application had their office arrangements not been dislocated through the temporary closing of their works. As, however, after due notice, no single Wrought Iron manufacturer has given any indication of being opposed to the Application, the Council feels justified in claiming that it has the unanimous support of the trade.(3) The nature of the Application is for the imposition of such duty or the granting of such other relief as would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition referred to later.(4) The following information is given for the purpose of satisfying the Board of Trade of the existence of a prima facie case for enquiry and the Applicants will be prepared to appear before the Committee and to produce more detailed evidence in support of the Application.
(5) Importance of the Industry.(a) Production, Selling Value, Employment. The figures given in Table I are based on information furnished by firms representing nearly 90 per cent, of the total production of the trade. In a few cases, representing less than 1 per cent., the returns of tonnage and value were not completed for the entire period covered, and the missing figures have been filled in by comparison with similar works in the same district. The numbers given in Section (6) relate to the workpeople employed directly in the production of the tonnages shown in (a).TABLE I.

Table II shows, for the purpose of comparison, the total production of the same classes of goods in the United Kingdom. The 1913 tonnage is based on figures collected by the now-dissolved British Iron Trade Association ; and the tonnages for 1920 and onwards are as compiled by the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers. The selling-values and persons employed (all regarded as males) are calculated on the tonnage for each year in the same ratio as in Table I.It should be noted that in the boom year of 1920 the demand for finished iron was greater than the supply, and the trade could have produced more if the output had not been affected by the transition to the 8-hour shift in the works.The disparity between the production tonnages in Tables I and II is largely due to the fact that many firms have gone out of the trade, and it has therefore not been possible to obtain returns from them.

Genuine Wrought Iron, such as is manufactured by the British Works on whose behalf this application is made, holds an important place in the national economy. It is the premier material for welding and, owing to its ability to resist all forms of corrosion, resulting from atmospheric, damp, and alternate wet and dry conditions, it possesses exceptionally high lasting properties. These characteristics, combined with its great resisting power against sudden shocks, render it particularly suitable for a wide variety of purposes, such as ship-chains and cables, &amp;c, for which no satisfactory substitute has been found.The importance of the productions of the Applicants from the National point of view is proved by the demands made upon the British producers during the recent war.6.   Imports.The competition of foreign imports is most keenly felt in Wrought Iron Bars and Rods ; and as will be seen by the subjoined Tables (III and IV), the tonnage of these goods imported into this Country in 1924 was considerably greater than in 1913, when the highest pre-war figure was reached. This foreign competition was, for many years before the war, a matter of great concern to British producers ; but under the general economic conditions then ruling, the effects, although serious, were not so disastrous as they have been during the severe depression in trade since the boom of 1920. In evidence of this, it is a regrettable fact that, within the last few years, no less than 41 Ironworks capable of employing, under normal conditions, nearly 9,500 workpeople, have either permanently or temporarily closed, and the remaining works are only able to secure sufficient orders to keep them running for about 65 per cent, of capacity. ;.;
The position has become so grave that the Wrought Iron trade of this country is seriously threatened with extinction. It is certain that, unless some relief is obtained, other works at present operating part time, will be compelled to close altogether, as they cannot hold out much longer under the conditions now prevailing. The trade is not only suffering from the loss of orders, but also from the very low selling-prices, which have been driven down to an unprofitable level by the importation of cheap foreign material.The cause of this deplorable state of affairs will perhaps be better realised when it is remembered that whereas in 1913, against the aggregate home production of 946,400 tons of finished Wrought Iron, there was an importation of 157,787 tons or 16*67 per cent. ; in 1924, when there was already widespread unemployment owing to the depressed state of trade, it had risen to the disquieting percentage of 57-02, the home production being 443,400 tons against an importation of 252,805 tons.TABLE III.IMPORTS OF FINISHED WROUGHT IRON INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM.(Imports of Bars and Rods from Sweden excluded on account of their special nature.

The continued depreciation of the currency in the principal Continental competing countries has operated as an export bounty, and in the Wrought Iron Trade this is particularly so in the case of Belgian com-competing products. The effect of this is demonstrated by the following table (V.) connecting the imports of Wrought Iron materials into Britain in relation to the position of the exchange between the two countries ; and in considering this table time must be allowed to lapse between the placing of the order and the delivery of the goods, and the lag of two months must therefore, be allowed. It will be found that during the two months when the exchange has fallen, the imports from Belgium have materially increased.Principal Countries of Consignment of Imports into the United Kingdom of WROUGHT IRON BARS AND RODS

It is also constantly asserted that both France and Belgium have been supplying reparations fuel to their Iron and Steel works at an artificially low price, and, further, that in the case of France, the Government subsidises the exports of Iron and Steel.In addition, taxation on the Continent is admittedly much lower per capita than in this country : Local rates and social services in Britain have increased considerably more than three-fold per ton of output.(c) Labour Conditions. It has not proved possible to obtain a direct com-parison of the constituent elements of production-costs with the Continent, for lack of information of detail of Continental wages and working conditions ; but, generally, it is possible to offer some explanation of the wide discrepancy in price that obtains between British costs and Continental selling-prices. The difference in the wages of labour of the class affected in this trade is approximately 40 per cent, in favour of the Continent, i.e., the Continental metal workers receive about 60 per cent, of the wages for a longer week than the British workers.On the subject of hours while an 8-hour day is nominally worked in Britain, actually the working time, owing to the operation of the three-shift system is less than 48 hours per week, whereas on the Continent, even in France and Belgium where the 8-hour day is nominally adopted, there is substantial latitude in regard to overtime, extending in France in some cases to 200 hours per annum.
The chief opposing factors against which British works are struggling and which cause the unfair competition alleged are, therefore, claimed to be : Depreciation of Currency ;Lower Continental Transport Costs ;Lower Continental Taxation ;Lower Continental Wages and Labour Conditions.These are accentuated by the handicap arising from the mis-cellaneous and retail character of the orders available, due to British consumers placing their bulk orders with the Continent; andThe short-time working forced on British Works owing to the large importation of Continental material.These are all factors with far-reaching effects, and when taken together, there can be little cause for surprise at the wide disparity between British and Continental selling-prices.(9) The Applicants will be prepared to prove that the competition of Foreign Imports in their Industry is exceptional, and that by reason of such competition employment in production of the goods in question in the United Kingdom is being seriously affected. They desire to emphasize the fact that such abnormal competition is aided by circumstances which cause the competition to be unfair and that these circumstances are entirely beyond the control of those responsible for the conduct of the Wrought Iron industry in this Country.5th June, 1925.
a Q ISAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES PROCEDURE THE WIRE TRADE.APPLICATIONS   TO   THE   BOARD   OF   TRADE   ON   BEHALF   OF   THE   WIRE INDUSTRY FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A COMMITTEE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE WHITE  PAPER CMD. 2,327, DATED FEBRUARY, 1925.The following subsidiary Industries associate themselves with the Applica-tion made by the Steel Manufacturers representing the Heavy Steel Industry under the provisions of the Safeguarding of Industries Procedure, and hereby make formal application in respect of the Subsidiary Industries which they represent, and hereinafter called the &quot; Subsidiary Industries.&quot;The Subsidiary Trades concerned comprise Mild Steel Wire Manufacturers. Patent Steel Wire Manufacturers. Wire Netting Manufacturers. Woven Wire Manufacturers.The application is made in respect of steel wire of all carbons in any of the following forms : Plain drawn, round, oval, square, flat and other sections, in coiland cut into lengths. Bright, annealed, coppered and tinned. Strand wire and barb wire.The application in respect of these Subsidiary Industries is made by a representative Committee appointed by the Manufacturers in such Industries, to Avhom the Secretaries are Messrs. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; company^, 11, Ironmonger Lane, London, E.C. 2.The Committee are representative of all Sections of the Trade covered by this application, and definitely representative of the great majority engaged therein; although intimation of positive support has not been received from every individual manufacturer at the date of this application, no objection to the application has been received, and in that sense it may be said in principle to be practically unanimous.The nature of the application is for the imposition of such Duty, or the granting of such other relief as would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition referred to later.Since the Heavy Steel and Subsidiary Industries are by their nature inter-dependent, it Avould appear desirable that the two cases shordd be taken together and consideration be given to a National policy in regard to the Steel Trade as a AAdiole.
IMPORTANCE OE THE SUBSIDIARY INDUSTRIES. Total Production of Wire.1913    .........   280,941 tons1923        ..       ..       ..       ..   345,544    ,,1924        ........   352,243    ,,Capacity of output, 1925,        ..   439,934 tons.The increase in the capacity of output in 1925 over the year 1913 is largely due to the erection of Factories and Plant at the instance of the Ministry of Muni-tions, for the purpose of increasing the British production in time of War, in view of the previous dependence of the Country upon imported Wire. Much of this plant is now standing idle instead of being employed in the production of wire, which is at present being imported into this country.The Wire Manufacturers claim that the methods of manufacture in the country are in every way efficient, and capable of rapid expansion to satisfy the full demand of the Home Markets.Total Production of Wire Netting.In 1924 the production of Wire Netting was approximately 30,000 tons, as compared with approximately 40,000 tons in 1913, and the average number of men employed in the Industry in 1924 was approximately 1,000.Woven Wire.The Woven Wire Manufacturers have some difficulty in furnishing detailed statistical information with regard to the Industry, as no records exist of pre-War production, and Woven Wire is not separately classified in the Board of Trade Returns of Imports and Exports. This branch of foreign trade is grouped with Netting under &quot; Wire Manufactures Other Sorts.&quot;The total British production for the past year was 1,384 tons, and super-ficially 3,999,172 square feet.656 Employees are engaged in their Factories, the production per employee being approximately two tons per annum, or 1J cwts. per week.The Woven Wire Manufacturers&apos; Association will make every endeavour to get the most accurate information upon the subject possible for presentation to the Committee of Enquiry, but from their practical experience they are satisfied that there are relatively substantial importations of Woven Wire, and particularly in the finer meshes and gauges.This is to be expected, as with their low- labour costs the advantage the Con-continental manufacturers would enjoy in connection with fine meshes and gauges would manifestly be proportionately greater. Much of this fine mesh is made from Wire of 40 gauge and finer, the production of which is very slow^, and the rate per week per operative would fall substantially below the above-mentioned existing average of 1-J- cwts. per week per operative.
As an illustration, an important Woven Wire commodity is 100 meshes to the inch, woven from 40 gauge wire, the price of which is as much as  2,016 per ton, and the cost of which is almost wholly labour.It will be appreciated, therefore, that the importation of a comparatively small tonnage of a fine product of this kind would represent a relatively substantial amount of employment.The following statistics of output have now been specially assembled by the Members of the Association : 12 months ending 30th September, 1914 9,347,494 square feet.12 months ending 30th September, 1918 9,962,817 square feet.12 months ending 30th September,  1922 3,488,015 square feet.12 months ending 30th September, 1923 3,954,241 square feet.12 months ending 3\st March, 1925 3,999,172 square feet.The following are particulars of Foreign Trade in Wire and Wire Manufactures, the latter including Netting and Woven Wire : EXPORTS FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM.Wire. Wire Manufactures.1913 ...... 60,532 tons . . . . 55,739 tons1923 ...... 78,596   ,, .. . . 52,5721924 . .       . .       .. 77,922   ,, . . .. 50,2351925 (4 months)    . . 28,291   ,, . . . . 16,630   ,,IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM.Other Sorts (not Wire. Wire Nails. separately recorded).1913 ...... 54,391 tons         50,248 tons         -   tons1923 ...... 35,993                50,635 6,7591924 ...... 46,214   ,,            53,347   ,, 5,6781925 (4 months)    . . 20,766                 21,861 2,689   ,,.  The imports come chiefly from Belgium, Germany and the U.S.A.The relatively small importation of wire in 1923 is to be attributed to the interference with Continental competition by the occupation of the Ruhr. In addition the recovery of Continental manufacturers in the finished products was undoubtedly slower that in the heavy branches of the steel trade.There is a clear and evident tendency for Continental competition in the finished product to increase as is indicated by the volume of import of wire which grew to 46,214 tons in 1924 and to 62,000 tons calculated on the basis of the tonnage imported in the first four months of the present 3*-ear.Continental wages and labour conditions referred to in the application presented on behalf of the Heavy Steel Industries press with equal severity upon those engaged in the Subsidiary Industries, the cost of conversion from Steel into finished products on the Continent being correspondingly lower than the cost of conversion in this country.
Those engaged in the Subsidiary Industries, have, however, received assis-tance from the very low prices at which they have been able to buy Wire Rods and Netting Wire from the Continent, prices which are frequently  3 per ton or more lower than the corresponding British cost of manufacture.While this advantage has saved the Subsidiary Industries from disaster, their difficulties have been none the less great, and a large volume of Home Trade has been lost to Continental Manufacturers, and those engaged in the Subsidiary Industries view with great concern a gradually increasing dependence upon foreign sources of supply of their raw material. They, therefore, in their own interest not less than in the National interest, cordially associate themselves with the Heavy Steel Industry in their present application in the hope that a National Policy may be devised to enable the British Steel Industry to tide over the present position of difficulty.The representatives of the Subsidiary Industries would not be prepared to commit themselves to an expression of opinion as to the wisdom of any measure of assistance for the Heavy Steel Industry Were the wage and other conditions on the Continent and in this country the same, but they are convinced that it is not in the National interest that any branch of the Steel Trade should be exposed to competition from Steel and Steel manufactures produced on the Continent at wages substantially lower than those paid in this country.It is estimated that if the Wire at the present time imported into this country were manufactured in Great Britain increased employment would immediately be given to approximately 3,000 additional men in the Wire Drawing Mills alone, exclusive of the labour incidental to the production of the Steel.It is true that the amount of additional employment which would be afforded were the whole of the Wire Netting and Woven Wire at the present time imported into this country made in Great Britain would only amount to about 200 men in the Netting and Weaving Factories. Those engaged in these branches of industry would, however, urge that if the Wire were purchased in this country and made from British steel, further employment would be given for approximately 1,000 men.They further urge that seeing that the raw material of their industries is Wire which they desire to purchase as cheaply as possible, the Steel Industries should be reviewed as a whole.In conclusion the representatives of the Subsidiary Industries invoke in support of their Application all the information submitted by the Heavy Steel Industry in their Application, particularly the factors assisting foreign competitors set out in Section 8 sub-sections A, B, C, D, E, F and G thereof.5th June, 1925.
