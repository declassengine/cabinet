9 it 1 &amp; 0 iThe Remedy for Unemployment.GET THE WORKERS BACK TO WORK !I make no apology for putting forward the following proposals for alleviating the unemployment situation. I first outlined these proposals when I was Minister of Health. I submitted the scheme to my colleagues in 1922, and it was still under consideration when the Government went out of office. I have referred to the scheme several times both in articles and speeches since, and now at the request of many people who desire to see i a fuller exposition of the scheme, I propose setting forward the proposals in detail.THE PRESENT UNEMPLOYMENT POSITION,In view of the present unemployment position all thinking people are agreed that every possible avenue of amelioration must be explored, and that any scheme which seems to have within it the likelihood of success should be tried. The expected revival in trade, for which we have waited so long, and whichIwas to bring us back to normal conditions, has been disappointingly delayed. The causes of a world shortage of consumption and a world wide dislocation of industry a unfortunately still remain. It would then appear that the present condition may remain constant for some considerable time to come. In some of our most important national ^industries the depression is intensified, and the unemployment lis becoming more severe. The condition is worse now than it gwas this time last year.I Four successive Governments have endeavoured to grapple feith the difficulties of the problem, and the remedies so far pporked out have proved inadequate, though a considerable femount has been achieved. One million and a quarter men i&amp;nd women are out of employment; hundreds of thousands of
them have been continually out of employment for months and even years. Since the Armistice the country has spent nearly  300,000,000 on unemployment benefit, out-of-work donation and. poor-relief to the able-bodied. The country has received no return for this terrific expenditure. The workers themselves cry out for work and not for the &quot;dole&quot;; while the inherited and acquired skill of generations is being dissipated by enforced idleness. Many of our best and more experienced workers are leaving the country. New generations of youths, who would otherwise have become skilled workmen, start their life&apos;s journey by wandering untrained and unskilled about the streets of our cities and towns. This is a state of affairs which is as detri-mental to the nation as it is unfair to the individual.the object of the scheme.I would desire to emphasize immediately what the object is of my scheme. It is to get people employed. Let us fii our eyes upon the real problem getting the workers back to work. Owing to the fact that the Unemployment Insurance Benefit is, as far as covenanted benefit is concerned, a legal right, the scheme should be a voluntary one. For the purposes of the scheme I am treating all benefits as covenanted. The sole object is to provide work for those workers who are prepared voluntarily to surrender their benefits in return for definite employment. The work would be provided in the industry in which they have been brought up, and at the work to which they are accustomed.outline of the scheme.The following is an outline of the scheme: 1. Employers, after referring their case to a committee, which I describe below, would notify the Employment Exchanges of the number of new workers they would tab into employment on full time at full trades union rate for a definite period (say, for example, six months) in excess of the average number fully employed by them during to six months preceding the &quot;appointed day.&quot;2. The &quot;appointed day&quot; would be a date defined in the legislation which would have to be passed to make this
scheme effective. The date would presumably have to be the day upon which the adoption of the scheme by the Government was first made public.3. In respect of seventy-five per cent, of the wcxrkers actually engaged as the result of the above notification, the employer would be entitled to receive the Unemployment Benefit of 23s. a week due to those workers from the Labour Exchange through which he engages the men.4. The cards of all workers who had been continuously unemployed for three out of the six months preceding the &quot;appointed day,&quot; and who had notified the Exchange of their willingness of coming under the scheme, would be stamped by the Employment Exchange in order to ensure that these men would be the first to be employed under the new scheme.5. Any firm set up after the &quot;appointed day,&quot; with the exception of schemes for the employment of unemployed ex-service men, would receive the seventy-five per cent, of the Unemployment Benefit only in respect of half the total number of men employed by them through the Labour Exchange, that is, only in respect of thirty-seven and a half per cent, of the total number employed. Moreover, the firm would have to prove commitments into which it had entered before the &quot;appointed day,&quot; and would have to start operations within three months of the scheme coming into effect. Such commitments should preferably be proved before the special Unemployment Committee defined below.6. So that the scheme might end automatically when the greatest need for it had been met, the number of men and women for whom the employer would receive the 23s. per week would have to be reduced at the end of a six months&apos; period after the &quot;appointed day,&quot; and subsequently at the end of every three months&apos; period by 2 per cent, more than the percentage reduction in unemployment in their industry, as ascertained by the Ministry of Labour since the date when the scheme began to operate. For the purpose of this calculation, the total number employed under the scheme would be included amongst the unemployed.
7. The scheme should end automatically when a reduction to normality in the unemployment figures is reached, and this figure should be stated in the legislation -   necessary to put the scheme into effect.8. The scheme would apply to men, women and youths &quot;- - in all insured industries in which the unemployment figures were above normality.9. Employers, for the purposes of the scheme, would include all industrial companies, local authorities, and public utility undertakings, that is to say, every class of employers of labour.Local organisations could be set up, such as already exist in the unemployment committees; such organisations to represent the employers, the Trades Unions and the State, in proportion to their contribution to the Unemployment Fund. The Employers&apos; Panel could adjust matters affecting employers alone. The Trades Union Panel could adjust matters relating to those who are about to be employed. Applications by an employer requiring labour should be made to the committee, who could adjust matters affecting the various panels, and general points at issue. The committees could deal with each application on the facts of the particular ease. It would be for the committee to decide whether the granting of such an applica-tion would or would not increase the total volume of trade, and therefore of employment. On the application being granted, fc employer would notify the nearest Labour Exchange of the number of additional workers he had been allotted and when those workers were to start work.LIMITED APPLICATION.This is a broad outline of the scheme. While I am convinced myself that the scheme could profitably be applied to all industries in which the percentage of unemployment is above normality, owing to the novelty of the proposals it might be necessary in the first instance to give the scheme a limited application. It could, for instance, at first be limited to certain definite and organised industries. Naturally, those industries which are most severely beset by unemployment at the present time would be the most appropriate to commence with.   Ship-
building, engineering, and mining would probably be the most suitable industries to limit the application at first. These industries are localised in well-defined areas; shipbuilding and engineering have suffered a long period of acute depression. The present percentages of unemployment in them are 33 per cent, and 13-3 per cent, respectively. If the principle of the scheme proved successful in these industries, it could easily be extended later.objections answered.All kinds of objections, some serious, and some frivolous, have been urged against the scheme. Many of these objections are completely answered by the statement of the scheme which I have given above. Others are based on misconceptions or ignorance of the true nature of British industry to-day. A useful purpose might, however, be served if we considered a number of objections which have been most commonly urged against the scheme. The scheme has been carefully considered, and endeavours have been made to meet every serious objection which has been raised. In the thrashing out of such a scheme other points may arise which have not occurred to me. These ought to be dealt with on their merits when they crop up.First and foremost, it is stated with a wearying reiteration that the scheme contravenes the sacred principles of economics. It really makes me tired to hear a shibboleth repeated with such uncompromising hostility to any. new idea or proposal. Those who urge it most frequently live completely in the mists of academic speculation. They have no experience of the hard practical side of life. Impressed by their own superiority, they fail to take note of the misery and suffering which is going on around them. When the house is on fire they would seek to let it destroy their children because their furniture was insured! What if the principles of the proposals contravene orthodox economic principles? Progress in all spheres of life and action has often been promoted by the heterodox rather than the orthodox.the speenhamland system.I am told that the scheme is economically unsound because it is a subsidy on wages, and would produce the results of the
&quot;Speenhamland Act&quot; and the Poor-law system before the Poor-law Commission of 1832. Why people should be so afraid of the word &quot;subsidy&quot; I cannot understand. Is it not better to subsidise employment rather than to subsidise unemployment as we are doing to-da.y ? The scheme does not subsidise industry, it merely subsidises the workless in order to enable them to obtain work. The scheme has little, if anything, in common with the Speenhamland system. In the first place the conditions of industry, of industrial organisation, and domestic and social life are entirely different to-day from what they were a hundred years a,go. The problem which faces the country to-day is absolutely dissimilar from the problem which faced the post-Waterloo era. Probably more false assumptions and historical inaccuracies have gathered round the Speenhamland system than around any other problem of a similar nature. Many admit that the influence of the old poor-law was grossly exaggerated by 19th century writers. Briefly, the position was, that the Government of the day had to face the problem of how they could provide means to keep those who were at work in agri-culture still at work. The subsidy devised was unlimited, uncontrolled. The scheme was no part of a coherent plan, not was it thought out. There were no limitations or restrictions, The whole basis was wrong, but however demoralising may have been the effects, in various directions, the system did at least help to tide Britain over a period of dire economic distress.THE SCHEME COMPARED.The Speenhamland system provided no datum line. M; scheme provides a satisfactory datum line,-the average number employed by each firm in the six months preceding the &quot;appointed day.&quot; There could therefore be no question oi dismissing men and re-engaging them in order to get the subsidy. My scheme is a considered plan, adequately controlled, scient-i-fically founded with the necessary precautions against the risk of abuse.Under my scheme, the subsidy is not paid out of State funds, but out of a particular source to the total of which the State contribution is the smallest of the three constituent elements, The Unemployment Fund is something distinct and separate,
9   &amp;contributed by the employers and employees, and already sub-subsidised by the State, both by its normal contribution to the Fund, and by loans, which owing to the heavy drain upon the Fund have to be made from time to time to keep it from liquidation. Moreover, the application of the subsidy is hedged in by restric-tions adequately controlled. Provided -the scheme be properly administered, the risk even of any considerable abuse is very-small.the labour party and the scheme.It is stated in various quarters that the Labour Party would not accept the scheme because it would tend to lower the general rates of wages. In support of this contention it is urged that the Speenhamland system lowered wages generally throughout the country. The scheme definitely provides that those who accept work under it receive full time employment at full Trades Union rates of wages. Those who imagine that any attempt, even if made, could lower the general rates of real wages in this country, must be deplorably ignorant of the purpose and strength of the Trades Union movement. When the scheme is in operation, the Trades Union rates of wages would still be deter-mined in the same way as they are to-day. No employer is foolish enough to be likely to attempt to reduce wages because the scheme is in operation.Another point which is urged on the labour side of the question is that it would be undesirable to have workmen working side by side, some of whose labour would be subsidised and others not. Out of every 100 workmen taken on, the employer would receive the unemployment benefit only in respect of 75. Who could say which of the 100 additional workers taken on were subsidised and which were not ? In any case, it is merely cavilling to raise an objection of this nature against a scheme which is, after all, the only concrete series of proposals to provide work for the unemployed which is before the country.employers and the scheme.In some quarters it is urged that the scheme would stimulate production by one employer at the expense of others-, that- new firms would be set up merely to take advantage of the scheme,
that employers would naturally discharge men at present employed, and re-engage them in order to get the advantage of their unemployment benefit; that the operation of the scheme would be inequitable as between firm and firm because it jg pointed out one firm might be relatively fully employed on Current contracts and temporary orders, while another firm, through the completion of contracts and the lack of temporary orders, would have much less than its average number oj employees on its wages list.safeguards of the scheme.Under the machinery of the special Unemployment Com-mittee which I have provided, firms have to convince a bodyol men, representative of the employers, the Trades Unions, an! the State, of the reasonableness of their ability to provide wort for the additional number of men they can take on. New firm could not possibly be set up merely in order to take advantajt of the scheme, because they have to prove commitments on tin &quot;appointed day.&quot; Moreover, the benefit they receive afta proving such commitments is only one-half of what existing firms would be entitled to receive.It would be quite impossible for employers to discharji men, and then re-engage them in order to obtain their unemployment ment. benefit. The scheme applies to additional workers onlj, It is definitely laid down that the scheme should apply only!) workmen in excess of the average number employed by any fim in the six months preceding the &quot;appointed day.&quot; This provider a double safeguard, and moreover, it covers the objection that tin scheme would be inequitable in its operation as between fin and firm because on the &quot;appointed day&quot; one firm was relativelj fully employed and the other firm relatively under employed.employers and the present position.Again, it is objected that wages are but a very varyinj proportion of the total costs in different industries. But in tii industries where labour costs bear a small proportion to thetotsl costs, the employers&apos; contribution to the Unemployment Funl also bears a small proportion to the total costs.   Therefore, then
9 fi ^can be no valid reason why such an industry should object to a subsidy to an industry in which labour costs bear a high proportion to the total costs.Further, it is surely time when it should be realised that all engaged in industry view the present position with the bravest apprehension. They are not in a mood to be moved by petty jealousies or minor considerations. If captains of industry were sterilised by pedantry and narrowness, industry would soon vanish completely from this country. They are accustomed to take a broad and comprehensive view of any position. They are not moved by pettifogging motives and petty personal greeds.the  financial  saving.The suggestion that in some cases the grant made to the employers would be more than was needed to stimulate and cheapen production, and that there would, therefore, be a waste of public money, leads me to a further consideration of the financial results of the scheme. Immediately and directly the scheme begins to function there is a saving to the Fund of the benefits of 25 per cent, of the total number of people employed under the scheme. In other words, for every thousand people who obtain work under the scheme, the Insurance Fund saves  287 10s. per week. Say, for example, that in the first six months period no more than 100,000 workers are employed under the scheme, in that time, and from one source alone, there is a total saving to the Fund alone of  747,500. The purchasing power of those engaged under the scheme will be very much greater than at present, and this will provide employ-ment for many in other industries who are at present in receipt of Unemployment Benefit. Besides subsidiary and ancillary trades which would immediately benefit by the supply of raw (materials, semi-finished materials and plant, the industries con-cerned with transport and communication, with building, textiles, food and distribution would benefit. For example, at the present time there is an unemployment percentage of 14.6 in the fishing industry. Nearly 50,000 persons belonging to the food industries are unemployed, while there are over 100,000 employed in the distributive trades.     In addition, the full
contribution will be paid to the Unemployment Fund by the employers, the employees and the State in respect of all those who are employed under the scheme and the others who will be in full employment on account of the adoption of the scheme.Nor is this the only way in which the country will benefit I financially. There will be a consequent reduction in taxation and the poor rate. It is not sufficiently realised that the Unem-ployment Benefit is supplemented in many cases by poor relief J as the Unemployment Benefit itself is inadequate. It is not sufficiently understood that a high poor-rate operates as a heavy charge on industry. It is a heavy charge when industry is most depressed; it is a direct cause making it difficult for our industries to compete in the export&quot;markets. Any scheme, therefore, which would tend to lower rates or taxes, would in itself stimulate industrial revival throughout the country.fair all round.It is urged that it would not be possible to subsidise industries, whereas if certain industries, such as shipbuilding,! were favoured, it would be purely at the expense of other! industries. The scheme is one to provide employment and i get people back to work in those industries in which unemployl ment is greatest. It is obvious those industries in whiclj unemployment is fortunately less severe will not require h\ application of the scheme. Why should they object if they i losing nothing ? How would it be at the expense of other industrial if shipbuilding were subsidised ? Does not shipbuilding draw i raw materials from other industries ? If shipbuilding alone bi[ subsidised, would not engineering benefit? Would not s benefit ? Would not the coal mining industry benefit ? And ( of these and many others, would they not benefit directly immediately ?Again, it is urged that it would be unfair to pay out of ttsj Unemployment Fund, which is derived from all industries,! sum of money to particular industries, since the other industrial contributing to the Fund might protest.   If we were to oonsMa the protests of every individual on every conceivable point result would be anarchy.   In the Unemployment Fund t are three parties whose interests are involved.   Because tif
ct n n   0 Sminor fraction of one interest might protest, is nothing to be done? Has anything ever been done in this world, which is worth doing, which has not aroused the protests of some factious minority ?provision for termination.Among objections urged against the operation of the scheme it is asked how could it be determined when these payments to employers should stop ? That question is amply answered in the statement of the scheme above. The scheme is to end automatically when the greatest need for it has been met. The number of workers for whom the employer would receive the 23s. per week is to be reduced at the end of a six months period after the &quot;appointed day,&quot; and subsequently at the end of each three months&apos; period by 2 per cent, more than the percentage reduction in unemployment in their industry. When normality in the unemployment figures is reached, the scheme ends auto-matically. The other objection contained in the question, who would decide when the employer was doing well enough to dispense with such help does therefore not arise.the profits problem.It seems strange that the most considerable objection which could have been taken to the bald outline of the scheme which has hitherto been announced has missed the critical eyes of those who have been out to seek nothing but objections. It relates to the question of profits. Should the total profit, if any is made, by any firm receiving the subsidy be retained by such firm ? It has to be remembered that in entering into con-tracts, especially more or less speculative contracts, it is always possible to make a loss as easily as it is possible to make a profit. Some inducement is needed to stimulate business. It would be a very one-sided bargain if all the profits were taken by the community, and all the loss sustained by the individual. It would also be a one-sided bargain if, when a subsidy is paid out of the Unemployment Fund, all the profits were retained by the firm. A scheme should, therefore, be devised by which, where a subsidy on wages is paid for the extra men, the
amount of the total subsidy paid over a six months or a twelvi months period should be proportioned to the entire wage biOrf, the works employing the additional men, and the profits of ftjl works proportioned in the same way. For instance, where % amount received from the Unemployment Fund is five per eest of the total wage bill of the works, the Fund would be entity to receive five per cent, of the total profits made at that worj and so on in proportion to the percentage of the amount reoeir: from the Fund to the total wage bill of the works.the return to normality.From what I have said above on the financial side of scheme, it is a fallacy to suppose that if the Unemployn Benefit is utilised to get people back to work, the unemployment Fund will be more burdened than if the scheme is not adop1 This is not the case. The amount of benefit paid out off Fund is, as I already pointed out, but 75 per cent. This is concrete saving. Can it be assumed that if nothing is done,!! the men will be engaged in industry in the ordinary way? Iff were so, of course, the Unemployment Fund would corns more cheaply than if the scheme were adopted. If this is thai to be likely, the whole scheme should not be proceeded On the other hand, all the indications are that in the near k there is likely to be no substantial increase in the number workers employed, unless some such scheme as I have sugg:. is adopted. Experience has taught us in the last four j that we cannot rely upon the return to normality coming al by itself.If trade were improving at the present time there be some force in the contention that there is nothing is scheme to prevent the subsidy being paid in respect of Is! which would have obtained employment in any event in quence of the improvement in trade. That improvement. to be very slow; the country has been waiting for years fo( improvement to take place; it has not happened; nobodr any certainty of it happening in the near future. The contingency suggested is, therefore, rather remote, while w faced with the immediate danger of perpetual Unemployment
effect upon insurance acts.One serious objection which has been raised is that the scheme would injure the present Unemployment Insurance Acts, and that objection would be taken by the Labour Party on the grounds that the contributions of the workers which had been given to provide Unemployment Benefit should be diverted to other purposes. I have always entirely failed to understand this reasoning. As I have already pointed out the Unemployment Fund is definitely benefitted, not injured by the scheme. The scheme is voluntary; it is therefore optional whether the benefit is surrendered or not. Those who obtain work, after all, have been and again will be contributors to the Fund. The scheme entitles them to use their benefit to obtain such a real advantage as a return to work. Therefore neither the worker contributor in work, nor the worker out of work who benefits stands to lose. Both stand to gain. If the scheme were compulsory there might be some strength in the above contention; being voluntary there is none. It is inconceivable to me that those who profess to speak for the workers and claim almost a monopoly of interest in solving the unemployment question would declare themselves opponents of the proposal which will do so much to solve the evil they deplore.Why should any contributor object to the Unemployment Fund being used to provide work rather than to keep a man in unemployment ? A man is now unemployed. He only becomes employed by means of the use of the benefits arising from the contributions paid to the Fund. Why should any contributor object to this ? What advantages is he supposed to derive ? The fact is that the man is walking about the streets doing nothing but drawing money. What loss does any contributor suffer by the fact that this man is put to work ? Most of the unemployed are Trades Unionists. The Trades Unions provide an unem-ployment benefit as well as the benefit obtained from the Unem-ployment Fund. By the adoption of the scheme, Trades Union funds would also be relieved. Everybody pays rates. Contri-butions to the rates come down, a man in employment becomes i consumer, which helps to put others into employment.
foreign trade and other countries.A number of objections relate to foreign trade, and attitude which foreign countries will adopt. It is suggested t even if a subsidy were given, it does not follow that foreigJ orders would flow in, since we cannot control conditions abroad Others think that a policy of giving a subsidy would produce: reaction on other countries. The mere impression that il British Government is subsidising British producers would I nsed by foreign competitors as an argument for extracting si! sides from their own Government. It is true that we could n; control conditions abroad after the adoption of the scheme a more than we can control those conditions to-day. On fj other hand, Britain would be able to produce goods mj cheaply than she can to-day, and it would certainly i that she would then be in a more favourable position to compej with the new European countries, and the countries from depreciated currencies, than she is to-day.On the second point, why should we concern ourselves nij possible re-actions on other countries, if the scheme will helpo: unemployed, as I feel confident that it will ? We surely ougntj proceed without regard to what possibly may occur in otl countries.   Those other countries always have, and always i proceed on what they consider will benefit them, best with any regard as to whether our population is employed or unaj ployed.   I have never met a continental statesman who has expressed in unequivocal language, his utter amazement I such    state of unemployment  as  we  have had for years Britain should be allowed to exist.   They cannot understi why we have not found work for our workless.   It is a eondit of things which would not be tolerated on the continent.the certainty of success!One of the most astounding objections I have heard rsl against the scheme, and it naturally comes from official souis is that it is not certain that the object of the scheme, the res tion in prices, and hence increased production and trade, be realised. Nothing in the world is certain, except that official mind  invariably attempts  to  torpedo any suggef
which would retrieve any situation, however serious. Of course, it is not certain that prices will be reduced, and production increased. It is not certain that the sun will rise to-morrow, or that the Palace of Westminster will not be turned into a drapery establishment. The presumption is, however, that the 8un will rise, and that the Palace of Westminster will be con-tinued to be used for the deliberations of Parliament. The presumption too, is that when the employer applies to the Committee, and is allowed additional workers, for 75 per cent, of whom he will receive the sum of 23s. per week, that the cost of production will go down. The presumption also is that when the cost of production goes down, prices will be reduced, both in the home and the export markets. The presumption is that reduced prices will lead to a bigger demand, and finally the presumption is that the bigger demand will lead to increased production.advantages of scheme summarised.I would like, briefly, to summarise the advantages of the scheme. The chief cause of post-war unemployment has been the diminished volume of our export trade. Our export trade has failed to recover its volume because our prices have been too high. Our prices have been higher than those of our com-competitors because our cost of production has been higher. The problem which faces the country is, how can the cost of produc-tion be brought down so that employers can obtain contracts nd orders ?a concrete example.In proof of how the scheme would assist to solve the problem here is a concrete example which I have quoted on several casions before, but, it bears repetition. A large shipbuilding hi received a tender for the construction of two motor oil nkers. The estimated net cost of production of each vessel the firm was  218,306, of which  162,000 represented labour arges, of 54,000 men-weeks at an average of  3 per week, e price of the foreign competitor was  12,000 less per vessel, labour charges could be reduced by that amount the contract uld be got.   Now, 54,000 men-weeks at 23s., the amount of
the unemployment benefit, totals  62,100.   For a payment  12,000 the country   could   save over    50,000 per vessel i unemployment benefit a total of over  100,000 on this singll contract a definite saving to the contributions of employee employees, and to the taxpayer.Alternatively, if 13,913 men-weeks out of the total j 54,000 per vessel represented additional labour engaged und; my scheme, 10,435, or seventy-five per cent, only, of whi would be directly subsidised at a. total cost to the Fund  12,000, the contract could be got. Out of a total cost  218,306, of which  162,000 represent labour charges, the total subsidy out of the Fund would be but  12,000.costs and prices.The scheme would, therefore, enable British industries j provide employment not only for those additional men taken; under the subsidy, but, for many others. It would pro?; work for the unemployed work in the industry in which heh been trained. It replaces him in normal work under conditia which in almost every respect are normal. By reducing then of production it would enable Britain to recover her lost exp trade.The only secure basis for trade recovery is a level of csj which will enable us to supply our customers at prices they! afford and which our foreign competitors cannot undercut, is an excellent doctrine, but, how can it be made practical)! The temporary application of the scheme gives the answer. &apos; gulf which separates buyers&apos; prices from sellers&apos; prices is namj It is a gulf caused almost entirely by high rates and taxes, tuj due to the demands of unemployment itself.   The gulf cai bridged, I sincerely believe, by the adoption of some such sc&apos; as I have outlined.no additional burden.Even if completely unsuccessful in its main object&apos; provision of work it can cost the taxpayer nothing.   It adi additional burden upon the State.   If successful, even only: slight degree, it eases the onerous burden upon the ta and the ratepayer.   The more successful the scheme is the
progressive becomes the easing of that burden, until the. cumulative effect might eventually eradicate the post-war canker of unemployment completely from our industrial system.RELIEF IN RATES AND TAXES.The relief in rates and taxes which even the modified success of the scheme would assure, would lead to reduction in overhead charges, which would, in itself, stimulate production. It is too seldom realised, how in times of depression, when economies in every direction are so essential, in order to keep the industrial machine going at all, that those items in overhead charges representing rates and taxes tend to increase, while on account of diminished production, the other items must inevitably assume a greater proportion to the total costs per unit. Reverse the process. Instead of progressive and cumulative depression, kindle the spark of industrial revival. With increased produc-tion all the items iu overhead charges diminish naturally, in proportion to the increase in production. Add at the same time reduced rates and taxes to the other factors, and production follows production, and progress follows progress. I claim that the adoption of my scheme will reverse the wheel.PROVIDES WORK FOR WOMEN.It is the only scheme put forward so far, which is designed to provide work for the workers at their own trade. It is also the only unemployment relief scheme which has provided any remedy for the unemployed woman. For the scheme would be applicable equally to industries which employed men only, men and women, and women only. It also applies to youths, to those who have never yet had an opportunity of acquiring a trade or a craft, and whose future prospects under the prevailing conditions of affairs are dark and dismal.OUR INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM ON TRIAL.I sincerely trust that neither prejudice nor indifference will be allowed to prevail. The position is much too serious. Our whole industrial system is arraigned by its failure to deal with the problem of unemployment. If any scheme will help to solve t, it is certainly to the interests of those who generally believe
that the maintenance of the established order of society is essential to the well-being of the country, to use every endeavour to see that it is adopted. In 1834 there was no great Socialist Party threatening to destroy the fabric of society. We have to face fundamental facts. There may be those who rejoice, hoping that the persistence of the unemployment evil will provide the acceptance of a new and dangerous economic system in which the whole of industry and life would be jeopardised. Our reigning economic system cannot justify itself unless it solves this, the greatest of our industrial and social problems.AN APPEAL FOR ACTION.If it is a matter of unimportance to the community whether its industrial population deteriorates, whether its trade leaves its shores, whether despair, despondency and unrest enter the hearts of its workers, whether a generation of worthless, workless citizens grows up, if human suffering is of no account, and there is no evil for us to remedy, then such objections to the schemi are excellent.   They enable us to do nothing with a tranquil conscience.   They are the everlasting refuge of the do-nothings, the weapons of the sand-Iaaggers  of   all  reform.   No periled scheme can be produced.   Every scheme would be subject to modification in practice.    Every action incurs risk.   The worli is full of inequity.   All those who feel we cannot continue as si present, all those who feel that we have continued thus to long, will, be prepared to take some risks, and if they are pre pared to risk such reasonable contingencies as they can th&apos; of, they will go forward with sufficient courage and faith themselves to solve a problem full of difficulties a probl which can no longer be ignored.The scheme is, after all, an honest endeavour to help solve a problem which is sapping the moral fibre, the phyJ.; stamina, and the industrial efficiency   of the nation.   If problem is not solved the result may be worse than any prop can foretell.    For the sake of humanity  a solution must attempted.Printed by James Davies and Co., Ltd., &quot;South Wales Press,&quot; Lls&quot;.
