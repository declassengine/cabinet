IThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1    459Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1925.SECEET.(Ministry of Labour Industrial Memoranda Serial No. 2.)CP. 237 (25).CABINET.ENGINEERING  TRADES.NEGOTIATIONS between the Engineering and Allied Employers&apos; National Federation and the trade unions in the engineering industry have been proceeding since April 1924 on a claim for an advance of  1 per week made by the Unions on behalf of their members empkwed in the Engineering Trades.Organisation of the Industry.2. (a.) The Engineering and Allied Employers&apos; National Federation consists of about 60 local associations, organised in districts with a central council and a whole-time Chairman (Sir Allan Smith).(6.) With regard to the skilled Unions, organisation has proceeded since the close of the 18th century from district craft societies to national amalgamations^ but amalgamation is not yet by any means complete. The largest organisation, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, was formed in July 1920 and was composed of the following bodies, which had up to that time had a separate existence : The Amalgamated Society of Engineers.United Machine Workers&apos; Association.United Kingdom Society of Smiths and Strikers.Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society.East of Scotland Brass Founders&apos; Society.Associated  Brass  Founders,  Turners,  Fitters,  Finishers   and   CopperSmiths&apos; Society.

In 1923--24 it had diminished even more, but a vigorous campaign in the largest engineering centres has led to some recovery in the last six months.The other organisations concerned in the present negotiations are : The Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, comprisingtwenty-two Unions. * Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders.

Society of Scale, Beam and Weighing Machinists. Constructional Engineering UnionWage Rates.3. Wages in the engineering industry have varied according to district, and the system of &quot; district rates &quot; has continued until the present time. The time rate in London (which may be given as a typical district) prior to the war was 405. Qd. for fitters and 22s. to 26s. for unskilled men for a week of 54 hours.As a result of increases given during and after the war, mainly by arbitration awards, the rate of wages of fitters reached in 1920 93s. 8^d. and that of labourers 74s. 10d., the working hours being reduced by agreement to 47 per week. From July 1921 to September 1922 various reductions took place, as a result of which the present rate in London for fitters is 60s. lid. and for labourers 43s. 3\d. This includes a war bonus of 10s. The amounts actually earned by individual men may differ from these rates, especially where piece-work is worked.*The rates are lower in some other districts, such as the Clyde and East Anglia, and are somewhat higher in the Bristol Channel, where the employers are organised in a separate federationThough the Engineering and Allied Employers&apos; National Federation endeavours fairly successfully to keep a tight hold over its members and to prevent any serious departure from the district rates, there are many establishments where skilled men under systems of piece-work or premium bonus, or by means of special ability rates, have substantially higher earnings. Generally speaking, however, the position of engineering workers has become very unfavourable as compared with that of workers in other industries, such as building, the electrical trades, printing and transport, and, in fact, the standard rates and the actual earnings of most skilled engineers are reduced below those of some unskilled or only partially skilled classes. There is no other equally large body of highly skilled men which is suffering so severely from the position of the &quot; unsheltered &quot; industries.* The Ministry has no official information as to the amounts actually earned, but the following figures, which were recently supplied by the Engineering and Allied Employers&apos; National Federation to Sir Arthur Balfour&apos;s Committee, as showing the average earnings in different classes of the Engineering Industry in July 1914 and April 1924 in shillings per week, are of interest in this connection: 	Amount of Earnings.

Negotiating Machinery.4. Procedure for the settlement of differences in the engineering trades was set up in 1898 at the end of a protracted dispute concerning an eight-hours day and the employers&apos; insistence on their right to introduce what new methods of working they chose and new systems of remuneration according to results. These &quot; Provisions for Avoiding Disputes &quot; have been embodied in later agreements from time to time. In 1907 a revised agreement was made which lasted until its termination in 1913. Other agreements were made until on the 13th June, 1922, the agreement at present in operation was made. It provides means whereby a question arising in the-workshop may be settled in the works, failing which, after intermediate steps, it may be carried to a local conference and, failing settlement there, to a national conference. It is laid down that, &apos;&apos; Until the procedure provided above has been carried through, there shall be no stoppage of work either of a partial or a general character.&quot;The industry covers a very wide range of manufacture, and workshop practice and organisation vary greatly, even on similar or identical products. Moreover, there are great differences in the prosperity of different branches; in some, such as motor-car manufacture, trade is good, while in others, such as marine and other heavy engineering, depression is acute. Nevertheless, it has long been the custom to negotiate on a uniform basis for all sections, and flat increases and decreases have been put into operation. The procedure outlined above has, as a rule, been strictly observed by both sides, and the industry as a whole has for some time been accustomed to pursue the full course of negotiation before allowing any serious stoppage to occur, and before asking for, or, indeed, tolerating, any State intervention. The last serious stoppage was in March 1922, when, as a result of a disagreement on. &quot;managerial functions,&apos;&apos; and after all machinery had been exhausted, the Employers&apos; Federation declared a lock-out. The Minister of Labour set up a Court of Inquiry; after it had reported, a settlement was reached.History of Recent Negotiations.5. It is not surprising that for the last two or three years there should have been wide-spread discontent throughout the Trade Unions at their position, and it is remarkable that they should have tolerated it for so long. The reason is partly the mitigations referred to above which have been effected in: individual establish-ments;.partly a more or less sub-conscious recognition on the part of the most sensible of the rank and file that employers in general were not making profits and that there was a real and serious depression of trade; partly, also, the existence of well-established negotiating machinery. It has also to be borne in mind that the increase in the use of machinery for the purpose of performing operations formerly- carried out by skilled workers has increased the amount of work which is capable of being carried out by semi-skilled or unskilled labour, and has facilitated the wider applica -tions of piece-work systems of working. The Unions concerned with semi-skilled and unskilled workers naturally desire to secure as much of this work as possible for their members, and therefore, while all the Unions are acting together in respect of the present claim, their views on the manning of machines (i.e., roughly, the question whether the operating of a particula,r machine tool is to be regarded as work for a &quot;skilled &quot; or a &quot; semi-skilled &quot; man) a,nd on the working of piece-work, to which the skilled unions are, as a rule, officially opposed, do not always coincide. As the general position of the employers is that an increase of remuneration can only be secured by a greater productivity, the above circumstances have a bearing on the course of the negotiations.During the early part of 1924, wdiile the Unions in the engineering trade were considering the amount of the increases in wages to be demanded, the Engineering and Allied Employers&apos; National Federation invited all the Unions in the industry to a meeting &quot; to consider how far the present unsettling conditions in the industry could be avoided and the stability of the industry he, as far as possible, secured.&quot; This meeting was held on the 14th May, 1924. In the meanwhile, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, Electrical Trades &quot;Union, National Union of Foundry Workers, National Society of Coppersmiths, and the United Operative Plumbers&apos; Association had forwarded to the employers an application for an increase in wages of  1 per week.6. At the meeting on the 14th May, Sir Allan Smith, on behalf of   the Engineering Employers, made a statement on the position of the industry with reference to foreign competition, costs of production and the general difficulties of the trade, and suggested that an attempt should be made to remove the present [13094] b 2
unsettling conditions and secure stability. At the request of the Unions the meeting was adjourned for a week, and at the resumed meeting on the 22nd May, their representatives asked that before further discussion of the stabilisation of the industry a conference should be held to consider the applications which had been made for advances in wages. The Employers agreed, and a conference was arranged for the 5th June. Meanwhile, the other craft Unions, including the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation and the Boilermakers&apos; Society, and the unskilled Unions had joined with the A.E.U. in their claim for an increase of  1 a week.7. At the conference on the 5th June, 1924, the case of the men for an increase in wages was presented by the Unions, to which the Employers promised to give earnest consideration. At the resumed conference on the 2nd July, the Employers placed before the Unions statistics as to the state of trade and financial position of the industry, and appealed to them to allow a sufficient period to elapse to enable the industry to survive its present difficulties. The Unions pressed the Employers to make a definite offer in reply to their demand for  1 a week, and the conference was adjourned in order that the Employers might consult their constituents on this point.8. At the adjourned conference on the 16th July, Sir Allan Smith submitted additional figures on the state of trade, and stated that the industry could not bear the additional burden of an advance in wages. The Unions retired to consider this statement, and reached the following decisions :  &quot; (1.) We regret the Employers have made no counter-offer to our application for an advance.&quot; (2.) That our application stands.&quot; (3.) That the representatives of the Unions report back to their respective Executives, and that a conference of Union representatives meet in London on the 31st July to receive the reports of the Executives concerned.&quot;9.&apos;The Executives of Unions met as arranged on the 31st July and decided to appoint a Committee of one representative from each Union to examine and report on the statements submitted by the Employers. This Committee first met on the 12th August, when a Sub-Committee was appointed to confer with the Research Department of the Trades Union Congress General Council. The Sub-Committee met from time to time, and on the 23rd October asked the Employers&apos; Federation for additional information, which they said was necessary for a proper appreciation of &apos; the position. The Employers replied that the information required was not essential to the consideration of the figures which they had submitted, and they were unable v to supply it. The Committee of the Unions then arrived at the conclusion that, notwithstanding the financial position indicated by the figures supplied, the Unions were justified in pressing their claim, and recommended to the Unions that the Employers should be asked to send representatives to a joint meeting, so that the arguments in favour of the claim based on present conditions might be discussed. The conference of the Unions, which was held on the 11th December, endorsed the recommendation of the Committee, and asked the Employers for a meeting to be held early in January 1925 to resume negotiations on the demand for an increase of  1 a week.10. Negotiations were accordingly resumed on the 16th January, 1925, when the representatives of the Unions gave their reply to the statements on the position of the industry made at the previous conferences by the Employers, and stated that, if the Employers were unable to concede the full amount of  la week, they were prepared to consider any offer made by the Employers. In reply, the Employers stated that new points had been brought forward, and serious consideration would be given to the arguments that had been adduced. It was agreed to adjourn the conference in order to give the Employers an opportunity of consulting their local associations.11. The adjourned conference took place on the 10th and 11th February, 1925. The Employers stated that&apos;the present state and prospects of the industry did not warrant any increase in the costs of production, but that they were prepared to makfefli an advance, provided the Unions were prepared to discuss the manner in which the ; present working conditions might be amended so that there would be no increase in the costs of production; they suggested that a small joint Committee should be appointed for this purpose.   On being pressed as to what modifications in the
working conditions the Employers had in mind, Sir Allan Smith suggested that the Committee should discuss the following subjects: (A.) Restriction of output.(B.) Effect of reduction in hours on (i) day-shift, (ii) night-shift. (C.) Payment for overtime and night-shift and double day-shift and three-shift systems. (D.) Other elements affecting output. (E.) Stabilisation of wages.The Employers further proposed that the discussion should commence on the 17th February.The representatives of the Unions pressed for some counter-offer to their application for  1 a week increase, but the Employers would not go beyond the following statement : &quot;Provided the present working conditions can be amended so as to effect a reduction in the cost of production, the employers are prepared to recommend an advance, the amount and conditions thereof to be the subject of negotiation.&quot;12. Pressure by the Union representatives elicited no further offer and the position was accordingly reported to the various Executives. At a further Conference on the 5th March, the Unions informed the employers that they had considered the position as it was left at the Conference of the 11th February, and had come to the conclusion that there was no warrant for any interference with any of their present agreements, and they, therefore, requested the employers to state their decision in respect to the application for an increase of  1 per week. Following this, the Employers informed the Unions that in considering their reply they had had regard to the following : (A.) The lower rates of wages and longer working week in competitive countries. (B.) The facilities direct and indirect which are given to producers in thevarious competing&apos;countries by their Governments. (C.) The ability of continental countries to under-sell this country owing to thecontinued depreciation of their currencies. (D.) The abnormal credits given by foreign competitors in their efforts to capture the world&apos;s markets. (E.) The returns of the relation of manufacturing costs to selling values in 1924with a greater output show a much smaller credit balance than in 1923. (F.) Engineering imports are increasing as to value per ton and exports aredecreasing as to value per ton. CG.) The result&quot; is that there is great unemployment in this country onengineering products.The Employers then in effect repeated their former offer, that they would meet the Unions&apos; application as far as possible, if the Unions would &quot;bear their share-&apos; in avoiding increased cost of production.After&quot; considering the reply of the Employers the Unions stated that, in their opinion, it was a refusal to concede an advance in wages unless there was an agree-inent which would lower the present standard of working conditions, overtime and night-shift payments, and the acceptance of other proposals indefinitely stated; that the Executives of the Unions concerned had already intimated to the Employers that the Unions could not negotiate an advance in wages on such a basis, and under the circumstances they must regard the negotiations as terminated, and consider them-selves free to take such further steps as might be deemed necessary. The position was reported to a meeting of the Unions concerned on the 26th March.13. Negotiations having thus reached a deadlock, the Minister of Labour invited the two sides to meet him separately on the 26th March. One of the obstacles to progress was the difficulty of exploring any such question as the modification of working conditions in conferences consisting of a hundred persons aside. The Union representatives are suspicious of their spokesmen and of any proposal from the Employers to set up a negotiating committee. After discussion, the Minister suggested to each side that they should each appoint a small committee to meet and discuss the position. The Employers agreed. The meeting of Union representatives resolved to &quot;accept the Minister of Labour&apos;s suggestion to appoint a small Committee to meet a Committee of the employers to discuss the wage application.&quot;
14. The Joint Committees found it difficult to get beyond the wage application on account of the very definite restrictions in the Union representatives&apos; mandate, and adjourned in order that these might ascertain the possibility of getting wider powers. A conference of the Union Executives was arranged for the 23rd April, to receive the report from their Committee. Meanwhile the employers decided&apos; to send this conference something in the nature of an ultimatum, the terms of which were published in the press on the 24th April. The main items are, an increase in the day-shift hours from 47 to 50 per week, and in the night-shift hours from 47 to 52^; a reduction in rates at present payable under an Agreement of September 1920, from time and a half for the first two hours overtime to time and a quarter and in the night-shift rates from time and a third to time and a quarter; and an addition of 2s. a week (Is. on agreement being reached and Is. six months later) to the present 10s. bonus. The document included a suggestion that the Unions should join in approaching the Government on the question of the regulation of hours of work in competing countries.15. Although Labour writers and speakers have for some time been prophesying ah &quot;attack upon hours&quot; in several industries, the proposal has taken most of the Unions by surprise, and has aroused considerable indignation. The Employers&apos; change of tactics in making a definite proposal as to the alterations in working conditions which they desire was presumably inspired by a wish to bring home to the Unions the seriousness of the position in the industry. In their accompanying statement they lay stress upon the deterioration which has taken place during the last six months and the effects of the competition of foreign industry, with longer hours and lower wages. The feeling among the rank^and file upon the question of hours is strong and the wage increase offered, though no doubt it is not a final figure, is regarded as paltry. The Unions are consulting their Executives, and it is understood that it has been decided to refuse to accept the conditions offered when the further joint meeting is held this month. If, as a result, national negotiations break down, demands for increases are very likely to be pressed in sections or particular shops. The Unions are not in a position to finance a national strike, but in resisting the &apos;&apos; attack upon hours &apos;&apos; they can at least rely upon strong moral support from the whole Trade Union movement, and especially from those sections (notably the Miners and the Railwaymen) who are also at present engaged in wage negotiations.Ministry of Labour, May 1925.o
