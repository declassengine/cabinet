THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.MEMORANDUM    BY    THE    MINISTER    OF   LABOUR.1, I circulate herewith a draft of the Unemployment Insurance Bill.    The principal proposals,  apart from finance,  are:-(a) To restore the discretionary power to limit the grant of extended benefit (e.g. in the oase of married women, young single men and women,  etc)(b) To extend the power to. waive the &quot;30 contributions requirement&quot;,- whioh would otherwise oome fully into foroe en let October next.(o)    To extend the &quot;waiting period&quot; to a week, instead of the present three days.2,      At its meeting on 3Pth May the Cabinet decided also toreduce the weekly rate of benefit for single men and women fey3/-.    on further consideration,  and largely on account of the exigencies of parliamentary time,  it is not now proposed toinclude this in the Bill.3.     As to finance,  the Cabinet on 28th May decided that the contributions from employers and employed should in January next be reduced to 7d. each for men (as compared with lOd. and 9d, respectively at present) with corresponding reductions for women, boys and girls, and that the Exchequer contribution should be till January,  192P-,  a basic rate of Pd. for men (with corresponding figures for women, boys and girls) and in addition such further sum as might be necessary to prevent the debt of the Unemployment Fund from rising above the figure at whioh it stands at 31st December,  1925J    from January,  1926, until the end of the deficiency period the Exchequer baeio rate was to be reduced to 7d.SECRET.CABINET.CP.299(25). (REVISED).UNEMPLOYMENT    INSURANCE   BILL.A-
b4.      The Chancellor, I understand,  is unable to find more than Id, in excess of the basic rate of Fd.  (or 7d.) from the Exchequer, and the maximum Exchequer contribution must therefore be limited to 9d.  (or ad. from January,  192a). 5.      The amount of unemployment,  in the next twelve months, whioh,  in my opinion, we are bound to regard as possible or even probable, is an average figure of not less than 1,300*000 calculated on a comparable basis with present figures.    On this hypothesis, the revenue of the Unemployment Fund, with the new contributions and the Exchequer rate    limited to 9d., would be seriously insufficient to meet outgoings and the debt would be largely increased.6.     in order to meet in part this possible deficit it is now proposed to leave the employers1 contribution at Id. more (for men and women) than was previously proposed,coupling this, however, with a provision in the Bill that the Id, is to be taken off as soon as there is a reasonable prospect that without it the debt of the Fund can be kept below the level of next December.     The proposed contributions for employers and employed and those now in force are there-fore as follows:-Proposed Contributions,Tpresent ContributionsEmployerBefore further reduc-tion.In respect of men,; Rd,In respect of wonen, I 7d,In respect of boys. 4d.In respect of girls.; 3-gd.After further reduc-tion.jEmployed.!

It will be seen that as oompared with present contributions there Is a reduotion of 2d. in the contributions of both employers and emnloyed in the oase of men and Id. in the case of women,  beys and girls,  in January next,  and that the employer has a prosoeot of a further reduotion of Id. for
men and women and fd. for boys and girls, whereupon his rateB will be the same as those of the employed persons. P.      I am advised by the Government Actuary that the provisions of the Bill with regard to benefit will result in a saving of about  6,500,000 a year on the present live register of unemployed.9.      The reduced contributions from employers and employed as from January next (with the employer1s contribution at 8d. for men and 7d, for women) will be about  6,P00,000 less per annum than they are at present;    on the other hand the Exohequer contribution will be about  3,900,000 more than at present if the extra penny is included or  2,200,000 more, without this penny.     As oompared with its existing finance, therefore, the Unemployment Fund will be about  3,600,000 per annum better off than at present so long as the extra penny from the Exchequer Is paid and  1,400,000 better off when it is no longer payable.10.     On the other hand, the Fund is at present running into debt at the rate of  8,000,000 a year,  and it is not improbable I that the total deficit,  at present  9*000,000, will be ao much  * as  12,000,000 by the end of the next December.    If employment is on the average no better than it is at present the Fund, even with the extra penny from the Exchequer and the cuts in benefit,, proposed by the Bill, will be running into debt at the rate of  4,400,000 a year,  on top of the debt of next December, j and would not balance incomings and outgoings until the average register falls to a figure (calculated on the basis of present figures) of about 1,200,000.(intld.) A.  S-M.
Unemployment Insurance Bill.MEMORANDUM.The principal amendments made by this Bill in the Unemployment Insurance Scheme are as follows : (1) Extended benefit, instead of depending solely upon the fulfilment of the conditions expressly laid down in the existing Acts is to be allowed, subject to the conditions laid down in section 1 (3) of the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924, if the Minister of Labour &quot; having regard to all the circumstances of the case considers &quot; it expedient in the public interest&quot; to authorise the grant of such benefit.   (Clause l.((2) The power of the Minister to waive compliance with the &quot; first statutory condition,&quot; which at present expires on 30th September 1925, is extended to 30th June 1926. The &quot;first statutory condition &quot; requires payment of not less than 30 contributions since the beginning of the first two insurance years next before the beginning of the benefit year in which the application for benefit is made.   (Clause 2.)(3) The &quot; waiting period &quot; which must elapse before unemployment benefit is payable is increased from three days to a week.   (Clause 3.)141-5a
