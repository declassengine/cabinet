Printed fof the Cabinet.   May 1925.(Ministry of Labour Industrial Memoranda Serial No. 4.)CABINET. 30PROPOSED QUADRUPLE ALLIANCE.1. IN Jnne 1924 the South Wales Miners in conference decided by a large majority to ascertain the views of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and of other unions, including engineers, textile workers, building trade workers, iron and steel and all other productive workers, as to the formation of one big alliance, to be used for the purpose of presenting simultaneous programmes to the employers.2. The question was considered by the Miners&apos; Federation at their Annual Conference ifi July 1924, on a resolution put forward by the Forest of Dean miners &quot;That steps be taken to form an alliance with the National Union of Railwaymen, the Transport Workers&apos; Federation and any other Union where it is practicable.&quot;This resolution was discussed by the conference in private session, and it was then decided to refer the question to the Executive Committee for consideration.3. On the 23rd February, 1925, the Northumberland Miners&apos; Council passed the following resolution :  &quot; That we urge upon the Executive Committee of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain the absolute necessity of calling for international action in regard to the forthcoming conflict in the mining industry. Also that we take steps to establish the triple alliance of railway workers, transport workers and mine workers.&quot;Meanwhile, the Miners&apos; Federation had decided to approach the National Union of Railwaymen, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Transport Workers&apos; Federation, and invitations were sent to these bodies to meet the miners &quot;To discuss the question of rendering mutual support to our respective memberships in time of necessity.&quot;Replies from these organisations were considered at the National delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation, held at Blackpool on the 25th and 26th February. The conference instructed the Secretary to make arrangements for the meetings, such meetings to be preliminary to a meeting with the Trades Union Congress General Council.   It was stated by Mr. Cook subsequently to this conference that &quot; From the replies I have received, and the interest taken in this suggestion from the miners, I am confident that arrangements will be made for all the Unions to act together, co-ordinated by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress.&quot;&quot;It will be an alliance for action, and the suggestion of the Miners&apos; Federation is that all programmes should be submitted to this body and examined in order to secure united support before any struggle is decided upon. The alliance is a counterblast to the Federation of British Industries.&quot;4. On the 12th March the miners met first the Executive of the National Union of Railwaymen, and later the Executive of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation. It is doubtful how much progress was made at these meetings. At the conclusion of the first, the agreed announcement issued jointly by the leaders of the two bodies concerned simply stated that &apos;&apos; the position as affecting both organisations was discussed, the proceedings were largely informal and it is probable that a further [13090]SECRET. CP. 239 (25).
meeting will be held.;&apos; Nor was any more definite statement made in the report of the second meeting, which announced that &quot;After Mr. Herbert Smith and Mr. A. J. Cook had explained the objects of the meeting, Mr. Ben Tillett and Mr. Robert Williams presented the case for the Transport Workers&apos; Federation. A frank discussion took place on the whole position, which will be considered by both organisations, and subsequent meetings will be arranged.&quot;It may be mentioned, however, in regard to the meeting with the National Union of Railwaymen, that, while the National Union of Railwaymen in reply were sympathetic to the miners&apos; proposal, they stated that, as their &quot;all grades programme,&quot; designed to include the conditions of railwaymen, especially the lower paid workers, had to go through the constitutional machinery, the Committee could not definitely commit itself at the moment.The next day, on the 13th March, the Miners&apos; Federation again had two meetings, first with the Executive of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, followed by a conference with a Committee representing the 40 Unions concerned in engineering and shipbuilding. No information is available as to whether at these two meetings any progress was made further than a statement of the case by either side.On the 3rd April representatives of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union were met. At this meeting it appears that the proposals and objects of the Miners&apos; Federation were outlined to the leader of the Transport Workers&apos; Union, who promised that they should have the careful consideration of their Executive. A meeting between the miners and the Executive of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen has also been held, and a conference of all the Unions is to take place on the 6th June. In the meantime, it is of interest to note that a conference was held on the 26th April in Edinburgh between representatives of miners, railwaymen and engineers, the prime mover in the meeting being the Edinburgh. Trades and Labour Council. A Committee of Action was appointed to deal with present wages demands and organisation. This, however, is presumably a local movement only and not of any great importance.5. The significance of the proposed constituents of the Alliance must be measured in the light of the wages claims which have been made on behalf of the miners, engineers and railwaymen.In the mining industry the existing wages agreement expires in June 1925, and trouble is threatened unless the miners&apos; wages are made at least equal to the standard of 1914. The Minimum Wage Bill was introduced into the House last session in pursuance of this policy, but it was defeated on its second reading; but perhaps the most significant happening in the negotiations between the miners and the owners was the decision of the Miners&apos; Federation Executive on the 5th March to agree to the coalowners&apos; proposal for the appointment of a Joint Committee to investigate the whole economic position of the industry. The Joint ^ Committee has been set up, and its discussions are at present continuing. The position in the coal-mining industry is, however, grave, and unemployment is increasing; reports are continually being received of coal-mines being closed down. Considerable attention has been directed to the experiment at the Vauxhall Coal-Mine,- Ruabon, where the local miners have entered a Guarantee Fund to guarantee the owners against loss, while the mine, which would otherwise have been closed, is being run by the workers.In the engineering industry the Unions concerned submitted a claim ror an advance of  1 per week, but the employers decided that, unless the Unions were prepared to modify existing working conditions, they were not able to proceed with negotiations for a&quot; wages advance. Subsequently, on the 26th March, following a conference of Executive members of all the Engineering Trade Unions to determine future policy, the Unions and the employers agreed, on the suggestion of the Minister, to set up a Joint Committee to go thoroughly into the wages application. The Employers have since made an offer of an advance in wages contingent upon an increase&apos; in the working hours and modifications of the overtime and nightsnn arrangements. . jThe railwaymen also put forward an &quot;all-grades programme&quot; forJ?creaseu wages, which the Companies have met with a demand for a reduction,   lhe Lrr c Western Company further have faced the Unions with the three alternatives o:t eitne suspension of the guaranteed day and week, percentage reduction of wages dismissal of staff.
6. It is estimated that the Quadruple Alliance, if it matures, will be representa-tive of not less than 2^ million workpeople. It may, however, be assumed that the respective Unions are alive to the inherent difficulties of united action by so large a body particularly bearing in mind the circumstances which led to the break-up of the Triple Alliance in April 1921. The Labour Press Service admitted this in an article in which it said that, while all the Unions recognise the difficulties they have individually to face in fighting the employers at the present time, their leaders, &quot;while anxious to consider any proposals from the miners, are fully aware of the difficulty of planning simultaneous action in support of the claims now before the employers in the engineering, shipbuilding, mining and railway industries.&quot;7. It should be noted that it is not suggested that the proposed Quadruple Alliance should become an organisation independent of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, and it is therefore of interest to note the steps which are in process of taking place to secure greater co-ordination between all Trade Unions and closer co-operation between Trades Councils and the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, on the initiative of the General Council itself. A special Joint Committee, consisting of 6 representatives of Trades Councils and 6 representatives of the General Council, considered this matter. The Committee proposed to group the Trades Councils into areas, their functions to be to carry out the instructions of the General Council when emergencies arise, and to furnish the General Council with monthly reports of all their activities and all industrial developments- in their areas; the General Council on their side to furnish the Trades Councils with statements dealing with their activities and with general questions of Trade Union policy. These proposals were submitted to a conference of representatives of all Trades Councils and the General Council on the 27th February, 1925, when it was decided to put them into operation. Area industrial conferences of Trades Councils throughout England and Wales have been planned, and some have already been held at Birmingham, Darlington and Manchester. This aspect of unity of action will no doubt be considered when the miners meet the General Council after the series of meetings with the other suggested members of the Quadruple Alliance have been completed.8. There is a considerable divergence of interest among the component parts of the proposed alliance. The N.U.R. and, in the main, the Transport Workers belong to the group of &quot; sheltered &apos;&apos; industries. Their members are far better off individually than the miners and the engineers, and their more comfortable position does not arise out of higher skill or greater value to the community. They therefore tend to be regarded by their &quot; allies &quot; with more envy than affection. There is a long-standing feud between the N.U.R. and the A.E.U. over the position of craftsmen in railway workshops, and these two components are not likely to act harmoniously together. The miners have always been a segregated, self-contained community, entering little into daily intercourse with men of other callings. . The other unions will be under no-illusions as to the motives which have prompted their sudden desire for collaboration; these motives have no tinge of altruism. There is already a definite understanding for mutual support between the A.E.U. and the Transport Workers.9. Among the reasons for the collapse of the Triple Alliance were not only its unwielcliness, but the fact that it was a union of the leaders and not of the rank and file, and no confederation is likely to stand any severe strain which is not based upon some community of feeling among the rank and file. At present this exists only between the railwaymen and sections of the transport workers. The miners and the engineers, the miners and the railwaymen, the engineers and the railwaymen, have nothing in common. On the other&quot; hand, the &quot;Minority Movement,&quot; of which Mr. Cook is a prominent member, appears to be actively supporting the projected alliance, if, indeed, it did not inspire it. A number of the more active members of local branches in. all the unions concerned belong to this movement.10. It will be seen that the promoters of the Alliance have considerable difficulties to face, both in establishing it and in maintaining it, if established. On the other hand, the pending claims of three out of their four members will gain in momentum by joint action, and the &quot;attack &quot; by the engineering employers on the 48-hour week, if it is seriously pressed, will tend strongly to unity&quot;&apos; There is clearly a certain risk, even if no formal Quadruple Alliance is formed, of the deep-seated discontent among large sections of the rank and file bubbling over simultaneously into a widespread dispute.May 1925.
