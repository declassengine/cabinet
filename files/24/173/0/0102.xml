Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1925.SECRET. Copy No.    30CP. 300 (25).CABINET.EXPORT OF ARMS TO SOVIET RUSSIA.Compensation foe the Withdrawal and Non-Renewal of Licences.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Cabinet will recall that, following their decision of the 5th January to maintain their refusal to license the export of arms to Russia and to withdraw or to decline to renew, where they had lapsed, licences previously granted, applications were received from the firms concerned for compensation for losses suffered by them as a consequence of this decision. Upon this being reported to the Cabinet&apos; on the 21st January, I, with the President of the Board of Trade, undertook, at the invitation of our colleagues, &quot; to consider favourably the grant of compensation up to reasonable amounts to bond fide applicants who were able to substantiate their claims.&quot;The firms concerned are two only, viz., the Birmingham Small Arms Company and Messrs. Vickers, Limited, and the amounts in question are as follows: Birmingham Small Arms Company. Value. 200 Lewis Guns and spare parts, Russian 7&apos;62 mm.       calibre .... .... ... .... .... 19,992270 sets of Lewis Gun parts, English &quot;303-inch calibre.... 16,6053 Thompson Automatic Rifles, Russian calibre        ....       46337,060Vickers, Limited.136 sets of spare parts, 7&apos;62 mm. Russian calibre VickersHand-service Machine Guns      .... .... ....     9,100The total amount involved, assuming that none, of the material can be disposed of elsewhere, is thus  46,160.Neither the Admiralty nor the War Office nor the Air Ministry, all of whom have been consulted, are able to make use of any of the above material; and I have accordingly given very careful consideration to the question of compensation.No funds are available for the purpose, and it is clear therefore that any proposal of the kind would need a special Vote of Parliament by means of a Supplementary Estimate. There can be no doubt that such a Vote would be very difficult to justify and would be most unpopular in the House of Commons, where it would certainly be argued against the proposal 1. That the firms were engaged in what was admittedly a risky business in supplying arms to Soviet Russia under terminable licences, and that having accepted the risk they should be prepared to face the results.2. That for the sake of the large profits involved firms are always prepared to spend large sums of money in connection with contracts of this kind, and that a loss such as this is one of the risks incidental to the business of armament supply to foreign States.3. That they might be able to dispose of their munitions elsewhere. [13233]OOMFlDENTiAL LIBRARY,This Document is the Property of His Britannic majestys Government. &quot;T    ft
Finally, it seems to me that, in admitting the claim of an individual or firm to be compensated for failure to carry out a contract owing to the intervention of the Government on grounds of national interest, we should be creating a most dangerous precedent for the future and one that in its implications might have the most serious consequences upon the liberty of action of the Executive Government^I have therefore come to the conclusion that these claims should be refused and I invite my colleagues to concur in this view.w. s. c.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, June 20, 19^5.
