o) n na (6HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC   MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT. INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, GENEVA.----------------------------------------- J QSEVENTH SESSION,    MAY,    1925,PROPOSED INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DELEGATES. (Memorandum by the Minister of Labour).RET.The seventh session of the International Labour Conference .227will open at Geneva on Tuesday, the 19th May, 1926.     Appendix I.... reproduces for the information of the Cabinet the credentials.... of the British delegation to the Conference.     Appendix H sets out the agenda of the Conference.    The agenda was consideredby a meeting of the International Labour Committee on Monday,the 4th May.     In the light of the Committee*s recommendationsit is suggested that the following instructions should be givento the British Government delegates to the Conference.I would add that before the Conference begins the BritishGovernment delegates are hoping to meet some of the government delegates from the Dominions and India and I propose thatthese delegates or their representatives should be informedconfidentially of the action proposed by the BritishGovernment in regard to the various items on the agenda.I.      WORKMEN1S COMPENSATION;She International Labour Office haB suggested as bases for consideration by the Conference -i.     a proposed draft convention on workmen&apos;s compensation for accidentsjii.     a proposed draft convention on workmen&apos;s compensationfor occupational diseasesjiii.     a draft recommendation concerning the minimum scale of compensation;iv.     a proposed recommendation as to jurisdiction in disputes on workmen1 s compensation.I **.*.   Copies of these drafts will be found in Appendix III.
The proposed draft convention on workmen&apos;s compensation for accidents goes considerably beyond the present day law and practice of this or, it Is thought, any other country.   There appears to be little support for the proposal of the British Government that the Conference should limit itself to adopting a mere recommendation and in these circumstances the British Government delegates might be instructed to -1. work towards the adoption of a draft convention restricted to principles on which there is general agreement, any other matters with which the Conference may desire to deal being dealt with in a draft recommendation; ii, endeavour to bring any draft convention or recommendation into conformity as far as possible with or at any rate within the limits of the existing law and practice in Great Britain;111. not vote for the adoption of any draft convention or recommendation involving compulsory insurance or any other substantial extension or alteration of the existing law and practice In Great Britain, The proposed draft convention on workmen&apos;s compensation for occupational diseases, is, I understand, fully covered by our existing law as contained in Section 8 of the s-VorkmenTs Compensation Act, 1906, which is far ahead of the law of other countries.   The draft convention would therefore be valuable in bringing conditions abroad up to our level and the British Government delegates might oe instructed to^ supports any draft convention giving compensation for occupational diseases provided always it is in conformity with the principles of the British system.
The draft recommendations concerning the minimumscale of compensation and jurisdiction . in disputes onY/orkmen^ compensation are open in general to the sameobjections aa the draft convention on worktaenfs compensa-tion for accidents and the delegates should endeavour toget them brought if posaibie into oomplete oonformity withour existing law and practice.,     They should in any oasonot support tho adoption by the Conference of thesorecommendations If in their final form they involve anysubstantial departure from our normal praotice.2&quot;      SECOND RgADIMg AND F3NAL 701*3 ON DRAFT 00M7BH7IOW3AND HgC0IvlLO!NMTT0N PROVISIONALLY ADORED&apos; BY gffl 1924OTjg--- -----The toxts of the draft conventions and reooramendation provisionally adopted by the 1924 Oonforenoe will be found in Command 2292(24).     A copy of the amendments proposed by the British Government to these drafts and of the letter forwarding them to the International Labour Office will bo found in Appendix IV attached.In general the delegates should do their best to get these amendments adopted by tho Conference and endeavour to enlist the support of the representatives of Governments who appear to &quot;be generally favourable to the principles underlying these amendments.     They should adjust their attitude towards amendments proposed by other Governments according to the extant to which such amendments are in agreement with the views of the british Government as shewn by the amendments whioh it has submitted.
r$ n rid i 0The delegates will, however, need some special instructions with regard to the proposed draft convention on night work in bakerios.     As the gabinet will be aware (see O.Pe543(24) and 0.P.3(25)) the Hoyal Commission on pood, prices wore asked to investigate and make a special report on the question whether the compulsory discontinuance of night baking would be likely to result - either permanently or temporarily - in an increase in the price of bread to the consumer, and if so what would be the amount of the increase.     I understand that the Night-Baking Sub-Commi ttee of the 3oyal Commission have now submitted a report in which they express the opinion that &quot;if new bread is to be supplied in the same condition of newness, to the same points and in the same quantities and at the same times in the morning as it is no?/, the cost of the loaf will be Increased and it is impossible to say that this increase will be purely temporary.*     The Committee are of opinion that on the average, In the event of a general abolition of night baking, the increased oost should not exceed a halfpenny on a quartern loaf.     The Committee state, however, that the roimposition of the Bread order or some form of legislative enactment which would prevent the sale of newly baked bread before a oertain hour in tho morning would obviato the necessity for any increase in oost0Assuming that any restriction on the sale of newly-baked bread is regarded as out of tho question and that tho Government would not at the present time entertain any change which might increase the price of the loaf, it is suggested that tho delegates should announce on seme suitable occasion in the ooursa of the Conference that,
in the light of the report of the Hoyal comsoi.esloo on Food prloas, the aovernment regreta being unable to ratify at pregont the draft oonvention prohibiting night work in bakeries. They should, add that the Government does not exclude the possibility of ratification in tfaa future if circumstances change, but it cannot commit itself In any way.If this ooursa is adopted It will be very difficult for the delayutes to move the amendments of a drastic character tfhioh havs been sent in by tht? British Govermont but whether they should do so or not might be  /t to their discretion.Ho questions arise under the remainder of the agenda about which it is nooeasary to trouble the Cabinet.f&amp;tld.)

(3)      in oase of temporary total incapacity? a dally or weekly payment equivalent to two-thirds of the workmanfs basic earnings as calculated for purposes of compensation;(4)      in oase of temporary partial incapacity, a proportion of the dai Ly or weekly payment payable In the oase cf temporary total incapacity calculated in reference to the reduction of earning power caused by the injury.Where compensation is paid in a lump sum?  the sum should not be less than the capitalised value of the pension which would be payable under the foregoing paragraphs.II.Where the injury is such that the workman requires the help of another person,- additional compensation should be paid to the workman which should hot be less than half the amount payable in the case of permanent total inoapacity.III.Where death results from the injury, those entitled to be regarded as dependants for purposes of compensation should include at least the following(l)    deceased&apos;s husband or wife;(s)   deceased*s children under IB years of age, or above that age if by reason of physical or mental infirmity    they are inoapable of earning;(3)    deceased!s ascendants (parents or grand-parents),  provided that they are without means of subsistence and were dependent on the deceased or the deceased was under an obligation to contribute towards their maintenance;(4)      deceased&apos;s grandchildren and brothers and sisters;(a) if below lg years of age,  or above that age if by reason of physical or mental infirmity they are incapable of earning,  and(b) if they are orphans,  or if their parents, though still living,  are incapable of pro-viding for them.&quot;[here compensation is paid as an annual pension, the maximum total of the pensions payable to all the dependants should not be less than&quot; two-thirds of the deceased*s annual earnings./Where
Where compensation ie paid in a lump sum, the maximum sum payable to all the dependants should not be less than the capitalised value of a pension equivalent to two-thirds of the deceased^ annual earnings.PROPOSED RECOMMENDATION AS TO JURISDICTION IN DISPUTES ON WORKMEN&apos;s COMPENSATION.Whereas disputes on workmen&apos;s compensation turn not only on the interpretation of laws or regulations but generally on questions of an occupational character requiring a thorough knowledge of working conditions, e.g,, questions as to the nature of the undertaking, the kind of risk inherent In it, the relation between the workman&apos;s employment and the accident, the method of oomputing earnings, the degree of incapacity for work/ the possibility of the workman&apos;s adapting himself to some other occupation etc;    andWhereas workmen and employers alone have the necessary knowledge and experience on these questions, and disputes on compensation matters might be more equitably settled if they were associated with the courts which have to decide such disputesj    andYifhereas it is possible in each country to secure the association cf employers and workmen with such courts without departing radically from the existing judicial system?The General Oonferenoe makes the following recommendations to each Member of the International labour organisations T1 *That every dispute relating to workmen*s compensation should preferably be dealt with by a speoial court or board of arbitration,  including in addition to regular Judges, an equal number of employers&apos; and workmen&apos;s representatives appointed to act as adjudicators by their respective organisations or on the nomination of such organisations.II.That, where disputes relating to workmen&apos;s compensation are dealt with by the ordinary courts of law, euoh courts shall be required to take the evidence of employersi and workmen&apos;s representatives as expert witnesses In any ease where the dispute involves a question of an occupational character, and in particular the question of the degree of incapacity for work.
9 Q s\ .J C 4APPENDIX IV,Amendments to the draft, conventions provisionally adopted by the Sixth Session of the International Labour Conference., July, 1924.. : i!    I.L.151/24. ; &apos; COPY.- &apos;, &apos;.       12th January, 1925. ,Sir/&apos; .   &quot;In response to your printed letters of the 15th March and the 15th November of last year, I am directed by the Minister of Labour to transmit to you herewith a schedule &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;   containing the amendments which H.M.Government consider it necessary to propose to the Conventions provisionally . adopted at the sixth Session of the Conference and which are to form the subject of further deliberation at the Session of 1925 and I am to acquaint you as follows with the considerations which have prompted H.M.Government thereto.With regard to the convention concerning equality of treatment in Workmen&apos;:? Compensation, it will be observed that the amendment proposed Is merely a drafting amendment, the adoption of which will it is considered bring the English text into closer correspondence with the French text.With regard te the Convention concerning the weekly . suspension of work for twenty-four hours in glass manufactur-ing processes where tank furnaces are used, I am to state that H.M.Government are: in complete sympathy with the object of this Convention, namely,.to secure an adequate weekly rest to the workers employed in the processes in question, but that in their opinion the;Convention, contains proposals whioh aro open in principle to grave objection and that in its present form the/-Convention will not attain the object In view.   &apos;:,-&quot;,:.-:-..,-In the first place I am to observe that the proposal ; In Articles 1 and 2 to require the, suspension of work on., Sunday, with consequent stoppage of the .machinery, is not necessary for the particular object In view, which should be a rest for theindividual worker and not a rest ;for the machine, and that it would therefore, if effectively&apos; en-., forced, involving, unnecessary interference with production. In this connection I am to refer to the reply which H.M. Government returned to. the questionnaire on this subject in which it was pointed out that the object in view could be fully seoured by providing that every worker in the f processes in question should, subject to such exceptions as may be authorised by the convention, be allowed a weekly   , rest of.at least, twenty-four hours and that this rest should be-given:wherever possible on Sunday.   I am to add-that In the opinion, of H.M,.Government provisions on these lines would be much more in harmony with the general objects of the International Labour Organisation;as laId down in the Treaty of Versailles.(as well, as with the principles ,,. generally observed In British legislation) than the present proposals.The Director, /in international Labour Office,GENEVA,
In the seaond place, H,M,Government, desire to call attention to the proposal in Article 3 that each State shall he given an absolute discretion to exempt ,:any work which must necessarily he carried on continuously for technical or economic reasons&quot; ,       I am to observe Vmt , IBe &quot;field&quot;of*&apos;&quot;exemption afforded by these words is wide in the extreme and it appears to H,M. Government that thay might be so used as to nullify the main purpose of the Convention.   No doubt if the prohibition In Article 1 is. retained in its present form, it can only be rendered tolerable by giving each State an extensive power of dispensing with its requirements but in the case of an industry like glass&apos;, which is the subject of -keen international competition, it is considered that any wide and ill*defined power of exemption la open to the gravest objection.   It is felt that the practical effect would be that whenever one Stats exempted any particular process, every other competing State would feel entitled and bound to allow a similar exemption and that thus any value the Convention might have from the workers&apos; point of view would be gradually destroyed.Thirdly, H.M.Government would call attention to the provision in Article 6 that workers employed on the ordinary rest day are to be given a weekly rest &quot;in conformity with the provisions of the Convention of 1921 concerning the weekly rest In industrial undertakings&quot;.     It would appear that the effect of the  reference to the Convention of 1921 would be:to allow each State ?to exclude any process which it saw fit from the application of this Article and so place it within the power of any ratifying State to make the operation of this Article a dead letter.In order therefore to make the Convention a more effective instrument for securing a weekly rest to the workers, and with a view to avoid the objections to which the Convention as at present drafted is open, H.M.Government propose that the  : amendments set out on the accompanying schedule should be made in the draft-convention, and I am directed to state that it would only be possible for them&apos;to accept the convention if amended on these lines.:   -With regard to the proposed draft convention on:night work in bakeries, I am to state that as this Convention stands at present it is not in a form In which; it could be accepted by H.M.Government and that before they could accept it amendments on the following lines would be necessary,   -First, it is the opinion of H.M.Government that the Convention should be limited to bakeries where bread or flour confectionery is baked for sale to the general public and that It should not apply to hotels, restaurants, schools, hospitals and other institutions where bread or flour confectionery is baked for exclusiverconsumption in the hotel, restaurant or Institution.   The latter class of premises appear to H,M. Government to stand on quite; a different, footing from the former class.   In Great Britain they are not classed with,/and
and as regards conditions of work often differ widely from, factory undertakings, nor are they subject to : inspection by the factory inspector.     They should therefo: In the opinion of H.M.Government be brought within the exception already contained in the convention for baking done by members of the same family for home consumption.Secondly, H.M^Government: c ons ider that the Convention ought not to make it obligatory to apply the-prohibition against night baking to the master baker. Apart from .the fact that such application would be inconsistent with the general principle on which factory legislation in-Great Britain Is based., It- is considered that it would be equally inconsistent with the purpose of Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles, which aims only at the protection of the employed worker.   H.M,Government take the view that such Interference with the personal liberty of the employer can only be justified if and where it nas been proved to be essential in the Interests of the persons employed and that the necessity for such Interference is not a question which can be determined by reference to the experience of any particular State or States but must depend in each State on the special : conditions obtaining therein.   In this connection I am to refer to an article dealing with legislation on this subject recently proposed by the French Government which appeared In the issue of.&quot;Industrial and Labour Information&quot; on Monday, 15th December, 1924.     It is there stated that &quot;one modification which is of the first importance and also in agreement with one of the fundamental but most discussed paragraphs of the draft convention will be found In the Bill:    this is the extention of the prohibition of night work to master bakers&quot;.    I am to point out that the expressed view of the British Government is, and has always been, that this extension of the prohibition Is not a fundamental provision of the proposed convention but, on the contrary, is one which can and should be omitted from it, and I am to state that H.M.Government view with regret the unqualified use of tho word &quot;fundamental&quot; in the paragraph quoted,Thirdly, the proposal to fix the night period at not less than seven consecutive hours, to include the interval between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., or when it is required by climate or season the interval between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. appears to H.M.Government to be unnecessarily restrictive. It should be clearly realised that the whole purpose of the definition of night in the convention is to prevent the employment of a night shift on baking, and for that purpose to fix the latest hour for stopping and the earliest hour for beginning work.   The duration of the individual worker&apos;s nightly rest is not in any way dependent on the limits so fixed.     Viewed in this light,At
It appears to H.M,Government that it should be quite sufficient for the purposes of the Convention to provide that the term &quot;night&quot; must Include either the period between 11 p,m, and 5 a,m. or the period between 10 p.nr. and 4 a,m. and, subject to this provision, to leave it to the competent authority in each country to fix the period-during which night baking is to be prohibited.     It may be observed that if this recommendation were adopted it would enable two. day shifts of nine hours each to be worked.Should the Convention be amended on the lines above Indicated, H,M,Government are disposed to accept It provided they can be satisfied, that the effect of its adoption would not be to cause an Increase- in the price of bread to the consumer.     In view of the high cost of living and recent rise in the prices of food, a Royal Commission has recently been appointed tP investigate the present prices of food and H.I.I. Government have invited the Royal Commission to report on the question as to whether, and If so to what&apos;extent, prohibition of night baking would be likely to result in an increase In the price of bread. &apos;    Pending the report of this Commission they are unable to come to a final decision.   Meanwhile, they desire, in oonformity with the views set out above, to give notice of the amendments which will be found in the accompanying  ... schedule, &apos;     --      I am, Sir,;&apos;-       -&apos;&apos;  &apos;        &apos; Your; obedient Servant,T.
