0 A B I N E TIFJJERNATIOHAL LABOUR POLICY,A,/ rMomors^duro by the Chancellor .of the Duchy of LancastertIt would be very unfortunate if the Cabinet felt corapelled to adopt an attitude of hostility towards the International Labour Organisation-      That institution may have defects but its objects, as was pointed out the other day by the Chancellor of tho Sxchsquer, are in themselves excellent and such as all Conservatives should welcome0       For it exists to level up industrial conditions throughout the world, and since the conditions prevailing in this country are very much better than the average.; that process must be of advantage to this country as well as a good thing in itselfoWith many of the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee I am in full agreement.    It is, for instance9 clearly right that we should be satisfied before putting in force any Industrial Convention involving a change in our law and practice, that our competitors are really -prepared to do the same.    But when it is said that it is desirable to restrict the activities of the International Labour Org nisation within the limits originally contemplated I have more doubts,    The objects of the International Labour Organisation are very fully set out in the Treaty, and it seems questionable whether it is desirable to lay down a restricted Mandate for the British Representatives.    Ilor does the lvl ndate suggested at page 7
of the Committee1s report seem any clearer or more definite than that contained in the Treaty.    &apos;.7e are not   given any specific instances of attempts by the International Labour Organisation to exceed its jurisdiction.As to the other statements made in the report it is only right to point out that &quot;when it is said that more than half the Members have no ratifications to their credit the groat majority of those Members are South American Republicse    Three are British Dominions - I am told that Germany and Prance have each ratified the White Phosphorus Convention, and that Bills covering nine othor Conventions have been submitted to the Chamber, two of which have already passed the Senatoc    Further, it Is, I believe, rash to assume that labour conventions ratified by foreign countries are habitually evaded.    Labour parties are .;trong enough in most of the chief countries to prevent this happening as much as Is sometimes thought 0     Finally I am not quite clear., as to what is meant by the recommendations that the information side of the Office should he strengthened against the side of the Office responsible for dealing With propaganda,, -    V/hat is the latter? and what does it do?At the same time it must be admitted that with regard to both its powers and its finance the present position of the International Labour Organisation is not altogether satisfactory.      Under the Treaty of Versailles the International Labour Organisation was established as an entirely independent body though connected with the League in various ways chiefly by the provision that it was to be financed by the League,, The result is anomalous.    The Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation prepares its own Budget., and demands from the League payment of the amount to balance it,
True the demand has to pass through the elaborate controlling machinery of the League - the Supervisory Commission, the Budget Committee, and the Assembly.      But that  is not quite the same thing as giving to the body which has to find the money a direct responsibility for the demands made and supported by the Director of the Labour Organisation with his character-is tic eloquence and force.     Again the powers of the Labour1 Organisation seem open to criticism.      There is a good deal to be said for the existence of advisory expert bodies to assist the League,  such as the Finance and Economic Committees, and even that much misunderstood body the defunct Temporary Mixed. Commission for the Reduction of Armament s e    But the usefulness of such bodies depends upon their being genuinely advisory and completely subject to the Council and Assembly which represent directly the Governments of the Members of the League.      The Labour Organisation is not purely advisory.,      It has very definite executive or quasi-executive functions.      Its Conference draws up Conventions which if adopted by s two-thirds majority have to be submitted to the Parliament or other Constitutionalauthorities of the various States and in certain cases the....Governing Body&apos;is entrusted with the setting up of international enquiries involving penal consequences.      These are duties which as it seems to me should only be exercised by a Governmental body with undivided constitutional responsibility,     Nor does the actual composition of the Governing body improve matters in this respect.      The plan of having a composite body partly official and partly unofficial is in itself likely to put the official members in a false position.     And when the unofficial members are themselves divided into two sections representing divergent points of view it is not- 3 &amp;
int)orh&amp;t39 surprising to find suoh an unsparing condemnation of the temper and attitude of tile Governing body as that contained in the third paragraph of the Memorandum of the ministry of Labour. xIt is in truth almost inevitable that a body so constituted should be suspected of making partisan decisions and that its official members should feel themselves sometimes forced to chose between efficiency and political popularity0If the foregoing observations are well founded it will not do much good to try and limit the activities or expenditure of the existing organisation.      Efforts in that direction are not likely to be successful, and if they were it is vary questionable whether they would produce dmoirable results.    There is a great field of very useful activity open to the International Labour Organisation and for the British Government to take up an attitude of continued suspicion towards it will probably injure our influence without increasing the efficiency of the Labour Office,I venture therefore to suggest as an alternative policy, that, while continuing to take all precautions to soo that our foreign competitors do not use the International Labour Organisation machinery in order to get an unfair advantage over us, wo should rather aim at placing the organisa-tion itself on a sounder basis than at effecting small economies which could not at the outside produce a saving to us of more than a few hundreds a year, and that at the cost of considerable international friction and loss of influence.    I suggest that ko International Labour Organisation should become a department
of the League itself, preserving a large degree of autonomy its detailed working and organisation but subject in the last resort to the control of the Council.      No doubt the means of effecting such a reform would have to be studied.      It would probably be quite impossible to carry it out until the end of the term of office of the present very able and devoted Director - Monsieur Albert Thomas. But preliminary steps In that direction might be taken as opportunity serves 0R . C .April S3rd3  1925.
