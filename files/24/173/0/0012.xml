...................&apos;-te^free*y\j^PQCUMENTJjg THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTSf OF LABOUR.    -FACTORIES BILL. Clauses as to Hours and Overtime.1.        The proposal in the Bill is to limit the total hours worked by women and young persons to 48 per week exclusive of a limited amount of overtime.   Although I recognise that there are dlfficultiea in the way of re-enacting the existing limits, yet I feel very doubtful whether It Is prudent at the present time to fix a statutory limit of 48 hours for women.   I have now in mind not so much the question of the Washington Hours Convention, for that I think can be dealt with on the lines discussed, as the indirect effect upon certain Important industries, especially export industries, of fixing a statutory limit of 48 hours for women,    I am not sure whether my colleagues appreciate the extent to which the conditions fixed for women govern the hours worked by men.   In the textile trades, out of approxi-mately 1,300,000 employees, nearly 800,000 are women, and no prolongation of normal working hours beyond 48 would be possible, If that was the limit fixed for women. Similarly, in the boot and shoe trade over a third of the 140,000 workpeople are women.   In general and electrical engineering and the metal trade  (excluding Shipbuilding, marine engineering and construction c-f vehicles), over 12 per cent of the employees are women and in some of the trades in which foreign competition, particularly German competition, may be serious, such as electric cable and lamp manufacture the proportion exceeds a third.
24      It is notorious that in certain of our export trades much longer hours are being worked by foreign competitors than are being worked to-day in this country. No one desires to see the 48-hour week which generally prevails exceeded, If it is possible to maintain it, but is it safe to assume that there is no risk of any important industry reaching a position where it is forced to extend its working hours in order to meet foreign competition?3.     There can be no question that by fixing a limit of 48 hours for women we are tying the hands of employers in many Important industries in negotiations with trade unions as to overtime and wages.      There are many signs that in the near future the bone of contention in industrial relations will be hours rather than wages. Employers might find it necessary to ask for an extension of hours as a means of getting greater freedom on questions of overtime, which may become vital in the face of foreign competition,4,      It should not be forgotten that although possibly 75 per cent of industry is at present working hours which do not exceed 48, at least 20 per cent even now find it necessary to work more,5,      It is very repugnant to me to take up any attitude that may seem obscurantist or obstructive to social progress.      If we could be sure of 11 tuning up&quot; conditions abroad to the British pitch, it would be a different matter.     But we have to face facts as they are.    The
long trade depression and unemployment In this country0are largely caused by high comparative costs which in turn are due to the higher British standard of industrial ocnditions.In my view therefore this Is not the tine to Impose further rigid limits upon British industry.(Intd)   A. 3-li,kinigtry,of Labour. 5?3rd April, 1926.
