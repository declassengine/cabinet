his document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.A1Sii! CRET.CP.  202(25).CABINET.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE,LEAD PAINT   (PROTECTION AGAINST P01SPUING) BILL,Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The Labour Government introduced last year a Bill for the regulation of the use of lead paint in the building industry with a view to giving effect to a Draft Convention which had been adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 1921. The main objects of the Bill were   (1) the prohibition of the use of lead paint for interior work after a period of grace expiring in November 1927;     (2) precautions for the protection of the health of workers employed in the use of lead paint on exterior work.    When the Bill came on for Second Reading in the House of Commons there was general approval of the proposal to make regulations requiring certain precautions,  but there was strong opposition to the proposed prohibition of lead paint for interior work both among the Liberal and Conservative Parties, and the Second Reading was only obtained on Mr. Henderson giving a promise that if the prohibition clause was defeated, he would still proceed with the Bill.    The dissolution prevented further progress being made.The question of giving effect to the Convention was under consideration by the Home Affairs Committee at the end of 1923, shortly before the Conservative Government went out of Office, and it was agreed then (see Note of Conclusions of Home Affairs Committee on 8th November,   1923)  as follows  ;-&quot;That it should be announced that the British Government did not propose to take any final decision on the question of ratification at present,  but that an undertaking should be given that if the British Government were not completely satisfied that the new process  (i.e.  the process of wet
2-rubbing down), had been adopted and was being properly carried out by the trade interests concerned they would take steps to secure that full effect was given to the Convention on the appointed day in 1927.    The understanding (not for publication) being that consideration of the question of ratification would be taken up on the expiration of twelve months from the date on which the Home Office Regulations become operative.&quot;The general position as regards prohibition of use of lead paint for interior work remains very much as it was.    On the other hand,  it is very important that regulations should be made for the protection of workers employed on painting with lead paint. The- danger of lead poisoning is serious, and all parties are agreed that regulations should be made.    In fact a draft set of regulations was agreed some two years ago between the Home Office and the industry.    I understand there is a strong desire on the part of the White Lead Manufacturers, as well as the Master Painters, that the necessary legislation to give power for putting these regulations into force should be passed as soon as possible.I accordingly submit to my colleagues the draft of a Bill for this purpose.The first clause,  which gives effect to a provision in the international Labour Convention,  is, I understand from Mr. Harney, M.P.,  accepted by the White Lead Manufacturers.    It is, of course, also accepted as part of the Geneva Convention by the Master Painters.Clause 2 provides for the making of Regulations.Clause 3 extends to building operations the requirement of the notification of cases of lead poisoning and the like,  and applies the necessary machinery clauses of the Factory Act.Clauses 4 and 5 are also machinery clauses.I shall be glad to have authority to introduce the Bill at once.W.  J. H.th April,   1925.E81-2.
