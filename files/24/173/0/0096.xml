In March, 1923, 1 submitted at the instance &apos;0f the Treasury a proposal to the -   ^cabinet (CP. 2.715) to award clasps (65 in all) for -certain battles and operations in all   a?^fa theatres of war and in addition year -clasps for all who crossed -certain lines in any year in      &quot;&apos; * which they did not qualify for a battle clasp.   The estimated cost of this proposal was  1,750,000 for manufacture alone without allowing for administrative expenses.   thi3 proposal had not been considered when tbe -Government went out of office.2. Since that,date the Army Council have had this question under their  o.nsideratio 11 from time to time, but, in view of the financial stringency and the considerable ex^ppp^ture involved, they have made no further representations. They have appreciated that there is a widespread desire amongst those who served in the War that jEJiis project should ,not be abandoned and, as they understood that the late Chancellor of the Exchequer was willing to consider proposals to award clasps which could be shown to involve an expenditure not exceeding  100,000, they iaye reviewed the question once.again. As a result of this further review I now put forward a scheme, the .main lines ,of which are : (i) The main principles laid down iby :a Committee in 1919 and approved by the then Secretary of State for War should be observed, and that the nomenclature adopted for Regimental Battle Honours should be tfie basis of any scheme for the award.of clasps.; (ii) T-he number of clasps which any one individual could be awarded should be restricted to 10, -but the whole .of the 153 &quot;Battles&quot; included as Battle Honours for cavalry and infantry should be available for fighting personnel to select therefrom the clasps for which they had qualified.(iiii) Every man wrho fought on the battle front shall be eligible to earn at least one clasp even though he may not have been present in any one of the battles to which a clasp is allotted. To enable this to be done, a theatre &quot; clasp: is included in the complete list.(iv) Certain members of Corps, Army and General Headquarters should be eligible to select their clasps from a reduced list of battles in respect of their service at those Headquarters ; other personnel of those Headquarters should be eligible to earn clasps on the basis of individual risk, that is to say, if they entered on duty the prescribed zones.(v) Lists of units of all arms which took part in the several battles should be compiledon the basis of the Battle Honours awarded to cavalry and infantry. Lists should be made available to claimants as a guide to them in preparing their claims.(vi) The clasps should be of silver.   Nickel clasps are regarded as unsuitable, as themedals on which they are to be mounted are of silver.3. No further verification of claims beyond that of the information in the possession of the Medal Branch of the War Office is to be attempted except in the case of deceased soldiers. Clasps.will only be issued on application, and it is estimated that practically a year must elapse from the date of approval until issue of clasps begins.4. The effect of this scheme will be to raise the average number of clasps which men will be able to earn to eight, making an aggregate of 32,000,000 clasps for the 4,000,000 men eligible, exclusive of Indian troops, for whom 2,000,000 more must be added at(B25/17)   75   6/25   W.O.P.   1850
Imperial expense. The total cost of an issue of 34,000,000 clasps on these conditions is estimated at from  517,000 to  573,000. This sum would be spread over a number of years. Silver to the value of sB45,000 to  50,000 from unclaimed medals is available for this service. The Council realise that this figure is greatly in excess of the  100 000 contemplated by the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, but they are convinced that if clasps are to be issued no satisfactory solution of the problem can be achieved at a cost less than that now estimated, which compares favourably with any previous proposal.5. The only practical alternative to this scheme is that clasps should be authorized for purchase from the War Office by individuals at their own expense. This would reduce the total cost by some  350,000. The administrative expenses of checking claims and distribution would remain, and are estimated at a maximum of  190,000. By the imposition, however, of a small additional charge for each clasp, the cost of administrative expenses might be met, at least in part.6. A modification of the latter scheme would allow the wearing of clasps on miniature medals, the clasps being purchased at the individual^ own expense and from private firms. It is understood that this is the practice in the Royal Navy. The principles and conditions outlined in paragraph 2 would be adopted to determine the clasps to which an individual is entitled, and there would still be inevitable administrative expenses in checking the claims.   These expenses are estimated at something under  100,000.7. In conclusion, the Council desire to draw attention to the fact that clasps have been authorised for the General Service Medals awarded for minor campaigns since the armistice, the risks and hardships of which hardly bear comparison with those of the Great War.8. The Council recommend, therefore, that (i) Clasps should be issued at public expense on the lines indicated in paragraph 2 ;(ii) If (i) be not approved, clasps should be authorised for purchase at the individual&apos;sown expense (paragraph 5) ; or(iii) If no issue be authorised either at the public expense or on payment, a list of operations and battles considered worthy of commemoration by clasps should be published, and individuals should be allowed to purchase at their own expense and wear attached to miniature medals the clasps to which they would be entitled under the scheme outlined in paragraph 2, at a cost of something under  100,000 to the public (paragraph 6).9. The Council have put their recommendations in order of priority. While some Members of Council are in favour of (ii) if (i) be impracticable, as they think that all ranks serving would be willing and anxious to buy their clasps, others are opposed to the proposal on the ground that they consider that ex-service opinion would be against the imposition of an)7 charge.L.

Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1925SECRET.CP. 295 (25).CABINET.SPECIAL  RE POET   ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 117.      May 1925.DURING the four weeks ended the 25th May the total unemployment figures remained practically stationary, the net result of the slight fluctuations each week being a decrease of only 546. Analysis of the figures shows that, while reductions occurred in the numbers both of unemployed women, due to better employment in the clothing trades and to other seasonal causes, and also of juvenile workers, as the result of their absorption into industry after the increased registrations at the end of the recent school term, the registers of men unemployed have, with the exception of one week, gradually increased during the period.Further deterioration of the position in the coal-mining industry, together with increased unemployment in the textile trades, particularly woollens and worsteds, was only off-set to a slight extent by improvements in engineering (except marine and heavy engineering), in iron and steel, and in the Welsh tin-plate trade. The other industries showed, on the whole, little change.It will be noted that this Report deals with the position during M&quot;ay, before the sudden advance in the numbers out of work during the early part of the current month had set in.A.
