In 1923, however, Mr. Alexander Grant, now Sir Alexander Grant, Bart., made a munificent donation of  100,000 for the endowment of the proposed national Library for Scotland, with the result   ., that the Government were enabled to accept the offer on behalf of the nation.The purpose of the Bill is to effect tho transfer of the Library from tho Faculty to the nation:    to provide for the establishment of the National Library and the constitution of a Board of Trustees:    to. define the powers and duties of the Board:    and to transfer to the Board certain funds and the privilege under the Copyright Act.
