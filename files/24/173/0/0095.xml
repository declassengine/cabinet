CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.&apos; Document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.O A B I H B 3? (25) &quot;*WIDOWS, OHBBLuNS AND OLD AGB CQulTRIBUQ? QHY -jPSNSIOHS BII&amp;. t^memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty,The Secretary of State for War proposes that in addition to the 4^-d a week &quot;employed contribution&apos;1, to be paid by Sailors, Soldiers -and Airmen for the benefits provided under the Widows, Orphans and Old Age Contributory Pensions Bill, a farther charge of 2-g-d shall now be made against their pay in respect of Health and Unemployment.So far as men already in the Navy are concerned, the decision that no charge should be made again at their pay in respect of National Health Insurance was one of the Government decisions on the Jerram Coismittee proposals of 1919.     3?hese decisions were publicly announced in the name of the Government, and the men now in the Navy regard them as in the same category as M&amp;gna Chart a.     It would be impossible, in my opinion, to annul one of these decisions without giving rise to a strong, and I think: well-founded, impression that a breach of public faith had occurred.So far as Unemployment Insurance is concerned, the present position is that our men are not insured during service;   employment in the Naval, Military or Air Services of the Grown being exempted employment.Under Section 41 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 19 0., fas amended) men are, however, allowed on discharge, except in certain circumstances (such as desertion, discharge at own request, or after conviction for a specific offence etc.) a credit of contributions (originally 90;   now increased to 156) whion qualifies forthe......
the existing rate of unemployment benefit in 0-matter Britain and northern Ireland subject to the statutory conditions.Payment in respect of the contributions is aade to the Ministry of Labour by the Service Departments on men leaving the Service, and under Clause 41 of the Act quoted no payment is exacted from the men.     5?he rato of the capitation fee paid &quot;by the Service Departments io calculated, by the Government Actuary mid approved by the Treasurer,     j,t present it is  12 for each man or boy of the ago of 16 and upwards eligible for the credit of contributions on discharge he whole existing position would obviously have to be altered if a charge is now to be made against the men for the period during which they are not insured.     Uhere is no ground that I can see on which such a change could be made, and it would be obvious to all concerned that this is mereiy an indirect way of reducing the pay of those now in the Service.     therefore I consider it would be more than unwise to take such a step.As regards new ontries after the date of the Act,the Government1s hands are of course free.     If, however,new entries are to be eharged this additional 2-^-d theposition will be that men and boys in reoeipt of a lower rate of pay would suffer an abatement of 7d a v/eofe althoughonly 4% a week would be deducted from those in receipt of higher scales of pay.     Such a state of affairs would giverise to infinite trouble and create a standing sense of grievance whioh no amount of explanation would alleviate.Also the fact that this net? charge will be made on tho manTsjgay must inevitably be taken into aocount in fixing the new rates of pay now under consideration.     Is it not far better thatthen/the fact that the men make no contribution in respect of Health and Unemployment should be borne in mind in
fixing these new rates, rather than that we should attempt, at this juncture, to use the new Insurance Bill as can opportunity for going bade on previous Government decisions, thus presenting the new recruits in all three Services with an additional grievance apart from their lower rates of pay ?(Intld)    W. 0.
