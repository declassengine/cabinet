Memorandum by, ther.Minister of Apricu3.^ure and Fisheries..During the debate In the House of Commons on the Agricultural Returns Bill on April 8th I was pressed by Mr, Lloyd George, Mr. Hoel Buxton and others to undertake a survey of the agricultural conditions and possibilities of the country and I promised to consider the question with the object of securing as much relevant Information as to the productivity of agricultural land as it is possible on a reliable basis to obtain.It is clear from the debate that many of the speakers believed that such a survey would disclose the fact that much of the land of the country Is seriously underfarmed, that much more food could be produced and much more labour employed, and their request for a survey was coloured by the hope that It would produce ammunition for their policy of controlling the manner in which land is farmed.It is equally clear that the prospect of the appointment of a number of persons to inspect and report on farms all over the country has aroused considerable apprehension among farmers, and that any hasty decision to undertake a survey of the kind would get us into serious trouble with many of our beet friends and would provide our opponents with exactly the material they want for political propaganda.It is necessary, therefore, to proceed with caution, and after full consideration I have come to the conclusion that while we should do all we can to collect reliable information on matters of fact, we should steadfastly decline to undertake a survey which could only be based on opinion and the result of which would not be accepted as conclusive and would provoke much undesirable controversy.
This being so I propose that our inquiries should not attempt to deal with tbe question whether or not any lana is under farmed or baaiy farmed&quot;.   There will always be differences of opinion on that question among the most competent experts, and what may appear to be underfarming to the casual observer-may be due to the poor quality of the land, to the low level of prices, to lack of capital or to unfavourable seasons just as much as to lack of competence, skill or energy.     After three such bad seasons as we have had recently It is inevitable that much of the land is In an untidy and dirty condition, but this is not necessarily a reflection on those who are responsible for&quot;its cultivation-^ whether they are farmers or labourers.If,, therefore-&quot;, I am questioned in the ^ouse as to what I intend to do in regard to the suggested survey, I propose to reply on the lines of the annexed statement. If no questions are asked I should proceed on those lines without making any public announcement1.The cost of carrying out my proposals should not amount to more than  10,000, whereas a complete survey might cost  100,000 and would necessitate going to Parliament for compulsory powers of entry and inspection which would be hotly opposed&apos;,E.P.L^.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries; 9th June, 1925&apos;.
Suggested  Agricultural Survey.Proposed   Statement in House of Commons by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.MI have considered the suggestions meds by the Right Hon. Gentleman, the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs, in the course of dis-cussion on the Agricultural Returns Bill in this House and as I then stated I am anxious to place Parliament and the country in possession of all the relevant and reliable information that can be obtained concerning the agricultural situation.In the first plaoe I may say that, in connection with the Census of Production in industry generally, I am arranging to collect this year, in addition to the ordinary agricultural statistics, supplementary information necessary to ascertain accurately and completely the extant of the agricultural output of the country.The principal heads under whioh information will be obtained are as follows:-(a) The gross production of the crops and live stock produced.(b) The gross output of the products sold off the land.(o)      The net output in tarms of value, which would represent the balanoe available for rents, rates, taxes, wages and profits.Information will also be collected of the labour employed, and estimates made of the capital invested in these faming operations.This information will be collected in part from returns made by the ocouplers of the land and in part from the Ministry&apos;s staff of Crop   Reporters, over 300 in number, who are men intimately acquainted with the agricultural oiroumstanoes of their own districts.These particulars will afford us far more accurate and complete information than is at present available as to the actual agricultural     position as it obtains in different
S (:iparts of the country, and will provide a sound basis for comparisons not only between different districts and between thi3 country and other countries abroad, but also with other industries as regards output per unit of capital, per unit of labour and so forth.In addition, I propose to extend the scope of these Inquiries by obtaining through the Ministry43 Crop Reporters and other competent persons information as to the uses to which all the land of the country is put.There is an area of some 6 million acres not included in the existing agricultural returns, of which some 2 million acres is represented by woods and forests. The remainder includes the area of open spaces, recreation grounds and all holdings of less than one acre, but I will have enquiry made to see whether there is any potential agricultural land included in this area.The existing agricultural returns however Include in addition to ordinary farm land, all land which is used for grazing and thus include parks, commons, mountain and heath land.       It is proposed to classify this land in a way which has not hitherto been attempted so as to show the area which is at present used for purely agricultural purposes as parts of farms or small holdings and the area which though used to some extent for agricultural purposes can toe distinguished as not being farmed as a commercial undertaking.I propose also to undertake a special inquiry to ascertain the extent of land which is suffering from the lack of proper drainage, whioh as the House is aware is perhapo the principal impediment to food production in many parts of the country.
Finally, I may remind, the House that the Oxford Institute for Research in Agricultural Economies and the organisation of advisory costings offioera at the various Agricultural Colleges obtain in the normal course of their work certain data as to the capitalisa-tion, turnover and expenditure on labour, rent, etc., of a large number of farms in the country, from which an opinion can be formed as to the economic position of different types of farming.By these means we shall I hope obtain within the next year information aa to the use of all the potential agricultural land of the country, the condi-tions under which it is cultivated and the contribution it is making towards the national food supply.&quot;
