1 ^ 21THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. Copy No.   3*&apos;RATING AND VALUATION BILL.The following are the more Important provisions ofthe Bill.Part I (Rating). 1. Abolition of Parochial Rating;.    (Clause 1).The effect of the proposed transfer of the rating functions of Overseers to Borough and District Councils will be to reduce the number of rating authorities from 12,844 to 648 in rural areas, and from 2,550 to 1,148 in urban areas.     All paid parochial officers - most of them part-time officers with very small salaries - will be transferred to the new rating authorities, and either employed by them or discharged with compensation on the scale normally adopted in Local Acts and Public General Statutes.     A proportion of the more efficient will be ultimately retained as whole-time rating officers, but probably the process of reduction will be gradual.In each of the 1,148 urban areas there will be one rating authority - the Borough or District Council - instead of two.2. Consolidation of Rates. (Clauses 2, 3 and 21, with Second Schedule). Except in the towns (some 50) where consolidation of rates has been effected by Local Act, two or more rates of different incidence are now levied and in most cases separate rating staffs are employed.     Under the Bill one &quot;General Rate&quot; will be levied for all local purposes, but this does not involve any material alteration in the reliefs hitherto enjoyed in connection with General District Rates by railways and certain other classes of hereditament *The Bill provides for equated reliefs corresponding wltfc the average reliefs actually enjoyed in the years 1914 to 1924,09(25).
and those reliefs - as well as the relief enjoyed by Agricultural land end tithes will be given In   calculating operative rateable values from net annual values In the valuation lists, Instead of by allowance in the collection of the rates.In the rural areas a consolidation of Special Sanitary Rates and Lighting Rates is effected, and Library Rates are merged with the Poor Rate under the new &quot;General Rate&quot;.     Here also no appreciable change in the incidence of charge Is involved.The consequential unification of funds and accounts (Clause 9) should effect considerable simplification and economy.3.   The Precepting Reform. (Clause 8).It is proposed that all Precepting Authorities shall call for the produce of a rate of specified poundage from each constituent Rating Authority, Instead of for specified sums calculated by apportioning expenditure on the basis of assessable values.Expenditure common to an area, the burden of which is supposed to be equally distributed, gives rise, under the present system, to rating of different amounts in the pound In different parts of the areas, because the values upon which It is portioned out are by no means uniformly productive. Even where the constituent parishes are urban, the rating for common services has varied by over a shilling in the pound, and a small parish with half its assessable value temporarily unproductive may have to pay twice as much in the pound as Its neighbours in respect of services common to all.The large amount of work at present involved in adjustment of apportioned charges owing to delayed decisions on appeals which affect the valuations will be avoided.
Collection of Rates by Owners * (Clause 10).The Clause Is designed to secure to Rating Authorities the assistance of owners In the collection of rates on small properties in return for a 5 per cent, commission.     At present owners can be compulsorily rated, but their assistance can only be so secured at the cost of a 15 per cent, commission In the case of the Poor Rate and 25 per cent, or more in the case of other rates.Under the Bill there will be no compulsory transfer of rate liability from occupier to owner.     Owners will only be liable to pay over the amount of rates actually collected, less the commission.Voluntary &quot;compounding&quot; agreements to pay &quot;full or empty&quot; will still be possible, but the limit of further commission is put at 10 per cent.The Clause Is further intended to secure that fluctuations in the rates shall be a matter of real interest to tenants as Local Government electors, and to that end it provides, in effect, that owners collecting rates shall demand with their rents (and be entitled to recover) the actual amount of the rates due in respect of each property.Rating of Houses let out in parts. (Clause 11).The present procedure for rating houses let out in parts differs (Inter alia) according to whether the parish is or Is not partly within a Parliamentary Borough.     Clause 11 is intended to render the treatment uniform and remove doubts In regard to the procedure.Remedies vchere the Levy of Rates is improperly deferred. (clause the present law contains a number of provisions designed to prevent local authorities leaving it to their successors to levy part of the money they have spent,
9,g. provisions making it illegal to pay debts incurred, before defined dates, to honour orders for payment when funds have not been provided, or to pay interest upon oash over-drafts however they arise, or provisions onabling retro-spec tive rates to be quashed.    In no case does the penalty fall upon the persons who ought to have provided the money, and in each case the remedy is one calculated to embarrass those who have tho management of the local finances.The Bin substitutes for these provisions the deterrent of surcharge for wilful neglect to levy adequate rates.Minor Rating Reforms.(i)   Abolishing the formalities of applying to Justices to allow rates (Clause 4) or to sanction excusals on the ground of poverty (Clause 2). (ii)   Equitable provision for apportioning rate chargesbetween incoming and outgoing ratepayers (Clause 4). (iii)   Simplifying the correction of clerical errors inrate books or the amendment thereof to meet altered circumstances (Clause 5). (iv)   Providing more up to date methods of publication of notices (Clause 6). (v)1   Securing that adequate and reliable Information is given on the rate demand notes (Clause 7). (vi)    Providing a remedy in case of default in precept payment already applicable in London (Clause 13). (vii)   Separating appeals against valuations from appeals against ratoa (Clause 14).
Part II. (Valuation;. 15 6The Authorities.The primary work of drafting valuation lists is transferred &quot;by the Bill from the present parochial officers to the Councils of Boroughs and Urban and Rural Districts (Clause 23).The work of reviewing the draft lists and hearing*and determining objections, ia placed in the hands of newly-oonstituted Assessment Committees.   Those bodies are no longer to be oommitteas of the Poor Law Guardians, but are to be independent authorities representative of the Coxmty, District and Poor Law Authorities with two General Commissioners of Income Tax added In each case (Clause 16).The areas for which these Committees ere to act will bs rating areas or combinations of rating aroaa (Clause 15).Uniformity of - Valuation,(i) County Valuation Committees. (Clauso 17):-These Committees are to be appointed by the County Councils and are to comprise representatives of the County Council and of each Assessment Committee.   The powers conferred on them aro designed, together with the more representative Assessment Committees and the co-operation of Revenue Officers, to secure as much uniformity as is practicable in the principles and practice of assessment.(ii) Requiring Returns from Occupiers and Owners Clauses 46-48)The Bill extends to the whole country, and somewhat amplifies a power which has been consistently used in London for 55 years. Outside London the present law does not give to the rating authorities or assessment committees power to require even a return of the rent paid.(iii) Fixed Scales of Deduction (Clause 21 and second Schedule).At present each Assessment Committee (outside London) frames its own scales of deductions to be allowed in deducing nfft values from gross values, and
the scales vary widely, some being at least twice as high as others.   The Bill defines the scale for all ordinary hereditaments and gives statutory authority to what is, in fact, the practice of valuers in the case of public utility and other industrial properties, of directly estimating net values. 5*     One Valuation for all purposes.At present (outside London) all properties are separstoly valued for purposes of rating and taxation, and there is statutory provision for a separate basis for county-rates.     Under the Bill one valuation will 3erve for all rating purposes, and provision is made for the adoption of the gross values for purposes of income tax (Clause 19(4)).This, an*i the need for uniformity, involves co-operation between Hating Authorities and Revenue Officers in the preparation of the draft lists and giving to the latter such rights in connection with objections, appeals and revision of validation lists, etc. as are necessary to safeguard revenue interests (Clauses 23 to 34). 4.     Valuation Procedure.The Bill provides one cods of valuation law for the whole country, the line adopted being that of selecting from the provincial code of 1862 and the London code of 1869 provisions of proved value and removing as far as possible defects which experience has shewn to be common to both.Attention maY be called to the following provisions:-(i) Quinquennial revision of the lists (Clause 18). (ii) Interim araondrnent of values at any time, with consequential abolition of the formality of &quot;redeposit&quot; of lists and the complex machinery of &quot;provisional&quot; and &quot;supplemental&quot; lists (Clause 34).
Id 6(ill).     Revised provision for appeals from decisions of Assessment Committees (Clauses 29 to 33 and 5th, Schedule)*(a) Abolition of appeal to Special Sessions and substitution of appeal to Special Committees of Quarter Sessions with chairmen of legal experience.(b) Wider discretion to the Court in regard to costs.(c) Extended provisions for settling appeals by reference to an arbitrator or valuer.(iv).       Wider powers for the employment of valuers by rating authorities and assessment comnlttees and for appointment of a valuer by the Court (Clauses 43 and 44).5.    Railways and other Public Utility Undertakings (Clauses3B-4277The Bill provides for the valuation &quot;in cumulo&quot; of railways and other public utility undertakings - referred to as &quot;special properties&quot; - and for the apportionment of the aggregate values between the rating areas concerned.It sets up a Rail?;ay Assessment Authority (Clause 36), to be composed of seven representatives nominated by the representative Associations of Local Authorities under a judicial chairman.     The primary duty of this body will be the valuation of railways and of ancillary undertakings operated by the railway companies (Clauses 35-40);   but it is empowered to undertake the valuation of any public utility undertaking on the application of the Undertakers or the Council of any County or County Borough into which the works extend.     it is also to hear appeals against the assessment of special properties valued by a Local Assessment Committee or two or more of them acting jointly (Clauses 41 and 42),Hitherto railways have been valued in parochial sections on the estimated earnings of each section,     There kas been no revaluation of railways for 11 years and it is- 7 -
* -IRQparochial system to the revaluations which are so long overdue. Temporary &quot;carry over&quot; arrangements are at present in force.After conferences with representatives of the Railway Companies and of the several Associations of English and Scottish Local Authorities, proposals have been formulated for the valuation in cumulo of each of the grouped railway undertakings, including the Anglo-Scottish railways, in regard to which it is necessary to reconcile the differences between English and Scottish valuation law and practice. Those parts of the proposals which relate to England and Wales only are embodied in Clauses 38-40, and it is intended to introduce in this Session a Bill dealing with that part of the work of valuation which requires joint action by English and Scottish Authorities, viz;- the ascertainment of net receipts and allocation thereof between the two countries and containing other provisions affecting Scotland only.The Railway Assessment Authority in England and the Railway Assessor in Scotland will, on the basis of the share of net receipts allocated to each country, carry out the remaining stages of the valuation in cumulo and of apportion-raent.Clause 38 constitutes the first statutory recognition of valuation on the &quot;profits principle&quot; and embodies directions (agreed at the conferences above mentioned) designed to &quot;simplify the application of that principle*It has not been found practicable to secure agreement as to the division of the ascertained net receipts into the &quot;tenant&quot; s share&quot; and the &quot;landlord&apos;e share&quot; (or &quot;net annual value&quot;).     The question is necessarily, therefore, left for determination by the Railway Assessment Authority and judicial tribunals, on statistical evidence and arguments to be submitted to them, without reference to the past decisions of the Courts on the particular question of estimating the tenant&apos;s share.
Appeals against decisions of the Railway Assessment Authority are to lie to the Railway and Canal Commission, with appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal. 6,     Rating of Machinery.     (Clause 22 and 3rd Schedule).The Bill adopts with some modifications the majority report of the Departmental Committee, which aims at securing uniformity of practice and giving a measure of relief to machinery users.Machinery and plant, which at present are &quot;taken into account&quot; in assessing industrial properties to a varying extent by different Assessment Authorities, are divided by the Bill Into three classes -(a) Loose tools, machines worked by hand or foot, rolling . stock and contractor1e   movable   plant are exempted from rating.(b) Other plant and machinery, described in Part II of the Third Schedule and consisting of power-plant, lighting, heating, etc. plant, lifts, tracks and general industrial equipment, is to be treated as part of the hereditament and fully assessed.Plant and machinery not covered by (a) and (b) above is to be assessed at 50 per cent, of its value.     The provisions are not to apply to hereditaments valued by reference to accounts, receipts or profits.Effect is to be given to the relief by a deduction in the Valuation List (Second Schedule. Part II).I propose to circulate later alternative proposals with regard to the rating of machinery.(Intld.)    K.C.Ministry of Health. April 22nd, 1925.

(1) As from the date on which the first new provisions as valuation list made under Part II. of this Act for any rateg6n6ra     rating area, not being a rural district, comes into operation,the rating authority for that area, in lieu of the poor rate 10 and any other rate Which the authority has power to make, shall make and levy for their area a consolidated rate which shall be termed &quot; the general rate.&quot;(2) As from the appointed day the rating authority of - each rating area being a rural district shall, in lieu of 15making a poor rate for each parish, make and levy a general rate for the whole of the district.    .(3) Subject to the provisions of this Act, every general rate shall be a rate at a uniform amount per pound on the rateable value of each hereditament in 20 the rating area, and shall be made, levied and collected, and shall he recoverable, in the same manner in which, at the commencement of this Act, the pool/ rate may be assessed, made, levied, collected and recovered, and all the enactments relating to the poor rate in force at the com- 25 mencement of this Act, including (subject to the provisions of this Act) enactments relating to appeals against a poor rate, shall so far as not repealed by this Act. apply&quot;to the general rate:Provided that- , 30(a) In the case of any general rate made in a rural district. in respect of any period before the. date on which the first,new valuation list ,     .  :v. made under Part II. of this Act for the districtcomes into operation, the rating authority shall, 35 ; , &apos;, notwithstanding anything in this subsection,give effect in the collection of the rate to any exemption or abatement to which any person would have been entitled in respect of any hereditament whatsoever if the rate had been 40 a poor rate ; and

(T) The following matters shall be stated in the demand note on which the general rate is levied, that is 25 to say (a) the amount in the pound at which the rate is charged;the period in respect of which the rate is made;the proportions of the amount in the pound which 30 are being levied for the purposes respectively of the  rating authority and of each authority by which a precept has been issued to the rating authority;the part, if any, of the amount in the pound 35 which is being levied as an additional item of the rate;the part, if any, of the amount in the pound which is being levied to make good a deficiency in any trading account, or in any fund of which 40 a separate account is required to be kept;(b) Co)(d)(e)
