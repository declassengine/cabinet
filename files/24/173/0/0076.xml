SECRET. CP. 274 (25).CABINET.THE POSITION OF LOYALISTS IN THE IRISH FREE STATE.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for the Colonies.ON the 18th December last I received a deputation including, among others, Lord Lansdowne, Lord Oranmore and Browne, Lord Midleton, Lord Desart and Lord Bessborough, on the subject of Land Purchase in the Irish Free State. I was accompanied by Lord Salisbury and Lord Onslow.The object of the deputation, was, briefly, to request that the British Government should pay to the landoAvners in the Irish Free State, whose estates are still unpurchased under the Land Purchase Acts, the difference between the purchase price, which they will receive under the Irish Free State Land Act of 1923, and that which they would have received under the Report of the Irish Convention of 1918 and the Land Purchase Bill based on that Report, which was introduced into the British Parliament in 1920 but was never carried into law. This difference is estimated at from  5,000,000 to  6,000,000.My reply did not hold out any hope that the Government would be able to accede to this request; but I promised to lay the matter before my colleagues, and that we woulc* consider whether anything could be done to assist landowners in the Irish Free State.The deputation based their claim chiefly upon a pledge given by Lord Birkenhead in the House of Lords on the 13th July, 1921, in which he stated that land purchase in Ireland must be dealt with &quot; upon the lines which the Government have already indicated.&quot; This is assumed by the landowners to amount to a pledge that they should receive terms not less favourable than those embodied in the Report of the Convention and in the Act of 1920. This specific claim was considered by a meeting held on the 19th July, 1923, of the Irish Affairs Committee set up by the last Conservative Government, at which the Duke of Devonshire, Lord Salisbury, Sir W. Joynson-Hicks, Lord Eustace Percy, Mr. Bridgeman and Mr. Ormsby-Gore were present; and it was then decided &apos;&quot; 1. That the speech of Lord Birkenhead on the 13th July, 1921, could not be regarded as pledging the Government to pay to the landlords the difference (estimated at  5,000,000) between the price which they would have received under the Land Bill of 1920 and the price which they would receive under the Bill now before the Free State Parliament; nor to secure the passage of a Bill identical with the Bill of 1920, but onlv to secure the passage of an equitable Bill.&quot; 2. That in reply to Lord Mid3eton&apos;s motion on the 22nd July, the Duke of Devonshire should take the line that Lord Birkenhead&apos;s pledge was sufficiently fulfilled by the Land Bill now before the Free State Parliament.&quot;The grounds on which the Committee reached the conclusion that Lord Birkenhead&apos;s statement was not a pledge to secure for landowners terms identical with those in the Bill of J.920, may be summarised as follows : The statement was that the question of land purchase was to be settled &quot;upon the lines which the Government have already indicated,&quot; i.e., upon the lines of the Convention Report and the 1920 Bill. It was an essential part of the Report and of the Bill (a.) That they were part of a hoped-for general settlement, such as was embodied in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920;[13140] bPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1925.
(6.) That they were based upon an agreement between landlord and tenant; and(c.) That the cost of the bonus (is., of so much of the total cost of land purchase as was not recoverable from the tenant) was to be borne by the Irish and not by the British taxpayer.At the date of Lord Birkenhead&apos;s statement it was known that the settlement referred to at (a) had never come into being, but that a new settlement, on different lines, was likely to take its place; and it was also obvious that no such agreement was possible between landlord and tenant as that on which the 1920 Bill was based. When therefore a pledge was given to secure a settlement &quot;on the lines of&quot; the Convention Report, this could only refer to a settlement which followed the Convention scheme in so far as it was applicable to the existing situation in Ireland. As to point (c) above, it is clear that no pledge was at any time given to impose on the British taxpayer a burden which was not imposed on him by the Bill of 1920.I am not aware of any change which has taken place since July 1923 which should be held to affect the decision which was then &quot;reached by the&apos;Irish Affairs Committee, and I do not think therefore that we need consider the position of the Irish landowner otherwise than strictly on its merits.Under the Free State Act of 1923 the Irish landowner will receive in respect of his tenanted land such an amount of 4^ per cent. Land Stock guaranteed by the British Government as will provide him in perpetuity with a fixed secure and unembarrassed net income amounting to not less than 68 per cent, of his existing gross rental, out of which at present he has to pay tithes, head rents, agenfs salary, &amp;c, and a substantial proportion of which is never collected. In addition, the Act provides that the Land Commission shall collect and pay over to the landowner 75 per cent, of any arrears accrued during the three years prior to the passage of the Bill. It is true that the landowner regards it as a grievance that he is to receive only this amount of arrears; but I think it may fairly be said that if, as under previous Land Acts, he had been left to collect his own arrears, he would have got in very little, if anything, whereas, I understand that under the Act, out of a total of approximately  1,000,000, over  800,000 has already been collected and paid over, after the deduction of tithes, rates, income tax, and a commission of 5 per cent, to the agents.Taking into consideration all the circumstances and comparing the position of the landowners with that of other classes who have suffered by the change of Government in Ireland, I am bound to say that I do not think the landowners have been badly treated by the Free State Government. Undoubtedly they have suffered losses in recent years, and their future income will be less than it would have been had their land remained unpurchased and had their tenants paid their rent. I believe that their real grievance is not so much the terms which they have obtained under the Free State Act as the fact that those terms are substantially less favourable than those which they claim were promised and -which their more fortunate neigh-bours in the North will get under the Northern Ireland Land Bill. I cannot feel, however, that they have justified their claim that the British Government is bound, either by virtue of past pledges or on the merits, to make up this difference; and their claim appears to me to be equally inadmissible, whether it is for  6,000,000 in cash or for  6,000,000 in stock.It remains to be considered whether there is any concession substantially less than their full claim which we can and ought to grant; and this cannot, in my opinion, be considered without, at the same time, considering the position of the many others who have suffered owing to the change of Government in Ireland. Material for this consideration is supplied by the Report of the Irish Grants Committee, which I have received in January last (see Appendix), and by a conversation which I had on the 23rd January with the Duke of Northumberland, Colonel Gretton, and Major White (Secretary of the Southern Irish Loyalists Eeliel Association). .The Duke of Northumberland, who spoke with great moderation, dealt with a number of classes of hardship which have been brought to the notice of his Assocnv tion. Some of these were comparatively unimportant; others, such as the delay (due to the congestion of the Courts) in the hearing of claims and appeals lor compensation, are inevitable in present circumstances and can, to some extent, ne alleviated by advances made by my Department on the recommendation of the Jrisl) Grants Committee; others can, I hope, be dealt with by representations to the tree
State Government; and still others, due to the present economic position in the Free State, are hardships which the loyalists share with the whole body of Free State citizens. There remain, however, two classes of hardship which are real and pressing and which I feel I must bring to the notice of my colleagues even though I fear that in the case of one of them there is little that we can do. These are the depreciation of the Stock issued under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, and the fact that many of the losses arising out of the disturbances both before and since the Treaty are not and never have been recognised as losses for which statutory compensation can be granted.Under the Damage to Property Act, all awards (except awards containing a condition as to reinstatement which are only payable as and when the reinstatement takes place) exceeding  500 are payable partly in cash and partly in Stock, and in no case is more than  2,000 payable in cash. The Stock is a 5 per cent. Stock, redeem-able at par by annual drawings, so that the whole will be redeemed in not more than, ten years from the date of issue. So far as I am aware, only a small proportion of the amount-which will ultimately be issund has as 3^et been issued; and until a short time ago the market price steadily declined until it stood at 87. It has recently risen to 92, but it seems clear that it will be liable to fluctuation and for some years is likely to stand several points below par.Many of the persons to whom this stock has been issued in satisfaction of their claims have lost property furniture, clothes, farm implements, &amp;c. which it is essential for them to replace and for the purchase of which cash is necessary. &quot;Where, as in most cases, the loss occurred two years or more before the award is paid, they have been obliged to borrow money at high rates of interest which they are now called on to repay.   In such depreciation of even 1 per cent, is a realhardship, and one against which, I think, we can and ought to protect them.The Colonial Office already has authority to make advances to sufferers on the security of prospective awards of compensation, and has advanced some  200,000 in this manner. Many of the awards on the prospective security of which advances were made have now been paid to the Colonial Office in virtue of the assignments held by that Department as security for the advance. Strictly speaking, we should now demand repayment of the advance in cash in every such case; and if the borrower cannot raise the cash we should sell the stock and recoup ourselves from the proceeds. I propose, however, subject to the concurrence of the Treasury, that in all such cases, unless we are specifically requested by the borrower to sell the stock which has been assigned to us, we should permit the advance (on which no interest is payable) to stand over, retaining as security stock to the nominal value of the advance, and hold it until it reaches par or maturity, thus protecting the borrower against depreciation; we should, of course, in the meanwhile, receive the &quot;dividends on the stock retained by us.The above would apply only to cases in which we have already made advances. I should further propose that in any case in which we are satisfied that an original holder of compensation stock is in need of cash to re-establish himself we should be authorised, so long as the stock remains below par, to advance cash on the security of an equivalent amount of stock taken at its nominal value. It is obvious that caution would need to be observed in exercising this authority otherwise we might be called upon to liquidate the entire issue : but I have no doubt&apos;that it will be possible without much difficulty to discriminate between cases in which cash is really needed and those in which it is desired to raise cash merely for the purpose of investing it in some more stable security.I believe that these measures, if carried into effect, will afford an adequate remedy for the hardships caused by the depreciation of this stock. It must be recognised that the result will be that for the next ten years the British Government will hold a large amount of this stock, and that in the event of any serious economic or political upheaval occurring in the Irish Free State (an event which I must not be understood to anticipate) we may have to bear the loss which, but for our inter-vention, the original sufferers must have borne. I think it is right that we should accept this not very serious risk.It will be seen that both these proposals namely, that we should carry over outstanding advances rather than redeem them by the sale of stock, and that we should be prepared to make fresh advances on the security of the stock are made on the recommendation of the Irish Grants Committee.The second hardship arises from the fact that under the Free State Damage to Property Act, compensation for consequential losses is specifically excluded; and [13140] b 2
it has always been a ground of complaint that by this provision claimants have-been deprived oh a right to compensation which they enjoyed under the old Criminal and Malicious Inj uries Acts. It is not the case, however, that there was any right to compensation for consequential loss, except perhaps to a very limited extent, under the old Acts. Such compensation was, in fact, awarded in a number of cases during the period when local authorities refused to appear in opposition to claims for compensation; but two such judgments were reversed by the Court of Appeal shortly before the Treaty, and in reviewing awards the Wood-Renton Commission has acted on these^ Appeal Court decisions and has disallowed compensation awarded by the Courts in respect of consequential loss.It nevertheless remains the fact that very heavy consequential losses have been suffered; and a number of deplorable cases arising both before and after the Truce have been brought to the notice of the Colonial Office either direct or throuo-h the Southern Irish Loyalists Relief Association. GThe extreme difficulty of dealing with this problem will be obvious. The assessment of compensation within the rigid lines of a statute is difficult enough; the moment you attempt to go outside the statute the difficulties are increased&apos; enormously and the potential liability is inestimable. The loss of wages and profits, the loss of the potential value of hypothetical harvests, can all be traced back to definite injuries, and no firm line can be drawn to distinguish a remote loss from one less remote. To these considerations must be added the fact that the losses in question (in so far as they occurred after the Treaty) arose in a self-governing Dominion, in wdiose domestic affairs we have no right or power to intervene and whose Government, in excluding consequential loss from compensation, is following a precedent more than once set by ourselves, e.g., in South Africa and in the Indemnity Act of 1920.It seems to me clear that it would be impossible for the British Government to provide any general measures of relief for such cases, e.g., to set up, as has been several times proposed in the Press and elsewhere, a Tribunal in this country to administer funds supplied from the Exchequer. It will, however, be observed that the Irish Grants Committee propose, in paragraph 16 of their Report, that they should be authorised to give ex gratia relief in a very limited number of exceptional cases of this kind arising before the Truce; and I would suggest that this recommendation might be extended so as to cover a similarly limited number of cases of special hardship arising after the Truce. I believe that the material for dealing with such cases is already before the Committee or before my Department, i.e., that it would be unnecessary to invite applications for exceptional treatment of this kind, an invitation which would, of course, result in a flood of applications. It may be possible in this way to palliate some of the worst cases; but it must, I think, be finally recognised that we can do no more than this, and that the great bulk of consequential and indirect losses arising not only since but also before the Truce must remain uncompensated.I think it right at this point to make it clear that in my opinion wTe cannot take the view that any action taken by us in this matter is taken in default of action by the Free State Government or that an obligation rested on them which they have failed to discharge. The provision debarring compensation for consequential loss seems to me, for. the reasons I have already given, a not unreasonable provision, and it would be quite unfair to suggest, as has been suggested, that the Free State Government have relieved themselves of a liability in this respect at the sole expense of the &quot;loyalists.&quot; On the contrary, I think it is certain that substantially the greater part of such losses will fall upon those who are in the fullest sense Free State citizens, and I do not think we can expect that the Free State Government should discriminate in favour of the loyalists. ^There is one other matter arising out of the question of compensation to which the Duke of Northumberland did not refer but which.is dealt with in the Irish Grants Committee&apos;s Report, and that is the question of reinstatement. . A considerable proportion of. the awards granted under the Damage to Property Act are granted on the condition that the whole or part of the compensation shall be expended in reinstating the destroyed property. The Free State Government are entJtlec, I think, to take the view that if they put the injured person back in the position he was in prior to the injury^namely, in the position of being the owner ot an undamaged property in the Irish Free&apos; State-they have fully compensated him tor the injury; but the fact remains that a reinstatement condition is a considerable hardship to the property owner, who feels that he cannot live in the Free State, oi at least does not wish to do so, any longer.    It is true that in such a case he ca
ask the Court to permit the award to be devoted to the construction of a different kind 6f&quot;building or buildings, and cases have come to the notice of my Department in which the holder of a conditional decree is building, e.g., a row of suburban villas which he can let or sell at a profit; but even so, the position of an absentee owner of house property is troublesome and often unprofitable.In the case of awards made by the Wood-Renton Commission, the Free State Government, with our concurrence, has occasionally commuted reinstatement conditions at a discount, and the two Governments are now discussing a proposal, to which the Free State are not in principle opposed, that an option to commute, at a discount still to be agreed upon, shall be offered to all holders of Wood-Renton awards to which such a condition is attached. I propose to suggest in due course to the Free State Government that a similar option should be given in all post-truce cases; but it must be recognised that it is open to them to decline to accede to this proposal, and that in any case the option will be subject to a substantial discount, which will probably be not less than 25 per cent.If this is all we can do, in addition to the compensation provided by the Wood-Renton Commission or under the Damage to Property Act, for those who have suffered losses arising out of the conflict prior to the Treaty or the civil strife after the Treaty and I do not see how we can do more it seems clear that we cannot do much for the landowners. As a class they seem to me to have suffered less than very many others for whom we can do little or nothing; and a part of their losses are due to general economic conditions, and a general change in the position of the land-owning class, which are not peculiar to the Irish Free State.The Irish Grants Committee are already authorised to make advances to persons having claims, either in respect of arrears of rent or of the purchase price of land, under the Land Act; but they have felt bound in every case to ensure that they have a sufficient and undoubted security for their advances. Owing to the doubt as to the amount of deduction to be made for taxes, rates, tithes, &amp;c, in the payment of arrears of rent, and as to the incidence and effect of superior interests on the allocation of the purchase price, they have had to refuse advances in a number of cases in which such advances would probably have been justified; and I think that if it were recog-nised that a wider discretion than they have hitherto felt justified in exercising might properly be exercised by them they might do a good deal more than they are able to do at present to tide the landowners over the difficult period until the work of the Land Commission under the new Act is completed.To summarise these proposals, I suggest -(1.) That the Irish Grants Committee should be continued in being.(2.) That we should permit advances made by the Grants Committee to remainoutstanding on the security of an equivalent amount of CompensationStock taken at its nominal value. (3.) That we should be prepared to make advances on the security of Compensa-tion Stock up to its full nominal value. (4.) That the Grants Committee should be authorised to take into considerationwith a view to an ex gratia grant a limited number of exceptional cases of losses arising prior to the Truce for which no compensation is provided. (5.) That a convenient opportunity should be taken of inviting the Free state to consider whether an option could not be given to the holders of awardsunder the Damage to Property Act to which a condition of reinstatementis attached to commute such awards at a fixed discount. (6.) That the Grants Committee should be authorised to take similar action tothat indicated at (4) above in post-truce cases. (7.) That the Grants Committee should be authorised to continue to make advances to claimants under the Land Act, 1923, on the lines alreadylaid down.Nos. (2), (3), (4) and (5) of these proposals are made on the recommendation of the Grants Committee (see paragraphs 13, 14, 16 and 17 of their Report).I am in communication with the Treasury regarding the remaining proposals, relating to refugees and to personal injuries, contained in the Report of the Grants Committee. These are somewhat outside the scope of this Memorandum, and I do not think it necessary to trouble my colleagues with them, beyond saying that I fully agree with the Committee in their recommendations.[13140]b 3
I am conscious that the proposals which I have made fall very far short of affording a complete remedy for the difficulties and losses inevitably arising out of a violent change, such as has taken place in Ireland, in the form of government of a country. But I feel that these proposals, added to the operations of the Wood-Renton Commission and the Damage to Property Act, go as far as it is possible to go, and that we must make up our minds that, unless some unforeseen change in circumstances takes place, the British Government has now done all that it can do to heal the injuries of the past five years. We must recognise that during those years Ireland has been in a state of civil war; and civil war necessarily involves great suffering on the population of the country in which it occurs. Only a small propor-tion of that suffering can in any circumstances be compensated in money; and even though we were to add many millions to the sums which we and the Government of the Free State have expended, we should by no means have got to the end. The proposals which I have made seem to me to give some sort of line of distinction between losses which we can reasonably compensate and those which we cannot; if we go beyond that line if we attempt to give any general compensation for consequential loss or for the difference between what the landowners have got and what they might have got had the course of history been different I do not know where we shall be able to stop.L. S. AMERY.Colonial Office, May 1925.APPENDIX I.Report of the Irish Grants Committee.(Confidential.)Sir, January 16, 1925.ON the 16th January, 1924, we had the honour to present to His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, a report on our pro-ceedings up to the 31st December, 1923. We are now able to submit a final review of our operations, together with certain conclusions and recommendations we have drawn therefrom, for your consideration.Your predecessor, Mr. Thomas, appointed Lord Arnold of Hale as our Chairman on the 16th July, 1924, and he was succeeded by Lord Eustace Percy, who resumed the chairmanship in November 1924.Mr. H. C. Charleton, Member of Parliament for South Leeds, and Mr. C. H. Darbishire, Member of Parliament for the Westbury Division, were appointed members of the Committee in February 1924. On Mr. Darbishire&apos;s resignation in May, Mr. L. B. Franklin, O.B.E., Member of Parliament for the Central Division of Hackney, was appointed to the vacancy. Mr. Franklin resigned in November 1924.2. During the year 1924 we have dealt with 5,236 applications for assistance and have made grants or loans to the amount of  30,412 0$. 4e . In the same period we have submitted recommendations to the Secretary of State for the payment of advances on the security of decrees or well-founded claims for compensation to the total sum of  73,989, and these recommendations have been acted upon. In addition, we have advanced the sum of  13,755 to claimants under the Irish Land Act, 1923. A statement is annexed (Appendix (I) ) showing the total grants, loans and advances made by the Committee since its inception.3. The Irish Distress Committee, as established in May 1922, was intended to deal with a temporary emergency, but unfortunately events in Ireland rendered necessary a protracted existence and an extension of functions. The terms of reference given to the Committee on its reconstruction in March 1923 under its present title, have enabled us to review many aspects of the interlocked questions of relief and compensation.4. After careful deliberation, we have arrived at the conclusion that the Committee&apos;s continuation as at present constituted is no longer necessary, and we submit the following recommendations with a view to the termination of our activities by the 31st March,.1925 : -
Relief Branch.5. We are glad to be able to report that a large number of refugees have obtained employment in this country or have, with our assistance, emigrated.6. In our last Report we recommended that the desirability of making resettle-ment grants and providing annuities in cases of a certain class should be taken into consideration in framing the Estimates for the current financial year. With the provision thus made, we have been able to resettle a few of the refugees whose return to the Free State was, in our opinion, impossible and who were unable to secure employment.7. There still remain a few cases which we propose to remove from our books by-making resettlement grants and, in a few cases of old age or infirmity, by the provision of an annuity. Applications for relief have not ceased even now. A number of people still seek our assistance, having quite recently had to leave Ireland as the result of intimidation or personal violence directed against them, and assistance has been given to these refugees where necessary. We fear that the state of affairs throughout the area of the Irish Free State renders it probable that for some time to come a number of men and women may consider themselves obliged to abandon their homes and seek refuge in this country.8. If this fact, however, were to be regarded as making the continued existence of our Committee necessary, we do not see how any term could be placed to its con-tinuance. We cannot with any confidence expect the complete restoration of settled conditions for some years to come. The responsibility for the protection from persecution of residents in the Irish Free State rests with the Government of that Dominion, and, though His Majesty&apos;s Government may feel that a certain moral responsibility rests also upon them, in this connection we do not consider that a special committee of this kind is any longer the proper medium for meeting this responsibility.9. In May 1922 the Irish Provisional Government accepted liability for the expenditure incurred, on the advice of this Committee, in relieving the pecuniary distress of refugees from their area, and claims have been submitted in respect of such expenditure up to May 1924. It has, however, been agreed in principle, and the Estimate for the current financial year laid before Parliament so provides, that the whole of the gross expenditure is not necessarily recoverable from that source. Further, the Provisional Government stated that they anticipated that normal conditions would be re-established in Ireland by July of 1922, and that they wTould regard it as one of their immediate duties to secure the restoration of their homes and property to any persons who have suffered deprivation by violence or intimidation at the hands of a lawless section of the community. Unfortunately, owing to circum-stances beyond their control, these expectations still remain unfulfilled. It became a paramount necessity to resettle the refugees in this country, involving expenditure to a greater extent than was at first foreseen. We are aware that the Government-of the Irish Free State have recently intimated that they can no longer agree that the provision of monies for the relief of distress among refugees is justified, and while, on the facts of cases recently reported to you, we are obliged to dissent from their contention, we recommend that, if the work of our Committee is to be wound up, no further claim for refund in connection with that work should be made.Advances on Compensation.10. We have observed with some satisfaction during the present year, the accelerated settlement made by the Irish Free State Government of the awards of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission in pre-truce cases, which has resulted in the number of applications for advances on such claims falling far short of our expectations.11. There has, however, been very considerable delay in the assessment of claims and in the payment of awards under the Irish Free State Damage to Property (Compensation) Act of 1923. We recognise that applications for advances on such claims will continue to be received for some time to come, but we recommend that the task of considering such applications should be transferred to the Colonial Office, and dealt with as a purely departmental matter.12. With regard to the repayment of advances already made under that measure, a task entrusted to your Committee in July of the present year, we understand that the procedure which has been adopted has received the approval of your advisers and we suggest that the existing machinery should similarly be transferred to the Colonial Office.
13. We would take this opportunity of calling your attention to the fact that the securities issued in part discharge of awards made under the Free State Compensation Act are only realisable at a discount of approximately 10 per cent As the Exchequer are debarred from receiving repayment of advances otherwise than in cash, and as forced sale at this heavy discount necessarily involves hardship to the claimant, we recommend that the Colonial Office should, where necessary accept stock at its face value against the outstanding advance, holdinc it until redemption or maturity without calling on the claimant to make sale at an unfavourable price.14. We also advise that the Colonial Office should be prepared to make advances to holders of decrees or awards in cases where they are obliged to realise the whole or part of the stock issued to them in discharge of such awards or decrees.Personal Injury Compensation.15. There has been brought to our notice some cases of pre-truce personal injury to Crown supporters, who were unable to recover compensation owing to the circum-stances in which their injuries were sustained. Prior to our dissolution we would request authority to investigate such cases with a view to recommending the payment of an ex gratia grant where such in our opinion appears necessary. We desire also to take a similar course in the case of certain persons who sustained personal injuries after the 11th July, 1921, but who were unable to recover adequate compensation owing to the repeal of the Criminal Injuries (Ireland) Acts. The amount involved in these recommendations cannot be definitely ascertained until we are in possession of the necessary authority to investigate the cases in detail, but would probably not exceed  15,000.Property Compensation.16. We have been impressed with the severe hardship suffered by Crown supporters prior to the Truce where the losses did not give rise to a claim for compensation. These cases, the majority of whioh have already been brought to your notice, are distinguished by reason of the fact that the losses arose mainly as the result of assistance given to Crown forces. We therefore recommend that authority be given us to investigate the few cases of which we already have cognizance with a view to submitting a specific recommendation for the grant of ex gratia compensation from British funds, but we could not recommend that we should be given authority to investigate any new cases of this kind.17. A further point which has been brought frequently to our notice by claimants under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, is that the great majority of awards are made subject to reinstatement conditions. There are owners of property who feel that they cannot with safety return to Ireland or, in view of the destruction of their homes, or the persecution to which they have been subjected, do not wish either to return to or build in the Irish Free State. In these cases a conditional award, unless it can readily be sold for approximately its face value, does not afford adequate compensation. We would accordingly recommend that representations be addressed to the Government of the Irish Free State with a view to arrangements being made by that Government for the composition of such awards for a cash payment.Conclusions.18. The expenditure which your Committee propose to incur in the termination of the Relief Branch of their work can be met from their existing Vote. The amount involved in the recommendations which we have submitted in this Report for further authority will not in all probability exceed  35,000.19. The payment of this sum will, of course, not meet, and is not intended to meet, the demand frequently made by Irish loyalists that His Majesty&apos;s Government should supplement out of the Imperial Exchequer the compensation provided by the Free State Government. It is only intended to wipe off our books persons who have come to us and for whom we have become in a measure responsible. But it must be remembered that these cases cannot be clearly differentiated in principle from many other cases. We think it probable indeed that we have had under our notice the. majority of cases arising before the Truce, which His Majesty&apos;s Government couia under any conditions be expected to recognise, and among the cases which have com under our notice, those for which we have accepted any responsibility are, we thinK, the most urgent and the most deserving.   It is improbable that His Majesty
Government will be asked to consider many cases falling within this category after the winding-up of the&quot; Committee, though some such claims will no doubt be received.20. The same cannot, however, be said of cases arising since the Truce. A certain number of these cases are covered by the recommendations we have made in this report. If these recommendations are adopted, the greater number of personal-injury cases will probably have been dealt with, but there will certainly be a large number of cases of damage to property where claimants will allege that they have been unjustly treated, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government have a moral obligation to them. The Damage to Property (Compensation) Act has only recently been put into full operation, and we cannot therefore judge how far allegations as to the inadequacy of the compensation provided under it are really justified. Similar allegations were freely made in regard to the awards of the Wood-Renton Commission in pre-truce cases, but His Majesty5s Government declined to assume the responsibility of reviewing or reinvestigating those awards, and we hardly think that they will be able to adopt any different attitude towards the decrees given by the courts under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act.21. Apart from the question of the adequacy of the compensation provided under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, there will also be the question, in ielation to this Act as in relation to the Criminal Injuries Acts in force before the Truce, of losses which do not give rise to any claim for compensation. In addition the Southern Irish Loyalists Relief Association have recently brought to our notice a large number of cases of continued persecution and suffering among loyalists who have remained in the Free State. We cannot undertake to- recommend what policy His Majesty5s Government should adopt in such cases.22. At the conclusion of our last report, we drew the Duke of Devonshire5s special attention to the services of our Secretary, Major A. Reid Jamieson, in the following words : &quot; We cannot conclude our report without expressing our high appreciation of our secretary&apos;s services during the past two years. The organisation and efficient administration of our work has been from the beginning a very difficult task, and we believe that our opinion of Major Reid Jamieson5s ability, tact and courtesy, is shared by every one of the many hundreds of persons who have applied to us for assistance. If our work has been in any way successful the credit is mainly due to him, and we should like to call your Grace5s special attention to his services.55Our experiences since that report was made has accentuated our obligations tohim.We again desire to acknowledge in a very special manner the invaluable services he has rendered, and once more to call attention to the marked administrative ability displayed by him.We have the honour to be,Your most obedient Servants, (Signed) EUSTACE PERCY.H.
