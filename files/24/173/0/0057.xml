Circulated to the  Cabinet by direction o.fJCiie Secretary of Scate for Foreign Affaire, Qj^A ^[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;.]&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;   &quot; &quot;1Ugermany.confidentia:[May 14, 1925.]Section 3.No. 1.[C 6493/459/18]Translation of the French Draft Note to Germany on the Subject of Security. -(For French text communicated to Mr. Austen Chamberlain on May 14 by the French Ambassador, see &quot; Germany &quot; print, May 14, Section 1.)Draft Reply to the German Memorandum.AS they have informed the German Government in their note of the 20th February last, the French Government have studied, in common with their allies, the suggestions contained in the memorandum forwarded to them on the 9th February by his Excellency M. von Iloesch.The French Government and their allies regard the step taken by the German Government as an earnest of pacific intentions which agree with their own.Wishing to give to all the States concerned supplementary guarantees of security within the framework of the Treaty of Versailles, they have examined the German proposals with all the attention that they merit in order to judge what elements they may afford for the consolidation of peace.Before embarking, however, on an examination in detail of the German note, it has appeared desirable to set out clearly the questions which it raises, or may raise, and on which it is important to know the views of the German Government because a preliminary agreement concerning them appears to be the necessary basis for any future negotiations: &apos; : l-The memorandum only mentions incidentally the League of Nations.Now the Allied States are members of the League of Nations and are bound by the Covenant of the League, which involves for them clearly defined rights and obligations with the object of maintaining general peace.The German proposals no doubt lay claim to the same ideal, but no agreement could be achieved unless Germany on her side assumes the obligations and enjoys the rights laid down in the covenant of the League.This agreement, then, can only be conceived if Germany herself enters the League of Nations under the conditions laid down in the note from the Council of the League of Nations dated the 13th March, 1925.&quot; v&quot; ; Ti. . I&apos;&apos;-:   &apos;The search for the guarantees of security which the world demands cannot involve any modification of the peace treaties.The agreements to be concluded Ought not, therefore, either to imply a revision of these treaties or to result in practice in the modification of the conditions laid down for the application of certain of their clauses.Thus the Allies cannot in any case give up the right to oppose any failure to observe the stipulations of these treaties, even if the stipulations in question do not directly concern them.III.The memorandum of the 9th February contemplates first of all the conclusion between the &quot; Powers interested in the Rhine &quot; of a pact which might be inspired by the following principles : -1. Repudiation of all idea of war between the contracting States.2. Strict respect for the existing territorial situation in the Rhineland, with a joint and several guarantee by the contracting States.3. A guarantee by the contracting States of the execution of the obligations concerning the demilitarisation of the Rhineland which Germany has undertaken under articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles. [950 o- 31
The French Government do not fail to appreciate the value to the cause of peace side by side with a renewed affirmation of the principles inscribed, in the Treaty [of Versailles], of a solemn repudiation of all idea of war (an undertaking which moreover, ought not to contain any time-limit) between the contracting States.Those States must clearly include Belgium, who is not expressly named in tbe German memorandum and who ought to be a party to the pact as a State directlv interested.It also goes without saying, and further results from the silence on this point of the German memorandum, that the pact to be concluded on these lines could not affect the provisions of the treaty relative to the occupation of the Rhineland, nor the execution of the conditions laid down in relation thereto in the Rhineland Agreement.IV.The German Government next declare jthemselves prepared to conclude with France and with the other States, parties to the Rhineland pact, arbitration treaties guaranteeing &quot;a peaceful settlement of juridical and political conflicts.&quot;France considers that such arbitration treaties would be the natural complement of a Rhineland pact. But it must be understood that they should apply to all disputes of whatever nature, and should not leave room for coercive action save in case of failure to observe the provisions of the various treaties and agreements contemplated in the present note. To give full effect to these treaties their observance ought to he assured by the joint and several guarantee of the Powers who participate in the territorial guarantee contained in the Rhineland pact.V.In their memorandum the German Government added that they were ready to conclude with all States who were so disposed arbitration treaties of the same kind.The Allied Governments note this assurance with satisfaction. They even consider that, in the absence of such agreements between Germany and those of her neighbours who, without being parties to the suggested Rhineland pact, are signatories of the Treaty of Versailles, the object aimed at by the pact could not be attained nor the peace of Europe completely guaranteed.The Allied States, in fact, have, under the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Treaties of Peace, rights which they cannot possibly give up and obligations of which they cannot possibly divest themselves.The arbitration treaties thus conceived would have the same scope as those contemplated in paragraph IV and would be backed by the same joint and several guarantee.VI.In the opinion of the French Government the general guarantee of security necessary for the maintenance of peace cannot be effectively assured unless the agreements contemplated in the present note form an indivisible whole.They consider therefore that all the agreements, the observance of which should in each case be guaranteed by the signature of the same Powers, ought to be ^co-ordinated in a general convention registered by the League of Nations, placed under the auspices of the League and capable of forming, as suggested in the German memorandum itself, the nucleus of a still more general pacific entente.Finally, it goes without saying that if the United States were to find it possible to associate themselves with the agreements which would thus be realised,,France would be only too happy to see the great American nation participate in this -work of general peace and security.Such are the principal points on which it has appeared necessary to&apos; obtain precise knowledge of the views of the German Government.The Allied Governments would be glad to receive a reply on this subject which will permit the opening of negotiations with the object of concluding agreements which ivill constitute a new and effective guarantee of peace.May 12, 1925.
