(Fisher Committee,- first interim report to the Cabinet, 1919)*The Naval scales of pay do not at present carry out this intention.    It has been shown by actual figures that Naval Officers generally, up to, at any rate, the rank of senior Commander or Post-Captain, after allowing for the absolute minimum of necessary Service expenditure, have the barest margin left on whioh to support a home unless they have private means.   The position is most serious between the ages of 30 and 40.    (See Appendix I.)The Committee has not attempted to deal with this, which is the fundamental point.    Their report deals with the question solely from the point of view of relativity.   The fact that the naval pay is inadequate for the needs of Married Officers, unless
This /they have private means has not been disputed or disproved. It has simply been dropped out of sight in the Report, and I ask the Cabinet to take note of the fact.Passing now to the question of relativity, the disadvantage at which the married Haval Officer is placed as compared with the married Officer in either of the other two Services appears at once from the fact that at the crucial age of 50, which the Fisher Committee took as the point when, the State should recognise Officers as entitled to marry, the Naval Officer; though married/ only receives  517 a year whilst the married Army Officer, who at that age is of a lower rank and admittedly has much less responsibility, receives . ,583, and the Air Force Officer only a little less (apart from his Risk Pay)6It would be tedious to follow out the comparison indetail, but it may be stated in a sentence that certainly upto the ranks of,Post-Captain and Full Colonel, wherever Naval and Army OfficersOfficers/are of the same age and rank&apos;, the married Army Officer receives considerably higher emoluments than the Naval Officer, and for part of the time receives ^ igiEr emoluments even when of the same age but of a lower rank,    (See Appendix IIo)    The comparison of  the Post-Captain and the Full Colonel is not so easy to make, but so far as the Admiralty can ascertain the .statement remains true here also    In any case, howeverf only 20$ of Naval Executive Officers who reach the marriage age (30) can ultimately become Post-Captains, and I think it Is admitted that the situation which applies to 80$ of Officers conoerned must be regarded as typical0
This situation has arisen owing to the fact that when the Service rates of pay were revised by the Fisher Committee in 1919, the Admiralty put before that Committee a scheme of pay based on equal payment for married and unmarried Officers as being that best suited to the Navy, whereas the other two Services, whose schemes were worked out subsequently, adopted the system of higher pay in the form of Marriage Allowance for married Offloors,That the Fisher Committee and the Admiralty did not grasp the fact that the adoption of this system by the other two Services would have such unequal results as to make the Naval position before long an impossible one, is clear.     I cannot, however, admit the conclusion that because the Admiralty made this mistake In 1919 the Navy must suffer for it permanently.   You cannot treat a great Service in this way,     To subject married Naval Officers for the next 30 years to privations, because the Board In 1919 failed to grasp the full effect of the War Office proposals, may result in the memory of those respon-sible for the blunder being remembered with bitterness but will not gt-rike the Naval Service as just or reasonable,Moreover /
Moreover, since 1919 the situation haa developed to the detriment of the Navy in a manner which it would have been almost impossible to foresee at that time.   thus, the. fact that a large portion of the married Army Officer&apos;s emoluments was put into the shape of allowances has resulted in this portion being received free of Income Tax,whereas the whole of the Naval Officer&apos;s receipts have borne Income Tax. The placing of the Allowances on a sliding scale, has had the consequence that they have actually been increased since 1919o    In some cases the Increase in the Allowances has practically balanced the        reduction of Service pay which took effect .last year, and In all cases It has at least halved it, so that whereas married Naval Officers have had their 1919 emoluments actually diminished by &amp;k%t corresponding Officers in the Army have had their 1919 emoluments diminished by less than 2jg% and in the case of same ranks by less than 1$. Further, It has been ruled since 1919 that when a married Army Officer is separated from his family for Service reasons, he draws not only the married allowances for his family but a bachelor&apos;s allowances for himself.    It is argued that this is a small matter because only 4.7 per cent of married Army Officers are In this situation, but as It Is the normal situation of Naval Officers it has further increased the inequality which exists between the two Services.In view of the above, I am at a loss to understand how the Committee could conclude that the position lias not changed to the detriment of the Navy since the Admiralty agreed to the Fisher Committee scales.It is now argued that It would be impossible to grant-marriage allowances to officers, because lower rates of. pay for men are being considered.   But unless pledges given to the men now serving are going to be broken, the lower rates of
pay for the men will, be for new entrants only, and willhe accompanied by hew scales of pay for future officers also.On the other hand if existing naval officers are not to have Marriage Allowance, I believe it will be impossible to apply the principle to future naval officers, and this will add greatly to the difficulty of arriving at new scales, and probably also to their cost.At the end ot their Report; the Committee throws out. the suggestion that the grant of Marriage Aliowanoe now to married $aval Officers ought to be accompanied by a revision of pay of Officers at present, unmarried.   It is a pity that although the Committee examined Departmental witnesses, it never investigated this aspect of the case, which Is very easily answered.So far as It Is the case that the Naval Officer&apos;s pay as fixed in 1919 contained what might he ealled a &quot;married element&quot;, the Admiralty are amply meeting the justice of the case by proposing, a Marriage Allowance of only  118 instead of  1*78 paid to the Army.   Why otherwise should the Naval Marriage Allowance be any less than that paid to the Army/ Officer?     The Army Officer under the age of 30 received In 1919 a much greater increase of pay, both actually and in proportion to his pre-war rate, than the Naval Offioer under 30.     Above that age, the small extent to which the Naval Officer gained over the unmarried Army Officer by receiving a larger proportion of Increase can he seen from the following table:-
Pre-war,     1919   (a) Naval Of floor not pro-mot ed beyond Lt, Gdr, (62$ of the total)277598Retires at 45.(a) Unmarried Army Offr0not promoted beyond Major a,*283566Retires at 50.(b) &quot;Naval Officer not pro promoted beyond Gdr, (20% of total)   0 0................370777Retires at 50,(b) Unmarried Army Offr, not promoted beyond Lt,Colonel0306613Retires at 55 *If the increases given had been in strict proportion the unmarried Naval Officer (a) would have been given  554 instead of  598, and the unmarried Naval Officer (b),  741 instead of  777,The Admiralty carefully considered the possibility of a revision of unmarried Officersr pay as a condition of the grant of Marriage Allowance, but decided that it was preferable to propose a Marriage Allowance so much lower than that existing in the Army as to render this revision unnecessary.The Admiralty proposals are moderate and are the minimum that will relieve the position of serious financial strain under which married Naval Officers are now placed,    I have yet to learn the details of a single claim that either of the other two services could legitimately base upon them.It must be remembered, that  the House has Voted  350,000 for the cost of these allowances subject to any adjustments that might be made by the Cabinet after the consideration of the Report of the Co-ordinating Committee *If the allowances are refused altogether, the disappointment of a large body of Members of Parliament will be very great.(Initialled)W. 0 , B,26, 5, 1925c
