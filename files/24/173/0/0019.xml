9 1 1-BOCnMBBT&quot; XS- -TJ3E-PRtJP7IRTX^^ GOTIML23OT ).217 (25)0 A 3 1 SET. THAWLIHG 121 THE 32DRAY FIRTH. Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland,li On the 20th November lest the Cabinet had beforethem the question whether the subject of trawling in the Iforay Firth should be raised in the course of negotiations which had been oossaenoed with Norway on the subject of territorial waters.      The Cabinet decided that the Moray Firth question should not be raised in those negotiations but that the first possible opportunity should be sought to raise the question at the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.2. The negotiations with Norway for an Agreementrelating to territorial waters here now been discontinued. Proposals intended to be the basis of consideration by the respective Governments were adjusted at a meeting of experts held in Oslo in December. The Norwegian proposals proved on examination to be quite unacceptable and the Foreign Office have intimated that K.M. Government are not prepared to continue the discussion on those lines.3. The Foreign Office have, however, instructedK.H. Minister at Oslo to inform the Norwegian Government that H.M.&apos; Government would be glad to conclude an Agreement with Norway relating to the fisheries,     A copy of the Foreign Office telegram dated 31st Karch is annexed,4, In my view the decision of the Cabinet on 20thNovember which related to negotiations for a Territorial Waters Agreement does not apply to the proposed negotiations for a Fisheries Agreesient,     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has however informed me that he takes the contrary view,5, It appears to me that the situation is entirely different from that which was before the Cabinet on 20th November and that a different decision la called for with respect to the raising of the question of the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde in the new negotiations.In November what was contemplated was a Territorial Waters. Agreement covering all purposes, e.g., belligerency, merchant shipping, nationality as well as fisheries.     How what is contemplated is an Agreement confined to fisheries to settle aertain outstanding fishery questions between this Country and Norway.     In my view any such Fisheries Agreement should also settle, so far as Norway is concerned, the long outstanding question of trawling in the Horay Firth which in the past lias raised acute difficulties between the two countries.     I anticipate that H.M. Government will be subjected to severe criticism if in negotiations relating to the fisheries, they refrain from raising this question, especially in view of the facts that lord/
lord Mackenzie!s Commatteo appointed &quot;by the last Unionist Government recoEmended &quot;that energetic -measures &quot;be taken to secure the international recognition of the closure of the Moray Firth to trawling&quot; and that the Labour Government raised this question with Norway.in march 1924. The proposed Fisheries Agreement will, I understand, neoessi tate legislation.When the matter was previously before the Cabinet the Foreign Secretary laid stress on the argument that this country and Norway would be the only parties to the Agreement then proposed.     Now, however, it is recognised that it would be undesirable to agree to restrict the fishing rights of British trawlers off the boasts of Norway unless similar restrictions are to apply to the trawlers of Germany and of any other Nations concerned.     It is therefore proposed that the Fishery Agreement should only bind this country if Germany also accedes to it;    and a similar stipulation may become necessary with respect to other Powers.Accordingly the proposed Fishery Agreement with Norway may become the nucleus of an Agreement with other Powers.     Thi3 makes it the more important that the opportunity should be taken of using the Agreement as a means of settling the question of the Moray Firth and the Firth of Clyde with such other Powers and in particular with Germany.   &apos; Although the Koray Firth question is comparatively quiescent at the moment there is nc   doubt that the resumption of regular visits to the Moray Firth by German trawlers would excite considerable feeling and create a position seriously embarrassing to the Government in Parliament.     British trawlers are prohibited from working in the Koray Fii*th,It may be contended that the case is sufficiently met by the previous decision to refer the Koray Firth question to the International Council for the&apos; Exploration of the Sea.     I would, however, point out that it is proposed to recognise the&apos; Varanger Fjord and the Vest Fjord as &quot;exclusive Norwegian fishing areas&quot; without requiring any scientific evidence that such a measure would be in the interest of the fisheries generally.     It is reasonable therefore that Norway should be asked, so far as Dhe is concerned, to accept the proposal respecting the Moray Firth and also the Firth of Clyde in anticipation of scientific proof. liea.sures are, of course, being taken to present the scientific case relating to the&apos;Koray Firth to the International Council,     It must be remembered, however, that the Council cannot do more than record a resolution or a recommendation.     Assuming that it decides in favour of the 3ritish case on the h.oray Firth question, political negotiations with the different Powers concerned will still be necessary with a view to a Fisheries Agreement on the subject.     I submit that in that event it will be of great advantage to have secured in advance the adhesion and support of Norvray and possibly of Germany and other Powers as a result of the present negotiations.My submission therefore to my colleagues ia that the decision taken on 20th November relating to a proposed/
proposed Territorial Waters Agreement affecting only this country and Norway should not he regarded as governing the present -negotiations -xelattojs^no..,a, ^ ^ Fisheries Agreement in which Germany end&quot; possibly other Powers are also concerned;    and that Norway should- -he -asked, as part of the proposed Agreement, to oonsent to subject trawlers flying&apos; the Norwegian flag to the same restrictions in,the Moray Firth and the Firth of Clyde as are imposed on British trawlers.iJOHSr GILMOURi.Scottish Office,28th April, 1925.
