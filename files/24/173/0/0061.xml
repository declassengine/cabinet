Sir John Gilmour, Bt., I), S. 0*(The Secretary for Scotland)    (In the Chair)The Rt,Eon. Sir Arthur St eel-Ma it land , Bt. , M.P; (Tiie Minister of labour)The Rt.Hon. Viscount Peel,  G,BoE. (The First Commissioner of Works)The St.Hon.  Viscount Cecil ox Chelwood, K.C.   &quot; (The Chancellor of the Euchy of Lancaster).2^ The Terms of Reference to the First Committeeincluded the following&quot;To consider the question of Marriage Allowances for the Navy on the under-standing that they should not make proposals liable to result in claims from the other Service Departments in regard to Marriage Allowances&quot;.3. The Committee present the following InterimReport on this p.irt of their Enquiry.4. They have had before them the Interim Report(C.P.loc*(25) ) on Marriage Allowances for the Wavy
presented to the Cabinet by the First Committee, copy of which is attached hereto (See Appendix I),     They have considered Reports of tbe evidence taken by the First Committee and have themselves heard evidence from representatives of the Admiralty, War Office end Treasury,, 5.      The Committee ere unable to recommend that Marriage Allowances should be granted to Naval Officers as an addition to the emoluments allowed under present regulations.      They do not consider that the Admiralty have established a case for disturbing the present re-lativity of emoluments of Officers in the three Fighting Services *The Committee are. however^ of opinion that in principle some allowance for married Officers is right, and if the pay of the three Services came under general review some change in this direction should certainly be considered,6.      The Admiralty urge that the present relativity has proved to be to the disadvantage of Naval Officers, in that the full consequences of the Psy system for the Army and Air Force as accepted by the Fisher Committee of 1919 were not at the time appreciated by their representatives on that Committee, and that certain changes have been made subsequently to the relative detriment of the Naval&apos;Service.     The Committee have not deemed it their duty to undertake the exhaustive investigation which would be necessary to review in detail the complete Fisher Committee settlementi but on a general survey of the question they do not consider that the Fisher Committee failed in its task of correlating fairly the Pay systems of the three Services, nor does there appear to them to have been any material change since 1919 in the relativity of the pay of the three Services.2a    .
70 It has been represented to the Committeethat the liability of Haval Officers to be placed on unemployed pay and half pay is a factor which renders the position of the young married officer particularly difficult.      The Committee were at first inclined to consider that some concession might be&apos; justified on this ground and accordingly gave special consideration to the point.      Statistics were obtained from the Admiralty showing the actual numbers unemployed by ranks and the financial effect of unemployment on average earnings.      The figures for the executive branch of the Savy are given in Appendix II.    (For other branches unemployment is c? less importance).      On the facts disclosed the Committee do not consider that there is a valid claim that marriage allowance should be given on the ground of liability to unemployments8c If the general position of Naval officers were improved by granting Marriage Allowances to married Officers, whilst leaving unmarried Officers in receipt of their present emoluments, the Committee consider that the War Office and Air Ministry could reasonably advance claims for a corresponding general improvement in the pay of their Services u10.o The Committee wish to point  out that substantial reductions are due to be made in the pay of the rank and file of the three Services, and proposals to this effect are before them.      It appears to them to be impracticable to entertain the grant of improved emoluments to Officers at a times when reduced rates of pay are to be introduced for the Men.
10,      If the Admiralty could.secure acceptance by the Fleet of a revised basis of pay which would Include reduced re tea for unmarried Officers now serving, it would then be possible to Improve the position of married Naval Officers; but the Committee recognise that to secure the re-distribution of pay within certain ranks in the Service would be a matter of very great difficultyeSigned -on behalf of the Committee.JOHN GILMGUR,Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 21st May,  1925,-4-

The Committee desire to make an Interim Report onthe question of Marriage Allowances for Naval Officers onwhich they have heard evidence from representatives of theService Departments and the Treasury.3.     The history of finis question is as follows in January, 1919,  the Admiralty appointed a committee under the Presidency of Admiral Sir Martyn Jerrara to review the scales of Naval Pay, the question of Officers&apos;
Pay being dealt with by a Sub-Committee under Admiral Sir Lionel Ealsey.     The Report of this Sub-Co-amittee, which recommended considerable increases of pay, was,  subject to minor qualifications, approved by the Board of Admiralty.      The War Office and the Air Ministry were at that time still considering similar revisions of pay for their personnel.    The Cabinet, therefore, appointed a Committee consisting of representatives of the three Services and of the Treasury under the Chairmanship of Mr. H.A.L. Pisher, to co-ordinate the proposals of the Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry with regard to pay,4-.      The War Office decided to introduce different rates cf remuneration for single and married officers. They did so by giving married officers higher rates of lodging,  fuel and light allowances.      The Admiralty and Air Ministry decided to pay single and married officers alike.      In 1921, however, a difference was introduced between married and single officers in the Air Porce as regards fuel and light allowances.5.      The Committee had., therefore, to lay downsuitable scales of pay for officers of the throeServices which took this difference of system intoaccount,  i.e,, the uniform scales of pay for naval officers had to be in due relation to the averagerates of pay yielded by the different scales for single and married officers adox^ted in the Army.6.     The Piaher Committee finally recommended scales of pay for naval officers practically equivalent tothose already proposed by the Admiralty,, and theirEeports were signed by the Admiralty Representative.- 2 -
y 0       It IB clear, therefore, that the -scales of pay laid down for naval officers by tho Pisher Committee were accepted at the time by the Admiralty as sufficient in themselves and as duly related to the emoluments- of array officers.    i/s have, indeed, little doubt that, but for the introduction of differential married rates in the Array,  no agitation wo uld have arisen for the grant of increased remuneration to married naval officers.80       It is contended by the Admiralty, however, that in fact the if is ho. r Committee (and their own representatives upon it) failed to discharge their duty of correlating remuneration in the three Services and gave an undue advantage to the Army.    It is also contended that the existing emoluments of naval officers are insufficient to suable them to provide adequately for their familiesu 9c       The Admiralty accordingly propose the grant of married allowance .to naval officers on the following scale:-Commissioned officers of and above ) 30 years of&apos; age, up to and including ) officers of captain1s rank ) 6/6 a day(Lieutenants, Bx-mate and Hates from 25 years)Commissioned officers of and above 30 years of age, up to and including officers of captain1s rank ) 4/4 a day(Lieutenants, Bx-mate and Mates from 25 years) when drawing unemployment payCommissioned, officers of Warrantrank ) 4/- a dayWarrant officers from. 25 years of age     3/6 a day the cost of this scheme is estimated to be  350,000 per annum,,10.      The majority of the Committee, the Financial Secretaryto the Admiralty dissenting,  arc of opinion that the caseof the Admiralty has not &quot;been established under either oftho two heads in paragraph 8 above.
11.    The representatives of the War Office and Air Ministry-would, however, be prepared to assent to the grant of a marriage allowance of 3/- a day to Lieutenant-Commanders and Commanders, with a proportionately lower rate for Warrant officers,$ etc, at a oost of approximately  ISO,000 a year, provided that certain claims put forward independently by   them for analogous improvements in the emoluments of Army and Air Force officers were also conceded.12,      The War Office desire to increase the existing scale of lodging allowances for both single and married officers at a cost of approximately  200,000 a year. 13.      The Air   Ministry desire to adopt the Army scales of Married Allowances (including the improvement now asked for by the War Office) at a cost of  69,000 a year. 14,      The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty is unable to modify the claim of his Department for the grant to naval officers up to the rank *f Captain of Marriage Allowances at the rates set forth in paragraph   9 above. 15,      The Committee aan, therefore, only report to the Cabinet that, in view of their Terms of Reference,  they are unable to make any recommendation on the subject of       . Marriage Allowances fa the Navy.      They have not enquired into the merits of the corresponding claims put forward by the War Office and the Air Ministry.NO TP, s    The Financial Secretary to the, Admiraltywishes his dissent.jEYom this,^Reportrppprdefl.Signed on &quot;behalf of the CommitteeJOHN GILMOUR.
