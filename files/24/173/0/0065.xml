SECRET. Copy No. SOCP. 263 (25).CABINET.FORESIGHT AND CO-ORDINATION IN ECONOMIC ENQUIRY.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THERE has always been a slight difficulty in explaining to the general public the precise character of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and the difficulty will not be less in the case of the new organisation which is to be formed on the same model. When dealing with the machinery of administration we are all apt to think in terms of &quot; Departments &quot; and &quot; Committees.&quot; But the Committee of Imperial Defence is neither a Department like other Departments, nor a Com-mittee like other Committees. It is not the first, because it can do nothing but investigate and recommend; it is not the second, because it has no fixed numbers or rigid procedure. No executive officer is under its authority. No Department owes it obedience. No man sits on it as of right except the Prime Minister and those who attend on his invitation. Its duty is to study and advise upon problems which either affect more than one Department or are of so wide a scope that ordinary departmental machinery can hardly be expected to cope with them. Its constitution is so elastic that, like the Cabinet, it may, on occasion, supply a convenient method of bringing into council representatives of the Overseas Dominions whenever they desire it or when a fitting occasion presents itself.The scheme at first sight may seem unduly ambitious. But I do not think it will be difficult to organise or costly to run. This new Advisory Committee should, I think, be linked up with the Committee of Imperial Defence into a kind of dual Department under the general superintendence of the Cabinet Secretary. This arrangement will liot enable us to dispense with the services of a first-class permanent official devoting all his energies to the work of the new Committee ; nor will it in any way subordinate the civil interests, which we are striving to promote, to the naval, military and air force interests which concern the Committee of Imperial Defence.On the other hand, its advantages will be many. It will economise clerical staffs, and, far more important, it will make it clear from the beginning that the new organisation is designed to follow in the footsteps of the old. From the point of view of the Departments, its functions will not be those of a critic, still less of a controller. It will sometimes be called on to assist their work, sometimes to supplement it. In both cases hearty co-operation and complete mutual under-standing are the first conditions of success. These have never been wanting in the case of the Committee of Imperial Defence. I feel sure that its twin organisation will be equally fortunate.As regards the Cabinet, there is one important practical difference between the position of the Committee of Imperial Defence and that of the new Committee of Civil Development which we desire to create.The object aimed at by the first is armed Security, and, though the means of attaining it are exceedingly complicated and raise every kind of problem scientific, administrative and political the end itself is easily understood, commends itself to all and is the sole pre-occupation of three great expert&apos; Departments. In these circumstances, it is comparatively easy to ask the right questions in the right order and to provide the special machinery for finding the right answers.The questions to be considered by the Committee of Civil Development (if I may so name it) cover a much wider range, and it will be a less simple matter to determine their character and to provide the best methods of attempting their solution. I should like, on this aspect of the subject, to consult further with my advisers before suggesting a detailed policy.A. J. B.May 26, 1925.    .[13146]Printed for the Cabinet.
