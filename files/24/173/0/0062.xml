(r-,1 i  locuncnt io the property of His Britannic Majesty1 a Government...)\ G A B I H t; h ..-) i &quot;   -REPRSSEHTATIOP OP THE PEOPLE!  (ECONOMY PROVISIONS) BILL.Memorandum. by the Home Secretary. J ?The Cabinet at their   .meeting on the 11th March decided thata Bill should he prepared providing for a Single Annual Register of electors, and remedying certain small defects in the administrative machinery of the Representation of the People Act, 1918. ^In accordance with this decision the accompanying draft Bill hasbeen prepared after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary for Scotland.    It provides for:-(i) An annual register with a reduced qualifying period of 3 months;(ii)  Simultaneous issues of ballot papers at a polling station;(iii) One advertisement of the summary of candidates expenses instead of two;(iv) Claims against Returning Officers for work, etc., done to be rendered within 14 days; :(v) The official mark to be marked on ballot papers prior to the poll;(vi) The poll in Orkney and Shetland to be open on one day only.The Bill has been given an economy title.    Otherwise,  in view of thediverse subjects dealt with, there would bo no means of preventingI general amendments being movod to the Bill. IOn the general question of introducing the Bill at the present I time I desire to point out that the Government have already a full legislative programme for this Session, and that little time will be available for this Bill which Is highly contentious so far at any 1 rate as regards the proposed annual register.    Moreover, as my I colleagues are aware,  two Bills relating to electoral matters have I already been discussed in the House of Commons,  one relating to the franchise of women, and the other to absent voting at parliamentary   -and local elections, and the Government are committed to a reference of these matters to a Conference of the Political Parties.In tho circumstances, I suggest that the introduction of this measure should be deferred until next session or still better sent jjgto the Conference wo propose to call next year.May,  1925; W.J.H.
APPENDIX. Notes on Glauses.Clause 1.    Annual Register.    The register corresponds to the present Autumn register,- and comes into force on 15th October,  but in order to give longer time for printing and compilation the qualifying period ends on 1st June instead of 15th June. This additional 14 days,  is allotted to the canvassing and electors lists stages,  but some rearrangement of the dates at later stages may be found necessary.    In consequence of the reduced qualifying period,  Schedule one amends Section 7 of the Act of  1918,  which preserves qualifications where a house is let furnished for not more than 4 months in the whole during the qualifying period.    It reduces the letting period to 2 months,  hut if there has been occupation for 6 months, preserves the existing right to let for 4 months. -The Act of 1921 as to the residence of persons on service is also amended.Clause 2.    Issues of Ballot Papers.    This clause recognises a system actually adopted in some Northern towns,  under which the register at a polling station is divided to enable several issues of ballot papers to be made simultaneously.    In such cases a larger number of electors can be allotted to each polling station and fewer Presiding Officers are required.Gl ause 5(1).    Advertisement.of Summary of Candidates&apos; Expenses.    The summary of candidates&apos;  expenses will be published in one newspaper only instead of in two newspapers,  as required by the present law.(2).    Claims against Returning Officers.    The Act of 1918 repealed the former requirement that claims against Returning Officers for work,  etc.,  done should be sent in within 14 days after the return of the election.    The clause revives the requirement.
4.    Official Mark on Ballot Papers.    Under the present law, a ballot paper must be stamped with the official mark immediately, before being handed to the elector.    If through any inadvertence the paper is not stamped,  the vote is not valid and at every general election a considerable number of votes are lost in this way and great dissatisfaction caused in the constituancies concerned.    The Home Office conferred last year with representative Returning Officers and Agents from the Central Offices of the Political Parties as to the possibility of dispensing with the mark, and the conclusion reached was that the stamping of the mark at the polling stations has no advantage as a check against forgery.Under the clause the official mark would be printed or stamped on the ballot papers prior to the poll.    This, will prevent the less of votes from failure at the stations to stamp the papers,  and will also effect considerable economy.At the same time it is proposed tha,t the Returning Officer should have direct power - which at present he does not possess - to take steps to exclude forged ballot papers at the count,  and by Schedule II amendments are made in the Ballot Act,  requiring the ballot paper accounts to be verified before the votes for the  candidates are counted (as is the usual practice) instead of afterwards,  as now required by the Act.    If there is any discrepancy, which appears due to the presence of forged ballot papers in the ballot box, the Returning Officer, who will know the serial numbers of the ballot papers supplied to each station,  is empowered himself to examine  the numbers on their backs to assist in detecting and excluding any forged papers.    Otherwise the numbers on the backs of the ballot papers will not be examined.    Any forged ballot papers will be preserved for examination on petition.
Clause 5.    Poll, in Orkney and Shetland.    The poll for this constituency-is open, for two days,  and as this involves additional cost for the election officials,- it is found impossible to grant the additional polling places which would be given if the poll was on one day only.    It seems that more electors would be benefited by a one day poll with further polling places, and at less cost,  than under the present system of a two days&apos;  poll.Clause 6(8).    Northern Ireland.    One register a year is prepared in Northern Ireland,  but it will be necessary to consult that Government as to whether the reduced qualifying period and other amendments should apply.G46-9
