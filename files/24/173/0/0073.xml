Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1925.CONFIDENTIALCopy No.CABINET.^/i/r-r^ONDC^^C^conference ON SLEEPING SICKNESS.I circulate a further memorandum to show the steps taken inter-departmentally in relation to this conference.The Cabinet is now in possession of all my information on the subject.A. C.May 24, 1925.Memorandum.EARLY in December last we received from the secretariat a report on the work of the Third Session of the Health Committee of the League of Nations, dealing, inter alia, with the recommendations of an expert committee appointed to study the problem of sleeping sickness. Among those recommendations was one for summoning a conference of representatives of colonial Administrations to discuss the financial and administrative possibilities of despatching a special mission to study epidemiological problems connected with sleeping sickness in Equatorial Africa. The report was sent to the Colonial Office and the Ministry of. Health for their observations.The reply of the Colonial Office, which was received on the following day, was to the effect that they had learnt with interest of these recommendations. They would, however, prefer not to express any definite opinion with regard to the proposal for a conference until they had received further information as to the expense involved and the personnel and itinerary of the special mission of enquiry. They suggested that the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of the League should be requested to inform the council, when the matter came under discussion, of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Mr. Chamberlain accordingly carried out this request at the meeting of the council on the 8th December. He expressed the hope that some information might be supplied to the Governments, both as to the scope and place of the enquiry and the expense involved before the colonial Administrations were consulted, and that the Governments would have an opportunity of expressing their opinions on the proposal. Viscount Ishii said that it was for the colonial Administrations to submit proposals to their respective Governments before final action was taken. Mr. Chamberlain said that this was quite satisfactory to him.About a week later the secretariat enquired informally whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be likely to participate in a conference of representatives of colonial Administrations to consider the problem of sleeping sickness. This proposal, which was referred to the Colonial Office, did not commend itself to that Department on the ground that it would involve considerable administrative inconvenience and in some cases dislocate the machinery for combating sleeping sickness in territories where it exists as a serious problem. They suggested, however, that the object which the council had in view might be made by the issue of a questionnaire which could be circulated to the colonial Administrations interested. With regard to the proposal to send a mission of enquiry to Equatorial Africa they declined to express an opinion until they had received further informa-tion as to the expense involved and the personnel and itinerary of the mission. The Colonial Office views were telegraphed to the secretariat. 2884a   [13147]
No further communication was received from Geneva until the 24th December when the secretary-general formally enquired whether &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government would be agreeable to the convening at an early date of a conference of representa-tives of those Governments which have extensive territories in Equatorial Africa to discuss proposals of an administrative character arising out of the technical recommendations of the Health Committee approved by the council. Such a conference would include the representatives of the Governments of Great Britain France, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Portugal. It would be the purpose of the conference to determine the scope of the general administrative measures that might be recommended and also to consider, particularly from an administrative and financial point of view, the despatch of a small mission of enquiry to carry out a careful study in selected regions of-Equatorial Africa of the various problems -associated with the epidemiology of sleeping sickness. Any proposals of the conference would be submitted by its members to their respective Governments for approval.&quot; This invitation was referred to the Colonial Office, but not to the Ministry of Health, who had not replied to our first letter and who were presumably not interested in a conference dealing with an African problem.The reply of the Colonial Office, received in March, was to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government, wdho attached great importance to the problem of sleeping sickness, welcomed the suggestion that such a conference should be convened. They, at the same time, suggested that the conference should take place in London in order that Mr. Ormsby-Gore, whose parliamentary duties made it difficult for him to be absent from this country, should be included in the British delegation. That reply was forwarded to the secretary-general, copies of the correspondence being sent to the Ministry of Plealth for information.The Ministry subsequently intimated that it might facilitate the work of the conference, and, at the same time, be helpful to Sir G. Buchanan, of the Ministry of Health and British member of the Health Committee of the League, if he were informed of the meetings and programme of the conference, when settled. Copies of subsequent correspondence were accordingly supplied to the Ministry.The other Governments consulted by the secretariat having acquiesced, arrange-ments were made for the conference to assemble at the Colonial Office on the 19th May.Foreign Office, May 22, 1925.
