,    , CONFIDENTIAL UBRAHK[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,-]SOUTH-EASTERN  EUROPE. J^J^CONFIDENTIAL.[C 7237/798/19]frX [May 22, 1925.]Section 1.No. 1.Memorandum.ONE of the reasons, and the most important, given by the S.C.S. Government for denouncing the Grasco-Serbian Treaty of Alliance in November 1924, was the handicap imposed irpon their export trade by the incompetent management of the Salonica-Ghevgeli Railway by Greece.The Serbian view is that possession of this line is essential to them, not only because Salonica is the natural outlet for the whole Vardar valley, but also because the traffic conditions under Greek management are so bad that they render the existing arrangement intolerable. That the latter grievance is not without foundation is amply borne out by reports of impartial observers on the spot, but whether it is Greek obstruction or merely Greek incompetence which is responsible is open to question.The Salonica-Ghevgeli Railway runs from the former port to the Serbian frontier, a distance of some 00 kilom. on Greek territory. The Serbs, by means of various financial transactions of a more or less shady character, and thanks to the incom-prehensible lethargy of the Greek Government, are at present the chief shareholders in the line, but the proprietary rights and exploitation of the line are vested in the Greeks, who made it quite clear through M. Veniselos and M. Caclamanos last year that they could not possibly surrender their rights in this respect. Both M. Veniselos and M. Caclarnanos, moreover, averred on separate occasions that the original conces-sion granted by the Porte contained a clause enabling tho Government through whose territory the line ran, in this case the Greek Government, to buy out or expropriate the concessionnaires. A careful perusal of the concession, however, failed to discover the existence of any such clause, and it is to be presumed, therefore, that they were speaking under a misapprehension.In this connection it is worth while to quote from a minute by Mr. Nicolson on a conversation which he had with M. Veniselos on the 24th January last: &quot; I asked what the Greek Government would do supposing one of the first conditions made by the Serbs for tho renewal of this treaty was that this option should be surrendered, and the Serbian hold on the railway formally recognised. M. Veniselos said that this was a point on which the Greeks would never surrender; nor did he think the Serbs would raise it, since M. Nincic had said nothing to him about the railway when they met in Paris. I said that none the less I felt pretty certain that the Serbs would raise the point, and the Greeks might find themselves faced with the alternative of losing either their railway or their treaty. M. Veniselos looked glum, and murmured something about Greece not being a vassal of Serbia.&quot;This almost exactly defines the stage negotiations have now reached in Belgrade. The Serbs, besides claiming control of the railway, have also advanced a demand for the enlargement of the free zone at Salonica by on area of 38,000 square metres. This latter proposal is also one which the Greeks say they cannot possibly entertain.The Serbs are quite clearly in the strongest position 1. Because  they know what they want, i.e., Salonica, or the control of theGhevgeli line as a means to that end. 2. Because they know that, although it is a matter of comparative indifferenceto them, the renewal of the treaty is of paramount importance to Greece. 3. Because there is a suspicion amounting almost to certainty, that they haveItaly behind them. &apos;With regard&quot; to the demand for an extension of the free zone, it is not likely that it was put forward with an idea of its being used as a counter-weight with which to bargain for the control of the railway.

1. The Serbs are determined, sooner or later, to get possession of Salonica 2. As a first step in this direction they have denounced their Treaty of Alliance with Greece, giving as their chief reasons (a.) Dissatisfaction with the Greeks for having signed the GracoBui garian Minorities Protocol (Annex (A) ); aud (6.) The state of the Salonica-Ghevgeli Railway.Their grievance certainly under the latter head and possibly also under the former is a justifiable one.3. Proceedings for a renewal of the treaty were instituted and now have come to deadlock over the question of the control of the railway, the Greeks being unable to contemplate handing over the line to foreign management. Recently a member of the Serbian Ministry for Foreign Affairs told Sir A. Young that : &quot; Should Greece not relinquish control, our relations wTill remain normal, but there will be no treaty.&quot;It might be said that the remedy lay in the hands of the Greeks themselves. It would reasonably appear that, admitting as they do that the traffic on the railway-is in a state of complete chaos, they might well take steps to cut the ground from under the feet of the Serbian complaint by putting their house in order. But even were they capable of undertaking so obvious a duty, it would avail them little at this stage as matters have already gone too far, and in their determination to acquire Salonica the Serbs would in all probability not be long in finding a fresh grievance to take the place of the old. The Serbian wolf is not now in a mood to listen to excuses, however convincing, from the Greek lamb.Finally, there arises the question of how far we ourselves are concerned with the matter. The question of whether we are prepared to view with indifference the eventuality of Salonica becoming a Serbian port (and the corresponding possibility in that event of Dedeagatch falling to Bulgaria) is one which can only be resolved from the point of view of our naval position in the Eastern Mediterranean. Apart from this, we are interested only in respect of the preservation, if humanly possible, of peace in Europe generally and in the Balkans in particular. To this end Sir M. Cheetham was instructed in November last, when the first news of the Serbian denunciation of the treaty reached us, to suggest informally to the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs the advisability of calling in an expert a League nominee if he liked. to reorganise the system on this particular line. The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed his cordial approval of the idea, but with that fatal aptitude for reading hidden meanings into plain statements which is peculiar to the Greek mind, he took this demarche to mean that we were anxious to promote British control over Greek railways in general, and the matter dropped. Previous to this, beyond warning M. Uaclarnanos and M. Veniselos that we considered their views on the prospects of the negotiations then, about to take place as being unduly optimistic, we took no active steps to interfere in a matter which alter all is primarily one of Grasco-Serbian policy, nor, since the failure of the demarche recorded above, have we done so since.Foreign Offi.ce, May 22, 1925.   1 &apos;[g 18323/2690/7]Annex (A).Grceco-Bulgarian Minorities.Origin of the Proposal.1. At the last assembly of the League of Nations held in September 1924 Professor Gilbert Murray proposed that a permanent commission should be established on the spot to watch the minorities situation on the Grasco-Bulgarian frontier. This was agreed upon and a protocol was drawn up and signed by M. Politis and M. Kalkov, representatives respectively of Greece and Bulgaria, and by the secretary-general of the League embodying the arrangements which had been agreed upon.2. Colonel Corfe and Major De Roover, members-of the Grceco-BulgarianMixedEmigration Commission, were appointed members of the new commission as special representatives of the League of Nations.
Present Situation.1. It would now appear that the Greek Government are unwilling to ratify the protocol in view of the attitude adopted by Serbia in respect of the Macedonian minorities.2. Serbia has always contended that the Macedonians are no more Bulgarians than they are Serbians, and that they do not constitute an ethnical minority within the meaning of the minority treaties. In consequence of Greece&apos;s admission, by the signing of the protocol, that her own Macedonians are a Bulgarian minority, Serbia has denounced her Treaty of Alliance with Greece.3. The situation is by no means clear, but it would appear certain that the Serbians have come to some agreement with Italy which leaves them a freer hand in dealing with any problem which may arise between themselves and the Greeks. If, therefore, the Council of the League, at the instance of Colonel Corfe, press Greece to ratify the protocol at this moment it can only increase the tension at present existing, and may lead to a highly dangerous situation which Bulgaria will be the first to exploit.4. In these circumstances it is therefore considered that Greece should not at present be pressed to ratify her minority protocol with Bulgaria, and that in the interests of Balkan peace it would be wiser to shelve the question should it come up at the council meeting now being held at Rome.5 It may be added that, according to information received from our Legation at Athens, Colonel Corfe is distinctly pro-Bulgarian in sympathy, which makes it all the more necessary that the matter should be dealt with at present with the greatest circumspection.E.
