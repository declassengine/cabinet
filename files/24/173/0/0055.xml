The Scottish temporary Act of 1922 expires on July 31st, 1925.      The Bill continues it until 31st March,  1926.2.     So far as &quot;benefits are concerned, the Bill will not &quot;become effective until the amending Scheme for which it provides has &quot;been approved by Parliament.     The Scheme will be so framed aa to bring the Scottish system into as close conformity as possible with the English Bill in its final form.      The Department already possesses some of the necessary powers.     Where additional powers are asked for, the wording of the English Bill has &quot;been adhered to as nearly as may ha.3.     The general financial arrangements proposed represent a continuance of those at present in force, with some minor simplifications, &quot;but a financial resolution may &quot;be required in order to secure the adjustment of one or two small details.4.     As in England and Wales, there is to he no accumulated fund, but a &quot;national&apos; Account is to he kept.5.      It is unlikely that there will &quot;be opposition from any quarter.      In Scotland &quot;both teachers and authorities are in favour of a contributory policy.      It is true that they are also in favour of funding, hut they realise that the English Bill will settle that.6.     Now that the English Bill has &quot;been read a second time it is desirable that the Scottish Bill should also get a second read-ing as soon as convenient.      On the other hand, it would probably be well that the Committee Stage should not &quot;begin until it is clear what concessions, if any, the Government are likely to make in Committee on the English Bill.     These might involve conse-quential amendment of the Scottish Bill., and such amendment could more appropriately he made in the Scottish Grand Committee than at the Report Stage in the House.7.     The Treasury have indicated their general agreement with the terms of the Bill and I would propose to introduce it before the Whitsun Recess subject to such minor adjustments as may be necessary or may he agreed on with the Treasury.J B G .sh Education Department. 1st May,  1925.
