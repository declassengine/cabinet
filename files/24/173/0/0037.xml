[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1   435 Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1925.SECRET. CP 235.(25).CABINET.THE SITUATION IN IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.MY visit to Iraq with the Secretary of State for Air only extended over nineteen days, from the 26th March to the 14th April. Thanks, however, to the wonderful facilities put at our disposal by the Royal Air Force we were able to see the whole of this great country from its Alpine frontier in the mountains of Kurdistan to the Persian Gulf, and this with the equivalent of, at the most, only two whole days taken up in actual travelling. Rather more than half the time was spent in Baghdad, partly in joint conferences with the High Commissioner, the Air Officer Commanding and Iraq Ministers on the defence problem, partly, as far as I was concerned, in a series of interviews and discussions on the general situation with King Faisal, with the members of his Cabinet and other Iraq notables, and with all the prominent British officials in the Iraq service. Similarly, I was able to get into useful touch both with British and Iraqi officials and with a large body of unofficial opinion, Arab, Assyrian, Turkish and Kurdish, at Mosul, Kirkuk, Sulaimanya and Basra, as well as to get interesting glimpses of the work of minor district officers, of the police and of the Royal Air Force, at other places where we made brief landings. I inspected a large number of units of the various forces which combine to maintain the defence of Iraq, as well as hospitals, schools and boy scout parades. I was thus in a position, in spite of the short time at my disposal, to arrive at a sufficiently comprehensive and definite opinion as to the general situation in Iraq.The main principles upon which the British position in Iraq is based were laid down by Mr. Churchill at the Cairo Conference in April 1921 and approved by the Cabinet of the day. They were based, on the political side, on the immediate estab-lishment of an autonomous Iraq State, under its own monarch and with representative institutions, conducting its own affairs, but subject, in return for British support and protection, to the obligation to accept the advice of the British High Commis-sioner on important issues of policy, and assisted both in the departments and in the district administration by a small number of British advisers and administrative inspectors. On the defence side they were based on the substitution for a supreme military command of a supreme Air Force command, the Air Force being treated as the primary instrument of defence and the ground troops as auxiliary. It was part both of the political and military conception embodied in Mr. churchill&apos;s policy that the Iraq Government should build up an army of its own, to be progressively developed to a strength of 15,000 men, a figure which then appeared the minimum necessary to secure the defence of the country, so far as ground troops were concerned, after the withdrawal of all Imperial ground troops.The conclusion to which I have come is that these principles were essentially right, have been developed on sound lines by those concerned to give effect to them on the spot, and have already, both on the political and on the military side, achieved a far greater measure of success than is generally realised.1.: Defence.Taking defence first, the situation in 1922, when Air-Marshal Sir J. Salmond took over the command, was one of very considerable difficulty.  We were still at war with Turkey, and had to envisage the possibility of having to defend Iraq, not only against a direct advance by a Turkish Army from the north-west, but also against a [13074] b
general onset from the Kurdish tribes on our right flank. This defence would have had to be carried out at the end of a slender line of communications some 600 miles from our base at Basra, through a country of which the greater part had been in open insurrection only a year before and had with difficulty been reduced to submission but not disarmed. The most difficult problem of all, under these conditions, was in fact, that of retreat or evacuation. To stay on and hold the whole country was easier and safer than to attempt any withdrawal, whether on Baghdad or Basra, which would have at once invited a Turkish and Kurdish advance and a general rising in our rear. It required in such circumstances no small degree of confidence hAhe capacity of the Air Arm to make the sweeping reductions in military establishments which were immediately put into effect.The situation to-day is very different. Within the country itself the Eoyal Air Force and a keen and efficient Police, coupled with a system of administration under-stood by the people, have established complete order and tranquillity. In one corner of Kurdistan, Sheikh Mahmud, with a free retreat open to him across the Persian border, still manages to harass the villagers and defy, or rather elude, the authorities. Nor can the possibilities of riot arising from some sudden religious or political coffee-house agitation in one of the larger cities, or of local trouble created by shortage of irrigation water or kindred causes of unrest, ever be excluded. But the idea of any general rising against the Government is, in the opinion of all whom I consulted, now almost inconceivable.The external situation, meanwhile, has been hardly less completely transformed by recent events. Turkey is now formally at peace with us, and not in the least likely, whatever the decision of the Council of the League of Nations on the report of the Boundary Commission, to challenge such decision by declaring war against the British Empire. More important still, the alliance with the Kurds, upon which the Turks reckoned, not only for supporters before the Boundary Commission inside Iraq, but for effective military co-operation, has broken down, I think, for good. The Kurdish insurrection may have been temporarily repressed, but the fierce mountaineers have not been permanently cowed, still less conciliated. No Turkish advance in force into Iraq is really feasible as long as it lies in our power to call out the Kurds upon their flank, and to give to a Kurdish rising the munitions, supplies and leadership which the present abortive revolt has lacked. The most troublesome external menace, in fact, to-day comes not from Turkey but from Ibn Saud, a matter with which aeroplanes and armoured cars can deal, if, indeed, it cannot be dealt with even more effectively by a better co-ordination between the various British authorities, who, from their respective positions on the circum-ference of this Arab potentate^ dominions, pursue their several policies towards him.Imperial expenditure upon the defence forces in Iraq has already been reduced from  20,097,684 in 1921-22, to  3,374,700 in the current estimates. The scheme prepared in the Air Ministry, and accepted in general principle by the Cabinet before our visit to Iraq, contemplated further reductions in the Imperial forces during the next few years, part of the substantial saving resulting from these reductions being given as a grant to Iraq in order to accelerate the development of the Iraq army up to  he standard laid down in 1921. As regards the reduction of the Imperial forces, I am now of the opinion that, once the Mosul boundary situation is cleared up, this reduction could proceed even more rapidly than contemplated in the Air Ministry scheme, with a consequent increased saving. I hope shortly, in conjunction with the Secretary of State for Air, to lay a definite programme before the Cabinet.As regards the improvement of the Iraq Army, that part of the scheme which looked to increasing its efficiency by introducing British officers into all executive posts, from company commander upwards, throughout the whole Army, has been somewhat modified in order to bring it into line with the general policy which we are following in Iraq, and to make it clear that what we are aiming at is not to displace the Iraqi officer but only, by a specially intensified training, to help him to command his own men. We have in this way avoided the mistake we made in Egypt where we secured immediate efficiency at the cost of estranging national sentiment, with the result that we can now count neither upon the friendship nor the efficiency of the Egyptian Army once the British officers in it have been withdrawn. Ine question of the future increase of the Iraq Army, whether by the formation of new units or by the absorption of the Iraq Levies, has been temporarily left in abeyance. No increase was contemplated in the Air Ministry scheme for two years, and
financial considerations, in any case, preclude any serious addition to the existing forces within that period.There is, however, another wider consideration which made it preferable to postpone a definite decision on this matter. Experience has proved the supreme efficiency of the Air weapon as an instrument for the maintenance, in a country like Iraq, not only of external defence, but also of internal security. The Air Force has transformed the whole situation in Iraq. It is due to its ceaseless vigilance that the work of political reconstruction has proceeded so smoothly. To ask Iraq, either now or at the end of a few years, to depend entirely upon ground troops would be to invite unnecessary risks and deliberately to substitute a less for a more efficient and economical method of defence. If, therefore, our policy is to withdraw all Imperial forces, air as well as ground units, from Iraq at the end of the present treaty period, it would be only fair to Iraq to begin, at an early date, to make arrangements either for the training and building up of an Iraqi Air Force, or of a mainly British Air Force paid for and raised by Iraq, or for placing certain definite Royal Air Force units at the disposal of the High Commissioner in return for eventual financial assistance by Iraq.But would such a complete evacuation of Iraq really be desirable or even economical from the Imperial point of view? At present Iraq provides the Royal Air Force with a wonderful training ground. I do not think I am trespassing on the field of the Secretary of State for Air if I say that the Air Force in Iraq is for keenness, continuous flying experience under the most varied conditions, and general all-round efficiency, a corps unequalled anywhere in the world. This force occupies a unique strategical position. The great air bases at Hinaidi and Shaiba  commanding, even at present-day air ranges, a great part of Syria, Eastern Anatolia and Western Persia, astride of the main air routes and future railway routes to Persia and India, in the centre of vast plains which render them almost unapproachable in the face of superior air defence constitute, in conjunction with our air bases in Egypt and Palestine, a strategical defensive and striking factor of unsurpassed power and importance which it would be folly to throw away. Vast capital sums have been spent on the permanent equipment of these bases which would be wasted if the Imperial Air Force were wholly withdrawn.I presume therefore that after withdrawing such units of the Air Force as are directly needed elsewhere or which we can afford to reduce altogether, we shall always want to maintain a certain Air Force in Iraq, not for Iraq, but for our own Imperial purposes. The right to do so will clearly be one of the most important points to insist upon in any future treaty with Iraq. If so, the creation of a separate Iraq Air Force, with its own overhead organisation, would hardly be an economical proceeding or one conducive to efficiency. The obvious solution would be to arrange that the extra cost of such work as the Royal Air Force may do for purely Iraq purposes, or of such additional or specially organised units as it may maintain in Iraq for such purposes, should, by some financial adjustment with the Iraq State, cease to be a burden upon the British taxpayer.II. The Political and Economic Situation.On the political side, too, the principles laid down in 1921 have worked out better in practice than could have been expected.    The Iraq Government and administration are not the mere facade or puppet show that it was generally feared that they might prove to be.   The Prime Minister, Yasin Pasha, who commanded a Turkish Army Corps at the age of 33, Sassoon Effendi, the Minister of Finance, and several of their colleagues are men of ability, and have no idea of abdicating the functions of government.   The Iraqi district officers carry out the great bulk of the work of administration, and in travelling round the country I was struck, not only by the real sense of comradeship established between them and the  British administrative inspectors who act as their advisers, but also by the appreciation with which the latter habitually spoke to me of the good sense and competence of their Iraqi colleagues.   I found, indeed, a real co-operation in which each partner contributed something of value to the work of administration.  This was no less true &quot;t headquarters, where Sir Henry Dobbs and the British advisers in the departments ave succeeded in inspiring in the King and his Ministers a genuine confidence in ie sincerity of our purpose in building up the Iraq State, and consequently exercise great influence over the policy and administration of the Government without ifficulty or friction.   The whole machinery of Government, in fact, if not up to [13074] b 2
the highest level of a purely British organised colony, now works smoothly and with very reasonable efficiency with the acceptance and participation of the people of Iraq.   Its creation is an achievement of which we can well afford to be proudMeanwhile, the rather artificial plant of an Iraq national patriotism is gradually taking root, and is being directly fostered through the Army, the schools a flourishing Boy Scout movement, and the press, as well as by general&apos;contentment with the administration. But it is, of course, a thing of yesterday, and is intimately dependent on the British connection which has created Iraq and secures it against external aggression. Moreover, there are many elements in Iraq to whom the Iraq State is, at present at any rate, acceptable mainly or even only because it represents the British connection. The Assyrians, Yezidis and Kurds of the northern frontier, the Turks of Erbil and Kirkuk, and the commercially-minded Arabs of Basra, would sooner be under direct British authority, and could not be governed from Baghdad if the Iraq Government were no longer regarded by them as the medium of British influence and control. Any complete withdrawal of that influence and control in the near future would, in fact, mean the undoing of the creative work of nation building which we have carried so far on such sound lines and with so substantial a measure of success.That not only the security and the administrative efficiency of the Iraq State, but also its internal cohesion, are intimately dependent on the British connection, is fully realised by all the more responsible leaders of the Arab population. The difficulty lies in the less responsible organs of the Press and in the Baghdad coffee-house influences which, as the late Constituent Assembly showed, have such power to sway wholly inexperienced and timid Deputies. These are always liable to manifest themselves in the direction of an exaggerated nationalism, and in a clamour for emancipation from British control or for an aggressive assertion of the Arab as against other racial elements. We have, in our wisdom, insisted on endowing Iraq with the dubious blessing of a complete parliamentary system. The new Parliament is shortly to meet, an event to which no one looks forward with either interest or enthusiasm, and many with profound misgiving. The plain fact is that Iraq is in no sense ready for responsible self-government on Western democratic lines. The general standard of education and political judgment is far too low, and the material for a Parliament competent to direct affairs does not yet exist. However, we must make the best of the situation and hope that it may be possible for Ministers to keep the Assembly down to business and restrain its vagaries. In doing so neither the King nor his Ministers are likely to be troubled by an excessive regard for parliamentarism as such, and it is always possible that, properly kept in order, the Iraq Assembly may prove a useful institution in itself, as well as a step in the gradual education of the public towards such eventual self-government as may be feasible in the East.The financial situation is difficult, but not necessarily discouraging. Iraq revenues cover the cost not only of the whole of the civil administration, including an armed police over 7,000 strong, but of the maintenance of an army of 8,000 men. Revenue is improving, and the Finance Minister reckons that it should improve at at the rate of  150,000 to  200,000 a year during the next few years. This would allow both of improvements in administration and of a progressive increase in Iraq&apos;s share of the responsibility for its defence, if it were not for the wholly impossible burden of Ottoman Debt Annuity imposed on Iraq in pursuance of the Lausanne Treaty (to which Iraq was not a party). The whole situation thus created has been under examination by a Financial Commission appointed by the Colonial Office, and pending receipt of its report I need not go into details under this head. But it is quite clear that some expedient will have to be devised for postponing, at any rate for a few years, full payment of the Debt Annuities.Subject to this condition I see no reason why the finances of Iraq should not be placed on a solvent basis even with the existing economic development of tne country.    For future expansion Iraq depends entirely on two liquids:  oil an water.   If the hopes, on the strength of which the great Turkish Petroleum Group has been organised, prove to be justified, the Iraq revenues ought in another six 0 seven years to be deriving several hundred thousand a year from royalties, wto the indirect benefits to the country and to the revenue from the general expending on opening the oilfields ought to begin to inure in the next two or three ve* . Meanwhile, the new field located and already partially developed by the Ang Persian Oil Company on both sides of the Iraq-Persian frontier near Khani is likely to make its contribution to the general development of Iraq at a nm
earlier date. If this field proves as important as present indications suggest, it may antedate the construction of the proposed pipe-line to the Mediterranean by four or five years, as well as help to give that line a more southerly direction, and justify the choice of an &quot; all-red&quot; route with Haifa as its terminus.If it is to oil that we must look for immediate substantial assistance to Iraq revenues, the real future of the country is bound up now, as for the last 6,000 years, with the proper utilisation of its water supply. There is no inherent reason why the whole of the great alluvial Tigris-Euphrates plain should not be irrigated and closely populated as it has been in the past. The wealth and population which we have created in Egypt in the last fifty years is a small thing compared with what we can create in Iraq in the next fifty. The initial difficulties, indeed, are much greater. Iraq is even more derelict than Egypt was fifty years ago. The rivers of Paradise, rushing along on beds largely raised above the level of the country, are far less docile and controllable than kindly Father Nile. Not only o-reat works for the storage and regulation of their flow7, but extensive drainage schemes for cleansing the soil of salt, will be necessary and will call for large capital expenditure. Population is inadequate, not more than three, or at the most, four millions. But the example of Egypt and the Sudan shows how rapidly an agricultural population will increase under favourable conditions. To natural growth may be added the possibility of immigration from adjoining countries, from the Yemen and possibly also from Egypt. Capital for irrigation works will no doubt be found, once the political future of the country is assured, and once the present large scale experiments in cotton growing justify the high hopes based on the small scale work of the agricultural department during the last few years. Iraq cotton may, indeed, become a very big factor in the country&apos;s development, though it is hardly likely to displace cereals and dates as the great staple crops in their original home.One essential prerequisite to the economic development of Iraq is the improve-ment and extension of its railway system. The port of Basra is admirably equipped and efficiently organised, and the dredging of the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab will in another year or two render it accessible to vessels of 28 feet draft instead of 19 feet as at present. But the railway system is woefully inadequate in equipment, and insufficiently developed. The extension&apos;of the main line from Baghdad through Kirkuk to Mosul, through a rich country dependent on natural rainfall, would enormously increase the traffic of the whole system. Unfortunately, neither development nor even decent maintenance are possible under the present arrangement, under which the British Government owns the railway and has no hope of ever getting anything out of it, while the Iraq Government runs the railway but can raise no money for the improvement of an asset which does not belong to it. Some more business-like arrangement ought to be possible which, without sacrificing the interests of the British taxpayer, should enable progress to be made with the development of the country. Meanwhile, one new form of communication, due entirely to private enterprise and energy, is having a remarkable effect on the whole outlook and orientation of Iraq. I refer to the desert motor service from Beirut  not unlikely, as far as Mr. Nairn&apos;s service is concerned, to be eventually transferred to Jerusalem and Amman as its starting points which is not only bringing an increasing number of travellers to Iraq, or through it on their way to and from India and Persia, but is already beginning to carry a certain amount of light goods traffic. Succeeded as it no doubt will be, sooner or later, especially when the oil pipe-line comes to be laid, by a railway, it marks the first step in the definite linking up of Iraq to the Mediterranean and Western world from which it has been separated not so much by actual distance as by the obstacle of a comparatively narrow- strip of desert. With the building of the railway from the Mediterranean, probably from Haifa, with its eventual extension to Persia, and through Persia to India, and with the inevitable closing up of the gap between Mosul and the Turkish railway system, Baghdad is naturally destined to become the main railway junction of the Middle East. It will no doubt equally become a main air junction with the development of civil aviation.The essential condition of all development is certainty. At present, both the actual frontiers and the political future of Iraq are left in an atmosphere of uncertainty, which militates against tranquillity and good government, and which discourages all capital investment. &apos; As regards the frontier, I cannot believe that the Boundary Commissioners are in the least likely to assign any really substantial part of the Mosul province to Turkey.    What is much more to be feared is an
equivocal or inconclusive report. What is vital, in that case, is that we should press the Council of the League for an immediate decision, in order to put an end to what would otherwise be an intolerable situation.As regards the political future, I have, I hope, made it clear that the principles on which we have worked since 1921 are sound, and that their continuance is essential not only to the development, but to the very existence of Iraq. Originally those principles were to have been embodied in a treaty covering a period of twenty years That was long enough to give reasonable certainty, and the decision of the Cabinet in 1923 to cut down the period to four years from the date of the ratification of peace with Turkey, i.e., to the summer of 1928, was, from that point of view, regrettable. On the other hand, it may be argued that the fixing of a short indeed, an impossibly short date for the cessation of British support has compelled both Iraq Ministers and the British Government to face more determinedly the problem of making Iraq stand on its Own feet, and that the new treaty, the conclusion of which before the end of the four years&apos; period was contemplated in the protocol of the present treaty, can consequently be framed on lines more suited for permanent co-operation, both from the point of view of Iraq and from that of the British Government and British taxpayer.&apos; &apos;Such a new treaty ought not to involve at any rate not after a brief initial period any further British expenditure&apos; on Iraq for Iraq purposes. It ought certainly to reserve to the British Government the right to maintain forces, and that means primarily, and probably exclusively, air forces, in Iraq at whatever strength it may consider desirable on general grounds of Imperial strategy, and to receive some contribution from Iraq for any portion of those forces which may be asked to do purely local Iraq work. It ought to secure a sufficient measure of control to the High Commissioner to enable him to safeguard the interests of Kurdish, Assyrian and other minorities, as well as to ensure that the general administration of public affairs should continue to be such as to afford reasonable protection to foreign commerce and investment. In return, we should naturally include Iraq, as we have included Egypt, as one of those territories which, if not constitutionally part of the British Empire, yet fall within our mrwritten &quot;Monroe doctrine,&quot; and which cannot be attacked without a direct challenge to the whole Empire. Such a treaty, based on mutual Co-operation and mutual advantage, would contain in itself all the conditions of permanence.Great developments and transformations may yet take place in the Middle East in the next generation. The trade and development of Turkey and Persia may have a far greater importance for us than at present. The maintenance of their independence against Russian aggression may once again become an important political interest. In either event, a strong and prosperous Iraq, with a healthy national life of its own, yet closely associated in voluntary union of mutual interest with the British Empire,&apos;may be of great economic and political importance, and may yet represent a substantial return, both material and moral, for our sacrifices inthe past. rT,-Tr1 L.
