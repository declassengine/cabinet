jnmT^DQOUMEMr IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S G OVER MS iff j ,SECRET. Copy Kb.CP, 230  (25) .C A B I NET. Home Affairs Oommlttee, Mer chandj, s eMarlrs ,( Imported Agricultural Produce) Bill. Memora ndxmtjby the Minister jof Agriculture a ma Fisher lea .The attached Bill provides for the marking of certain imported agricultural produce, and is designed to protect not only the British farmer and poultry keeper against unfair competition by virtue of foreign goods being sold as English, but also the consumer against buying foreign goods under the cloak of Englisho     The principle of marking was embodied In a Bill introduced by Sir William Bird in 1923,     The latter Bill was in Committee for 18 days and the Conservative Government of the day decided to take it over as a Government measure generally In the form in which it emerged from Committee, but the Dissolution intervened,A similar Bill was introduced by Admiral Sir Guy Gaunt in 1924, and was generally in the form of the previous Bill as it left Committee.     The Labour Government did not, however, see their way to support Admiral Gaunt&apos;s Bill,Legislation to provide, where practicable, for the marking of imported foodstuffs,- was foreshadowed both in the Prime minister&apos;s Election Address and in the Kingfs Speech at the opening of the present Parliament,The present Bill, which is largely based on Its immediate predecessor of 1924, Is slightly lees comprehensive in that it only deals with (1) fresh, frozen or chilled meat, bacon and ham:  (2) egg3j  (3) cheese; and (4) honey.The method of marking (Clause 1) will vary with the
different commodities, ao that whereas it is possible to prescribe in tho Bill itself how eggs and honey shall be marked, it will be necessary for the marking of meat and oheese to be prescribed by means of Regulations.Clauses 2 and 3 deal with the marking of commodities when exposed for sale in retail shops.Clause 4 deals with the removal or obliteration ofmarks *Clause 5 prescribes that the enforcement of the Bill shall be solely in the hands of the Local Authorities.Clause 6 confers the power of making Regulations.Clause 7 deals with legal proceedings; and Clause 8 contains definitions.     These include &quot;Indication of origin,&quot; which will force the exporter from abroad to indicate either the actual country in which the goods are produced, or otherwise to show whether the goods are exported from the Empire or outside it.     A distinction will therefore be required between Empire and Foreign produce, which should protect the Dominions and Colonies against any Foreign goods being imported as Empire produce.For the purpose of this Bill it is not proposed that any exception shall be made in the case of the Irish Free State, this being regarded in the same category as any other Dominion.Considerable Importance is attached to this Bill by agriculturists and In view of the definite pledges referred to above I hope the Home Affairs Committee will recommend to the Cabinet the introduction of the Bill at an early date and Its passage into law this session,E.F.L.W,Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 7th May, 1925.
