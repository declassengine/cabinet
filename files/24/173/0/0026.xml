9.  The appeal of A.E.E. Reade:    Report of Control Commis sion.10.  Next meeting.11.  Other business..At the last Annual Oongress a representative of the Communist International was present: it is probable that foreign &quot;fraternal&quot; delegates will wish to attend this year.The  importance of this meeting is enhanced by the proposal that foreign fraternal delegates should attend.    This proposal is confirmed by my information, which is to the following effect.      Bertz and Winterich from Germany, both of whom attended the recent meeting of the Enlarged Executive of the Third International at Moscow,  propose to come via Stockholm to Scotland.      The German Communist Party would also like to send Ruth Fischer here, but it is doubtful whether she will attempt it.      Another German Communist, named Stoecker,  is said to have a passport in a forged name and to be ready to come.      Foland and France are also hoping to send representatives.More recent Information is to the effect that some more German Communists with Dr. Friedmann and Rosenfeld propose to attend,   coming on from a Swedish meeting which will be held at Stockholm before the Glasgow Conference.Quite recently,  namely on the 19th ultimo,  there was a meeting at Battersea Town Hall of the Workers International Relief  (a body under Communist influence).      It was presided over at first by the Mayor of Battersea and later by George Lansbury,  M.P.  and there was both here and on the  Continent great expectation of a large number of Communists  coming, though not very many turned up.      Mlsiano of Italy, Albert Fourier of France and some other delegates from Germany and Czechoslovakia    were however here.      An apology was read for the absence of Madame Kameneva from Russia,  who it was stated had been refused a visa by my Department,  and in regard to this a resolution of protest against myself was carried.      A
woman delegate,  Dr.  Polovtseva,  brought a short message of fraternal greetings from the working men and women of Russia;.The attention of my colleagues has doubtless been called to articles in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; to the effect that we are permitting foreign Communists to come to this country,   and the object of this memorandum is to obtain the views of my colleagues as to whether 1  should take action to prevent such persons coming to the Glasgow Conference or not.Quite recently on strong representations from the Foreign Office I reversed previous instructions and permitted eight representatives of the All-Russian Trade Union Council,  viz. M. Tomsky,  G.N. Melnichansky,  Olga F.  Chernichewa,  I.I.  Lepse, N.P.  Glebov-Avilov,  V.M. Mikhailov,  V.Y.   Yarotsky and E.T. Makarova to come here to attend a meeting on the 6th,  7th, and 8th ultimo with the International Sub-Committee of the General Council of the Trade Union Congress.      The object of this gathering (which was in the nature of a return visit),  was to discuss the difficulties arising from the decision of the International Federation of Trades Unions  (the Amsterdam or Second International) in February last on the  subject of the unconditional world Conference on Trades Union Unity which is desired by the Russian Trade Unions and the General Council of the British Trade Union Congress.      This was of course quite a different matter from a Communist Congress and In fact I took the precaution to see Mr.  Arthur Henderson and he expressed the view of his Party that those men coming for a Congress so intimately associated with the Labour Party should be permitted entrance.       (This information is of course highly confidential).The position in regard to the admission to this &quot;country of delegates to the Glasgow Congress is as follows.If the delegate belongs to a country the nationals of which are required to obtain a British visa,  e.g.  the   -U.S.S.R.  and other Eastern European countries or the United States of America,  instructions can be issued to
H.M.  Consular officers to refuse a visa and if nevertheless the alien arrives at a British port,  he will automatically be refused leave to land by the Immigration Officer.      The nationals of most Western European countries are not required to obtain a British visa,  but I have power under Article 1(5)(g) of the Aliens Order to prohibit any alien from landing and instructions can be issued to the Immigration .Officers to refuse leave to any delegates whose names are known beforehand.Apart from these measures every alien is required to satisfy the Immigration Officer at the port of arrival that he is coming on legitimate business and he can be called upon to produce satisfactory evidence to this effect.      If leave to land is given it is open to- the Immigration Officer to impose conditions,  e.g.  as to immediate registration with the Police and length of stay.      Unless some  such special conditions are imposed the alien would not under the present law be required to register with the Police until he had been here for two months.      It is of course possible that an individual alien may evade the Immigration Officer or may get in by giving false information as to the  object of his  journey,  but he would then be liable if found to criminal proceedings under the Aliens Order.      Even if the alien commits no offence against the Aliens Order I have power to deport him,  whether registered or not,  without giving any reasons,   if I deem it to be &quot;conducive to the public good&quot;, and provided of course that  the practical difficulties   (e.g.  in regard to proof of nationality) can be overcome.If the Cabinet should be of opinion that it is undesirable, whatever British Communists may do,  to permit a gathering of foreign Communists and revolutionists to assemble here,   the proper course would be   (l) to instruct H.M.  Consular Officers to refuse  a visa to those Communists from Eastern Europe and elsewhere who are required to obtain it,   and (2)  to instruct Immigration Officers to refuse leave to land to any alien delegates whose names are known beforehand and to any alien who
C6 n ndo /2nd May,  1925.appears on examination to be intending to visit the Con^-gress.Such action would of course be immediately challenged and it would be necessary to state quite frankly that the Government mean    to take all the  steps in their power to prevent alien communists from coming here to foment unrest.I should be myself quite willing to take the responsibility of adopting these steps as Home Secretary,&apos; but I think at least I ought to give my colleagues the opportunity of expressing a contrary opinion if they so desire.V/. J.H.
