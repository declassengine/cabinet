SECRET. CP. 244 (25).CABINET.30DEFENCE  OF  IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. The Cabinet will doubtless wish to have before them ly as possible a report of the results of the tour in the Middle East made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and myself during the Easter Recess in so far as they affect questions of defence. Accordingly I have prepared and circulate herewith a brief resume of the provisional agreement reached with the Government of Iraq as regards the future organisation of defence in that country, and of the circumstances in which it was concluded an agreement which, with Mr. Amery&apos;s concurrence, I desire to commend to the Cabinet for acceptance. The future defence of Palestine is still under discussion between the Colonial Office and the Air Ministry as regards certain points of detail, and I propose to deal with it in a subsequent paper.2. My colleagues will recollect that in a paper circulated in January last (CP. 16/25) I formulated, after discussion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a definite scheme prepared by the Chief of the Air Staff covering a period of six years, the main features of which were (a.) The appointment of a British Inspector-General with a staff of five officers with executive powers to supervise the training and organisation of the Iraq Army.(&amp;.) The immediate introduction of British executive officers into all the units of that Army.(c.) A progressive increase in its strength to a total of 14,500 to be brought about in part by the incorporation in it of the Iraq Levies.(d.) A simultaneous progressive reduction in the strength of the Imperial Forces in Iraq (which were to be withdrawn in toto by 1930-31) and a corresponding diminution in the expenditure which at present falls on the Imperial Exchequer in respect of the defence of Iraq.(e.) A grant-in-aicl of reasonable amount to be paid to the Iraq Government from the Imperial Exchequer as from the inception of the scheme and to continue after the withdrawal of the Imperial Forces so long as the deficiency in Iraq revenues should necessitate.3. These proposals the Cabinet sanctioned in principle on the 3rd February, 1925 (Cabinet 5(25), 7), and a brief outline of them was in due course communicated by Sir Henry Dobbs, the High Commissioner for Iraq, to King Feisal and the Iraq Government.4. On our arrival at Baghdad on the 26th March it immediately became apparent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and myself that it was unlikely that we should be able to obtain the consent of the Iraq Government to the scheme in its original form. Sir Henry Dobbs, whilst professing complete faith in the continued efficacy of air control, which had worked with the most: remarkable success during the past two and a half years, gave emphatic expression to the opinion that it would be impossible to rely solely on ground forces for the maintenance of internal and external security in Iraq, as was projected in the scheme^ and stated that he regarded as absolutely essential the retention of the air arm as the key instrument for securing the continuance of orderly administration. He also informed us that, from conversations he had had Avith King Feisal, he anticipated that objection might be [13072] b &quot;Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1925.
taken to the proposal to introduce British executive officers into all units of the Iraq Army, and warned us that certain other points in the scheme might also prove objectionable to Iraqi susceptibilities. Last, but not least, Commander Hilton Young&apos;s Finance Commission, whom we. consulted, though stating that their review of the situation was not as yet complete, gave it as their considered opinion that the finances of the country would definitely not admit for some years to come of the : Iraq Army being raised to the strength which we had envisaged.5. We were clearly bound to attach great weight to the views of the High Commissioner on these and other points which he raised with us and on which he could speak with unrivalled authority, and no less to the representations of the Finance Commission. Accordingly, we decided to communicate to the Iraq government-ment in writing a modified scheme which corresponded broadly with the proposals put forward by the Air Ministry for the first two of the six &quot;years covered bv the original scheme formulated in CP. 16 (25). The conduct of negotiations on this basis appeared to be not without advantage, since it enabled us to bring our proposals within the compass of the existing military agreement, and obviated any need, for the conclusion of a new formal instrument to replace that agreement, an aspect of the question to which I shall return in a later paragraph in connection with the compromise finally effected.6. There ensued an interchange of notes between the High Commissioner and the Iraqi Prime Minister, amplified by a series of conversations, formal and informal, including an interview between Mr. Amery, myself and Sir Henry Dobbs on the one hand and representative members of the Iraq Government on the other. As a result we were compelled to the conclusion that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain the concurrence of the Iraq Government even to the modified scheme which we had put to them. Thus Sir Henry Dobbs informed us that he took the view that, in the circumstances, to insist on the introduction of British executive officers into all units of the Iraq Army would gravely injure Iraqi national sentiment, which took the. greatest pride in its Army as a symbol of national unity. Indeed, he expressed the fear that unless the scheme was materially modified in this respect the harmonious relations at present subsisting between himself as representative of the British Government and King Feisal might be jeopardised, with the possibility, if not probability, of troublesome reactions on the general political situation.7.&apos; In view of the advice tendered by the High Commissioner, we did not consider the circumstances w^ere such as to warrant the delivery of an ultimatum, a course we should in any case have been extremely reluctant to adopt, owing to the obvious desirability of obtaining the goodwill of the Iraqis to ensure the smooth working of any scheme of military reorganisation it might be decided to adopt. We accordingly set ourselves to devise a compromise which, whilst ensuring that the defence forces of Iraq should be placed on a sound footing -without delay, would be such that, with a little pressure, the Iraq Government might be induced to accept it with good grace, and carry it into execution with good will.8. As a result the following modified proposals were formulated to and, after considerable discussion, accepted by the Iraq Government:  (a.) A British Inspector-General with executive powers to be nominated by theBritish and appointed by the Iraq Governments forthwith. (b.) British executive officers to be introduced as soon as they can be madeavailable into 1 cavalry regiment, 1 pack battery-and 2 infantry battalions of the Iraq Army;* and into a, third infantry battalion early in 1926. (c.) One British Officer instructor with full powders as regards training to be posted forthwith to each of the remaining units of the Iraq Army. (d.) Ten British Officers with executive powers to be introduced into themore important staff and higher training posts in the Ministry of defence and at Headquarters of outside military zones. (e.) A grant-in-aid to be made to the Iraq Government in 1925-26, 1926-27and 1927-28 of Rs. 12 lakhs, 18 lakhs and 18 lakhs respectively. (/.) The foregoing arrangements to be for a period of three years, i.e,, thebalance of the Treaty period which expires in August 1928, but thesituation to be reviewed towards the end of the second year.9. Whilst I do not regard the compromise outlined in paragraph 8 as ideal, and cannot advise my colleagues that it will make the Iraq Army as efficient an* There are at present 6 Iraqi infantry battalions (which number is to be increased during the next few months to 7 or 8), 3 cavalry regiments. 1 field battery and 2 pack batteries (pins 1 howitzer battery unformed).
instrument as I had hoped to create under the original Air Ministry proposals, I regard it as a substantial advance. For example, we had aimed at securing the introduction of sixty-four British officers into the Iraq Army; under the compromise there will be forty-five. From the military point of view, therefore, it may be regarded as not unsatisfactory.Moreover, from the broader political aspect it has certain definite compensatory advantages over the original scheme. In the first place, it carries the consent&apos; of King Feisal and the Iraq Government, and it is obvious that, although we could in the last resort have imposed any terms we chose upon the Iraqis, an arrangement founded upon mutual agreement will be easier to carry expeditiously into effect and is more likely to work smoothly thereafter. In the second place, from the point of view of the political situation at home, there is a still more important advantage to be noted. In the original scheme which I put before the Cabinet I contemplated an extension of the period of military control beyond the three remaining years of the Treaty period. I think that my colleagues will agree that we have now adopted a wiser course in leaving the Treaty and its complementary agreements as they stand and in avoiding any issue with the public, and the press upon the question of a prolongation of our commitments. Further, I take the view that, by leaving the Treaty intact for the present, on its expiry in three years time we shall be in a more favourable position for making a new Treaty, if we so desire, to define our permanent relations with Iraq. We have agreed with the Iraq Government to reconsider the question towards the end of the next two years and to postpone for the present the enforcement of the provisions of the military agreement which require the gradual raising of the strength of the Iraq Army to a figure something- like twice its present numbers by 1927-28. The power of enforcing these provisions during the last year of the Treaty period will give us a useful lever for negotiations, and the fact that Iraq will inevitably continue to need our help, military, political and economic, should enable us to conclude satisfactory arrangements for the future. In the meantime we shall have an opportunity of assessing more accurately the economic resources of the country, e.g., the value of the Mosul oil-fields, and of deciding the extent to which it is desirable to maintain British influence.More important, perhaps, for the moment, the arrangement provides a sufficiently firm basis for calculation to enable me to put forward definite proposals for reductions in the Imperial Garrison.10. My proposals under this head, which have the assent of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, are as follows:  (a.) The withdrawal as soon as the necessary arrangements can be effected of one squadron of the Royal Air Force and one Indian infantry battalion.&apos;* These reductions will leave the garrison at a strength of seven squadrons and three infantry battalions with certain other ground units and ancillaries,(&amp;.) The withdrawal of a second squadron of the Royal Air force so soon as a civil air service can be brought into being to keep open the line of communication by air between egypt^pt and Iraq at present secured by the air mail service operated on a service footing for training purposes between Cairo and Baghdad. This is essential, in order to admit of the rapid passage of reinforcements, should need arise, and until such an organisation exists the second squadron cannot be withdrawn.In the event of an adverse decision by the League of Nations on the question of the Northern frontier, the whole situation, including the strength of the garrison, would, of course, need to be reconsidered.11. In terms of money, when the full effect of these reductions is felt and any residual charges have disappeared, there should be a saving on Middle East Votes under (a) above of approximately  260,000 per annum, and under (6) of a further  175,000, making a total of  435,000 per annum.Needless to say, given a satisfactory settlement of the question of the Northern frontier and an assurance of peaceful relations with Ibn Saud, I anticipate being able to effect progressive and substantial further reductions in the future as the local forces are placed on a sounder footing, but until the British Inspector-General and the executive officers under his command have had time to make their influence felt and we are in a position to judge at what rate, under these altered conditions,* The Indian Government require a year\s notice before the withdrawal of any Indian unit, so that the importance of an early decision will be obvious.[13072] u 2
the Iraq Army is likely to progress, my colleagues will appreciate that I am unable to formulate any definite programme.12. One of the two squadrons of the Royal Air Force to be withdrawn will be brought home and will enable me to effect a slight acceleration in the authorised programme of expansion for Home Defence, which is highly desirable. The other will in all probability be retained in the Middle East in Egypt or the Sudan, thus removing the need for any further depletion of the units at present available in this country, which would otherwise have been unavoidable.13. As regards the inauguration of an air service between Egypt and Iraq, to be operated by a commercial company, this will be a section of a regular weekly service between Egypt and India, as to which I hope shortly to be in a position to formulate definite proposals. From the point of view of imperial communications, this will be a marked advance on the existing service operated by the Royal Air Force for training purposes, inasmuch as (a.) Instead of plying merely between Cairo and Baghdad, it will have anextension to India (Karachi), via Basrah; (&amp;.) It will be weekly, not fortnightly;(c.) It will be freely open to civilian passenger and mail traffic and will not be restricted by military exigencies.As I have already stated, it must be a condition precedent to the withdrawal of the second squadron that this service shall be in operation, but, in any event, I feel sure that my colleagues will agree with me that the opening up of an Imperial air route to India in the early future is of the first importance on political and -commercial, no less than strategic grounds.I shall be glad, therefore, to have the assent in principle of the Cabinet to the institution of this service, subject to my being able to satisfy the Chancellor of the Exchequer as to my detailed proposals, in which connection I may say that I estimate that the subsidy payable to the operating company will be in the neighbour -hood of  75,000- l00,000 per annum, the latter figure being a maximum.14. To summarise, I ask the Cabinet to sanction the following :-(A.) The proposals as regards the organisation of Iraq defence for the next three years outlined in paragraph 8 above;(B.) A consequential reduction in the Imperial Garrison of two squadrons of the Royal Air Force and one Indian Infantry Battalion representing a saving on Middle East votes in a full year of  435,000; the reduction of the second of these two squadrons to be contingent on (C.) The institution of a weekly air service between Egypt and India at an estimated cost of  75,8000- 100,000 per annum.15. In conclusion, I should like to remind the Cabinet of the extent of the savings which the introduction of air control has already enabled us to effect. The comparative figures given in the Appendices speak for themselves : for example, whereas at the opening of the Cairo Conference in March 1921 there were no less than 33 infantry battalions, 6 cavalry regiments and 16 batteries of artillery with 4 squadrons of the Royal Air Force, 4 armoured-car companies and a number of other miscellaneous ground units costing  27,000,000 per annum, the corresponding Imperial garrison at the present time consists of but 8 squadrons of the Royal Air Force, 4 infantry battalions and 3 armoured -car companies costing  4,000,000 per annum. At the same time the country, as the Secretary of State for the Colonies and myself have recently seen for ourselves, is, apart from minor sporadic outbreaks in outlying areas due to Turkish intrigue and other causes which are bound to recur from time to time, in a state of peacefulness hitherto unknown. These reductions are the more remarkable when it is borne in mind that (1.) Three conditions were postulated by the Air Staff when the original programme of gradual withdrawal was first formulated in February 1923, viz. : &quot; (a.) That a satisfactory peace is concluded with Turkey before the 1st April, 1923; and
&quot; (b.) That a stable policy is decided on forthwith to govern ourrelations with Iraq, providing definitely for the continuance of ameasure of British control; and &quot; (c.) That Iraq revenues provide sufficient funds for the maintenance ofan efficient Arab Army or the formation of additional levies, or a combination of these two measures.&quot;f(2.) Peace was not concluded with Turkey until the late summer of 1924 and, despite the lapse of over two years, the second and third of these conditions have not yet been fulfilled.(3.) Simultaneously there has been intermittent trouble in the South-West as a result of raids by followers of Ibn Saud.I cannot imagine a more striking testimony to the efficacy and economy of the air as the key force for exercising control in suitable areas of the Middle East, a subject that opens up a wide vista of future possibilities as to which I have it in mind, with my colleagues&apos; permission, to circulate a separate memorandum in the early future.16. I would, however, end on a note of caution. Five years ago, any proposal to hold Iraq and maintain peace and security from one end of the country to the other even with the present number of squadrons and ancillary ground forces would have been dismissed as outside the realm of practical politics. Indeed in 1922 there was. as my colleagues will recollect, prolonged opposition to the adoption of the scheme of air control. I should be the last to deny that we have been fortunate in that, despite the non-fulfilment of certain fundamental postulates on which the scheme was based, it has hitherto functioned with such complete success. If, therefore, I now recommend further reductions in the Imperial garrison, I do so with the full realisation that we are taking a certain risk; but, having regard on the one hand to the present peaceful condition of the country and on the other to the paramount need for exploring every possible avenue of economy, I take the view  and the Chief of the Air Staff agrees that the risk is a justifiable one and I ask the Cabinet to share with me the responsibility for accepting it.S.
