CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.f This Document is^ the Property of His Britannic Majestyj Government. 1 747GERMANY. CONFIDENTIAL.[May 28, 1925.]Section 1.SO[C 7174/459/18] No. 1.Mr. Austen Chamberlain to the Marquess of Crewe (Paris).(No. 1887.)My Lord, Foreign Office, May 28, 1925.I HAVE received your Lordsbip&apos;s despatch No. 1126 of the 13th May, enclosing the draft of the reply which the French Government propose to send to the proposals for a pact of security made to them by Germany on the 9th February last. The subsequent explanations of this draft reply so. courteously furnished by the French Government through their Ambassador in London at my request have greatly assisted His Majesty&apos;s Government in its examination, and I am now in a position to give their reasoned comments on the document, which they have considered with all the care that the importance of the subject demands.2. It will be convenient to set out first of all the point of view from which His Majesty&apos;s Government have themselves approached the German proposals and the principles by which they have been guided in examining both those proposals and the suggested French reply.3. The point of departure is to be found in the reasoned statement which I made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Council of the League of Nations on the 12th March last, in which the view was expressed that the best way to carry out programme of security, arbitration and disarmament was, with the co-operation of the League of Nations, to supplement the covenant by making special arrangements in order to meet special needs. These arrangements should be purely defensive in character, and should be framed in the spirit of the covenant, working in close harmony with the League and under its guidance.4. Secondly, in my speech in the House of Commons on the 24th March 1 indicated that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government could not accept an extension to every frontier of obligations of the most serious kind, they could properly undertake such obligations in that sphere with which British interests are most closely bound up, namely, the frontier between Germany and her western neighbours.5. The basic principle, then, by which His Majesty&apos;s Government are guided in their approach to the matter now under discussion is, and must be, that any new obligation which they undertake shall be specific and limited to the maintenance of the existing territorial arrangement on the western frontier of Germany. His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to assume fresh obligations elsewhere in addition to those already devolving upon them as signatories of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of the Peace Treaties. At the same time, it may be well to repeat that, in seeking means to strengthen the position in the west, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not themselves question, or give any encouragement to others to question, the Other provisions of the treaties which form the basis of the existing public law of Europe.6. With these preliminary declarations I turn to the French draft. In the first place, His Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to express their appreciation of its conciliatory tone, which is in complete harmony with the spirit that inspires the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The evident desire which it displays to maintain peace and to facilitate the peaceful solution of disputes is a happy augury of the success of the negotiations to which it forms a preliminary.7. The substance of the note, however, goes in certain respects considerably beyond what His Majesty&apos;s Government could for their part endorse consistently with the principles enunciated above. Section IV, for example, contemplates the con-clusion between the signatories of the proposed Rhineland Pact of arbitration treaties which would apply to all disputes of whatever nature,, and would be guaranteed jointly and severally by the signatories of the Rhineland Pact. Section V suggests that the same joint and several guarantee should be given by the same Powers to similar arbitration treaties between Germany and States other than the signatories of the Rhineland Pact.8. I hasten to repeat what I have already said in my statement of the 12th March to the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva, that Plis Majesty&apos;s Government 2394 [13152] b
naturally look with sympathy on any effort to improve the international machinery for maintaining the peace of the world. They therefore welcome any treaties of arbitration or conciliation which the continental Powers concerned may be prepared to enter into, provided only that such treaties do not affect the rights and obligations attaching to membership of the League of Nations under the covenant, But the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government is somewhat different from that of those Powers. In view of the position of the British Empire, with its world-wide responsibilities, His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound to regard the question of participation in treaties of this description from a different point of view to that of Powers whose interests lie mainly or exclusively in Europe. And as regards the proposals for the mainten-ance of peace which are now under discussion, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that, while for the continental Powers concerned the conclusion of the suggested arbitration treaties forms, as is stated in the French draft reply, the natural complement of a Rhineland pact, this is not equally the case with Great Britain.9.For the same reasons, while His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that it would be in the best interests of peace if the Rhinelahd Pact and the various arbitration treaties between Germany and her neighbours were to come into force simultaneouslv, yet they cannot support the proposal made in section VI of the French draft that all such arbitration treaties and the Rhineland Pact should form an indivisible whole and be co-ordinated in one general convention.10. Nevertheless, though His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to go so far as the French Government suggest, yet they are prepared in principle (and, of course, subject to a careful examination of the actual terms ultimately proposed) to give a guarantee, flowing logically from the territorial guarantee of the Rhinelaud, of arbitration treaties which may be concluded between Germany and her western neighbours, signatories of the pact. The type of guarantee which they have in mind would operate in the event of a failure on the part of one of the parties to refer a dispute to arbitration (using the term in its widest sense to cover both judicial awards and conciliation tribunals) or to carry out an award, if such failure were coupled with a resort to hostilities. The guarantee would be, so to speak, defensive; it would not entail upon His Majesty&apos;s Government as they conceive it any obligation to resort to force elsewhere than in the areas covered by the proposed Rhineland Pact; and would not operate in any event in favour of the party which Lad refused arbitration or had refused to give effect to an arbitral award.11. It is clear from the four preceding paragraphs that the French draft as it stands cannot be accepted as accurately conveying the extent and character of the obligations which His Majesty&apos;s Government are ready to assume and that its terms require amendment if they are to express not merely the views of the French Government but, as the French Government suggest, the common policy of the Allies.12. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not desire to suggest that the form of the note should be changed so as to make it clear that it commits the French Government alone to the views and proposals which it contains. Rather, recognising to the full the great value and importance of an agreed statement of views common to the Allied Powers, they would strongly recommend that an effort be made so to amend the draft as to achieve agreement.13. With that object in view, His Majesty&apos;s Government have ventured to remodel the French draft in such a way as to confine it to such a statement of policy as they believe is common to both countries and thus to avoid raising particular points of principle in which this country cannot ab initio concur. A copy of this recast draft is enclosed (printed side by side, for convenience, with a translation of the original French draft), and, in communicating it to M. Briand, I reqtiest that your Lordship will lay emphasis on the fact that my object has been to produce a statement of general principles without in any way committing either His Majesty&apos;s Government or their allies to exact phraseology or to particular proposals whose exact shape can only be determined when the time is reached for considering a draft instrument to give effect to these general objects.14. Having said so much as regards underlying principles, it only remains to deal in detail with the French draft paragraph by paragraph, explaining where necessary the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government and giving the reasons for such alterations in the original draft as are now submitted to the French Government.15. The &quot;preamble and the first three sections of the French draft remain unaltered in the revised version. But while accepting them as they stand, His MajestyV Government feel bound to point out that they are couched in terms so wide that His Majesty&apos;s Government must reserve their liberty to define more precisely at
the proper time the interpretation which is to be placed upon them. This of course necessarily applies to the whole document; with this general reserve, His Majesty&apos;s Government only desire to make two specific remarks concerning the first three.sections. .    .     &apos; &quot; : , -16. First, it is understood that the effect of section I is that Germany&apos;s entry into the League is an essential but not a prior condition of the agreement contemplated. The agreement would, however, be so framed that it would only become operative on Germany joining the League.1 7. Secondly, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire specifically to endorse the observa-tion in section III that Belgium ought to be a party to the pact as a State directly interested. Without her inclusion the proposed pact would obviously be incomplete. This is so self-evident that the omission of Belgium&apos;s name from the German proposals can only have been due to an oversight, as, indeed, the German Government have since explained. ;18. In section IV the first paragraph of the original French draft, remains unaltered, it being simply a summary of a portion of the German proposals themselves.. The broad reasons for the amendments made in the remainder of the section will be apparent from the exposition of principles contained in the earlier part of this despatch. The second paragraph has been considerably modified and amplified. In the first place, as it reads in the revised version, it refers only to a possible Franco-German arbitration treaty, thus leaving the other Allies free to decide whether or not to conclude a similar arbitration treaty with Germany. At the same time, the hope is expressed that Belgium will be disposed to enter into a similar treaty. If, as His Majesty&apos;s Government feel should be the case, the draft is... submitted to the Belgian Government before despatch and is subsequently sent with the approval of that Government, it will no doubt be possible to redraft the phrase regarding Belgium in a more positive sense. . -19. Next, the latter half of the second sentence in the second paragraph of the same section has been redrafted in such a way as to make clear the meaning which, according to the explanations offered to me, the French Government attached to it.20. Thirdly, in place of the third sentence of the second paragraph a new paragraph is added retaining the idea of a guarantee of an arbitration treaty, and making clear the implication of such a guarantee.21. The alterations made in section V are two in number. In the first place, the words in the second paragraph &quot; the object of the pact could not be attained&quot; have been omitted because it was felt that they were unnecessarily pessimistic. The idea which the words were presumably intended to convey has been retained, however, by the insertion of words to show that while the Rhineland Pact is an essential step towards the attainment of European peace, that peace cannot be completely guaranteed if the Rhineland Pact remains unsupported by other regional settlements.22. The second alteration in this section consists in the omission of the final paragraph of the original draft. The paragraph provided for the guarantee by the signatories of the Rhineland Pact of arbitration treaties between Germany and her other neighbours. This, for reasons already explained in this despatch, is unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government.23. A new section has been inserted at this point, numbered VI. Its only object rs, by a clear statement, to prevent misunderstanding. There can, of course, be no question that it expresses a view on which the Allied Governments are unanimously agreed.24. Section VII is based on the original section VI in the French draft. The first two paragraphs of the latter section were in contradiction with the principle of limited obligations which His Majesty&apos;s Government have adopted, and were therefore unacceptable. They have been replaced by the first paragraph of section VII which expresses the view that the various agreements in contemplation, whether relating to the Rhineland or to the other frontiers of Germany, should come into force simultaneously.25. The rest of the original section VI is reproduced in section VII, with only one alteration, viz., in the last paragraph the phrase &quot; French Government &quot; has been substituted for &quot; Allied Governments&quot; as being more in accordance with the form. [Of a note which is to be sent to Germany by France alone, but in agreement with the Allies. &quot;... ...-6.^ His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly hope that the French Government will [see their way to accept the modifications proposed above. It is, of course, far from I being  their  intention. to suggest that  the French  Government  should  renounce .
those ideas in their original draft, which His Majesty&apos;s Government have been unable to accept, and ah acceptance of the modified draft would not be construed by His Majesty&apos;s Government as a renunciation by the French Govern-ment of those ideas. His Majesty&apos;s Government are solely actuated by the consideration that it would be of great advantage if at this stage a note were sent to Germany setting out the basic principles on which the Allies are in agreement. They urge this course because they believe that&apos; it will serve a more useful purpose than the despatch of separate notes which, while having the advantage of showing the maximum limit to which each Allied Power was prepared to go, would have the disadvantage of laying undue emphasis on such divergence of views as may exist between the Allies. - . .27 I request that, in communicating to M.

Enclosure in No. 1.Draft Reply to the German Memorandum.AS they have informed the German Government in their note of the 20th February last, the French Government have studied, in common with their allies, the suggestions contained in the memo-randum forwarded to them on the Uth February by his Excellency M. von Hoesch.The French Government and their allies regard the step taken by the German Government as an earnest of pacific inten-tions which agree with their own.Wishing to give to all the States concerned supplementary guarantees of security within the framework of the Treaty of A^ersailles, they have examined the German proposals with all the attention that they merit in order to judge what elements they may afford for the consoli-dation of peace.Before embarking, however, on an ex-amination in detail of the German note, it has appeared desirable to set out clearly the questions which it raises, or may raise, and on which it is important to know the views of the German Government because a preliminary agreement concerning them appears to be the necessary basis for any future negotiations : I.The memorandum only mentions inci-dentally the League of Nations.Now the Allied States are members of the League of Nations and are bound by the Covenant of the League, which involves for them clearly defined rights and obliga-tions with the object of maintaining general peace.The German proposals no doubt lay claim to the same ideal, but no agree-ment could be achieved unless Germany on her side assumes the obligations and enjoys the rights laid down in the covenant of the League.This agreement, then, can only be con-ceived if Germany herself enters the League of Nations under the conditions laid down in the note from the Council of the League of Nations dated the 13th March, 1925.II.The search for the guarantees of security which the world demands cannot involve any modification of the peace treaties.[13152]Suggested Alternative Draft.[N.B. The passages whioh differ from the French drafr, are printed in italics.]AS they have informed the German Government in their note of the 20th February last, the French Government have studied, in common with their allies, the suggestions contained in the memo-ranclum forwarded to them on the 9th February by his Excellency M. von Hoesch.The French Government and their allies regard the step taken by the German Government as an earnest of pacific iuten-tions which agree with their own.Wishing to give to all the States eon-cerned supplementary guarantees of se-curity within the framework of the Treaty of Versailles, they have examined the German proposals with all the attention that they merit in order to judge what elements they may afford for the cotisolida-tion of peace.Before embarking, however, on an examination in detail of the German note, it has appeared desirable to set out clearly the questions which it raises, or may raise, and on which it is important to know the views of the German Government because a preliminary agreement concerning them appears to be the necessary basis for any future negotiations :  I.The memorandum only mentions in-cidentally the League of Nations.Now the Allied States are members of the League of Nations and are bound by the Covenant of the League, which involves for them clearly defined rights and obligations with the object of main-taining general peace.The German proposals no doubt lay claim to the same ideal, but no agreement could be achieved unless Germany on her side assumes the obligations and enjoys the rights laid down in the Covenant of the League.This agreement, then, can only be con-ceivecl. if Germany herself enters the League of Nations under the conditions laid down in the note from the Council of the League of Nations dated the 13th March, 1925.II.-The  search   for   the   guarantees   of .security which the world demands cannot involve an3&apos;  modification of  the  peace treaties.c
The agreements to he concluded ought not, therefore, either to imply a revision of these treaties or to result in practice in the modification of the conditions laid down for the application of certain of their clauses.Thus the Allies cannot in any case give up the right to oppose any failure to observe the stipulations of these treaties, even if the stipulations in question do not directly concern them.III.The memorandum of the 9th February contemplates first of all the conclusion between the &quot; Powers interested in the Rhine &quot; of a pact which might be inspired by the following principles : 1. Repudiation of all idea of war between the contracting States.2. Strict respect for the existing territorial situation in the Rhineland, with a joint and several guarantee by the contracting States.3. A guarantee by the contracting States of the execution of the obligations concerning the demilitarisation of the Rhineland -which Germany has under-taken under articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles.The French Government do not fail to appreciate the value to the cause of peace, side by side with a renewed affirmation of the principles inscribed in the Treaty [of Versailles], of a solemn repudiation of all idea of war (an undertaking which, more-over, ought not to contain any time-limit) between the contracting States.Those States must clearly include Belgium, who is not expressly named in the German memorandum and who ought to be a party to the pact as a State directly interested.It also goes without saying, and further results from the silence on this point of the German memorandum, that the pact to be concluded on these lines could not affect the provisions of the treaty relative to the occupation of the Rhineland, nor the execution of the conditions laid down in relation thereto in the Rhineland Agree-ment.IV.The German Government next declare themselves prepared to conclude with France and with the other States, parties to the Rhineland pact, arbitration treaties guaranteeing &quot; a peaceful settlement of juridical and political conflicts.&quot;The agreements to be concluded ought not, therefore, either to imply a revision of these treaties or to result io practice in the modification of the conditions laid down for the application of certain of their clauses.Thus the Allies cannot in any case give up the right to oppose  any failure to observe the stipulations of these treaties even if the stipulations in question do not directly concern them.III.The memorandum of the 9th February contemplates first of all the conclusion between the &quot; Powers interested in the Rhine &quot; of a pact which might be inspired by the following principles : 1. Repudiation of all idea of: war between the contracting States.2. Strict respect for the existing terri-torial situation in the Rhineland, with a joint and several guarantee by the contracting States.3. A guarantee by the contracting States of the execution of the obliga-tions concerning the demilitarisation of the Rhineland which Germany has undertaken under articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles.The French Government do not fail to appreciate the value to the cause of peace, side by side with a renewed affirmation of the principles inscribed in the Treaty [of Versailles], of a solemn repudiation of all idea of war (an undertaking which, more-over, ought not to contain any time-limit) between the contracting States.Those States must clearly include Bel-belgium, who is not expressly named in the German memorandum and. who ought to be a party to the pact as a State directly interested.It also goes without saying, and further results from the silence on this point of the German memorandum, that the pact to be concluded on these lines could not affect the provisions of the treaty relative to the occupation of the Rhineland, nor the execution of the conditions laid down in relation thereto in the Rhineland Agree-ment.IV.The German Government next declare themselves prepared to conclude with France and with the other States parties to the Rhineland Pact arbitration treaties guaranteeing &quot; a peaceful settlement of juridical and political conflicts.&quot;
France considers that such arbitration treaties would be the natural complement of a Rhineland pact. But it must be understood that they should apply to all disputes of whatever nature, and should not leave room for coercive action save in case of failure to observe the provisions of the various treaties and agreements con-templated in the present note. To give full effect to these treaties their observance ought to be assured by the joint and several guarantee of the Powers who participate in the territorial guarantee contained in the Rhineland pact.V.In their memorandum the German Government added that they were ready to conclude with all States who were so disposed arbitration treaties of the same kind.The Allied Governments note this assurance with satisfaction. They even consider that, in the absence of such agreements between Germany and those of her neighbours who, without being-parties to the suggested Rhineland pact, are signatories of the Treaty of Versailles, the object aimed at by the pact could not be attained nor the peace of Europe com-pletely guaranteed.The Allied States, in fact, have, under the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Treaties of Peace, rights which they cannot possibly give up and obliga-tions of which they cannot possibly divest themselves.The arbitration treaties thus conceived would have the same scope as those contemplated in paragraph IV and would be backed by the same joint and several guarantee.VI.In the opinion of the French Govern-meut the general guarantee of security necessary for the maintenance of peace cannot be eifectively assured unless the agreements contemplated in the present note form an indivisible whole.France considers that an arbitration treaty of the hind proposed would be the natural ^complement of a Rhineland pact. But it must be understood that as between herself and Germany it would apply to all disputes of whatever nature and should not leave room for coercive action save where such action may be taken consistently with the provisions of treaties in force between the -parties. It is hoped that the Belgian Government will be disposed to enter into a similar treaty.To give full effect to these two treaties their observance ought to be assured by the joint and several guarantee of the Powers which participate in the territorial guarantee contained in the Rhineland pact, so as to ensure that any failure to refer a dispute to arbitration or to carry out an award would, if coupled with a resort to hostilities, bring the guarantee into immediate operation. In the absence of a resort to hostilities, the Council of the League shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect to the treaty.... &apos;  V. &apos;In their memorandum the German Government added that they were ready to conclude with all States who were so disposed arbitration treaties of the same kind.The Allied Governments note this assurance with satisfaction. They even consider that, in the absence of such agreements between Germany and those of her neighbours who, without being parties to the suggested Rhineland pact, are signatories of the Treaty of Versailles, the peace of Europe, towards -which the pact is an essential step, could not be completely guaranteed.The Allied States, in fact, have, under the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Treaties of Peace, rights which thej&apos; cannot possibly give up and obliga-tions of which thej7 cannot possibly divest themselves.VI.Nothing in the treaties contemplated in the present note would affect the rights and obligations attaching to membership of the League of Nations under the covenant.
They consider therefore that all the agreements, the observance of which should in each case be guaranteed by the signature of the same Powers, ought to be co-ordinated in a general convention registered by the League of Nations, placed under the auspices of the League and capable of forming, as suggested in the German memorandum itself, the nucleus of a still more general pacific entente.Finally, it goes without saying that if the United States were to find it possible to associate themselves with the agree-ments which would thus be realised, France would be only too happy to see the great American nation participate in this work of general peace and security.Such are the principal points on which it has appeared necessary to obtain precise knowledge of the views of the German Government.The Allied Governments would be glad to receive a reply on this subject which will permit the opening of negotiations with the object of concluding agreements which will constitute a new and effective guarantee of peace.Finally, it goes without saying that, if the United States were to find it possible to associate themselves with the agree-ments which would thus be realised, France would be only too happy to see the great American nation participate in this work of general peace and security.Such are the principal points on which it has appeared necessarj7 to obtain precise knowledge of the views of the German Government.The French Government would be glad to receive a reply on this subject which will permit the opening of negotiations with the object of concluding agreements which will constitute a new and effective guarantee of peace.May 12, 1925.The general guarantee of security neces-sary for the maintenance of peace cannot be completely ensured unless all the agree-ments aimed at in the presentniite conicinto force simultaneously.
