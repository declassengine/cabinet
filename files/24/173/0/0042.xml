ENGINEERING - GENERAL TRADE.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR said that the Sheffield steel and tool trade was in a very unsatisfactory condition, being down by some 12 to 15f! in the first quarter of the year. Orders were not coining in well.    Rolling Mills and Forges were badly off, and one or two such concerns had gone into liquidation.    The seriousness of this night be gauged from the fact that, if trade were normal, there would not be enough rolling mills in Sheffield to meet the demand.It had been hoped that the high United States Tariff on tungsten and other high speed steel would lead to a rise in the domestic price in that country;  so far this had not taken place, but it seemed likely that a rise might come about in the near future.In France and Italy our trade was at a standstill; though business was fair with New Zealand and South Africa. The home trade generally was keeping up   as well as any section.    In China, trade was beginning to be held up through the political disturbances, which led to goods not being moved up country: were it not for this, China1s trade would probably be good.    In this connection he read some extracts from a letter received from a correspondent travelling in China, as follows:-&quot;Native metal merchants dare not move their cargo &quot;either from up-country to the ports or vice-versa: &quot;no one will think of engaging in industry when at any &quot;moment either his goods or his factory are liable to &quot;be seized by bandits calling themselves Government &quot;troops.&quot;&quot;The Railways are in the worst state they have been in &quot;since they were opened to traffic and their revenues-&quot;instead of being applied to Liaintenance and Construction &quot;are seized and wasted by &apos;fighting? forces whose worst &quot;blow is given by a bad dollar.&quot;&quot;It being useless to criticise unless one is prepared &quot;to suggest a   ;remedy, I would suggest that in my &quot;opinion,  China should be treated as a second Persia: &quot;called on to meet her obligations: found wanting, and &quot;dealt with by the creditor Powers.    Unbelievable as it &quot;may sound, no-one would be more pleased than the &quot;average Chinese who would at once find work and wages, &quot;where he is at present finding floods and famine. &quot;Unless the Powers are prepared to see their Nationals &quot;killed and disgraced, their securities in the shape of &quot;Railways,  etc., made valueless and their prestige &quot;utterly gone, it will come to something on the lines &quot;suggested eventually, and the greater the delay,  the &quot;greater the loss.&quot;From the above, you will have gathered that we &quot;are going through very difficult times&quot;.In reply to a question by the President Sir Arthur Balfour said that he&apos;would attribute the present position of the industry to stagnation of orders arising from too high prices, and not to increased foreign competition.    Buyers w*ere
4/r* o 0 engineering - GENERAL TRADE (contd. ).inclined to anticipate a drop in prices, and consequently would not buy freely, remembering the heavy writings-off of 1901.Mond Scheme.With regard to the Mond Scheme and other similar schemes designed to use the unemployment relief as a subsidy to industry, he had not been able to see a way over two objections, namely:-(1) That any scheme would not be tolerated which meant that firms in general, and,  to his own particular knowledge, in Sheffield, would again have their accounts made subject to control, as.in the case of the Excess Profits Duty:(2) Some firms are more efficient than others, and are now doing a reasonable trade and employing as many men as in 191 [V.    If their less efficient competitors . were subsidised,  they would be enabled to compete for the same orders, with the result that the general employment position would not be improved, though harm would be done to the more efficient firms.It was sometimes said that such schemes as these should only apply to &quot;new business&quot;, but how should &quot;new business&quot; be defined?The President said that a scheme might conceivably be framed which would enable some external trade to be secured,&apos; which would otherwise not come to this country.    Sir Arthur Balfour replied that some such particular applications of the scheme might perhaps be practicable,  but a general application of it would be extremely difficult.Credits for Russia.He would also refer to the question of credits for Russia;  in regard to this,  a position was now developing in which credits granted by exporters to Russia were mounting up to a large total, whereas at first they had always tried to secure cash payments.    This Tfillingtiess to give credit arose largely from firms&apos; desire to increase their output, and proportionately diminish their overhead charges.    The credit being given &quot;was generally on such terms as one-third payable with the order,  one-third at three months and one-third at six months.    In some cases credit was being given for as much as twelve months.    This poeition,  as he had said, was extending and mounting up, and it seemed to need consideration by the trading community - though he could understand that the Government would not desire to interfere to stop firms taking business on terms which they consider worth taking.
Tne Mond Scheme.Referring to the Liond Scheme, the President said he had found a general consonsus of opinion that, in the coal trade the only        jj effect of applying any general scheme of the kind would bo to &apos;   ) &quot; enable some pits, which could now hardly keep going, to Btart afresh; but, unless increased consumption of coal could be secured., this would only throw men cut of employment at other more efficient pits; so that the Government would have to pay twice over, both in the form of the subsidy and also in unemployment relief to the men thrown out of work, without increasing economic production at all.A3 regards shipbuilding also, a shipbuilder v/ith whom he had discussed the question had observed that unless some form of scheme could be devised which would not merely result in a transfer of work from one concern to another, it would be dangerous.Sir Adam Nimmo said that,  in the case of the coal trade the       J application of such a scheme would only mean keeping a number of      i marginal collieries going, and throwing large quantities of un-        j wanted coal on the market,  thus making the position worse.    In short, it would not work in the coal trade.    Sir Alan Anderson remarked that there was the further objection that it would encourage methods not Btrictly competitive, and induce firms to continue doing things they could not really afford to do.IRON AND STEEL. I -iI\!R. BARER said his impression was that the outlook in the iron and steel industry was worse than a month ago.   He was sur-prised at the higher figure of output, which he could not account for.   The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation had received reports that the Scottish sheet trade was bad, but thore was some sli^rt improvement in the rivet, nut and bolt trade.&apos;   In Wales one large works had closed down and another was on half time, but a third was restarting; five tin-plate and four sheet mills were idle, and in addition many works were on short time and working intermittently.During the quarter ended &quot;1st March there was an average of 169 furnaces in blast out Of a total of 466 in Great Britain as compared with 171, the average for the previous quarter.    The reports from all districts were that buying of pig iron was dull and stocks wero accunulating where production continued.    During the faster holidays, many firms who had ordinarily cloned down only for the week-end, closed for a week or 10 days on this occasion. The North of England sliding scale audit showed that prices had again fallen and there would be a reduction of 1-J;&apos; in workmen &apos;s wages - the third such reduction in succession - bringing the acsde down to 4-0 above the base rate.He feared that the iron and steel trades were being adversely influenced by the efforts to get back to pre-war parity.   The whole tendency of    such efforts was to enable us to purchase cheapor abroad but of course it also enabled our French and German competitors to send material here more cheaply.ENGINEERING - GENERAL TRADE (oontd.).The President observed that in the case of comparatively . short-tern credits, such as for six months, there would probably be a good deal less   risk than if, for example, Export Credits were utilised, since the Russians would not want to default on their short term obligations, as this would lead to an immediate stoppage of all oredit.Proceeding, Sir Arthur Balfour said there had been no defaults so far.    The credits in question had been given to Arcos and Centrosoyus in London,
4 i itIRON AND STEEL.MR. ARTHUR DORMAN (by letter):-&quot;There is no change to report In the Heavy Steel Tradoj many plants are running on short time, and there is a great dearth of Orders.&quot;The production of Iron and Steel In tho Month of Maroh shows an increase over February.    This, however, is due to the longer month, the output of Iron being 607,900 tons and of stool 684,700 tons, the February figures being 534,100 tons and 646,400 tons respectively.&quot;There has again bsen an Increase in tho Imports, the March tonnage being 244,900 tons as against 234,900 tons in February.    The monthly average in 1913 was 197,699 tons.&quot;in Maroh the Exports wore inoreaaed to 312,200 tons against 298,800 tons in February, compared with a monthly averago in 1913 of 414,102 tons.&quot;The Galvanised and Blaok Shoot Trade still remains quiet, there being little demand at the moment, and orders are not easy to procure.&quot;So far as the Wire Trade is concerned, tho situation is growing steadily more and more unfavourable, and the present conditions are worse than they have been known for fully 15 years.    This is due to the large number of Collieries at present having to close down through shortagG of orders, and therefore not requiring wire products, also from the very severe competition whioh is being encountered from abroad, particularly from Belgium and Germany, In both the Home and Export trade.    The importation of wire and wire rods into this country is increasing, and this is oauaing unemployment in the wire trades.&quot;Prioes of Continental semi-finished products aro lower, and the quantity of these products whioh is being Imported is also Increasing.&quot;Workmen are working well, but owing to short time, costs are considerably higher than they would otherwise be. If we are to hold our own in the World&apos;8 markets we must gat more Orders and we must get relief in some of the Items of cost outside the control of our industry, chief among them being Railway Rates&quot;.COAL.SIR ADAM NIMMO said he could not report any marked change in EEioondTt1on of the Coal industry as compared with last monthf output was,  broadly, about 10&apos;fe less than in 1924.    The figures circulated (see statistical Data at end) showed a much bigger reduction for the week ended 18th April, but this was affected by the Easter holidays.    Expert was about !5:/a less than in 1924: this was the most serlcus aspect of the trade at the prosont time? the home demand remained fairly steady, but tho big falling off was for export j the exporting areas were experiencing great difficulties at present.Prices were -falling   all round,  including inland prices; gas-works contracts,  for exampla, were now being made at 5/- a ton less than a year ago*
CONFIDENTIAL.. COAL  (CONTD.).In consequence, an acute crisis was developing as to the ability of the industry to support existing wages and labour conditions j these wot?e being carefully explored by the two sides of the industry.    Unemployment seemed to be on the increase, and, though figures were not yet available, it was probably worse in April than in March.    March had shown an Increase of between 9&quot;/o and 10fo as compared with the corresponding month a year ago.The industry was very badly situated, and It was hard to see a way out.    Reconstruction in many directions would, he thought, be neoessary before we oould get back to a sound position.    In this connection, the fortunes&apos;of the coal trade were very much bound up with those of its dependent industries, which also were In a bad way.    Till the latter oould improve their position and expand their export trade, the ooal industry Itself could not be re-established on a sound basis.    Every industry ought to get back on to a sound competitive footing.ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING-.MR., ^HIRST said that the electrical industry was fairly satisfactory, and reasonably well occupied.    It was true they were suffering in the industrial departments which rely on coal, shipbuilding, etc.; but the bigger electrical manufaoturihg firms had been able to find new developments, with the result that employment in the industry generally, was not falling off.With regard to Sir Alfred Mond&apos;s subsidy proposals, It should be mentioned that the costs of various firms In the oieotrical industry had been investigated by Independent auditors, who had found that there was a difference of as much as 25/o between the production coats of different firms.    In these circumstances it seemed almost impossible to subsidise firms whose situation varied so widely.During his recent visit abroad he had been surprised to note the extent of the development of water power in France, Italy and Germany; and he wondered if the coal industry had any idea as to how this rapid development would be likely to affect them.    It would, no doubt, be a permanent feature in the future.Orders continued to come forward much as before: there was no great boom, but a 3teady influx of orders was maintained *-mainly for the home trade; the overseas trade generally was-still bad, but business with India was better than It had besn.SHIPPING.SIR ALAH ANDERSON said that the shipping industry&apos;s outlook was gloomy; freights were lower than last year.    He handed in certain charts, which showed that they had been practically back to the pre-v/ar freight level for the last 3 or 4 years. Laid-up tonnage had, however, decreased somewhat while freight rates were still falling.    This was a new development, and seemed to indicate that running costs were on the decline: tho market rate for charters was also down; so that it was evidently possible to employ ships at a cheaper rate than before.   Laid-up tonnage had declined by about 13,000 tons as compared with this time last year,  but this was not sufficiently large to be regarded as a material change.
CONFIDENTIAL. SHIPPING (OONTD).As regards tonnage undor construction, the foreigners had improved their relative position as compared with us, but this was bound to be the oase for a short while,-since more tonnage had been commenced abroad last year than In previous years nevertheless, we launched last year more than the rest of the world, and at the same time commenced as much as the rest of the world.   At the moment, however, foreign competitors wars able to take orders away from usj our costs were not yet right.With regard to thoMond Scheme, he found himself In agreement with Sir Arthur Balfour.   The Chamber of Shipping had not yet debated the proposals, but would no doubt take the same view as they had taken in regard to Government credits to assist shipbuilding, namely, that such measures were not merely a dope but a podson.TEXTILES. COTTON.MR. JUDSON said that the position of the Cotton trade, if it had&apos; changed&apos;at all, was rather worse*   The Amerioan section was working organised short time, while the Egyptian section found itself worse situated than for several years past.    It was not working organised short time, but spindles were being stopped for want of orders 5 this was to be attributed to the high price of Egyptian cotton, of whioh the better grades had been up to more than 3/- a lb.Three or four months ago the trade was prosperous, and It appeared on stocktaking that good profits were then made but they only went to wipe off debt, and In very few oases had dividends b*en paid.He considered that Press reports to the effect that Italy would be able to oust us from the Indian market were a fallacy, on account of the relatively small number of spindles in Italy, whioh had been put at 4-g- million; these would not, he thought, suffioe to meet even their own home consumption.   Colonel Willey, however, was inolined to think that the number of spindles there was considerably more than this.Mr. Judson added that he did not see any Immediate prospect of a change in the situation of the industry.SIR W. CLARE LEES  (by letter):-&apos;&quot;The past month has been one of comparative Inaction in the Overseas Markets so far as the cotton trade Is concerned.&quot;Machinery is still engaged at about the same proportion as a month ago but I should say that the tendency is for order books to be running off, as orders for Piece Goods in the finished state have not been coming in as fast as the production has been going out&quot;o
TEXTILES: COTTON  (OpntdQ.COLONEL BSDDON BROWN endorsed Mr, Judson&apos;s remarks; the trade was not as&apos; good&quot; as It had been.    Ths* price of Egyptian Ootton was such that spinners and manufacturers would not purchase, and were waiting for the new crop.    The supply of Sakel Cotton was very short, but purchasers were hoping for a good new cropland were therefore holding off.    It was to be feared, however, that the new crop of Sakel would suffer from the condition Into which the growers had allowed their seed to get.The question of Import licences in Germany was a serious one; some large users of English cloths in Germany were becoming disheartened and would not apply for licences or ask us for quotations.    German manufacturers were using all their Influence to stop tho granting of licences, even though they could not produce the oloths themselves; merchants, on the other hand, were very keen on getting them, and a resolution on the subject had been passed by the Bielefeld Chamber of Commerce! Colonel Seddon Brown promised to supply a copy of this.He also referred to rumours of a secret arrangement entered Into with Gzeoho-Slovakla, to let a large amount of cloth into Germany free of restrictions.The Japanese were producing cloths of low grade, and supplying them to Empire countries at prioes much lower than we could quote: this was made possible by their low labour costs,With regard to the Russian situation to which Sir Arthur Balfour had referred, he agreed that a big accumulation of credit waB growing up.    There seemed to have been a tendency during the last few weeks for France to support Russia: the Russians were now offering business to us on bills backed by the French banks.GENERAL TRADE - WOOLLEN TEXTILES.00&apos;LOKEL WILLEY said that the reports received from the Federation of British Industries gave a rather more discouraging picture of the state of trade than the unemployment figures would seem to indioate.    This was probably attributable to the large amount of short time being worked generally as against total unemployment.The Federation had contemplated that the return to the gold standard would moan some deflation.    Raw materials were naturally subject to world influences. The prominent factor In conversion costs - services -were in this country virtxially pegged.    The present administration of unemployment relief oertainly tended to retard deflation of services; henoe our producers were dlsadvantaged in world competition.    If the position of*
If. I&quot; I ,&apos;l Ll I -IGENERAL TRAPS - WOOLLEN TEXTILES (Contd.).leading trades in Continental competing countries were examined, it would be found that, with the exoeption of Italy, the majority cf them were today operating well below capacity.   As their oosts wore lower, and the total volume of world trade insufficient, it seemed inevitable that under the existing conditions competing oountries would get the largor proportion of the world business that was going.    Unless some deflation In services occurred In this country we oould not hope to get back our trade.Sentiment in Industry in the oountry as a whole was depressed.A matter of immediate general interest was the possibility of subsidies being used to replace the present unemployment relief.    The Federation had arranged a strong Committee to examine the question.    The first meeting had indioated the general feeling that the matter should be explored, and it was intended that any claims whioh were put forward would be oarefully considered. Sir Alfred Mond had   poroonally attended the meeting, had explained his proposals, and amplified what was set out in his pamphlet.   A small Sub-Committee had been appointed to proqe^d aotively with investigation.The proposal in itself had seemed merely to substitute one economic heresy for another.    It could be said that subsidised labour was already recognised practically in some trades, as for instance, the textile trade; - where, in some oases,  employers pay for three days a week and tho State for three days.With regard to Russian credits, the Federation gathered that while in oertain commodities in the course of last year considerable sales had been made to Russia, it was reported that theso were now being more freely made, including tho giving of credit, in Borlin,In the wool textile trade unemployment was increasing, and prospects for the moment were very discouraging.    The world demand for wool textiles seemed quite insufficient to employ available machinery In different countries, even on a much restricted soale.    Italy was an exception, and there almost all textile mills were working full time, double shifts,Mr, Sutcliffo-Smith had asked him to refer to the Government Budget proposals in regard to silk; and to emphasize the general disquiet In Yorkshire as to the serious additional burden it would put on the Artificial Silk Trade and consequently   on the textile trades.Summing up the situation, Colonel Wllley said that trade generally seemed to be slightly worse, and orders for forward business were reported to be decreasing.
4 S JTEXTILES:    WOOL.MR. ANDREWS    said that the state of the Woollen textile indusTry continued as bad as last month,  or worse:    only 60% of the capacity of plant was working,     Only the day before a drop of over 15f. in price had taken place at a sale in London; this was unusually large,  and perhaps exaggerated the position a little.The chief trouble lay in loss of confidence; there were far more sellers than buyers in every department, prices were continually falling,  and there were no signs of stabilisation.He felt however that they could not go on much longer without some  improvement setting in.     What was wanted was a feeling that there would be no more raising of the Bank Rate, and stable conditions of trade.French and Italian competition was strong,  especially for articles of women&apos;s wear.TEXTILES:    WORSTED ETC.MR, H. SUTCLIFFfl SMITH.        (By Letter)r-The textile trade is still in a very depressed state and manufacturers and merchants are unanimous in saying that they have never known trade worse.The total unemployed figures in Bradford for the two weeks after faster,  increased by about 2Of over the two weeks preceding Easter, and the combined figures for total unemployment and short time show a large increase.The Home trade is stagnant and will not revive until buyers feel more confidence that wool has reached a stable price;  in the meantime only SOfi of the looms are running,  and between 50/60% of the spindles.    Better trade is, however,  expected from China and India, but the export trade generally remains slow and difficult.The Textile trade Is seriously alarmed at the suggested Excise Tax on articicial silk, and the imposition of this Tax will be a great and fatal mistake,  not because British women will have to pay more for their jumpers,  stockings,  or vanity bags,  but because it will result in a rapidly increasing export trade to India,  China, Egypt,  the Near East and elsewhere,  being diverted to our foreign competitors.    It is as fatal a mistake as those made at the initiation of the dye making industry,   which resulted in this huge industry being developed by the Germans, and we are all aware of the enormous difficulties,  notwithstanding a Prohibition Act, we now have in establishing this industry here on a really firm basis.The development of the use of artificial silk in Textile goods for export has been most marked the last few years,  and an excise tax of 2/6 per lb will make all the fabrics containing more than a slight percentage of artificial silk much dearer than similar goods produced by Germany, France or Italy;    consequently it will be impossible to retain our trade and our customers abroad will therefore have to be supplied by our foreign competitors.Lancashire and Yorkshire have devoted a great deal of ingenuity,  thought and research to secure a good share of the world&apos;s market for these goods,  and are just beginning to feel the result of this intensive work.
CONFIDENTIAL. TEXTILES; WORSTED ETC.   (CONTD.)To lose It now, as we should do,  simply means more looms out of work, more unemployment, more doles and less foreign money received to help to pay for food.The magnitude of the world&apos;s demands can he judged by the fact that it is anticipated that no less than 75,000 tons will be the world&apos;s production of artificial silk this year.If this Excise Tax is not withdrawn or modified so as to give this country an opportunity of continuing its export trade, I am bold enough to prophesy that in years to come the Government will keenly regret their action.CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY   said there has been a slight improvement in the Chemical Industry;    the index commodity, Sulphurio Acid, showed an increasing consumption and 67$ of the country1b producing power was now occupied, as against 60% when he last reported. Possibly however this might be due only to a seasonal demand.He was interested in Mr. Sanderson&apos;s observation (pegs 12) as to power alcohol production in Queensland,  in view of efforts being made in this country to undertake the distillation of power alcohol from sugar beet and damaged cereals;    it was encouraging that British industrial lists were prepared to consider such developments in these bad times.With regard to fertilizers, however, a noticeable feature was the poor demand from farmers;    even discounting the increased Imports,  it seemed clear that our farmers were using less chemical fertilizers.Unemployment In the industry amounted to 8.2% amongst insured persons - a slight improvement on past figures.FOOD INDUSTRIES - GENERAL TRADE.MR. MACHIN said that in the food industries there were some signs of improvement as compared with last year.   Bulk deliveries were maintained, and there seemed to be greater confidence on the part of the purchasing public.   A larger volume of goods was moving;    this had been assisted by the reduction in the price of sugar,  owing to big surplus stocks becoming available.      In tea, he understood,  the trade was sound, and was getting on a better footing,The export trade was holding its own, but showed no marked development;    in fact,  rather more difficulties were being met with in continental markets;    but where our manufacturers could compete on the spot, a large demand was found for British goods if these could be supplied at a competitive price.
FOOD INDUSTRIES - GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.).With regard to the question of credits for Russia, the Associated Chambers of Commerce had discussed this a fortnight since, and a suggestion had then been made to ask the Government to take steps for giving better credits for Russia; this proposal had, however, been rejected, as the Russian Government was thought not to be reliable, and in any case it appeared that Russia was getting the full credit which she could utilise.    During 1924, Imports from Russia into this country were to the value of nearly  20 million; our exports of British produce to Russia were nearly  4 million, and re-exports to Russia of foreign and Empire merchandise, over  7 million/ Russia had, therefore, a large favourable balance on her trade with this country, and the general opinion at the meeting, (whioh was a large and representative one), was that it was not desirable at present to take any steps to extend Russian credit.    On the other hand, they would not favour the curtailing of such credit to Russia as the trade figures showed to be warranted.The Chambers had also discussed his scheme with Sir Alfred Mond, who admitted that he could not suggest an answer to the difficulties referred to by Sir Arthur Balfour; he had promised to produoe a new amended soheme, but so far had not done- so.    Up to the present the Chambers had not been able to 3ee a way round these objections,     but they were discussing the subject again that afternoon.POTTERY,MR.1-HQLLINS said that exports of pottery were good, but the home&quot;trade was probably a little worse.    Unemployment had increased to some extent, and the Easter holidays had been somewhat extended.    Particulars had been obtained from the Labour exchanges of the number of totally unemployed and short-time workers in the industry.    These showed an inorease of 5.4 per oent. at the 4th May this year over the same date last year.As to total unemployment, the percentages to total numbers employed in the industry were for men 5$, and for women 8.9$; while as to short time, they were, for men 8.4$, and for women 11.4$.    60 per cent, of the men included in the unemployment figures were on short time and 40 per cent, were totally unemployed, while amongst the women 44 per oent. were totally unemployed and 56 per oent. on short time.
RUBBER MANUFACTURES.MR....BIRL3Y (by letter)&quot;The Rubber Trade is still   fairly well employed. This is generally the busiest time of the year, and though prioos leave a good deal to be desired, the demand in several branohos is distinotly good.    There has been a welcome drop in the Imports of Foreign made Solid Tyres.&quot;The most serious matter is the position in the Raw Rubber Market.   As you will probably have notioed, the stocks in London have been reduced since April 8th, by a further 4,797 tons, and the price for Spot rubber had advanced a further 1-fd. per lb.   The stocks at 11,720 tons are dangerously low, and though a further 10$ is released from May 1st there seems every prospect of their going still lower.   From the Manufacturers. point of view it is much to be hoped that the release under the Stevenson scheme can be expedited&quot;.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON said that tho fall in Wool prices was refleoted in Australia, as a good deal of the last wool clip was still unsold; unless this was cleared off before the next season&apos;s clip began to come through (in August and September) there would be over-lapping, and some concern was consequently, felt among wool interests In Australia.The price of metals was also affecting producing interests somewhat; but a set-off was furnished to some extent by the alterations In the rates of exchange which had been occasioned by the return to the gold standard.The Canadian Ford Company had now completed their plans for establishing works in Australia.   Two oompanies were being formed, one to manufacture, and the other to assemble and distribute oars.^Mention might also be made cf developments as regards the production of power alcohol in Queensland.    The Federal and Queensland Governments were interesting themselves in this.On account of the cessation of the zinc tailings operations at Broken Hill, the company concerned was considering setting up a paper pulp factory In Tasmania.The season had generally been- good, and as the Wheat orop had beon sold and tho greater part of the wool, the financial position was satisfactory.
INDIAN TRADE.MR. LINDSAY said that the Indian crop position at this time was an important factor, since it affects India&apos;s purchasing power during the year.     The Rice crop had been a heavy one, of 31 million tons, leaving some 2 or 3 million tons available for export,and that of cotton, six million bales, of which at least two, and possibly three, million would be available for export.     The Oilseed position also was good.In the case of the Wheat crop however, which usually amounted to some 9-g or 10 million tons, allowing 1 million tons for export, this year&apos;s was only a little over 8^ million tons, which would barely suffice for India&apos;s home consumption.     As regards Jute also,  weather conditions were not so far very favourable, but it was early yet to say how the crop would turn out.      Otherwise, however,  the crop position was good, and India&apos;s purchasing power during the year should be maintained.     He remarked that India purchases a good deal more in England than she sends us, and pursues the. oppoaite policy in the United States.Mr. Lindsay also put in a table illustrating the progress of the Indian cotton crop during the period 1915 to 1925, amending the table submitted by him at the previous meeting.This revised table showed the following main results:-Description	Average annual output 1915-1918 (In 1,000 bales )	Estimated crop during 1924-25 (in 1,000 bales )	\  * increaseShort Staple (belpw % inch) ,..	2,999	3,881	29.4Long Staple (7/6 inch and	1,161	2,107	81.5	4,160	5,988	43.9CHINESE TRADE.			MR. LANDALE said that, as regards imports of Manchester goods into Hongkong and China, only a moderate business was being transacted.    Prospects for the early future were not good, as recent arrivals were not going into consumption rapidly.In the export of engineering products to China, conditions were very dull, and little or no new business was offering.As regards exports from China, only a small business was being transacted, and there was very little demand from the Continent.Ihe railways in China were still being much interfered with by military occupation. The Peking Government had no effective control in the country.    &apos;a large business was being transacted between China and the United States, financed through London; but this was understood to be largely of a hand-to-mouth nature. Sufficient confidence was not felt in present prices for buying to take place freely.-13-
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE. MR. R.J. HOSE (by letter)&quot;Generally speaking,,  conditions in the prinoipal South Amerioan markets remain much the same as outlined in the note which I had pleasure in submitting for your last Meeting, although there are not wanting signs of slight betterment. Thus, a cable just received gives the realised deficit in the Brazilian national finances for 1924 at about 74,000 oontos (paper), and, although estimates provided for a surplus of 55,000 contos (paper), it is to be noted that the honest endeavours of the present Government to economise and to adopt the sound recommendations contained in the Report of the British Financial Mission, which visited Brazil early In 1924, have been nullified by the unavoidable military expenditure involved in suppressing the serious revolution in Sao Paulo in July last. Nevertheless,    in spite of this extraordinary expenditure, the 1924 deficit is very substantially lower than those for the two preceding years, which were 223,000 contos (paper) and &apos;4&quot;49,000 oontos (paper), respectively.     Publio confidence in Brazil is not yet entirely restored, as there are still bodies of insurgents established in a strong position In the State of Parana, and, owing to geographical conditions,  the Federal troops are experiencing difficulty in dislodging them.   Despite this fact, Brazilian foreign trade continues to expand, but any very definite improvement in the general situation will depend upon the restoration of conditions favourable for the introduction of foreign capital to develop new industries, and particularly the transport system, which at present is entirely inadequate to cope with the country&apos;s production. Notwithstanding possible reduotion in coffee orops in 1925-26, Brazil should fare very well from her exports of coffee, the present demand for which exoeeds supply.&quot;In Chile, the outlook now appears more stable,   president Alessandrl has returned amid popular acclamation.   Much will depend on the elections which are to be held this Summer, and, meanwhile, matters are marking time.   A satisfactory outcome of the elections,  combined with the fact that there has recently been a remarkable improvement in the national financial situation, and a consistent increase in foreign trade, especially in regard to nitrate shipments, should greatly Improve future prospeots.   The judgment given by the president of the United States regarding the Afrioa-Taona dispute with Peru, which is regarded by Chile as a juridical triumph, has tended to unite the Chilean political parties, and has definitely contributed to a better outlook in this respeot. . However, the fate of the disputed Provinces is to be settled by plebiscite, which, according to general opinion both in Chile and Peru, will be adverse to the latter country.     In view of possible trouble over this old-standing and bitter question, especially if the plebiscite Bhould result against Peru, the outlook for the next few months is obBcure, particularly in Peru, and it cannot be expeoted that local merchants in either Republic will desire to increase their commitments until the matter is definitely out of the way.     Trade generally in Peru continues very dull, and travellers of foreign firms in the ootton, woollen, and hardware lines report a laok of orders.&quot;Argentina oontinues to be by far the brightest market in South Amerioa.   As   anticipated, 1924 olosed with a favourable trade balance equivalent in sterling to no less than  32,326,000 as oompared with substantial adverse balances in each of the years 1921 to 1923.     That the wealth derived therefrom is now
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD.,)being increasingly utilised in purchases from abroad is indicated by the fact that reoeipts at the Buenos Aires Customs House during the first quarter of this year totalled ^84,339,000 (paper), an increase on the corresponding period of last year of over ^14,000,000 (paper).     There is every reason to believe that this purchasing movement from abroad should extend over the next few months.    The national financial situation is steadily improving,  it being reported that 1924 closed with a surplus balance, whilst the unwieldy Floating Debt which has contributed so largely to Argentina&apos;s financial difficulties in the past is being consistently reduced.&quot;FINANCE.MR. BRAND said that a noticeable feature of the exchange rrarket had been that, during the first two or three days after the enforcement of the gold standard,  the exchange did not go up to gold par - a fact which puzzled the exchange market a little; probably it was owing to the fact that no one wanted to send it up.     The financial newspapers, quite wrongly, seemed to regard It as a sort of crime to send gold out of our own market.Now, however,  the rate had moved up beyond the point at which it was profitable to send gold out.     There had been a large speculative full account In sterling, but speculators now knew that they had secured their profit, and had ple&amp;ty of time in which to cover.Large sums of money had been placed here by the United States banks during the last few days in order to get the benefit of the higher rate of interest.   The general view in the City was that there was no reason at all why the Bank Rate should go up;    though, needless to say, ultimately its course would have to be governed by price levels.   While our interest rates remained considerably higher than   in the United States,  there seemed no reason why it should not be easy to maintain rates without the export of gold,American conditions were for the time being moving rather the other way;    there was a general slacking off in various directions.    If any change in interest rates took place there, a change downwards was rather being looked for.    This might only be a temporary depression, as at this time last year, but there seemed no present likelihood of a firmer money market in the United States.The German financial position was not a good one,   German Bankers said they did not see how German industry could make enough profits to pay 12% to 15% for their money,  as they now have to.    There seemed to be a certain amount of disquietude in Germany as to the position;    and there were indications that the purchasing power of the German population was at present very low,   Rates for overdrafts In Germany were about 12^, though they expected to get credit here at about 9%In Belgium and Franoe credit was much restricted. He was disposed to think that our trade was suffering from the continental lack of purchasing power,  and that this would continue until capital became cheaper in Europe.
FINANCE (OONTD.)In reply to a question by Mr, Gallaeher as to the probable influenoe of the return to the gold standard or employment hares Mr, Brand said that the question was a big one.     Personally he was strongly in favour of this step,  though it certainly meant a risk of higher money rates here if they became higher in the United States,     But in the long run (and that probably not a very long one) if many oountries aeerb back to one ^stand^rd, a position would be reached more nearly approximating to&apos;%hat of 1914, with results which wou^d be bound to be beneficial to us, on account of our large foreign trade,Th0 &quot;bill on London&quot; had never, he thought, lost credit throughout the world;    and the return %d,^the gold standard would tend to strengthen it, and induce people to leave their balances here.     He attached more importance, however,  to the stabilisation of prices etc, resulting from the gold standard,BANKING - GENERAL TRADE.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE said that his bank&apos;s branch reports disclosed&quot;a position very similar to that of last month.      In the Scottish coal trade a feeling of pessimism continued,  while the north east coast of England,  also, was going through bad times as regards $oal,   iron and steel,  shipbuilding and shipping * The wool and cotton textile industries seem to be in a not much better state.     Generally it might perhaps be said that the condition of the heavy industries had altered slightly for the wor^se, while that of other trades remained much as before.As regards monetary conditions,  the chief event was,  of course, the Budget and the announcement as to the return to the gold standard,     This had not had an immediate.effect on the exchanges, nor had it resulted in a loss of gold.-     It . furnished once more a barometer of conditions which had been unused for some time.      In some quarters this step had given rise to fears of a tightening of money rates and a rise in the bank rate.     There seemed, however, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had said In Parliament,  to be no reason to anticipate a rise in the bank rate.     Money was coming from abroad to this country,  in view of the better rates which it sould command here.Another factor which helped to tighten money rates was the antioipation of large payments to be made for the Conversion Loan,     Some 10 or 15 millions sterling had, he understood,  to be found for this purpose in the Immediate future.With regard to the question of Russian oredits,  tav which Sir Arthur Balfour had referred, he said that if Sir Arthur could furnish more particulars, he wouid like to examine this question.    Personally he did not see any signs of an increase. Sir Arthur Balfour replied that he was not referring to financial credits, but to exporters&apos;  credits obtained by Centrosoyus and Arcos In placing orders.     Exporters,  if they tried to insure these credits, found that they oould only be insured up to half the amount, and for a period of net- more than 3 months,&quot; at a rate of some 6 per cent.

(i O &apos;iBANKING- 2  (Contd).Mr. Pease remarked that en the trade figures which had been given, it would seem that Russia could afford to buy from us without requiring extensive credits.With regard to the Mond scheme, he considered this to be entirely artificial and unsound, and not on an economic basis.MR. TENNANT said that he agreed with Mr. Brand and Mr. Beaumont Pease as to the question of a rise in the bank rate.     There was no chance, he thought, of any immediate rise, though it was true that the situation was dependent on the United Statesj   but American rates seemed more likely to go down than otherwise.He mentioned that the motor trade, which was not represented at this meeting, appeared to be prosperous. Generally he agreed with Mr. Beaumont Pease that the state of the heavy trades seemed a little worse.     There had been a slight Improvement in the chemical trade, other trades remained much the same.MR* GALLACHER said that Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society1s results for 17 weeks of the current half-year had shown a slight increase in business, amounting to between 2% and Zfo over all departments.     This, however, was rather disappointing, since they had hoped for a considerable increase. On the consumers1 side there appeared to be a definite trend towards lower-priced articles;    the standard of living of the people appeared to be falling.     As an example of this, he mentioned that the Society&apos;s tweed mill in Scotland was only occupied up to about 40$ of its capacity, while there was &quot;a big demand for ready-made clothing both for men&apos;a and women&apos;s wear.     In the case of furniture also the demand in Scotland was now for lighter articles and lower quality.     This was, perhaps, partly due to the building of smaller houses, as in England.As regards the movement for securing uniformity of prices, he referred to the setting up of the Grooers&apos; Proprietary Articles Association, the object of which was to fix wholesale and retail prlceB.      The Co-operative movement had been following these developments closely, and were fixing uniform prices for their own productions.     The goods which they buy from outside firms were already largely subject to similar restrictionsBANKING - GENERAL TRADE.CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES - (Scotland).
CONFIDENTIAL. CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (SCOTLAND)  (OONTD).With regard to business in particular commodities, a Canadian brand of cheese, though not of very good quality, was now becoming popular in Scotland, and was ousting the native product.Business in tea had been dull, probably for the reason that when it was known that an increase was about to take place in the price, the Sooiety, In accordance with their practice, had warned their retail branches In advance and the latter had accumulated large stocks, up to as much as six or soven weeks&apos; supply.    There was more activity again, however, now.As regards coal, of which the Sooiety dealt in some 8 to 10 thousand tons per week, the pithead price was now 5/- pt*r ton less than a year ago.    This seemed to bear out what Sir Adam Nimmo had said.   A demand was showing Itself in Scotland for English coal.    Some complaints were being made that the prices of export coal (about 15/- per ton) are lower than those for home and household consumption (which were about  2 per ton in Glasgow for household coal); consumers considered that export coal was being favoured at their own expense.    The President pointed out that export ooal had, no doubt, to be priced at the level of foreign ooal, or no business oould be done abroad.Mr. Gallacher added that with regard to the Mond Scheme, the Sooiety had two factories, one producing tweeds and the other blankets; the scheme would, in their case give a subsidy of 23/- per man per week, or about 40fo of wages; this might assist them in competition, but the only result would be to shift the locus of unemployment. What was really wanted was increased consumption.    The Co-operative Societies were not at all pre-possessed with the Mond Scheme.RAILWAYS,MrU HURCOMB said that the railway results were affected by the Easter holidays.    Comparing the first seventeen weeks of this year, however, with those of last year (including Easter in each case) passenger reooipts were 3yi up, but merchandise    (in particular, coal) 2$ down; the aggregate figures, therefore, remained about the same.As regards tonnago carried,, the latest available figures were those for February, which showed a falling off as compared with February of last year in iron and steel, but an Inoroaso in building materials and road stone.   As regards other merchandise, the traffic was perhaps not quite so heavy, but the variations were not great and affected only small amounts.It was possible that the figures for February 1924 were a little inflated by traffic hold up during the previous month, on account of the strike which was then taking place; and the actual comparison might, therefore, be slightly more favourable than appeared on the face of it.
CONFIDENTIAL. RAILWAYS    (CONTD.)SIR HERBERT WALKER (by letter):-&quot;So far as railway traffics are concerned the situation is even more depressing than it was a month ago, and the only trades which show any improvement at all are Building and Road Making.&quot;The decrease of traffic connected with the Coal Iron and Steel Trades continues and applies more particularly to the export of coal, and my enquiries go to show that there is little or no indication of an immediate revival of trade in this direction.&quot;UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES  (MINISTRY OF LABOUR).MR. PH ILL IPS said that the unemployment figures for April 27th were 14,000 below those for March 23rd In spite of an increase of 38,000 at Easter.     A year ago there was a decrease of 16,000 over the same period, but the figure for the end of April 1924 was 139,000 below that for the end of April 1925.      This figure is of course subject to a deduction of 70,000 or so, making the real Increase about 70,000.As between March 1924, and March 1925,  on the basis of unemployment books lodged,  the increase was 151,000, or from 9.8 to 11.1 per cent.     The percentage unemployment among females remained unchanged at 8.8j    that among males Increased from 10.1 to 11.9.Coal mining with an increase of 122,000,  steel smelting etc with 15,000,   tinplates with 10,000,  shipbuilding with 8,000, woollen and worsted with 23,000, and dock labour with 13,000, accounted together for an Increase of about 190,000.On the other hand cotton shewed a decrease of 48,000 and   general engineering one of 27,000, or 75,000 taken together.Most of the other main Industries shewed little change either way.
