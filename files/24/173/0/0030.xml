The Lord Privy Seal h ted throughout as Chairman ofthe Committee.2.       The circumstances which necessitate the introduction of legislation to deal with this matter were set out shortly in a memorandum circulated to the Cabinet in February last by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, CPs 94 (25).      It may, however, be stated here that the fundamental reason for legislation is that,  in its absence, the value of  100 tithe rentcharge will rise in 1926 from  109 to approximately  130 and may be expected to rise further until 1930 after which a gradual fall may be anticipated.While it  is extremely desirable from the point of?frTr-r- ,    view of the agricultural  interest that tithe rentchargebe rent-should not rise next year to  130,  the Church and the other titheowners cannot reasonably be expected to accept less than an amount representing as nearly as can be calculated the actuarial value of their tithe rentcharge in perpQ-tuity.    It is believed that the stabilisation of tithe
rentcharge at such a figure would be welcomed by tithe payers as substituting a fixed for an indefinite and \Tarying liability,,The difficulty of estimating future corn prices is, of course, apparent, and estimates made in 1923&apos; by an independent expert Committee of 1924 prices have, as a matter of fact, proved to have been too low.      The Committee understand that the best export opinion considers that a fair estimate of the perpetuity value would be  105, and this figure has been inserted in the draft Bill attached to this Report,4.       SPhe present complicated position as regards rating may be summarised as followsOwner of Tithe Rent charge.Und e r &quot;Pe rman ent&quot; Legislation*Under &quot;Temporary&quot; Legislation expiring 1st.

Without going olosely into this question it may be stated.that as a result  of the negotiations which have taken place between the representatives of clerical tithe owners andlandowners, the fact has emerged that the Church would besatisfied with an irreducible minimum of  100 for every 100 par value tithe rentcharge, free of rates, but subjectto costs of collection.      Provided that State assistance is forthcoming on the lines, and for the reasons sot out later inthis Report, the proposals in the draft Bill enable theChurchxs minimum to be conceded, while at the same time theincumbents will,  through Queen AnneTs Bounty, contribute tothe rates an amount approximating to that which they arecontributing at present under the temporary legislation.5.      The Committee are informed that the ChurchTs willing-ness.to accept  100 free of rates for each  100 tithe rentoharge is conditional on a scheme of redemption compulsory on the tithe payer by means of a sinking fund contribution over a period of years.      landowners, while not strongly in favour of redemption, are unlikely to object vigorously to such a scheme in the case of tithe rentoharge attached to a benefice, provided that their total annual liability on account of such tithe rentcharge, including the Sinking Pund Charge, does not materially exceed their present annual payment in respect of tithe -rentcharge, namely,   109,3 did.    The proposals in the  draft Bill provide for an annual payment for eighty-five years of  109e10.0d.  in respect of Ecclesiastical Tithe Rentcharge.The Commit too further understand that there is no real demand on the part  of landowners for the compulsory redemption of lay tithe rentcharge, and that the majority of the tithe-owners themselves do not  desire it.
&apos;1 iii giilaiifiS--e&amp;9*&apos;oot .onIVisiiflfiH..6.     One of the most important- details of the proposals advanced &quot;by the Church aim at the centrali-organisation of the collection of tithe rentcharge, and the relief of the Incumbents from this unwelcome duty,It is also tin assent! at feature of the Committee1 a scheme that Queen Annexe Bounty should&apos;be invited to act as the central authority for this pur-pose,      The Governors would be charged with the responsibility of determining what clerical tithe rentcharge ie payable, of collecting it, paying over to the Exchequer the proportion due in commutation of the rate liability, investing the sinking.fund charge, and, after meeting their costs of collection, distrlbut-ing the balance to the Incumbents.?.     The Committee considered the case of the incumbent of a benefice Kith an income of less than 300 per annum who, as a result of the Ecclesiastical Rates Act, 1920, now receives a net  109, 3,11,(leas cost of collection) for every  100 par value tithe rentcharge.     Under the present proposals he will receive  100 and the reduction in the case of so small an income will be extremely serious.     The Committee therefore decided to give the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries discretion to include in the draft Bill a provision allowing present incumbents with a benefice income not exceeding  300 a year to postpone the operation of the sinking fund for five years, in which case the incumbent would, during that period receive  104.10.0, for every  100 commuted value, and thereafter suffer a sinking fund deduction of  5. 12. 6., per annum instead of 04,10.0., this higher rate continuing in the ease of cuch a living to the end of the redemption period,
The Minister has had the opportunity of mentioning the point to the Archbishops, who, without feeling able to express considered opinions, were not disposed to recommend such action, principally on the ground that it would have the effect of placing an incumbent in tie Invidious position of Imposing burdens on the benefice for the whole period of the sinking fund accumulation. Upon further consideration, however, It appeared that the additional deduction after the five years would be  1. 2, 6, only and the incumbent would receive  -98.17 e6., instead of  100, and In view of the comparatively small additional cost involved to the benefice in future years the Minister is on the whole inclined to advise the inclusion of the suggested provision in the final draft of the-Bill.8.     The Commit tee are of the opinion that the present basis of assessment of incumbents to income tax should not be altered to their detriment, and that any legislation necessary to secure this should be obtained,9,    The Committee considered the position of these bodies who own tithe rentcharge of the estimated commuted value of  98,000,      The Act of 1920 gave temporary relief to the Corporations while tithe rentchargc remained stereotyped,, by standardising their contribution to rates in respect of their tithe rentcharge at the amount paid in 1918, and the proposals in the draft Bill have been framed with the intention of continuing such relief but with the assistance of the Exchequer instead of at the expense of the other ratepayers in the Parish out of which the tithe rentoharge is payable.     It will be observed that Ecclesiastical Corporation tithe rent-charge will be transferred to and collected by Queen Anne&apos; s Bounty as the central authority, and will be redeemed
3 Q 9 *j &amp;SUM.t charge.by at)ana of a sinking fund for a slightly shorter period than in the case of incumbents&apos; tithe rentcharge owing to the fact that a smaller net income has thereby to be secured.10.     The Committee have formed the opinion that a schemeof compulsory redemption of tithe rentcharge payable to owners other than Incumbents and Ecclesiastical Corporationsis Impracticable at the present time.      Not only is there nowidespread desire among landowners for such redemption but certain of the tltbeowners, e.g. the&apos; Oxford and CambridgeColleges, are adverse to redemption at the present time whenrates are high.     Apart, therefore, from stabilisation as already explained, the Committee do not recommend that any action should be taken as regards lay tithe rentoharge,except to remove a grievance under which lay titheownerssuffer at the present time.     Under the Tithe Act, 1918,on the occasion of redemption, full rates on the average ofthe preceding three years are deducted from the gross annual &apos;value of the tithe rentcharge, whereas the agriculturallandowner, after redemption, is only called upon to payone-Quarter of the rates on the increased assessable valueof his land after redemption.     The draft Bill proposes that in future the deduction for the purposes of redemptionshould be on the basis of   two-thirds-? of the rates paid.JM&amp;U^h   11.     Apart from stabilisation, the Committee do not Melonpropose that any action should be taken as regards this tithe rentcharge.     As already explained,   the Commissioners pay half rates in respect of their tithe rentcharge formerly attached to benefices, and this relief   granted under the Welsh Church Aot, 1914, will continue.-o-
reiit&apos;- 12,      The proposals outlined in this Report would heto     unworkable in the absence of financial assistance from the State.     At present the Local Taxation Account contributes approximately  370,000 in relief of rates in respect of tithe rentcharge under the Tithe Rentcharge Rates Act, 1899, while a further amount estimated at approximately  290,000 is contributed by the other ratepayers as a result of the. Ecclesiastical Rates Act, 1920.     Under the scheme outlined in the attached draft Bill a fixed sum of about  100,000 would be contributed to rates by Queen AnneTs Bounty, representing the amount which is at present actually paid by incumbents in respect  of rates on their tithe rentcharge; a variable amount dependent on the future poundage of rates but estimated at the outset not to exceed  355,000, would be payable out of the Local Taxation Account for eighty-five years (the duration of the sinking fund for redemption) in continuation of the existing liability under the Act of 1899, leaving a further variable sum estimated at the outset not to exceed  275,000 to be paid by the Exchequer into the local Taxation Account for payment cut  to the Rating Authorities.asfeioal It is estimated that  the rates at present leviedtiong.amount to approximately  33,000 but that as a result of the Ecclesiastical Sates Act,  lo,20, the amount actually paid at present in rates is approximately  17,000.      The effect of the proposals in the draft Bill will be to impose on tho Exchequer a liability of approximately  16,000 *13. Thus the total new Exchequer charge under the draft Bill consisting of payments on account of rates in respect of tithe rentchargo attached to benefices and
belonging to Ecclesiastical Corporations will not exceed  291 ,000,  i.e.  275,00 0 in respect  of tithe rentcharge attached to benefices arid  16,000 on account of tithe rent charge owned by Ecclesiastical Corporations and may nno-art in course of time to a considerably smaller sum.It vill be observed that the draft Bill removes the grievance- of the other ratepayers who are at present ]required to contribute  306,000 f 290, COO incximbonts tithe rentcharge and  16,000 Ecclesiastical Corporations tithe rentcharge) as a result of the Ecclesiastical Hates Act, 1920, and to this extent it may reasonably be argued that the Exchequer contribution will go to the relief of the general body of ratepayers rather, than of the ChurchIt will be observed that the Exchequer contribution will be less next year than tho amount at present contributed by the other rate-payers owing to the value of  100 tithe rentcharge being fixed at  105 Instead of  109*3*lid.      Cn the other hand, the State contribution is necessary to enable the Church to receive  100 free of rates for every  100 par value tithe rentcharge.The Committee are, however,  of&quot; opinion, that in order to arrive at a final settlement of the question on lines which will bo regarded as equitable alike by the Church and the tithe payers, a contribution by tho State in relief of rates, which under the Act of 1920 have to be made up by the general body of ratepayers instead of being paid by the Church9. can be defended, and in the special circumstances is amply justified.14.      The Committee have endeavoured in framing their legislative proposals to maintain as far as possible the status quo as regards the annual amount actually paid and received in respect of tithe rentcharge.      Instead of paying
 109 * 3olid for every  100 commuted tithe rentcharge, the tithe payer fill he required to pay fl)  109.10.0d.  for eighty-five years in respect of tithe rentoharge attached to henefices;   (2)  109olO^0dc for eighty-one yearsjin respect of tithe rentcharge belonging to Ecclesiastical Corporationsj (3)  105&apos; in perpetuity in respect of other tithe rent charge *As regards the tithe owners the position will he that in respect of every  100 commuted tithe rentcharge fl) incumbents will receive  100 free from rates, the minimum demand put forward by the Church;  (2) Seclesiastical Corporations will receive approximately  88 as compared with about  91.10aOd. at present;    (3) other titheowners will receive  105 less rates, in perpetuity, instead of  109,3clldp less rates,  in all cases subject to cost of collection.The Committee recommend the CabinetTo give general approval to the principles for the stabilisation and redemption pf tithe rent-charge embodied In the draft Tithe Bill, and, subject to the usual examination of the Bill by the Home Affairs Committee, to authorise the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to arrange for its introduction in the House of Commons at an early date*Signed on behalf of the Committee.
