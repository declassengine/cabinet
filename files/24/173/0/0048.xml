[/ This Document is the,; Property of His Britannic Majesty1 s Government.CABINET. ISBORET. ---ID,P. 246(25). Home Affairs Committee. r-\ l :PI SBASES. OF ANIJA*ALS BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary on applying the Bill to northern Ireland.The draft Bill v/hich has been circulated by the Ministry of Agriculture  (CP.241  (25)) does not apply to Northern Ireland,  and I desire to recommend the Home Affairs Committee to approve of its being made applicable to Northern Ireland with the necessary modifications.The position as regards Northern Ireland is as follows:-Exchequer grants to local authorities in Northern Ireland in respect of compensation for the slaughter of cattle for tuberculosis were revived at the beginning of 1920,  and the Treasury have  sanctioned a short continuance of the grants;    but they intimated that their further continuance ought to be recognised by legislation,  and suggested that the question of including provisions for this purpose with regard to Northern Ireland in the English Ministry of Agriculture&apos;s Bill should be considered In consultation with that Department.    The matter has -since been the subject of correspondence between the Home Office, the Ministry of Agriculture and Northern Ireland,  but owing to an oversight the present draft of the Bill does not contain a clause extending it to Northern Ireland.It seems clearly right that the proposal to apply the Bill to Northern Ireland should be accepted in principle. (Diseases of Animals are a reserved service and the matter is, therefore, one for the Imperial Parliament), The grants to local authorities have, as indicated above, already been revived since the War and the inclusion of Northern Ireland in the present Bill is proposed in order to regularise the position.    Moreover,  although the&apos;&apos;
and Dairies Act,   1915,  of which the present Bill is a complement, does not apply to Northern Ireland,  it is thought that the Northern Ireland Government will probably introduce corresponding legislation shortly and this still further strengthens the case for the continuance of the grants.    The amount of money involved is not largei    The recent cost of the Exchequer grants in Northern Ireland has been at the rate of from  1,000 to  1,500 per annum.It may also be mentioned that according to figures obtained at the end of last year the number of deaths from tuberculosis per 1,000 of population was greater in Northern Ireland -than in the Free State,  and greater in Ireland, even taken as a whole, than in Scotland or&apos;England and Wales.Steps have already been taken with a view to settling the necessary drafting amendments for applying the Bill to Northern Ireland,  so as to avoid delay in the event, of my colleagues approving of my proposal.W.J.H.18th Hay,   1925.Fllfi-7.
