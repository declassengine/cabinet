AND fflFICATIGK DP SERVICES.The Committee had before them a Koto V.P.C12 by the Minister of Health covering a Memorandum on a scheme of Poor Law Reform.The Minister of Health reminded the Committee that the Rating and Valuation Bill was the first step in his contemplated legislative programme, the second stage of which would be concerned with the Reform of the Poor Law,      As soon as the Rating and Valuation Bill was published and circulated It was proposed that the Ministry of Health should open negotiations with the Local Authorities but before this could be done it would be necessary for the Government to take decisions on the questions of principle summarised on page 12 of the memorandum, 1.      In view of the difficulties indicated in the opening paragraphs of the Memorandum the Minister of Health suggested, that the recommendations of the Maclean Committee respecting the transfer of the functions of the Guardians to the County and County-Borough Councils and the disappearance of the Poor Law should be carried out in two stages,  the first of which should be Concerned with a transference of administrative powers,  the alteration of the Peer Lawitself being postponed&apos;until actual experience of -unifi^for administration results in a demand/unified services,.The President of the Board of Education suggested that the  transfer to the major Local Authorities of the powers of the Guardians over the right to relief might result in largely increased expenditure on that service as the Authorities Sould no longer be in a position to shelter them-selves behind the decisions of the Guardians
THE 00-pNATION OF LAW RELIEF UN2MPL0Y-W BENEFIT.respecting eligibility for- relief,      It might he desirable to retain a separate authority to decide the right to relief, transferring all the other functions of the Guardians to the Authorities as proposed.The Minister of Health agreed that this proposal would be acceptable to the Boards of Guardians but it was open to the serious objections  (l) that In as much as it involved the existence of two Authorities it rendered the attainment of unified and efficient administration more difficult and (2) that it would mean that In elections to the Bod-/- whose sole function was relief of destitution the successful candidates would be those who were prepared to offer the greatest benefi ts.The Committee agreed -To adopt the proposal of the Minister of Health that the scheme should In the first Instance be restricted to a tran3-ference of administrative powers - the Poor Law being preserved subject only to such modifications as may be required by the change of authorities and the new authorities to be free, under the general direction of the Ministry of Health t^ work out their own schemes for the performance of the transferred functions&apos;.2,     The Committee were informed that it was hopedthat under the new arrangements to emphasise the distinction between Unemployment Benefit and PoorLaw Relief and to prevent the one being used asalternative or supplemental to the other&apos;.      Save in exceptional circumstances a Local Authority wouldnot be allowed to give poor law relief to any personwithin the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.it was most desirable to revert to the ElizabethanPoor Law and to restrict relief to the really
die)destitute So far as posaibie.Tlie Committee agreed -To approve the proposals of the Minister of Health as set out in Section VII of the Appendix to the Scheme for linking up Unemployment Insurance with relief to the Able Bodied.ALLOCATION OF      3.      The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that certain TRANSFERREDFUNCTIONS County Councils would he reluctant to  assume the newBETWEEN COUNTYCOUNCILS AND        responsibilities proposed and would be only too MINORAUTHORITIES. ready to delegate their functions to the MinorAuthorities.      It would be deplorable if the result of the government&apos;s proposals was merely to sub-stitute the District Councils for the Boards of Guardians.     He would like to see the County Council&apos;s powers of delegation restricted to Committees of their own, the Committees to include members co-opted by the Councils.The Minister of Health said that his policy was to develop and encourage the County Councils as much as posaibie, the dangers of over decentralization were obvious.     At the same time in view of the different conditions prevailing in different counties all Councils could not be treated alike and some pro-visional arrangements would be necessary.      In cases where the County Councils  pre   reluctant to exercise their new powers it might bd necessary to modify the policy of centralising in them the administration of the Poor Law.The Committee agreed -To approve the proposal of the Minister of Health that each County Council sho,uXd be required to frame, after consultation with the minor Looal Authorities, a scheme (for the allocation among them of the functions and institutions transferred from the Guardians) on the general lines of Alternative A Section II of Appendix to the Scheme.
To approve the proposal  that  the new authorities should be empowered, but not required,to&apos;co-opt persons who are not members of the authorities to assist in the discharge of the, new duties.5.      The Committee agreed -To approve the proposal  (paragraph 34 of Scheme) that as regard the allocation of the property and liabilities of the Guardians in cases where local agreement cannot be secured the duty should be carried as a rule by the Minister of Health or in exceptional cases by temporary Comma;-sioners appointed for the purpose.6.      The Financial Secretary to the Treasurysuggested that the new authorities should first beestablished and given the grants to which the oldauthorities were entitled.      Subsequently theAssigned Revenue System could be abolished and its place taken by block grants for Health Services,xt was however pointed out that the Authorities would.require Exchequer assistance in respect of servicestransferred from the Guardians which were aidedservices of the Authorities and that the additionalgrants  would on this basis amount to  1,500,000.The Committee agreed -To request the Minister of Health to prepare for the Committee1s consideration a detailed, financial scheme on the lines indicated in paragraph 59 of the Scheme.7.     The Committee agreed -To adopt the proposal of the Minister of Health, that no provision should be included in the proposed legislation for dealing with settlement and removal but that the present law should continue in operation subject to the consequential changes resulting from the alteration of the area.
tlCATION LONDON.lie committee agreed -To adopt the suggestions of the Minister of Health respecting the application of the scheme to London set out in paragraphs 51 and 52 of the Scheme under which the Maclean Committee&apos;s recommendation will he modified in the direction of centralising more powers and duties In the County Council.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 28th April,  1925.

SECRET.SCHEME OF  POOR LAW  REFORM,1. The Maclean Committee set out to reconcile, and largely succeeded in reconciling, the divergent views of the Majority and Minority Reports of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws, and the general principles of the Committee&apos;s Report have been accepted by previous Governments. It may be said therefore that the Maclean Committee&apos;s proposals at present hold the field, and the scheme of reform appended to this Memorandum has been framed on the basis of those proposals. More than seven years,&apos;however, have passed since! the Report of the Maclean Committee was issued, and the intervening period has witnessed a number of changes in social conditions and a number of new legislative enactments which, taken in conjunction with the exigencies of Parliamentary time and other limiting factors appear to call for a modification in certain important directions of the scheme propounded by the Maclean Committee..2. The principal difficulties which arise in attempting to make the Maclean Committee&apos;s proposals serve as the basis for a statutory scheme, and the nature of the modifications which will probably be found necessary, are indicated in this Paper.&quot; Break-op of the Poor Law &quot; and Unification of Services.3. The first, and perhaps the most difficult, of the questions to be answered, is that which arises from the proposal of the Maclean Committee that, in addition to the transfer of the Guardians&apos; functions to the County and County Borough Councils, the Poor Law, itself should disappear, and that provision should be made for the performance of the services at present rendered under the Poor LaAv by means of an application and extension of the Public Health, Education, Lunacy and other Acts.4. The Maclean Committee recommended that :- (a) The provision at the expense of the rates, with or without Exchequer grants, for the sick and infirm (including maternity and infancy and the aged : ., requiring institutional care and all institutions appropriated to any of these), &apos; should be made by&apos;the Council under Public Health Acts suitably extended. The Council should organise such preventive and curative treatment as the cases individually require by means of their specialised institutions and medical staff.(6) The provision for all children able to attend school (including residential and special schools of all kinds) should be regarded as predominantly a matter of educational training, and should be made by the Local Education Authority under the Education Acts suitably extended.(c) The provision for the mentally deficient, and for persons of unsound mind, whether certified or not, including all institutions appropriated to these classes, should be made by the Council under the Lunacy and Mental Deficiency Acts, suitably extended, and through the Committee or Com-mittees administering their powers under these Acts.5. It is evident, however, that neither the translation of this doctrine into the form of a statutory enactment, nor the solution of the complicated problems to which its practical application must inevitably give rise, can be accomplished without considerable difficulty.6. What is implied in the phrase &quot; Abolition of the Poor Law &quot; ? As is stated above, the intention was not only that the health services should be transferred from the Boards of Guardians to the County and Municipal Authorities, but also that these services should cease to be administered under the Poor Law Statutes an Orders. From this it would seem to follow that the Poor Law Statutes should be repealed, and the Orders rescinded. But this is not a task to be lightly undertaken, and, before embarking upon it, it would be necessary to forecast the consequences and endeavour to appraise their gravity. If the Poor Law is abolished ltmus be reasonably clear what it is that is being destroyed. ,7. In the first place would the right to relief be destroyed ?    In so far as the right to relief is defined by the Statutes what would be the effect of repealing those Statutes upon which such a large and important body of case law has based ?Ax   (2)23982   l?k 323   125   4/25   b &amp; S
8. These questions would require the most careful and critical examination before any attempt could be made to draw the heads of a Bill which had as one of its objects the abolition of the Poor Law itself, but it would seem that one of the three following courses would have to be taken : (1) All the Acts relating to the relief of the poor might be repealed in their entirety. If this were done it would probably be necessary to reaffirm explicitly the statutory right to relief, as well as to lay down the powers and duties of the authorities entrusted with the administration of the health and other transferred services, and the conditions under which those services should be rendered.(2) All the Acts relating to the relief of the poor might be repealed with the exception of the Act of Elizabeth. This was the suggestion made by the authors of the Minority Report of the Royal Commission, who considered that thereby they would preserve the statutory right to relief.(3) The repeal might be limited to those particular provisions of the Acts relating to the relief of the poor which appeared to be inconsistent with the new doctrine.9. Each of these courses seems open to serious practical objection. The adoption of either of the first two would necessitate not merely the construction of a fresh code designed to give effect to the accepted principles of reform, but also the re-enactment, with or without alteration, of numerous provisions scattered all over the Poor Law Statutes and dealing with a large variety of complicated and contentious subjects, e.g., chargeability and recovery, settlement and removal, adoption of children, bastardy, religious creed, vagrancy, and so on. Under the third plan it would still be necessary to frame a new code to fit the new principles while it would also be necessary to undertake a meticulous examination of every provision of every Poor Law Statute-and there are some 300 Acts of Parliament relating directly or indirectly to the relief of the poor.10. A similar difficulty would be met with in attempting to give precise statutory effect to the Maclean Committee&apos;s recommendations that provision for the sick and infirm should in the future be made &quot; under Public Health Acts suitably extended &quot;; that provision for all children able to attend school should be made &quot; under the Education Acts suitably extended &quot;; and . that provision for the mentally deficient and for persons of unsound mind should be made &quot; under the Lunacy and Mental Deficiency Acts suitably extended.&quot;11. The object aimed at by the Maclean Committee would no doubt be partially attained by the inclusion in the scheme of a definite allocation of functions to specified committees of the County and County Borough Councils. But it must be recognised that this would be a most controversial proposition, and that it would almost certainly be bitterly opposed by the Local Authorities to whom the Guardians&apos; functions are to be transferred. This particular proposal was indeed attacked as soon as it was made, and two important reservations were made on this subject by two of the signatories to the Report.12. In the separate Memorandum which he appended to the Report Sir James Curtis said :  &apos;&quot; If County, Borough and other Councils are to be entrusted with further important functions, I consider these bodies should be allowed greater freedom than the recommendations permit of in allocating the new duties to committees. A scheme appropriate to Manchester or Birmingham might be fouhd cumbersome and costly for Eastbourne. Similarly, a scheme suitable for a county mainly industrial, such as Stafford, might be found unworkable in a Rural County such as Hereford.&quot;13. Mr. Pritchard dealt with the same point in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of his Memorandum.   He wrote : &quot; The scheme relating to County Boroughs is in my opinion open to the objection that it involves unnecessary interference with the councils in regard to the manner in which, and particularly the committees through whom the transferred^ functions are to be performed. In the past it was the practice of Parliament to confer and impose definite powers and duties upon Town Councils, and not to tell them how their functions were to be performed or what committees they must appoint;  the powers and dutiesa   2308! Ji
being prescribed by Parliament, the responsibility for finding the best and most suitable method of carrying them out according to the local circumstances was left with the council in each ease. A notable example of this policy is the Public Health Act, 1875, whereby most extensive powers are given to Urban and Rural Sanitary Authorities, but where Parliament, wisely, in my judgment, refrained from indicating what committee should be appointed to assist in their performance.  ,&quot;I am aware that more recently Parliament has in some cases interfered with the discretion of local authorities in the appointment of Committees, either by direct enactment or by requiring the approval of schemes by a central department. Personally, I think that this is a mistake and I trust that the practice will riot be extended.&quot;In the present case it is, in my opinion, sufficient to transfer the functions of the Poor Law Authorities to the councils of County Boroughs with such modifications and extensions as are desirable (the modifications consisting largely, I trust, of the removal of: unnecessary central control) and to empower the councils in performing these functions to make use of their existing statutory committees (for example, the asylums and education committees), and to appoint such other committees as they may think necessary. If this course is not adopted, not only will unnecessary difficulties be placed in the way of councils in the performance of onerous duties, hut there is the real fear that the new statutory committees, and particularly the home assistance committees, will be regarded as the old Poor Law Authority under a new name.&quot;. 14. Mr. Pritchard&apos;s reservation was fully endorsed, and indeed amplified, by the Association of Municipal Corporations in a Report of their Law Committee which was adopted by their Council in January, 1919, and there is no reason to doubt that the County Councils would take the same view. It must be recognised therefore that it would provoke the almost united opposition of the Local Authorities to insist that the actual machinery of administration should be prescribed by statute.15. A consideration of these various difficulties seems to point to the conclusion that the better plan would be to approach the problem by two stages and to make a beginning with a transference of administrative powers alone, postponing the unification of services until actual experience of a system of unified administration leads to a spontaneous movement in the direction of unifying the services. This plan is perhaps open to the criticism that it would, for the time being at any rate, leave intact the Poor Law system and the Poor Law principles which it is the chief object of the reformers to abolish, and it will probably be desirable therefore to include in the Bill sonle provision for securing the gradual unification of services.16. It is accordingly suggested that the Ministry of Health should frame model schemes and that the Bill should require the Local Authorities to submit their schemes to the Ministry for confirmation, such schemes to be subject to revision after experience of their actual working.Unemployment and Home Assistance Committees.17. Having dealt with the sick and infirm, the children, and the lunatics in the manner above described, the Maclean Committee proposed the appointment of two new statutory committees, viz., &quot; The Prevention of Unemployment and Training Committee &quot; and &quot; The Home Assistance Committee.&quot; In view of the far-reaching changes which have been made in. the treatment of unemployment since the Maclean Committee reported there would appear to be no need to provide in the scheme for the setting up of the first of these two additional committees, and as regards the second there is point in Mr. Pritchard&apos;s objection, quoted in para-graph 13 of this Memorandum, that a new statutory committee of this kind would be regarded as the old Poor Law Authority under another name. It is proposed therefore to exclude from, the Bill any explicit provision for the appointment of either of these two committees. ;Able-bodied Unemployed.18. Strong arguments will doubtless, be advanced in favour of taking tbe treatment of the able-bodied unemployed out of the Poor Law altogether, and o
handing this class over to the Ministry of Labour or some. other Government Department. .19. This was in effect a recommendation of the Minority Report of the Royal Commission, but it. was also proposed, though on different grounds, by the County Councils Association in the scheme which they drew up in 1911 after the issue of the Royal Commission&apos;s Reports. -   .20. The position has, of course, been radically altered by the development and recent extension of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, and what appears to be most needed at the present time is the establishment, whether by Statute or by Regulation, of some well defined scheme for relating the system of Unemployment Insurance to the assistance that may be given to the able-bodied by the successors to the Poor Law Guardians.21. The scheme of unemployment benefit as amended by the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1st August, 1924, is sufficient, in all ordinary cases, to keep the unemployed worker in the insured trades and his dependants from destitution; but it remains open to the local Poor Law Authority to grant out-door relief in addition to the benefit, or even in cases where benefit has been stopped owing to refusal of suitable work. If any further amendments in the unemployment benefit scheme are necessary in order to cover the case of the able-bodied unemployed (e.g., by its extension to agriculture) these should be considered;, but it is of the greatest importance to secure proper co-ordination with the assistance given directly out of public funds, and in any comprehensive scheme that may be adopted there should be a definite limitation of the powers of the successors of the Poor Law Authorities to grant out-door relief to the able-bodied unemployed. More detailed proposals under this head will be found in the Appendix to this Memorandum.Position,of the Minor Local Authorities.22. One of the most troublesome questions to determine, will be that of the relative positions, especially in the matter of health functions, of the County Councils and the minor authorities within the County.23. There is no doubt that the County Borough Council is the most convenient body to take over the whole of the functions of the Guardians in such an area, but it is doubtful whether a similar wholesale transfer to the County Councils, ignoring the non-county boroughs, would be expedient: The County Council is not the public health authority in the borough, and where the population of a borough at the Census of 1901 was 10,000 or upwards, the County Council is not the local authority for elementary education. Similarly, the Councils of urban districts with a population at the Census of 1901 of 20,000 or upwards are local authorities for elementary education.24. The councils of all boroughs and of all urban and rural districts are the executive health authorities for their areas. They deal with the prevention and treatment of infectious disease (including the maintenance of hospitals for infectious disease) and the prevention or removal of&apos; insanitary conditions in the home or elsewhere. For these purposes, the councils employ medical officers of health and medical superintendents of infectious hospitals,: sanitary inspectors and other officers. They also in many cases administer maternity and child welfare services. It should be noted that sanatoria for tuberculosis are provided by the councils of counties and county boroughs not by the councils of non-county boroughs and other district councils. .   .25. Under the present system, the Boards of Guardians maintain infirmaries and special wards in workhouses for the sick and infirm, and have a staff of district medical officers by whom the sick poor are attended in their homes. They are only concerned with the prevention and treatment of infectious disease (including tuberculosis) in cases where a want of accommodation or some other reason prevents the patient being received into a hospital for infectious&apos;disease or sanatorium, or where the patient is already in receipt of some other form of relief from the guardians.26. The question whether the duties of the Boards of Guardians in the treatment of the sick and infirm should pass to the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs, or whether the Councils of Non-County Boroughs and Urban and Rural Districts should be recognised as a more appropriate destination by reason of their existing powers in relation to public health, is a difficult one.. The former course was recommended by the Maclean Committee, and its adoption would bring within reach of attainment the ideal of a single health authority for each local area.   But
the vastly different conditions prevailing in different counties, the unequal degree of desire and capacity for extended activities in different County Councils the existing health machinery of the minor local authorities and their inevitable hostility to any plan which would aggrandise the county councils at their expense, are factors in the situation which cannot be ignored, and if friction and overlapping are to be avoided some provision must be made for the distribution of some of the transferred functions among the lesser local authorities. If this be conceded the choice would seem to lie between (a) a primary transfer of all the Guardians&apos; functions and institutions to the County Councils, coupled with a power of delegation bv the County Councils to the minor authorities, and (6) the plan of requiring each county council to frame, after consultation with the minor authorities, a scheme for the allocation among them of the functions and institutions transferred from the Guardians. The position of the County Councils would of course be stronger and their responsibilities greater under the first than under the second of these alternatives and for that reason the first would meet with more opposition from the non-county boroughs, urban and rural districts than the second, but it would have the advantage of more clearly enunciating the ultimate ideal to be aimed at. In either case the approval of the Minister of Health would be requisite, and it would be advisable that any such scheme, whether of delegation or: of allocation, should be of a tem-porary and provisional nature, and subject to reconsideration and modification in the light of experience of its actual working or in consequence of subsequent legislation. The two alternatives are both set out in the Appendix.27. The question remains whether the minor authority should be charged with financial responsibility in respect of any functions allocated or delegated to it under an approved scheme. The main arguments in favour of the retention of full responsi-bility by the County Council are that at least a minimum standard of efficiency is more likely to be thereby maintained without any intervention on the part of the Central Authority, and that if there appears to be a falling off from this standard the Central Authority can more effectively intervene to secure its restoration by representations made to one County Council than by simultaneous representations to the partially responsible County Council and to one or more minor authorities.28. On the other hand it is a fundamental principle that chargeability should not be divorced from administration, so that the working of a service should in every instance carry with it responsibility for financing it from the resources of the administering authority. Only so can proper supervision be expected of the daily acts of administration of which the cumulative effect is to produce either a reasonable or an extravagant expenditure; and economy can only be fostered in an authority fully responsible for any service upon which it is authorised to spend money.29. The conclusion therefore must, it would seem, be in favour of making the minor authority financially responsible for the cost of exercising any functions which are allocated to it under a scheme.Combinations of Local Authorities. 30. Several of the counties are of small extent and it may be found necessary to allow county councils to combine for all or any of the purposes of the Bill, subject to the approval of the Minister of Health, the administration, in such a case, being entrusted to a joint committee of the county councils in combination. Similarly, it would be advisable to allow a county borough council to combine with an adjoining county council or with an adjoining county borough council. It often happens that a poor law union comprises not only a county borough but a portion of the adjoining county, and the Bill, without a provision of this kind, would in -such a case, decrease instead of enlarging the area of administration and charge.Co-option.31. The Maclean Committee proposed that any Committee through whom any functions transferred to the Town or County Council from the Poor Law Authorities are to be administered should include men and women and representatives of bodies (not being members of the Town or County Council) possessing experience of various kinds in the work to be done, and in the first instance persons who have been members of a Poor Law Authority. They further proposed that the Prevention of Unamploy-ment Committee should include representatives of Employers&apos; Associations ana o Organised Labour. ..32. There is no doubt that the County and Municipal Councils would  md w difficult adequately to discharge the additional functions proposed to be transfer!e
to them without an enlargement of the membership of their committees; but it is well known that the Local Authorities generally are opposed to the principle of co-option, and if it is retained it would be well to make it purely optional.Allocation of Property and Liabilities oe Poor Law Authorities among the Councils concerned.33. This will be a matter of considerable difficulty. In a large number of cases the present Union area does not coincide with or lie wholly within the area of any administrative county or borough; institutions are frequently situated outside the area of the Union to which they belong; in some instances institutions are the joint property of a combination of Unions; certain Unions are well equipped with modern institutions, while others possess only an old fashioned workhouse; in some cases the Councils concerned will be in great need of additional institutions, in others they will already be in possession of as many institutions as they can economically administer. Similar questions will arise in regard to the allocation of the existing staffs of the Poor Law Authorities.34. It may be necessary where local agreement cannot be secured to appoint temporary Commissioners to make the requisite allocations and adjustments of the transferred properties, liabilities, and staff, but this should, if possible, be avoided, and the duty entrusted to the Minister of Health, who would receive reports, usually after local inquiries, from the General (Poor Law) Inspectors.Grants in Aid.35.

(.8) to (12) (totalling to about  2,127,000 a year) are payable to Boards of Guardians by the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs out of their Exchequer Contribution Accounts, i.e., out of revenues assigned to those Councils by the Local Government Act, 1888, and subsequent Acts.(8) Variable grant towards the remuneration of teachers in poor law schools, and in recoupment of the school fees paid for children sent from a workhouse to a public elementary school.(9) Fixed grant towards cost of remuneration paid to registrars of births and deaths in respect of certain services rendered by them.(10) Pauper lunatic grant. Variable grant equivalent to 4s. a week for each pauper lunatic, chargeable to a union and maintained in an asylum, for whom the net charge on the Guardians is equal to or exceeds 4s. a week.As- a temporary war measure . the amount of this grant to each Union was stereotyped, as regards unions in London by section 9 of the Local Govern-ment (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916,&quot; and as regards other unions, by the Local Government Emergency Provisions (No.-2) Act, 1916. The.amount stereotyped is equivalent to the amount of the grant actually paid in respect of the year ended 31s March, 1915 (1916 outside London). This stereotyping has been continued annually by the Expiring Law Continuance Act.
(11) Fixed grant based on the costs in the. year 1888 of the officers of unions and poor law school districts outside London.(12) Variable grant to unions in London equivalent to one-half the current remuneration of poor law lnedical officers and one-half the current cost of drugs and medical appliances. &apos;. ,The grants numbered (8), (9) and (10) above may be &quot;abated&quot; if the sums standing to the credit of the appropriate Exchequer Contribution Account.is not sufficient to meet in full all the charges on the Account. The grants.numbered (11) and (12) are payable to the Guardians in full even in cases where&apos; the amount standing to the credit of the Exchequer Contribution Account of a County or County Borough Council may not be-sufficient to meet the payment in full; in such cases, any deficiency is made good out of the appropriate county or borough fund.(13) Grant to public vaccinators. This grant is not payable directly to Boards of Guardians, but is payable out of the Exchequer Contribution Accounts directly to public vaccinators, who are appointed and whose salaries are paid by those Boards. It amounts to about  10,000 a year.(14) In addition to the grants mentioned above, there is payble to Boards of Guardians in London, by the London County Council, out of the county fund, a fixed annual grant equivalent to fourpence a day per head on the average number of indoor paupers maintained by the Guardians during the five years ended 25th March, 1888. [This grant, which amounts to about  327,000 a year and is provided for by Section 43 (1) (b) of the Local Government Act, 1888, has in recent years been met wholly out of the county rate and has, in fact, become merely one of several contrivances for imposing upon the &quot;richer&quot; unions in London costs incurred by the &quot; poorer &quot; unions therein].37. A reform of the present relations between Imperial and Local Taxation lias long been felt to be overdue. It is 24 years since the Royal Commission on Local Taxation made Reports to this effect after a searching examination of the law and practice then prevailing in relation to the financial assistance given by the Exchequer to local authorities. It is nine years since the Departmental Committee on Local Taxation, commonly known as the Kempe Committee, made its Report, and since a Finance Bill designed to give effect to the conclusions of the Government then in office was introduced in the House of Commons.38. The War intervened to prevent further consideration of this matter, but any proposals for the reform of the Poor Law and the consequent readjustment of Local Government functions and for the reform of the Rating and Valuation system will most probably revive the question whether the Government should not, concurrently with the other reforms, propose some equitable settlement of the conditions under which local authorities receive financial assistance for the administration of what are sometimes called the &quot; semi-national &quot; services which are entrusted to them.39. The Ministry of Health would themselves favour a drastic scheme of Reform, involving the abolition of the Assigned Revenues System (including the grants under the Agricultural Rates Act and Tithe Rentcharge (Rates) Act) and the substitution for the existing Health and Poor Law grants of a block grant for Health Services to be apportioned among the local authorities in accordance with a formula laid down by statute or prescribed by regulation, and if it is thought desirable to explore this proposal further the Ministry of Health will be prepared to produce a detailed scheme for the purpose.40. If, however, it is considered that a radical reform of this nature would overweight the Poor Law Reform Scheme, or for other reasons cannot be undertaken at the present time, it will be necessary to devise some temporary scheme for readjusting and reallocating the grants at present paid to Poor Law Authorities.41. A scheme for a temporary readjustment of this nature is included in theAppendix. mi&amp;m      u :.;v,Kft Woiv:; m :v\  -42. To induce the local authorities to accept new responsibilities in virtue of their exercise of functions previously assigned to other bodies, it may be necessary to propose some increase in the amount of the present aggregate grants. If it were possible to-Undertake a radical reform oL&apos;the; existing system of Grants in Aid on the lines indicated in paragraph 39 of this i Memorandum, thb Ministry of HealthC 2
would propose a substantial block grant in aid of Health Services generally. If, however, the temporary readjustment suggested is adopted, it would be found desirable for administrative reasons, and would no doubt satisfy the demand for additional assistance, if the new expenditure incurred as regards the destitute in the present state-aided services were to be allowed to rank for financial assistance. The present state-aided services affected would be Education, Maternity and Child Welfare, Tuberculosis, Mental Deficiency, and Venereal Disease. It is estimated roughly that the additional grants which would be payable would amount to at least  1,500,000 per annum.Settlement and Removal.43. If, as proposed in this Scheme, the Poor Law Acts are not repealed, the law of Settlement and Removal would, unless an exception is made in this particular case, remain in force. The retention of the law of Settlement may appear an anomaly under a reformed system, for it is, of course, characteristic of the Poor Law alone and has no application to the case of other services. On the other hand, the substitution of Counties and County Boroughs for the Union as the Poor Law area of the future would largely neutralise both the purpose of the law and its attendant evils. It is a rather nice question therefore whether it would be better to repeal what would in the future be an anomalous law, or to allow it to remain in order to avoid the controversy which its proposed abolition would excite.44. There would seem thus to be three possible courses, viz. : (a) to omit any reference in the Bill to settlement and removal, allowing the present law to continue in operation subject to the consequential changes resulting from the alteration of the area;(6) to provide for the entire abolition of the law; and (c) to follow the recommendation of the Majority of the Royal Commis-sion, and, while making the County and the County Borough the unit, to reduce the eight existing forms of settlement to four, viz., birth, parentage, marriage, and residence.45. Inasmuch as practical and political considerations suggest the necessity of keeping the Bill within the narrowest possible compass, the first of these courses appears to be preferable, and accordingly no provision for dealing with this matter is included in the appended Scheme.Poor Law Orders.46. The present Poor Law Orders, many of which would have to be revised even if the Boards of Guardians remained, would be ill-adapted to the new system and inappropriate to the new type of authority. It will be necessary therefore for the Ministry of Health to undertake a complete revision of the Orders, particularly in the direction of reducing the close control which the Central Authority have maintained over the Boards of Guardians and the Poor Law Officers. It would seem, however, that the Bill need not provide for this, or at most that it would be sufficient to say that the Minister of Health shall revise the Orders (perhaps &quot; after consultation with Associations of the Local Authorities concerned &quot;).Application to London.47. The Majority and Minority of the Royal Commission upon the Poor Law agreed in effect upon the following principles of reform in respect to London, namely : -(1) That the expenses connected with the relief of the poor should he raised by an equal rate over the whole county. n     i(2) That the administration should be placed in the hands of one Central Body for the whole of London, aided by local committees. ,(3) That all the Boards of Guardians in the county should be abolished (4) That it was inexpedient to set up in London a new Central Body the purpose of Poor Law only. ,There was, however, a difference of opinion as to what should be the CentaW&apos; The Majority recommended the institution of a statutory committee of the Lou j
Council which should consist of between 50 and 60 members appointed partly by the County Council and partly by the Local Government Board. The Minority proposed that the County Council itself should be the authority.48. The Maclean Committee recommended that the functions of the Boards of Guardians, of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and of the Managers of Sick Asylums and Poor Law Schools in London should be divided between the County Council and the Borough Councils in accordance with a scheme to be framed by the County Council after consultation with the Borough Councils. The Maclean Committee further recommended that the scheme should be framed on the following hues : In each borough a Home Assistance Committee should be appointed by the Borough Council &quot; on the lines of an Education Committee, and generally in a similar relation to the appointing Council,&quot; and the Borough Council, acting through its Home Assistance Committee, was to be charged with the administration of out-relief. The County Council, acting through a Central Assistance Committee, was to be charged with the duty of laying down a policy and rules of local administration for the exercise of the functions allocated to the Home Assistance Committee of the Borough council, and with the duty of securing at their discretion suitable institutional treatment for cases recommended by the Home Assistance Committees of the Borough Councils. Institutions transferred from the Poor Law Authorities were to be appropriated by the County Council, as they thought fit, for the purposes of any functions exerciseable by them, and were to be administered as follows : (a) Institutions for the sick, the aged, maternity cases and infants,through the Public Health Committee of the County Council.(6) Schools  for  normally  healthy  children through  the   education committee.(c) Other institutions for such children and institutions for other classes of children through such committee, other than the Central Assistance Committee, as the County Council might in each case determine.(d) Institutions for persons of unsound mind or for mental defectives through the Asylums and Mental Deficiency Committee.The expenses of Home Assistance in each borough were to be subject to the control of the Finance Committee of the Borough Council and to be charged to the general rate of the borough, provided that where the County Council were satisfied that (a) an adequate and suitable staff was appointed, and (6) the administration was conducted efficiently, economically, and on approved principles, the County Council should repay to the borough council two-thirds of the expenses properly incurred wdthin an approved estimate. The expenses of assistance borne centrally should include (a) the proportion of local expenses repaid to the borough councils, (6) the cost of central administration under the scheme, whether incurred through the Central Assistance Committee, the Prevention of Unemployment and Training Committee, or otherwise and (c) the cost of institutional assistance and training. Any grants which might be made from the National Exchequer in aid of services included in the scheme to be paid to the County Council.49. The London County Council in December, 1918, approved generally the fundamental principles laid down in the Maclean Committee&apos;s Report. In December, 1919, the County Council agreed to a Report on Health Administration in London, in which, among other proposals, it was recommended that a scheme for the better organisation of Health Services in London should provide, inter alia, that the Health functions of London Poor Law Authorities should be divided between the Council, the City Corporation, and the Borough Councils substantially on the basis proposed by the Maclean Committee. They supported these proposals in a deputation which was received by the then Minister of Health in April, 1920, and they reaffirmed their adherence to these proposals and to the scheme of the Maclean Committee in the evidence which they submitted to Lord Ullswater&apos;s Royal Corn-mission on London Government in 1922. The only proposal made by the County Council which was not in complete agreement with the recommendations of the Maclean Report was that the local authorities, that is the borough councils, should administer the institutions which would be required for the sole use of patients from the local areas, e.g., infirmaries, maternity hospitals under local schemes, local homes for advanced cases of tuberculosis, etc.50. In view of the explicit and reiterated endorsement by the County Council of the Maclean Committee&apos;s scheme there is some difficulty in proposing any
substantial departure from that scheme. Nevertheless there appears to be a strong case for making one important departure from the Maclean Committee&apos;s scheme, It is obvious that a transfer of out-relief administration from the Boards of Guardians to the Metropolitan Borough Councils would do little towards solving the particular problem which has brought the question of London Poor Law again to the fore-front. In Poplar the borough council and the Board of Guardians are actuated by the same policy and are indeed largely identical in personnel and it is not very likely that the borough council would prove itself more amenable to the control of the London County Council, than the Guardians have been to the control of the Ministry of Health.51. Accordingly the better plan might be to place the whole administration in the hands of the London County Council, out-relief, or Home Assistance as it is called by the Maclean Committee, being entrusted to local committees of the County Council, which, however, might be partly composed of representatives of the borough councils. If this proposal is adopted it would follow that the whole of the expenses connected with the relief of the poor would be borne centrally as expenses of the County Council.52. It is further suggested, and in this the County Council would probably agree, that, in order to avoid a multiplication of statutory committees to whom specified duties stand automatically referred, the Council should frame and submit to the Minister of Health for approval a scheme for the administration of all the transferred functions. The adoption of this suggestion would bring the London proposals into line with the proposals already indicated for the provincial counties.SUMMARY OP THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH DECISIONS OF THE CABINET COMMITTEE ARE REQUIRED.1. Should the recommendations of the Maclean Committee as to the &quot; break-up &quot; of the Poor Law and the unification of the transferred services be adopted, or should a beginning be made with a transference of administrative powers alone, in which case the Poor Law would be preserved, subject only to such modifications as may be required by the change of authorities, and the new authorities would be free, under the general direction of the Ministry of Health, to work out their own schemes for the performance of the transferred functions ?2. Should definite steps be taken, on the lines suggested in the Appendix to the Memorandum, for securing the proper co-ordination of Poor Law Belief and Unemployment Benefit and the limitation of the powers of the new Poor Law Authorities in regard to the granting of relief ?3. What is to be the position of the minor local authorities under the new arrangements ? * Should there be a primary transfer of all the Guardians&apos; functions and institutions to the County Councils, coupled with a power of delegation by the County Councils to the minor local authorities, or should the plan be adopted of requiring each County Council to frame, after consultation with the minor local authorities, a scheme for the allocation among them of the functions and institutions transferred from the Guardians ?4. Should the new authorities be (a) required or (6) empowered to co-opt persons who are not members of the authorities to assist in the discharge of the new duties.5. What arrangements should be made for the distribution of the property and liabilities of the Guardians between the new authorities ?6. What is to take the place of the present Grants-in-Aid now paid to the Poor Law Authorities ? Should there be a drastic scheme of reform, involving the abolition of the Assigned Revenues system, or should there be merely a temporary readjustment of the present subventions ? And can provision be made for additional grants ?7. Should the present law of Settlement be repealed or modified ?8. In the application to London, should the scheme proposed by the Maclean Committee be adopted or should it be modified in the direction of centralising moie powers. and duties in the County Council ?
APPENDIX.SUMMARY OP PROPOSALS.I. Abolition of Boards of Guardians and Transfer of Functions.As from the appointed day the Boards of Guardians to be abolished, and, subject to the various modifications hereinafter referred to, their powers and duties to be transferred to the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs.[Notes. (a) It will be necessary to take power to appoint different days for different purposes or for different provisions of the Act. -   !&apos; (b) Throughout this Summary the expression &quot; Boards of Guardians &quot; includes, unless the context otherwise requires, Joint Committees of Boards of Guardians,. Managers of School Districts,, and other Poor Law Authorities; and the power and duties of the Boards of Guardians which are transferred are referred to as &quot;transferred functions.&quot;(c) It is a question whether the &quot;Poor Law Union&quot; should be abolished. Assuming that the Poor Law Acts are not repealed, it would presumably be necessary, and might be sufficient, to provide that references to the Poor Law Union area should be read as if the words &quot; county &quot; or &quot; borough &quot; or &quot; district,&quot; as the case may be, were substituted therefor.(d) It will be remembered that the Draft Rating and Valuation Bill includes provisions for the abolition of Overseers. If the Rating and Valuation Bill is passed before the Poor Law Reform Bill there will be no need to deal with this question in the latter Bill; but it is merely a matter of convenience in which of the two Bills the provisions relating to Overseers should be included.]II. Allocation of transferred functions between County CouNcrL and Minor Authorities.Where in any borough (not being a county borough) or district, the, borough council or district council administer a service for persons other than destitute persons, the County Council, before the appointed day, to submit to the Minister of Health proposals for the delegation to the borough or district council of such of the transferred functions, as regards destitute persons in the borough or district, as may be covered by the service administered by the borough or district council and if the Minister approves of the proposals, the borough or district council to be responsible for administering the transferred functions so delegated, subject, nevertheless, to the general supervision of the County Council and to the power of that Council to take action where a borough or district council neglect or refuse to exercise their powers as regards destitute persons.Alternative A.As soon as may be after the passing of the Act, the Council of every County, after consultation with the councils of the non-county boroughs, urban districts, and rural districts within the county, to prepare and submit to the Minister of Health a scheme for the allocation of the transferred functions between the council of the county and the other councils, and the Minister, after giving any of the councils concerned an opportunity of appealing against the proposed scheme, to approve such scheme -with or without modification.If the council of any county fail to submit such a scheme within [twelve] months after the passing of the Act, the Minister may himself make a scheme.[Notes. (a) It may be necessary to provide that the scheme should be in accordance with Regulations made by the Minister and to take power to make such Regulations. In view of the extraordinary diversity in the circumstances of the different counties, this should be avoided if possible; but the Minister would, no doubt, issue a Circular containing an outline of a model scheme.(b) These schemes should probably be of temporary duration and subject to revision from time to time or after a fixed period.(c) The term &quot; allocation &quot; is used here to cover a variety of possible plans, e.g., a complete transfer of responsibility to the minor authorities or some of them, or a transfer subject to supervision by the county council, or a mere delegation.]III. Combinations of Local Authorities. Any county council or county borough council to be allowed to combine with the council of any county or county borough for all or any of the purposes of the Dill, subject to the approval of the Minister of Health, and to appoint a joint committee for the exercise of the powers transferred by the Bill.IV. Expenses under a County Scheme. Any expenses incurred by a borough or district council, in the discharge of functions delegated to them by the County Council under proposals approved by the Minister of Health, to be borne by the borough or district council, and the borough or district to be exempt from contributing to the expenses incurred by the County Council in the remainder of the county for the like purposes, but any expenses incurred by the County Council on a default of the borough or district council to be repaid by that council to the County Council. Subject to the above provisions, any expenses incurred by a County Council in the exercise of the transferred functions to be raised from the whole of the county.Alternative A (following on the adoption of Alternative A in Clause II. of this Summary).Where any functions are transferred to the Council of a non-county borough or urban or rural district in pursuance of an approved county scheme any expenses incurred in the discharge of such functions to be defrayed by the council to whom they are so transferred (? provided that if the scheme provides for the delegation of any functions subject to county council supervision, in lieu of an actual transfer, such proportion of the expenses as may be determined by the approved scheme to be borne oy the county council). ,
V. Committees of Local Authorities. The Council of every County and of every County Borough and the Council of any Borough District within a county to whom functions are transferred in pursuance of a county scheme approved by the Minister under Clause II. of this Summary (each of which Councils is hereinafter referred to as th &quot; Local Authority &quot;) may appoint a special committee or committees for the purpose of performing anv of the transferred functions which cannot conveniently be assigned to any of the existing committees of the Council.Alternative A.The Local Authority shall within [ ] months after the passing of the Act submit to theMinister of Health a scheme for apportioning the transferred functions among the committees of the Local Authority, whether existing committees or committees to be specially appointed for this purposeAlternative B.The local authority shall either, after obtaining the consent of the Minister, submit to the Minister a scheme apportioning the duties assigned to the local authority under this Act among the committees of the local authority (whether existing committees or committees to be specially appointed) or shaJJ assign (i) to the Public Health Committee, the prevention and treatment of sickness, vaccination, and the registration of births, deaths and marriages;(ii) to the Committee for the Care of the Mentally Defective, the treatment of mental disability except so far as mental disability in children is concerned;(iii) to the education committee, the education and care and maintenance where maintenance in a residential school is considered&apos; desirable in the interests of the children, of children for whose maintenance or care and maintenance the local authority is required to provide and the apprenticeship, emigration, or other placing out of all such children.(iv) to a committee to be appointed as hereinafter prescribed and known as the Home Assistance Committee : (a) the maintenance or care and maintenance of children and of persons and their dependants for whose maintenance or care and maintenance the local authority is required to provide;(6) infant life protection;(c) consideration of representations that the local authority is required to provide maintenanceor care and maintenance in any particular case and the reference of any case to the appropriate committee of the local authority;(d) inquiring into the economic circumstances of persons hi respect of whom, or of whosedependants, it is represented that the local authority is by this Act required to provide maintenance or care and maintenance, and of persons for whom any expense so incurred by a local authority is recoverable, and recovery of any reasonable expenditure;(e) general supervision of all persons for whom maintenance or care and maintenance isprovided by the local authority; (/) registration of all cases in which treatment, care, or maintenance is provided by the loeai authority.Provided that the responsibility of the committee as regards the maintenance or care and maintenance of any individual shall not extend to any period during which that responsibility lias been accepted by some other committee of the local authority.[Notes. (a) Alternative B is included for the purpose of showing the kind of provision which would be required to give full effect to the Maclean Committee&apos;s recommendations. The practical objections to this proposal are described in paragraphs 11 to 14 of the covering Memorandum. Alternative A represents a compromise between this proposal and what the Local Authorities would probably prefer.(6) If either A or B were adopted, it would probably be desirable to provide that the schemes should be subject to revision from time to time or after a fixed period.]VI. Power to Co-opt Additional Members oe Committees. The Local Authority may, if they thirds; fit, appoint as members of any special committee, appointed for the purpose of performing any transferred functions, persons who are not members of the local Authority.[Notes. (a) It will be observed that this power is purely optional.(6) It is a question whether the power of appointing as members of committees persons who are not members of the Local Authority should be extended to the case of any existing committee to which transferred functions are assigned. If this were done, care would be needed to make such a provision fit in properly with the existing provisions relating to the constitution of Education Committees.(c) The Maclean Report recommended that any Committee through whom any transferred i unctions are administered should include men and women and representatives of bodies (not being members ot the Council) possessing experience of various kinds in the work to be done, and in the first instance persons who have been members of a Poor Law Authority. It is thought, however, that it would be bettei to leave the Local Authorities an entirely free hand.]VII. Scheme iron linking up Unemployment Insurance with Relief to. the Able-bodied. (1) Scope of Extended Insurance Scheme,   (a) Periods of Benefit. Subject to proof of payment of a small number of contributions within a recent period (say, 30 contributions in the last two insurance years) benefit would be payable without limit of time.   In order, however, to facilitate scrutiny o
claims, there should be a first period of what may be called &quot; standard &quot; benefit in some prescribed ratio to the credit of contributions, to be followed by a period of &quot;extended&quot; benefit under more stringent conditions.(b) General conditions governing payment of benefit. The title to standard benefit would depend on a credit of contributions and apart from this no special conditions would be necessary beyond those ordinarily applicable to unemployment benefit.For extended benefit there should be in addition certain special conditions designed to test whether the claimant is a genuine industrial worker in the insured trades, such as those set out in the August 1924 U.I. Act, viz., that the claimant should prove : (a) that he is normally employed in such employment as would make him an employed person within the meaning of the principal Act (in this Act referred to as &quot; insurable employment&quot;), and will normally seek to obtain his livehhood by means of insurable employment;(b) that in normal times insurable employment suited to his capacities would be likely to be available for him;(c) that he has, during the two years immediately preceding the date of the application for benefit, been employed in an insurable employment to such an extent as was reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case and in particular to the opportunities for obtaining insurable employment during that period;(d) that he is making every reasonable effort to obtain employment suited to his capacities and is willing to accept such employment.In deciding on claims for extended benefit use should be made of the local knowledge and standing of the L.E.C&apos;s.(c) Rates of Benefit. The object to be kept in view should be the relief of destitution and not the provision of full subsistence. For this purpose the existing rates are considered adequate to meet normal family needs.(d) Scope of benefits. Agriculture, an employment subject to all the usual industrial risks, should be brought within the scheme and there should be an extension of the scope of dependants&apos; grants to embrace all children under 16, whether children of the worker, or not, actually maintained by a worker while he is in employment.It is recognised that the exclusion of domestic service leaves an important section of the employed population uncovered by a special scheme. It is considered, however, that the political difficulties involved in any attempt to include domestic service would be insuperable and that even if they could be overcome, the administrative problems which the inclusion of domestic service would create might jeopardise the efficient working of the whole scheme.(2) Co-ordination of extended Insurance scheme with the transferred Poor Law services. The work of Local Employment Committees and of the Committees discharging transferred Poor Law functions should be co-ordinated by the interchange of members between the Committees by co-option, or by other suitable means, which could be left to the local authority.(3) Limitation of poivers of Local Authorities in respect of relief to employed persons and their dependants. (i) Local Authorities should be precluded by statute from granting out-door relief to any persons or to the dependants of any person within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, save (possibly) in certain cases set out below. In the case of persons within the scope of the Unemploy-ment Insurance Scheme who are able to work and are suffering from no medical disability, assistance should only be granted after benefit has been withheld, e.g., from persons who have failed to show that they are genuinely seeking work, subject to a labour test, or, possibly, should be refused altogether. The existing statutory responsibility of the Poor Law Authorities to prevent a person starving to death must, however, be retained.Exceptions to this prohibition in respect of insured persons and their dependants might be admitted in the ease of out-relief granted in the following circumstances : To assist in the payment of rent.To relieve special needs arising out of sickness, disablement or mental infirmity (see paragraph below relating to position of sick, &amp;c, members of households of insured workers).To relieve dependants of persons within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme who have accepted institutional relief on refusal of a claim to insurance benefit.To give relief in land, possibly limited in amount, to meet cases of exceptional hardship, such as the special needs of children in very large families.(ii) The relief granted to persons outside the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme should not exceed in amount the benefit for persons within the scope of the scheme, and the exceptional grants permissible in respect of such persons.(4) Independent sphere of the Local Authorities -The Local Authority would continue to deal I exclusively with the needs of the following classes of persons (in addition to the classes mentioned inI (i) above) :  -1. Persons outside the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme and their Dependants;2. The sick and disabled (dealt with to some extent under the Health Insurance Scheme) mentally infirm, &amp;c, of all classes including insured persons under the Unemployed Insurance Scheme and the dependants of such persons.(5) Position of Sick, Disabled, &amp;c, Members of the household of an Insured worker. It has been suggested that all the needs of members of a household supported by an insured worker, whatever their nature, should be met during the unemployment of the bread-winner by a single authority the authority responsible for granting unemployment benefit mainly out of funds formed by contributions under
the Insurance Scheme and State subventions. It is considered, however, that a sub-division of functions on these lines between the Unemployment Authority and the Public Assistance Authority would not be practicable for the following reasons : (1) The proper authority to deal with needs due to sickness disablement, mental infirmity, &amp;c, is the authority which controls the machinery required for treating the needs, namely, the Public Assistance Authority. Due discrimination in such cases by the Unemployment Authority would be administratively impracticable without a large specialised staff.(2) No good case has been made out for so extensive a transfer of the financial burden of the relief of local need from local funds to the National Exchequer as would be involved in the proposal.(3) The application of employers&apos; contributions to the Insurance Funds to such a purpose as the provision of medical treatment for the dependants of employed persons would probably arouse opposition and might lead to an attack on the application of such contributions towards the payment of dependants&apos; grants (as under the existing scheme). It might be held with some justice that the necessary contributions placed an unfair burden on industry.For these reasons it is considered that sick and disabled members of the family of an insured worker should at all times be dealt with by the Public Assistance Authority.To sum up, the position of the various members of the household of an insured worker under the proposals contained in the memorandum would be broadly as follows : (1) All children actually dependent under 14 (or 16 in certain circumstances) would he covered directly by the Insurance Scheme while in normal health.(2) Insured members of the household over 16 would be treated as independent workers.(3) Non-insured members normally in employment or otherwise earning income would when out of work, be dealt with by the Public Assistance Authority.(4) Non-insured members whether able-bodied or infirm not normally in employment or otherwise earning income (other than a wife (or invalid husband) or housekeeper) could not be made the basis of a claim for additional Unemployment Insurance Benefit during the unemploy-ment of the head of the household, even though, in fact, they were normally dependent. Such persons could obtain assistance only from the Public Assistance Authority.(5) All members of the household falling sick or prevented by physical or mental infirmity from earning a living by independent effort would be dealt with under the Health Insurance Scheme or by the Public Assistance Authority.VIII. Repeal of Unemployed Workmen Act.The Unemployed Workmen Act, 1905, to be repealed, and all distress committees and central bodies constituted under the provisions of that Act to be abolished and their property and liabilities transferred to the Local Authorities.[Notes.-(1) The Unemployed Workmen Act has found no place in the unemployment programme of any Government since the Armistice, and there is no prospect of it being resuscitated. It is in fact, obsolete and should be repealed. -(2) Under the Unemployed Workmen Act, 1905, and the Orders made thereunder by the Local Government Board, 29 Distress Committees were set up in the City and County of London and 105 in other parts of the country. In four cases Orders have been revoked, so that now there are 130 Distress Committees nominally in existence.In some cases Distress Committees have recently been disbanded, and their unexpended balances returned to the Ministry or otherwise disposed of; in other cases Distress Committees have not been appointed for years; and in other cases where Distress Committees have been appointed they are not working, and during recent years have not been functioning in any way. Some, e.g., of the Metropolitan Distress Committees, have been appointed merely in order that they might elect representatives on the Central (Unemployed) Body for London.It appears probable that, except in the cases of the Central (Unemployed) Body and of West Ham, in which some special arrangements might be necessary, the only problems &quot;which would arise, if Distress Committees were abolished, would be as to an officer or two in perhaps half a dozen cases. Most of these could and would doubtless be transferred to other work under the town or district council concerned.]IX.-Assessment and Rating. If the Rating and Valuation Bill is passed before the Poor Law Reform Bill, the provisions of the former Bill in regard to the constitution of Assessment Committees will need some modification in consequence of the proposed abolition of the Boards of Guardians. These modifications could, however, be effected in the Poor Law Bill. In accordance with the provisions of the Rating and Valuation Bill, the; Poor Rate will be abolished and a consolidated &quot; general rate &quot; will be levied in borough and urban districts and &quot;general&quot; and &quot;special&quot; rates in rural districts..X. Registration of Births and Deaths. All duties of Registrars of Births and Deaths, Registrars of Marriages, and Superintendent Registrars within the area of each County Borough, parliamentary borough, and administrative county to be transferred to the Electoral Registration Officer for that area under the Representation of the People Acts.[Notes.-(a) This is in accordance with the proposals of the Registrar-General, and in order to give full effect to his plan for reconstruction of the Registration Service a supplementary Bill wpuW probably be necessary; (6) Superintendent Registrars and Registrars of Births and Deaths are appointed by the Guardians, and the former officer is frequently the Clerk to the Guardians. Registrars
of Births and Deaths are paid in part by statutory fees receivable from the Guardians. The area served by the Superintendent Registrar is the Union area; and the areas served by Registrars of Births and Deaths and Registrars of Marriages are sub-divisions of the Union area. Consequential provision is thus necessary in these respects upon the disappearance of the Guardians. There are, however, no powers or duties vested in the Guardians in respect of the actual registration work itself.]XI. Vaccination .The duties of the Boards of Guardians under the Vaccination Acts to be transferred to the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs.[Note. The duties of Boards of Guardians under the Vaccination Acts include (1) the division of unions and parishes into vaccination districts; (2) the making of contracts with public vaccinators, and (3) the appointment of vaccination officers. It is considered that the discharge of these and other functions performed by the Guardians under the Vaccination Acts could be more efficiently discharged by the County Council than by the Councils of non-county boroughs and other districts.]XII. Audit.All expenditure incurred in connection with the transferred services to be subject to audit by the District Auditors. . ,, .[Note. This pjroposal may meet with objection from the Municipal Corporations whose general expenditure is not at present subject to Government audit. In the case of the County Councils, the Urban and the Rural District Councils, no difficulty arises, as their expenditure is already audited. In the case of the Municipal Corporations, while some of their expenditure on certain special services, e.g., education and housing, is subject to Government audit, their miscellaneous health services are not so subject. It seems essential to provide that expenditure which is now under Government audit should, when transferred from the Guardians to the Municipal Corporations, continue to be audited by the Government auditor, especially as this expenditure is of a kind which particularly requires careful scrutiny and supervision. But the trouble is that the proposal to apply the Government audit to all the transferred expenditure, besides extending this audit into yet another portion of the Municipal Corporations&apos; finances, may also be criticised on the ground that it offends against the doctrine of unified services. On the whole, however, it would seem best to include this proposal in the scheme and if objection is raised, to see how far it can be modified or overcome.]XIII. Grants tn Aid.Pending a reform of the present system of Exchequer grants, the following scheme is proposed for a temporary readjustment and reallocation of the existing grants  (1) Grants in aid of Income: (a) in the case of the fixed grant under the Agricultural Rates Act, 1896, one of two alternatives might be adopted, viz., either (i) the whole of the grant might be paid to the county and county borough councils, or (ii) the sum now payable to the Boards of Guardians might be allocated to the Local Authorities, i.e., the Councils of the Boroughs, Urban and Rural Districts, each of these Local Authorities receiving a proportionate share (calculated on the basis of assessable value or on the basis of agricultural land in 1896 or on the basis of agricultural land now or in accordance with the provisions of an approved county scheme for the allocation of transferred functions) of the amount of the grant hitherto paid to the Board of Guardians of the Union in which the Local Authority&apos;s area was previously included, and(6) no change should be made in respect of the variable grant under the Agricultural Rates Act, 1923, except the changes in the allocation of the grant which would automatically follow the disappearance of the Boards of Guardians from the list of the &quot; spending &quot; authorities and the transfer of their expenditure to the other local authorities.(2) Grants in aid of Expenditure : (a) those numbered 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in the foregoing Memorandum should naturally be paid in future to the local authorities who would incur expenditure under the services in question;(6) the grants, numbered 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 hitherto payable by Councils of Counties and County Boroughs to Poor Law Authorities out of the Exchequer Contribution Account should cease to be so payable, the sums thus released being still, however, available for application by those Councils in relief of Local (County and County Borough) rates;(c) the grant No. 13 should continue to be paid directly to Public Vaccinators;(d) grant No. 14 should disappear, and the County Council be relieved of its payment.XIV. Transfer and Adjustment of Property. The property and liabilities of the Boards of Guardians to be transferred to and vested in the &apos; Local Authorities &quot; in accordance with the rules contained in the following Schedule and subject to the adjustment for which provision is thereby made.Schedule.1. The property and liabilities of a poor law authority shall be transferred to and vest in the local authority whose area includes the whole or greater part of the population of the poor law authority.The Minister of Health [Commissioners] may at the request of a local authority take into consideration any case in which it is represented as being desirable that a particular institution belonging w a poor law authority shall be transferred to a local authority other than that to which it would under
paragraph 1 hereof be transferred and may after hearing all local authorities concerned determine tl the institution shall be transferred to and vest in that other local authority, and thereupon that At shall have effect as if the transfer so directed had taken place under the said paragraph. &apos;3. The local authority shall not later than three months before the appointed day submit for th approval of the Minister of Health [Commissioners] proposals for the use or disposal of any lauds ai 1 buildings transferred under this Act of the local authorities.4. Except in a case in which the area of a local authority is coterminous with the area of a no law authority an equitable adjustment shall be made by the local authority in respect of the propert and liabilities transferred to the local authority by this Act and any sums payable under the adjustment shall be paid in proportion to the rateable [assessable] values of their districts to the borough and district councils acting in the area of the poor law authority in respect of which those sums ar&quot; payable, and the terms of any such adjustment shall forthwith be communicated to the Minister [Commissioners] and to the council of every borough and district within the area of the local authority or within the area of a poor law authority the greater part of which is within the area of the local authority.5. If such an adjustment has not been made within twelve months after the appointed day or if such an adjustment has been so made and within three months of its communication to them the council of any borough or district affected by the adjustment appeals to the Minister [Commissioners] against its terms the Minister [Commissioners] shall after due inquiry himself [themselves] make tho necessary adjustment or confirm or amend the adjustment made by the local authority.6. An adjustment made under these regulations shall not extend to the liabilities of a poor law authority in respect of superannuation allowances payable to or in course of being earned bv officers or servants of a poor law authority.7. An adjustment made under these regulations may in lieu of prescribing the payment of any capital or other sum provide for the differential rating of any area for a period not exceeding seven years.8. Any capital sum paid under an adjustment shall be applied only in such manner as the Minister [Commissioners] may approve.XV. Transfer of Officers.The officers and servants of the Boards of Guardians to be transferred to the Local Authorities, subject to the rules contained in the following schedule.Schedule.1. The officers and servants of a poor law authority shall, subject as hereinafter provided, become the officers of the local authority whose area includes the whole or the greater part of the area of the poor law authority.2. The Minister of Health [Commissioners] may at the request of a local authority take into consideration any case in which it is represented as being desirable that particular officers or the staff of a particular institution shall become the officers or staff of a local authority other than that of which they would under paragraph (1) hereof become the officers or staff and may direct that they shall become the officers or staff of that other local authority and thereupon this Act shall have effect as if the transfer so directed had taken place under paragraph (1) hereof.3. An officer or servant transferred under paragraph (1) hereof shall not without his consent be, by reason of this transfer or of anything done under this Act, in any worse position in respect of the conditions of his service (including tenure of office, remuneration, gratuities, pension, superannuation, sick fund or any benefits or allowances, whether obtaining legally or by customary practices) as compared with the conditions of service obtaining with respect to him immediately before the appointed day, and if any question arises as to the application of this paragraph it shall be referred to the Minister [Commissioners], and. if the Minister is [Commissioners are] of opinion that the requirement of this para-graph has not been satisfied and that the officer or servant has thereby suffered loss or injury he [they] shall award to him such sum or allowance as he [they] may think sufficient to compensate him for that loss or injury and the compensation so awarded shall be payable to him by the local authority to whom he has been transferred.4. The local authority may direct that the office or situation of any existing officer or servant of a poor law authority shall be abolished, or may within three months after the appointed day direct that an existing officer or servant of a poor law authority shall cease to hold office, and any existing officer or servant of a poor law authority may within three months after the appointed day relinquish his office or service. .5. Every officer or servant who relinquishes his office or service as aforesaid, and every officer or servant whose services are dispensed with for any reason other than his misconduct or incapacity, or whose salary, wages or remuneration are reduced on the ground that his duties have been diminished by or in consequence of the passing of this Act, or who otherwise suffers any pecuniary loss in consequence of this Act shall be entitled to be paid by the local authority to which he is transferred compensation for that pecuniary loss and the amount of compensation shall be determined by the Minister [Commissioners] in accordance with the provisions contained in Section one hundred and twenty of the Local Government Act, 1888, relating to compensation to existing officers, and those provisions shall apply as if they were herein re-enacted with the necessary modifications.[Provided that the expression in subsection (1) of the said Section &quot;the Acts and Rules relating to Her Majesty&apos;s Service &quot; shall mean the Acts and Rules relating to His Majesty&apos;s Civil Service whicH were in operation at the date of the passing of the said Act.] .6. A transferred Officer or servant shall be subject to the same liability to pay contribution to tie local authority and entitled to the same rights of superannuation, &amp;c, as against the local authority and the Poor Law Officers Superannuation Acts shall continue to apply to him as if he were a poor officer or servant and the local authority were the poor law authority by which he was employed.
9 9 k   *)7. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 6 shall apply to any person employed as an assistant overseer collector of poor rate or vestry clerk with the substitution for the local authority of the district council becoming overseers for the parish or parishes in which he was so employed, and any expenses incurred by a district council hereunder shall be defrayed as expenses of the overseers for that parish or those parishes, and those provisions shall apply to any clerk to an old age pension committee which is amalgamated with a committee or sub-committee appointed by a local authority for the purposes of this Act or if the old age pension committee were a local authority.[Note. It is for consideration whether, instead of continuing the Poor Law Officers Superannuation Acts, provision could not be made for bringing the transferred officers within a scheme under the Local Government Officers Superannuation Act.]XVI.
