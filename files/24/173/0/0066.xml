JCUMEHT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT).CABINET. RETAIL PRICES COMMITTEE.(Report by the President of the Board of Trade on behalf of the Committee).On May 13th last the Cabinet had before them the First Report o^ the Royal Commission on Food Prices (Cmd.2390) together with a memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade (Paper CP. 236 (25)).     The Cabinet agreed (Cabinet 25 (25) Conclusion 8) that the question should be considered in the first instance by a Committee, who should be asked to report on the following points:-(i) Whether the recommendations of the Royal Commission should be accepted:(ii) Whether the Royal Commission should continue its Inquiry or not:   -(iii) whether, in the event of it being considered desirable to set up the Advisory Council proposed by the Royal Commission, it could be started without legislation as a non-statutory body.The Retail Prices Committee have.held two meetings to discuss these questions and desire to report as follows: (i) Recommendations of the Royal Commission. 1.    The principal recommendation is that a Food Council should be established.     The powers, duties, and personnel of this body, as envisaged in the Royal Commission&apos;s Report, are described in the memorandum of May 11th last (CP.236 (25) )wThe Committee are in favour of the adoption by the Government of the recommendation to establish a Food Council, but we think that the Food Council should toe advisory and voluntary,  not executive and statutory, as suggested by the Royal Commission.     In our opinion it will be undesirable to establish an extra-departmental body, possessing statutory
powers of enquiry into businesses and books, and reportingdirect to the President of the Board of Trade, whose dutyit would be to lay the reports before Parliament.    In anycase Parliament will be fully occupied with legislation forsome time to come and we think that some immediate action by the Government is necessary.    The course we propose andthe reasons in support of it are stated more fully in thedraft statement annexed to this Report.    The Food council should, we suggest, be appointed by the Prime Minister andshould be charged with the duties of watching food supplies and prices, investigating complaints, and publishingreports.    The Council should have a small permanent staff and should Sit monthly, with Buch special meetings as may from time to time be required.;itu- 2. We recommend that generally the recommendationspfof the Royal Commission should be followed, and that the?il.Food Council should include representatives of the Departments concerned, of business interests, and of consumers.    The exact membership of the Council cannot be laid down now, but we think that if he will serve, Lord Bradbury would be a most useful Chairman and that Mr. G.A. Powell, C.B.E., Clerk to the Metropolitan ABylums Board would be a suitable vice-Chairman.    We suggest that the Prime Minister might approach Lord 3radbury, if he sees no objection, the exact constitution of the remainder of the Council being left in the hands of the President of the Board of Trade for -   settlement with other Ministers concerned. -rate8* 3.    The recommendation of the Royal Commission that port authorities should give the most careful consideration to their rates on wheat, with a view, if possible, to making reductions in the near future, does not require any action by the Government and need not be referred to in any public announcement which may be made.

The Royal Commission made a recommendation infavour of the registration of butchers and suggested thatthe Pood Council should lay down the conditions of registration and the grounds of cancellation or suspension.The Commission did not consult Local Authorities on thequestion of administration,  and we think that a finaldecision as  to the desirability of introducing legislation for this purpose should be deferred(1) until the Ministry of Health has consulted withthe Associations of Local Authorities and obtained their views, and(2) until the Food Council has considered. and reported on the proposed regulations.5.  The Royal Commission recommended that the cold.storage proprietors should he required to furnish statistics of the stocks of meat held in cold store and they were infavour of the amounts of  these stocks being made public hutthey left the decision as  to the time and manner of publication to the discretion of the Food Council.We support this recommendation and we suggest thatit might he extended to cover the stocks in cold storeof the principal foodstuffs such as meat, bacon, butter and cheese.6. The recommendation of the Royal Commission in regard to possible Intervention by the British Government in the Argentine meat trade is dependent on the establishment of the Food Council and calls for no expression of opinion by the Government.7. The Royal Commission expressed the opinion that the Government might find it desirable to discuss with the Dominion Governments the possibility of encouraging in the interests of the producer and the consumer the flow of food from the Dominions  to the markets in this country.This proposal has in fact been met by the appointment of the Imperial Economic Committee.-3-
8.     Trie Royal Commission recommended that the Government should exercise their influence to ensure that it shall be the duty of the Economic Section of the League of Nations to make a continuous study of international food problems, and to prepare periodical reports for submission to the Council of the League.There are difficulties in the way of carrying out this recommendation, the principal being that it will, If adopted, involve an increase in the League Ts budget and that it may encourage other nations to press for enquiries by   the League into the supply and, disposal of raw materials. We do not therefore desire to make any recommendation on the subject to the Cabinet and the President of the Board of Trade has requested the British Member of the League&apos;s Economic Committee to discuss the matter with the Secretariat of the League .ftement 9,     We append for the consideration of the Cabinetthe Primelister.       a draft of the statement which might be made on behalf of the Government about the Report of the Royal Commission.(ii)    Continuation of the Royal Commission.If the Cabinet adopt our proposals and agree to anannouncement being made that the Government will establish an Advisory Pood Council we can see no reason for the continuation of the work of the Royal Commission on PoodPrices, and we understand that this is the general view ofthe members of the Commission.We therefore recommend that immediately after the announcement of the Government&apos;s intention the Prime Minister, if he thinks fit,  should address letters to the Chairman and members of the Royal Commission thanking them for their work and saying that in view of the Governments decision there will not be any need for them to continue.
(iii)   Establishment of Food Council as a non-statutory body.We have already answered above (pages 1-2) this part of our terms of reference.(Intld.) P.C. - L.For the Retail Princes Committee.May 27th, 1925.Board of Trade,Great George Street, S.W.I.
APPENDIX.Statement of the Government1a decislong.The principal recommendation of the Royal Commission on Pood. Prices - the one which dominates the whole of the Commission&apos;s Report - is th&amp;there should he a Pood Council, permanently in being, to watch over the supply of essential foodstuffs.     The Commission felt that there was required a continuing association between some permanent body and the food trades, and they describe the ideal which should be kept before this body as being &quot;the reconciliation of the true interests of producer, trader and consumer&quot;. They suggest thst   the Pood Council would bring together the consumer and the trader in an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding, relying for its results rather on friendly co-operation than on regulations and legislative enactment. -With these views the Government are in complete agree-ment.     They recognise the necessity for a body constituted on the lines recommended by the Royal Commission, they appreciate both the value of the Commission^ recommendation and the spirit in which it was made, and they propose to set up a Pood Council of a practical and representative character.The Pood Council which the Government propose to establish will not, in the first instance at any rate, be a statutory body, but will be appointed by the Prime Minister .     It will be specially asked by the Government to continue the study of the problem of food prices where it has been left by the Royal Commission, and to carry iQut, under the President of the Board of Trade, the general plan outlined in the Report of the Royal Commission. It will in fact be a permanent Commission charged with
the duties of watching prices and supplies of the principal foodstuffs, advising the Government on food questions,  examining complaints, and making public from time to time in periodical reports the more important facts about food supplies.      Tho spirit animating  the Royal Commission^ Report is a desire that the public should have before it accurate and continuing information as to food supplies and prices and possess     a means of expression and investigation.    If all concornod co-operate in that spirit it may well be that the Food Council will require no compulsory powers.    Goodwill can do much; and compulsion is a poor substitute for it.       The work done by the Building Materials&apos; Committee under successive Governments shows that a Government body relying on co-operation only, and possessing no statutory powers, may exercise a remarkably steadying effect on prices.    I sincerely hope that the Food Council&apos;s experience will be similar and that it will be able to do its work by voluntary methods, in the spirit contemplated by the Royal Commission.    But If experience shows that compulsory powers are necessary, the Government will not hesitate to ask Parliament to grant them.The Royal Commission make some detailed recommendations in addition to the recommendation for the establishment of a Food Council.    The Commission havo reported in favour of the registration of butchers *      The Government propose to consult representatives of the Local Authorities, and if, after such consultation,  they are satisfied that a system of registration would be practicable and in the interests of consumers, they would, as suggested by the Royal Commission,  invite the Food Council to report as to the conditions of registration and as to the grounds on which registration should be cancelled or temporarily
suspended.The Government accept the recommendation of the Commission that cold storage proprietors should be required to furnish statistics of meat in cold storage and they propose, when a practical opportunity offers,  to introduce legislation empowering the Board of Trade to require regular statutory returns of the stocks in cold store of the principal foodstuffs,  such as meat,  bacon, butter and cheese.I should like to place on record the sincere obligation which the Government feel to the Royal Commission for its arduous and valuable labours in the investigation of a vital and   difficult problem.
