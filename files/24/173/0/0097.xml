SECRET.CP. 295 (25).CABINET.SPECIAL  REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 117.      May 1925.DURING the four weeks ended the 25th May the total unemployment figures remained practically stationary, the net result of the slight fluctuations each week being a decrease of only 546. Analysis of the figures shows that, while reductions occurred in the numbers both of unemployed women, due to better employment in the clothing trades and to other seasonal causes, and also of juvenile workers, as the result of their absorption into industry after the increased registrations at the end of the recent school term, the registers of men unemployed have, with the exception of one week, gradually increased during the period.Further deterioration of the position in the coal-mining industry, together with increased unemployment in the textile trades, particularly woollens and worsteds, was only off-set to a slight extent by improvements in engineering (except marine and heavy engineering), in iron and steel, and in the Welsh tin-plate trade. The other industries showed, on the whole, little change.It will be noted that this Report deals with the position during May, before the sudden advance in the numbers out of work during the early part of the current month had set in.A.

SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Very little change occurred in this industry, and the position generally remained bad. A few contracts for new vessels and increased repair work caused a slight improvement on the Tyne, and the position was better on the Thames and generally on the South Coast, except at Cowes. Employment in the Bristol Channel ports remained poor, except at Swansea, where the improvement previously observed was maintained, and at Barry, where a substantial improvement took place during the month. On the Mersey conditions remained practically unaltered, and there was still much unemployment amongst skilled workers. At Barrow, progress was made with new construction and skilled labour was in demand. In Scotland, employ-ment was bad generally. New contracts obtained were not sufficient to absorb all men employed on vessels now completed, and further unemployment resulted.ENGINEERING.Motor Cycle and Aircraft Engineering. Employment was generally good in all areas and trade was very brisk. Some short-time working took place at Nottingham.General Engineering. A. little improvement was shown in many districts, but employment was still slack on the whole. In electrical engineering the position was fairly good at Tottenham, but not so good at Woolwich, and some slackness was shown in the North-Western Counties in this branch. Textile engineering in the North-Western area showed some improvement, but short-time working still prevailed in the principal districts. A slight falling-off was reported from Yorkshire. Employment in marine engineering was very slack in the North-Eastern Counties. Makers of agricultural machinery and implements were busy at Stamford and Sheffield. In general engineering the position was bad at Bristol, and a slight decline took place at Dudley, Nottingham and West Bromwich, but there was some improvement at Bridgeton (Scotland). Railway engineering work was good at Derby, and full time was worked in the North-Western area, except at Openshaw. Short-time working also continued at certain of the L. and N.E.R. centres. Trade in wagon-building was not so good at Gloucester.TEXTILES.Cotton. Trade during the month was of a fluctuating character, but continued fairly good in coloured and fancy goods. Employment in most districts was maintained at its previous level, and there was no appreciable set-back in any district. Short-time working was still prevalent in the bleaching, printing, dyeing and finishing sections. In the American cotton-spinning section a ballot is being taken on the proposal to increase the working hours to 39^.Woollens and Worsteds. Unemployment and under employment increased during the month. The position at Bradford among wool sorters and wool combers became much worse.   In Wales the position continued bad, and no improvement isCOAL MINING.The depression in this industry still continued, and discharges of workers and increased short-time working are reported from most districts in England, except Kent. In Scotland, apart from an improvement in the Dunfermline area, the position became worse.   Little change occurred in Wales.IRON AND STEEL.Employment remained bad on the whole and much short time was worked. The unemployment figures were reduced at Scunthorpe by the relighting of two blast furnaces, and at Rotherham by the return of workers after extended holidays. In South Wales (except at Pontypool) there was a slight improvement coincident with the advance in the tin-plate industry.   In other areas little change is reported.TIN-PLATE TRADE.There- was a slight improvement in this industry, although a considerable amount of short time was still worked.
reported from Scotland, except at Kilmarnock, where full-time working was resumed.Hosiery. No improvement took place in. this branch, and trade was generally quiet.Lace. Trade was generally bad, and heavy unemployment continued. Improvement in the curtain and plain-net sections was, however, maintained at Beeston and Nottingham.Silk, A slight improvement was shown, but short time was still prevalent at Leek. Trade in the manufacture of artificial silk was good at Derby and Leicester.Jute, Some slackness in trade accounted for an increase of unemployment amongst women at Dundee; otherwise the position remained unchanged.Carpets. There was an increase of unemployment at Kidderminster.BUILDING. BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.Employment continued good in this industry and there was still a brisk demand for skilled workers. Tile-making and the building and red brick trade continued to provide steady employment.CLOTHING.The usual seasonal improvement in the wholesale clothing trade is evident, and there was a large demand for skilled workers. Better employment was afforded in the Leeds area. Employment in the shirt and collar trade was very good, and a slight improvement was shown in the corset and glove industries, although short time was worked at a number of centres in all three branches.BOOT AND SHOE.There was little change in this industry and unemployment was still heavy. Short-time working was prevalent at many centres. Full time was, however, being worked at Stafford, whilst trade was good at Tottenham and Bromgrove, and slight improvements were reported from Norwich, Stepney, Bristol and Wolverhampton. Seasonal slackness was apparent in the slipper trade at Bacup and Rawtenstall.POTTERY.Unemployment was still considerable, but the slight improvement reported last month was maintained. Employment in the sanitary.tile and fire-clay sections was fairly good and continued good in the first-class china trade at Stoke-on-Trent and &quot;Worcester.DOCKS.Employment remained generally slack, and the numbers unemployed increased at Hull, Manchester and Liverpool. Trade showed some improvement at Bristol Docks and employment was better at Weymouth. There was also a slight improve-ment at Middlesbrough, Newport Docks and Swansea.
III. WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24))] The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes gut in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c., accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.BridgeMethod of Compilation.- The figures for the Road and assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those rel schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by. theSchemes assisted by the of certain road the Ministry of Exchanges from toTradetmgFacilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned.It should be noted that in view of recent modifications in the scope of the table the figures given cannot properly be compared with those previously announced in Parliament in similar connections. The figures given for May 1924, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.Works assisted by-Number of Men employed at-1.

IY. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment and should not be so regarded. It should be borne in mind that the excess of the total outward over the total inward movement from this country is somewhat less than 100,000 a year, and therefore small in comparison with the natural increase of population which for many years before and after the war has not been much less than 400,000 a year.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the month of April (with the corresponding figures for April of last year) are set out in the following Table : Monthly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The empire settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924 the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.

Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund.1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Year.

Table 4. Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, of small holdings and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and (b) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-ofi the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements.Sin.ce the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement.(A.) England and Wales.
