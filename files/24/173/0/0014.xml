I . .214IdOC uH^!LJiL.TjaE ?R0PSRy/ 0F HIS BRITANNIC ijAJj^STg^S aOVERTMSlTC?.Cow No. 5vCCABINET. The position of aliens and immigrants under the12(25) -widows and Orphans oto. Bill. Memorandum   by   the   Minister   of   Health.Under Cabinet Conclusion 21(25), I was asked to consider in connection with the Widows and Orphans etc. Bill the two points *? (1) Whether some special provision should be made to prevent aliens from flocking to the country with their dependanta with a view to obtaining the benefits of the Acts (2)   Whether some corresponding provision should be introduced to prevent excessive immigration into Great Britain from Ireland with the same object.The position under the bill in regard to Northern Ireland, the Free State and aliens Is ae follows.Existing widows and, orphans,   tfhere a claim arises in respect of these by virtue of the insurable employment of husband, father or mother previous to the Act, the only special tost applicable will be the continued residence of widow or orphan in Great Britain for two years immediately prior to the commencement of the scheme.Benefits accruing after the Act is in operation.Northern Ireland.     The National Health Insurance Act, 1924, --applies to Northern Ireland and insurance etatos attained and contributions paid whether in that country or in Great Britain will be of equal validity in establishing claim to benefit.   The only restrictive provision applying to Northern Ireland is the condition as to two years continuous residence in Great Britain prior to the date of entitlement above mentioned, with a condition that the last employment (other than temporary employment) of the person
Z1z,   BaapMt of whom the claim arises, was in Great Britain. &quot;irishggjSQ Stste.   The National Health Insurance Act, 1924, does not apply to the Free State, and if a claim to benefit is Ito be established under the bill in respect of a person coming 9from that country to Great Britain/ that person must haHre been I Insured in Great Britain (dr in Northern Ireland) for hot les91I than - &apos;*(a) two years in the da.se of widows and orphans pensions;(b) five years in the case of an old age pensioni The residential and last employment qualificationfalready mentioned applies also to this case.Aliens.. The position as regards aliens is the dame as In 1 regard to persons coming from the Free State.As regards persons over 70 who by virtue of the bill I may receive old age pension under the Old Age Peris ions Acts, 1908 ito 1924, without reference to means, nationality^ etc., a claim lean be established under the bill in respect of such persons if I they have been continuously insured from the date of introduction of the bill and have the two years residential and lost employment qualification already mentioned.The arrangements to be made in the bill as regardsaliens were, I understand, carefully considered, by the Andersonommittee.     They came to the conclusion that if any differential provisions against aliens were to be introduced, most serious Administrative difficulties would follow, since such provisions In fact imply scrutiny of the national status of all persons I in respect of whom claims arise.     Actual experience in National fealth Insurance administration established that differential -revisions against aliens were in themselves most difficult and 0stly to work and all such provisions were swept away by the Rational Health Insurance Act   of 1918.      It is impossible under fhe scheme of administration embodied in the bill to adopt one
policy -for aliens in regard to the benefits under the bill and a different policy in regard to benefits under the National Health Insurance Act.Contributions must be obtained in respect of aliens since otherwise they will be placed in a privileged position.. If contributions are obtained, benefits cannot be refused.   The return of all the contributions or the return of some part of the contributions (with correspondingly decreased benefits) is administratively impracticable.There may conceivably be some force In the contention that the bill as it stands may tend to encourage alien immigration, though 1 should not suppose that any alien who would not otherwise have come to this country will toe attracted by this bill (which does In faot provide a fairly stringent residence and. contribution test) . If, however, my colleagues think proper, I could alter the bill In such a way as to make it possible to prescribe more stringent testa, should experience shew that increased stringency is requisite. There are of course powers vested in the Home Secretary for dealing with alien immigration.As regards Northern Ireland and the Free State, I have come to the conclusion that the bill should stand as it is.   In view of the position of Northern Ireland under the National Health Insurance Act, we cannot restrict facilltites as regards Northern Ireland since approved societies operate equally in both countries. As regards the Free State, the position is already less favourable under the bill than for Northern Ireland, and I would submit that the conditions in the bill a3 to insurance and residence in Great Britain are adequate.     Those conditions will of course apply equally to the other Dominions,(Intd.)    N.C.Ministry of Health. 24th April, 1925.
