With reference to B.1.(25) 1st Minutes, the Committee had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (U.1.(25)  3) covering draft clauses for the proposed Unemployment Insurance Bill together with a Memorandum on the proposals by the Government Actuary.After some discussion the Committee agreed torecommend to the CabinetThat the Unemployment Insurance Bill should contain provisions dealing with the following matters:-fa) -A clause to continue the power of waiver conferred on tho Minister of Labour by Section 1 (3) of the Unemployment    Insurance (No,  2) Act 1924, after 1st October, 1925.(i$)  The prolongation of the waiting period from 3 days to 6 days.(iii)  The reimposition of the conditionsaffecting the following clas.ses which were relaxed in February 1924;-(a) Single persons residing with parents or relatives who can support them.(b) Married women living with their husbands who are in employment.fc) Persons who are working short time and whose incomes are sufficient to justify the withholding of extended benefit.fd) Certain classes of aliens.(iv) Reduction    of the rates of benefit in the case of single men from. 18/- to 15/-, and in the case of single women from 15/- to 12/&apos;-; the reduction to be applicable to covenanted or uncovenanted benefit. No alteration to be made in tha rates of benefit payable to married-persons with or without children.&apos;-;In the course of considerable discussion as tothe financial effect of the above proposals theCommittee were informed that a reduction in the
contributions for men of 7d. in all (4d. employer 3d. workmen) plus corresponding reductions in the contributions of women and juveniles would cost  13,500-000 per annum to which must be added  5,000,000 per annum, the amount by which the Fund are running into  debt.     Aa against this aggregate deficiency of  16,500,000 the savings resulting from the proposed changes would aggregate  8,500,000 per annum, leaving  8,000,000 to be found from elsewhere, Various suggestions for dealing with this deficiency were examined by the Committee including a&apos;proposal that the contribution for men should be reduced by 5d.   (3d, employer and Sd. workmen) plus corresponding reductions in the contributions of. the other classes. This suggestion met with genera,! approval and the Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to confer with his officials on the matter and to lay his proposals for financing the scheme in due course before the C ab inet,8 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.(l)
