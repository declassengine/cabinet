Off)^ o 0[is DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR. *JHOURS OF WORK LEGISLATION.325in speaking in the House on the Hours of Employment Bill on May Isti I made it clear that the Government would be prepared to consult with representatives of foreign Governments as to the possibility ef securing an effective international agreement for regulating hours of work in industry,in my opinion it is very desirable that we should at once take steps in this direction, and I submit the following programme .     The Government shculd send an invitation through theForeign Office to the following Governments enquiringwhether they would be prepared to attend a Conference on .the above subject at a date to be fixed laters-Prance, Italy, Germany, Belgium,Czecho-slovakia. These countries Include the European countries who are of chief concern to us in regard to foreign competition; It is obviously desirable, if progress is to be made, to keep the initial meeting as small as posaibie, but I think it would be necessary to allow other countries to come if they expressed the wish to do so.   It would be an advantage if Holland were represented, in view of the ship-repairing position, but, in order to avoid the claims of other countries, it would probably be advisable not to issue an invitation to Holland in the first place but to inform the Dutch Government that, if they so desired, we should be glad to include them among the oountrles represented at the Conference,   on this, however, I should propose to be guided by the views of the Foreign Office.
It is a matter for consideration whether the United States should be invited to be present or to send an effective observer.     This also is a point for consideration by the Foreign Office.in my opinion it is also necessary that the International Labour Office should be asked to take part in the Conference. If they are left out,  they will regard it - with some justice -as an affront and as a deliberate attempt to go behind them, and their enemies will hail it as such.      They are certainly in a position to create hostility to the Conference,  especially on the part of workers&apos; organisations in all countries, in whose minds the exclusion of the International Labour Office would inevitably cause great suspicion,  and there would be a serious risk of Prance refusing to attend the Conference if M. Thomas,  at least,  were not present.      If it- proved to be possible to achieve real and useful progress,  it would be unfortunate if a failure to invite M. Thomas provided a reason for further controversy.The interval before the Conference can meet should be utilised in informal discussion with British industry and in private conversations with representatives of foreign Governments with a view to the formulation, if possible,  of definite and practicable proposals for discussion.It would be necessary to submit some definite programme to the Conference,  preferably in advance.    I have in mind as the outcome of the Conference a protocol in which the Governments, after re-affirming their general assent to the principles of Part XIII of the treaty and of the Washington Hours convention, would undertake to introduce simultaneous legislation giving effect to the following points
, 370(a) A 48 hours week, with no daily limitj(b) Reasonable overtime at an enhanced rate, with a fixed maximum, such as 30 hours per month, if a maximum can be agreed.(c) In order that full information may be obtained as to the degree of enforcement, there must be provision for the supply to the I.L.O. of   full statements as to the working of the legislation designed to carry out the agreement, including:-(i) The nature of the legislation, (ii) Any regulations made under it. (iii) The particulars of exemptions granted, (iv) Statistical information, preferably in a precise form to be scheduled, showing the extent to v/hich advantage is taken of any exemptions, 6. There should be a definite agreement that theGovernments intend to enforce their legislation, a point which (c) above is meant to make effective.    It may also be desirable to have prepared a list of the points upon which past experience has shown that misunderstanding may arise, in order that definite agreement may be reached as to what is the intention of the participating Go Ternments *(Inltd).    A. S.-M.Ministry of Labour. 4th May,  1925.
