PIS DpgjraggT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT,Ibgret.Ip.205/25.cabinet.(HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE). COASTGUARD    BILL. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I re-submit to the Home Affairs Committee a Memorandum covering the Coastguard Bill, which was put forward by my predecessor on March 18th of last year.   The introduction of the Bill was authorized by the late Government, but it did not In fact take place.    I have now been urged by the First Commissioner of Works to seek Cabinet approval for early introduction and passing of this Bill,Its object is to regularize the transfer from the Admiralty to the Board of Trade of the Goastguard Force, which was effected by administrative action in April, 1923, and to transfer to the Office of Works the lands still.held by the Admiralty in connexion.with the Coastguard Service. The Office of Works experience a good deal of difficulty in dealing with Coastguard properties,   as they are still legally vested In the Admiralty, many being held under leases pro-viding that the properties should only be used for Admiralty purposes, or providing that assignments can only be made with the consent of the landlords.   They are also experiencing difficulties, such as were foreseen in the Memorandum, -particularly in obtaining land, on reasonable terms, for coastguard stations and look-out huts required for an efficient service, - since they lack the statutory powers which the Admiralty possessed, and which the Bill would confer -upon them.
I agree that they ought to have these powers without further delay, and I hope,  therefore,  that the Bill can be referred at the next opportunity to the Home Affairs Committee   with a view to its introduction soon after the Easter Recess.    It should not be controversial.(Intld.)    P.C.-L.Board of Trade,17th April, 1925.
this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. C.P.192.C A B I NET (Home Affairs Ccmmittte) . COASTGUARD BILL. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade -I  submit to the Home Affairs Committee a Memorandum covering the Coastguard Bill,    This Bill is necessary to regularise the transfer to the Board of Trade of the Coastguard Force, which was effected by administrative action a year ago.    It should not be controversial.S .W.Board of Trade, 18th March.  1924.
COASTGUARD BILL.Following upon the Geddes Committee, the Chancellor of the Exchequer appointed an. Inter-Departmental Committee to enquire and report what establishment was necessary for carry-ing out the civil duties of life-saving, revenue protection, coast-watching, etc., discharged by the Coastguard under the Admiralty, what arrangements should be made for a division of responsibility and cost between the Departments, and what economy, consistent with the maintenance of the necessary national service, could be effected.That Committee, in its report Cmd. 1755, recommended inter alia that the Coastguard Force should be transferred to the Board of Trade and should concern Itself, primarily, with duties connected with life-saving, undertaking such other duties for Government Departments as could continue to be undertaken without prejudice to their primary duties.The transfer, which took place on the 1st April, 1923, was effected by administrative action, but the Admiralty have consistently held the view that it would be necessary to repeal or amend the Coastguard Service Act 1856, by which the Coast-guard was put under their control, and the Office of Works consider that serious legal difficulties will arise in connection with the tenure of lands and houses if the transfer of the Admiralty leases is not provided for by statutory enactment.    The Office of Works also require power, similar to that possessed by the Admiralty under the Coastguard Act, 1856, to acquire land compulsorily for Coastguard Stations and look-out huts.   A Coastguard Bill has, therefore, been drafted and agreed with the Departments concerned and is attached.
Clause 1_(1) .    This clause transfers the Coastguardfrom the Admiralty to the Board of Trade and preserves any rights the Coastguard have under other Acts of Parliament.Clause 1  (2).    The Coastguard Service Act 1856 is repealed, except Sections 5 and 6 which deal with the acquisition of land and the powers of the Coastguard existing in 185 6.    It provides that all lands held by the Admiralty, (including buildings) in connection with the Coastguard, shall be transferred to the Office of V/orks, notwithstanding any provisions in leases restricting transfer.    The Parliamentary Draughtsmen and the Treasury Solicitor (who advises both the Admiralty and the Office of IVorks) consider it will be necessary to schedule these leases by an Order in Council.Clause 1 (3) .    The powers of the Admiralty compulsorily to acquire land for Coastguard stations, where necessary, are transferred to the Office of V/orks.Clause 2 o    In time . of war the Coastguard Is to revert to the Admiralty who take the view that there should he express statutory sanction for this so that in common with other necessary business at the outbreak of war, the change can be made without delay.The Bill is now submitted, for Cabinet approval.18/3/2 a.Board of Trade .
