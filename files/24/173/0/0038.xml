HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANN10 MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.e C RETGAB I N E T.REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON FOOD PRICES.MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE&apos; BOARD OF TRADE.1. With reference to the Report of the Cabinet Committeeon the proposed Retail prioee Enquiry (CP.490 (24) ), I desire to take the opinion of the Cabinet on the questions of policy raised by the recommendations made in the First Report of the Royal Commission on Food Prices which has now been published (Cmd.2390).2. The Report is signed by fourteen members, four of whommake minor reservations.    It reviews the causes of the present high level of food prices, then considers the bread, flour, wheat and meat trades, and concludes with recommenda-tions.   There are two Minority Reports, one by Mr. Walter Smith, who was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture in the late Government, and the other by Mr. Ryland, an ex-President of the National Farmers&apos; Union. The former advocates a return to the methods of war-time control, beginning with State Trading and ending with Rat ioning, the latter takes the view that no aotion of any kind is needed beyond the appointment of an inter-departmental committee to prepare and publish statistics and information in regard to food.3- The main Report pursues a middle course between thesetwo extremes.    Its general tenor may be gathered from thefollowing sentences in the Introduction:-&quot;As a result of our investigations, we have been forced to the conclusion that at least some purchasers of bread and meat have to pay an unfairly high prioe for the loaves and joints which they actually receive. In saying this, we do not bring any general accusation of dishonest trading or of profiteering against dealers in wheat, flour, bread or meat.   We have, however, discovered practices which are unfair and contrary to the public interest.    Subsequent paragraphs of this Report show in detail to what special conclusions the        /-1- i
evidence has led  us.     Our most general conclusion is that there should in future be an organ of the State, with statutory powers, permanently In being, to watch over the supply of wheat, flour bread and meat to the people of this country.&quot; (Par.6).As the Report in necessarily of considerable length,I propose to summarise its principal features.Ive the war level.I.GENERAL.rise ofd prices4. The Commission are clear that the main reason why food prices are higher than in 1914 is that the value of money itself has depreciated.     The  . of to-day is worth in the shops about as much as 11s. 2d. in July, .1914.     The value of money has depreciated mainly owing to currency policy and monetary disturbances throughout the world during the last ten years.     The normal price level may be regarded as somewhere between 60 per cent, and 30 per cent, above that of 1913. The recent rise in staple food prices is a reaction frotn the depression in agricultural prices in 1921-1923.        The retail profit on turnover is higher in bread and confectionery than in other food trades. A comparison of the Board of Trade1s wholesale index number of food prioes and the Ministry of Labour&apos;s retail index number suggests a narrowing of the margin between wholesale and retail prices since , 1922.  (Paras. 12-51).II.BREAD.The commission refer to the striking differences between bakers both in the amount of production and
1areaa of distribution.    These differences suggest that there is in the trade a considerable waste of energy and expenditure due to uneconomic organisation of the trade as a whole and over-lapping servioes.  (Par. 60).Methods of sale are. considered and the suggestion is made that there should be differential prices for bread sold over the counter and bread delivered to the customer&apos;s door.&apos;(Par. 62).There are wide variations in the price of the loaf as between different districts, but considerable uniform-ity in a good many districts. This uniformity appears to a be due largely to price-fixing by bakers1 associations, j though the associations are kept in check by the Oo- fjoperative Societies who act independently of then?.. The ff Commission consider that the system of price*-fixing requirj t investigation and watching in the interests of the public.p (ParB. 64-80)..There have been attempts by bakers in certain districts - particularly South Wales. - to eliminate a competitor who sells bread at a lower priced than that fixed by the local bakers&apos; association by   putting pressur^ on millers to cut off flour supplies.    There   has been a    j movement in support of a proposal to include in every&quot;       j contract between miller and baker a clause giving the miller the right to cancel a contract if the-baker soils    JMbread at a price less than that fixod by millers in agree-h ment with local bakers&apos; associations.    These methods are condemned by the Commission. (Pars. 69-72). . JThe evidence as to costs and output given by the ljNational Association of Master Bakers requires modifica- .1 tion, as in certain respects it minimises output and magnifies costs. The practice of the trade of assessing J profits on the replacement cost of flour explains how, on II paper, a baker may be losing money, and yet, in fact, do If a good business.  (Pars. 72-86).  - I
?lyc-r^.x profits. 10. Returns received from retail bakers show thatwhile there is a slight reduction in the rates of net profit on turnover, in comparison with pre-war figures, the bakers concerned have, on the average, doubled their turnover and nearly doubled their Income,     Returns from wholesale bakers indicate a reduction in the rate of net profit on turnover and an increase in net profits of 23 per cent, over pre-war figures.     Prom Bankruptcy Returns and Inland Revenue figures retail bakers appear to be in a better position than they were before the war and than other retail food traders are now.     The largest retail bakers make on the average a net profit of from 7 to 10 per cent, on their sales, and the total net profit of smaller firms is substantially larger.     Retail profits of this size are too high as a general average, and the retail price of bread might be reduced substantially In certain areas.  (Pars. 87 - 105 See too par. 64). lit ion of 11, The Commission report the findings of aCommittee appointed by them to investigate the question whether compulsory discontinuance of night baking would increase the cost of the loaf.    This question had been referred specially to the Commission by the Government.     The conclusion is that, on the assumption that new bread is to be supplied to consumers at the same hours in the morning as at present, the cost of the loaf will be increased by the general abolition of night baking, and that the increased cost would not exceed one halfpenny on the quartern loaf.  (Par, 106).&apos;fat-baking.
develop.&quot;nuXU&apos;oggeated ing com-onses12.        The decadence of the country mill and the develop-ment of the port mill form cue of the outstanding features of modern British milling, and about 50 per cent, of the flour made in this country is milled at the ports. (Pars. 107-109).13. Milling capacity in this country is excessiveand to cope with the rr oblem of excess capacity a suggestion has been put forward by the trade for the buying up of redundant mills.   While there is no immediate prospect of a milling combine in the near future, there is a tendency in this direction and the Commission think that the benefits obtainable from improved organisation of this character should be shared by the millers with the consumers. (Pars. 110-111).14.        Returns obtained from milling concerns coveringtwo-thirds of the total milling capacity of GreatBritain and Ireland show that during the year ended betweenMarch and June 19239 the average net profit per sack of flour of 280 lbs. amounted to 3.9 pence, and during thes.d.subsequent year to Since then the profits havebeen higher, and if the recent prosperity of the industry were to continue the rate of profit might well become unreasonable. (Pars. 125^133). 15. In the milling Industry, as in the baking trade,there are price-fixing associations,  and the Commission express the view that the operations of these bodies require watching. (Par. 134).
wheat 16 * ces.During the cereal years 1921-1924 world prices of wheat were very low and the British consumer benefited at the expense of the producer.     These low prices were due primarily to over-production.      The recent rise In prices was caused &quot;by failure of crops and restriction of production consequent upon low prices.      (Pars. 135-141).ula-     17.m-     18.of theu^ers&apos;19.SSi    20.The effects of speculation are discussed.      The day to day fluctuations in the price of wheat are the primary oause of speculation, but speculation may intensify the violence of these fluctuations.      &quot;Bull&quot; speculation may add momentum to the natural rise of prices in a year of scarcity and &quot;bear&quot; speculation may depress prices below their true economic level.     Reference Is made to the enquiry now being conducted by the United States Government into recent speculative operations on the United States wheat markets.      It appears to be the case that the price of wheat is, more often than not, lower In United Kingdom ports  than the current price in exporting countries, plus the cost of transport and handling, but it is not believed that the proportion of the supply affected by this phenomenon is large.    (Pars, 142-149).The Report describes  the movement of wheat from.centres overseas to British ports and refers to conditions in producing countries.    (Pars,  150-159).Reference is made to the movement in producing . countries for the formation of producers&apos; pools with the object of obtaining higher prices for farmers.(Pars,161-162),The Commission reject a proposal put before them for the establishment of Government granaries by means of a national elevator system.  (Pars, 163-164).
During the years 1922-1924 ocean freight rates . have been little above those of 1912 and 1913 but port charges show considerable increases and the Commission urge that port authorities should give most careful consideration to their rates with a view to making reductions.      (Pars. 165-172).Precise information as to profits on wheat made by traders in this country is- almost unobtainable owing to the difficulty of separating the trade In wheat from that in other kinds of grain and to the fact that wheat is an article of International trade, and It Is therefore impossible to differentiate with certainty between wheat consigned to and received in this country and wheat traded to the Continent.   Returns obtained from the trade show a small but adequate margin of profit in good years and a loss in bad years.    (Pars. 173-177).The Commission have been unable to find any evidence of control being exercised by a limited number of traders over the international wheat trade.    (Par.178)The Commission refer to the elasticity in supplies of wheat and in the demand for it, and. to the inter-relation between high prices and. supplies. They conclude that from the consumers point of view it will probably be found that a year of high wheat prices has been In the long run no disadvantage, and has resulted in increased cultivation and lower prices in the following year.      (Pars. 179-182),
V     MEAT    RETAIL TRADE. 4  1 *)&apos;     25. The Commission have sifted a large amount ofinformation about butchers&apos; profits and conclude that the great majority of Individual butchers make an Income of less than  500 a year.     Butchers have considerably improved their financial position sinoe before the war, and a slight Improvement is shewn in their profits since the Linlithgow Committee reported two years ago,   London butchers appear to have doubled their income since 1913; in England and Wales, outside London, the average per-eentage net profit on sales shews an increase from 5.3 in 1922 to 5.5 In 1924.   Co-operative societies net revenue from meat has doubled since before the war. (Paras.191-210).Meat 26. The Commission refer to wide variations in prices in different shops and different localities.   Theaverage profit realised by the retail butcher representsfrom ^d to fd. per lb.   The Commission find that manybutohers are in fact making larger profits than this and could reduce prices by as much aa Id per lb, onhalf the meat they sell.   Only in exceptional casescould prices be reduced by Id per lb. all round.    Theaverage profit made by the Vestey Combine In theirretail shops is just under ^d per lb.     The &quot;fair retail price list&quot; issued on behalf of the City Corporation(and published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and other papers)would appear often to allow an excessive profit to thebutcher and is of doubtful value. (Paras .208,211-232) .The Commission state:     &quot;the evidence we have obtained points to the conclusion that a reduction of as much as Id per lb. on all beef and mutton sold inbutchers1 shops would at the present time extinguishprofits in all but a few exceptional cases.    We have no complaint to make of those butchers who make less thanper lb. net profit on the sale of meat under its proper description&quot;, (para.319).-8-
The amalgamation of shops in the hands of the Union Cold Storage Company has tended to diminish competition&apos; and the competition of Co-operative Societies is not so effective as it might he in keeping down prices, where .* good dividend is more popular thw.n low prices.    In many parts of the country &quot;buying rings&quot; are commoner th^n tr-ide witnesses suggested.    In general, competition is not so keen as it w*s before the war.    (Paragraphs 233-236).8. The Commission were impressed with the prevalence of the practice of selling imported meat as home-killed meat and   state that misdescriptlon is also common In relation to different grades of imported meat.   More could be done by many local authorities to enforce the provisions of the existing Sale&apos;&quot;of Food Order, 1921, but the Commission do not regard this as a sufficient deterrent and therefore recommend the registration of retail butchers as a means of securing stricter supervision by the local authorities, (see below, paragraphs 41/5) (Paragraphs 237-245).VI MEAT - IMPORT TRADE. 29, Prices of imported meat in provincial markets and depots are regulated from Smithfleld and the uniformity of prices quoted in the provinces leads the Commission to suppose that there are informal discussions between importers as regards provincial sales.   There is no evidence of attempts to fix prices on Smithfield.   Mutton and lamb prices have probably reached the highest point in the course of recovery from the reoent depression, but beef prices (whole -sale) are more likely to rise than to fall during the next two or three yeurs, (Paragraphs 253-282),30.        The Argentine producer is said to be largely in the hands of the refrigerating companies.    Swift&apos;s and
Amour1 a control about 60 per cent, of the meat exports j the Vestey group about 28 per cent., and independent companies about 12 per cent*   There la no evidence of concerted price fixing in the Argentine; but indirectly the refrigerating companies are able to influence prices in Argentina and on Smithfleld by regulation of shipments through a freight committee.   The Commission state that regulation of shipments is necessary to avoid waste, but that the system is open to abuse and should be supervised In the public interest.    (Paras. 283-295). 31.        Statutory control of exports and shipments of meat from New Zealand is vested in the New Zealand Meat Producers&apos; Board, which aims at regulating the flow of supplies to Smlthfieia andstabilizing prices.   The activities of the Board appear to have checked speculation and reduced the profits of importers, but have not, in the Commission&apos;s view, prejudiced the interests of consumers in Great Britain.   At the same timo the Board has full powers to establish a monopoly for the sale of New Zealand meat in world markets, and for this reason the Commission think it is essential that a body representing all interests concerned in this country (such as the proposed Pood Council), should watch the operations of the Board and &quot;Intervene with friendly counsel if at any time the Board should be led by pressure on the part of the producers In New Zealand to take any action which might be construed as detrimental to British Interests&quot;. (Paras. 296-308).
ralian       32. Beef production in Australia has been unremunerativein recant years, but if beef prices should rise, production is likely to develop.     Exports of mutton and la:nb from Australia are oxpected to Increase. (Paras. 309-314). 33 . An examination of the books of the Union cold storage Company, shows that the retail profit on all meat sold in their 2,300 shops during 1924 were just under id. per lb., which Is rather less than the average rate of profit realised by private butchers.     In their South American business they made a profit of 0.2l3d* per lb. on all meat handled by the Company&apos;s freezing works during 1924.    During the first six months the profit amounted to 0*54d. per lb., and in the last six months there was a net loss of 0.025d. per lb.    On chillod beof alone the profit during the first six months reached the large figure of 0.76d* per lb., but against this must be set a loss of 0.4d. per lb.    during the last six months.. In the case of Kew Zealand lamb an average profit of over i&quot;d. per lb. was made by importers between November, 1923, and June, 1924, but since December last, losses. . have been made owing to the high level of producers&apos; prices in New Zealand. (Paras. 208, 315 - 318).
Various witnesses placed before trie Commission proposals for State action with the object of reducing food prices and maintaining food supplies.    Sir Charles Fielding, who was Director General of Food Production in 1918-1919 suggested the establishment of a &quot;National Food Board&quot;, to be composed of trained business men, and to possess statutory powers to control and organise the import, production,and distribution of wheat, meat and milk, to control the milling industry, and to fix the price of flour and other milling products, and of bread.    A somewhat similar scheme was advanced by Sir Leo Chiozza Money who urged the establishment of a Department of State charged with the duty of provisioning this country.    In his opinion (which is not shared by the Commission) the food position of this country is growing precarious in peace and has become desperate in war,   Mr. E.F,Wise, who appeared as a witness on behalf of the Independent Labour Party, proposed the establishment of Import Boards with capital supplied by the Treasury, for the purpose of carrying on the wheat,  and meat trades.   Other features of his proposals, which amounted to complete socialisation of the food trades, were the transformation of the milling industry into a public utility service, owned and controlled by the State, the baking and sale of bread by local authorities, and the taking over   of the Vestey businesses by the State. Mr, Fred Bramiey and Mr. Arthur Greenwood, M.P, appeared on behalf of the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party in support of Mr. Wis3fs proposals,  and added as their particular contribution suggestions that the League of Nations should examine the operations of international food and shipping combines, elaborate
measures for their control, and co-ordinate the State organisations to be set up by different nations for purchasing foodstuffs.      They also supported a proposal for domestic anti-trust legislation, and urged the establishment of a Pood Consumers&apos; Council.VIII. THE COMMISSION&apos; S COMMENTS ON THESE PROPOSALS. 35. The Commission do not support the above proposals.The majority of the Commission are not convinced of the soundness of the policy of State trading, to any develop-ment of which under normal conditions some of them are opposed.    The Report gives a full and interesting state-ment of the economic, political, and diplomatic objections to State trading in food and advises the Government not to embark upon this &quot;hazardous experiment&quot;,  (Pars.  320-332). The Commission feel, however, that there is scope for international oo-operation, and they suggest that the British Government should exeroise their influence to ensure that international food problems should be studied by the Economic Section of the League of Nations. IX.    THE COMMISSIONS RECOMMENDATIONS.Pood   36. The principal recommendation of the Commission, and the(icil.one which dominates the whole of their Report,  is that there should be established a permanent body to which they give the name of &quot;the Pood Council&quot;.  (Pars.334-336). While rejecting State trading and State control the Commission feel that there is required a continuing association between some permanent organ of the State and the Pood trades examined by them.    The Pood Council is not to be &quot;a new Department of State with a considerable staff&quot; but a body which would combine representation of economic, financial, administrative and consuming interests. It would consist of twelve members, the Chairman being permanent and appointed by the President of the Board of Trade.      The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,
goods work -ppera-thethe Minister of Health-and&quot;&quot;l^he^e-cretary for Scotland would each nominate one member,    Four-oth^irvjT*eTrtf^3o^ be appointed by the President of the Board of Trade on the ground of &quot;wide business experience&quot; and, of these four, one, it is suggested, would be a Director of the Wholesale. Co-operative Society.   The remaining four places would be utilised for the representation of the consumer and two of the consumers&apos; representatives would be nominated by the Trades Union Congress, the other two being nominated by or on behalf of the Local Authorities.    The normal term of office for all members except the Chairman would be four years.      The Commission state that they attach particular importance to the representation on the Council of the point of view of the practical housewife, and suggest that two of the four Consumers&apos; representatives should be women.      (Par.337) 37, The Commission assume that Northern Ireland would,if it thought fit, adopt legislation for the establishment of its own Pood Council, but they mention as an alterna-tive that arrangements could be made for the representa-tion of Northern Ireland on the Pood Council (para.  336). 38. The ideal which should be constantly before the PoodCouncil Is described as being &quot;a reconciliation of the true interests of producer, trader and consumer&quot;.    The Pood Council would bring together the consumer and the trader in an atmosphere of mutual respect and under stand-ing.  (Par. 347),    It would act as a mediator between producer, trader, and consumer for reconciling to a common end interests which the Commission do not regard as necessarily conflicting.  (Par. 336).    To all honest traders it would be a friend and adviser, not an inquisitor, and it would lead the way in a concerted national effort to raise the efficiency of the food trades, relying rather on friendly co-operation than on regulation and legislative enactment.
Protection 39. ntisumers .At the same time -the &quot;Gouncil^w-ould- he-chargedwith the duty of protecting the consumer and for this purpose It would investigate specific complaints, draw attention in periodic reports to localities, where prices were unduly high and where cases of profiteering were discovered, use the power of publicity, and, if necessary, give directions.     Many concrete Instances are given in the Commission&apos;s Report of possible intervention by the Pood Council, e.g. in the investigation of price fixing by bakers and millers, and of attempts by bakers&apos; associations to put a non-associatio/! competitor out of business;    and In securing a reduction of bread prices;    and In advising Local Authorities in the issue of lists of retail meat prices. Generally the Commission suggest that in the absence of anti-trust legislation, the Pood Council should be required to investigate the actions of persons, firms, or associations behaving in a manner contrary to the public interests;    should, if satisfied that a case is made out, instruct them to &quot;desist&quot;--   and should, if necessary, .&quot; Issue consequential directions&quot;.     In the event of non-compliance the Council would report to the President of the Board of Trade who would, lay the report before Parliament.     For the moment the Council suggest no further sanction because they believe that &quot;publicity and the force of a mobilised public opinion&quot; will suffice.be to study the situation in regard to food supplies and to keep the public fully informed by periodical reports as to the working of the principal food trades. The Council would therefore require powers to obtain returns from ti^aders and to have the returns verified if necessary.a! 0^t^and 40. v i2^btain ns.A further important duty of the Food Council would
The other and more detailed recommendations are: 1.     That tho Government should exercise their influence to ensure that it ahall be the duty of the Economic Section of the League of Nations to make a continuous study of inter-national food problems, and to prepare period -ical reports for submission to the Council of the League, and to indicate from time to time such aotion as may be practicable.  (Par,333). 2.       That the Government may find it desirable to discuss with the Dominion Governments the possibility of encouraging, in the interest of the producer and consumer, the flow of food from the Dominions to the markets of this country, (Par. 333). 3.       That the Food Council should in particular(a) In connection with baking, investlgatthe apparent overlapping, with waste of energy and expenditure, in the trade (par. 60);(b) In connection with bread distribu-tion, consider whether consumers who have their bread delivered should not pay for that service so that bread sold across the counter may be cheaper (par. 62);(o) in connection with the system of fixing the price of bread by bakers&apos; associations, maintain close and continuing supervision and intervene when prices tend to become unreason-able;   (pars. 68 and 104);(d) in connection with milling watch anytendency towards&apos; a combine and to the operations of price fixing associations and intervene if necessary in the interests of the consumer (pars. Ill and 134);(e) should advise Local Authorities onthe issue of lists of fair retail prices (par. 229);(f) should watch future developments inconnection with the import of meat from Argentina since, in the Commission^ judgment, it may become necessary for the Government to intervene either by acquiring a controlling interest In British companies operating in Argentina, or in some other way, if at any time the supply of chilled and
frozen meat to this c-oun-try should come to be dominated...by adverse trading oper-a^tions-&apos; (par.  395).4. That In connection with port charges on wheat,the port authorities should, give most careful oon-sideration to their ratos with a view if possible to making reductions  (par. 172).5. The Commission endorse the recommendation of theInter-Departmental Committee on Moat Supplies,  1919,in favour of compulsory registration of retailbutchers, the conditions of registration and the grounds for cancellation or suspension of registration to belaid down by the Food Council.    Those suggested bythe Commission are:(l)      Tho due observance of public health regulations in regard to the sale of meat.(2)      The observance of regulations as to the marking of meat laid down in the existing Sale of Food Order, 1921.(3)      Accurate description of meat sold in invoices and weekly account books.(4)      Exhibition in a prominent place of a list of prices charged for all classes and joints of meat on sale in the shop.(d)      The supply of any information as to their business that may be called for by the local authority or the Food Council in the exercise of their statutory functions.(pars. 243-245). G. That cold storage proprietors should be required &apos;to furnish statistics of stocks of meat held in -  cold store,  the decision as to time and manner of publication to be left to the discretion of theFood Council,   (pars. 265-268).The Commission express the view that the time has come to equip some body with power to deal with monopolies, trusts and combines, which charge unduly high prices or suppress competition,  and they think that public apprehensio will not be set at rest until the State has armed itself wit the necessary powers not only for dealing with trusts in the food trades but also in other trades,   (pars.342-343).
X * COMMENTS ON THJB COMMISSIONS RECOMhBNDATIOKSOn the major question of principle I am on the whole in agree-ment with the recommendations of the Royal Commission and I concur in their proposals as to a Pood Council.     There is no doubt that the high level of food prices causes continued anxiety especially to those whose incomes have not appreciably increased since the war.     I doubt if it will be possible for any Government to allow questions of food supplies and prices to continue any longer, as they are at present, in almost complete neglect.     It is easy to deride the limited powers of the proposed body and perhaps to ridicule some of the expressions with which it is recommended.   But if we refuse to establish that body, we might find it difficult to resist later more formidable proposals, which would do serious harm and would constitute a dangerous precedent.     Personally I believe in publicity as a sanction and I am very doubtful about other forms of control.     The mere existence of some organisation of the kind suggested will, in my view, be of great service both to the Government and the country.     This view is confirmed by the salutary effect on prices which appears to have been produced by the investigations&quot; of the Royal Commission.My colleagues &quot;will remember that a promise was given at the last election that a Royal Commission would be appointed to investigate food prices and that after the appointment of the Commission the Prime Minister stated in his speech in the Albert Hall on Deoember 4th last that, &quot;so far as it may lie with the Government, I undertake that we shall do everything in our power to give effect to the recommendations that may be put before us&quot;,&quot;&apos; I feel that in view of this statement and of the Report of the Royal Commission it will be very difficult for the Government to reject the proposal for the establishment of a Food Council.&quot;-&quot;This Declaration was intended to apply to the Agricultural Conference as well as to the Food. Commission.
44. on.If the Cabinet approve the proposal to establish a pood Council it will be necessary for legislation tobe introduced.    The present state of parliamentary business makes it impossible to hold out hopes that the necessary legislation can be carried through in the course of this Session, but I think the Government should announce without delay its intention of introducing legislation at the earliest possible moment. 45.       The Commission confine their specific recommendations to the food trades which have been considered by them, i.e., the wheat, flour, bread.and meat trades, but they clearly envisage the application of their dominant recommendation   to all food trades.    It would obviously be impossible for a Pood Council with the wide powers suggested to be set up   simply for the purpose of super-vising only the food trades already considered by the Commission,  and I would suggest that any Bill to be drafted should purport to include all foodstuffs used to any large extent by the housewife,    I attach a rough schedule of these -foodstuffs.In one or two respects I do not agree with the detailed proposals In regard to the Pood Council.   Por instance,  I feel that it would be more in accordance with constitutional precedent if the responsibility for all the appointments to the Food Council rested primarily with the President of the Board of Trade, who could ba required to consult his colleagues on the representation of Scotland, Agriculture, and Health, and the Trades Union Congress, and possibly the Local Government Associations, in selecting the representatives on .
of consumers.    If Northern Ireland is not to have a separate Food Council of its own, some arrangement   must be made for having It3 interests considered, but I should have thought that the attendance of an official at meetings of the Council would be enough.    A Northern Ireland Local Authority member   might        also possibly be appointed at some &quot;period, or an Irish business man, 47.        as regards the other recommendations of the Royal Commission, I see no objection to the duties suggested being placed on the Economic Section of the League of Nations, provided, of course, that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agrees.    I am considering whether the question of encouraging the flow of food supplies from the Dominions should be taken up with the Dominion Governments as suggested by the Royal Commission, and I am in consultation with the Imperial Economic Committee on this point.   As regards the views expressed by the Commission on the subject of general anti-trust legislation,    I do not think we need take a decision on this vexed question at present.48,       I suggest therefore, that the Prime Minister should announce the acceptance,  in principle, by the Government of the Royal Commissionrs main recommendations and our intention to introduce the necessary legislation In due course,P.C-L.11*5.25*Board of Trade.
