S2Qf25). &quot; &apos; Memorandum by President of the Board of grade.The report of the Lsoe Committee has now been signed and I must ask fer an, early decision with regard to the imposition of a duty on lace and embroidery.In July, 1923, the Conservative Government appointed a Committee consisting of Sir George Barnes, Sir Robert Glanfield, Pame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan and Mr. Pugh &quot;to enquire into the causes of the unemployment at present existing in the machine-made lace and machine-made embroidery industries, and in the silk industry, and. to report what action, if any, can be taken to improve the position&quot;.The terms of enquiry were purposely made of a general character and the enquiry was not directed under the Safeguarding of Industries Aot, beoause, as the competition came largely from Prance,  it was realised if a duty was to be recommended it should be a general duty.In IJovember, 1923, the Committee presented a unanimous Report on Lace and Embroidery and recommended a general duty of 33^ per cent.    A copy of this Report is attached to this Memorandum.The Committee found that retained imports were substantially less than those of the pre-war period faeo para. 54j *     They found, however,  that the home market had considerably contracted owing to ohanges of fashion, and that since the year 19SO the foreign manufacturer had steadily improved his position in the home market and that he was aotually displacing the Britisii manufacturer (para. 33).1 *
fT) q nAfter reviewing exhaustively the whole position, including the character and efficiency of the British industry, the numbers employer! and the serious volume of unemployment, the conditions of foreign manufacture with which the British industry had to compete, the assistance which a duty would afford to the home manufacturer&apos; in increasing the expert trade, and the circumstances which satisfied the Committee that no damage would be done to the entrepot trade, the Committee reported as follows (para. 59):-&quot;We have pointed out that unemployment in the lace industry is flue to the combination of a number of causes.   Any one of these would be serious alone.    The cumulative effect appears to be producing a psychological reaction in the Nottingham lace industry which renders the sense of depression still more acute, and the consequences may be nothing short of disastrous.    We feel that the industry is drifting into a position from which recovery will be impossible.   We suggest, therefore, that the proposed temporary assistance of an import duty-should be given at an early date in order to enable the lace industry to survive the present exceptional and abnormal period in its history&quot;.In conclusion, the Committee recommended (para. 81) that a 33 Vs per cent, duty should   be imposed for at least five years on imports of lace and of embroidery manufactured on net or eliminable fabric.In December, 1983, the Committee issued their Report on Silk.   Sir George Barnes (Chairman) and Mr. pugh (the Trade Union Member of the Committee) reportefl against a cluty on silk; the other two members reported in favour of a duty on silk.On the 9th March cf this year, after consultation with the Treasury, the Board of Trade re-appointed the same
9 9 Q *)   5Committee with the exception of Sir aobert Gflanf ield (who had died in the interval) with the following terns of reference :-&quot;to &quot;be a Committee to enquire into and report upon the application made by the federation of lace and Embroidery Employers&apos; Associations, in acoordanoe with the terms of the Memorandum relating to procedure and Enquiries in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries presented to Parliament on 3rd February, 1925, for the imposition of a duty upon maohine-made laoe and maohine-made embroidery and, having regard to the Heport dated 7th November, 1923, of the Committee previously appointed by the Board, to report also whether any changes have taken plaoe since that date in the industries concerned which make it desirable to modify or vary the findings and recommendations contained therein&quot;.These terms were carefully drawn because it was realised (1) that the retained imports v/ere less than those of the pre-war period, and (2) that it was desirable to ascertain through the same Committee whether the oonditious had altered substantially since they made their previous Bei^ort.The Committee has now made a unanimous Report, a copy of which is attached to this Memorandum.The Committee report that the industry is of substantial importance, employing as it does upwards of 20,000 persons (para. 10).They report, as was clear throughout from the published figures, that the volume of retained imports of ootton lace is not abnormal and is considerably less than the volume pre-war, though the retained imports of silk and mixed laces are larger.    But taken together the aggregate imports are much less than before the war.    The Committee therefore found, as they were bound to find, that the volume is not
abnormal, and that if an affirmative answer to that question is considered a condition precedent to the establishment of a claim for duty, the Applicants have failed to bring their case within the strict terms of the White Paper (paras.11 and 20).The figures of imports over a series    of years are set out in para, 11, and further details, year by year, are given in the Appendices.    I may add that the figures for 1924 and for the first quarter of 1925 are as follows  :-Imports.Re-exportsCotton, Beta, Curtain and Lace.Silk Lace and mixed (Silk and other mater-ials) lace.TotalCotton, IT ets, Curtain and Lace.Silk lace and Mixed (silk and other mater -ials )lace.total,24!41,916,049265,247460,502351,29185,57076,1952,267,340350,817&apos;536,697 1,709,909224,099368,99546,80811,2517,3421,756,717235,350376,337On the assumption adopted by the Committee (par.11) that a deduction of 20&apos;/j should be made from the re-exports in order to ascertain the value of the retained imports, the latter was for the first three months of this year  235,627, as compared with  162,537 in the corresponding period of 1924,The Committee then proceed to re-consider the position in the light of their previous Report, which they confirm in every respect.They find (para. 17) that the industry i3 being carried&apos; on with reasonable efficiency and economy.     They emphasise the difficulty of obtaining capital or making improvements in the present depressed state of the
industry;    but they add that there is no doubt in their mind that, given greater security of the home market, firms will be   able to reduce their overhead oharges and thus oompete more successfully in the export trade, which was and still is, the main support of that industry.The Committee find that the   imposition of a duty would cause no injury to any other industry and would not adversely affect the entrepot trade, (paras. 18 and IS).They find that unemployment , which was very serious at the date of their previous Report, has since become worse (para. 23).They find that foreign goods are being sold here at prices not only below the cost of profitable manufacture in this country, but, in some cases, actually below tho British cost of production, and they find that the more labour there is in the article the greater the disparity in prices (para. 27),They report (para. 29)  that by reason of the severity and extent of foreign competition emplosnnent in the British industry is being and is likeljr to. be seriously af feoted.They find (para. 32) that the exceptional competition comes largely from oountries where the conditions are so different from those in this country as to render the competition unfair.They add ( para * 30) that the situation has not improved since the date of the previous 3eport and that they desire to emphasize the views expressed in paragraph 59 of that Report, which is the paragraph I have quoted above.As a result the Committee recommend a duty of 33^/3 per cent, on imports(i) of laoe of all kinds, whether of cotton, silk orother fibre, whether made by machine or by hand, andwhether forming part of or attached to garments or other articles, or not;    and (with the exception of solid dress5.
oh Ifabrics) on all products of the Ieaver&apos;s laoe, the laoe ourtain, the laoe net, and the circular laoe machine, whether termed laoe or not, and(ii) of embroidery manufactured on net or dissoluble or otherwise eliminable fabric, whether forming part of or attaohed to garments or other articles or not.In these circumstenoeB, the Cabinet have to decide whether or not a duty should be imposed.If a duty is to be imposed it is most desirable that it should be imposed in the coming Finance Bill;    and there is no praotioal difficulty in obtainitig the necessary Ways and Means Resolution.Against the imposition of a duty it may be argued that $he case does not come within the strict terms of the Vtfb.it e Paper.     Against this it must be said that the fact that the volume of retained imports is considerably smaller than pre-war was        well-known when the original Committee was appointed and was clearly indicated in their original Report;    and it was clear that they must find the same faot in their present Ueport.     Moreover, while imports have shrunk, the industry has shrunk considerably also; and, as appears from the figures given on page 4 of this Memorandum, the rate of imports is now rising.In support of a duty the following arguments must be urged(l)    The present Report of the Committee confirms in all respects the findings and the recommendations of their previous Report.(2)   It is very difficult to refuse a duty to the lace industry, which is admittedly in dire straits, and which -has successfully run the gauntlet of two enquiries, while a complete^ protective duty is imposed upon the motor industry and while a measure of protection is being given to the silk industry, whose claim was turned down by two

REPORT.To the Eight HonourableSir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E., M.C., M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,1. By Minute of the Board of Trade dated the 9th March, 1925 we were appointed &quot; to be a Committee to enquire into and report &quot; upon the application made by the Federation of Lace and &quot; Embroidery Employers&apos; Associations, in accordance with the &apos;&apos; terms of the Memorandum relating to Procedure and Enquiries &quot; in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries presented to &quot; Parliament on 3rd February, 1925, for the imposition of a dutj &apos;.&apos; upon machine-made lace and machine-made embroidery and, &quot; having regard to the Report dated 7th November, 1923, of the &quot; Committee previously appointed by the Board, to report also &quot; whether any changes have taken place since that date in the &apos;&quot; industries concerned which make it desirable to modify or &apos;&quot; vary the findings and recommendations contained therein.&quot;2. We have held 10 meetings and taken evidence from 21 witnesses representative of manufacturers, importers, distributor makers-up, and the trade unions concerned.3. The Federation of Lace and Embroidery Employers Associations were supported in their application by the british Plain Net Manufacturers&apos; Association, the British Law Operatives&apos; Federation, and the Lace Workers&apos; branch of tli Workers&apos; Union.4. The application was opposed by the Lace and Embroiderj group of the London Chamber of Commerce, the Lace Execute Committee of the Wholesale Textile Association, and tin Embroidery Buyers&apos; Association.The Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congres gave evidence before&apos; the previous Committee, but intimated thai they did not desire to do so on&apos;this occasion.5. Both sides were represented by Counsel, Mr. C. E. Losebj appearing for the Applicants, and Mr. C. P. Entwistle for tk Opponents.Lace.6. The Applicants based their case on the Report^ November 7th, 1923, and supported it by bringing the statistic! tables up to date They stated that the situation had Jid improved, and that competition had become more severe. 1 was contended that French imports, and especially those froThe estimated cost of this Report is  70 15s.

of ;icaj not it fromMlCalais, had, owing to the depreciated franc, made great inroads upon the home market for lace; and we were invited to measure those inroads, upon the home market by the displacement of British lace by French products in the United States market, which has taken place in recent years. In support of this con-tention they pointed out that while in 1913 the United States imported from the United Kingdom machine-made cotton laces to the value of $5,977,000 and from France $5,324,000, in 1923 the total from the United Kingdom amounted to $842,000 only and from France to $4,822,000. The imports from the United Kingdom showed a slight improvement in 1924,and amounted to $1,442,000, but on the other hand the French total increased to $7,251^000. They urged that an import duty of 45 per cent, was needed to bring the foreign- selling prices up to the level of the bare cost of production in Nottingham.7. The Opponents maintained that Nottingham&apos;s present position was mainly due to the decreased consumption of lace throughout the world, owing to the change of fashion, and that other lace manufacturing centres were suffering as well as Nottingham. They stated that although Calais had an extremely good year in 1924, only about 50 per cent, of their machinery was now employed.They pointed out that as Nottingham manufacturers were dependent upon exports to the extent of 73 per cent, of their production, the fall in exports* from  4,175,859 (the average annual value of the four years 1910 to 1913) to  2,659,155 (the average of 1921. to 1924) was sufficient explanation of the de-pression. This argument was emphasised by the fact that the jprice of Nottingham lace to-day is 80 per cent, to 100 per cent, [above pre-war prices, and the amount of lace represented by post-war exports is therefore proportionately less. No criticism Iwas made of the technique and durability of Nottingham laces, but the Opponents urged that the style of lace in which British ^Manufacturers did their staple trade in pre-war days is now out fashion. As compared with Calais, Nottingham had shown lack of enterprise by producing few novelties, and had thereby iiLed to stimulate demand. On the other hand, Calais, they lubmitted, had continued to produce large ranges of cotton, silk, artificial silk, gold and silver tinsel laces, and had thus been able fo secure the bulk of the trade throughout the world.Embroidery.8. With regard to embroideries, the Applicants stated that fieir position had not improved since 1923, and that competition pom Plauen (Saxony) and St. Gail (Switzerland) is still acute. R^hey did not ask for a duty on white embroideries,, but pressed pra duty on embroideries on net and dissoluble fabrics and on all (pries, such as gaberdine, stockinette, and crepe de chine, which Bave not been bleached or dyed subsequent to the process of being Ilpbmidered.5257S* See Appendix A.A 2
9. The Opponents agreed that Nottingham manufacturers could embroider on plain net as well as their competitors, but maintained that they could not produce the embroideries on dis soluble fabric known as guipure laces, at the same high standard or in the game quantity as their competitors in Plauen. With respect to embroidery on other fabrics, the opponents contended that the capacity of Nottingham was small and could not compete with the large range of designs which are produced abroad on many kinds of fabric. Their argument was that Nottingham has not a substantial embroidery industry to protect. Evidence was given that unemployment in the two great embroidery centres of Plauen and St. Gall was very severe. With regard to the former centre, it was stated that more than half the embroidery machines are idle and that there is a heavy percentage of unem-ployment among the 100,000 workers in the lace and embroidery industry. The evidence concerning St. G-all showed that, while in 1910 there were 21,290 embroidery looms, in 1920 the number had been reduced to 13,260, and in 1924 to 10,300, and the number of workers had fallen from 43,902 in 1910 to 13,246 in 1924. As in the case of lace, the reason given for this widespread depression was the diminution in the world demand owing to change of fashion.10. With regard to the Instructions to Committees in Section II. of the White Paper relating to Procedure and Enquiries in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries (Cmd. 2327) we beg to report as follows :- &apos;(1) Whether the applicant industry is,  by reason of the volume of employment engaged in the production oj the goods to which, the application relates, or by reason of the nature of the goods produced, an industry of substantial importance. According to the Ministry of Labour, in the lace industry (which for this purpose includes embroidery) the estimated number of insured workers in July, 1924, was 8,440 males and 11,890 females-a total of 20,330.   This we regard as sufficient evidence of the substantial importance of the industry.  Separate statistics are not available for each section of the industry, but, judging by the small number of machines used for embroidery, we do not consider the embroidery section by itself as of sub-stantial importance, particularly since, in our opinion, it is not capable of meeting all the demands of the home market.  We have, therefore, only considered the embroidery section in so far as it is concerned with the manufacture of embroidered laces or articles of a lace-like nature, that is to say, embroideries on net or dissoluble fabrics.(2) Whether foreign goods of the class or description to which the application relates are being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.
11. Appendix B shows the imports and re-exports of lace from 1910 to 1924. We were informed by the Applicants that in order to ascertain the value of retained imports it is. necessary to deduct from the re-exports about 20 per cent., in respect of the cost of handling, sorting, re-packing, cost of selling and distribution, agents&apos; commission and profit. On this basis the average annual retained imports for 1910 to 1913 and 1921 to 1924 were as follows :  	Cotton Nets, Curtains and -Lace.	Silk Lace *nd Mixed (Silk and other materials).	Total.Average annual retained imports, 1910 to 1913. Average annual retained imports, 1921 to 1924.	  1,463,489 460,590	  184,212 287,301	  1,647,701 747,891I   Iii comparing these figures it must be remembered that the I cost of lace to-day is higher than before the war. I   Prom the above table it is clear that imports of cotton lace are 1 not being retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in I abnormal quantities, though the retained imports of silk and I mixed laces are larger than before the war.   The Applicants 8 stated that  lace is frequently  imported as  embroidery  and lire-exported as lace, but we did not receive any proof of this statement-.   It was further stated that lace is imported in large quantities by parcel post and would therefore not be included in [the official import figures.   The evidence of various witnesses showed that a negligible quantity of lace is imported by parcel si- from Calais Nottingham&apos;s chief competitor but that it is a common practice to import lace from Germany by this method. JNTo statistics are available as to the total quantity imported from [Germany by parcel post, but through the courtesy of H.M. ICustoms we have been supplied with the following details of the Imports of lace by parcel post from Germany for the three months March to May, 1923, and for two months, October and November lot 1924.March to May, 1923.No. of Parcels,Value.October to November, 1924.No. of Parcels.Value.Botton Laces ... &amp;ce and Articles of I lace.I     Total......1,125 8521,97738,363 24,58862,956683 8451,528  7,022 7,19914,221
It will be observed that in 1923 the value per parcel was nearly  32, while in the Autumn of 1924 it had fallen to about  9 From the figures relating to these isolated months, we feel that no firm conclusions can be drawn as to the total amount annually imported by this method. Further, as the parcel post system was in existence before the war, we have no evidence that these figures will materially alter the proportion of retained imports stated above.12. The Census of Production, 1907, showed that the British lace industry exported at that time about 73 per cent, of the total output of the United Kingdom leaving 27 per cent, for the home market. We were informed that the proportion to-day was about the same, but without definite figures of production it is impossible to make any calculation bearing on this point, parti-cularly as lace is largely dependent on fashion, and since 1907 there has been a considerable reduction hi the- world consump-tion of lace. In proof of the reduction which has taken place we were informed by one wholesale distributing house which deals mainly with staple lines, that in 1907 they had five late departments employing 49 men; but to-day only two departments employing eight men. Taking the turnover of lace of this firm in 1907 as 100, it had fallen in 1913 to 56 and in 1924 to 25, thus showing a reduction of 75 per cent, since 1907. Another large wholesale distributing house, dealing with staple lines, stated that their turnover in lace had decreased by 70 per cent, since 1913. To illustrate the difficulty in ascertaining the proportion of the home market which Nottingham manufacturers have retained, we would mention that the firms in question estimated that their proportion of purchases of foreign and Nottingham laces were as follows : 	1907.		1913.		1924.		Notting-ham.	Foreign.	Notting-ham.	Foreign.	Notting-bam.	Foreign.Firm &quot; A &quot; ... Firm&quot;B&quot; ...	Yo 43 20	% 57 80	% 49 33	% 51 66	% 71 62	9i 29 38On the other hand, one large maker-up of clothing for ladies and children stated that before the war he purchased 75 per cent, from Nottingham and 25 per cent, abroad, but to-day this pro-portion had been reversed. Another maker-up stated that, in 1924, 66 per cent, of his purchases of lace came from Nottingham, but he said that the proportion varied from year to year accord-ing to the patterns, foreign or British, which appealed to his customers. We also received evidence that two other important makers-up were unable, on account of price, to purchase Notting-ham lace which hitherto they had bought in large quantities. A firm dealing mainly in dress laces- stated that their purchases
were as follows : In 1907 and 1913 30 per cent. English, 70 per cent, foreign, but in 1924 15 per cent. English and 85 per cent, foreign.13. We were informed that several Nottingham finishers merchant foreign laces as well as those of local manufacture, so it is quite probable that a proportion of the laces stated above as being obtained from Nottingham&apos; were of foreign production.14. The official figures of imports and re-exports are based on values, and it is not possible to ascertain what change of valua-tion has taken place before re-export, nor is parcel post taken into consideration, or laces and embroideries always exactly classified. Accordingly these statistics cannot be regarded as conclusive evidence of the amount retained for consumption in the home market. Moreover, in the absence of figures showing the British output, we are unable to ascertain whether the. propor-tion of the home market secured by British manufacturers) is now less than in 1913. After a survey, however, of the available figures and of the evidence submitted to us, we have arrived at the conclusion that imported laces are not being retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in. quantities which can be described as abnormal.15. The imports and re-exports of embroidery are given in Appendix C. As stated in paragraph 10, we propose only to deal with embroidery on net and dissoluble fabrics. The bulk of imports on these fabrics come from Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium, and we were informed that from Germany they come largely by parcel post, so would not be included in the figures shown in the Appendix. The following figures show the imports of embroidery of all kinds by parcel post from Germany during the three months March to&apos; May, 1923, and October and November, 1924 :- March to May, 1923 ... 652 parcels valued at  17,376. October to November, 1924   538 parcels valued at  4,232.We give these figures for1 purposes of record but do not propose to draw any inference from them. Further, the table in Appendix C shows that the re-exports of embroidery on net and dissoluble fabrics from 1920 to 1924 were much higher than the imports, and even allowing for a fair percentage of profit, the figures are clearly unreliable As embroidery on net and dissoluble fabrics was not separately classified before 1920, it is Jmpossible to state whether the quantity retained in the home Inarket is abnormal, but it is at any rate not large.(3) Whether the foreign goods so imported are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can be] profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.
(4) Whether, by reason of the severity and extent of such competition, employment in the manufacture or property -duction of such goods in the United Kingdom is being or is likely to be, seriously affected.(5) Whether such exceptional competition comes largely from countries where the conditions cure so different from those in this country as to render the competition unfair.16. These three questions appear on their strict construction to be dependent on an affirmative answer to question (2), and in the circumstances do not here arise. We have accordingly dealt under the second part of our Terms of Reference, with the matters involved.(6) Whether the applicant industry is being carried on in the United Kingdom with reasonable efficiency and economy.17. We are of opinion that the Nottingham lace industry is being carried on with reasonable efficiency and economy so far as the staple lines are concerned. This as already indicated was not disputed by the opponents to the present application. The market has considerably contracted, and while Nottingham can hold her own in staple laces which demand little labour, in the other types demanding a greater proportion of labour as compared with the cost of material, it appears to us that Nottingham has lost ground in the home market. It is clear to us, however, that the demand to-day for these types has greatly lessened, and that competition is more severe in the restricted market. There is apparently a demand to-day for laces of novel design and of new materials, even in the cheaper forms of lace, and in this branch of the trade we are of opinion that Nottingham is not obtaining her share. To be successful in the lace trade large ranges of samples in all classes of materials must be produced, and this can only be done at great cost. Wages abroad being lower than in this country, our manufacturers are severely haVlicapped by the fact that their costs of production are much higher than those of their foreign competitors, so that, even if they produced a large range of novelties, they might be unable to sell them on account of price. The result of this has been that with one or two excep-tions British manufacturers have not kept pace with the ever-changing fashions. Moreover, the position of the industry is such that few firms have the capital to embark upon the necessary expenditure, and in a depressed industry such as lace it is practi-cally impossible to attract fresh capital at present. There is no doubt in our minds, however, that, given greater security of the home market, Nottingham firms will be able to reduce their overhead charges, and should thus compete more successfully in the export trade, which was, and still is, the main support of the industry. The same remarks with regard to the difficulties to be faced apply7 to the embroidery section of the industry.
(7) Whether the imposition of a duty on goods of the class or description in question would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment in any other industry, being an industry using goods of that class or descrip-tion in production.18. The only important industry, on which it has been sug-o-ested to us that the imposition of a duty on imported laces and embroideries on net and dissoluble fabrics, would have an adverse effect, is the making-up trade. We do not consider that this would be serious, as the duty would usually apply only to a small part of the finished article. Further, from the evidence we have received, we are of opinion that the home trade is more important to the makers-up than the export trade, and if a duty is imposed on lace and embroidery attached to garments and other articles, makers-up would not suffer materially.19. It was represented to us that the entrepot trade may suffer by the imposition of a duty. We do not agree that it will be materially affected, for before the War a large part of our re-export trade was by means of Through Bills of Lading, and it would appear that the tendency is again in this direction, our re-exports of cotton laces in 1923 on Through Bills of Lading being  1,065,229 out of total re-exports during that year of  1,254,564.* The balance is probably high-class lace.(8) Whether, having regard to the above conditions the applicant industry has, in the opinion of the Com-mittee, established a claim to a duty; and if so, what rate or rates of duty, in the opinion of the Committee, would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition.20. As stated above (paragraphs 11 to 15) the Applicants have act been able to answer question (2) in the affirmative, and if an affirmative answer to this question is to be considered a condition precedent to the establishment of a claim to a duty, we consider that the Applicants have failed to bring their ca^e within the strict ternre of the White Paper.21. We ha^ie now to consider the second part of our Terms of Reference in J which we are requested to rep-w whether any manges have taken place since the date of the report of November 7th, 1923, which make it desirable to modify or vary the findings and recommendations contained therein, which were as follows: (1) There has been a serious contraction in the demand for lace and embroidery throughout the world mainly &quot; owing to (a) change of fashion in dress, and(b) the general decrease in purchasing power.* Annual Statement of the Trade of the United Kingdom, 1923.

&quot; (2) The British lace and embroidery industries are also &apos;&apos; suffering from the following causes &quot; (ft) The lace industry : Increase of foreign &quot; tariffs, and prohibition or control of certain &quot; imports by some foreign countries; and &quot; foreign competition, especially French &quot; German and Chinese, in the restricted ,j &quot; foreign and home markets ; assisted in the&quot; first two cases by the depreciated cur-&quot; currencies of the countries in question, and &quot;in the third case by the low wage standards &quot; prevailing. &quot; The embroidery industry : Foreign competition &quot; l-esulting from the restoration in a &quot;restricted market of the export trade from &quot; certain large centres aided by depreciated &quot; exchanges, particularly in Germany and &quot; Austria, and the consequent lowering oE &quot; prices in Switzerland.&quot; (3) We recommend that a duty of 33-J- per cent, ad valorem &quot; should be imposed for at least five years on imports &quot; into this country of &quot; (a) lace of all kinds, of cotton, silk or other fibre. &quot; whether made by machine or by hand, &quot; and whether forming part of or attached &quot; to garments or other articles, or not, and &quot; also on all products of the Leaver&apos;s lace, &quot; the lace curtain, the lace net, and the &quot; circular   lace machine,   whether termed &apos;&apos; lace or not; and &quot; (b) embroidery manufactured on net or dissoluble &quot;or otherwise eliminable fabric, whether &apos;&apos; forming part of or attached to garments or &quot; other articles, or not. &quot; Assessments of the value of hand-made lace for the &quot; purposes of the duty should be subject tova maximum &quot; limit.&quot;(4) In addition, steps should be taken by the industry to &quot; establish greater co-operation between makers and &quot; finishers.&quot;22. We do not find that the conditions have substantially altered.23. The estimated number of insured workers in the lace industry has fallen from 27,640 on the 31st October, 1921, to 21,570 on the 1st October, 1923. There has been a further fall to 20,330 in July, 1924 (the latest date to which the Ministry of Labour have revised their classification), or a reduction of 1,240 since the date of the previous Report. From the employment point of view, therefore, the situation has certainly not improved.
24. During the present enquiry we were furnished with the rates of wages current in Calais and Nottingham before the war, in August, 1923, and in March, 1925. These figures are con-tained in Appendix E and were certified as correct by the trade unions concerned in Nottingham and Calais, but our attention was drawn to the fact that those in Calais are sometimes exceeded for pivotal workers. In 1914 there was no great disparity between the wages paid in Nottingham and Calais, but wages in Calais are now much lower than those ruling in Nottingham.25. We were also informed that the wages paid in Switzerland and Germany are much lower than those obtaining in this country.26. The result is not only that &quot; foreign goods are being sold &quot; or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are &apos;&apos; below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manu-&quot; factured or produced in the United Kingdom,&quot; but that they are being offered for sale in some cases at prices below the British cost of production.27. Nottingham mainly depends on staple lines and it is prin-cipally on these types, and not on novelty laces, that comparison can be made, as in the novelty end of the trade, design and the nature of the material used play a very important part. The Table, showing comparisons of British and foreign prices on page 12 of the previous Report, still remains good, with minor variations.Evidence was given that the greater the percentage of labour-as compared with the cost of material, the greater is the dis-parity in prices. For example, in the case of a sample where the foreign price is 85 per cent, of the British, the cost of labour is 33J per cent., and in another sample where the foreign price is 60 per cent, of the British, the cost of labour is 43&apos;3 per cent, of the total cost of production excluding profit.28. With regard to embroideries also the conditions have not improved. Comparisons of British and foreign prices are given on page 19 of the previous Report, and these still obtain. Samples were submitted to us showing that foreign selling prices of seven types amounted to 95, 116, 83, 88, 97, 97 and 70 per cent, respec-; tively of the British cost of production, exclusive of profit. In one of these samples the embroidery was on net, and the foreign price was 97 per cent, of the British cost of production exclusive of profit.^ 29. We are satisfied that &apos;&apos; by reason of the severity and extent f   of such competition, employment in the manufacture or pro-&quot;t duction of such goods in the United Kingdom is being,&quot; and &apos; is likely to be, seriously affected.&quot;30. The number of insured workers unemployed in the lace and embroidery industry is given in the table in Appendix D, I which was supplied to us by the Ministry of Labour.   This table
shows that-&apos;on the 23rd February, 1925, 23&apos;4 per cent, of the males and 12:4 per cent, of the females were unemployed and an additional 2-5 per cent, of the former and 36 per cent, of the latter were on systematic short time. We were further informed that these figures do not adequately reflect the extent of under-employ-ment. The situation has not improved since the date of the previous Report and we desire to emphasise the views expressed in paragraph 59 of that Report &apos;&apos; that unemployment in the lace &quot; industry is due to the combination of a number of causes. Any one of these would be serious alone. The. cumulative effect appears to be producing a psychological reaction in the Nottingham lace industry which renders the sense of depression &quot; still more acute, and the consequences may be nothing short &quot; of disastrous. We feel that the industry is drifting into a &quot; position from which recovery will be impossible.&quot;31. Competition in the Leaver&apos;s lace section of the industry comes mainly from Calais and its severity is attributed by the applicants to the lower rates of wages, as compared with JSTottinu-ham, since the depreciation of the franc. Wages do not appear to have kept pace with the course of the exchange in France. No precise evidence was offered to us as to the wages rates in Germany or Switzerland, from whom competition is experienced in embroidery, but we were assured that they are much lower than those obtaining in this country. We desire to call attention to the fact that lace-like embroideries are for practical purposes interchangeable with lace and that their competition must there-fore be considered as well as that of the product of the Leaver&apos;s and other lace machines.&apos;32. The evidence submitted to us shows that &quot; exceptional &quot; competition comes largely from countries where the conditions &quot; are so different from those in this country as to render the. &quot; competition unfair.&quot;33. No evidence of &quot; subsidies, bounties or other artificial &quot; advantages &quot; was submitted to us except with regard to Switzerland, where the Government, we were informed, granted a subsidy to the industry within the past few years with the object of&apos;keeping up prices by limiting the amount of machinery in operation. We understand that this subsidy has now come to an end.34. We are satisfied that both as regards lace and embroidery, British manufacturers are experiencing competition from similar goods manufactured under &quot;conditions of employment of labour &apos;&apos; inferior to ihose obtaining in this country. We have instanced wages in Calais and have referred to Gennany and Switzerland in paragraphs 24 and 25. A certain quantity of Chinese hand-made lace is imported at prices which compete successfully with machine-made laces, and we are assured that Chinese lace is manufactured under appalling conditions of sweating.
35. We adhere to the essential recommendations of the Report of 1923 that a duty of 33J- per cent, ad valorem should be imposed on lace. In order that this recommendation may be more easily carried out we propose a modification in detail.(a) We therefore recommend that a duty of 33-g- per cent. ad valorem should be imposed on imports into this country(i) of lace of all kinds, whether of cotton, silk or other fibre, whether made by machine or by hand, and whether forming part of or attached to garments or other articles, or not; and (with the exception stated in (b) ) on all products of the Leaver&apos;s lace, the lace curtain, the lace net, and the circular lace machine, whether termed lace or not; and(ii) of embroidery manufactured on net or dissoluble or otherwise eliminablei fabric, whether forming part of or attached to garments or other articles or not.Assessments of the value of hand-made lace for the purposes of the duty should be subject to a maximum limit, as proposed in paragraph 56 of the previous Report.(i) We do not recommend a duty on solid dress fabrics made on lace machines. We do not consider these fabrics as interchangeable with lace.In conclusion it is a pleasure to record our indebtedness to our Secretary, Captain S. E. J. Brady. His technical knowledge has been of great assistance to us, and it is owing to his energy and industry that we have been able to complete our report very shortly after the close of the evidence.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed)      Gr.

To The Right Hon. Sib Philip Lloyd-Gbeame, K.B.E., M.C., M.P., President of tTie Board of Trade.Sib..1. Under our terms of reference we were appointed as a Committee, on July 6th, 1923, &quot; to inquire into the causes of the unemployment at present existing in the machine-made lace and machine-made embroidery industries, and in the silk industry, and to report what action, if any, can be taken to improve the position.&quot;2. We have held 16 meetings, and have taken evidence from manufacturers, merchants, exporters, wholesale buyers, large retailers, and representatives of operatives employed in the industries concerned, and in addition a certain amount of evidence bearing on the statistical and general economic sides of our inquiry. The total number of witnesses who have appeared before us is 50. Most of these were examined at sittings which were held in public and which had been previously advertised; some, however, were examined in camera.3. The following is a list of the Associations and organised bodies who submitted memoranda or gave evidence : (a) The Federation of Lace and Embroidery Employers&apos; Associations,which for the purpose of the inquiry was joined by (i) The British Plain Net Manufacturers&apos; Association, (ii) The British Lace Oj)eratives&apos; Federation, and (hi) The Lace Workers&apos;Branch of the Workers&apos; Union.(b) The Embroidery Buyers&apos; Association.(c) The Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress.(d) The Europe Section of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce.(e) The Silk Association of Great Britain and Ireland Incorporated,which acted in concert with(i) The Joint Industrial Council for the Silk Industry,(ii) The Macclesfteld Silk Trade Employers&apos; Association,(iii) The British Silk Spinners&apos; Association,(iv) The Brighouse Silk Spinners&apos; Association, (v) The Society of Silk Spinners and Merchants,(vi) The Coventry and District Textile Manufacturers&apos; Association., -(vii) The Glove and Warp Fabric Makers&apos; Association, (viii) The Leek Manufacturers&apos; and Dyers&apos; Association, and -(ix) The National Federation of Hosiery Manufacturers&apos; Associations,,.Leicester. (/) The Silk Section of the London Chamber of Commerce.The Committee were informed by the Wholesale Textile Association that they supported the evidence on the lace and embroidery industries and on the silk industry given respectively by the,representatives of the Embroidery Bayers&apos; Association and the nominees of the Silk Section of the London Chamber of Commerce. We approached the Scottish Lace Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, but were informed by these bodies that they did not desire to tender evidence. Documentary evidence and examples of lace, embroidery and silk have also been placed before us. We have received very valuable memoranda and statistical data from the Commercial Relations and Treaties Department and the Statistical Department of the Board of Trade, and also the Intelligence and Statistics Department of the Ministry of Labour. Further, in view of the very specialized character of the lace industry, we thought, it desirable to undertake an examination -of the processes involved and the local conditions. For this purpose we have visited a number-of factories and warehouses in Nottingham and district.4. Although there is a certain amount of overlapping of the three industries to which our fcerms of reference&apos; relate, we have endeavoured as far as possible to keep separate our inquiries into them. This Interim Report relates to the machine-made lace industry and the machine-made embroidery industry. Lace is manufactured directly from yarn whereas embroidery is produced on a pre-existent fabric which may or may not be afterwards removed. ]En our Final Report we shall deal with the silk industry.THE  MACHINE-MADE   LACE INDUSTRY.(a.) Natube of the Indtjstby.5. The machine-made lace industry originated in Nottingham more than a century ago, and, in the main, as far as Great Britain is concerned, it is still concentrated in that city and the surrounding district (including Derby), although an important lace curtain industry has been developed in Ayrshire during the last twenty-five years, and&apos; a certain amount of machine-made lace is produced in the West of England, b.   There are, broadly, three types of lace, namely : (a) Laces and Fancy Nets used for decorative purposes on dress, millinery and lingerie.  These are made on the Leaver&apos;s machine,, the. Go-through machine, the Warp machine and the Circular machine.   We understand that the lace output41971 &quot; &apos;     ;   a 2 &apos;
of the Warp machine is comparatively small, and, although there is a certain number of Circular machines in this country, by far the greater proportion of the British output is the product of the Leaver&apos;s machine and the very similar Go-through machine, which had their origin in an invention of John Leaver of Nottingham, in 1814. The Leaver&apos;s machine produces simultaneously&apos; many widths of the same pattern of lace; the much smaller Circular machine generally makes only one width at a time.(b) Plain and Spotted Nets.-These include bobbinets, used in the manufacture ofPlauen Embroideries; mosquito nets; guipure nets employed in the production of embroidered curtains in Switzerland and Germany; and silk nets for millinery, veilings, and dresses.(c) Laoe Curtains. With lace curtains large productions such as lace bedspreads areincluded; the lace curtain machine is also employed in the production of a square-meshed lace known as &quot; filet &quot; lace, for ornamenting dress and for use in upholstery.7. We were informed that the three sections of the industry are kept quite distinct and that it is unusual for a skilled operative to pass from one section to another. The&apos; witnesses put forward by the Federation of Lace and Embroidery Employers&apos; Associations said that, although the Lace Curtain Section of the Industry in Nottingham was feeling the competition somewhat more keenly at present that hitherto, it was not suffering in the same way as the other sections, and they made clear that, except in so far as the Lace Curtain manufacturer is a. producer of &quot; filet &quot; lace, the situation in the Lace Curtain industry did not call for special consideration. As the members of the Scottish Lace Manufacturers&apos; Association axe chiefly engaged in the production of curtains, the decision of that body not to give evidence may be regarded as corroborating this view. We have, therefore, restricted our detailed investigations to the sections : (a) Lace and Fancy Net, and (b) Plain and Spotted Net. The comparatively good position of the Lace Curtain Section is, however, a factor to be taken into account in estimating the position of the two other sections of the industry from the official unemployment statistics, which relate to the industry as a whole.8. The British lace industry contains firms of very different sizes and presents several types of organization. With the exception of a few large firms who undertake all processes and distribute their productions through the world, the practice is for separate firms to carry out the processes of making and of finishing lace. The machine holder, possessing any number of machines from three upwards, usually makes lace in the brown and sells it to a finisher who carries out such processes as separating the widths of lace which emerge from the machine connected together by a draw-thread (drawing), removing superfluous threads (clipping), scolloping edges, winding on to cards and boxing for distribution and sale. A certain amount of this work is carried on by outworkers, but we understand that the tendency is to transfer it to the premises of the finisher. The processes of bleaching, dyeing and dressing are generally carried out by a separate firm to whom the goods are sent by the finisher for treatment. The merchanting of the goods is usually carried out by the finisher; as far as the home market is concerned, he may supply only to the wholesale buyer or may sell direct to the retailer. Again, he may do business direct with foreign or colonial markets or may sell his goods for export to* or through a firm of lace exporters. Such firms send travellers and maintain agents all over the world.9. A characteristic feature of the lace industry in Nottingham and the surrounding district is the tenement factory. In such a factory, which may comprise a number of floors or be arranged as a single-storied building with roof-lights, the space is let out in &quot; standings to the - machine-holders who pay an inclusive rent for the space occupied and the power and heat which are supplied by the factory owner. In many cases the machinery is bought under a hire-purchase system which usually entails the payment of a deposit and the repayment by instalments of the original cost with interest.10. Design, even in the staple lines, was admitted by the manufacturers to be w-portant, but they emphasized equally the value of the technique of draughting whereby the artisfs design is translated into the directions from which the operative works. We weie informed that the production of curtains necessitates-a good deal of designing, but that tew designers are required to supply material for the many machines making Leaver&apos;s or fancy laces.   Draughting, however, requires much more time and attention.11.   It is not surprising to find that with the organization described above tibere^aconsiderable number of small firms both of makers and of finishers of lacemaker, who has often begun life as an operative, sometimes employs his own designersanddraughtsmen, or he may obtain patterns from or have patterns designed and draughted loi him by individuals or firms who specialize in this work. Again, the finisher may supply t ie design which he desires the maker to produce.12.   The highly specialized system of production and distribution just described was strongly upheld by certain witnesses and adversely criticised by others.    We shall dra attention later in this Report to such of these criticisms as bear on the subject of our inquu)-
(b) Size op the Industry ; Relation between the Home and Foreign Markets ;regent history.13. There are no recent figures giving the total extent of the lace industry in the United Kingdom; the only full statistics, in fact, are those set out in the Report on the First Census of Production of the United Kingdom in 1907, which was a,good year for the lace trade. The figures show the value of the total make of cotton, silk and; all other kinds of lace in 1907 as  6,974,000, of which amount  117,000 represents the value of hand-made lace. The value of machine-made lace produced was, therefore,  6,857,000. In that year the total export of lace, as given in the Trade and Navigation Returns, was valued at  5,010,000. This amount presumably includes some hand-made lace, but no great error would be made by taking the value of British machine-made lace left for the home market as  1,847,000. Thus it would seem that some 73 per cent, of the total make-in the United Kingdom was exported, leaving 27 per cent, for the home market. The extent of the home market in 1907 for both British and foreign lace can be inferred from a consideration of the statistics relating to the import and re-export of foreign and colonial merchandise, if allow-ance be made for the appreciation in the value of goods exported after being imported. Proceeding in this manner, we have arrived at the conclusion that the home trade had a value round about  3,750,000, and that in consequence about half of the demand of the United Kingdom in 1907 was supplied directly by the British industry. These figures.dp not take account of the export to Switzerland and Germany of the cotton net which, after being embroidered or otherwise worked upon in those countries, was re-imported into this country. We have dealt with this question in some detail because we consider that in.face of the considerable export figures there may be a tendency to belittle the value of the home market. . .14. It is, however, abundantly clear- that the state of the export trade is an important index to the condition of the industry, and it will be seen from the following figures that the export trade is suffering at present from a very severe depression.Exports9 from the United Kingdom of Lace and Articles thereof, made of Cotton, Silk and.Silk mixed with other materials (if known as &quot; Silks &quot;&apos;). -   ,    -	(Abstracted from the		Trade Ret	trns of the	United Kingdom.)

The first years of the war witnessed a considerable reduction. The recovery from 1916 onwards cannot-be taken at face value as it must be regarded in the light of the advance of prices which then occurred. Even the year 1920, which appears to show a remarkable expansion, was well below the pre-war standard in regard to the quantity of lace exported. When allowance.is made for the advance in present prices over pre-war prices, it will be realised that the situation, of the export trade from the end of 1920 onwards has been disastrous. The temporary boom in 1919 and the early part of 1920 had serious consequences for the industry, for lace mn,nu-factnrers presumed that it was the initial stage of a period of trade activity, during which the stocks depleted during the war years would be replaced. The lace industry, like others, has suffered from optimistic buying and we are informed that some of the contracts-for yarnsplaced at highindprices are still unliquidated.   Excepting such products as mosquito nets, &quot;thei-hy was not&apos;concerned in the production of war material, and was not in a position&apos;to41971 B
make profits and build up reserves during the war period so as to enable it to meet the post-war slump.15. During our visit to Nottingham we saw rows of idle machines and every evidence of stagnation of trade. Indeed, it was stated in evidence that, the majority of the small makers and finishers had reached the end of their resources, and that a collapse of some magnitude, which had been averted a year ago only by the banks agreeing to support the trade for a further period, might be expected within the next few months.16. The following statistics were supplied relative to the number of machines now in the industry as compared with the number in 1912/13 : Type of machine.

We were informed that 79 of these had been sold abroad. It was, moreover, stated in evidence that the number of firms engaged in the LeaverVlace section of the trade in Nottingham and the surrounding district had fallen from some 300 in 1914 to about 205 in 1923, so that the average number of machines per firm has increased.17.

The only comparative official figures are those furnished by the Ministry of Labour, which show that the estimated number of Insured Contributors under the Unemployment Insurance Acts who were registered as workers in the lace industry in Great Britain were as follows.   The figures are exclusive of certain classes of workpeople who are not insurable (eg., juveniles under 16, outworkers, and persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour at a rate of remuneration exceeding in value  250 per annum).

The table in Appendix B gives the numbers and approximate percentages of males and females unemployed in the lace industry and the numbers working systematic short time tn such a way as to qualify for unemployment benefit. Attention is drawn to the high per-centage of unemployment among males.19. Evidence regarding unemployment was submitted by officials of trade union organizations. We were told by them that by May, 1920, periodical cessation of work had become general, and firms which ran continuously carried on with a greatly reduced number of workers; at the present time, unemployment appears to become worse with each succeeding month. For example, operatives employed in punching jacquard cards for Leavers lace machines, who were hardly ever out of employment before the war, are working only part time, obtaining from one to three days work per week at some firms and &quot; beins scarcely employed at all for weeks&quot; at others. Under the present state of unemployment, trade unions have been compelled for the first time to suspend the payment of unemployment benefit owing to exhaustion of funds, and workers are living on and gradually exhausting their small savings. Cases were mentioned of men engaged in the&apos;gradual purchase of theuhouses who had had to apply for Poor Law relief. Thei depression is clearly touching a type of worker who nanormal times would be in almost constant employment. The younger people, we were informed, were seeking work at other trades.   The Mayor of Nottingham told us that, not-
withstanding an increase in the total number of students attending the Art School, the number of those taking the courses especially provided for lace trade workers had never been so small, and that parents were now declining to send their children to a trade in which the outlook seemed so black.20. After reviewing the export figures, the statistics supplied by the Ministry of Labour and the evidence given by manufacturers and representatives of the trade unions, we are of the opinion that the prevalent unemployment in the laoe industry is abnormal. It is impossible to compute the loss to the State consequent on the enforced idleness of the workers in the industry; but if the question is viewed merely from the standpoint of the payments of out-of-work benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, it will be seen that the financial loss under this one heading is considerable. The following, figures, relative to the lace trade in England and Wales only, have been supplied to us by the Ministry of Labour, for the period, November, 1920 to June, 1923.Income from Contributions.       .    .......      130,000.......        46,890(i.)

That thexe is a great falling off in the world&apos;s demand for lace may be gathered not only from our own. export returns relating to machine-made laces, the figures of which have already been referred to by us in paragraph 14 above, but also from the trade returns of foreign countries. The imports into the United States, for example, of machine-made cotton laces (which form a material proportion of all the laces imported into that country) tell the same story, as is shown by the following figures abstracted from the Trade Returns of the United States : 	1913,			-	Year ended	1920.	1921.	1922.

Having regard to the general rise in prices of machine-made laces, the reduction in quantity must be much greater than is shown by the figures of value measured in dollars. It is, perhaps, germane to record that the United States were credited with the possession of only some 600 Leaver&apos;s machines in 1917; and although the imports of British lace and net machines into- that country steadily increased over the years 1920 to 1922, it seems unlikely that the United States are yet in a position to supply any considerable propor-tion of their total demand of Leaver&apos;s laces. If we turn from the total figures to the figures relating to the countries from which the exports came it will be seen that France, so far as value is concerned, has relatively fared much better than this country, a result which may be in part, at least, due to the greater cheapness of French laces, owing, to the fact which we refer to below, that labour costs in France have not risen in proportion to the depreciation of the French franc as measured in gold.22. Since the United Kingdom enjoys a small preference over France and other foreign countries in the Canadian market, we think it is desirable to&apos; give the following figures relating to lace imports from France, Germany, China and this country into Canada, which have been extracted from the Canadian Trade Returns : A.

The year ending Match, 1922, witnessed a serious fall in. the post-war imports of white or cream-coloured cotton lace from the United Kingdom, but broadly speaking, over the whole of the imports covered by the table, the relative position of this country is not badly maintained. On the whole, the same might be said of the French imports into Canada. The remarkable feature is the post-war position of the United States, which compares very favourably with the pre-war figures. This may possibly be due to the re-export of laces imported into the United States. In regard to the Canadian market, it is of interest to note that a treaty has recently been concluded between France and Canada which has had the effect of conceding to France lower tariff rates than those previously existing and thus reducing the advantage which the United Kingdom manufacturer formerly enjoyed over his French competitor. The above statistics regarding imports into the United States and Canada must, however, be read with caution, since it does not follow that because consignments are credited to a particular country they were necessarily manufactured therein.23. The reduction in the world&apos;s demand for lace manufactures must in a great measure be it scribed to change of fashion in ladies&apos; dress. Undergarments, which-were formerly trimmed with lace edgings, are now, we are informed, almost universally made without trimmings of lace, and the lace petticoat has disappeared. It is true, on the other hand, that a fashion has arisen for lace flounces and dresses, but this fashion, owing to the cost involved, is at present confined to the few, while the lace edgings, in the manufacture of which Nottingham excels, were much more generally worn.24. Another cause for the reduction of demand may be found in the decrease of purchasing power in this country and in all the European countries as a result of the war and the conse-quent curtailment of articles of luxury. Some countries Germany and other Central European powers and Ecuador were particularly mentioned have taken steps to restrict the import of articles of luxury, among which lace and net ha.ve been included, and sometimes official permits, difficult to obtain, are required before the Government will allow the sending of remittances out of the country.25. In respect of the export trade from the United Kingdom, we were informed that the stimulus of the temporary boom induced buyers to place large orders for lace goods up to the early part of 1920. Immediately the slump was felt, however, customers refused to take deliveries of goods which had already been despatched, and they cancelled contracts and orders, thus leaving large quantities of goods in! the hands of exporters, for the consequent loss upon which adequate provision had not been made. At the same time, merchants were unable to dispose of their stocks and thus procure the funds which would have enabled them to discharge their liabilities for goods already received.26. The situation was rendered still more difficult by the depreciating currency of certain foreign countries, as debts falling due some time after the day on which the orders had been placed had increased in amount according to the rate of depreciation of the cun-ency in question. In general, we may say that we have evidence showing that the foreign debts due to British lace exporters reach a considerable figure.27. Reference was made by witnesses to the increase of tariffs in some foreign countries on imported lace goods. The most serious modification is that which has taken place in. the United States under what is known as the Fordney tariff; this increased the duties on lace curtains, nets, &amp;o, made on the Nottingham lace curtain machine according to the quality of the lace from 30, 40 or 45 per cent, ad valorem to a minimum of 60 per cent, and increased the duties on other laces, lace curtainis gixid lace articles from 60 per cent, to 90 per cent ad valorem. Reference to Appendix A makes clear, however, that although the export ot cotton lace goods to the United States during the first nine months of this year (reckoned on a value basis) is appreciably smaller than the export during 1922, the greater proportion a the post-war reduction occurred in 1921, before the introduction of the. new (Fordney) tan which came into force in September, 1922.28. Our attention was repeatedly drawn by witnesses to the French import duties on lace. On looking into the matter we find that the French tariff, which is expressed in FrpruM francs per 100 kilogs., has been multiplied by 4.4 in the case of machine-made lace and to) differing amounts in the cases of other kinds of lace.   Having regard, however, to pie
346increase in the price of lace goods and the depreciation of the franc, we are not disposed to think that the incidence of the duty&apos;has been materially affected.29. Tire German duties have been increased, but the importance of this fact has been overshadowed in the case of this country by the restrictions on imports referred to in para-graph 24 above. Some other foreign countries also have increased their tariffs, and although the actual increase has in most cases not been of a specially remarkable character and the amount of the trade involved has not been great, the cumulative effect of such increases may well be considerable. It is noteworthy that, in the case of Belgium and the Netherlands, where the Customs duties have not been increased, the exports have relatively been well maintained. Of British possessions, Australia, India and South Africa have increased their tariffs, in the first two cases to 15 per cent, from 10 and 5 per cent, respectively, and in. the last case to 17 per cent, from 12 per cent, ad valorem. The Canadian pre-war tariff rates on British goods were 12J and 25 per cent, ad valorem, according to the nature of the goods. The smaller rate has remained unchanged up to the present date, but under an Act of 30th June, 1923, a discount of 10 per cent, is now allowed on the duty of 25 per cent.30. Of the reduced world demand for lace, the manufacturers in this country are not at present securing the proportion of the trade which they enjoyed before the war in foreign markets. This we think is mainly due to the greater cheapness of the foreign goods, whether made in Prance, germany or China. China, we were informed, is able, owing to what one witness described as appalling conditions of sweating, to offer hand-made laces in. competition with the machine-made laces of other countries. It was stated in evidence that both Prance and Germany are able to undersell our manufacturers owing to the fact that labour costs have not risen in proportion to the depreciation of the exchange. A witness who is a Director of a large British firm of lace exporters which has houses in Nottingham and Calais and deals in! both British and French laces, told us that of the orders obtained at present from the United States by his firm some 85 to 90 per cent, went to the French manufacturer, and that the disproportion was entirely due to the French laces being cheaper than the British.31. Before leaving the question of foreign competition in the markets of the world, we think it desirable to mention two points which were touched upon by witnesses. In the first place, it was asserted that the British manufacturer is handicapped by the American and English shipping companies who charge 95s. per measurement ton for British lace shipped from Southampton to New York, whilst carrying Calais laces over the same journey for 40s. We understand that the reason given by the companies is that they are compelled to reduce their price to the lower level in order to compete with the. French shipping lines. We have no figures which would enable us to estimate the value at the present time of a measurement ton of lace, but in 1915-16, when prices were lower than they are to-day, we understand that a number of independent tests were made which established that the average value was then about  190 per ton.32. The other point was that when duties are levied, as in the United States, on an ad valorem- basis, the exporting country whose goods are manufactured at the lowest price pays the lowest duty on a given quantity of goods, and thus obtains an added advantage over competing countries.33. As regards the home market, there was a consensus of opinion among witnesses that a considerable proportion of the laces sold at present in this country are of foreign origin, being mainly French and German. The total imports of laces and also the re-exports of imported laces are given in the following table : Imports into and Re-exports from the United Kingdom of Lace and Articles thereof, made of Cotton, Silk and Silk mixed with other materials (if known as &quot; Silks &quot;).(Abstracted from the Trade Beturns of the United Kingdom.)Year.Imports.Cotton Nets, Curtains and Lace.Silk Lace and Mixed (Silk andother materials)Lace.Total.Re-exports.Cotton Nets, Curtains and Lace.Silk Lace and mixed (Silk andother materials)Lace.Total.1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 1919 1920 1921 19221923f Jan. to June J inclusiveI July to Sept.inclusive 2,541,710 2,539,402 2,453,580 2,292,823 1,448,970 930,879 813,105 464,297 534,255 953,222 242,818 1,293,952 1,079,582 669,295407,929 257,353 284,065 354,074 429,446 307,216 37,671 21,319 3,310 188 19,174 18,891 345,466 399,029 197,836121,299 2,799,063 2,823,467 2,807,654 2,722,269 1,756,186 968,550 834,424 467,607 534,443 972,396 261,709 1,639,418 1,478,611 867,131529,228 1,352,894 1,196,249 1,191,895 1,225,910 882,483 665,898 554,519 374,145 404,854 743,601 889,539 1,158,837 888,917 523,545333,068199,985 188,947 152,373 193,806 183,981 46,179 79,580 66,559 32,101 72,218 251,728 243,338 115,038 23,9068,95544971 1,552,879 1,385,196 1,344,268 1,419,716 1,066,464 712,077 634,099 440,704 436,955 815,819 1,141,267 1,402,175 1,003,955 547,451342,023b 3
These figures, it was pointed out to us, do not include imports by parcel post, which are claimed to be considerable in volume, and they have been further criticised on the ground that they fail to make allowance for certain imports which when they entered the country were classed as embroideries, but when exported were declared as lace. There are no -means of ascertaining the total imports by parcel post or of testing the accuracy of the criticism above referred to, but comparisons of figures of imports and i&apos;e-exports extending over the period 1915 to 1920 show clearly that there must have been some errors, even if allowance is made for the increased value of re-exports. The figures show, in the six years of the period a total import of  4,039,129 and a re-export of  4,180,921. Of these totals, the imports of cotton laces amounted to  3,938,576 and the re-exports to  3,632,556, the imports of silk laces being  100,553 and the re-exports  548,365. Tn the circumstances we do not think it possible to make any exact estimate of the amount of imported luce which is retained for home consumption. On the other hand, the figures in the table, together with the evidence show that the home market has seriously contracted, and that since the year 1920 the foreign manufacturer has steadily improved his position in it; and we are of opinion, that to-day lie is actually displacing the British manufacturer. Again, the major portion of the retained imports are laces such as dress and lingerie trimmings, and it is this section of the industry which has experienced the worst of the prevailing depression.34. The bulk of the imports into this country was formerly and is still obtained from France -and Germany as shown by the following table : Imports into the United Kingdom of Lace and Articles thereof, made of Cotton, Silk and Silk mixed with other materials (if known as &quot; Silks &quot;).(Abstracted from the Trade Returns of the United Kingdom.) 	1913.	1920.	1921.	1922.	19 Jan. to June inclusive.

Notwithstanding a steady growth of the German supply in the post-war; period, our imports of cotton lace are still mainly supplied by France, while silk and &quot; mixed &quot; lace imports are almost wholly derived from that country.35. The experience of witnesses engaged in the purchase of lace differed. One ma-nu-facturer of underclothing informed us that to-day he uses approximately 25 per cent. Notting-ham laces as against 75 per cent. Calais laces, whereas a few years ago the ratio was reversed. His evidence was supported by that of a large wholesale lace buyer, but another underclothing-manufacturer stated that the value of his purchases of lace from Nottingham had increased year by year since 1920. The reason for. this diversity, we discovered, lay mainly in the different kinds of lace used or bought by the several witnesses. It was freely admitted that, although certain styles of lace could be made better by the Nottingham than by the Calais manufacturer^ the converse might equally be true in respect of other styles. We were, however, anxious to determine what is at present the deciding factor when a buyer has to choose between Calais.and Nottingham productions, and for this reason we have considered the effect of price, design, quality and novelty on saleability.36. Broadly speaking, the manufacturers urged that they were being displaced belli in the home and the foreign market by the cheaper productions of France and Germany, while for the most part the merchants, buyers and retailers of lace contended that the British laces compared unfavourably with those manufactured abroad in novelty and design..37. The lace trade covers a very wide range of production-from what is known as an extreme novelty at one end of the scale to the staple lines, such as are used for lingerie and children&apos;s frocks, at the other. The term novelty, as applied to lace, is difficult to define; it covers the productions by machine of copies of real lace for the purposes of a. particular fashion, and it is also applied to laces in, which new effects are produced by the use, of special material such as tinsel and artificial silk.

This branch of the trade calls for originality, artistic sense and enterprise, and it was suggested to us that the Nottingham manufacturers had not given proof of the possession of these qualities; that they copied when they should originate. We have had before us samples of foreign laces of the type under discussion which certainly showed a high level of artistic excellence, but we wish to record that within a narrower range the Nottingham manufacturers have shown us some very meritorious productions. The opinion was several times expressed by witnesses that the British lace maker must produce novelties if he wished to revive the lace trade, the theory being that the taste and demand for lace in general would be renewed by first interesting the dress designers who set the fashion; that, indeed, the novelties of to-day would become the staple lines of to-morrow. On the other hand, a large British manufacturer assured us that every endeavour had beer, made by his firm during the past two years to bring out novelties, but indicated that the Nottingham manufacturer had been repeatedly discouraged by his inabihty to produce laces at as low at price as the foreign manufacturer.40. The novelty class, although important, is only a small part of the whole industry, and it now remains to consider the staple hues. In some of these, the Nottingham manufacturer appears still to be capable of holding his own against foreign competition, but in regard to the goods hi which he has perhaps more particularly specialised, the Valenciennes and other lingerie laces, the foreign producer is gaining the upper hand. Some witnesses, representative of the merchant and retail side of the trade, suggested that the foreign productions were on the whole of greater merit from the viewpoint of design, but they admitted that, in goods of this class, price was the dominant factor, and the evidence we have received has left no doubt in our minds that the British manufacturer, who before the war obtained his share of the lace trade of the world, is to-day consistently undersold both at home and abroad by his foreign competitors, except in certain special lines. A number of priced samples were. submitted to us showing laces of staple types as closely similar as possible from British and from foreign manufacturers. The following table serves to indicate the relation between the cost of production, or, in some cases, wholesale price, of the British samples, and the wholesale prices in this country of the comparative foreign samples In each case, the British cost or price is given as 100 and the foreign price as a proportionate figure.44971B 438. The trade which provides the leading Paris couturiers with the lace for their&apos; new models is of small volume and catered for by few manufacturers, but many, both in Notting-ham and Calais, are capable of supplying the next stage of the demand when variants of the new fashion are being made in quantity. It is important to them to know the tendencies of fashion at the earliest possible moment, in order that they may proceed with the production of laces in the accepted style. Por this purpose, Nottingham manufacturers have endeavoured to keep in close touch with the great fashion houses of Paris, but since the war, we understand, they have not been so successful in this respect, and the Nottingham manufacturer (although knowing-, and being capable of producing what is required) is unable to sell his productions. This is a matter of some importance, as the buyers of novelty laces desire goods associated in some way with Paris, or which have been seen on Paris models. It is clear that, in respect of trade of thei character just described, the Calais manufacturer is in a favourable position as compared with the British manufacturer; he is nearer Paris, and he speaks the same language and is of the same race as the user or buyer in that City ; and though a reasonable difference in price does not affect the sale of a novelty, the smaller price of Calais productions acts even in this branch of the trade as an additional handicap to the British manufacturer. The practical importance of this trade lies in the opportunity it gives of forecasting what will be required in quantity and in the fact that buyers, when purchasing staple lines, tend to deal with the houses where they obtain, the novelties. As the total number of machines capable of producing very fine laces is not great, the competition between manufacturers of these goods in normal times is not so keen as between the producers of staple lines.39. With regard to the second class of novelties, new effects were produced by Nottingham in the so-called radium laces. Similarly, it is interesting to note that, in a generally depressed market for lace goods, the development of tinsel laces in France has apparently created a new demand. The following figures abstracted from the French Trade Returns indicate the growth of the exports from France of silk or floss silk lace mixed with real or imitation gold or silver : -

In this case the values in columns 4 and 5 are strictly comparative, being tlienett factory cost of production without profits. Note y. In all cases, except that of Sample F, the prices of the foreign laces are the manufacturers&apos; wbole-sale prices.   Conversions from French to British currency, when necessary, have been made on the basis of an exchange rate of 75 francs to the  , except in the case of Sample C for which a rate of 72 was used.In i connection with these samples, a witness drew our attention to the fact that when the weight of yarn m a pattern was small and the amount of labour involved per yard relatively lngh, as in the G-imped Valenciennes lace of Sample B, the foreign manufacturer was usually able to quote a price considerably below that of the British producer. In only two cases out of the 34 covered by the above table was the selling price of tbe foreign lace higher than the figure given for the comparative British lace (which in each of these cases was the cost of production); these were artificial silk laces manufactured in Austria and sold through Switzerland.41. We have examined comparative detailed costings relating to the present day of a type of lace which is manufactured both at Nottingham and at Calais and we find that, while the cost of the yarn in both places was substantially the same, the labour costs at Nottingham were about double those at Calais. We have endeavoured to obtain general infonnation concerning the relation between wage-rates in Nottingham and in Calais for the pre-war and the post-war periods, but we have found great difficulty in seeming reliable figures, especially for tbe pre-war period. The practice of paying for the work by piece, and the prevailing system of making a series of allowances for variations in the character of the work done, renders accurate comparison extremely difficult. Nevertheless, on the information before us, we have no hesitation in saying that, while the pre-war; rates of wages in both places were round about the same level, the present Calais wage rates, converted into sterling, at the rate of 75 francs to the  , are very much below those ruling at Nottingham. Certain British lace manufacturers who gave evidence drew attention, to the fact that the wages paid in Nottingham in the &apos;&apos; finishing &apos;&apos; section of tbe lace trade are governed by Trade Board rates, and, while expressly disclaiming any desire to have these rates reduced, they contended forcibly that, since the State imposes such restrictive conditions on the British lace industry, it should also take steps to shield the industry from the unfair competition of the foreign manufacturer who pays a much smaller wage than that laid down in this country by the Trade Board. It was alleged that clipping the process of removing superfluous threads-had always been paid at a low rate in Prance, and we were also informed that although there are recognised rates for the finishing processes in Calais, a considerable number of the lace manufacturers there pay pin-money to their families for this work, thus increasing the handicap on the Nottingham manufacturer. This is a consideration of weight in the case of those machine-made laces in which a good deal of clipping is necessarv. As an example., we may mention a case in which clipping (at Nottingham) actually added 50 per cent, to the cost already incurred in manufacturing the lace in the brown. &quot; If, as seems to he the case, the French manufacturer pays wages considerably below our basic Trade Board rates for this operation, it is clear that the British lace maker is at a serious disadvantage. French wage rates and the prices of French lace have been advanced from time to time, but we are of the opinion that the adjustments which have taken place do not correspond to the decrease

Further, our attention was drawn to the fact that competition was anticipated from Caudry in addition to that of Calais. We were informed that, of the machines at Caudry, about half were destroyed during the war, and that, in assisting&apos; the manufacturers to obtain machines, it had been the policy of the French Government to refuse aid to those who acquired old machines or machines below a certain size. As a result, there are in Caudry to-day 400 new machines of modern type, and 400 machines with new insides. British machine manufacturers have had a considerable share in th-3 provision of this new machinery. No less than 274 lace and net machines were supplied from this country to France at a cost of  703,514 during the years 1920 and 1921 only,* but this trade is now greatly reduced, the value of the machines exported to France in the period from January to July, 1923, inclusive, being only  1,107. The extent of the dependence of the French lace industry on British machines indicated by these figures is&apos;a handsome testimony to the British manufacturers&apos; capacity to produce the most modern types of machinery, and it is to be noted that the lace-machine manufacturer has worked in close touch with the lace manufacturer in this country.44. The manner in which the small lace makers obtain their designs was outlined in paragraph 11; the large manufacturer employs one or more designers. Many of the designs are reproductions of, or are inspired by, samples of real lace. The Nottingham designer has-at his disposal many facilities for the inspection of such samples. There is a large collection in the Nottingham Castle Museum, the local School of Aft possesses a library of laces, and a collection of fine lace is loaned to the trade by the Victoria and Albert Museum. We were glad to learn also that the Federation of Lace and Embroidery Employers&apos; Associations is working with the School of Art and University College at Nottingham to co-ordinate the instruction iu the manufacture and sale of lace given at those centres with* Separate returns of the exports of-lace and net machinery are not available for years prior to 1920. 44971 b 5in the gold value of French currency, and that in consequence the French lace manrifacturer-has an advantage in our market and elsewhere in competition with our manufacturers. This point is supported by the experience of large wholesale buyers of lace. We have thought it unnecessary to consider in detail the question of wages and costs of production in Germany, as.&quot; on the one hand., it is generally recognised that her depreciating exchange rate has afforded her an economic advantage, and, on the other, recent German currency fluctuations make statistical computations impracticable. In addition to the above considerations, the-fact of depreciation is now being used as an advertisement, especially by Continental manufacturers and large British retail houses, and we are of the opinion that the effect of this is to produce the impression, often fallacious, on wholesale buyers and retail customers that it is not worth while to consider British goods in comparison with those manufactured in a country in which the exchange rate is below par, and the tendency to purchase abroad is thus increased.42. These conclusions in regard to the prices of staple lines are applicable to novelty goods, although not to the same extent. That is to say, the dearer the materials used in the production of a lace and the more exclusive the design produced, the less are the labour costs of manufactme likely to affect the total cost of production., and, therefore, the selling price. It must, however, be remembered that lace productions are particularly liable to imitation in inferior materials and in a poorer quality of work, and that the bulk of the trade resulting from the initiation of a particular novelty might well be that carried on in the imitations. In consequence, the price factor, and therefore, the cost of production, must be regarded as of importance throughout the entire trade.43. Before leaving the subject of foreign competition in the home market, we desire to draw attention to the striking change which occurred during the years 1920 and 1921 in the lace trade balance between France and this country. The following table, compiled from..-the. Trade Returns of the United Kingdom, shows the variation in the cotton lace trade, between the United Kingdom and France and the United Kingdom and Germany.
the needs of the industry. We may say that during the whole course of our inquiry there have been no criticisms levelled against the technique and durability of British laces, and it is clear that the technical equipment and potentialities of the Nottingham lace industry reaoh a high standard.45.. To summarise our views on the subject of the causes of the unemployment in the British lace industry : we are of the opinion that the demand for lace throughout the world has seriously contracted, mainly owing to the following causes : (i) change of fashion in dress, probably accelerated by circumstances arising out of the war; and(ii) decrease in purchasing power and trade dislocations following on the trade shram of 1920; ,&apos; 1and that the British industry is suffering also from(iii) increase of foreign tariffs, and prohibition or control of certain imports by someforeign countries; and(iv) foreign competition, especially French, German and Chinese, in the restrictedforeign and home markets, assisted in the first two cases by the depreciated currencies of the countries in question, and in the third case by the low wage standards prevailing.(d) OBGANIMATION OF THE  BRITISH LACE INDUSTRY.46. We have considered the organization of the British lace industry described in paragraphs 8 to 11 above, with a view to determining whether it is efficient.47. We understand that the tenement system is a feature of the lace industry not only in Nottingham but also in Calais, and it, therefore, does not enter into the question of the comparative costs of production at these centres. The -Report of the Committee on the Position of the Textile Trades after the War records certain adverse criticisms against the hire purchase system, mentioned in paragraph 9 above, under which many small lace makers in Nottingham acquire their machines (see Appendix C), and its limitations in a time like the present, when the industry is almost at a standstill, are only too apparent. Nevertheless, it is to be remembered that a considerable number of successful lace makers started business in this way, and commencing with a few machines, have gradually increased the size of their plant to considerable dimensions.48. It is true that the size of the average firm making Leavers lace is small and the available capital in many firms is not great. Of 128 firms in the Nottingham district, more than one-half have eight machines or less; the average number is slightly under 11. There - is no doubt that the ratio of overhead charges to other manufacturing costs is reduced when a lace factory is increased in size, and there is the probability that a lace firm would be able to pay higher wages and thus secure better designers if then work could be spread over a greater production. On the other hand, the lace industry is one in which the principles of mass production cannot be applied thoroughly. Artistic merit is undoubtedly a factor of great importance, and it seems likely that a small firm which has access to a talented designer may well be capable of holding its own against a larger firm not so happily circumstanced. In industries, like that of lace production, in which artistic considerations and creative ability are important, it seems desirable to aim at a form of organization which allows for the ingress of the individual with new ideas and enterprise, and not to attempt to model development on lines which have been found successful in industries of a more utilitarian character.49. In the commercial (as distinct from the technical) organization of the industry, we feel that there is need for improvement. Buyers of finished laces who gave evidence urged that they found it difficult to get into contact with the actual maker of British lace and thus to have their special requirements and suggestions speedily and adequately considered, and they contrasted this situation unfavourably with that obtaining at Calais. In paragraph 8 above, we explained the specialized form of manufacture usual in Nottingham, which entails the making of lace in the brown by one firm and the finishing and mei-chanting of it by another. In Calais, on the other hand, it appears to be the general rule for the maker to finish antl sell his productions. The suggestion of the lace buyers was that the British lace finisher acted as a buffer between the maker and the buyer and hindered business. It is clear, we think, that although there may be disadvantages there are also advantages in the separation of the two. processes; the large Nottingham finisher is able to obtain patterns from a number of makers and thus to present a much more comprehensive range of goods to a prospective buyer. The disadvantage is clearly in the want of flexibility. We doubt very much whether there is any advantage in one system over the other in regau to the cost of production. The number of firms, however, engaged wholly or partly m lace finishing (about 280) appears to be high as compared with the number of makers (abou 235). . In many cases these lace-finishing firms are quite small, and the small finisher seems to us to be a weakness in the industry. Greater co-operation between the lace maker an the lace finisher in Nottingham is, we think, needed with a view to rendering possiD a closer study of the buyer&apos;s requirements, the establishment of relations between the buy of the finished product and the maker of lace, and the creation of means whereby samples, especially of novelties, can be brought speedily before the notice of the retail houses.
50. The large lace finishing and the exporting houses perform the useful function of financing the trade. AA7e were informed, that the latter are prepared to take risks in doubtful or distant markets which even a large firm of lace manufacturers engaged directly in the export trade would not be prepared to undertake.   In Calais the same system obtains.51. We think it will be clear from the foregoing remarks on the organization of the industry that there is little danger of the imposition of a duty on imported lace leading to the formation of a trust or ring. In fact, the situation which our investigations has disclosed appears to err rather on the side of being too aggressively competitive and. secretive.(e) Publicity.52. It has been strongly impressed upon us. in the course of our inquiry that the ultimate purchaser is in reality only in a position to choose from a selection of lace which itself is the result of a series of previous selections undergone at each stage of the process of manufacturing and merchanting the goods. The maker has to satisfy the finisher and he, in turn, the wholesale buyer. The retail buyer makes a further selection before the goods are displayed to the consumers; their choice is thus limited and the fashion is out of their control. One witness alluded to the difficulties caused in trades largely influenced by fashion by too frequent and too drastic changes, and it was suggested that under modern conditions fashion might be so controlled as to provide a steady demand over a long period of years. Such control would necessitate the unremitting employment of properly managed means of publicity. Spasmodic advertising would evidently be valueless. Action on these lines is outside the recognised functions of Government, but it is a question which might receive the careful consideration of the lace industry. Evidently a scheme of this character eould be carried out only if there was real co-operation between the different parts of the industry. In connection with the question of publicity, it is relevant that Nottingham having been associated so closely with the lace curtain trade, the fact is, perhaps, imperfectly realised that the Leavers or fancy lace trade of the City under normal circumstances is a much larger part of the industry. This is one of the misconceptions which should be remedied by any publicity scheme undertaken.(/) Remedies Suggested.53. A number of proposals designed to remedy the situation have been placed before us.   They are as follows : (a) that a duty should be imposed on all lace imported into the country (not includingplain nets and curtains), whether hand or machine made;(b) that a subsidy should be granted on exports from the country; and(o) that an attempt should be made through diplomatic channels to secure :  (i) a reduction in foreign tariffs,(ii) an increase in the preferential rates of duty accorded by the OverseasDominions; and(iii) the removal of prohibitions upon the importation of lace and nets.into certain foreign countries.54.   We have considered all these proposals : (a) As regards the proposal to impose a duty on imports of lace, we have stated our recommendations in paragraph 55 below.(6) As regards the grant .of a subsidy on exports; the proposal is so much at variance with British practice and policy, and the difficulties which would attend its administration are so obvious, that we cannot recommend any legislation, on these fines. It may be pointed out against the proposal, if any further argument is necessary, that several foreign countries (including the.United States) have - i provisions in their tariff legislation enabling them to deal specially with bounty-fed imports.(c) Nor does it appear to us that we can make any useful recommendation with regardto the proposals under the heading (a), for we are confident that His Ma,jesty&apos;s Government are fully alive to the importance of securing as complete openings as possible for the trade of the United Kingdom. 55. To return to proposal (a), the export trade is of far greater importance to the Nottingham lace industry than the home market, and &quot;the imposition of a duty on imports would not directly benefit the export trade. We believe, however, that a degree of protective assistance in the home market for a limited period of time to counteract the abnormal factors operating against them will serve to put fresh courage into the Nottingham manufacturers, and an increase of their sales in this country should enable them to reduce their fixed charges and thus improve their position as competitors in the lace trade in foreign countries. We accordingly recommend that a duty of 33J per cent, ad valorem should be imposed for a period of at least five years on imported lace of all kinds, of cotton, silk, or other fibre, whether made by machine or by hand, and whether forming part of or attached to garments or other articles, or not, and also on all products of the Leaver&apos;s lace, the lace curtain, the lace net, and the. circular lace machine, whether termed lace or not. In arriving at this com-prehensive definition, we have been influenced by the fact that, while the imports of cotton net and curtains form only a very small proportion of the total cotton lace imports (in 1922,
they amounted to 3 per cent.), the&apos;administrative difficulties arising out of their exclusion from the scope of any duty which is imposed would be considerable. Also, in the production of novelties, goods may be manufactured on lace machines which do not present the characteristic appearance of lace. The inclusion within the scope of the duty of lace attached to or forming part of garments or other articles would safeguard the employment of those engaged in this country in the production of articles for which lace is used.56. We have included hand-made lace in our recommendation because certain kinds enter into strong competition with machine-made lace, but it is not necessary for the protection of the British machine-made lace industry that the proposed duty should be levied ad valorem on hand-made lace of high value. We recommend, therefore, that the assessment of the value of hand-made lace for the purposes of the duty should be subject to a maximum limit, which, while adequate to protect the Nottingham industry, would not represent a serious addition to the cost of an expensive lace. This limit, for example, might be defined as a specific amount per square foot of lace ; and this amount might be based on the wholesale price of the most costly machine-made lace of the same material.57. Before coming to the conclusion arrived at in paragraphs 55 and 56 we gave careful consideration to the question whether the imposition of a duty would injure our entrepot trade in foreign-made lace, and whether it would increase the price of lace in this country and so restrict sales. In regard to the first point, it is already the case that a drawback can be claimed in respect of goods on which a duty has been paid when these are re-exported from this country; no difficulty need be anticipated in obtaining the drawback in the case of bulk orders which, could reach this country ready packed for re-export; and we suggest that the Customs authorities should devise a system to&apos; enable the merchant who carries on a small trade or one involving the breaking of bulk consignments, to secure the payment of the drawback easily and quickly, as the lace trade is one in which speed is an important consideration. As regards the second question : if a duty is placed upon imported lace, it may be assumed that the price will be thereby increased to the importer, but we are not-convinced that under the present abnormal conditions, this would mean an appreciable rise in price to the ultimate consumer. Nor should we consider an increase of retail price important in what is, even in its cheaper forms, essentially a luxury trade.58. We have kept in mind the possibility that a duty on imported lace might lead to the substitution, of certain kinds of embroidery for lace ; this matter is dealt with in the section of this Report concerned with embroidery.ig) The Need oe Urgency.59. We have pointed out that unemployment in the lace industry is clue to the combination of a number of causes. Any one of these would be serious alone. The cumulative effect appears to be producing a psychological reaction in the Nottingham lace industry which renders the sense of depression still more acute, and the consequences may be nothing short of disastrous. We feel that the industry is drifting into a position from which recovery will be impossible. We suggest, therefore, that the proposed temporary assistance of an import duty should be given at an early date in order to enable the luce industry to survive the present exceptional and abnormal period in its history.MACHINE-MADE EMBROIDERY INDUSTRY. (a) Nature, Development and Size of the Industry; its Organization.60. For the purposes of our inquiry machine-made embroidery may be considered as the product of the hand-machine, generally used in the manufacture of high-class goods, or of the shuttle-machine. In the former machine, the production of the design is controlled by a pantograph operated by the worker, who also drives the machine. The shuttle-machine is power-driven and is capable of yielding a larger output at a lower cost; in some cases the design is controlled by a pantograph as in the hand-machine, but in the automatic form this is replaced by a jacquard apparatus.61. The product of these machines may be divided Into two classes, viz. : 0) embroideries on materials such as muslin, voile, organdie and cambric, and (2) embroideries on net, which may afterwards be removed partially or wholly, or on some fabric which is afterwards eliminated by chemical or other means. While the machine operation is in both cases substantially the same, there&apos;is a considerable difference between these products, one being a decorated woven fabric, and the other to all intents and purposes a lace. The developments and improvements effected in technique have tended to separate these two classes into) distinct branches of the industry. The result is that to-day the former is typical of the Swiss production, and the latter of the lace industry associated with the town of Plauen, in Saxony.62. Compared with the lace industry, the machine-made embroidery industry in this country is of recent development. We were informed, that shuttle-machines were first installed in this country in 1884, although hand-machines had been tried in Manchester, and possibly in other parts of the country, before that year. There are to-day in this country rather more than 300 shuttle-machines,  and some 400 to 500 hand-machines.   In tlie
(b) Recent History ; Output and Unemployment.66. British manufacturers suffered during the first years of the war, but later secured large orders, and in consequence additional machinery was ordered. The success which fol-lowed was considerable, but the slump in 1920 at an early stage affected the trade, and we were informed that some up-to-date automatic machinery erected in 1920 has not yet done six months&apos; work in all. As in the case of the machine-made lace trade, the short-lived boom had&apos; serious consequences. In anticipation of an increase in the price of raw materials, manu-lacturers placed contracts for yarn at inflated prices, with the result that in the ensuing slump they found themselves in a very difficult position.67. The Ministry of Labour do not issue separate statistics relative to unemployment in the machine-made embroidery industry. The workers in the industry are mainly regis-tered under the Unemployment Insurance Acts as workers in the lace industry, but we have ho means of arriving at an estimate based on official figures of unemployment in the machine-made embroidery industry. The only indications of the situation are those contained in the evidence which we received. One witness asserted that since 1920 there had been times when as much as 90 per cent, of the machinery was standing idle. A census was undertaken by the Federation of Lace and Embroidery Employers&apos; Associations with the object of ascer-taining the position of the machine-made embroidery industry in the years 1913, 1920, 1921 and 1922. Returns were obtained from 24 firms, but six of these were unable to give pre-war figures, either because they were not in business before 1914 or because there had been a change of ownership. The results relating to 18 firms are shown in the following table. The wages and total sales for 1913 are each expressed as 100 and the corresponding figures for the other years are proportionate.Nottingham district alone, there are about 200 shuttle-machines, either pantograph-controlled or automatic, and possibly 50 to 60 hand-machines. The relative smallness of the British industry will be realised when these figures are compared with those relating to Switzerland and Saxony. We were informed that there were in Switzerland in 1920 about 5,300 shuttle-machines and 7,960 hand-machines. Saxony possesses about 6,000 shuttle-machines. In addition, the industry is carried on in the Vorarlberg district of Austria, in Czecho-Slovakia, Italy, France and the United States of America, and to a lesser degree in Belgium, Russia and&apos; Brazil. It was stated in evidence that there had been a considerable import of embroidery machines into the United States of America in recent years.63. Nottingham possesses advantages which might have been expected to lead to the rapid growth of the machine-made embroidery industry in the city and surrounding district. It has a population used to handling laces, and presumably capable of readily learning the embroidery-making processes; the nets used for the manufacture of various types of embroidery are made locally and the supply of yarn is close at hand; further, the Nottingham lace market is in touch with buyers throughout the world. It was also represented to us that Nottingham had played an important part in the origination of certain stitches which had subsequently been made use of both here and on the Continent in the production of staple lines. There is no doubt, however, that centres like St. Gall in Switzerland and Plauen in Saxony, now possess a great advantage as competitors for the world&apos;s trade in embroideries. The concentration of the industry, the possibilities of large scale production, and the improvements in technical processes which they have developed, all serve to render these districts industrially formidable, particularly in an unprotected market like that of Great Britain, It was represented to us that the position of the embroidery industry in this country had been rendered insecure by the foreign manufacturer^ practice of cutting prices in times of bad trade, and by the flooding of Great Britain with surplus stocks. It was, how-ever, generally admitted that the British manufacturer was not in a position to turn out &quot; white &quot; goods with the finish of the Swiss product, although the manufacturers urged that they had not yet been in a position to develop the industry on. a scale which would make it worth while for finishers in this country to improve the art of bleaching and finishing to the Swiss level of excellence. They are quite able to make the goods of lower quality produced in the Vorarlberg. Embroidery on net, however, forms the bulk of the output of the British industry. It was also mentioned that embroidery by machine had become to a considerable extent a cottage industry in certain countries and was carried on under labour conditions as to hours and wages which place our manufacturers in a very disadvantageous position.64. Another indication of the small size of the British embroidery industry is furnished by the statement in evidence that the 26 members of the Nottingham Embroidery Manufac-turers&apos; Association represent 85 per cent, of the manufacturers in the United Kingdom engaged in production by means of shuttle-machines and also a considerable number of those engaged in the hand-machine trade.65. The organization of the industry in the Nottingham district is similar to that of the lace industry. The finishing processes are kept separate from the making in the brown, and the tenement factory system is also used by some firms. Most of the machinery is of Swiss or German make, whereas that in the lace industry is almost entirely of British production.

Wage rates in 1921 and 1922 were much higher than in 1913, and the persons employed include many who were working short time.in the years 1913, 1921 and 1922.68. The evidence of the workers&apos; representative points in the same direction. As examples of the prevailing unemployment, he cited the following cases : One large embroidery maaiufacturmg company in Nottingham has at present only 10 per cent, of its multiple-needle machinery working, and during the last two years it has not worked more than 25 per cent, of its machines, while the workers have been on half time and less during the whole period of the depression. Another firm employing 60 machine operatives when on full time, has been able, since July, 1922, to find only half its workers a few hours&apos; employ-ment a week.(c) Causes oe the Depression in the Industry.69. It is generally recognised that there is a greatly decreased world demand for machine-made embroidery. We were informed that hem-stitching or a little hand embroidery had generally displaced the machine-made embroidery previously used. Some idea of the relation between the present demand and that in a pre-war year may be obtained from the table in Appendix D showing the exports of embroidery from Switzerland and Germany, which were the two largest sources of the world supply. The diminution in the weight of embroidery exported now as compared with that exported in pre-war times is striking. In the case of Switzerland, about 95 per cent, of the embroidery made is sent abroad, so that in this case the figures are not seriously affected by the home (Swiss) consumption of embroidery.70. We have no statistics from which to estimate the proportion between the home trade and tbe export trade in British machine-made embroideries, but, according to the evidence of manufacturers, the principal outlet for their products was the home market. During the war India became a large customer for embroidery on net. Unfortunately, the break in prices consequent on the trade slump coincided with the depreciation, in value of the rupee, and traders in India who had ordered goods found difficulties at this time in paying for them. Many orders from India for embroidery were cancelled after the goods had been made; in some cases contracts were repudiated; and manufacturers w^ere left with large stocks on their hands. The exports of embroidery manufactured in the United Kingdom were not separately recorded in the Trade Returns before 1920, but the following statistics reveal a considerable diminution in their value since that year, especially in embroidery manufactured on net and dissoluble fabric.Exports from the- United Kingdom of Machine-made Embroidery and Needlework (exceptLinen Embroidery).

71. Although the possible effect of other factors tending to &quot;decrease the British export trade, such as the increase of tariffs in other countries, was mentioned, it was made clear that in the opinion of the British manufacturer the chief cause of distress is the loss of the home market owing to the competition of the German, French and Austrian producers and to conditions now obtaining in Switzerland. Appendix E gives the imports into and the re-exports from the United Kingdom of machine-made embroidery. If the figures in this Appendix could be taken at their face value, they would suggest that the bulk of the imported embroidery on non-dissoluble fabrics is retained in this country, and that the greater part of the embroidery on net and dissoluble fabrics is disposed of overseas. We think however, that in respect of the latter form, caution must be exercised before accepting such a conclusion. In the first place, the distinction between some of these embroideries and. certain kinds of lace is not at all clear, and it is more than probable that, through faulty declarations as to the nature of consignments or through lack of uniform! treatment, the figures do not convey a correct picture of the situation. This question is of importance, as the Nottingham embroidery manufacturer is especially concerned with embroidery on net. The potential consumption of this country of all the main kinds of embroidery is very great, as is shown by the pre-war figures of imports in the United Kingdom Trade Returns and of exports in the Trade Returns of foreign countries, particularly Germany and Switzerland. The whole of this demand cannot at present be supplied by the British manufacturer. The returns in Appendix E do not take account of the imports of embroidery by parcel post. In a census of postal packages it was found that, in the period March-May, 1923, inclusive, embroidery of a value of  17,376 was imported from Germany by parcel post. This is presumably embroidery of all kinds, but when this figure is compared with that of  8,103, given in Appendix E as the value of all), machine-made embroidery and needlework (dxcept linen embroidery), imported during the period January-June, 1923, it is clear that the imports by parcel post are important. We are of opinion that, while the figures indicate the import for consumption in this country of a considerable amount of embroidery on woven fabrics, they cannot be regarded as conclusive in respect of embroideries on net and dissoluble fabrics.72. As regards the conditions under which competition is being carried on, we were informed by witnesses that in recent months the demand for embroidery workers in Plauen and district had been active, and that price cutting was in progress among embroidery firms. In Switzerland, on the other hand, there had been unemployment and distress in the industry during the past three years. The exporting firms have had part of their embroideries, principally the lower grade, produced in the neighbouring region of the Vorarlberg (Austria), where labour is much cheaper, justifying their action on the ground that only by so doing could they retain, their export trade in&apos; competition with Germany, France and Austria. This has had the effect of reducing the rates paid for work in Switzerland; the minimum stitch rates, which had been instituted and made compulsory during the war were first ignored in&apos; many cases and finally withdrawn towards the end of 1921. The tendency, we were informed, has been to drive the work from the factory to the cottage worker. In addition, the machine owner may avail himself of a moratorium in respect of debts for machinery and yarns. The Swiss Government, we understand, have also granted a subsidy to assist the industry ; this appears to be designed to help embroidery manufacturers in financial difficulties and to compensate others whose machines it is decided to seal down with a view to limiting competition; we have no information as to the effective-ness of this measure. Generally, it was represented to us that depreciated currencies were responsible for the cheaper production of embroidery by Germany, Austria and France, and that Swiss manufacturers in an endeavour to retain some share in a greatly reduced market, had been compelled by this competition to reduce the wage rates of embroidery operatives, and the Swiss Government had found it necessary to give direct assistance to the industry; the result of all these factors being an intensification of competition which the British manufacturer, working under our Factory and Trade Boards Acts, is unable to meet. It was pointed out to us that, as the embroideries made in the Vorarlberg to the order of Swiss merchants are returned to Switzerland to be finished, it is impossible to distinguish them from Swiss products.73. We have examined a number of comparative British and foreign&apos; costs of embroidery. In the following table the prices given for the foreign article are in all cases the selling prices. The estimated cost of manufacture in this country is in each case expressed as 100, and the foreign price as a proportionate figure.Type of Embroidery.	Number of Samples in Type.	British Embroidery.

14. We have no information as to foreign wages in the embroidery industry, except the time rates of wages paid in Switzerland in 1921. In that year, the Swiss rates seem to have been slightly higher than those in Nottingham, but while the Nottingham rates have been maintained up to the present clay, there has been a fall in tlic rate of wages paid in Switzerland, as stated in paragraph 72.75. To summarise our views on the subject of the causes of unemployment in the machine-made embroidery industry : We are of the opinion that the demand lor embroidery throughout the world has seriously decreased mainly owing to(i) change of fashion in dress; and(ii) decrease of purchasing power;and that the British industry is suffering also from(iii) foreign competition, resulting from, the restoration, in a restricted market of theexport trade from certain large centres aided by depreciated exchanges particularly in Germany and Austria, and the consequent lowering of prices in Switzerland.(cl) Remedies Suggested.76. A number of proposals designed to remedy the situation have been placed before us.   They are as follows :i (a) that a duty should be imposed on all embroideries imported into this country fromall countries other than Switzerland.(b) that a duty should be imposed on the following imports into this country from switzerland : (i) embroideries on net or dissoluble fabric ;(ii) embroideries on other materials, when the actual embroidering is doneoutside Switzerland; and(iii) the increased value of goods sent from this country to Switzerland to heembroidered.    (Known as &apos;&apos; Facon &quot; Embroideries.)(c) that a subsidy should be granted on exports of embroidery from this country.(d) that an attempt should be made to secure : (i) a reduction of foreign tariffs; and(ii) a preferential tariff for British-made embroideries imported into the Dominions Overseas.77. Our remarks in paragraph. 54 on the similar proposals made foil assisting the lace export trade are applicable to proposals (c) and (d) above.78. In considering the proposals (a) and (b) we have had to take into account the fact that embroideries on net and dissoluble fabrics are in many cases scarcely distinguishable from, and often sold as, lace. If, therefore, a duty is imposed on lace in accordance with the recommendation in paragraph 55 above, we feel sure that it would fail to achieve the object of assisting the home lace industry and providing employment, unless measures are taken at the same time to restrict the import of embroideries of this class. From other points of view, we are unable to recommend the imposition of an import duty on all embroidery. The industry is small and undeveloped as compared with those which have been established in. foreign countries, and it is, and would be for some years, capable of supplying only a small part of the demand of Great Britain for embroideries in general. In these respects the embroidery industry differs fundamentally from the British lace industry, which is a large well-established industry that has proved&apos;capable in normal times of maintaining its position in the markets of the world.79. We therefore recommend, as a necessary consequence to the imposition of a duty on imported lace, that a similar duty should be imposed for a like period on imports into this country of embroidery manufactured on net or dissoluble or otherwise eliminable fabric, whether forming part of or attached to garments or other articles, or not. We do not recommend a duty on embroideries on muslin, voile, organdie, cambric and other woven fabrics.80. As regards the objections which might be raised to the imposition of a duty, some of these follow the lines of those discussed in paragraph 57 above in connection with the proposed duty on lace, and the observations made therein apply equally to the case of embroidery. In addition, representations were made to us that Switzerland is an important customer of Lancashire for cloths and yarns used in the embroidery industry, and that a duty on embroideries imported into Great Britain might diminish the demand for these goods ana so reduce the trade of Lancashire. Embroideries on net and dissoluble fabrics, however, form only a very small proportion of the total exports of embroideries from Switzerland to tins country, so that the the great bulk of the Swiss trade with Great Britain would remain nn.it-fected by the duty we have proposed.
SUMMARY OR CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.81. Our conclusions and recommendations in regard to the machine-made lace and machine-made embroidery industries are as follows : (1) There has been a serious contraction in the demand for lace and embroidery through-out the world mainly owing to (2) The British lace and embroidery industries are also suffering from the following causes : (a) The lace industry: Increase of foreign tariffs, and prohibition or controlof certain imports by some foreign countries; and foreign competition, especially French, German and Chinese, in the restricted foreign and home markets ; assisted in the first two cases by the depreciated cur-currencies of the countries in question, and in the third case by the low wage standards prevailing.(b) The  embroidery industry: Foreign  competition  resulting  from  therestoration in a restricted market of the export trade from certain large centres aided by depreciated exchanges, particularly in Germany and Austria, and the consequent lowering of prices in Switzerland.(8) We recommend that a duty of 33J per cent, ad valorem should be imposed for at least five years on imports into this country of (a) lace of all lands, of cotton, silk or other fibre, whether made by machineor- by hand, and whether forming part of or attached to garments or other articles, or not, and also on all products of the Leaver&apos;s lace, the lace curtain, the lace net, and the circular lace machine, whether termed lace or not; and(b) embroidery manufactured on net- or dissoluble or otherwise eliminablefabric, whether forming part of or attached to garments or other articles, or not.Assessments of the value of hand-made lace for the purposes of the duty should be subject to a maximum limit, as indicated in paragraph 56.(4) In addition, steps should be taken by the industry to establish greater co-operation between makers and finishers for the purposes mentioned in paragraph 49.82. In conclusion of this part of our inquiry, it is a pleasure to record our grateful thanks to both the Secretaries. Their wide knowledge of textile manufactures, and the skill and ease with which they have analysed and marshalled the facts given in evidence, have been of the utmost value to us. We may add that the speed with which the inquiry lias been carried through is due in no small measure to their unflagging zeal and energy.(a) change of fashion in dress, and(b) the general decrease in purchasing power.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed)      G.

APPENDIX C.Extract from the Report of the Committee on the Position of the Textile Trades after tee Was(Od. 9070.)   (Page 98.)THE LACE AND EMBROIDERY INDUSTRIES. The Factory System.A feature peculiar to the lace trade is the tenement factory. These factories are let in &quot;shops or standings &quot; to owners of lace machines at rents inclusive of power and heating. A large proportion of the tenant/of such factories are merely the hirers of machinery which they obtain on agreement from the machine builder. This system has given rise to the existence of a large number of small makers engaged in the lace trade. By paying a deposit of, say,  100 per machine to the machinist and entering into an agreement for the payment of the balance of the cost over a term of years the would-be lace maker secures a^small plant of a few machines-three being the average number. The machine owner then instals his tenant in a tenement factory, and retains considerable power over him until full liability under the agree-ment is discharged. In the event of non-payment of instalments or of rent he is entitled to.seize, not only the machines, but all other assets of the hirer. This system is said to have serious drawbacks. We are informed that it has encouraged irresponsible production, and has led to excessive competition within the industry, and the frequent breaking of prices during times of bad trade.APPENDIX D.Exports of Certain Embroidery Manufactures from Switzerland.
