C A B, g N E T.,!p,/229(25)JUVSBILE   UEEMELO YHEffT.MSMDIUMDUM &quot;by MIiaSTEH QE LABOUR and PKSSIIKBHT of the BOARD OF EDUCATION.In a dobate on Eebruary 24th the President of the Board of Education suggested the desirability of a conference or inquiry on the subject of juvenile unemployment *   He also said that the Government were prepared to introduce legislation making attendance at Juvenile Unemployment Centres compulsory.Local Education Authorities and Employers have been consulted on this latter proposal.   A Bill has been drafted and will shortly be considered by the Cabinet Committee on Juvenile Unemployment.    S\ich a Bill will not, however, be accepted by public opinion as sufficient to meet the problem and it may, therefore, excite opposition unless it is brought into relation with a more comprehensive inquiry into the whole problem of the adjustment between education and the requirements of industry-We think it advisable, therefore, to take up the other sug-gestion made by the President of the Board of Education and to appoint a Committee of Inquiry consisting of representatives of Employers, Trades Unions, Local Education Authorities, Teachers, and Juvenile Advisory Committees under an independent Chairman. We would propose to take the advice of this committee on the Bill,   but we think that the inquiry should cover a wider ground and should extend to the general question of adjusting education to the requirements of industry.We hope that the Cabinet will authorise us to Bet up this Committee.fh Hay, 1925.A.asked.&quot;w. &quot;P
