report of   theCOMMITTEE   ON   THE   RENT   RESTRICTION   ACTS.To The Right Honourable Sir John Gilmoub, Bart., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Secretary for Scotland.Sib,1. This Committee was appointed on 28th January, 1925, the terms of reference being &quot;to inquire and report on the economic &quot;and other difficulties in carrying out the provisions of the Bent &quot;Restriction Acts which have arisen in some districts in Scotland, &quot;with a view to more efficient working during the continuation &quot;of the said Acts and to simplification of procedure under them.&quot;2. Having regard to the fact that the operation of the Acts is not confined to Scotland, and to the terms of the reference, we interpreted it to mean that we were intended to make practical recommendations for the more efficient administration of the Statutes and not to review their general policy and substantive provisions. On the other hand, we considered it desirable to allow all alleged grievances to be freely ventilated by the witnesses so long as the evidence was not excessive in amount or unduly protracted. There are accordingly various topics introduced and remedies suggested in the evidence which are obviously beyond the scope of our remit.Procedure.3. Evidence was taken from five areas in the West of Scotland, viz., Glasgow, Greenock, Paisley, the Hamilton district including Cambuslang, and the Dumbarton district including Clydebank; but the bulk of it related to Clydebank, in which the rent difficulty has been most acute. Any communications which we received from other areas in Scotland were to the effect that no particular difficulty was being experienced there in the administration of the Acts. With one exception, viz., Paisley, all the areas selected are dependent upon industries which have been heavily hit by the prevailing industrial depression Glasgow, Greenock and Clydebank on engineering and shipbuilding, and Hamilton and Cambuslang on coal mining and steel manufacture. Paisley is partly dependent on engineering, but is also largely interested in thread manufacture, which has not suffered from the depression.4. The Committee held sixteen public sittings in Glasgow, and heard evidence from sixty-four witnesses, mainly representa-tive of owners and house factors on the one hand and of labour organizations and tenants defence associations on the other. They received statements and in some cases heard evidence from Sheriff
Court officials, rating authorities municipal and parochial, and officials connected with valuation, public health administration, and the Employment Exchanges. They also received from the chief industrial firms in Clydebank, full information regarding changes in the rates of wages. They had, further, the benefit of a special investigation into social conditions in Clydebank under-taken by the Lecturer on Economics in Glasgow University and - a number of voluntary helpers.Rent Legislation.5. Before proceeding to state the result of our enquiries, it will be convenient to give a short sketch of the Bent legislation in so far as it bears upon the evidence. In considering this legislation, it must be borne in mind that in Scotland, differing from England where all rates are imposed on occupiers, the incidence of rates is partly on owners and partly on occupiers; and that by the House Letting and Bating Act of 1911 responsibility for all assessments imposed on occupiers of small dwelling houses in Scotland was also laid upon owners, who were presumably (because the Act is strangely silent on the subject) entitled to recover them from the occupiers, and, in the event of their receiving no rent from the occupiers, to reclaim the amounts from the rating authority. Small dwelling houses consisted, in burghs with a population between 20,000 and 50,000, of those having an annual value of  15 or under, and in burghs with a population over 50,000 of those having an annual value of  21 or under. The increases of rent permitted by the Bent Restriction Act of 1920 would have placed many of these houses outside the scope of the House Letting Act, and in order to prevent this result the Act of 1920 raised the limits of value by 25 per cent.6. The chief objects of the Rent Restriction Acts were to protect the tenants of certain classes of dwelling houses (1) against increase of rent, and (2) against being deprived of possession. The earliest statute for the purpose was the Rent Restriction Act, which was passed in December, 1915, and applied in Scotland to dwelling houses of an annual value not exceeding  30. Proceeding on the basis of &quot;standard rent&quot; defined (in the normal case) as the rent at which the house was let on 3rd August, 1914, it declared that any increase on standard rent should be irrecoverable except in the case of structural alterations, or in respect of occupier&apos;s rates. In Scotland the owner was left to pay any increase on his own rates without recourse.7. In 1918 a Committee presided over by Lord Hunter was appointed to consider the legislation, and the Report of the majority (1918, Cd. 9235) recommended that, subject to certain modifications, the Acts should be continued for a period of three years after the termination of the War. The suggested modifica-tions included progressive increases in rent amounting in all to 25 per cent, of the standard rent, subject to notice &quot;in simple terms&quot; to be given to the tenant, and the placing of Scottish and English owners on an equal footing by allowing the former to raise rent by the increased amount of owners&apos; rates. Following on this Report, an amending Act passed in April, 1919, extended
the principal Act in Scotland to dwelling houses having an annual value not exceeding  60; and permitted the landlord to increase the standard rent by 10 per cent, and by the amount of any increase in owners&apos; rates. But so far as the original class of houses was concerned, viz., those not exceeding  30 in annual value, the provisions did not in fact take effect until the new Bent Restriction Act came into force.8. In February, 1920, another Committee, presided over by the Marquess of Salisbury, was appointed to consider the opera-tion of the Acts, and reported in favour of their continuation, subject to certain modifications (1920, Cmd. 658). Among the modifications recommended were the extension of the Acts to houses of increased value, and permission to increase rent in stages to 40 per cent, of the standard rent, of which 25 per cent, was to meet increased cost of repairs, including &quot;some small extra &quot;provision for increased costs of management and insurance,&quot; 10 per cent, was to meet increased mortgage interest, and 5 per cent, was to give an increased return to the owner. With regard to rates in Scotland, the Committee made no recommendation, understanding &quot;that legislation is now under consideration.&quot; The Report laid particular stress on the case of tenants whose incomes had not increased since 1914, and who were unable to pay increased rents, pointing out that on account of the house famine such tenants had no power to move into cheaper houses; and it accordingly included a recommendation that the Court should have power to refuse an order for possession, and also power to reduce rent in really necessitous cases.9. Most of these recommendations were given effect to in a completely new Rent Restriction Act which was passed in July, 1920. It applied in Scotland to dwelling houses having an annual value not exceeding  90, and the period of its endurance in Scot-land was till 28th May, 1923. Adopting an additional basis of &quot;net rent,&quot; defined as standard rent less occupiers&apos; rates, it permitted increases on standard rent in respect of structural repairs and rates payable by the landlord, and in addition thereto an increase of 15 per cent, of the net rent in all cases, and a further 25 per cent, in cases where the landlord was responsible for repairs. By a provision applicable only to Scotland the rent could not be augmented by any increase in owners&apos; rates after the year ending Whitsunday, 1920. No increase in rent or rates was recoverable until the lapse of a certain period after the landlord had served upon the tenant a valid notice in writing of his inten-tion to increase the rent, and such notice was directed to be in the form contained in a schedule or in a form substantially to the same effect. The tenant might apply to the Court for suspension of the increase on the ground that the house was not reasonably fit for human habitation or in a reasonable state of repair. The form of notice appended to the Act (which we believe was hurriedly added just before the Act was passed) is of a very detailed character, and requires any increase on the rent at present payable to be analyzed into its constituent elements, with a long explanatory paragraph as to the right of the tenant to obtain suspension of the increase on account of disrepair.   A further
provision of the Act prohibited, under a severe penalty, the exaction by a landlord of any premium as a condition of the grant or renewal of a tenancy.A -further set of provisions prohibited the making of any order or judgment for recovery of possession of a dwelling house, or for the ejectment of a tenant, unless in certain carefully defined circumstances, including failure by the tenant to pay rent; and even in these cases full discretionary power was conferred, upon the Court, which was not to make the order unless it considered it reasonable. In order to enable this discretion to be exercised, the Court was authorised, either when an order was applied for or after it had been made, but not executed, to adjourn the application, to stay or suspend execution subject to such conditions as to payment of rent or arrears as the Court might think fit, and on compliance with such conditions to discharge the order. Similar provisions were applied to the levying of distress for rent, which was to be carried out only with leave of the Court.10. In November, 1922, the House of Lords, affirming the decisions of the Courts below, in the case of Kerr v. Bryde, held that notices to increase rent were not valid unless accompanied by a notice to quit. In Scotland the precaution of giving notice to quit had generally not been adopted; and the result of the decision was to invalidate retrospectively tbe increases in rents for more than two years. The situation thus arising was dealt with by the Bent Bestriction (Notices of Increase) Act passed in June, 1923, which validated such notices to the effect of enabling the landlord to recover such increases from and after 1st December, 1922, by instalments equal to 15 per cent, of the standard rent payable along with each periodical payment of rent. Payment of such instalments was only enforceable on prior notice being given in statutory form.11. Meanwhile, in 1922, another Departmental Committee, presided over by Lord Onslow, had been appointed to consider the operation of the principal Act, and had reported early in 1923 in favour of the continuance of restrictions for a limited period, and subject to various modifications. Among these modifications were a gradual process of decontrol, including the omission from any new Act of the fresh class of houses (in Scotland those of an annual value of  60 to  90) brought under restrictions in 1920; the removal of the disadvantage suffered by Scottish owners in com-parison with English owners in the matter of owners&apos; rates; and the simplification of notices of increase of rent. They called attention to the serious hardship arising from landlords being called upon, when notices were held invalid, to repay excess sums over a period extending back to 1920, and recommended that a notice to pay an,amount in excess of the legal increase should be invalid only in respect of the excess.12. Following upon this report, an amending Act was passed in July, 1923, which extended the principal Act for two more years and made various modifications, including a provision for decontrol where the landlord acquired actual possession of a dwelling house other than upon an order in respect of non-payment of rent; a provision allowing the tenant to plead want of repair as a defence
to a claim for an increase of rent; a provision authorising the Court to correct any error or omission in a notice of increase if satisfied that it was due. to a bona fide mistake on the part of the landlord; and provisions limiting the liability of the landlord for over payments made&apos; by the tenant under a notice held to be invalid, and his right, to recover arrears under an amended notice, to a period of six months. The Act contained a separate part making certain restrictions applicable after the expiry of the principal Act, including a provision that no statutory tenant in possession of a house at such expiry should be ejected therefrom if it appeared to the Court that the proceedings were harsh or oppressive, or that exceptional hardship would be caused to the tenant by an order for his ejectment. A subsequent Act, passed in July, 1924, empowered the Court, in dealing with an action for rent in the Small Debt Court, as distinguished from an action for ejection of the tenant, to attach conditions with regard to the punctual payment of instalments, and, on the failure of the tenant to comply with such conditions, to rescind or vary the order for payment by instalments, in the same way as it might deal with an action for ejection.Complexity and Obscurity of Rent Restriction Code.13. We received many complaints about the complexity and obscurity of this code of legislation, and the consequent difficulty in carrying out its provisions. The complexity of the code is materially increased by the introduction of provisions regarding rates and insanitary houses subjects which are both regulated by codes of their own. In a recent English case arising out of con-conflicting provisions in the housing code and the rent code, the Lord Chief Justice commented on the difficulty of threading his way &quot;through the labyrinth and jungle of sections and schedules&quot; (Parry v. Harding, 41 T.L.E.. 41). In Scotland special difficulties have arisen from the provisions regarding rates, the incidence of which, as we have already pointed out, is radically .different in the two countries. In particular, confusion has been caused by the treatment of occupiers&apos; rates as a component part of rent, from which they are legally quite distinct. The chief complaint is the difficulty of complying with the meticulous specification of particulars required by the statutory form of notice of increase, and the hardship and confusion arising when these are held to be invalid at a long interval after they have been issued and acted on.14. The requirements of the statutory form of notice of increase present endless opportunities for objections. In most areas litigation has been avoided by the Sheriffs refusing to sustain technical objections to notices, and by the tenants and their representatives acquiescing in the decisions. Indeed, in some places for example, Dundee the tenants, under the advice of their organization, did not take advantage of the decision in Kerr v. Bryde, and made no claim for repayment of the increases which were held to be technically invalid. But in Clydebank the adoption of the facilities which the code affords.for litigation has led to a complete irn,passe. In the words of Mr. Cormack, the legal adviser of the tenants there, &quot;The machinery of the Act has &quot;broken down, and cannot accomplish what the Act intended.
&quot;. . . I admit quite frankly that the Act is a bag of tricks, and &quot;it ought to be cleared out.&quot; It seems most inexpedient to surround one of the commonest transactions of daily life with a maze of regulations at once complicated and rigid. Apart from the loopholes which they provide for defeating the main purpose of the legislation, and the encouragement which they give to litigation, such regulations cause additional trouble and expense, which will in the end be reflected in increased demands on the tenants. The labour involved in the preparation of tables upon which to calculate permitted increases was enormous especially in a place like Glasgow, which included, for some purposes, no less than thirteen different rating areas. It is in the interests alike of landlord and tenant that the rules governing payment of rent should be as simple and as clear as possible.Rise in Rates.15. Contemporaneously with the increase of rents allowed by the Act of 1921, there occurred in all the areas: under consideration an extensive rise in the rates, both owners and occupiers. The amount is shewn in the following table, which combines parish, county, burgh, and water rates : 1918-19.				1923-24.			Owners.	Occupiers.	Total.	Owners.	Occupiers.

The result of this rise in rates was to increase materially the burden of rent to the occupier, and at the same time to diminish the benefit of the permitted increase of rent allowed to the owner. Take, for example, the position of a tenant in Clydebank who in 1914 was paying . 10 of rent.In 1914 lie paid  10 plus  2 rates      ......        12In 1924 be paid  15 rent (including  1 for permitted increase of difference between owners rates in 1913-14 and 1919-20), plus  6 rates        ..       ..        21On the other hand the net increase of rent to the owner was 4  0 0

In tbe Clyde area tbe rise in rates was considerably augmented by the prevailing unemployment and the consequent expenditure by the Parish Councils on the relief of able-bodied poor. The Beport by the Scottish Board of Health for 1923 shews (p. 245) that in that year the amount so spent represented in Greenock a rate of 2/6.3 per  , in Old Kilpatrick (which includes Clydebank) a rate of 1/11.5 per  , and in Glasgow a rate of 1/2 per  .Industrial Depression Unemployment Fall in Wages.18. Another factor which has materially affected the working of the Bent Bestriction Acts is the severe and prolonged industrial depression which has, for reasons already stated, particularly affected the Clyde area. When the Act of 1920 was passed, artificial post-war prosperity was still at its height; but in the beginning of 1921 wages began to fall, and unemployment rapidly increased. Prom the figures supplied to us by the Employment Exchanges it appears that, while all the areas in question suffered heavily during 1921, 1922, and 1923, there was considerable though unequal recovery during 1924. In Clydebank, for example, where the names on the employment register now number 21,376, there were in December, 1922, 5574 persons unemployed; but in December, 1924, the figure was reduced to 2218. In Greenock, where there are 25,700 persons on the register, there were in December, 1922, 7850 persons unemployed, but in December, 1924, the figure was reduced to 5836. In Paisley, where there are 32,400 persons on the register, there were in June, 1922, 5815 persons unemployed, but in December, 1924, the figure was reduced to 3686. In Hamilton, where there are 15,870 persons on the register, there were in December, 1921, 4621 persons unemployed. The period of acute depression was much shorter; but conditions have again become much worse, and in December, 1924, the figure of unemployment had risen again to 2452. In Glasgow, where there are 377,190 persons on the register, there were in June, 1922, 85,246 persons unemployed. These figures fell to 64,497 in June, 1924, but in December they rose to 71,838.19. From these figures, it appears that, of the areas selected, Glasgow and Greenock are now considerably the worst. Taking the figures for men only, the proportion in Glasgow is one man in 4ij unemployed. In the Bridgeton district of Glasgow the proportion is as high as 1 in 2f. In Greenock it is 1 in 4. In Paisley and Hamilton it is 1 in 6. In Cambuslang 1 in 8, and in Clydebank 1 in 9.
20. Changes in the standard rates of weekly wages in the shipbuilding trade are illustrated by the following figures, selected from comprehensive lists supplied to us by the shipbuilding establishments in Clydebank.	August, 1914.	June, 1920.	February, 1925.Labourers   -Engineers Plumbers	 14  9  1. 18   3  2   7   3	 3 13   1  4   8   4  4 18   5	 1 19   8  2 16   2  3  2  1Generally, it appears that between August, 1914, and June, 1920, the standard rate of money wages rose from 100 to 200 per cent., the greatest rise being in unskilled labour. Since June, 1920, there has been a heavy fall; but the standard rates still remain from 30 to 60 per cent, higher than they were in August, 1914. To determine the real value of these wages, account must be taken of the cost of living, which, according to the index number of the Ministry of Labour, rose in June, 1920, to 150 per cent., and is still about 80 per cent, above the pre-war standard. The worker is, accordingly, much worse off than he was in 1920, and is not so well off as he was in 1914. It should be added that standard rates do not accurately shew the actual position of the worker. There is a good deal of piecework and overtime in shipyards. On the other hand, there is apt in slack times to be considerable irregularity of employment.General Working of Rent Restriction Acts.21. Notwithstanding&apos; the favourable industrial conditions which prevailed at the time, the Act of 1920 was adversely received, and as a protest against it a general one-day strike was organised in Glasgow. But the agitation did not last long, and, though wages began to fall in 1921, the increased rents were generally paid. In 1922, the successive decisions in Kerr v. Bryde led to a good deal of holding up of rent; and the final decision in November of that year, followed by the amending Act in June, 1923, necessitated a great deal of complicated accounting between landlords and tenants on the one hand, and between landlords and rating authorities on the other. In Glasgow, the question between owners and tenants who had paid invalid increases was settled by the adoption of a working rule to credit the tenants with nine months&apos; rent; and a sum of  76,761 was repaid by the rating-authorities to the owners in respect of the increases which became h-recoverable.22. Partly due to these causes, and partly to the economic conditions, a great increase took place in the number of actions of ejection which came into Court. The difference between 1914 and 1924 is shewn in the following table : 
	*1914.		1924.		Total Cases. New and Continued.	Decrees.	Total Cases. New and Continued.	Decrees.Glasgow  -	600	459	29,663	4510Dumbarton	291	200	1,815	680Paisley	13.1	-   90	1,090	370Greenock -	1510	1342	1,340	558Hamilton -	399	312	2,108	28423. In all the Courts the tenants at first adopted the expedient of stating objections to the validity of the notices of increase, but, except in Dumbarton, these were over-ruled by the Sheriffs-Substitute, and the practice was generally abandoned.   In Scot-land, as compared with England, there has been a remarkable absence of appeals on points of law.     The cases in the Sheriff Court, though nominally actions of ejection, are mainly raised for. the purpose of getting the Sheriff-Substitute to fix by what instalments arrears should be paid.   Accordingly, the number of decrees granted is small relatively to the total number of cases, many of which may remain in Court indefinitely.    In like manner, the number of decrees of ejection is no criterion of the evictions which take place.   In the Hamilton area there were, in 1924, 270 ejection decrees, but only 70 evictions.   In Glasgow, while there were 4510 ejection decrees, there were only 822 evictions.   In the exercise of the discretionary powers conferred upon  them  by the  Restriction  Acts,  the  Sheriffs-Substitute endeavour to fix instalments according to the circumstances and. capacity of the tenant.   The duty is not only delicate, but also, from the large number of cases, an arduous one.   While there was some criticism from representatives of Glasgow tenants, to the effect that too ma^ny cases were disposed of in a day, there was almost unanimous recognition of the sympathetic way in which  the   Sheriffs&apos;   duties   are   generally   discharged.     The evidence  of  the  Sheriffs-Substitute  who  appeared  before us was that they are much assisted by the reasonable attitude of the factors and tenants and their legal representatives, which often renders it unnecessary to give a decision.   In Glasgow, where the volume of cases is very great, much assistance is given by a public-spirited member of the Corporation, who attends every Eent Court and gives information as to the circumstances of the tenants. In the same city a voluntary committee was at one time formed, and did useful work in making arrangements between landlord and tenant without the necessity of going to Court.   But for some* In 1914 a considerable number of rent cases were heard in some of the Burgh Courts and they are not included in the above Table.
reason tenants did not apply to it; and the factors ceased to take cases before it, because, according to their evidence, they found that the obligations undertaken by the tenant were not fulfilled i as they would have been under judicial proceedings. Another very material factor in relieving the situation in Glasgow, and to some extent in other places, has been the raising of a public fund by voluntary sub-scription to assist payment of rent in hard cases. Had it not been for this fund, it is said that there would have been serious trouble in Glasgow. In our opinion, the careful and sympathetic exercise of the discretionary powers entrusted to the Court, with or without the assistance of the various agencies above described, is vital to the administration of the&apos; Rent Acts in times of industrial distress like the present.24. As a result of this system, arrears of rent, though considerable in amount, have been kept within comparatively moderate limits; and arrears of rates are small. In Glasgow, there were no general figures available for arrears of rent; but the experience of a factor with a large amount of working-class property was that the arrears amounted to about one-fifth of the annual rent; and it may be taken as typical. In Cambuslang and Greenock the proportion of arrears to rental is approximately the same. The arrears of rates outstanding at the end of the financial year 1923-24, for that year, are shewn in the following table : 	Parochial.	Municipal.	Water.	County.

Working of Rent Restriction Acts in Clydebank.25. In Clydebank tbe course of events has been very different. The case of Kerr v. Bryde arose there.   It was followed, as might have been, expected, by a general disposition on the part of tenants to withhold payment of.the permitted increase, because the successive decisions were in their favour; and when the remedial Act was passed in June, 1923, matters did not improve. Encouraged by their success, the local Housing Association, represented by an ingenious legal adviser, initiated a policy of contesting the validity of notices of increase on every conceivable ground, and in almost every case their objections were sustained. Many notices had been very carelessly prepared.   In one of the earlier cases the notice omitted the address of the premises to which it related, omitted to state the rent payable at the date thereof, referred the tenant to the &quot;County Court,&quot; and dated the. right to do so from September instead of November.   It con-cluded with the signature of the factor in place of the landlord, whose name and address were not stated, and was held invalid on this ground.   Another notice was held bad because it failed to state the proper address of the Sanitary Authority, and another because, being framed for use in three different areas, it gave the addresses of three authorities, and the printed reference to the two which were not applicable had not been deleted.   In another case the landlord had substituted for the statutory form of notice a form entirely different.   Other mistakes were more excusable. Several notices were held invalid  (though the latest of the decisions was reversed by the Sheriff on appeal) because they were signed by, or stamped with the name of, the factor, instead of being signed by the landlord.    Another was held invalid because the landlord gave notice that he intended to increase the standard rent instead of following the words of the schedule, &quot;rent at present payable by you.&quot;   The attempt to avoid defining &quot;rent at present payable&quot; was not without reason, because there has been much discussion, and it is still apparently regarded as a doubtful point, whether the latter expression, used in a notice subsequent to the repeal of the 1915 and 1919 Acts, did or did not include the increases in respect of rates which the repealed Acts had permitted.   Another case arising from the statutory inclusion of rates in rent was one in which the landlord, assuming that the assessor would alter the entry in the Valuation Roll by the amount of the permitted increase, and that additional occupier&apos;s rates would therefore be imposed, included a notice of increased rates in his notice to the tenant.   Having thereafter become doubtful whether the entry in the Valuation Roll would be altered, he sent a further intimation to the tenant that, in the event of the valuation not being raised, the notice of increase in the rates was cancelled ; and it was held (though an adverse view was expressed on appeal) that the result was to render the whole notice invalid. Another case, which vividly illustrates the difficulty of compliance with the statutory notice, is that in which the landlord had paid a monthly charge for stair gas recoverable from the tenant.   In his notice of increase to the tenant he deducted this amount in order to ascertain the net rent upon which his percentages of increase were based.   It was held that the gas charge, not being
a rate, should not have been deducted, and that the notice was invalid, though the result of the error was to make the increase of rent demanded not greater but less than it should have been. This decision, which applied practically to every notice issued in Glydebank, has also recently been reversed by the Sheriff on appeal, on the ground that the error was not fatal to the validity of the notice. In a later case the landlord, feeling, no doubt, the inequity of including a gas charge in net rent, did not refer to it in the body of the notice of increase, but added a note thereto intimating that the stair gas, amounting to a stated sum per month, fell to be added to the rental above detailed. It was admitted that the notice was invalid, and the Sheriff-Substitute held further that it was not amendable under the Statute.26. In the more recent cases, the efforts of the landlords seem to have been mainly directed to secure amendment of notices under section 6 of the Act of 1923, which allows the correction of errors or omissions due to bona fide mistake on the part of the landlord; but it has been, held in the Dumbarton Court that notices are not amendable (1) if they are not in form statutory notices; and they.are not in form statutory notices unless they appear to state all the essential statutory requirements, or if they contain any additional demand or any qualification or condition not warranted by the statute; and (2) if, the form of the notice being sufficient, the error or omission is due to inadvertence or carelessness. Upon this construction the section has proved to be a very ineffective remedy. In another case, increases have been held invalid because four years after they had been first demanded the tenant denied that he had received a notice, and the landlord was unable to prove that he had given it. . We have given these illustrations of the questions which have been raised, not because we presume to criticize the decisions (the Courts in England have also construed the statutory provisions very strictly), but because, in view of certain recommendations which we shall make below, we think it necessary to indicate the atmosphere of persistent litigiousness which pervades the Court, and the way in which the existing statutory provisions facilitate such tactics. Another feature of the litigation is that only one objection is usually taken at a time, though the notice under consideration might be open to several. This procedure helps to secure that the stream of objections shall not run dry. The general opinion expressed by the witnesses was that it was impossible to frame a notice of increase which would not be. open to criticism. Eor the moment the volume of litigation has declined, because practically, all the notices of increase issued in Clydebank were invalid on the principle of a decision which was only recently reversed on appeal to the Sheriff. But the Housing Association is apparently determined to pursue its policy, and its legal adviser admitted that he had by no means reached the limits of-his ingenuity in finding fresh objections to notices. There is, accordingly, nothing to prevent litigation continuing in the future, as it has done in the past, completely to defeat the operation of the Acts.27. A curious feature in the situation has been the paucity of appeals.   While ordinary actions of ejection are dealt with
summarily, and no appeal is competent, it is always possible, when a question of principle is raised, to secure the right to an appeal first to the Sheriff and then to the Court of Session by getting the case sent to the ordinary roll; but in very few cases, until quite recently, has this been done. Having regard to the campaign of objections with which they were faced, and the increasingly large sum at stake as time passed on, we should have expected tbe factors to adopt a carefully considered policy for testing all important questions which were raised; and we beard no very satisfactory explanation why this was not done. No doubt, during 1924, they were hopeful that some arrangement might be made with the tenants as the result of the negotiations referred to in the next paragraph; but they do not seem to have appreci-ated that one of the main obstacles to such an arrangement was tbe prevailing uncertainty as to the legal position, which a systematic prosecution of appeals might have helped to clear up. In any case, appeals take time; and lapse of time in obtaining decisions as to rent inevitably involves loss, because if working-class rents are not collected timeously, tbe money is apt to be spent on other things.28. As a result of this litigation, the landlords failed to recover increased rents; and it was estimated that on 28th February, 1924, apart from the loss of  47,000 arising from the decision in Kerr v. Bryde, the unrecovered rent amounted to over  100,000. At this stage the Secretary for Scotland intervened, and during the spring and summer of 1924 he had numerous conferences with the parties for the purpose of bringing about a settlement; -but these all proved abortive. In August, 1924, four Labour members of Parliament made a fresh attempt to bring about a settlement, and issued a report containing various suggestions, including the setting up of a tribunal to consider cases of arrears and to exercise discrimination in assessing ability to pay. Such a tribunal was actually formed, and held several meetings with no result. Various witnesses attributed the failure of all these efforts to the attitude of the Housing Association, which insisted on a return to pre-war rents as the basis of any arrangement. There is no doubt that a return to rjre-war rents was, and is, the declared policy of the Association, and that a very active propaganda has been maintained in support thereof. On the other hand, it must be kept in mind that up to that time the tenants had managed to defeat, on legal grounds, almost all the claims for increase of rent which they had contested. One of the chief factors of property in the district&apos; informed us that he had never yet succeeded in establishing a claim to the increased rent which it was the object of the statute to confer upon owners. Legal complications were the main obstacle to the negotiation of a settlement. The point is well stated by Mr. Cormack in a passage in which he was dis-cussing the failure of the negotiations for a settlement in 1924 :  &quot;The arrangement perhaps was that the tenants generally should &quot;accept the position that they would pay the increased rent on &quot;condition that the factors would let off leniently people who were &quot;in real difficulty; and the Housing Association met and &quot;considered the matter, and came to the conclusion that they could &quot;not advise John Smith that he should pay the increased, rent,

In the case of the Parish, the arrears due in May, 1924, has been reduced from  33,885 to  14,245, but the arrears for the current year were  66,776. In the case of the Burgh, the arrears due in May, 1924, had been reduced from  24,975 to  20,020, but the arrears for the current year were  23,539. In the case of the water rates, the arrears due in May, 1924, had been reduced from  9273 to  6883, but the arrears for the current year were  9740. It is difficult to judge during the currency of a financial year what the position will be at the end ;&apos; but the view of the Collectors was that in May, 1925, the position will be considerably worse than it was in May, 1924. The collector of Parish rates informed us that the number of occupiers in arrear was 6476, which represents approximately two-thirds of all the householders in Clydebank.&quot;and Tom Jones, who had an eviction decree against him, would &quot;get off.   It was an impossible position.&quot;29. The most recent figures available with regard to the position of rents in Clydebank are for 28th November, 1924, being i the end of the last complete financial year. In consequence of ; the doubtful validity of the notices of increase, we avoid using the term &quot;arrears.&quot; On 28th November, 1924, the amount of rent uncollected by the factors (including the statutory increase, but excluding the sum lost through the Kerr v. Bryde decision) was  160,017, which represents nearly the full annual value of all the tenanted houses in Clydebank. The latter figure for 1924-25 was  172,335. The corrected figure for rents uncollected at 28th February, 1924, is  109,567. Accordingly, during the nine months from 28th February to 28th November, the amount uncollected increased by  50,550. This sum exceeded by nearly  17,000 the whole of the statutory increase of rent for that period. In other words, there was an extensive failure to pay even pre-war rents. The position is therefore very serious for the owners, . and is rapidly getting worse. The result of investigations made by the Board of Health shews that, of 9700 houses in Clydebank, about 4000 are owned by building and industrial companies and public bodies; and the rest by private persons. Of those held by-private persons, about 2000 are owned in blocks of less than 20 houses.30. The position with regard to the payment of rates is equally disquieting. At the end of the last financial year, on 15th May, 1924, the state of arrears was as follows : 
31. It is unnecessary to point out the unfortunate results of the situation on municipal and parochial administration. Proper budgeting is impossible; current expenditure has to be defrayed from money borrowed from the bank; and the rating authorities are faced with serious difficulties, both legal and accounting.32. The procedure followed with regard to the granting of decrees of ejection at Dumbarton has also been exceptional. In Clydebank, the relations between factors and tenants, accentuated no doubt by the abnormal litigation, are exceptionally bad. There is little in the way of negotiation before cases come into Court, and neither at that time nor after cases are in Court is there any agency or organisation which is prepared to give any help in promoting settlements or aiding the Sheriff-Substitute in exercising discretionary powers. We received a letter from the Secretary of the Housing Association, complaining that ejection proceedings were being taken in two cases of hardship, and instructed our Secretary to inquire, in answer, whether the com-plainer proposed to attend and explain the circumstances to the Sheriff-Substitute. The reply was that it would be futile to do so, and the writer added : &quot;Our agitation has been carried out on &quot;legal points, and whilst we regret that there are cases of genuine &quot;hardship, these do not concern us in our endeavour to insist &quot;that our members are called upon to pay no more than legal &quot;rent.&quot; Some time ago, the Sheriff-Substitute announced that, having regard to the congested state of the Court rolls, he had decided to make some general rules in order to advance the settle-ment of these cases. Among these rules was one that the tenant must undertake to pay all arrears in twelve weekly instalments, and that if, after an adjournment of six weeks, it appeared that the undertaking had not been fulfilled, it would be presumed to-be reasonable that an order for ejection should be made unless the tenant could immediately rebut the presumption. There is no practice in the Court of allowing the presumption to be rebutted by stating circumstances of hardship. When strictly legal contentions fail, decree is simply allowed to pass.33. It will be seen that the system thus followed in the Dumbarton Court differs materially from the system already described (para. 23) followed in other Courts, where a large number of cases is kept on the rolls for an indefinite period, and the circumstances of the cases are repeatedly considered upon applications by the landlords or tenants. We gather that the difference in procedure is really due to a different interpretation of the Statute. In Dumbarton the Sheriff-Substitute&apos;s view, as he explained to us, is that there is no warrant in the Act of Parlia-ment for a judge to interfere between the landlord and tenant where the question is merely one of hardship to the person who is threatened to be evicted. Assuming that this interpretation is correct, or even that there is room for doubt on the point, we think that the Act should be so amended as expressly to secure con-sideration for special cases of hardship. This was the declared object of Lord Salisbury&apos;s Committee in recommending that discretionary powers should be granted (vide para. 8 above), and, as we have already stated (para. 23), it is in our view indispensable
to the smooth working of the Rent Acts. In our opinion, the exercise of such a discretion may be particularly necessary in Clydebank, where the accumulated arrears, if in the end the arrears are held to be legally due, will be exceptionally large in amount. Hitherto, we understand that no decree of ejection has been granted except for arrears of pre-war rent. But. if the permitted increases, are ultimately held to be due, an all-round application of a general rule would inevitably lead to decrees of ejection and evictions on a scale which might result in serious public disorder.34. That this is no idle apprehension is clear from another phase of the rent trouble in Clydebank, viz., the forcible reinstate-ment of tenants in cases of eviction. During most of the year 1924, when negotiations were proceeding with the Scottish Office, a truce was observed, and no evictions took place; but when the negotiations broke down, and decrees of ejection for arrears of pre-war rent began to be enforced, the eviction proceedings were systematically defeated by reinstating the tenants. There was no attempt to deforce the officers who carried out the evictions, and no conflict with the police; but after the furniture had been removed, the inmates ejected, and the house closed up, a crowd assembled, broke open the door, and carried in the furniture, and the tenants moved in again. The crowds did not assemble fortuitously. There is a local organization called the Vigilance Committee. A member thereof, who gave evidence before us, personally disclaimed responsibility for the forcible reinstatement of tenants, but as he explained that the organization exists for the purpose of securing alternative accommodation for evicted tenants, but had never been able to&apos;find any other accommoda-tion than the premises from Which the eviction had taken place, the inference is obvious. The reinstated tenants did not usually remain long. According to figures submitted to us, out of eighteen tenants Who were reinstated, twelve voluntarily left within a comparatively short time. The fact that the reinstatement in most cases was not permanent, and that there was no open collision with officers of the law, deprive these proceedings of the extremely serious significance which might otherwise have attached to them; but the apparent lack of power to enforce the decrees of the civil court was disquieting. The remedy of a complaint under the Trespass Act, which the factors desired, would, if competent, have failed to reach the real offenders who broke open the houses. It is, however, unnecessary to discuss the matter, as the difficulty, such as it was, has been recently solved by criminal proceedings at common law against such offenders. We are not disposed to regard this phase of the rent question as indicative of any general lawlessness in the community, which has been otherwise orderly and well-behaved ; but rather as a special product of the campaign which has been proceeding between landlords and tenants, and of the organisations which have fostered it, coupled with the absence, until recently, of any legal check. On the other hand, the fact that such dis-orders have occurred renders it doubly1 necessary to ensure that cases of ejection are carefully investigated before decrees are granted and executed.
Causes of Difficulties in Clydebank.35. Much difference of opinion existed among the witnesses as to the true cause of the rent difficulties in Clydebank, some attributing them to economic conditions and others to the legal complications above described. In our opinion, the difficulties have been the joint result of both causes. If the tenants had not been pinched by want of employment and the fall in wages, they would probably not have resorted to the policy of contesting claims for rent which brought about legal complications. On the other hand, economic conditions alone would not have brought about the present situation. Economically, Clydebank is now no worse than the other districts from which we heard evidence. Indeed, in some respects it is considerably better. The figures for unemployment are proportionately less than one-half of those in Glasgow and Greenock; and the allowance of relief which married men with families receive from the Parish Council in supplement of the unemployed benefit which they receive from the Unemployment Exchange is higher than the allowance given in any other parish in Scotland, though in many other parishes there are auxiliary agencies for the relief of distress. Most other industrial parishes, including those from which we heard evidence, follow a scale of relief recommended by the Board of Health in 1921; but the Parish of Old Kilpatrick, which includes Clyde-bank, has increased that scale by 18 per cent. Moreover, in Singers&apos; Works, which are situated in Clydebank, the community possesses a double advantage, because these works provide employment for a large number of women as well as for men, and the wages have not fallen in the same degree as they have in the shipbuilding and engineering industries generally. A representa-tive of the company estimated that over 7700 of their employees reside in Clydebank, and--of these over 3000 are women. The medical officer for the burgh says that he sees no evidence of physical deterioration in the community. Its healthy social con-dition is confirmed by the fact that it has recently had the lowest general death-rate and the lowest rate of infant mortality of any burgh in Scotland.36. These indications are all, of course, very general, and in view of strong representations made to us of the general poverty and inability to pay rent, we gladly, availed ourselves of an offer made by Mr. Cunnison, University Lecturer in Economics and Director of the Glasgow School of Social Study and Training, to make an inquiry into the living conditions of a sample, of working-class families in Clydebank. With the assistance of Mr. Makins and a number of trained social investigators, he obtained complete particulars from 258 households, selected by taking every twentieth entry in the Valuation Poll and deleting those which did not relate to obviously working-class houses. For the purpose of compari-son, Mr. Cunnison had available the results of a similar inquiry, made during that winter for purely academic purposes, into living conditions in the Anderston Ward of Glasgow; and as he considered that Anderston differed too much in character from Clydebank to afford an adequate comparison, he extended his
enquiries on this occasion to Port Glasgow, where about 240 households were investigated.We can only give here a few of the leading general results brought out. It was found that in Clydebank the average size of family was 4J persons, consisting of 1.9 wage earners and 2.6 non-wage earners. The average weekly family income, obtained by dividing the aggregate incomes by the number of families, is  3 6s 4d. But a fairer idea of the position is obtained by taking the median income, i.e., the weekly income with an equal number of family earnings above and below it. This figure is  3 Is 6d, and it is the more remarkable when it is borne in mind that 18 per cent, of the wage earners are unemployed. Another important point was the comparatively small number of families whose income was less than the wage of the unskilled labourer. As already pointed out, the standard rate of pay for unskilled labour in the shipyards is 39/8 per week. Of the 252 families investigated, the number whose weekly income was 40/- or under was 37, or only about 14 per cent, of the whole. At the other extremity, the number of families earning over 80/- a week was 80, or nearly one-third of the whole. In these figures no allow-ance is made for holiday periods, extending to about four weeks in each year, when the works are practically closed down. Comparing these results with the results of the inquiry in Anderston and Port Glasgow, it appears that in every respect  the number of wage earners per family, the average family income, and the number of families earning under 40/- per week Clyde-bank is slightly better than Port Glasgow, and substantially better than Anderston.In Clydebank rents ranged from 4/6 to 19/6 per week. The average rent of a one-roomed house was 6/4.9; of a two-roomed house, 8/7, and of a three-roomed house 12/1.5. The median rent, i.e., the weekly rent with an equal number of families above and below it, was 8/10. . This represents 14.3 per cent, of the median income, a percentage which compares favourably with the percentage brought out by similar investigations in England. Bents in Clydebank are much higher than in Anderston, but the properties are not comparable. Compared with Port Glasgow, the rents of one-roomed houses in Clydebank are considerably higher, in the case of two-roomed houses the difference is less, and in the case of three-roomed houses it almost disappears. But Port Glasgow has a considerable area of slum property.Mr. Cunnison&apos;s general, conclusion is, and we agree with it, that in all the areas investigated the standard of family income is low. There is a considerable residuum of households who must find it very hard to pay any rent at all. And even in the case of householders with a higher income, it must be kept in mind that the bulk of the community consists of skilled tradesmen accustomed to a decent standard of life; and in many cases it must be hard for them, consistently with maintaining that standard, to meet their obligations for rent. On the other hand, there is nothing in the present economic conditions of Clydebank, compared with other places, to justify or explain the extraordinary difference which exists between them in the payment of rent and rates.
37. In our opinion, the chief immediate cause of the present position in Clydebank is the persistent litigation which has taken place in the Sheriff Court. The result of it is, as the University investigators found, that few tenants really know what rent is legally due. They know that many notices have been held invalid, and if their case is not covered by a decision already given, it may be covered by the next. It was inevitable that this con-fusion and uncertainty should lead to the holding up of rents. No doubt other causes have contributed, because the situation in Clydebank is much, worse than it is in the rest of the Sheriff Court district of Dumbarton. The tension between factors and tenants is greater; the tenants are better organised; and propagandism has not been without effect. But we do not think that organisa-tion and propagandism would have availed unless they had been recommended by legal success in defeating the operation of the Acts.38. Having regard to the unfortunate past history of the rent question in Clydebank, we are glad to be able to report a disposition on both sides to agree that the present state of matters cannot continue, and that methods of conciliation and compromise should be substituted for the legal campaign which has hitherto been pursued. Mr. M&apos;Elwee, chairman of the Dumbarton and Clydebank Labour Party, who resides in Clydebank, interrogated as to the inexpediency of continuing to fight the landlords in the Law Courts, said : &quot;I agree.   It is futile.   It leads nowhere.. I do not approve of this dog-fighting at all, and if there &quot;is any solution by way of a compromise on the lines you suggest, &quot;I would be quite willing to accept it, but I am just afraid that &quot;the conditions which have created the present situation will, &quot;in turn, create a new similar situation, i.e., inability to pay.&quot; Mr. Cormack, legal adviser to the tenants&apos; association in Clyde-bank, said : &quot;It is a great pity the landlord and tenant should be &quot;fighting. There is no reason why there should not be a well-organised state of affairs.&quot; In the neighbouring burgh of Dumbarton there is much more of tbe spirit of accommodation between landlord and tenant. Councillor Irwin, vice-chairman of the Dumbarton and Clydebank Labour Party, who resides in Dumbarton, asked about the payment of rent in that burgh, said : &quot;There is not a great amount of public trouble, but it has been &quot;largely due to our intervening and trying to keep the peace.&quot; In answer to further questions, he agreed that, through suitable intervention, evictions had been avoided, and that there had not really been serious friction between factor and tenant. He added that he was at present acting on a committee of the Town Council which was doing good work in dealing with cases of distress. Councillor Campbell, seci/etary of the Dumbarton and Clydebank Labour Party, stated that more consideration was given to cases of hardship in Dumbarton than in Clydebank, because the factors and tenants were all. located, in the same town, and he agreed that a committee which would report on the circumstances of each particular case &quot;would tend to get over many difficulties that are &quot;at present in existence.&quot; On the other hand, practically all the representatives of the owners and factors who gave evidence frankly admitted that in times of industrial depression like the
present owners must be prepared to carry a share of the burden, and that extreme measures should not be taken against those who, from unemployment or other causes not attributable to their own fault, found themselves unable to fulfil their obligations for rent. With such a disposition on both sides, we are hopeful that, if the present legal facilities for creating trouble are removed, a working arrangement might be made.Remedies for Situation in Clydebank.39. For this purpose we think that a threefold remedy should be applied, viz. : (1) Endless litigation about the validity of notices issued under the existing regulations should be curtailed by the imposition of a time limit.(2) The existing statutory provisions regarding notices of increase should be amended and the form of notice materially simplified.(3) The duty of considering whether exceptional hardship would be caused to a sitting tenant by granting a decree of eviction should be expressly imposed on the Court, and some special provision should be made for assisting the Sheriff-Substitute in the exercise of his discretionary powers.40. In support of the first of these proposals we need do no more than refer to the narrative of the questions raised in Dumbarton Sheriff Court, contained in paragraphs 25 and 26 above. It seems to us to be neither just nor reasonable that it should be open to parties receiving notices of this kind to lie by for years and then contest their validity on purely technical grounds, with the result of upsetting past payments. Our suggestion is that a short amending Act, applicable to Scotland only, shoiild be passed, and a clause inserted therein providing that a notice of increase served under the existing Acts should be deemed to be valid, and that it should not be competent for the tenant to state any objection to the validity thereof, unless he should have served written notice of such objection upon the landlord or his factor or agent within a certain time from the date of the amending statute. An exception should be made in the case where the objection is that the increase stated in the notice is in excess of the increase permitted by the statutes, but in that case the notice should be invalidated only to the extent of such excess. We suggest that the duration of the time limit should be two months.41. It is possible, though we should deprecate such a result, that the imposition of a time limit might lead to a great many objections being stated and to a renewed outburst of litigation. In that event, we think that judicial assistants should be provided to the Sheriff-Substitute two or three, if necessary- and that the utmost despatch should be insisted on, so as to ensure that the litigation would be disposed of, so far as the Sheriff Court was concerned, within a strictly limited period.-42. With regard to the second proposal, we should explain
that many of the witnesses on both sides, impressed with the defects of the existing legislation, and particularly with the objections referred to in paras. 13 and 14, advocated the repeal of the existing statutes so far as applicable to Scotland, and the enactment for Scotland of a separate statute with the extensive modifications of the existing provisions, including the complete separation of rent from occupiers&apos; rates. We have considerable sympathy with this suggestion, and particularly with the desire to exclude occupiers&apos; rates from the Rent Acts. It is significant that the only owners in Glydebank, who were able to state that their notices were valid, were the Dalmuir Estate Company, whose houses are all above the limit of the House Eetting Acts, and whose notices were therefore free of rating complications. But in our opinion a proposal so drastic is entirely outside our remit. Besides, whatever be the theoretical objections to the legislation, it has been found workable every-where except in Dumbarton, and any attempt to recast it would probably produce a fresh crop of difficulties.43. In any case, we think that a sufficiently effective remedy might be secured by provisions in the proposed amending Act to the following effect : (1) A simplified form of notice of increase such as we have suggested in the Appendix to this report should be substituted for the present form in Schedule A of the Act of 1920.(2) Section 3 of the Act of 1920 should be amended by adding sub-sections providing (a) That a notice of increase served on the tenant afterthe&apos;date of the amending Act should be deemed to to be valid, and no objection to the validity thereof should be competent to the tenant, unless he should have served written notice of such objection upon the landlord or his factor or agent, within three months after service of the notice of increase. An exception should be made in the case where the objection is that the increase stated in the notice is in excess of the increase permitted by the statutes, but in that case the notice should only be invalidated to the extent of such excess. /(b) That service of notice may he effected by registeredletter, and that the fact of such notice being given should not be open to question after three successive payments of the increased amount entered in the rent book.(c) That upon written application by the tenant, the landlord shall be bound under a penalty to supply him with full particulars of how the whole increased rent demanded is made up under Section 2 of the Act of 1920.44. With regard to the form of notice, we do not think it is necessary to argue the case for its simplification. We are simply repeating what Lord Onslow&apos;s Committee recommended in 1923.
The recommendation was unfortunately disregarded in the amending Act of that year. But in view of the chaos which the statutory form has created in Clydebank, its amendment becomes a clear necessity. Presumably it was designed to enable the tenant to check the amount of the proposed increase; but that object can quite well be secured, as Lord OnslowV Committee pointed out, and as we now suggest, by imposing on the landlord an obligation to state how the rent is made up when required to do so by the tenant. In point of fact, the evidence before us clearly shewed that the tenant does not rely on the notice. What he relies upon is his rent book. The witnesses before us were unanimously of opinion that the form of the rent book should be regulated; and if this is done as we shall suggest later on, the tenant will be more than compensated for any protection which he may lose through the abolition of a complicated increase of rent notice.45. It will be observed that the form of notice, which we suggest, not only omits the detailed calculations required by the existing form, shewing how the increase is made up, but differs in another important particular from the existing form. The latter requires the landlord to state, first, the rent &quot;at present &quot;payable,&quot; and then to specify the increase intended to be made thereon. But in Clydebank the landlords do not in many cases know what is the rent &quot;at present payable&quot; in the sense of being legally due. Accordingly, if the new form adhered to the old form in this respect, notices issued thereunder would be liable to all the old exceptions. They would be objected to on the ground that the rent stated as that &quot;at present payable&quot; was not so payable, because the notices under the old Act and the Schedule were invalid. This is not a fanciful contingency. It has already occurred at Dumbarton, where new notices issued for the purpose of correcting mistakes in previous notices held to be invalid, have, in turn, been held invalid. We propose, therefore, to substitute the words, &quot;rent at present being demanded,&quot; for the words, &quot;rent at present payable,&quot; and to state what the rent to be demanded in future will be, and how much of it will consist of occupiers&apos; rates. If the tenant receives notice of these particulars, and is further entitled to obtain on demand further particulars shewing how the whole increased rent is made up, we do not think that he can complain. In Glasgow, the Assessors Department undertakes the duty of assisting tenants to check the amounts stated in notices of increase. We think that other Town Councils might follow this example by imposing this duty on one of their officials : but this does not appear to be a matter for legislation.46. With regard to the third proposal concerning the procedure in cases of ejection, we have already stated that in other Courts the practice is to give consideration to circumstances of exceptional hardship; but the Sheriff-Substitute at Dumbarton holds that the existing statutes confer no power to do so. In our opinion, the matter is much too important to be left in doubt. We think that it might, and should, be made clear by introducing after the words, &quot;the Court considers it reasonable to make such
&quot;an order or give-such judgment,&quot; in section 4 of the Restriction Act of 1923, a provision similar to that in section 12, (1) in some such terms as follows : &quot;In exercising such discretion, the Court &quot;may take into consideration that the proceedings appear to be &quot;harsh or oppressive, or that exceptional hardship would be caused &quot;to the sitting tenant by the making or giving of such an order &quot;or judgment.&quot;47. There is another point which, though technical, is of some importance. The statutory provisions conferring discretionary powers on the Court expressly authorise it to stay or suspend execution of an order for possession or ejectment after it is granted, and likewise to discharge such order. The proceedings in an ordinary action nf ejection are summary, and the orders of the Court are all filled into a printed form, which, when the last order is signed, is taken away by the landlord or his agent as his warrant for execution. There is then no paper or proceeding before the Court in which an order for suspension or discharge of the previous judgment can be pronounced. The Sheriffs-Substitute in Glasgow and other places have got over the difficulty in a, practical way by making the applicant for suspension lodge a minute, on which they write an order requiring the previous judgment to be returned to the Court, and then granting or refusing suspension as the case may be. But the Sheriff-Substitute at Dumbarton considers that when a decree of ejection has left his hands he has no power to do anything further. The difficulty might be met by the Lord President of the Court of Session framing an Act of Sederunt prescribing the necessary procedure for giving effect to the statutory provision. This course was followed to meet a previous difficulty in the Dumbarton Court with regard to the amendment of notices of increase.48. A much more important point is the provision of some means whereby the circumstances of individual cases may be investigated and considered, arrangements between landlord and tenant brought about, and, if that fails, the necessary information laid before the Court. For this purpose we suggest the formation of a committee of three members, one representing the factors&apos;, and another the tenants&apos;, interest, with a neutral chairman. We think it would greatly conduce to the successful working of such a committee if it were assisted, at any rate during the earlier meetings, by representatives of the landlords&apos; and tenants&apos; interests from Glasgow, who are familiar with the methods of conciliation adopted there.49. We see no necessity for any statutory provision for such a committee. Statutory powers would rather be an embarrass-ment by creating difficulties as to the respective functions of the committee and the Sheriff-Substitute. As a purely voluntary body, it would create no such difficulty; it would act as an intermediary between landlord and tenant in so far as either of them chose to appeal to it; and it would be of great assistance to the Sheriff-Substitute in determining ability to pay, in fixing instalments of arrears, and. otherwise in the exercise of his discretionary powers. The Sheriff-Substitute, stated that if such a body were formed he would be glad to have its assistance.   We
regard the establishment of such a body as a matter of first importance in bringing about better relations between landlord and tenant in Clydebank; but we must again point out that, until the legal uncertainty of the position is cleared up, it will be difficult for the committee to function properly.50. It has also been suggested that it would materially promote the objects above indicated if Rent Courts were held at Clydebank instead of Dumbarton. It would certainly be easier for tenants to attend and give explanations at Clydebank; and it appears that they do not at present do so at Dumbarton. On the other hand, it appears that no use is made of certain facilities which now exist for the purpose. In 1923, on the application of the Town Council, the Scottish Office made an order for holding a Small Debt Court at Clydebank once a month, but since that date only one aioplication was made for a case to be taken there; and it was withdrawn before the Court sat. If the committee which we have suggested found that it was desirable to take advantage of these facilities, they could do much to bring it about.Other Remedies Rent Books and Inspection.51. In addition to the above proposals, which arise mainly out of the situation in Clydebank, we desire to make other two suggestions, which, in our opinion, if carried into effect, would materially relieve the difficulties of the rent problem, both in Clydebank and in other areas. The first is the adoption by Parish Councils of the system of examining the rent books of persons in receipt of relief. Belief is supposed to be fixed at a scale which will suffice to cover rent, and as the payment of parish rates imposed on occupiers depends, in the case of small houses, on the payment of rent, Parish Councils have a direct interest to see that rent is paid. For this reason, Boards of Guardians in England generally insist on rent books being exhibited when relief is given. In Scotland the system has only been adopted in a few parishes; but one of them is Cardross, which almost immediately adjoins Old Kilpatrick. The, Chairman and Clerk of the Parish Council both gave evidence before us, and explained that the system was first adopted there in 1923. An explanatory circular issued by the Parish Council at the time puts the matter very clearly : &quot; A portion &quot;of the assistance paid week by week by the Parish Council^ &apos; intended to go towards house rent; each person, while in receipt &quot;of such relief, must, as a condition thereto, pay to the landlord &quot;the current weekly rent. In order to know if this is being done, &quot;the Inspector of Poor is authorised to inspect all rent books, and &quot;to ask that these be produced at the pay table. The Parish &quot;Council consider that this procedure will work to the benefit of &quot;all concerned. The recipient of relief will insure that his home &quot;is being kept for him. The landlord will be getting the rent to &quot;which he is justly entitled, and the other ratepayers in the parish &quot;who are paying their own rent and rates will not be called upon &quot;to pay  any part of that which should have been paid by another.&quot; If the rent book is not exhibited, the amount of the rent is retained by the Inspector from the relief paid. We were informed that at first there was some opposition to this order, a number of rent books were not exhibited, and considerable sums were retained.
sBut within a few weeks the production of rent books became general, and the system has since worked quite smoothly. The result is that in Cardross, which is industrially of precisely the same character as Old Kilpatrick, there are practically no arrears of parish rates.52. During 1924 several conferences on this subject were held between the Secretary for Scotland, the Under Secretary for Health, and the chairmen of the Parish Councils in the principal industrial areas. At these conferences a large majority of the chairmen expressed their readiness to adopt the system of inspection, but refused to go the length of paying the rent to the landlords, as they were then pressed to do. It appears to us, that if the system of inspection were adopted, it would go a very long way to solve the rent difficulty. It would automatically remove all such cases from the Ejection Court, because the factors concede that an unemployed man should not be ejected for failure to pay arrears; and it would thus reduce the volume of cases in Court to much more manageable dimensions. We would strongly recom-mend that a renewed conference be held for the purpose of securing the general adoption of this system. One difficulty which emerged last year, and would no doubt emerge again, is whether the scale of relief, though it may include an allowance for rent, is sufficient to cover the much greater amounts now required from tenants in consequence of permitted increase of rents and rise in rates. In a circular issued to Parish Councils by the Board of Health, dated 21st March, 1924, the Board suggested that, where an applicant for relief could prove that he was paying more than 5/- or 6/- per week for rent, the Parish Council should consider the granting of an additional amount of relief for rent, the allow-ance for rent not to exceed 10/- per week in all.53. Tbe other general suggestion which we desire to make is the prescribing of a standard form of rent book for monthly and weekly tenants. At present there is no standard form, though the factors&apos; association in Glasgow have framed a form, which they recommend their members to adopt. In most cases the books provided to their tenants by the factors are clear and well kept, but there are undoubtedly many exceptions. Many specimens were exhibited to us in the course of the inquiry, which were quite unintelligible. In some, cases there, was no printed form, and the only entries consisted of a series of irregular entries of sums received/ In other cases, though there was a printed form, it was impossible to discover how much the tenant was in arrear. In other cases, the entries of payments of current rent were mixed up with special payments, such as instalments due under the Act of June, 1923, for the arrears of increases validated by that Act. It is obviously of great importance to the tenant to know exactly what his rent is, and, if he has fallen into arrear, exactly how he stands. For this he trusts to his rent book. Occasional notices, such as those prescribed by the Pent Acts, are apt to be laid aside and lost; and, in any case, they do not shew the actual position. For these reasons, the rent book ought to be clearly kept; and we a.re satisfied that the only way to ensure its being clearly kept is to insist on a standard form of book.
i 54. We, accordingly, recommend the insertion of provisions in the proposed amending Act that the owner or the factor of every dwelling house, the rent of which is payable by the month or week, shall, on the appointed day, or, in the case of a let subsequent to the appointed day, at. the time of the let, deliver to the tenant a rent book in the prescribed form, or in a form substantially similar thereto; that all payments of rent made thereafter shall be duly entered therein; and that it shall be a good defence, either to an action for rent or to an action for possession or ejectment, (1) that the standard form of book has not been provided to the tenant, or (2) that, on the tenant producing the book, it appears to the Court that the entries therein have not been made by the landlord or his agent with reasonable care and clearness. It should also be pro-vided that the books should not cover a period of more than two years&apos; payments, and we suggest as the appointed date for their coming into operation 28th November, 1925.55. The forms which we suggest are appended to this report. In general explanation of the forms, we should point out that, while the financial year of the rating authorities runs from Whitsunday to Whitsunday, the actual rates, and the Valuation Roll entries, upon which they are assessed, are not fixed till autumn. Accordingly, the universal practice is for the landlord to begin recovering the new occupier&apos;s rates from his tenant in the month of December, and these rates continue to be recovered monthly or weekly, as the case may be, and the practice is to adjust any alteration, in rates in the payment of rent for the month of November, and to begin recovering the new rates in December. In order to regulate the recovery of current rent and rates, each page of the book will contain entries for six months, beginning in December and June, respectively, spaces being always available for weekly j)ayment, which are often made by monthly tenants. Each page will be headed with a statement of the monthly or weekly rent and rates, and the monthly or weekly total. When payment is made of a sum more than sufficient to meet the rent -and rates due for a fixed period of payment, monthly or weekly, or the balance thereof, such first mentioned payment should be divided by the owner or factor, the amount necessary to clear the rent book for such fixed period of payment should be so applied and entered in the book, while the balance should be applied towards payment of the rent and rates for the immediately succeeding fixed period of payment, and should be so enter-edin the book.The entry of arrears presents some difficulty. In order to avoid confusion, and to enable the new rent books to be properly started, we think that it would be desirable to treat any arrears existing at the appointed date as funded, and to enter the amount and the instalments paid to account thereof in a separate page of the book, or a separate memorandum to be delivered to the tenant and retained along with the book. The same rule should apply to the increases between December, 1922, and June, 1923, which were validated by the Act of June, 1923, and are, in terms thereof, payable by instalments amounting to 15 per cent, of the standard rent. In cases where a tenant falls into arrear after the appointed date, but is still endeavouring to pay up in full without
distinguishing between current rent and arrears, the ordinary form will suffice, the difference between the dates of the payments and the month&apos;s or week&apos;s rent paid shewing at a glance how much the tenant is in arrear. But when, either by arrangement or under an instalment decree pronounced by the Sheriff, an instal-ment of arrears is paid along with current rent, the above method should be followed of treating the arrears as funded.In our opinion, the recommendations above mentioned with regard to the particular method of entering payments, otherwise than the funding of arrears, should not be made statutory rules, but should be embodied in the form of &quot;Notes for the guidance of owners and factors,&quot; to be printed in the standard book. It is. enough in the way of statutory requirement that books in standard form should be kept and payments entered therein to the satisfac-tion of the Court. Anything further would repeat what we humbly consider to be the defects of the existing Acts by providing facilities for technical objections.In the case of weekly rents, there is a practice which is universally adopted in Glasgow and Dundee, and it may be else-where, to exact payment of rent during forty-eight weeks only in the year, leaving a fortnight during the summer holidays and a fortnight at New Year when no rent is payable. We are told that this arrangement is much appreciated by tenants in places where it prevails. On the other hand, it is one which could scarcely be made compulsory. The form of rent book contains a space the top in which the figure of 48 or 52 should be entered accordingly.Position of Arrears in Clydebank.56. The unrecovered rents in Clydebank present a difficult problem, both from the point of view of landlord and tenant and from that of the rating authorities. The primary difficulty is that the amount of the legal arrears of rent is quite unascertained. At the beginning of the inquiry we were told that all increases were invalid, under one decision or another. Since then, a judgment which applied to most of the notices has been reversed on appeal. But whether the result of it has been to validate all the notices, or whether they may be open to other objections, we do not know. The legal position of the rating authorities also appears to be uncertain. The Provost explained to us that he had been advised that even if in the end all the increases are held invalid, the rating authority could hold the landlord responsible for occupiers&apos; rates, and that the Town Council intended to try the question. Apart from these purely legal difficulties, the retrospective effect of the decisions as to notices has created serious accounting complications. The Provost explained that hitherto the collector had perforce to accept the factors&apos; statements, but he indicated that it might be necessary to investigate the state of the rent books. This would involve enormous trouble and expense, and would probably result in further litigation.57. Our opinion is that if, by the adoption of the suggestions which we have made above, regular payment of rents and rates could be secured from this time forward, both the landlord and the rating authorities would be well advised to make up their minds to
pocket, at any rate, a considerable part of their loss, and to abstain as far as possible from protracting a state of litigation which has. already proved so ruinous. In the first place, the arrears, if they are held to be legally due, have accumulated so long and are now so large that it is certain a considerable portion of them cannot now be recovered. In the second place and this is much the more important point the main interest of every one now is that normal conditions should return as early as possible; and if the rating authorities continue to press for payment of arrears of rates, and the landlords continue to press for payment of all arrears of rent, the return to normal conditions will be rendered difficult, if not impossible.58. In expressing this view, we do not mean that all claims for arrears of rents and rates should be given up; but we suggest that the general policy, both of the landlords and the rating authorities, should, in their own interests, rather be directed to secure fulfilment of future obligations, than to imperil them by endeavouring to secure the payment of past debts which are largely irrecoverable. There will, no doubt, be cases where rent has been unjustifiably withheld by tenants who have still the means to pay. In judging such cases, and, indeed, on the whole question of how far arrears should be enforced in addition to the payment of current rent, we think that the investigations and advice of the committee which we have suggested should be of material assistance.General Suggestions by Landlords.59. We pass to the consideration of some more general suggestions put forward for the better working of the Rent Acts. The chief suggestions made on behalf of the landlords were : (1) the abolition of the existing restriction on the landlords right to increase rent by the full amount of any increase on owner&apos;s rates, and(2) increased facilities for decontrol.60. In theory it is impossible to justify the restriction created by section 18 (b) of the Act of 1920 on the landlords right to include in rent the.full amount of his rates. There is no apparent reason for drawing a distinction between a rise in rates prior to 1919-20 and a rise in rates thereafter. It creates an inequality  or, rather, it accentuates the inequality between the position of the Scottish owner who pays rates and the English owner who pays none. In England the owner gets the full benefit of the 40 per cent, increase on the net rent in 1914 allowed by the statute. In Scotland the owner has not only to bear his own rates on the increase itself, he has also to bear any rise after 1919-20 in owner&apos;s rates on the 1914 net rent. The restriction creates a still less defensible inequality among Scottish owners according to whether in any particular rating area rates have risen or remained stationary since 1919-20. The result is that, out of the 40 per cent, increase which the Act nominally allows him, the landlord in Clydebank, after deducting his own rates, gets rather less than 20 per cent., the landlord in Glasgow gets 24-J per cent., the landlord in Edinburgh gets 32 per cent., while the landlord in
Aberdeen gets 35 per cent. As we have already pointed out, Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee in 1918, and Lord Onslow&apos;s Committee in 1923, recommended the removal of this ground of inequality. A further result of it is that in places like Clydebank, where there has been a material rise in the rates, notwithstanding the per-mitted increase of rent, the landlord who properly fulfils his obligation to keep the property in repair will receive considerably less return on his capital now than he was receiving in 1914. Statements were submitted to us shewing that in the case of bonded property in Clydebank the return is reduced by one-half. In consequence, there is in all cases a temptation, and in some cases probably a necessity, to keep down outlay on repairs. We shall revert to this point in dealing with the tenants&apos; complaints about disrepair.61. The general failure to recover rents in Clydebank rendered it impossible to test the actual return which the permitted increase would allow on capital invested in working-class property there; and in a less degree the same observation applies to property in other areas. Some instructive statements were, however, submitted to us by Mr. Harper, shewing the results of the administration of four blocks of property in Greenock from 1914-15 down to 1923-24. In one block, which consisted of better-class property, the average net return since 1919-20 has been better than in the previous period, and has represented 3 per cent, as compared with 2 per cent, on the cost of the property. In the other blocks, which consisted of working-class property, the average net return since 1919-20 has been about the same as it was in the previous period, and has represented from 3J to 4 per cent, on the prices of the properties. Other statements submitted to us by Mr. Faulds, relating to properties in Glasgow, compared with similar statements relating to the same properties which he submitted to a Departmental Committee in 1915, shew that since 1915 the returns on the properties have, for the most part, substantially improved, and now yield from 3J to 6f per cent, on the sums invested. It is also to be kept in mind that in 1914 there was a considerable number of unlet houses which are all now occupied, and that the owners of working-class property, while they have been hampered by the statutory restrictions, have not suffered from the same serious depreciation which has taken place in large residential properties. For these reasons, while we agree that they have a legitimate grievance, we do not think it is so urgent as to call for an immediate remedy, which would impose a further burden on the tenants at so inappropriate a period of industrial depression as the present.62. In our opinion, the subject of decontrol and suggestions for wider statutory facilities for bringing it about, obviously raise a question of general policy which it is beyond our functions to discuss. -General Suggestions by Tenants.63. The thesis of a great deal of the evidence laid before us on behalf of the tenants was that on account of low wages and unemployment they are unable to pay the increased rent permitted by the Restriction Acts.   In support of this proposition
various estimates were submitted of the minimum subsistence allowance for a family of four, which ranged about the figure of  i per week. There is a startling discrepancy between this figure and the figure of 29/6 which is allowed by Parish Councils for a family of that size, according to the generally accepted scale of. relief for able-bodied poor; but we do not feel called upon to criticise or discuss the estimates. So far as the present inquiry is concerned they lead nowhere, except to the conclusion that two-thirds of the community cannot pay any rent at all. And many of the witnesses frankly admitted that they had no desire to penalise a particular section of property owners, and that even the total elimination of rent would not serve their purpose.64. We are much more impressed by the statistics referred to in previous paragraphs regarding unemployment, the fall in wages, the number of ejection cases in the Courts, etc. All these go to confirm the evidence of many witnesses that, while the rent problem has not in other places assumed the public prominence which it has in Clydebank, the payment of rent involves pressure and difficulty, and in many cases hardship, throughout the industrial areas in the West of Scotland. In all the areas selected the economic position is aggravated by overcrowding. In Clyde-bank the percentage of the population in one-roomed houses is 10.7, in Hamilton it is 25, in Greenock 10.5, in Paisley 12.3, and in Glasgow 12.8. In all the areas, except Clydebank, there is a large amount of insanitary property which should, but cannot, be closed, in consequence of the scarcity of houses. The over-crowding may, and does, help to pay rent; but, apart from its effect on the health and morals of the population, it accentuates discontent with the situation.65. Most of the remedies suggested by the witnesses the establishment of a minimum wage, the recasting of the system of rating, the restoration of pre-war rents, and the granting of a State subsidy to areas specially suffering from unemployment  it is obviously beyond our province to discuss. Most of those who advocated the popular policy of a return to pre-war rent had not apparently considered the class of houses to which it should apply. On the other hand, in addition to the complaint about rent books, with which we have already dealt, various grievances were put forward which merit attention.66. The main grievance was the failure of the landlords to keep proxDerties in proper repair. If there were any general disregard by the landlords of their obligations in this respect, it could not be attributed to want of statutory provisions for com-pelling them to do so. Both the Housing Code and the Rent Restriction Acts give every facility for the purpose, and, at any rate, in Glasgow and Clydebank, the tenants are not slow to avail, themselves of these facilities. In Glasgow there is a small army of inspectors whose sole duty it is to detect deficiencies and enforce compliance with the obligations to keep houses in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. In 1924, 1850 statutory notices were issued, affecting over 2421 houses. Not-withstanding these protections, there was a large body of evidence  from  representatives  of the tenants that landlords
35916generally were wholly failing to - discharge their duty, and equally emphatic evidence from factors to the contrary. For example, Mr. Faulds, a representative factor, who has under his charge about 4000 houses in Glasgow subject to the Eent Restriction Acts, informed us that the actual amounts paid to tradesmen for repairs on the properties was in 1914  6615, and in 1922  15,228. A more comprehensive statement, made up by a number of members of the Property Owners&apos; and Factors&apos; Association in Glasgow, shews that the outlay on their properties, which in 1914 amounted to  366,712, rose in 1922 to  538,628. Mr. Harper&apos;s statements, relating to properties in Greenock, to which we have already referred, shew that in some blocks the average cost of rej^airs since 1920-21 has nearly doubled the previous average; in other blocks it has remained about the same.67. It would be impossible to settle this controversy definitely without much more detailed investigation than we should have been warranted in undertaking. The evidence on one side did not meet the evidence on the other as it Would have done in trying an issue in a Court of Law. At the same time, we think it is clear how part of the contradiction arises. The factors admit that decorative work, such as papering and painting, which used to be necessary in order to attract tenants, is no longer necessary for that purpose, and is, accordingly, no longer done. Their main outlays are in external repairs roof, gables, chimneys, etc.&apos; and drains. These the tenant probably does not notice, while he does notice, and resents the absence of, any internal decoration. The tenants&apos; allegation that practically no repairs are clone at all we cannot accept. Without repairs the property would rapidly deteriorate, and the sanitary authority would intervene. There are, of course, diiferent degrees of repair in which a property may be maintained; and we have little doubt that in many cases the cost of repairs is being kept down for two reasons : In the first place, because the full rent is not being received. We need not repeat the figures which we have already given as to the state of arrears. In the second place, even if the full increased rent were being received, the landlord is not, for the reasons pointed out in paragraph 59, getting the full benefit of it. In Clydebank, for instance, the landlord who gets an increase of 40 per cent, has, after paying his rates, only 20 per cent, left, and if his property is mortgaged, 10 per cent, of that goes to the bondholder, leaving him with 10 per cent. The suggestion that in these circumstances he should expend 25 per cent, on repairs seems to us to be extravagant. If the Scottish owner received, like the English owner, his 40 per cent, clear, we think that the tenant would have a well-founded complaint if the 25 per cent, contemplated, by the statute were not spent on repairs, and a good case for demanding that the increase allowed for repairs should be reduced. But, out of regard to the present condition of tenants, we have been unable to recommend any remedy for the landlord in that respect (para. 61); and it follows that we cannot recommend any remedy for the tenant by way of reduction of the amount allowed for repairs.68. Another complaint by the tenants&apos; representatives was that, notwithstanding the prohibition imposed by the Act of 1920
against the payment of any premium for the grant of a tenancy, if was still a common practice for landlords to exact &quot;key money.&quot; As the statute already imposes a very heavy penalty for breach of the prohibition against both the person requiring and the person making such a payment, we do not see what further remedy can be applied. The Glasgow Factors&apos; Association strongly condemn the practice, and their representatives stated that they would strictly investigate any suspected case which was reported to them.69. Another complaint was that in the Ejection Court in Glasgow an attempt is made to dispose of a long roll of cases in too short a time, with the result that individual cases do not always receive sufficient consideration. It was also suggested that rent cases should be allocated to a special tribunal, consisting of a representative from each side, with a Sheriff as Chairman. It is to be noted that neither of these points was referred to by Councillor Buchan, the member of the Corporation who attends Ejection Courts in the interest of., the tenants, and to whose evidence for that reason we attach particular importance. He says that the average number of cases enrolled for each Court day is about 300, consisting of about 200 continued and 100 new cases. These are disposed of in about two and a half hours; but it is not necessary for the Sheriff to intervene in every case, because voluntary settlements are often made. Asked whether the Sheriff gave personal attention to each case, his answer was, &quot; In the Ejection Court he does,,&quot; and he added, &quot; I want to say this, in justice to the Sheriffs, that the Sheriffs in the Sheriff Court in Glasgow are very reasonable with the tenants.&quot; Councillor Buchan has a knowledge of the working of the Ejection Court, which no other member of the public can pretend to, and his evidence shews that the haste complained of is more apparent than real.70. Claims for payment of rent, as distinct from actions of ejection, are disposed of in the Small Debt Court, and the complaint is that there, if the debt is admitted, the tenant, or rather his wife, who usually appears, is left too much in the hands of the factor, and that the power conferred by the Act of 1924 to allow the tenant to pay by instalments is not exercised as freely as it might be, and is exercised in the Ejection Court. Councillor Buchan does not usually attend the Small Debt Court; but on a recent occasion he did so, and the Sheriff granted his request that certain tenants should be allowed to pay by instalments. It would rather appear that there is a want in the Small Debt Court of some person who will undertake the duty which he discharges in the Ejection Court, and. that the interests of tenants may sometimes suffer on that account. The volume of cases to be disposed of is so great that it must be very difficult to investigate the circumstances of each of. them without some special assistance of that kind; but attention having been called to the matter, we feel sure that the Sheriffs will take it into consideration.71. The suggestion, of a Bents Tribunal put forward by Mr. Shaw, of the Glasgow Trades and Labour Council, formed part
sof a larger scheme, under which the rent, or proportion of rent, which the Tribunal might determine that the tenant was unable to pay, would be payable by the Parish Council out of State provided funds. While primarily applicable to the unemployed, it would also apply to the low paid wage earner. In substance, the scheme thus involves the financing by the State of all rents which tenants are held to be unable to pay, and it is, in our opinion, beyond our province to discuss.72. On the other hand we think that the experience of Glasgow demonstrates the utility of a voluntary representative, who will attend Kent Courts in the tenants&apos; interest, and appear for those who are not represented by a qualified law agent, not for the purpose of arguing legal points, but for the purpose of stating the tenants&apos; circumstances when the exercise of discretionary powers is involved. We have no doubt that the Sheriffs generally would welcome the assistance of such a representative, and in most places where the number of cases is large, some one should be found able and willing to undertake this useful form of public service.SUMMARY.73. We may now summarise our general conclusions and recommendations.(1) So far as we have been able to ascertain, difficulties in carrying out the pi*provisions of the Rent Restrietion Acts have been mainly confined to Glasgow and tbe industrial areas in the West of Scotland.(2) In these areas the chief difficulty has been the severe and prolonged industrial depression, accompanied by a heavy rise in local rates, which lias made it difficult for many tenants to pay increased rents and rates, and has led to a large increase in the number of actions for rent and for ejection in the Sheriff Courts.(3) Legal questions arising out of the interpretation of the Acts, or the validity of the notices of increase of rent, have not generally created much difficulty, except the decision of the House of Lords in Kerr v. Bryde, and the special legislation following thereon, which necessitated a great deal of complicated readjustment between landlords and tenants, and also between landlords and rating authorities.(4) In reconciling the legal claims of landlords with the claims of tenants to equitable treatment, on the ground of unemployment, etc., we regard the discretionary powers statutorily conferred upon the Sheriff as important and indeed vital to the fair administration of the Rent Acts, during periods of industrial distress; and these powers have generally been carefully and sympathetically exercised.(5) The result is that payment of increased rents has been made subject to a moderate amount of arrears, and the loss incurred by rating authorities, in consequence of failure to pay rent, has been comparatively smalh
(6) If Parish Councils generally adopted the practice, followed in England, and in at least one industrial parish in Scotland, of inspecting rent books when paying relief, it would, in our opinion, secure still better results, and would at the same time substantially relieve the -   congestion of rent cases in the Courts.(7) We find that many tenants suffer inconvenience from badly kept rent books; and in our opinion the importance of these books to tenants is such as to warrant the require-ment of a standard form of book.(8) We received many complaints that landlords are not fulfilling their obligation to keep houses in repair, and in particular that they are not spending on repairs the percentage of increase allowed for that purpose. We are not satisfied that the general complaint is sufficiently proved. On the other hand, we have little doubt that the full statutory percentage is not being expended, because it is subject to payment of owners&apos; rates. In our opinion, the reduction of the permitted increase could not be considered without at the same time considering the removal of the inequality between Scottish and English owners in the matter of owners&apos; rates; and in the interests of the tenants we do not think that a period of industrial depression is appropriate for making such a change.(9) In Clydebank, to which the following paragraphs relate, we find the position to be wholly exceptional. The increases of rent permitted by the statutes have generally proved to be irrecoverable by legal process. The amount of rents unrecovered is nearly equal to a whole year&apos;s rental of the tenanted houses in the burgh ; and the arrears of rates are extensive, and are causing serious embarrassment to the rating authorities.(10) In our opinion, this state of matters, though not unconnected with economic conditions, is not immediately due to them. Though the community has suffered heavily from the prevailing industrial depression, it is no worse off now, and indeed, in some respects, is materially better off than some of the adjoining areas.(11) The chief immediate cause.of the non-payment of rent has been, the successful conduct by the tenants of a legal campaign against the validity of notices of increase issued by the landlords under the statutes. Other suggested causes, such as propagandism by tenants&apos; organizations, have probably contributed; but their influence has been largely due to the success of the legal campaign.(12) The complexity of the statutes and the detailed require-ments of the existing statutory form of notice of increase lend themselves to technical objections, and upon^ the principles of construction hitherto applied to the validity of such notices, the process may go on indefinitely.(13) The power of amending defective notices conferred on the Court by the Act of 1923 has proved ineffective,
39S18(14) The decisions invalidating so many notices have produced a general feeling of uncertainty as to the legal position among tenants and owners; and until this is removed we do not think that material improvement in the situation can be expected.(15) The only effectual solution appears to us to be legislation to simplify the form of notice, and to impose a limit on the time within which technical objections can be taken either to past or future notices.(16) The state of public feeling which the rent campaign has brought about, and the existence of large arrears of rent, render it expedient that the discretionary powers con-ferred on the Court by the statutes should be fully and carefully exercised.(17) For this purpose it is necessary that certain doubts with regard to the exercise of these powers should be removed, and it would be desirable that the assistance of a voluntary committee should be secured.74. We accordingly recommend that-(1) A short amending statute should be passed applicable to Scotland only.(2) The statutory form of notice of increase of rent should be materially simplified.(3) The landlord should be required to provide on separate application by the tenant the particulars now required in the notice, and Town Councils should impose on an appropriate official the duty of assisting tenants to check the calculation of increased rents and rates.(4) Time limits should be imposed on the statement of objections to the validity of notices of increase past and ; future&quot;.(5) It should be made clear that in exercising discretionary powers under the Statute, the Court should take into consideration circumstances involving exceptional hard-ship to the tenant.(6) Procedure should be prescribed for enabling the Court to suspend or discharge decrees for possession or ejection.(7) A standard form of rent book should be prescribed for monthly and weekly tenants.(8) Parish Councils should be urged to adopt the practice of inspecting rent books.(9) A Committee should be formed in Clydebank to act as intermediaries between landlord and tenant, and to assist the Court by furnishing particulars in cases of ejection.75.

The main cause of. the rent troubles in the Clyde and West of Scotland area is poverty and distress arising from unemployment and low wages. The simple fact revealed by the Inquiry is that the wages of the great number of. Clyde workers are inadequate for household and family. requirements, while the allowances given to the unemployed are insufficient to provide the recipients with proper maintenance. In such conditions, rent strikes and arrears are inevitable. Since 1921, when unemployment became acute in , the Clyde valley, rent disorders have been manifested in Greenock, Port-Glasgow, Paisley, Dumbarton, Hamilton, Cambuslang, Falkirk, and various parts of Glasgow. In many of these localities there was serious disorder before there was any trouble in Clydebank. It should be borne in mind that the Clyde area has suffered most from unemployment in the past four years, and as a consequence strong objections were offered in this locality to increased rent. The popular demand of the tenants is for a return to pre-war rents for pre-war houses. That demand arises from economic necessity. It is, significant that there was no difficulty about the payment of rent when tenants were receiving regular and reasonable incomes. Tenants only organise to reduce rents when economic conditions compel them to seek relief in that way.PreAVar Rent.My colleagues, in their report, narrate the history of the present dispute and, the reasons for our Inquiry. I need not cover the same ground, as I am in general agreement with their statement of fasts. I agree with the summary of general conclu-sions with the exception of numbers 6, 8, 10, and 11, and with the recommendations except numbers 1 and 8. I cannot, however, accept their conclusions and recom-mendations as. wholly satisfactory. They do not go far enough. The tenants&apos; representatives, who appeared before the Inquiry, proved, in my opinion, their case for a reduction in rent, in view of existing circumstances. Their evidence left no doubt in my mind that the majority of working-class tenants are unable to afford the present rents. It was generally admitted that, apart from Clydebank, owners are obtaining better returns now than they have obtained for many years, while it is apparent that factors, who are paid on. commission, are enjoying unusual prosperity. The higher the rents, the better for the factors, and the latter are reaping the fullest advantage from the abnormal conditions which prevail. There may be a few owners, who, because of special reasons, are receiving diminished returns from property invest-ments. On the.other hand, there is no denying that wage earners, whose incomes have been reduced, or who have been deprived of their employment, are heavily burdened by increased rent and other charges., and that their plight calls for sympathetic consideration. Their incomes must be increased or their, rents reduced. This Commission has no power to increase working-class incomes, but it has power to recommend a reduction of rent. The Government would render excellent service if it would reduce,REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS BY COUNCILLOR DOLLAN.
considerably, the 40 per cent, increase on pre-war rents allowed by the Rent Restriction Acts. My view is that a serious attempt should be made to lower rents to the pre-war level, and that a start should be made by withdrawing 25 per cent, of the permitted increase. This concession would modify the rent difficulties in the poorest areas. I recommend the Government to adopt this course, and recall that the Committee of M.P.&apos;s, who investigated the Clydebank dispute in August, 1924, declared : With reference to the claim for a return to 1914 rents, and having in mind the conditions of industry and the -wages paid to workers, the Committee subscribe themselves in favour of. the vietos expressed that Government action should be taken to place houses built before the war back upon the pre-war rent basis.I concur in that view, and give the following reasons in support of it. When the Government announced in 1920 that owners would be allowed a 40 per cent, increase, plus the increase in owners&apos; rates to that date, there was serious apprehension in civic and other responsible circles that such a heavy increase would cause injustice to tenants. The question was discussed in the Glasgow Corporation (11/6/20) when Sir Thomas Paxton moved that the Government be petitioned to restrict the increase to 25 per Cent. His motion was adopted by 31 votes against 20 for an amendment that pre-war rents should be maintained. Sir Thomas then said : &quot;To come forward with this big advance at once would cause great commotion and serious hardship to many classes of people.. Certain classes might be able and -willing to pay, but there -was a huge class who were quite unable to do so, as their incomes had not increased, and they had been struggling on all these years. He thought 25 per cent, a fair figure.&quot;An increase of 37J per cent, was imposed in 1920, and a further 10 per cent, in 1921. Protests were made throughout Scotland against these increases, which were regarded as a violation of a pledge given by the Premier in 1918 that &quot; there would be no rent war.&quot; This pledge was taken to mean that pre-war rents would be maintained, and the increases were resented for that and other reasons. Nevertheless, the protests subsided, and tenants continued to pay the increases so long as wages and employment remained fair. In the middle of 1921, unemployment began to increase, and at the end of that year 78,544 were unemployed in Glasgow, 5,006 in Clydebank, 4,588 in Paisley, 7,186 in Greenock, and 4,261 in Hamilton. Wages also began to fall rapidly, distress and poverty became widespread; the Clyde shipbuilding, engineering, the coal mining and iron industries of Lanarkshire were semi-paralysed. As a consequence, &quot;rent strikes&quot; have been frequent since. The property owners have had no difficulty in collecting rents in &quot;residential&quot; areas where incomes were maintained at a comfortable standard. The Kelvinside and Dumbreck areas of Glasgow had no rent strikes, for the simple reason that the wealthy tenants who live there have always had ample means.    Most of the witnesses, giving evidence
for owners, at the Inquiry, admitted that there would have been less difficulty if regular wages and employment had remained. Mr. John Cameron, President of the National Federation of Property Owners and Factors of Scotland, stated, in cross-examination (Page 1764, Official report) that he believed&quot;it to be true that the people in the Clyde area were less able to pay increased rent than the people in other parts of Scotland.&quot;Decline in Wages.Pie also admitted that the troubles in connection with the Rent Acts were due to distress and unemployment rather than to legal difficulties. Mr. Robert Gilmour, President of the Property Owners&apos; and Factors&apos; Association, Glasgow, stated in his evidence, &quot;while the cost of living remained high it was a most inopportune &quot;time from the tenants&apos; point of view to raise rents.&quot; Mr. J. B. Stewart, a leading factor in Clydebank, said (Page 144, Official Report), &quot;we get more trouble when conditions are bad.&quot; The increases of rent allowed by the Acts involved an extra annual payment of at least  5,000,000 in rent, plus heavy sums in increased rates, by tenants in Scotland. In Glasgow alone the permitted increase in rent amounted to  1,250,000 per annum (Page 1594, Official Report); in Greenock at least  60,000; in Paisley  61,729; in Clydebank  45,000; in Dumbarton  35,000; in Hamilton  46,000; and in Cambuslang  25,000. An additional gain to the owners in all these towns was the payment of rent for houses which were empty before the War. An abnormal advance occurred in Parish Council rates in respect of relief to the able-bodied unemployed and their dependants. Twelve parishes in the rent strike area expended over  900,000 in unemployment relief in 1923 (Board of Health Report, page 244-5). The rate for this relief in Old Kilpatrick, which includes Clydebank, is four and a half times greater than in Edinburgh. Clyde tenants had specially weighted burdens to carry, and, at a time when real wages declined below a reasonable standard. It was estimated before the Inquiry that wages -in Glasgow were reduced  10,000,000 to  15,000,000 per annum, and in Clydebank the reduction was calculated at  700,000. It is beyond dispute that working-class tenants are now in a much worse state economically than they were in 1920, and consequently less able to pay the higher rents demanded. Mr. William Shaw, secretary of the Glasgow Trades and Labour Council, in his evidence, estimated that the increase in the gross rents of the cheapest working-class houses varied from 2/9 to 4/9J per week compared with 1920, while in most trades wages decreased in the same period 25/- to 40/- a week. Other witnesses for the tenants corroborated. It should be remembered, moreover, that broken time and suspension of wages are now more common facts than during the war. A reduction in rent would be of immediate benefit to the poorer tenants, whose life is one monotonous procession of drudgery and want. There are special sections of the population, such as old-age pensioners, widows, unemployed, the underpaid, the sick and destitute, who have suffered undue privations because of the unprecedented increase in rent.   Property owners made no exception in the
imposition of their legal charges, which were demanded of com-comfortable and destitute alike.An argument used against a reduction of rent was that it would lead to an increase in rates. The increase in rates, so far as the tenant is concerned, would be only a few shillings per annum, as against which even the lowest rented tenant would save  3 to  4 in rent.Wages and Rent.The Inquiry demonstrated, that, even if rents are reduced 25 per cent., it would still be exceedingly difficult for unemployed and underpaid homes to, maintain efficiency and pay normal rent out of existing income. The solution of this difficulty is out with the scope of our inquiry, but it is obvious there always will be a rent problem of this character until unemployment allowances and wages are raised to a decent standard. The overwhelming majority of eviction cases have been drawn from the unemployed and low wage sections of the community, for whom the pressure of living did not leave a margin with which to pay normal rent. The Unemployment Insurance allowance and the&apos; Parish Council scale of relief provide only a meagre subsistence, yet it was reported to us by Mr. Cleveland Ellis, General Superintendent of Poor, Scottish Board of Health, that the allowances paid to a couple and four children &quot;exceeded in some districts the wages being earned by independent unskilled labourers in fidl-time employment. This teas observable especially in areas where ship-building and engineering are predominant industries.&quot; These remarks by Mr. Ellis apply particularly to the Clyde and West Scotland region, where the wages of labourers are as low as from. 35/- to 39/- a week. Frequently this rate is reduced by broken time, and when this occurs the labourer is lucky to have 30/- a week. Many groups of tradesmen receive less than  3 a week, and in their homes also the pressure of living must be rigorous. As one witness commented : &quot;You can&apos;t be on friendly terms with your landlord when you don&apos;t get enough to eat.&quot; Witnesses for the, tenants maintain that the minimum income for a Clydeside family should not fall below  315/- a week, if all household obligations were to be met fairly. Several witnesses stated frankly that when incomes were inadequate a contest was sure to arise as to whether bread or rent was the first charge on income. It was. declared there was an increasing tendency to give the preference to bread, and to place rent in a lower place than formerly in the category of domestic expenditure. This is not surprising, and in Clydebank, particularly, this justifiable prefer-ence for bread explains part of the difficulty in connection with the payment of rent. During the whole course of the Inquiry, I do not recollect one factor or owner complaining that there was any trouble collecting rents in the period 1915-21, when employ-ment and wages were regular. Most tenants pay rent willingly, when their incomes permit of such being clone without impairing the supply of vital necessities for the household. Working-class women, as dispensers of the family income, have always an anxious; time on account of straitened and irregular household income. Only the minority are assured of a regular income each week of the year.   I marvel at the ingenuity and patience with
92which they perform their financial task of 1 making ends meet. The Government ought to tackle this poverty problem with a view to ensuring that every family will have adequate maintenance to provide for efficiency in food, clothing, shelter, and other essentials. There will always be rent difficulties until the poverty problem is solved. There is urgent call for a Government inquiry into the conditions of the poor, with a view to the formulation of a policy which would secure an efficient maintenance for each family.Rents and Income.Rents of working-class houses are excessive in proportion to accommodation received. I also formed the impression that too big a proportion of wages was consumed by rent. On average, probably a sixth of income is paid in rent. This applies to artisans. Labourers are occasionally affected more severely. The inability of tenants to pay normal rent out of ordinary wages promotes sub-letting and overcrowding. There are modern two-apartment houses in Clydebank, the rents of which are now  27 per annum, exclusive of rates. The tenants of these houses are mainly employed in a local shipyard, in which wages are paid in accordance with the trade agreement. A labourer has 38/- a week, an artisan  3. It seems to me impossible for tenants in such circumstances to pay the high rents demanded of them. The owners of this property state that it is not remunerative as an investment, although it no doubt has an economic value as an auxiliary to their works. It is an unhappy position that employers are unable to pay wages which do not permit of a proper standard of living for worker-tenants. The rent struggle in Clydebank, properly understood, is not an antagonism between tenants and owners so much as an expression of discontent by the tenants against an industrial order which does not afford them a reason-able maintenance. The tenants were insistent that they had no personal quarrel with owners.Clydebank Crisis.The unfortunate crisis in Clydebank, as elsewhere, has arisen from the poverty of the tenants. A small minority would have been able to pay increased rent in the past two years, but not so the majority. Luckily, the latter were protected by the Courts against the payment of increased rent. Otherwise, hundreds of evictions might have occurred, owing to the non-payment of the higher rent. The tenants, the law on their side, have taken full advantage of it as a means of aiding them over their poverty difficulties. The owners and factors have themselves to blame for the issue of the faulty increase notices, which were declared illegal by the Court, and they are now paying the penalty. It is regrettable that the owners and factors, when their increase notices were declared invalid, did not conform to the law by accepting the legal tender of pre-war rent, pending an appeal to a superior Court, with a view to a final settlement. This disregard of the law led to reprisals by the tenants. Regarding eviction disorders, the tenants&apos; witnesses, in their evidence, were emphatic that the citizens only interfered to protect families in distress from
eviction. It has been characteristic of the Scottish people to protect their homes against harsh treatment, and Clydebank followed tradition in this respect. Tenants in Govan, Parkhead, Cambuslang, and other localities also offered vigorous defiance to what they believed were unfair evictions. I cannot censure&apos;them for acting as defenders of the sanctity of the home. The evidence led before the Inquiry all went to prove that the Clydebank people are a law-abiding, sober, and well-behaved community, who have a pride in their children, homes, and town. Their local patriotism and civic sense are admirable, and more than one witness spoke favourably of the excellent care bestowed upon the children by parents. Provost MacDonald and other witnesses were agreed that the local efforts at concilation failed because of the owners&apos; refusal to accept the legal tender of pre-war rent as decided upon by the local Sheriff Court. The Town and Parish Council are in no way to blame for the prolongation of the dispute, and their rating difficulties should be recognised accordingly. In Glasgow the owners and factors adopted more conciliatory methods of dealing with tenants in distress, and consequently were able to maintain better relations. By this policy they avoided very serious disturbance. A number of witnesses spoke favourably of the reasonableness of some factors in Glasgow in comparison with the &quot;terrorism&quot; practised elsewhere.The recommendations outlined in the major report should help to secure a modification of the abnormal condition which prevails in Clydebank. The Government, however, should give special assistance to the rating authorities to enable them to liquidate the arrears of rates which have accrued because of circumstances outwith the control of the Town and Parish Council.It should be noted that, in their campaign for lower rent, the tenants in Clydebank have relied throughout on legal decisions, and in the majority of cases were acting in accordance with the law. They cannot be blamed for the legal muddle and confusion arising from the administration of Acts framed by legal experts. Both tenants and owners have shown an uncommon affection for litigation, which in the Sheriffdom of Dumbartonshire has had favourable results for the tenants. The tenants claim that their methods are constitutional, and in accord with the Court procedure.A New Act.While holding strongly the belief that the cause of the rent difficulties is purely economic in origin, the position is complicated by the involved and crossword-puzzle wording of the various Acts. These Acts are almost impossible of understanding by the ordinary tenant, and are an endless source of confusion and annoyance. Legislation which affects almost every home should be drafted in plain terms, so that those affected could appreciate its meaning without having to call in legal interpreters to explain what the law means. The present Acts should be scrapped, and a new, simplified, and co-ordinated measure passed in its place. An Act dealing with tenants should be as simple in its terms as the Sermon on the Mount. I think the Inquiry proved the need for a separate Act for Scotland, where house property is different in character
from house property jn England, and administered in a different way. Many legal tangles which have arisen in connection with the Acts are certainly due to the fact that the Government, when framing the Acts, assumed housing conditions and rents were similar in both countries. An Act based entirely on Scottish conditions would be more acceptable, and less likely to create legal conundrums. All the leading witnesses for both sides, and most of the official experts, pronounced in favour of an amending Act which would unify house-letting, rent, and ratings law in Scotland. Such an amending Act would reduce litigation and contention, because it would be based on an experience and knowledge of Scottish conditions in relation to rent, taxes, and tenancy.Uniform Control.The evidence showed the need also for uniform control of all houses coming within the scope of the Rent Restriction Act. The system of allowing houses to become decontrolled on a change of tenancy leads to unjust anomalies and increased rent. When this occurs in properties where there are also controlled houses, one can appreciate the injustice. The tenant of the decontrolled house has not only to pay increased rent, but also must pay extra rates levied on the increase. This is obviously unfair. Mr. Alex. Walker, the City Assessor of Glasgow, stated that in 1924 the rents of 1109 decontrolled houses had been increased by amounts ranging from  1 to  14 10/- per annum above the con-trolled rents. In one case the increase is equal to 68 per cent, above pre-war rent. If, as the Factors&apos; Association allege, the factors do not encourage the increase of rent of decontrolled houses, they ought not to have any objection to uniform control. I recommend that control be made uniform, and that the new Act be amended accordingly. It is significant that all the owners&apos; witnesses admitted that general decontrol of housing was impracticable at present. Tenants, however, complained about the uncertainty of control due to the.short term Acts which have been passed on the subject. More security is required, and .in Scotland, at any rate, there is no prospect of the supply of houses exceeding the demand within the next fifteen years. The amend-ing Act ought to provide for a continuance of control for at least ten years, and thereby promote security of tenancy and reduce the anxieties arising from too frequent interference by Parliament in this matter. There is not, in my opinion, the same need for control of larger houses, which are now more abundant. The only recommendation I make for larger houses, is that the local authorities should have power to prevent such houses being kept empty (with a view to sale), and should be authorised to take over such premises for the accommodation of overcrowded families.Ejection Procedure.The procedure in the Ejection Courts came in for criticism by several witnesses, but, with the exception of one Court, it was agreed that those responsible for the administration of the courts were as considerate as the law and circumstances would permit. Eviction cases, however, in my opinion, are too hurriedly dealt
with, and there is not enough judicial examination of the facts in each case. It ought to be possible for the Court to decide each case on the merits. Owing to the hurried procedure in some courts, tenants often are obliged to leave without knowing what decision is recorded in their cases. This is unsatisfactory. The humblest defendant, in any case, ought to receive the fullest consideration for his case, which, I regret to state, does not prevail in eviction litigation. The excuse given for this lack of -consideration is &quot;congestion of Court business.&quot; That is an argument for increased administrative facilities, and not an excuse for hasty judgment. The administration of the law relating to rent is important, and proper arrangements should be made for its careful execution. It will be unfortunate if the poorest are made to feel that law is a cynical abstraction without regard for their humble but serious anxieties. A poor woman, threatened with eviction on account of poverty, undergoes more anxiety at the mere thought of ejection from her home than most people imagine. Her claim for consideration ought to receive careful adjudication; and thereby reduce the danger of mistakes arising through undue haste. In the larger cities there is need for an Advisory Bureau at each Sheriff Court, to give guidance to tenants and other poor litigants on procedure. Large numbers of defendants in eviction and arrears cases are confused by the hurried procedure, and are often&apos; astounded when they learn later of the decisions recorded against them. Is it too much to expect that a written decision should be supplied in such cases ? It is regrettable that so many tenants allow their wives to appear as defendants in the Eviction Court. The men ought to appear on their own behalf, unless where appearances would involve the loss of work or income. Otherwise there is no excuse for men delegating this duty to women, who, in many cases, are already overburdened with responsibilities.Another unfortunate aspect is that there is an increasing-tendency by factors to summon all tenants, in arrears, to the Eviction Court, irrespective of the circumstances. This form of legal terrorism causes grave annoyance and&apos; nervous hurt to hundreds of mothers, who have never been in Court before, and who imagine a summons to the Court means summary ejection for the family. The tenants have generally to pay the expense of these proceedings, which are more frequent than necessary. An objectionable practice is the sending out of &quot;48 hours eviction &quot;notices&quot; to controlled tenants, who do not know that such notices are ineffectual. The work of the Sheriff Court would be simplified by an arrangement which would enable all cases of arrears to be dealt with by a local relief committee before being brought into court. This could be operated by district committees in large towns much in the same manner as both Committees deal with claims under the Unemployment Insurance Act. All unemployed and low wage tenants ought to have an opportunity of going before such committees.Repairs.Witnesses for the tenants complained that owners and factors were spending less on ordinary internal repairs, and in my opinion, this complaint is well founded.   Factors admitted they were not
spending the whole of the portion of the permitted increase allowed in respect of repairs, viz. : 25 per cent. Mr. William Faulds, an ex-president of the Property Owners&apos; and Factors&apos; Association, stated that the sum of  538,628 was expended by owners on repairs in 1922, as compared with  366,712 in the year before the War. No returns were put in showing how much was expended in 1923 and 1924, in which years materials and wages were reduced, considerably. The 25 per cent, allowed the owners in respect of repairs, is equal to  762,635 per annum for Glasgow. No evidence was tendered to prove that even half that sum is now expended on repairs. The tendency of owners is to hold back repairs until compelled to do so. Under Section 25 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, and other statutes, local authorities are empowered to compel owners to carry out reasonable repairs. Tenants are more likely to obtain satisfaction by an appeal to the Local Authority, and accordingly all questions re repairs should be dealt with under the Housing Acts. There is undoubted evidence that pressure by individual tenants is of little avail in compelling factors to carry out repairs, and it would seem as if owners were determined to spend as little as possible in improving the comfort of houses. Cases were reported to us of tenants having to pay part of the cost of structural and other internal repairs. Organisation by the tenants might effect an improvement of the grievance concerning repairs.Prior to the war it was the custom for papering and renovation to be done at the expense of the owner. The tenant has to pay now or go without. One witness estimated that this extra duty imposed on the tenants a. charge which amounted to a further rise in rent of from 1/- to 2/- a week, according to the size of the house.   In many cases this cost is exceeded.Insanitary Houses.A number of witnesses emphasised the problem of insanitary houses, and the general view expressed by tenants&apos; representatives was that increased rent was demanded for &quot;insanitary&quot; and habitable houses alike. Before the war, it was stated, there were at least 13,000 &quot;insanitary&quot; houses in Glasgow, most of which are now occupied by tenants who are paying increased rent in common with other occupiers. Paisley, Greenock, Clydebank, Port-Glasgow, and other places have each their quota of condemned or insanitary houses. The famine in accommodation has delayed the demolition of many of these houses, but that is no excuse for keeping them without repairs, especially when the tenants are paying increased rent. A few instances were given of house- in which artificial light had to be maintained day and night. Other regrettable features could be enumerated to fill a volume. The owner of the insanitary house has no incentive to carry out repairs so long as he is able to exact normal rent. He ought to be penalised in the same way as the owner of any other commodity which is injurious to public health. The best way to do this would be to suspend, entirely the right of the owners of insanitary houses to collect rent until the houses had been repaired to the satisfaction of the Local. Authority. The tenants of such houses, should pay rate charges only, during the suspension of rent.   I
recommend an amendment of the law accordingly. Moreover, owners who are habitual offenders against the housing and public health laws should be dealt with as criminal offenders. The law, as it stands, is far too lenient to owners who neglect their duty.External Repairs.I visited tenement properties, and there saw conditions which were almost incredibly sordid. The external state of the close and lobbies was insanitary in the extreme. The plaster was broken in many parts, and the stairs were ruinous with decay. The lavatory accommodation was primitive, one w.c. for a group of five families on each flat. The windows in several houses had been broken for months. The walls of the close and stairway were filthy with dirt, and had not been painted since before the War. The tenants assured me they had made numerous complaints to the factors, but without effect. There are twenty houses in the tenement, the entrance lobbies in which are as dark at noon as night. This property was one of the many tenements in a similar state in a populous street in Glasgow. Such streets as this are not uncommon, and indicate that unwilling owners can render futile the efforts of the public health authority to improve the amenities of congested areas. There is an urgent need for more sanitary inspectors to enforce laws with regard to the hygienic maintenance of house property, but an even more effective remedy would be the formation of street committees of tenants, whose duty it would be to insist on the improvement of their general housing conditions. Such committees would be a healthy stimulus for careless owners and factors. From what I saw in this and other congested areas, I am convinced that repairs are the last thing many owners think about.Rates and Housing.Much was said by witnesses for the owners concerning what they alleged was a special hardship imposed upon them in respect of the increase in owners&apos; rates. The tenants have also had to bear an increase in occupiers&apos; rates. In some towns the owners&apos; rates are almost as low as they were before the War. I was impressed, however, with the arguments of both tenants and owners in favour of a new system of municipal revenue being-obtained by a tax on income, property, and land, on a basis which would exempt houses from rates. The case for the tax-free house, within certain limitation, is as valid as the case for tax-free food. This does not come within the scope of our remit, but I hope the need for rating reform will be dealt with at an early date. The present method of imposing rates on house rents in inequitable, and is tantamount to a tax on the family. In alb gross rent pay-ments, rates and rents should be distinguished clearly, so that those concerned would know their financial position as ratepayers and as tenants.Factor Combines.The Inquiry made it clear to me that it would improve relations between tenant and owner if organised opinion could be
924evolved to adjust disputes which arise from day to day. The factors have a powerful organisation, which, with the shortage of houses, tends to give them an unfair advantage over individual tenants. The administration of house property in Scotland is now controlled largely by factor syndicates, some of which are able to dictate terms to owners as well as tenants. The individual tenant is too weak to obtain justice, by his own efforts, in the matter of repairs, amenities, and charges. If the tenants were organised, they would, be able to meet the organised factors and negotiate agreements, which might be observed by both parties. The formation of tenants&apos; associations should be encouraged, with a view to obtaining reasonable observance of laws intended to benefit and protect householders, and also for the purpose of main-taining a constant interest in the need for the greater production of improved housing at lower rents. Individual management of property is passing away, and individual ownership is tending in the same direction. In the towns of the West of Scotland there is practically no personal contact between the actual owners of property and the tenants. The majority of owners have no personal knowledge of the conditions and circumstances in which tenants live. The chief concern of the factor combines is to collect rent and make profit, which is not conducive to good relations between the rent collector and the tenant. There are combines which factor from two to six thousand houses each. In one town a firm has almost a monopoly of factoring. Such arrangements render it impossible for the heads of the combines to become acquainted with the circumstances of tenants, and have produced a rigid system of administration which is too impersonal. The tenants can only protect themselves by forming organisations, which would be able to obtain fair conditions by opposing the organised power of the tenants to combat the syndicated power of the factors. As conditions now are, the tenants are unable to meet the factors on an equal footing, and consequently are obliged to submit to terms which otherwise would not be acceptable.Unemployed Relief.Both owners and tenants were agreed that the cost of unemployed relief should not be a charge upon the rates. The Parish Councils in the Clyde area have been obliged to incur serious financial responsibilities for unemployed relief, which, of course, has been made a charge upon occupiers&apos; and owners&apos; rates, and form a big element in gross rent. It would ease the situation for both parties if the maintenance of the unemployed was removed entirely from the rates and .the whole financial responsibility assumed by the State. An alternative would be for the State to repay to Parish Councils the full expenditure incurred on relief to the able-bodied unemployed. Both owners and tenants in the Clyde area are unfairly handicapped by this burden in comparison with other areas. I doubt if any region in Great Britain has been as much stricken by unemployment as the Clyde area, the Parish Councils in which ought to receive special help from the State in respect of the abnormal distress they have to relieve. As I have already stated, twelve industrial area Parish Councils in the
Clyde region had to expend over  900,000 in unemployment relief in one year, which is undeniably disproportionate. This addition to the Parish Council rates has aggravated the rent worries.Unemployed Tenants.These form a special class, requiring special treatment. The unemployment allowances and Parish Council relief are not adequate for all-in maintenance, and should be augmented, at least, by an amount which would enable the unemployed to pay their rent. If such were done, I would favour an examination of rent books, to ensure that the allowance was expended in the payment of rent. Otherwise, I would oppose examination. There is no doubt that rent relief funds in Glasgow, Greenock, Paisley, and other places, have been of great assistance to unemployed tenants in preventing evictions. Had it not been for the humane administration of these funds, thousands of eviction cases would have occurred in the Clyde Valley, and, as a consequence, serious disorder and conflict would have resulted. The State ought to provide an allowance which would ensure an all-in maintenance for the unemployed and their families.Key Money.The illegal practice of charging key money or premiums from new tenants was stated to be common, at least in Glasgow. The City Assessor informed us of numerous complaints made to him by tenants who had been victimised in this way. A premium of  10 was not exceptional. Another malpractice is to oblige new tenants to pay the arrears of outgoing tenants as a condition of occupancy. It was also complained that factors shared in the proceeds of the sale of furniture sold by outgoing, tenants to incomers. In these cases, the incomers must buy the furniture as a condition of getting possession of the house. The prices charged are sometimes unreasonable; but, in any case, the practice is open to abuse. The Factors&apos; Association are opposed to key money and similar malpractices, but that does not prevent their continuance. The imprisonment of a few factors might stop this corrupt method of obtaining unlawful sums. Some factors, we were told, did not charge .key money on condition the new-tenants made over their insurance to the companies for which factors acted as agents. The detection of all the illegalities arising from the administration of the Rent Acts would occupy an army of detectives, and, even then, the parties concerned would evade the law if it were profitable to do so. Local authorities should encourage tenants to report all cases of demands for illegal payments; and in Glasgow the City Assessor has an effective method of dealing with such complaints. Key money would be more prevalent than it is were it not for his vigilance in protecting tenants. Some tenants, in then- desperation to obtain homes, are only too willing to offer key money, in order to obtain an advantage over other competitors for the same houses.Housing Conditions.The Inquiry revealed the terrible shortage of housing in the area affected by the rent strikes, and, according to evidence
53submitted, there is a clamant need for a minimum supply of 150,000 new houses in the Clyde region, to relieve existing wants The standard of accommodation of present. houses is inferior to what it should be. Too many families are crowded together in one and two-apartment houses. In Glasgow, we were informed, over 40,000 families resided in one-apartment houses, and 162,000 families in two-apartment houses, while more than 3000 houses were each occupied by more than one family. Less than 6000 new houses had been completed in the municipal schemes between the Armistice and the date of our Inquiry. Private enterprise had evidently not built any working-class houses since 1912, and apparently had decided to leave the provision of such houses in the future to the municipality. A document was quoted in evidence to show that owners and factors protested in 1913 against the Town Council building municipal houses, on the plea that tire supply was then adequate ! The housing conditions in Greenock, Paisley, Dumbarton, and other places, were reported to us as being worse than in Glasgow. Even a comparatively new town like Clydebank was stated by the Medical Officer of Health to have houses which were &quot;a disgrace to civilisation,&quot; while Paisley had 300 occupied houses in such, an &quot;insanitary and uninhabitable condition that they ought to be closed.&quot; An estimate given was that more than 750 houses in Paisley were each ocrapied by two or more families, and. that 50 per cent, of the 3000 ticketed houses in the town were also overcrowded. A Greenock witness declared the overcrowded in his town numbered at least twenty thousand souls. Fifty-eight per cent, of the population dwell in one and two-apartment houses, and a witness estimated that at least 25 per cent, of these small houses had more than one family in residence. Sub-letting, he said, was common in two-apartment houses. It does not come within the scope of our remit to make recommendations re housing, but the urgency of the problem cannot be ignored in any report dealing with the administration of the Rent Acts. It is obvious from the evidence we heard that the low standard of housing, and the shortage, of supply, are the cause of social discontent. If the construction of new houses is not hastened, grave disorder will arise, as an educated people will not remain content if crowded together in tigly and unhygienic tenements which are totally unsuited to the modern requirements of family and social amenity.A great social effort ought to be made to create an environment for the working classes such as would enable them to have more comfort, beauty, and adventure in their lives. None of us can be complacent about the dangers of poverty brought to the notice of the Inquiry.The outstanding fact, impressed on my mind in reviewing.the evidence, is the anxiety and worry of poor women who are unable to pay rent and other charges from the monies they now receive for household management.Recommendations.The following recommendations, which I submit for the consideration of the Government, will, I believe, confer a benefit upon hundreds of thousands of tenants, without, in any way,925
20th May, 1925.causing economic injury to property owners and factors, who have been generously treated in the past few years. My reform proposals are : -(1) A new Scottish Rent Act should be enacted, in the simplest language, with a view to the avoidance of litigation.(2) Rent control should be continued for a minimum period of ten years.(3) All houses not exceeding  45 rent, exclusive of rates, should be subject to rent control, so as to secure uniformity of treatment for all tenants coming within this category.(4) An immediate reduction of 25 per cent, in the rents of controlled houses, and a further reduction within a maximum period of two years.(5) The suspension of the payment of any rent, exclusive of rates, for houses which are certified as insanitary, the landlord to recover rent as from the date on which the house is certified to be in proper repair.(6) The increase of unemployment allowances by an amount which would enable the recipients to pay rent in accordance with the law.(7) State grants to local authorities in unemployment areas, to compensate them (1) for loss of rates due to distress and (2) for payments in respect of unemployment relief by Parish Councils.(8) The appointment of local joint committees in each burgh and county area to deal with all rent and eviction cases prior to their being dealt with by the Sheriffs.(9) Increased penalties upon owners who exact premiums and key money, or unfair profit, from the sale of furniture to incoming tenants. Imprisonment would be a deterrent.(10) The establishment of tenants&apos;  advice bureaux in the municipal offices in each town and county area, wheretenants would receive advice and information on all questions affecting rates and rent. (11) The encouragement of the formation of tenants&apos; organ isa-tions and their recognition in all questions affecting therights of tenants. (12) The appointment of special housing inspectors in each townand county area to supervise the execution of properrepairs for all houses. (13) Local authorities to be empowered to take over emptyhouses which are suitable for occupation. (14) Periodical surveys of houses by local authorities, with aview to ascertaining if houses are kept in proper repair.(Signed)   P. J. DOLL AN.
