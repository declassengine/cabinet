j       NoT ^-SECRET. j        Tjv.6 oocxs    t^T Copy No.   3QCP. 287(35) -, !THE CABINET.IMPERIAL WAR GRAVES COMMISSION. (Endowment Fund.)MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Though the Cabinet on 11th March last approved the principle of the establishment     118 of this fund, to be administered under the Charter of the Imperial War Graves Commission,   General and at two subsequent meetings discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the way     103 in which effect should be given to this decision, I regret to say that nothing has yet been settled.   Proposals which the Chancellor has made to me since the meeting of 17th April are unacceptable as they avoid the real issue, providing no guarantee that the graves will be maintained at their present generally accepted standard and in perpetuity.   They contain nothing of practical value which will satisfy the Commission or even allay the natural anxiety aroused in their minds by the Treasury&apos;s suggestions for materially reducing the standard of maintenance.Meanwhile the Governments of Canada and Australia, with the same facts before them as the British Government, have accepted the Commission^ proposal that their present contributions should be continued for a period of years to meet all current expenditure on construction and to provide an Endowment Fund of  5,000,000 for permanent maintenance.Mr. Bruce, the Prime Minister of Australia, cabled last February to the British Prime Minister urging the establishment of such a fund with a &quot; quite adequate&quot; endowment, and. one of the last acts of Mr. Massey also was to cable personally to the Prime Minister informing him that the New Zealand Government were prepared to take any legislative action that might be necessary to guarantee their share of the cost of permanent maintenance on the basis estimated. The Government of Canada has for some time been pressing the Commission for information as to whether their offer is accepted, so that they may make the necessary provision in their Estimates.The Dominion Governments take a very great interest in the Imperial War Graves Commission and have frequently expressed their satisfaction at the working of an organization definitely set up by the Imperial Conference, and have on more than one occasion pointed to this organization as a most hopeful symptom of Imperial co-operation. , I feel strongly that the effect on Imperial relations will be most unfortunate if we continue to receive the offers which the Dominions have made with indifference. Further, as this discussion drags on, there is increasing danger that it may lead to public discontent in this country. It is to the credit of the Commission that so far no unrest in this connection has been allowed to develop among the relatives.1 may add, as showing the inconvenience which this hesitation is causing to the work of the Commission, that Sir Fabian Ware, the Vice-Chairman, promised the Canadian Government that he would go to Canada to lecture on the Commission^ work last autumn, and again in the spring, and on both occasions has had to postpone his visit as this matter was under discussion, and he is still unable to accept their pressing invitation for next September.(B25/17)   75   6/25   W.O.P.   1892Printed for the Cabinet, June, 1925.
I regret that I have not been able to come to an agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I hope that he will now accept and that the Cabinet will agree to the proposal I made on 1st April last (CP. 191 (25) ), viz. :  1,125,000 for each of the first 2 years, and  1,000,000 a year for each of the next 3 years, and about  500,000 a year for each of the next 6 years.L. W.-E.The War Office,13^ June, 1925.
