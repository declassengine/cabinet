THIS DOCUHEHT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cabinet..UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.        There are three matters connected with Unemployment (25)        Insurance which I should be glad to have discussed by theCabinet as matters of urgency.     I had hoped to have been able to take a little more time over, the matter, but as things are a statement is advisable next Thursday In the House of Commons of the Government proposals regarding the future of Unemployment Insurance.     These three matters are:-(a) Legislation that will be required this year.(b) Restriction of conditions of benefit,(c) The appointment in the autumn of a Committee of Enquiry Into the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, preparatory to settling the lines of legislation required before June, 1926,In   connection with these points it will be rememberedby my colleagues that the Act of 1924 provides for a completecessation of benefit in June, 1926,    In other words, besides the Act of this year, a further and more comprehensive Act willin any case be necessary early in 1926.^ * Leg3-s3-&amp;t ion in the present year *The Unemployment Insurance Act of last August bringsinto force on 1st October, 1925, a requirement that nounemployment benefit (whether standard or extended) is to bepaid to any person who has paid less than 30 contributions sincethe beginning of the last two preceding insurance years.   Upto the 1st October this requirement can be waived by theMinister of Labour.   The full requirement of SO contributions/would
would mean the disqualification of something like 200,000 op 250,000 persons and is therefore not conceivably practicable in present circumstance3,   The power of waiver must therefore be continued after 1st October and a Bill is necessary this Session for this purpose.3*   Restriction of conditions of benefit requiring legislation.(a) Waiting period.I should propose to include in the Bill a clause prolonging the &quot;Waiting period&quot; from 3 days to 6, i.e, to the same length as existed before the Labour Government1s Act of last year.   The reduction then was resisted in Committee by the Government of the day and was defeated but on report stage a different view was taken and the 5 day period was introduced notwithstanding the admission that the resultant cost would necessarily prolong considerably the &quot;deficiency period.&quot;   I think the change may excite opposition, but that opposition will be more fictitious than inherently violent.(k) Rates of benefit.I have considered the question of a possible reduction in the rates of benefit.   The rates were raised last year from 15/- to 18/- in the case of men, and from 12/- to 15/-In the case of women; together with certain Increases in the rates paid to dependent children.     The pros and cons, however, of the question are too long to be Included in this memorandum, and I append a separate note on the point.   In any event, the proposal would be so controversial that It could not (having regard to the present state of public business) be included In this year&apos;s Bill.A.
4.   Restriction of Conditions of Benefit for whichloftislation is &quot;desTrable but1 &quot;not&quot;wholly necessary.I have considered whether it would be right to re-impose the restrictions affecting certain classes which were relaxed when the Labour Government took office In February, 1924.   The classes affected are;-(a) single persons residing with parents or relatives who can support them;(b) married women living with their husbands who are in employment;(c) persons who are working short-time and whose Incomings are sufficient to justify the withholding of extended benefit;(d) certain classes of aliens.These restrictions were Imposed originally in the exercise of a discretionary power vested In the Minister prior to the Labour Governments Act of last year and they were removed by Mr.Shaw under the same authority.     This particular discretion was taken away from the Minister by the Act of 1924, I am advised however that in strict legality I have the power, through a manipulation of my right of waiver to reimpose these restrictions In part.   So reimposed however they could only apply to a much more limited class of cases than that to which the restrictions previously applied.   Moreover, the Parliamentary case against us for re-imposing them administratively, would be a strong one as we should be stretching our legal powers to defeat the declared intention of the Act of 1924.     If it is Intended therefore to re-Impose the restrictions, it would be better to do so openly by means of a clause in the Bill -possibly a clause which would restore the general discretion of the Minister as to the granting or withholding of extended benefit.   I suggest, therefore, that no action be/taken
taken with regard to these restrictions until the whole position of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme has been enquired Into by the Committee. 5.   Committee of Enquiry.On the general question of the principles and the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, I think it is essential that before we decide what legislation is required to take the place of the existing arrangements which come to an end in June i&amp;atfc, we should have an enquiry by a Committee representative of employers and workers and others interested.   I do not want to hold this enquiry until the autumn.An investigation of the nature mentioned, ought to be carefully made, without bias or undue hurry.   This would not be possible at the present moment.     Again, the reform of the Poor Law and the future of unemployment insurance are interconnected.   It would therefore be premature to consider the latter until about the same time that the former is ready to take shape.     Within the last two or three days the Press has been urging an enquiry.     Lastly it is desirable that the Committee should consider the position with their minds directed to the spring and summer of next year.   The present moment is critical for four of our greatest Industries and no one can foretell at this moment the turn events may take.   In the autumn it may be possible to do so.   It will be remembered that it Is only with an improvement in trade that we can hope to get any large numbers off the register.     The result therefore, of any enquiry made ju3t at this moment is almost certain to be disappointing.   While It has been assumed that this enquiry would be immediate, the/positive
positive statement of an enquiry in the autumn would satisfy opinion.     If, therefore, my colleagues agree, I propose on Thursday to make an announcement In the House to the effect that a Committee of Enquiry will be set up in the autumn.(Intd. )   A,S, - M,Ministry of Labour. May 11th 1925.
APPENDIX. RATES    OP   UNEMPLOYMENT   BENEFIT.prior to the Aot of last August, the rates of benefit were 15/- for men and 12/- for women, plus 5/- for a wife and l/- for each dependent child.   The Aot of last August Increased the rates of benefit by 3/- for men and for womenj   making the figures IB/- and 15/- respectively.     It also increased the weekly allowanoe for a child from l/- to 2/-,As to the rates for   men and women,  the rates under the Unemployment Insurance Aot of 1920 - which plaoed the Unemployment insurance Soheme c-n a national basis - were 15/-for men and 12/- for women.     They continued at this rate until March, 1921, when they were raised to 20/- and 16/-respeotively, no allowances for dependants being then payable, in July, 1921, when the oost-of-living figure was 119 (as oompared with the present figure of 75) the rates were reduced to 15/- and 18/- again.     The dependants&apos; allowances were added In October, 1921.     These rates remained in force until August of last year, when (the ooat-of-living figure being 71) they were raised to the present rates of 18/- and 15/- respectively.The arguments in favour of reduction may be briefly stated as follows:-   Payments of rates of IP-/- and 15/-respeotively to single men and women and of 29/- a week to a man, wife and 3 children reduce the incentive to obtaining employment.     Further the fact that relatively high rates of unemployment benefit are payable tends to some extent to diminish the incentive to aooept reductions of wages, which, if arranged, would do something to bring about lower oosts of production.   These considerations (combined with the need to effect eoonomiee) point to the desirability of restoring the rates to the level at which they stood prior to last August./On
On the other hand, a rate of 29/- to a man with a wife and three children is in itself none too high.   The object therefore of good administration should be to exclude the undeserving altogether:   not to out down the rate to tho deserving.     Again the grant of the additional 3/-, oombined with the inoreased allowance for children, was followed by a fall in Poor Law expenditure;    a reduction in the grant will probably be followed by increased payments by Poor Law Authorities.     It may be that it is desirable not to make any change in the rates of unemployment benefit, at least until there has been the enquiry into the unemployment insurance scheme generally, which it is proposed to set up in the autumn of this year.As to the finance of this proposal, a reduction of 3/-in the main rates of   benefit would be a saving (on a live register of 1,300,000) of about  7,000,000 per annum.    Such a saving would, of course, materially help the Unemployment Fundj   but taken by itself it would result in a surplus of only  5,000*000 or thereabouts, In the next 12 months, whereas the debt to be extinguished is  7,500,000. Aooordingly, it must not be inferred that a reduction in expenditure of this amount in the course of the next 12 months would mean that the end of the deficiency would then be reached,    it would, of course aocelerate that much-desired day, but other oonsiderations govern the question -the main one being-   the number unemployed and drawing benefit.
