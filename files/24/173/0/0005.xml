WIDOWS&apos;. ORPHANS&apos; AND OLD AGE CONTRIBUTORY PENSION? FINANCIAL SUMMARY.Table I of the following statement shows for a series of years the estimated expenditure in benefits (other than expenditure arising out of the extension of Old Age Pensions at 70), the estimated receipts from contributions and the difference between these two sums representing the net expenditure.     It will be observed that for the last three months of the year 1925-26 and for the two following years the contributions are in excess of the benefits, this being attributable to the fact that the pensions at 65 do not begin until January, 1928.     It is proposed to apply these surpluses to meet the expenditure of the following years, and to provide in respect of the balance of such expenditure up to the year 1935-36 an equal annual charge upon the Exchequer of  4 millions for the 10 years 1926-27 - 1935-36.In Table II this charge is shown for each of the 10 years in question together with the estimated amount of the additional coat of Old Age Pensions due to the proposals in the Bill with the set-off resulting from the relief in respect of the State contribution to Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance, the net Exchequer charge being accordingly shown in the final column.In Table III the charges on the Exchequer arising under the Bill are set out in conjunction with the charges for Old Age Pensions and War Pensions, the final column showing the total in respect of all three services for each of the years indicated.
