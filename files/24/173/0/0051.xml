CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;?, Government 1Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1925.SECRET.- soCP. 249 (25).CABINET.SPECIAL KEPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 116.    April 1925.THE number of persons on the Registers of Employment Exchanges at the end of April was 1,187,068, a decrease of 7,245 since the end of March. There were rather marked fluctuations of the figures during the period under review and the upward tendency of the figures during the middle of the month was caused largely by extended holidays at Easter and, to a certain extent, by the registering of juveniles at the end of the school term.The net decrease was chiefly due to employment of a seasonal nature. Apart from the activity shown in the building trade, no general improvement in industry was manifest. Considerable activity was shown in painting and decorating work and the motor engineering trade continued to maintain the improvement previously reported. The coal-mining, iron and steel, and shipbuilding industries showed no signs of immediate improvement.A. STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,May 26, 1925.(A.)

COAL MINING.Employment in this industry has not improved; in fact, the position is slightly worse than at the date of the previous Report. Unemployment or short time or accumulating stocks was reported from most of the important areas, with the exception of certain parts of Staffordshire and Kent, where employment was described as good. The depression and resulting unemployment is particularly acute in Scotland and in Wales (Monmouth).IRON AND STEEL.Employment is bad in this industry. In the North-Eastern area work is proceeding on a day to day basis. Further furnaces were closed down on the Tees. Unemployment is particularly heavy, in the Midlands area and in Scotland. At Coatbridge only four out of thirty-four furnaces were in blast, and increased short time was enforced in Motherwell.&apos;TIN-PLATE TRADE.There was no change from the position reported last month and no improvement was shown. Trade was fairly good at Port Talbot, Pontypool and Chepstow, but at Morriston working hours were irregular. A slight improvement took place at Neath, but the previous improvement reported at Swansea was not maintained.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.In shipbuilding employment remained very bad during the month, but there was a slight improvement in ship-repairing work in some centres. On the North-East Coast, an improvement was shown in the ship-repairing branch on the Tyne, but the depression on the Tees and the Wear extended. At Grimsby some additional employment was afforded on the repair of trawlers. No improvement was, however, shown in shipbuilding in the North-Eastern area. At Barrow employment improved, and men were actively engaged in construction and completion of large vessels. In the South-Western Counties there was hardly any repair work at Avon-mouth and the position still remained unsatisfactory at Bristol. Discharges at Cowes were avoided by further orders being received, while yacht builders at Gosport were busy. There was a slight improvement at Woolston and the shipyards were slightly busier at Southampton. In Scotland contracts for two new Australian cruisers were placed on the Clyde and preliminary work was commenced. Other-wise, the work on hand, particularly on the Clydeside, is rapidly nearing completion. In South Wales there was considerable improvement in ship-repairing work.ENGINEERING.Motor Cycle and Aircraft Engineering. Employment remained good in this branch of the industry and general activity was shown, especially at Birmingham and Selly Oak. The position at Sparkhill was not so good, but an improvement took place at Wolverhampton. Trade slackened at Nottingham, but employment remained steady at Coventry, Derby and Redditch. In the pedal cycle section, trade was much below normal for the period of the year. At Oxford conditions remained good, while considerable activity was shown in the Leyland area.General Engineering. No material development took place in this industry and there was little change in the position. In the North-Eastern Counties there was a decline in activity. Short-time working was introduced by the London and North-Eastern Railway Company at Darlington, Doncaster and York engineering, carriage and wagon shops. Some short-time working was also resorted to by Lincoln firms, while further discharges took place at Stockton-on-Tees. The depression in marine engineering was still unrelieved, but in the constructional branch firms were generally well employed and employment in the Sheffield district with makers of agricultural tools was good, but the demand for machine tools showed some falling off. Makers of textile machinery were generally quiet. In the North-Western Counties trade was slack in most districts in the general engineering and iron-founding sections. The electrical trades were well employed, as also were the locomotive works. Railway engineering works were engaged on full-time employ-ment, except at Gorton (London and North-Eastern Railway). In the Midlands area a steady though slight improvement was generally shown.  At Basford, Derby,
Nottingham, Stafford, Wednesbury and West Bromwich, employment was only fair and was slack at Brierley Hill and Smethwick. The improvement was maintained at Aston, Birmingham, Beeston, Chesterfield, Coalville, Newark, Rugby, Stamford and Sutton-in-Ashfield, and trade was good at all of these Centres. Employment in wagon-building continued good at all Centres. In the South-Eastern Counties the position remained steady, with a tendency to improvement. Employment in the provinces was fairly good and trade in London was steady, with the exception of Woolwich, which showed some slackness, particularly on the electrical side. In the South-Western Counties there was an improvement at Bath, but the position was slightly worse at Gloucester and Stroud. No change took place at Bristol and Reading. There wTas less employment in agricultural machinery at Banbury. In Scotland there were no general signs of improvement. At Aberdeen an increase in employment was effected on the overhauling of trawlers. Contracts have been placed in Glasgow for 100 new locomotives for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company.   In South Wales trade was quiet, but employment was reported as fair.TEXTILES.Cotton. Practically no change took place in this branch of the textile industry. Employment in American cotton-spinning districts remained about the same as last month, but there was an increase in unemployment in the fine cotton spinning centres. Very few weavers were totally unemployed. There was no change in the bleaching, dyeing and finishing sections, and short-time working continued in most districts. In the Yorkshire districts there was a slight set-back, but conditions remained fairly satisfactory.Woollens and Worsteds. Employment in this section showed a further decline, and short-time working increased. At Bradford it was reported that nearly one-half of the wool-combing machinery was idle. There was no improvement at Huddersfield, while the heavy woollen trade at Dewsbury was slack. In wool and tweed spinning in Scotland the slackness became more pronounced, and increased short-time working was in operation at Ayr, Kilmarnock and Galashiels.Hosiery. Trade became more depressed in hosiery and unemployment was still heavy. At Basford and Burton-on-Trent trade was quiet, and at Leicester, Mansfield and Nottingham was bad, but a slight improvement was shown at Long Eaton. At Rugby trade continued steady, but short time was prevalent at Sutton-in-Ashfield and the position became worse at Ilkeston. In Scotland there was a slight improvement at Falkirk and Kilmarnock, but slackness continued at Stirling, Hamilton and Wishaw.Lace. Unemployment remained heavy in this branch and trade was generally bad, particularly in the levers&apos; section. Employment was bad at Basford, Ilkeston, Long Eaton, Newark and Nottingham (except in the curtain section), but there was a slight improvement at Beeston. In the South-Western district no improvement took place at Exeter, where short time was still being worked, but there was a slight improvement at Chard and Ilminster.Silk.- Little change took place in this branch, and in the Midlands area there was a slight falling off in trade. At Derby, the artificial silk trade was good and there was a slight improvement at Cheadle (Longton). Trade was quiet at Leicester and a considerable falling off took place at Leek, where short time was introduced at most mills. No improvement was shown at Macclesfield, except in the making-up section. At Braintree there was a slight depression, but silk weaving improved at Letchworth. In the artificial silk trade in Wales employment was good and trade brisk.Jute. Employment remained good at Dundee, Arbroath and Kirriemuir.BUILDING. BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.Considerable activity was shown in this industry, chiefly of - a seasonal nature, and employment continued good generally. There was a brisk demand for painters, bricklayers, plasterers and masons in most districts. Employment in the building and red-brick trade continued good, while the fire-brick industry at Stamford and Stourbridge was fairly good.   Tile making continued to provide steady emplojnnent.
CLOTHING.Continued improvement was shown both in the wholesale and retail sections In the West End employment in dressmaking and wholesale tailoring (both ladies and gents) was good, and there was the usual seasonal demand for experienced hands and machinists. In the East End tailoring continued busy, particularly in ladies work. i In Leeds much short time was being worked, while in the North-Western Counties a large number of tailoresses were still unemployed. The corset industry showed some improvement at Eastville, Kingswood and Derby, but short time was still worked at Hackney and Rugby. The shirt and collar trade was busy at Bermondsey, Woolwich and Yeovil, but short time was being worked at Taunton. In the glove industry the position continued unsatisfactory at Worcester, where much short time was being worked, but there was a slight improvement at Barnstaple and Yeovil.BOOT AND SHOE.This industry showed a slight decline, and employment was not quite so good. Trade was only moderate at Bromsgrove and Wolverhampton, and employment was poor at Wellingboro&apos;, Kettering, Northampton and Leicester. Full time was, however, being worked at Stafford. In London trade was fairly steady with slight improvement at Stepney but some depression at Hackney. Trade in the light dress or &quot; turnshoe &quot; at Norwich showed a falling off. There was an improvement in the slipper trade in the Rossendale Valley. In the South-Western Counties short time was still being worked at Kingswood, while in Scotland a factory was closed at Ayr and discharges took place at Aberdeen.POTTERY.Unemployment in this industry remained heavy, but showed a slight improve-ment towards the end of the month. Trade continued good at Basford and Derby, with a slight improvement at Burslern, Longton and Newcastle-under-Lyme. At Hanley trade was good in the sanitary, tile and fire-clay sections, but much short-time working prevailed in the earthenware section. At Stoke-dn-Trent trade in earthenware and medium-class china sections was not so good, but continued very good in the first-class china section.   The position was satisfactory at Worcester.DOCKS.Employment showed little change from the past month and was generally slack at most ports but was fairly good in the London clocks. An improvement was reported at Bermondsey, Hull and Great Yarmouth. The position at Middlesbrough became worse. There was little change on the Merseyside, and unemployment increased at the Manchester docks and other smaller ports due to the falling off in export trade. At Bristol docks some improvement took place, but large numbers of registered dockers were still unemployed. In Wales the position was generally unsatisfactory. Work at Swansea docks, which was good prior to Easter, was not maintained. A slight improvement at Bute docks, Cardiff, took place due to the commencement of the pit-wood season, but there was an appreciable decline in general cargo trade.
III. work INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24))]The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. -The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes out in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of C-ompilation.-The figures for the Road and assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned.It should be noted that in view of recent modifications in the scope of the table the figures given cannot properly be compared with those previously announced in Parliament in similar connections. The figures given for April 1924, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.Bridge Schemes assisted by the of certain road the Ministry of Exchanges  fromWorks assisted by-Number cf Men employed at-Apr. 25, 1925.Mar. 28, 1925.Apr. 25.1924.1.

IV. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have beenDagreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment and should not be so regarded. It should be borne in mind that the excess of the total outward over the total inward movement from this country is somewhat less than 100,000 a year, and therefore small in comparison with the natural increase of population which for many years before and after the war has not been much less than 400,000 a year.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the month of March (with the corresponding figures for March of last year) and for the twelve months ended the 31st March, 1925 and 1924 respectively, are set out in the following Table : Monthly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The empire settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.

The Scheme, however, closed to new applications in December 1922.
These Statistical Tables have been compiled with a view to showing the extent of the effort from public sources since the Armistice to meet the problems of Post-War Resettlement and Unemployment, and to indicate the measure of assistance provided by the Exchequer. With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to Avhich the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

Estimate of Benefit payable from Armistice to March 31, 1926,  240,000,000.i  j -Unemployment Insurance. (Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Eund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924 the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 155. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to May 2, 1925.Expenditure                     Benefit paid         ....          .... .... 202,714,000Appropriation for Administration .... 19,010,000Section 9 Unemployment InsuranceAct (No. 2), 1924        .... .... 1,263,000Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;o. ....          .... .... 2,753,000

Ministry of Transport Schemes.if, Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Porces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund. 1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923,Payments during Year..

Table 4. Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, of small holdings and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and \b) through the agency of County Councils - and Councils of County Boroughs.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been &quot;reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements-Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement.(A.) England and Wales.
