(faie do cum CRET.p. 265(25)ent is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s government cabinet..Re INSPECTOR SYME,Memorandum by the Home Secretary.-5 0,:y colleagues will remember that some six months ago Syme was bound over at Bow Street and that subsequently he was transferred from prison to Broadmoor Asylum.The six months is now up and Syme can no longer be kept there. He has in fact  just been transferred to a County asylum as a pauper lunatic and of course it is open to the medical attendants there to discharge him at any time  if they are able to certify that he is no longer a lunatic,  and all the trouble from which the King and others have been recently preserved will begin over again.Mr, Charles Trevelyan and Mr.  Smillie,  on behalf of the Labour Party, have had several interviews with me with a view to seeing whether we would be prepared to grant Syme a small pension, payable of course only during good behaviour.I realise the great difficulty of compromising with what might be called crime and it is  certain that it could only be done at a moment like the present when Syme has served his sentence and is quiescent.    There is undoubtedly a feeling that Syme has been at&apos;some time or another treated not perhaps harshly but without that tact which, had it been applied to the case in its earlier stages, might (or might not) have saved all the trouble.    My predecessor, Mr, Churchill, when at the Home Office did make an ineffectual effort to come to terms with Syme.The late Government appointed a Committee of Judges &quot;to examineiithe circumstances connected with the dismissal of Inspector JohniiSyme to report whether wrong was done to that officer and if it was to indicate the measure of the redress due in equity to him&quot;.    The Committee reported that wrong had not been done to Syme,  but they did undoubtedly make  some  statements in the body of their Report
which Syne relies upon as intimating that their sympathies were with him.The following are extracts from this Report -&quot;Though the manner in which the affair of the transfer was handled was far from judicious^  what was actually done was merely to remove Mr.  Syme from one Sub-Division to another with no reduction of pay or rank and in a form Which showed that the transfer was not a punishment.    It is admitted that this was a matter within the absolute discretion of the Assistant Commissioner. Xn/our opinion it is impossible to say that by this wrong was done to Mr.  Syme for which he  could claim compensation.&quot;&quot;We are not unaware that the events into which we have enquired have had an unhappy sequelc    We wish therefore to add that Mr.  Syme presented his case before us not only with great ability but with perfect propriety and temper.&quot;There is, further, the question of hunger-striking.    Syme has had several bouts of this,  which in his case also included thirst-striking.    But when he had to be taken away to Broadmoor I wrote him a personal letter intimating that I had no power to let him out of Broadmoor under what is known as the  Cat and Mouse Act and therefore that he would continue hunger-striking at his own peril.    He accordingly took his food.    If on the other hand he is sent to prison we shall again have hunger-strikes,  and I shall be compelled to let him out under the Act,  which I am personally most averse to doing.My own inclination is,  if possible,  to pay him a small pension. 1 understand that my predecessor was anxious to take this course but was advised - I have no doubt rightly - that he could not do so without obtaining special legislative authority.    The position is the same today except for one important consideration.    Syme has  just been pronounced insane by a remarkable consensus of medical opinion and there is evidence that the  condition from which he is now found to be suffering has been developing during a long period of years.    1 think it might be just possible to hold that the actions in respect of which Syme was dismissed were the result of a state of mind which even at that date constituted &quot;unfitness for further service&quot; in the medical sense,    if that view could be taken it would not be wholly unprecedented to give Syme the benefit of it retrospectively and to treat him as having been retired medically unfit at the  date when he Was in fact dismissed.    There has been,  I am told,  at least one
W.  J. H.May,  1925.G43-5.previous case in the Metropolitan Police of belated diagnosis in which a dismissal was converted into a retirement after some years and search might disclose others.    If this view &quot;could now be taken of Syme&apos;s case he would be eligible for a pension of roughly  47 per annum, and as it would be payable from January,  1910,  there would be an accumulation amounting,  without interest,   to  73?.It must be borne  in mind that Syme has always claimed &quot;full reinstatement&quot;, meaning presumably formal restoration to the rank of inspector and immediate retirement with pension calculated as if he had served continuously to the present date.    He also claimed before the Talbot Committee a large sum in the name of damages but that I think may for present purposes be ignored.    It is open to question whether Syme, who has always shown himself stoically uncompromising, would be willing now to accept a pension falling so far short of his former demand and justified moreover,  not on the ground, for which he haB always contended,  that he was right and the authorities wrong,  but on the singularly unpalatable ground (which would have to be stated publicly) that he was all the time suffering from mental disorder.    He refused a much better offer from Mr. Churchill and unless his resolution has weakened,  of which there is little or no sign, he would refuse this.    It may nevertheless be worth trying.    Something would depend on the attitude taken up by his friends when they had grasped the proposal with all its implications.The matter is one in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is entitled to have a voice,  and I shall be glad if it could be considered by my colleagues.
