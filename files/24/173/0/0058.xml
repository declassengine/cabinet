vS*3C3?.fetiof Btbifid for Foreign Affairs   &apos;   i  .....   .[This Document is the Property of Hfe Britannic Majesty^s Government ] &quot;--- ;---   677GERMANY. CONFIDENTIAL[C 6708/459/18][May 18, 1925.]Section 4.No. 1.Translation of Memorandum communicated informally by the French Embassy on May 18 in reply to certain Enquiries which Mr. Austen Chamberlain made of the French Ambassador on May 14 when the latter handed to him the French Draft Note to Germany on the Subject of Security.(For French text, see &quot;Germany &quot; Print, May 18, Section 1.   Paragraphs numbered I, II, &amp;c, in Foreign Office for convenience of reference.)$0Draft Reply to the German Note.Observations made by Mr. Austen Replies.Chamberlain.I. Paragraph 1, last sentence :Is it understood that the entry of Germany into the League of Nations is an essential but not a prior condition of the agreements contemplated ?II. Paragraph 4, the sentence : &quot; The treaties of arbitration should not leave room for coercive action save in case of failure to observe the provisions of the various treaties and agreements contem-plated in the present note.&quot;This sentence might be interpreted as excluding the peace treaties from the arbitration to be set up. This would be excessive. Arbitration must not be used to revise the treaties, but may be em-ployed to solve disputes raised by the execution of the said treaties.III. Paragraph 5 : Austria.IV. Paragraph 5 : Poland.V. Paragraph 5, last sentence, and para-graph 6 taken together appear to give the same guarantee to the eastern as to the western frontiers of Germany.[950 s-4]Yes.   It will perhaps be necessary to -provide that the pact shall lapse in the event of Germany delaying her entry into the League of Nations after the signature of the said pact.Arbitration applies to the peace treaties, subject expressly to their special stipula-tions for the application of certain clauses. For instance : Articles of the Treaty of Versailles vesting in the Allied Powers the direct control of the execution of certain clauses (e.g., military control) ; articles of the treaty (42-44) characterising breaches of certain of its provisions as hostile acts or (429) giving to the Allied Powers the right to take certain decisions.M. Briand thinks that the text of his note covers the Austrian question. He cannot reply in the name of Austria, because he is replying only in agreement with his allies, of whom Austria is not one.The text of the draft has not been drawn up in concert with the Polish Government, who will be informed of it later.M. Briand does not wish to confer the same guarantees on the eastern as on the western frontiers of Germany.The settlement on the western frontiers of Germany would comprise both 1. A special territorial guarantee, and 2. A general guarantee constituted bythe mutual engagement not to go to warand by the arbitration treaties.The settlement on the eastern frontiers would only comprise the second guarantee.
Observations made by Mr. Austen Chamberlain.VI.....Replies.As regards the western frontiers and the territorial settlement on the Rhine, the special guarantee which Great Britain would give would result from the territorial nature of the settlement and from the description in the Treaty of Versailles of the, violation of the said settlement as a hostile act.As regards, the eastern frontiers, the guarantee which Great Britain would give would he chiefly moral, since it would apply to arbitration treaties.
