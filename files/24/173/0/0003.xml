SECRET. Copy No.     u bCP. 203 (25).CABINET.SIE HUGH LANE&apos;S PICTURES.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Unber-Secretary of State for theColonies.I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet the Report of the Committee appointed to enquire into certain questions relating to the late Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s bequest to the National Gallery, together with a covering note prepared by the Secretary of State for the Colonies before his departure abroad. This memorandum (together with the report) was sent to Lord Curzon on the 24th February shortly before his illness as Mr. Amery desired to have his views upon it before submitting it to his colleagues. Unfortunately, however, Lord Curzon was unable to reply.W. O. G.Colonial Office, April 1925.With reference to CP. 40 (24), 14th Conclusion, I circulate to my colleagues the Report of the Committtee appointed by my predecessor to enquire into certain questions relating to the bequest by the late Sir Hugh Lane of thirty-nine pictures to the National Gallery, London.It will be remembered that the fate of these pictures has on frequent occasions aroused interest in both Houses of Parliament, and I am of opinion, therefore, that it will be desirable eventually to lay the Report before Parliament. As, however, the appointment of the Committee was largely due to a personal letter from Mr. Cosgrave to my predecessor, I should propose, in the first instance, to send a copy of the Report confidentially to Mr. Cosgrave, informing him that it is proposed to publish it, and asking for his views as to the date of publication.I think it will also be necessary, before publishing the Report, to consider further the proposal contained in paragraph 13. In his letter to Mr. Thomas of the 1st May, 1924, Mr. Cosgrave said : &quot; I understand that there would be no great opposition on the part of the National Gallery to giving the pictures to the City of Dublin by way of a perpetual loan.&quot; I do not know whether a perpetual loan is contemplated by paragraph 13 of the Report; and, in any case, that paragraph only suggests the loan of some of the thirty-nine pictures. Before any legislation of the kind suggested is introduced, it will be necessary to secure the assent of the Trustees of the National Gallery, and it would be desirable at the same time to ascertain from them how far they are prepared to go, after the passage of such legislation, to meet the wishes of the City of Dublin. For this purpose I should be glad if Lord Curzon could be authorised to bring the matter confidentially before his fellow Trustees.L. S. A.February 22, 1925.[12961]b[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1925.
Sir Hugh La.ne&apos;s Pictures.To the Right hon L. S. Amery, M.P.,Secretary of State for the Colonies.Sir,1. We were appointed by your predecessor, the Right Hon. J. H. Thomas, M.P., in pursuance of a Cabinet decision of the 9th July, 1924, as a Committee to consider certain questions relating to the thirty-nine pictures bequeathed under the Will of the late Sir Hugh Lane to the^ National Gallery in London. The terms of our reference,were as follows : To consider the arguments advanced by the Irish Free State and the Trustees of the National Gallery in London, and to report whether, in our opinion (i.) Sir Hugh Lane, when he signed the codicil of the 3rd February, 1915,thought that he was making a legal disposition, (ii.) If so, whether it is proper that, in view of the international character of the matter at issue, the legal..defject in the codicil should be remedied by legislation.&apos; 2. Written statements have been submitted to us by the Trustees of the London National Gallery and the Dublin Corporation, and we have had the additional advantage of oral testimony by representatives of each of those bodies, and of other parties interested. We have, indeed, received every assistance from all concerned in the dispute. After full consideration of all the evidence laid before us, we have the honour to submit our Report.3. The following chronological outline briefly summarises the main facts of the case which are beyond dispute : The late Sir Hugh Lane, an Irishman by birth, and an expert in art matters, founded in 1907 a Gallery of Modern Painting in Dublin, some of the pictures being presented by himself, and others by those whose interest in the project he aroused.In July 1913 Lane informed the Director of the National Gallery, London, in a letter that, as the Dublin Corporation were reluctant to carry out his conditions as to building a permanent Gallery to house the Collection, he had decided to offer as a temporary loan to the National Gallery a group of thirty nine pictures which at that time were on exhibition in Dublin. In August 1913 this offer was accepted; and at the end of September 1913 Lane withdrew the thirty-nine pictures from Dublin and deposited them with the London National Gallery.On the 3rd October, 1913, Lane executed a Will, bequeathing the thirty-nine pictures to the London National Gallery, &quot; to found, a collection of modern continental art in London.&quot; The relevant portion of the will is appended to this Report (Appendix (A)).In March 1914 Lane was appointed Director of the Dublin National Gallery.Early in 1915 he contemplated making an immediate journey to the United States. On the 3rd February, 1915, he drew up and signed a codicil to his will, bequeathing the thirty-nine pictures to the City of Dublin. The text of this codicil will be found in Appendix (B).  His signature was not witnessed.Lane&apos;s departure for the United States was unexpectedly delayed, and he did not sail until the 8th April. On the 7th May he was drowned when returning on board the &quot; Lusitania.&quot;4. Of the two questions addressed to us, we have found that the former presents the greater difficulty in arriving at an unqualified and unanimous reply. To answer it has involved us in the endeavour to reconstruct the mind and thoughts of a man, long since dead, on a particular occasion nearly ten years ago, with no material for our guidance beyond the imperfect and not infrequently contradictory record of his words and actions during the period immediately adjacent to the date in question.5. We have inspected the original of the Codicil, and the envelope in which it was enclosed by Lane. It is carefully written in ink on a double sheet of the official notepaper of the National Gallery of Ireland. A correction in the date at the head of the document bears the marginal authentication &quot;H. Lane.&quot; The envelope was securelv fastened, and addressed (in Lane&apos;s writing) to his sister, who was his confidante in matters of personal business, and the Custodian of his Will. The document was deposited in the drawer of the desk which Lane used as Director of the Dublin National Gallery.
6. The unusual care with which Lane drew up the Codicil, and the precautions he took to ensure its falling into the right hands in the event of his decease, leave little room for doubt that it was no mere draft or memorandum for his own use, but a document to which at the time of signature he attached the greatest importance. The fact that he appears to have mentioned its existence to no one disposes of the conjecture that his object in drawing it up was merely to satisfy the wishes of his Irish friends and relatives. His omission to secure witnesses to his signature is in no way inconsistent with the general impression which we have formed of his mental habits and temperament; and in this connection we would draw attention to the statement made to us by his sister that, although on the occasion of his making an earlier will she had explained to him the need for witnesses, he had proposed to sign the will of the 3rd October, 1913 (which she had written out for him), without witnesses, and had again to be reminded of the necessity.7. In the absence of any conceivable alternative purpose for which Lane might have intended the document to which he attached such importance, we are led to the conclusion that at the time of signature he thought he was making a legal disposition, which should take effect in the event of his not returning alive from the dangerous voyage which he had immediately in contemplation. The reply, therefore, to the first part of our enquiry is in the affirmative; we shall discuss later the degree of relevance borne by this conclusion to our recommendation under the second head.8. The views of your Committee on this subject, however, are not unanimous. One of our number desires it to be placed on record that he feels unable to associate himself with the unqualified reply of his colleagues, as expressed in the two preceding paragraphs.9. Our observations on the second of the questions referred to us may con-veniently be divided into three parts. We shall first consider the strictly legal aspect of the question, and formulate our view as to the relation of the problem to the law and practice regarding testamentary dispositions in general. Next, we shall discuss the extent to which legalisation of the codicil would in fact be in accordance with the spirit of Lane&apos;s intentions, in so far as we have been able to divine them. Finally, we propose to deal with the question from the more general point of view, bearing in mind that it has been referred to us as a matter of international character.10. No case has been brought to our notice, nor have our own enquiries revealed an example, in which a legal defect in a will or codicil has been removed by a public Act of Parliament in the public interest in order to give effect to what is alleged to have been the true intention of the Testator. It is a salutary and long-recognised principle that, in giving effect to the wishes of the dead, regard should be paid only to the legal expression of those wishes, and that evidence of contrary intention, either dependent upon extraneous testimony or recorded in a manner not recognised by law, should be allowed no credence. Validation by Act of Parliament of Lane&apos;s imperfect codicil would, we are advised, constitute a legal precedent of first importance; and recourse to such a step would be justified only in the presence of an overwhelmingly strong case on grounds of general public interest.The principle is generally admitted that it is inequitable so to redress a moral wrong as to impair a moral right. It has been represented to us that, even though it should be conceded that the Dublin Corporation has a moral claim to the pictures denied to them by a legal flaw, yet now to make good that flaw would amount to inflicting upon the London National Gallery an injury comparable with that which it is sought to alleviate. Not only has the London Gallery the legal possession of the pictures, but on the assurance that such possession would be in perpetuity it has secured the gift of a Gallery in which the pictures are to be housed. To stultify the assurance on the strength of which the gift was offered would be a breach of faith with the donor.11. We have expressed the view, held by the majority of our number, that at the moment of signing the codicil, Lane thought he was making a legal disposition; or, in other words, that on the 3rd February, 1915, it was Lane&apos;s definite intention that, in the event of his death during his absence from Europe, the thirty-nine pictures should take their place with the rest of his collection in Dublin. We propose now to review, briefly, our reasons for considering that to give effect to that intention by Act of Parliament would be contrary to the spirit and purport of Lane&apos;s wishes, as expressed during the last two years of his life, in regard to the ultimate destination of his bequest.Nothing stands out more clearly from the record of Lane&apos;s acts and conversations during the years 1913-15 than the instability of his attitude towards the rival [12961] b 2
claims of the Dublin and the London Gallery. The friction in which he found himself unfortunately involved with the authorities of either institution in turn bent his thoughts now to London, now to Dublin, as the possible recipient of his gift. A mood of annoyance&apos; with the one or the other caused him to vacillate with a frequency and suddenness which appear remarkable, until it is realised that underlying the rapid and impulsive changes of his attitude there wras one steady purpose ever present to his mind.The establishment, under worthy conditions, of a Gallery of Modern Continental Painting, ultimately perhaps to be comparable with the great modern galleries of the capitals of Europe, was the goal to which Lane&apos;s activities seem constantly to have been directed. Whether this Gallery should be in Dublin or in London was, in our view, a matter to which he was relatively indifferent; a hint that either city was in a position to provide a building commensurate with his idea seemed enough to turn his mind in its favour. In his conversations he was careful to avoid any commit-ment so definite as to hamper his future discretion; even during the period between the signature of the codicil and his departure for America we find that he expressed himself in contrary senses to the one party and the other, making it clear to the dispassionate observer that not until he was finally assured of the prospect of a Gallery did he intend to commit himself irrevocably. The thirty-nine pictures were, in fact, a makeweight which he cast first into one scale, then into the other, according as the indications pointed to London, or to Dublin, as the sphere of realisation of his cherished ideal.Turning now to consider the developments of the last ten years, we find that whereas in Dublin no practical steps have been taken to advance the fulfilment of Lane&apos;s desires, in London there exists, thanks to the munificence of a private benefactor, a Gallery, rapidly approaching completion, destined to serve the very object which Lane had in view. Had he been spared to witness the growth of the new Gallery at Millbank, no doubt can be entertained that he would have destroyed the codicil, and would have been content that the pictures to which he attached so much value would form the nucleus of a representative collection of Modern Continental Art.The plea that effect should be given, by means which we are advised are extra-ordinary and unprecedented, to the momentary wishes of a man, who, if still alive, would probably have been the first to deplore the result, is one which we cannot endorse.12. In our terms of reference we were invited to have particular regard to &quot;the international character of the matter in issue.&quot; We submit, however, that there is nothing in the circumstances attending the subject of our enquiry which justifies its being raised to the status of a bone of contention between nations. The parties directly interested in the controversy are, on the one hand, the municipal authorities of a city, and on the other, the Board of Trustees of an institution which, though National in name, is in fact more of the nature of a semi-public corporation than of a Department of State.13. We are informed that in December 1916 the Trustees of the National Gallery intimated to the representatives of the Dublin Corporation their conditional readiness to respond favourably to any request for the loan of some of the thirty-nine pictures which might reach them from the authorities of the Galleries in Dublin. This offer was repeated in March 1918. We venture so far to depart from the strict terms of our reference as to suggest that on lines such as these lies the best hope of reaching an amicable settlement of this long-drawn controversy.By the National Gallery (Loan) Act of 1883 the Trustees are empowered to lend pictures under their control to any public gallery authorised by the Act. We are advised that the inclusion of Section 5 of this Act in the Schedule to the Irish Free State (Consequential Adaptation of Enactments) Order in Council, 1923, preserves the right of the Municipal Gallery in Dublin to be regarded as an authorised Gallery for this purpose.It is provided, however, by another section ($ 4) of the Act that pictures acquired by gift or bequest shall not be so lent until the expiration of fifteen, or, in certain cases, twenty-five years from the date on which they came into possession of the Gallery, and this condition appears effectually to bar any proposal for an early loan of a portion of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s pictures to the Dublin Gallery. We suggest that a short Act of Parliament might be passed amending this section of the Act of 1883.
Appendix (A).This is the Last Will and Testament of me, Hugh Percy Lane, Kait., of Lindsey House 100 Cheyne Walk Chelsea in the County of Middlesex.   I hereby revoke all Wills heretofore made by me. - .1. . . (Sundry personal bequests) ....vs I bequeath my Sargent portrait to the Dublin National Gallery. I bequeath my.\Sargent portrait, the modern pictures now being shown in Belfast and any modern pictures of merit (John drawings, etc.) that I possess to the. Dublin Gallery of Modern Art, other than the group of pictures lent by me to the London National Gallery, which I bequeath to found a collection of Modern Continental Art in London.I bequeath the remainder of my property to the National Gallery of Ireland (instead of to the Dublin Modern Art Gallery, which I considered so important for the founding of an Irish School of painting), to be invested and the income to be spent on buying pictures of deceased painters of established merit. I hope that this alteration from the Modern Gallery to.the National Gallery will be remembered by the Dublin Municipality and others as an example of its want of public spirit in the^$$ar 1913 and for the folly of such bodies assuming to decide on questions of ^efffcrinstead of relying on expert opinion.&apos;19fS witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 11th day of October, one^ffibusand nine hundred and thirteen.Testator&apos;s signature :&apos; PIUGH PERCY LANE.Signed and Declared by the above-named Testator as and for his last Will in the presence of us present at the same time, who at his request and in his presence and in the presence of each other have hereunto affixed our names as witnesses.Name: Frank Loftus. Address: 100, Cheyne Walk. Occupation: Butler.Name: Cicely Loftus. Address: 100, Cheyne Walk. Occupation: Housekeeper.14. To sum up, we find (subject to the reservation in paragraph 8) : (a) that Sir Hugh Lane, in signing the codicil of the 3rd February, 1915, thought he was making a legal disposition.(&amp;) that nevertheless it would not be proper to modify Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s Will by public Act of Parliament. To do so would, in addition to constituting a legal precedent of the utmost gravity, not justified by the facts, have the effect of bringing about a result contrary to the real spirit of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s intentions. Our reply to the second question is therefore in the negative.15. We have been much assisted by our Secretary, Mr. L. B. Freeston (Colonial Office), in the course of our enquiry, both in keeping the records of our various meetings (without the aid of a shorthand-writer) and in the drafting of this Report, and we desire to record our high appreciation of these services.J. W. WILSON (Chairman). GEORGE H. BARNES. JOHN W. HILLS.L. B. Freeston (Secretary). January 28, 1925.
i. Appendix (B).National Gallery of Ireland.This is a Codicil to my last Will to the effect that the group of pictures now at the London National Gallery which I had bequeathed to that institution I now bequeath to the City of Dublin, providing that a suitable building is provided for them within five years of my death. The group of pictures I have lent to Belfast I give to the Municipal Gallery in Harcourt Street. If a building is provided within five years the whole collection will be housed together. The sole Trustee in this question is to be my Aunt, Lady Gregory. She is to appoint any additional trustees she may think fit.I also wish that the pictures now on loan at this (National Gallery of Ireland) Gallery remain as my gift.(Sd.) HUGH LANE.I would like my friend Tom Bodkin to be asked to help in the obtaining of this new Gallery for Modern Art for Dublin. If within five years a Gallery is not forth-coming, then the group of pictures (at the London National Gallery) are to be sold and the proceeds go to fulfil the purpose of my Will.(Sd.) HUGH LANE.February 3, 1915.
