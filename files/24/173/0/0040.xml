C.P. 238 (25).CABINET.WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF RAILWAYMEN.Present Position of Negotiations.1. IN a previous paper (CP.  138 (25)) the earlier stages of the wage negotiations in the railways industry were described and an account was given ofgeneral machinery for dealing with them.    This   memorandum   describes subsequent developments.2. It will be remembered that the Companies replied to the &quot; all-grades pro-gramme &quot;of the N.U.R. and Railway Clerks&apos; Association by a counter-claim for reductions of 4s. per week in London and 6s. per week in the&apos; provinces for men in the traffic grades. The N.U.R. decided to refer their claim to the Central Wages Board (see CP. 138 (25), $7), but on condition that the Board considered the pro-gramme for all grades. As the railway shopmen and the restaurant car staff are not within the scope of the Central or National Wages Boards, this raised difficulties, and the companies informed the National Union of Railwaymen that, as the majority of the skilled men in the railway workshops were members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and other craft Unions, they were unable to agree to refer the claims affecting shopmen to the Central Wages Board, on which the craft Unions were not represented, and stated that the National Union of Railwaymen should endeavour to come to an agreement with the craft Unions for the setting up of joint machinery for the consideration of questions affecting railway shopmen. For this purpose the companies suggested that a Board similar in character to the Central Wages Board might be set up consisting of representatives of the companies, the National Union of Railwaymen and the craft Unions, and that in cases where the Board could not agree, differences should be referred to the Industrial Court for settlement. The National Union of Railwaymen acted on the suggestion of the companies and invited the craft Unions to a conference to discuss the question of setting up joint negotiating machinery regarding railway shopmen. The present position is that the National Union of Railwaymen are awaiting the replies of the craft Unions to this invitation. In the meantime, the &quot; all-grades programme &quot; is held up.3. Two of the railway companies, namely, the Great Western and the London and North-Eastern, have not, however, marked time. The fall in their revenue, due mainly to the decline in coal exports and the general depression in the coal industry, has led them to consider means of reducing working costs.4. The Great Western Company have too large a staff for the present traffic which they are handling, and they therefore put forward three alternative proposals : (1.) Suspension of the guaranteed day and week. (2.) Dismissals.(3.) Reduction in pay for all grades on a percentage basis.These proposals were submitted on the 6th April, 1925, to the three Sectional Councils for the Traffic Grades (other than locomotive grades), Goods Grades and Locomotive Grades. The two former Councils, which are composed of members of the National Union of Railwaymen, refused, after consultation with the Head Office of the National Union of Railwaymen, to discuss the alternatives (1) and (3), contending that it was outside the functions of the Sectional Councils to consider [13089](Ministry of Labour Industrial Memoranda Serial No. 3.)
proposals which would have the effect of modifying in relation to one company a National Agreement covering all companies.5. It is understood that the men&apos;s representatives on the Locomotive Sectional Council, the majority of whom are members of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, agreed to consider a percentage off wages and were against dismissals.8. The Great Western Company have since been in communication with the Headquarters of the National Union of Railwaymen on the matter, and there have been renewed meetings of the Sectional Councils, at which progress has been made.7. The London and North-Eastern Company have made no direct proposals to the Unions, but they have issued a statement to the effect that the decrease in business, particularly in the shipments of coal, has become so serious that it may no longer be possible to find employment for all the men who become spare, and, with a view to curtailing expenditure in the shops, arrangements have been made to place some of the company&apos;s shopmen on short time, and this practice may have to be extended. For example, they have posted a notice at their Greensfield Locomotive Shops at Gateshead to the effect that on and from the 25th April the works will be closed on Saturday mornings; approximately 2,000 men and boys will be affected by this notice.8. The contention of the National Union of Railwaymen that the Sectional Councils are not competent to consider the questions of the suspension of the guaranteed day and week and the reduction in pay of all grades suggested by the Great Western Company appears to be well founded. The agreement between the railway companies. and the three railway Unions setting up Sectional and other Railway Joint Councils provides that one of the functions of the Sectional Council shall be to deal with the local application of National Agreements, and that the Sectional Council shall not introduce any arrangement inconsistent with the decisions of the Central or National Wages Boards. This contention is borne out by the statement of the London and North-Eastern Company that the present rates are settled by National Agreements, and that the basis of both salaries and wages cannot be altered without negotiations with the Trade Unions concerned in accordance with well-established procedure.9. It is not known how far the companies are likely to press their proposals, but presumably they will proceed to make their arrangements in regard to short-time working and dismissals, and will discuss with the Unions concerned the other questions before taking action. The effect of the action of the companies will certainly be to make it difficult for the National Union of Railwaymen and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association to proceed at the present time with their &quot; all-grades programme &quot; and to strengthen the case of the companies for a reduction in wages.May 1925.
