ifpeport by the Government Actuary on the Financial Provisions of the Bill.WIDOWS&apos;,  ORPHANS&apos;  AND  OLD  AGE CONTRIBUTORY  PENSIONS  BILL,To the Right Hon. Neville Chamberlain, M.P., Minister of Health.Sir,I submit the following Report explaining the financial provisions of the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Bill.1. The benefits provided by the Bill, in consideration of the contributions to be paid, consist of (a.) Pensions at the rate of 10s. a week to insured persons on attaining the age of 65 and to the wives, on attaining age 65, of insured men who are, or have been, pensioned under this provision; the right being granted, in each case, to an Old Age Pension at 70 without the application of the &quot;means test&quot; and other conditions provided by the. existing law.(b.) Pensions at the rate of 10s. a week to the widows of insured men, such pensions being payable to the age of 70, and: attracting the same right to an Old Age Pension without the application of the &quot;means test&quot; or other of the *   present statutory conditions.(c.) Allowances to a widow in respect of children under the age of 14, at the rates of 5s. a week for the eldest of such children and 3s. a week for each other such child.(d.) Allowances in respect of orphan children under the age of 14 at the rates of 7s. 6d. a week for the eldest child of a family and 6s. a week for each, other child.[Note:-Clause 43 of the Bill contains the precise definition of child &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; orphan.&quot;]The contributions to be paid in respect of these benefits are !)(Z. la week for a man and tyd. a week for a woman; in the case of a man Itlie employer and the worker will each pay 4^d.   The employer of a woman will pay 2 d; and the worker 2d.2. It is proposed that insurance shall be compulsory and that it shall cover all persons within the system of National Health Insurance, including, with certain modifications, those employed persons to whom the sfsteiii would normally apply but for the pro-visions of the Health Insurance Act relating to exemptions and&apos; exceptions.[13011Jb

It will be seen from Table I that the number of insured men grows more rapidly than the number of insured women, w;ith the result that in I960 the men are 15 per cent, more numerous than those brought into insurance in 1926, while&apos;the women represent aii increase&apos; of no more than 5 per cent.; it Will also&quot; be observed that while ;th.e number of men continues to increase up to 1960 the number of women diminishes after 1950. The more rapid increase among the insured men as compared with the increase among the insured women up to the year 1950 is mainly attributable to the large number of deaths of insured men in&apos; the Great War. As a result ol this loss the relative numbers of insured men and insured women as1 existing under the Health Insurance system before the War has been disturbed, and a generation will pass away before the pre-wai conditions in this respect are restored. The decrease in the nunibei of insured women after 1950 is attributable to the fact that thi assumptions made as&quot; to the - decline in the birth rate (which an explained in the Appendix) involve an actual decrease in th( numbers entering insurance at the age of 16 from and after th( year 1950. As, to a large extent, the insurance of women ceases oi marriage, a decreasing number of entrants anto insurance result! much more quickly in the case of women than in the case.of jnen i an,,actual decline in the total, numbers insured.
24HHHir.\7 :1 ill.    , ... . .  TofiEiEatb.oeContribution;. ... r5 The relation of the contributions to the benefits is based upon the principle by which the contributions have been determined in (he case of National Health Insurance.   Under that&apos;-&apos;system the contributions&apos; are equal in value (as actuarially ascertained) to the benefits granted to persons entering into insurance at the age of 16, special arrangements being made by which, in effect, the State provides for the extra liability, over and above the provision, made, hv the contributions, arising in respect of persons entering into insurance at all ages between 17 and 70.   In applying this principle to the present case regard has been had to two considerations peculiar to a scheme of. this kind, namely, (i) that the major part of the benefits consists of pensions for widows and allowances for children, and (ii) that the wife of an insured man will be entitled, equally with himself, to a-: pension when both have reached the age of (15.   These considerations suggest that insured women (who for the most part are young and unmarried) should contribute to the scheme on a wider basis than is represented by the slight probability \ that they will themselves, * continue ;in.: insurance to the age of 65, and then become entitled to a pension in their own right.   Ifris&apos; accordingly proposed that for insured women the weekly contribu-tion shall be one-half of the rate payable for insured men. , The effect is that during the period of their employment women (withi their employers) will make a contribution towards-the benefits to which they will be entitled either in their own right or as the wives; and widows of insured men.    In ascertaining the contributions which, under this condition, would collectively provide, the benefits i for persons becoming insured at the age of 16, regard has been had lo the relative numbers of persons of each sex entering into insurance al or about this age, and to the fact that while, in the normal case, I lie contribution in respect of a man will be payable up to the age;, of 65, the woman&apos;s contribution will cease upon her marriage, save in the cases (which are estimated to be about one in seven). in which employment continues after marriage.6. The calculations have been made, so far as interest is con-, revncd, at the rate of 4 per cent., and the life tables employed have been deduced from the death rates prevailing in England and Wales dining the two years 1920 and 1921..* The contributions being, paid at the same times and with those which are payable in respect of Health Insurance will not be due in periods of sickness, and unemployment. The basis of the allowances to be made in respect of these periods is that adopted for the financial arrange-ments under the Health Insurance system. As regards unemploy-ment this basis provides for rather more than ^ weeks annually,, on the average, for each insured person. This is equal to an unemployment rate of 5 per cent., for the whole insured population..I     * The death rates of these years were below the present level and their Jj employment gives such effect as is practicable, without the introduction of I hypothetical methods, to the, probability : that-the general tendency- of thei-I tteath rate in future will be to diminish. i
and lif-i jfecbe-iassvmied: that Hwfci el!asses;&apos;!outside,4;he: iUnempl.oynv.1 Insurance scheme are subject&apos;to1 about one-third; of the unenrnlo. merit to which the classes within that scheme, are liable,:;the ra(( provided for in the case of the latter is G per cent.As will be explained - in a later paragraph, account has been taken of the special conditions of the present time, in regard fo unemployment, when calculating it-he income from contribution expected to be received in the years immediately following flu commencement of the Act.In respect of other factors entering into the calculation.-q the probability that a man dying at any age will leave a widow, or that he will leave dependent, children, extensive use has been made- of data drawn from tbe census, ,care having been taken ts make such adjustments as scrutiny, of these data has indicated fo be necessary to allow for errors -and -omissions, affecting the: census schedules. The statistical&apos;basis;of.the:work is more fullyindicaW in the Appendix.  - . -v;    .7. The contributions which under a scheme depending soldi on.contributions would be required to provide the benefits grany - by the -Bill (exclusive of the new rights in respect - of Old iU Pensions at -70V for persons of different ages at the commenceniml of the: Act are as shown in the following Table. These contribiitii depend upon the relative numbers of insured men and women at the several ages shown and are assumed to be payable until fc attainment of age 65 or in the case of a woman until the of her marriage, if she then ceases to be employed. It shouldki added that these contributions depend upon compulsory insurant! based upon employment. Having regard to the type of benefits provided, the rates would be quite insufficient to support a system of insurance resting on a voluntary basis.Table II.The weekly Contributions at different ages at entry which under a scheme of compulsory insurance are the equivalents of tie Benefits provided by the Bill.Age. when Contributions begin.

C : r. Tl -will be seeii by Table Tl that the rate of contribution appro-pi into to entrants at the age of 16 is 10d.-a week for a man and Sd. a week for a woman. In consideration of the relief to be derived by the &quot;Exchequer from 1928 onwards in respect of the contribution to Unemployment Insurance (see paragraph 31 below), it is proposed by the Bill to fix the joint contribution of the insured person and the employer &amp;t-9d. a week for a man and 4Jd. a week for. a woman, until the end of 1935. The two reductions are not; however, of equal value. The number of persons brought within full insurance under the Bill is abont&apos;3^- millions greater than the number insured against unemployment, and. while under normal conditions of employment the abatement of Id. a week (or&quot; ^d. for a woman) in the contribution required by the Bill represents a charge of about  2,100,000 a year to the Exchequer, the relief to the State Grant lor Unemployment Insurance does not exceed  1,800,000. The concession thus imposes on the Exchequer a net charge amounting at the outset to about  600,000 a year. .9. &quot;For the ten years beginning with 1936,&apos; having regard to the rising cost of the benefits, the Bill provides that, unless Parliament shall otherwise^etermine,.-the contributions shajl be raised from 9d. lo 1 \d. (men)iand from4yi.;,tq o^d. (women). Further additions of id. and Id. respectively are, provided, from 1946 to ,1955, and again from 1956 onwards, ivEronn the latter year the contributions, unless Parliament otherwise, determines,,.will be Is. 3d-, a week in respect of a man and lid. a week, in respect of a woman.;The Capital-Value of,the-Benefits, to the Employed. -;- Contributors1., &quot;10. The value of - the beftefits. conferred by the Bill on. the employed persons coming into&apos; the scheme at the outset (other than the new rights conferred in respect of Old Age &quot;Pensions at 70) i  950,000,000, and. the value of the contributions jointly payable \,(, such employed persons and their employers (including the dec^erfmal additions&apos;described in the last paragraph) is  354,000,000^ The capital value of the liability -for which the State becomes responsible is thus  596,000,000. Against this sum should ,be set the. relief accruing to the Exchequer in respect of the termination from 19-28 onwards of the Health and Unemployment insurance of persons aged over&apos; 65 ; this:Ts. estimated to be worth for the1 present insured population-about  80,000,000. The net liability assumed by the State in respect of persons employed at the commencement of *he Act is thus estimated to be  566,000,000. For&apos;the purpose of the valuation&quot;&apos; it has been assumed that such of the persons included as afterwards leave insurable employment will exercise the right conferred upon them by the Bill to continue in insurance as voluntary contributors.&apos;To the extent to which this right may not be exercised, the liabilities of the Exchequer will be modified and in framing the estimates included in the Tables presented later in this Report, effect has been given to the actual conditions to be expected in this respect, as indicated by the statistical -data&quot; of National Health244

It has been shown (paragraph 7) that the benefits provided to the. age of 70 under the Bill are equal in value to the product of a contribution eompulsorily payable from the age of 16 of lOd. a week-for employed men and 5d. a week for employed women; and in the last paragraph that the application of nine-tenths of these rates of contribution to persons of all ages brought into insurance at the commencement of the&quot; scheme, though coupled with three decennial increases of contribution, applied to the survivors of those persons, will impose a heavy burden upon public funds. There remains for investigation the relation of the benefits to the contributions proposed by the Bill in the case of future entrants. For-this purpose the ease of persons becoming insured at the age of .16, and who naturally constitute a. very, large, majority of all who enter insurance, will be taken. The, effect, of the arrangement proposed, as described in paragraphs 8 and 9 is-as follows : For entrants at 16 in the year 1926, the ^contribution will be-. 9d. for a man and A\d. for a woman till 1985-.; .     , : -.  lid. for a man and 5$d. for a&apos;woman .from 1,986 till 1945 :Is.&apos; Id. for a man and 6^d. for a-woman from J.9.46 till 1955; &apos;    Is. 3d. for a man and-7lrd. for a woman from 1956 till 1975, when the age of 65 will, be reached and contributions ;&apos; will cease.       -.: , ,,  ,       ,  i -   &apos;,,        * -  .For entrants at 16 in the. year.-1986,the.contributions will begin at Aid. and 5$d., moving up by stages in 1946 and 1956 to the inaxima of Is. Sd. and 7jd. For entrants at 16 in the year .194(5 the contributions will begin at Is. Id. and 6&apos;jdL&apos;, and after, tern years will become Is. Sd. and 7$d. For entrants at 16 in the year 1956 and afterwards the contributions will be Is. 8a. and l\d. and will not be increased beyond these sums. It is to be observed in, connection with&apos; these arrangements that the Old Age Pension at 70- -is, under the Bill, to . be .payable to all insured persons and . in the ease of men, to their wivesarid widows without reference to. means or other of the present statutory conditions, thus raising the question: of , the provision to be niad,e for. the cost of Old Age Pensions in the future.&apos; The effect ofj the:. decennial increases Of contribution is to place upon the contribution, paid for future entrants into insurance at the age of 16; the whole cost of the benefits up to the age of 70 conferred upon them and their dependants by the new scheme and a proportion of the cost of the Old Age Pensions to which they will become entitled at 70. Thus the contributions payable for entrants at 16 in the year 1926 (inclusive of the decennial increases) in addition to providing for the new benefits to the age of 70 will provide for 21 per cent, of the Old Age Pensions to which they, and in the case of men, their wives and widows, will be entitled. For entrants at 16 in the year 1936, 55 per cent, of,the Old Age Pensions, will be. similarly..purchased.For--;entrants- in the year
on1&apos;&apos;tbi:tile&apos;i contributory&apos;&apos;&apos;Bas&apos;i&apos;s, While&quot;in &quot;the case !6f&apos;;personS1 who; enter into insurance in the year 1956 and afterwards the Whole ,.ost of the Old Age Pensions will be provided by the contribution. For entrants at 16 in intermediate years to those quoted,&quot; the percentages -will be proportionately varied. For entrants at higher ages the percentages will be lower in all cases. For example; persons who enter in 1926&quot; at all ages over 18 will pay no part of the cost of the Old Age Pensions to which they will.become entitled.&apos; As indicated above, however, entrants at ages over 16 are a minority of all who become subject to compulsory insurance.12. The   contribution   in   respect   of   certain   persons   in&apos; excepted&quot; employment under the Health Insurance system&quot; &quot;is fixed at 2d. less than the normal rate for men, and Id. less than; that rale for women.   The grounds on which exception has been &quot;ranted to employers in these&apos; cases show, as a rule, that adequate&apos; provision has been made for the maintenance of the employees&apos; concerned in old age. : Where&apos; such&apos; is the case, insurance- is&apos;: provided by the Bill i in respect of - widows&apos; and orphans&apos; benefits, I    but not in respect of pensions between the ages of 65 and 70.   The i    only large class of persons in, excepted employment in respect of 1    which it is believed that statutory provision is made for widows and ft    orphans, in addition to provision for old age,, is that of the -police, j    It is accordingly assumed that of the persons, in excepted &apos; employ-m   merit the police only will be wholly excluded from the provisions of B   the Bill.  In regard to all other persons in excepted employment, it, B   lias.been assumed that insurance for widows&apos; and orphans&apos; benefits1 B   only will be required.   In the case of entrants at the age of 10 B   the benefits thus to be insured are worth seven-tenths of the&apos; full&apos; benefits, and since the latter have been estimated to be worth&quot;, oh&apos; the joint basis explained above, lOd. for a man and 5d. for a woman.&apos; the contributions for the restricted, benefits have been fixed at &apos;7cf*.; and Bid. respectively.   The persons of this class not being&apos;entitled&apos; to pensions-at 65 are not, within the provisions of- the Bill inrespect; of Old Age Pensions at 70.   They are accordingly excluded from the1 requirement of the Bill relative to decennial increases in the rate of contribution.   The number of persons in the class is estimated to&apos;bev 265,000; of whom 225,000 are men and 40,000 women.       &apos;&quot;There is a small class of persons, estimated to number abbin,; H 40,000, who hold certificates of exemption under the National Health&apos;&apos;&apos; I Insurance system. Persons of this class are found to a large extent: M (o be provided for in old age, and are accordingly dealt&apos; witli iii1&apos; B the Bill in practically the same way as those who are in excepted&apos; H  employment. &apos;&apos;&apos;&quot; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;Voluntary Contributors-: -.-..)t&apos;i13. The rates of contribution have&quot; been computed upon the&apos; B assn&apos;l1Pt&apos;?n fchat insurance is compulsory and, consequently,&quot; that&apos; BJ l&apos;0,1ti&apos;ibutions will he-obtained from all:,employed&apos; persofis&apos; whether&apos;
-married or&apos;umuarried:; The&apos;contiibutiorisw6iild;be quite inadequate for a&apos;scheme based on voluntary insurance lirider which the yburm and the unmarried would have little or no inducement to pay, and it would be impossible to .frame such a scheme without imposing oh the Exchequer a contingent liability of enormous extent or, ; (alternatively, without providing for much heavier contributions than those proposed by the Bill.Hut: while the basis of the scheme is compulsion, linked with employment, the Bill provides for the continuance of insurance, on a -voluntary footing, in the case of those persons who leave compulsory insurance, either because they cease to be employed or :because their employment ceases to be ihsnrable, e.r/., on their remuneration passing the limit of  250 a year. In view of fchj altered conditions which the scheme sets up, the Bill also permits - any &quot;person, who was insured under the Health Insurance &apos; Act - for at least two years prior to the commencement of the Act but -has not become a voluntary contributor on ceasing to be insurably employed, to re-enter insurance; if he so desires, -A&apos; corresponding provision is made for persons who have, nt &apos; some tinre since the National Health Insurance; system was introduced, been in excepted employment at rates of remuneration /not exceeding  250 a year. Ail of these cases in which voluntary ihsurahee is to be. permitted will involve the grant of a valuable option, and it must be -assumed that in general this option will be exercised against the Exchequer. It is, however, provided that a person who desides to be a, voluntary contributor under the net scheme must also be such a contributor for the Health Insurance benefits, and must pay the employees part of the joint contribution under both, systems.&apos; The full weekly rate of contribution for a voluntary contributor &apos;&apos;ihfthe first ten years will thus be Is. fid. in the case of a man, and Is. &quot;Id. ih&apos;the case of a woman.14&apos;. The number of persons&apos; who &apos; will be eligible to enter insurance as voluntary contributors at&apos;the outset is unknown. The number of lapses from Health Insurance has, it is believed, averaged from three to four hundred thousand a year; but the number of re-entries to insurance is believed also to have been very large, and the number of persons at present outside the Health Insurance scheme who have at some time been insured&apos;under it for at;least two- years is not ascertainable. Nor, if the number, were known, could any forecast be made of the extent to which the &quot;individuals concerned would elect to take advantage of the new option. In these circumstances nothing beyond a reasonable assumption can be made for the purpose of the estimates. The assumption adopted as to entrants at the outset is that one hundred thousand men, all of them married, will come into insurance as voluntary contributors. Further, the age distribution of this group has been taken with due regard to the fact that the valuable pensions provided for tk contributor himself and for his wife are likely to be as attractive s part of the scheme as the widows&apos; pension. It has thus been assumed that of the 100,000 entrants on a voluntary basis nearly ene-half will-he-aged over? 55;. ^Further, for the purpose of the
estimates,;ithe, (jJ^jiasHb^e^^^o^toiiiiiohilde&apos; insured ,peKSon*.over the age .of, $0 at: the commencement of the Act who,- on,that date will have ceased for less than a year and a half to be -engaged&apos; in an insurable employment, and will. consequently -be entitled to bring their previous contributory, period into account for the purpose of securing the five years&apos; qualification for pension at 65. In such cases the right to a /pension will in general accrue in January 1928 notwithstanding the fact that contributions on a voluntary basis will have been paid by those concerned for two years only. The capital liability imposed upon the Exchequer in respect of this class of contributor, other than that arising, from the rights, given in respect of Old Age Pensions at. 70, is estimated, on these assump-lions, at  12 millions, the value of the benefits being computed at .113 millions and that of the contributions at  1 million only.As regards persons who will cease in future to be conipulsorily insurable and will have, the option to continue on a voluntary basis, a series of assumptions,has been made, the combined effect of which is to give approximately. 37,000 new voluntary contributors each year, of whom about 30,000 are.men (rather more than 25,000 of these being married) and 7,000 women. While these numbers are arbitrarily derived, they, are believed to supply a reasonable measure of the probable effect of the provisions for voluntary insurance to which they relate..15. Bringing in the 100,000 persons assumed to enter as volun-tary-contributors at the outset, the number of voluntary contributors between the ages of 16 and 65 is estimated as being  :  .In 1930......       ...... 223,000In 1940.........       ... 347,000In 1950 ..&apos;.......... 403,000In 1960 ..............&quot;&apos; 428,000       -    &apos;these numbers represent the following proportions of the whole number of contributors:  &apos;&apos;&quot; .!The increase in the estimated number of voluntary contributors is immaterial after 1960, the proportion of these contributors to the total never rising to 3 per cent.16. The Bill provides for the grant of pensions and allowances to certain widows, with children under age 14 and.to orphan children existing at. the commencement of the Act.: The pension.to a widow of this class, is to cease six months after her youngest child attains age 14, In these cases the benefits, will, be granted free of eontri-hutjions, in ,yiew of.:the,insurable ,status under National:,HealthPer cent.1930 1940 1950 196015 2 1 2-4 2-6The Non-Contribtjtoby Classes.

TKe/numbers of beneficiaries under tnese provisions are estimated to be as follows :-i    Widows with children under age 14&apos;     ,..   196,000 m      Children under age 14 (including 31,000children, both of whose parents are dead)   386,000The number of widows here stated is 80 per cent, of the whole number of widows with children under 14 in the population, as estimated, after deducting such of those widows as are in receipt of war pensions. The figure of 80 per cent, is arrived at after a eare-fnl scrutiny&apos; of the proportion which the number of men insured bears to the whole number of men in the population within the age groups to which the great majority of the widows with young children should be related. For&apos; men of the ages 20 to 25 this proportion is -84 per cent.; at 25 to 30 it is 82 per cent.; at the following ages the proportion falls steadily to 70 per cent, within the.age group 45 to 50. On these data it is&quot;considered that the figure.of 80 per cent, supplies a close measure of.the proportion of the..widows with children under 14 in.the whole population which will he qualified for benefits under the Bill. :::&apos;..-&apos;.;&apos;&quot;l,t. The benefits to these classes begin in January 1926. It is. estimated that in the first complete-year (1926-27) the. amount payable in benefits will be  9,100,000,&apos; and that the capital value at.&apos;&quot;th(l commencement of the. Act of the total amount to be paid to this, class will be  42,000,000.&apos; f &apos; i &quot;  Future Beneficiaries. /.-18. Pensions to persons between the ages of 65 and 70 are to begin on 1st&apos;January, 1928. The year 1928-29 will, therefore, he the first complete year of the working of the scheme, so far as concerns benefits.The estimated numbers of beneficiaries in future years are as shown by the following Table. These numbers relate to the middle of.the financial year&apos;and have not been carried to a later year than 1985-66. . There are indications of further continued growth in their numbers, but in view of the speculative character necessarily attaching to calculations relating to distant periods it has been doomed inadvisable to attempt formal estimates extending beyond the .year named.:,i9. The basis of Table III is explained in the Appendix. As regards persons who are pensioned from 65 to 70, it is estimated that those whose qualification is derived from compulsory insurance will-represent, in the case of men and married women, 53^ per cent, ofi the population at these ages, and,, in the case of women other than the married, 13 per cent. This latter figure, which is largely explained by the fact that -few women of such advanced age as 65 are. employed in industry, will gradually increase as widows who haye.been pensioned in virtue of their husbands&quot; insurances attain the, age,,,qf...65.;!iThe/prQportion&quot;.of widows in-- the ^population who will
2probable,, rise eventually to iully.70 per cent. .      . . .The proportions of the pensioned to the population will alsabe gradually increased as voluntary contributors reach the age of 65.&apos; If the assumptions made as regards this class for the purpose of the present estimates are realised, the proportions of the population in receipt of pensions between the ages of 65 and 70 (other than widows) will ultimately be 64 per cent, in the case of men and married women and 27 per cent, in the case of unmarried womciuTable III.-Numbers ol Beneficiaries.j Non-Contributory Oases.Year.I Widows.Children.Contributory Cases.Widows.Children.Persons aged 65-70 Men.

It is provided, by the Bill that any person who is entitled to&apos; or in receipt of an old age pension or widow&apos;s pension, at the date-on which he or she reaches the age of 70 shall become entitled to- iiM pension for the remainder of life at the full rate Of 10s. a week; This concession is also extended to existing persons- over the age&apos;; of 70 who are qualified by virtue of insurance under the Health&apos;; Insurance Acts, and to the wiyes and widows aged over 70 of farmers&apos; of this class; and in relation to such persons is to be operative from July 1926.  The estimated number of Old Age Pensioners added at&apos; the outset under the proposal is 87,000, rising in 1965-66 to nearly 300,000.   These figures are based upon the somewhat vague &apos; indications afforded by the Census Reports, but are submitted after&quot; a careful study of this material. . . ,21..

It is estimated that in respect of persons brought within the scheme at the outset, whether as contributors or (being then over 70) as pensioners, the provisions of the Bill which amend the present law in regard to Old Age Pensions impose upon the Exchequer a charge representing a present capital value of  126,000,000.23. Apart from its indications of the liability added by the Bill, Table IV is significant as showing the continuous increase to be expected in the cost of Old Age Pensions under the present law. This increase, as a result of which it is estimated that the cost in the present year will be doubled in the year 1955-56, is attributable to two causes firstly, the growth in the annual number of births in the years between 1850 and 1890, and, secondly, the decline in the death rate which has been proceeding for a long period. The statistical evidence by which the results brought out by the Table are supported is given in the Appendix.24, It will be noticed further from Table IV that the estimated cost under the 1908-24 Acts increases by two million pounds between 1925-26 and 1926-27, and by less than half that amount in succeeding years. This exceptional increase at the outset is due to the slow rate at which new claims arising under the Act of 1924 are apparently being made. The whole expected addition under that Act is not included in, the figures for the year 1925^-26, but is included in those for the year 1926-27..
m 16C25. The general result of the new. qualifications for pension.at -vre 70 is to!&apos;confer the &quot;right to a full pension of 10s. a week upon the following classes : (i.) All persons, and the wives of all men, who, on attaining&apos; the age of 70, have been for five years within the scope&apos; of compulsory insurance and have paid the prescribed contributions. This class includes all manual workers in employment,, and all other employed persons whose rate of remuneration does not exceed  250 a year.(ii.) All widows who have received widows&apos; pensions terminating at the age of 70 in virtue of their husbands&apos; insurance under the new scheme. ...&quot;(iii.) All persons who have ceased to be compulsorily insured but have.continued as voluntary contributors and have,; on attaining the age of 70, fulfilled the prescribed conditions.In addition there will be qualified under the present Old Age. Pensions Acts a large number of persons of small means who are; not within the insured class.   Among these will be included :-  (iv.) All unoccupied  persons  whose  means   do  not  exceed  65 5s. if single, or  130 10s. if married. - -(v.) For a reduced rate of pension, all unoccupied persons whose means do not exceed  88 17s. 6d. if single,. or  177 15s. if married.26. It is estimated that under the law as it stands at present 58 per cent, of the men over 70 in the population and 74-j per cent, of the women over 70 will be entitled to Old Age Pensions in 1926-27. The estimated effect of the new provisions is to increase these proportions immediately to 69 per cent, and 76 per cent, respectively, and eventually to 74 per cent, and 77 per cent.. respectively.Exchequer Liability : Summary of Capital &quot;Value. 27. The capital value of the liability assumed by the Exchequer : in respect of persons brought within the scheme at the outset may now be summarised at follows : -For employed persons in compulsory insurance (para. 10)    ...          ... 566,000,000For Voluntary Contributors (para. 14) 12,000,000For Widowed Mothers and Children(para. 17)........         ... 42,000,000For  extended  rights  to  Old  age pensions at 70 (para. 22)        ... 126,000,000Total -  ....     746,000,000    .
National Health Insurance.28. The Bill provides for the termination of the right to sickness and disablement benefits, and for the cessation of contributions, under the National Health Insurance system at the age of Co, when the new pensions will accrue, instead of 70 as at present.Under this condition the weekly contribution required from an entrant at the age of 1.6, on the present financial basis of the Act, to support the proportion of the benefits for which the approved society is responsible, namely, seven-ninths, becomes 7 d. in the case of a man (in lieu of the present amount of 1 %d.), and rather less than Id. in the case of a woman (in place of 7 ^d.).   The liabilities of the approved societies in respect -of their existing members will also be substantially modified as a consequence of the earlier termination of their responsibilities for sickness and disablement benefits, and a corresponding reduction in their assels will be required.   It is accordingly proposed to diminish the reserve values which have been credited to. societies on the assumption that sickness and disablement benefits would be payable to the age of 70.   Allowing for the continuance of these benefits until January 1928 in the case&apos;of insured persons who will be over the age of 65 at this date, and until the attainment of the age of 65 in the case of all younger persons, it is estimated that about  37 millions of the reserve values existing at the end of 1925 will be cancelled.   The weekly contribution retained under Section 6i of the National Health Insurance Act for the provision of interest on, and for the redemption of, reserve values will accordingly k reduced from l$d. to Id. (men), and from l%d. to -fyd. (women), no alteration being made in the period within, which the redemption of reserve values is expected to be completed.29. The Bill thus fixes the Health Insurance contribution at !M a. week in the case of men (3^-d. in the case of men serving will the Forces) and 8^d. a week in the case of women. These rates are less than those at present chargeable by Id. a week in the case of men and %d. a week in the case of women. While securing tin maximum reduction that is administratively practicable this arrange ment leaves a new margin of ^d. a week, available for expenditure on benefits, in the contribution of a woman to Health Insurance. The appropriate method of dealing with this small margin will become a question for the Royal Commission now examining tie system of National Health Insurance, but in this connection it may be pointed out that the aggregate product of the margin is equivalent to about 20 per cent, of the existing cost of disablement benefit in respect of women under 65, a point which is of some importance having regard to the present upward tendency in this charge upon the funds of approved societies. The proposals of the Bill make no alteration in the existing right of an insured person to receive medical benefit for the whole of life. In future, however, this right will be secured by the payment of contributions to tie age of 65 instead of&apos; to 70, a point which has received due attention in commuting the new-rates of contribution.
30. The liability-&apos; of -theExchequer to-/provide two-ninths of the cost of sickness and disablement benefits (including the cost of administration) to persons over 65 will cease from January, 1928. The estimated relief to the Exchequer under this head is about .- 400,000 a year.Unemployment Instjbance.31. -The Bill provides for a reduction in the contribution of the Exchequer to Unemployment Insurance at the rate of Id. a week in the case of men and Jd.. a week in the case of women, boys and girls, to take effect from the 6th January, 1928. This reduction is made in consideration of the relief of the Unemployment Fund from the present considerable liability entailed by the payment: of unemployment benefit to persons over the age of 65.It is estimated that, when age pensions commence, some 300,000 of the persons insured under the Unemployment Insurance scheme will be over the age of 65. The statistics&apos; published by the Ministry of Labour indicate-&apos;] that on present experience the average weekly number unemployed at these ages will then be about 65,000.    -r.The effect of making the right to unemployment benefit cease, at age 65 will be to relieve the Unemployment Fund of the liability arising in respect of the above 65,000 and of the relative-cost- of administration. I estimate that the Fund will thereby be- relieved of annual charges amounting to  2,870,000 and  80,000 respectively. On. the&apos; other hand, it will lose the whole of&apos;the contributions of such persons of these ages as cease to work as a result of the grant of the new pensions, and it will receive onlyifhe contribution of the employer with a correspondingly reduced Exchequer contribution in respect of those who continue at work. Taking these two factors together, I estimate that the receipts from contributions will be reduced by  850,000 a year. On balance, therefore, the Unemployment Fund will benefit to the extent of  2,100,000 a year. The cost to the Fund, on the other hand, of the proposed reduction in the Exchequer contribution for persons under age 65 is estimated at  1,800,000 in the year 1928-29, rand does not subsequently rise to any material extent. -     i32. After the termination of the &quot;deficiency period&quot; of the Unemployment Fund, the contributions of employers, workers-and the Exchequer are each to be reduced, as the law now stands,;to 6d. a week in the case of men with corresponding rates in the ease of women and young persons. The State contribution will thus-be one-half of the contributions paid by employers and workers. Under the new conditions the State contribution would fall to -;be reduced by Id. for men and ^d. for other classes, and would accordingly become five-twelfths of the joint contribution- of employer and worker in the case of men, with slightly different fractions in the case of women, boys and girls respectively. ;In order to avoid the complication which would arise if the contribu-tions of the. four classes.. of contributors had to be separately aggregated for the purposes, oidetermining&apos;-/thei grant,.from.(the [18011] &quot;   c
Exchequer, the appropriate average fraction has been calculated, and is found to be three-sevenths. The Bill accordingly provides that when the contributions for Unemployment Insurance are reduced the payment by the Exchequer shall be three-sevenths of the total paid by the employers and the workers, instead of one-half as at present provided.The New Benefits contrasted with the existing Health and Unemployment Benefits.33. In view of the heavy cost of sickness and disablement benefits under the  National Health Insurance  system  and of unemployment benefit to persons of 65 to 70 years of age, an estimate has been made of the aggregate amount of benefits which this class of persons will receive under the new system in contrast with the benefits under the existing systems which they will forgo.   The number of insured persons under the Health system between these ages in 1928-29 may be put at 350,000, of whom 300,000 will be men and 50,000 women.   Making due allowance for additional benefits, and taking.into account the present relation of expenditure on benefits, at these ages to the provision made by the financial basis of the Insurance Act, it is estimated that in the course of a year the individuals comprising this class would receive in sickness and disablement benefits  1,800,000 and would themselves pay in contributions  250,000, giving a net excess of benefits over contributions amounting to . 1,550,000.   So far as Unemployment Insurance is concerned it is estimated that 250,000 persons within the group 65-70 would be insured, and on current experience  of  unemployment  would  receive  in benefits  about  2,400,000, while paying in contributions  330,000, or a net excess in benefits of  2,070,000.   Adding this amount to the corresponding figure for Health Insurance, a net charge under the two existing systems of  3,620,000 is arrived at.   Under the provisions of the Bill, but not including the pensions payable to widows of men who die after attaining the-age of 65, the estimated expenditure its pensions to and in respect of the persons comprised in the group would be  12,400,000 and no contributions would be payable.   The new benefits granted to the group thus represent about 3  times the net amount receivable in respect of the rights under the existing systems, and are payable, moreover, free of all the conditions and restrictions by which the payments of sickness and unemployment benefit are necessarily controlled.Special Provisions as to Seamen.34. Following the National Health Insurance Acts, the Bil makes special provisions with regard to masters and seamen in th Mercantile Marine. The cases intended to be dealt with are thos of seamen engaged in the foreign trade, in regard to whom it ha been estimated that the average working year consists of 42 w;eel;s
19 9during which the man is continuously at work withoubthe ordinary weekly breaks in labour enjoyed by the. normal insured person. The average number of weeks for which the latter is at work in the; year may be taken as approximately 48, and it follows that in respect of seamen in the foreign-going trade only seven-eighths of the normal -amount of contributions will be collected.   The Bill provides that the contributions and benefits are to be at the ordinary; rates in respect of this class, and without other provision, therefore, the ; class would be placed in a position of advantage, as against the Exchequer, by reason of the conditions of its employment.   This difficulty has been dealt with in the following manner.   There is a further class of seamen employed in the foreign trade, namely, foreigners, who are neither domiciled nor have a place of residence in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.   Men of this class will not&apos;be entitled to the benefits of the scheme and no contributions are to be paid by them.   The Bill provides, however, that the employers:&apos; contribution shall be paid in respect of them, and the product of this contribution will go to the Pensions Account.The number of British seamen in the foreign trade, though not&apos; definitely known, is understood to be at least 100,000. Taking this figure for the purpose of the present estimates, the class would, for the reasons explained above, impose upon the Exchequer a loss in contributions of  22,000 a year.. The contribution rate, to National Health Insurance in respect of foreigners on British ships trading to this country is 3d. a week, and the product of this contribution in the year 1922, as shown by the accounts of the Special Fund set up. for Seamen&apos;s Pensions under the National ITealth Insurance Acts, was;  23.-154. The new contribution in respect of this class will be lid-a week, and it would therefore appear that the product of this contribution will approximate to  35.000 a year. The loss arising out of the shortage of contributions paid for British seamen will thus be covered by the contributions paid in respect of foreigners so long as the proportion of the latter class to the former remains at its present level.Administration Expenses.35. The Bill provides, in regard to the expenses incurred m the administration of the Act, that such part of those expenses as the Treasury may direct shall - be charged to the Pensions Account. For the purpose of the present estimates the amount so to be charged has been &apos; taken&quot; as  300,000 for the year 1925-26 and  500,000 a year for every subsequent year. 1&apos;hese amounts are taken to include the expenditure incurred by the Post Office in the distribution of pensions. They represent, in the first ten full years, about 2 per cent, of the contributions receivable.Summary of Income ano Expenditure.36. The following Table (V) shows,, for a. series of-years, the aggregate amounts of contributions and benefits under the new [13011]
scheme, with provision for the cost of administration,-,the additional&apos; charge&apos;hi respect of Old&apos;Age Pensions to persons over 7.0 -for which the Bill provides, the relief to the Exchequer in respect of persons over 65 entitled, under present conditions, to Health and Unemployment benefits, and, in the final column, ;the net charge upon the Exchequer which it is estimated will arise as the result of the proposals made in the Bill..37. In preparing this Table it has been assumed in regard to the early years of the scheme that unemployment will average 8 per cent, over the whole of the insured population at ages under 65 during the year 1926-27, falling by regular gradations to-the normal rate of 5 per cent., which is assumed to be reached in the year 1930-31. The higher of these rates represents an average number of unemployed persons of about 1,180,000 in 1926-2&quot; (of which 1,100,000 are taken to be in the industries insured against unemployment). The lower rate represents about 750,000 persons, of whom 700,000 may be taken as being in the industries covered by tbe unemployment scheme.For the first three months-after contributions begin to be payable (January to March 1926) due consideration has been given, in estimating, the probable contributions, to the fact that seasonal unemployment will then be at its peak, the number unemployed in the.industries covered being taken at 1,200,000.88. Table V has been prepared to show the charge falling upon the Exchequer, in periods corresponding as nearly as may be witli I lie provisions of the Bill as to decennial increases of contribution These increases, however, begin on the 1st January in each ol the years concerned, while the Table relates to financial years. It follows that for the last three months of the financial years 1935-36, 1945-46 and 1955-56 an-additional contribution income amount-ing to about TI j millions is brought in as compared, in each case, with the contributions of the previous year. On the other hand, the contributions for the years 1936-37, 1946-47 and 1956-57 include the additional income for a full year, thus explaining the decrease in the Exchequer charge in these years as compared, in each case, with that of the previous year.89. The temporary slackening of the increase in the charge at about the year 1955 is due to the loss of population aged 65-70 at this time which is attributable to deaths in the Great War.40. As there is no increase in contributions after the year 1955-56, the charge must be expected to rise with some regularity after 1965-66, the last year covered by the Table. It may in the long run approach stability that is very much a question of changes in the age distribution of the insured population but there are no grounds for expecting that it will diminish to any material extent That this is so is due to the fact that the contributions, although related to the benefits of those who will have come under the scheme in their youth, will have been wholly inadequate for the great mass of the 15 million contributors brought in at the beginning. As Iras been shown, a large deficiency arises from this cause at the out-
set and widowoctliis&apos;-deficiency&apos;&apos;is&apos; anghWnted &apos;b&apos;y! the.benefits granted to ... mothers and children for whom no contributions have been paid. From 1928 the resulting.loss is operative; a^growing;charge falls upon the Exchequer and this represents,1 in substance,,interest upon the deficiency. It is to be observed that, in this connection, the scheme must be taken eventually to include a growing portion, and ultimately the whole, of the cost of Old Age Pensions after 70, in view of the fact that the product of the decennial increases of contribution is credited to the scheme. This latter consideration will not arise during the period covered by Table V, since no. Old Age Pensions at&apos; 70 towards the provision of which contributions have been made by the insured and their employers will come in course of payment till about 1980. But whether it arises in the years covered by the Table, or in the distant period lying beyond those years, the charge to be borne by the Exchequer represents in fact a sum which, if adequate contributions could have been, and had been paid from the beginning by all concerned, would have, boon forthcoming year by year from interest incoma.

The Pensions Account.41. It will be seen from Column (7) of Table V that the charges arising under the Bill, other than charges in respect of pensions to persons over 70, amount to less than the contributions up to March 1928; thereafter the charges exceed the contributions by an increasing annual sum, the excess amounting in 1935-36 to nearly , 13 millions. It is proposed by the Bill to equalise the charge upon the Exchequer in respect of the period up to the 31st March, 1936, and for this purpose to pay a sum of  4 millions annually for 10 years into the Treasury Pensions Account. As indicated by the heading to Column (7) the amounts shown in this column do not include the additional cost resulting from the provisions of the Bill in respect of Old Age Pensions to persons over 70; nor do they give effect to the relief which the Exchequer will derive under the scheme from the termination of Health and Unemployment Insurance benefits at the age of 65. The net charge falling upon the Exchequer in respect of each of the first 10 years beginning the 1st April, 1926, is, therefore, to be obtained by bringing these items together as shown in the following table : Table VI.(Figures in   millions.)Year. i(i.)

It is estimated that under the arrangement described in para. 41 the Treasury Pensions Account will be In possession of a small surplus on the 31st March, 1936. As shown in column (7) of Table V, it is estimated that the charge upon the-Exchequer, other than that arising in respect of Old Age Pensions over 70, will rise in 1936-37 to 1:10,600,000, as against the corresponding charge of  4,000,000 paid into the Treasury Pensions Account for the year 1935-36. If the present anticipations are realised and the Account shows &amp; moderate surplus at the end of the first ten years, the large increase in the charge in 1936-37 will be substantially modified, and a. smoothly graduated progression from the conditions of the first, decennial period to those of later years will thus be effected.

The last column of the foregoing table shows the effect&apos;&apos; the equalising arrangement proposed for the first ten years i&apos; respect of the new Pensions. The combined charges upon tin Exchequer in tlie year 1935-36 amount to  85 millions or atom  9 millions less than is represented by the actual distribution oj benefits in that year. The equalising provision terminates witli the year 1935-36.Decennial Be view.45. In calculating the contribution appropriate to the type of benefits provided by the Bill, and in estimating the charges M to arise under the scheme during a long series of years, accop has to be taken-of many factors, and in. various directions attenf have,, to be made to forecast the effect of changes which * constantly taking place in conditions affecting the social state of I&quot;43. In the following table.-;the- net&apos; Exchequer-Charges ariaiif under the Bill are set out in parallel columns with the estimate! liability for Old Age Pensions at 70 and for War Pensions..

liople. Examples-of thisatonce&quot;suggest themselves in the death rate and the birth rate. The death rate has for a long time been lending to fall, though the fall has been irregular and lias varied between different periods of life. The birth rate has greatly decreased in recent years, and, in this case also, there have been ride variations. Abnormalities have been set up in the age distribution of the population by the great number of deaths due to the war, and the effects of these will be reflected in various ways lor a long period. Emigration also, which has been materially iftected by the war with a resulting though scarcely identifiable fleet upon the present population, may be profoundly affected in he future by the industrial conditions of this and other countries. Hie distribution of the population as between productive industry iud other forms of occupational activity may also vary, with ^responding effects upon the proportion of the population brought within the scope of a scheme of compulsory insurance. Further, experience only can determine how far the assumptions made as to the continuance of insurance on a voluntary basis in the case of persons who leave insurable employment will be realised. The estimates presented in this Report have been framed after long study of the probable interaction of the forces operating to affect ihe figures. In the circumstances indicated they can be no more Ihan estimates, giving due regard to observed tendencies, but limited always by present knowledge and possibilities of deduction bin present tendencies. Bearing in mind this important tonsideration, provision is made by the Bill for an actuarial review (I the operation of the scheme at decennial intervals. Such a. review will provide the opportunity for exploration of the continued irritability of the contribution charged and for examination of the probable course of the liability of the State. It is assumed that, ier the scheme comes into operation statistical records in tonnection with it will be set up of a sufficiently comprehensive rlraractor to provide the material for this periodical survey of its forking.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,ALFRED W.
