[This&apos; Document.is the property of His Britannic Majestys Bovernment.]Printed for the Cabinet.      May 1925.SECRET-CP. 222(25).MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.Matrimonial jurisdiction of British Indian Courts in respect of persons resident, but not domiciled in India.I circulate to my colleagues the Report of an inter-departmental Committee on the above subject. The Committee was appointed by my predecessor, and having considered&apos; their recommendations, I desire to introduce legislation on the lines indicated in para. 5 of the Report for the reasons given in paras. 2 and 3.I have no expectation that time will serve to pass into law the proposed Bill during the present session. But once the Bill is introduced in the House of Lords and given a second reading, I should be in a position to urge upon the Government of India the amendment of the Indian Act without further delay, so as to confine jurisdiction under it to persons domiciled in India, and so put an end to the existing confusion described in para. 2 of this Report.BIRKENHEAD.1st May 1925.363   100      5.25
REPORTOFInter-Departmental Committee on Matrimonial Jurisdiction of British Indian Courts in respect of persons resident, but not domiciled, in India.In July last the Secretary of State for India, with the concur-renee of the Lord Chancellor and of the Secretaries of State for Home Affairs and the Colonies, set up a Committee to advise him on the problems connected with the subject indicated in the title to this Report, the Committee consisting of the following persons : Sir William Vincent, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I. ) appointed by the Secre-Sir Edward Chamier, K.O.I.E. &apos; j   tary of State for India.Sir Claud Schuster, K.C.B., C.V.O., K.C., appointed by the Lord Chancellor.Mr. 0. F. Dowson, O.B.E., appointed by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs.Mr. H. G. Bnshe, appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Mr. M. Millar Craig, appointed by the Secretary for Scotland.2. Briefly stated, the problem which the Committee was invited to consider was the situation created by the judgment of the President of the Divorce Division in the case of Keyes v. Keyes and Gray (L.R., 1921, Prob. Divn. 204), the effect of which was that a decree ot: divorce granted by ,an Indian Court under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, is invalid outside British India if the parties to the marriage which it purported to dissolve were not domiciled in that country. The judgment further cast grave doubts upon the power of British Indian Courts to grant decrees at all in such cases. Since the decision of Keyes v. Keyes and Gray this, latter aspect of the matter has, however, been the subject of judgments of two Indian High Courts those of Lahore and Bombay.&apos;&quot; The effect of the Lahore High Courfs decision is that, although the dissolution by an Indian Court of a marriage the parties to which were not domiciled in India will no longer be recognised by the Courts of the United Kingdom and will probably not be recognised else-where, the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, does empower-and, indeed, require &quot; competent&quot; Indian Courts to entertain and grant decrees to such parties if they choose to resort to the Indian Courts, that decrees so granted are valid in British India, and that the parties to a suit so decreed are free to contract second marriages which are valid in British India. The Bombay High Court, on the other hand, have by a majority accepted the position that Courts in India have no jurisdiction to dissolve a marriage the parties to which are not domiciled in India. One judge, however, dissented from this decision and gave his reasons for disagreeing with the judgment in Keyes v. Keyes.   It is conceivable, therefore, that the* I.L.R. (Bombay), Vol. XLVII, 843 (1923). I.L.R. (Lahore), Vol. V, 147 (1924). 38       100 5.25
decision in the Bombay case, if a similar question came before Full Bench, might be overruled.The position therefore is, that although the Indian Divnw Validity Act, 1922 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. V., c. 18), has cured past enon yet so long as the decision in Keyes v. Keyes and Gray stands and so long as the Indian High Courts, or any of them, maintain the view of their powers and duties under the Indian Divorce Ac! 1869, which has been adopted by the Lahore High Court ami so long, again, as the non-domiciled European community in India continues, in the Punjab or in any other province the High Court of which takes the same view of the law as the Lahore Hiou Court has done, to resort to those Courts in matrimonial causes British subjects will continue to secure dissolution of their marriages which will be of no effect outside India, and even possibly, in certain provinces of India itself ; and if they contract second marriages on the strength of Indian decrees of dissolution those second marriages will, except in India, or even possibly except only in certain parts of India, be bigamous, and their issue be illegitimate.3. We consider that the position just described is very imsatis-factory and cannot be left unremedied. But having regard to the size of the European community habitually resident, for official or business reasons, in India for loug periods of their lives, but not legally domiciled there, and to the fact that for over 50 years (lie Conrfs in British ludia have exercised divorce jurisdiction over members of this community, without the occurrence, so far as is known, of any case of injustice, we are strongly of opinion that a remedy which would consist merely in so amending the Indian Act as to confine jurisdiction under it to causes to which the parties are domiciled in India will result in grave hardship and injustice to the non-domiciled community. This hardship is accentuated and more serious still in the ease of a married woman who, but for her husband&apos;s domicile, would herself be domiciled in India. &quot;While, therefore, the recommendations which we have to make are based upon, the assumption that this change in the Indian law will in fact be carried out, wo consider that it should be accompanied by Parliamentary legislation conferring upon selected judges of certain Indian Courts matri-monial jurisdiction, of the nature and subject to the limitations presently to be described, in respect of persons domiciled in England, Wales or Scotland but ordinarily resident in India.4. We recognise that our proposal as thus briefly indicated is only partial, in that it will afford relief only to persons resident in India whose domicile is in Eugland, Wales or Scotland. Further, the proposal will not ensure that decrees granted by Indian Courts to parties domiciled, in England, Wales or Scotland will he recognised by the Courts of parts of the Empire other than that in which the parties are domiciled or of foreign countries. But as regards the first point, the enactment of Empire-wide legislation for the purpose of embracing the small minority of. the persons concerned who would not be covered by the proposal (viz., those persons resident in India who are domiciled in parts of the Empire other than England, Wales or Scotland) would, on account of the necessity involved of consulting all the Dominions and Colonies, gravel) delay the provision of &quot;the relief sought for the majority. And as
regards the second point we think that the general trend of decided cases is such as to give reasonable grounds for antici-pation that the decrees to be granted in India under the proposals we have to make, being (as ex hypotliesi they would be) recognised as valid by the Courts of the domicile, would be similarly recognised by the Courts elsewhere. It need hardly be added that the reason why we do not propose that our scheme should embrace persons domiciled in Northern Ireland is that such persons, having no facilities for divorce in the State of their domicile, can make no reasonable claim to obtain such facilities by reason of mere residence in India. Although, therefore, persons domiciled in Northern Ireland have had in the past the remedies hitherto assumed to have been available under the Indian law equally with other persons professing the Christian religion, we see no grounds under the new conditions now to be met for including them within the scope of our proposals.5. We now proceed to indicate in detail the exact scope of our proposals, which, as already stated, are throughout subject to the understanding that Indian legislation of the nature indicated in para. 3 will be enacted. We trust that our proposals will-in the main prove self-explanatory, and in order to keep this Report within reasonable limits we proceed to set them out in a series of propositions, to which we append only such explanations as seem essential to indicate the guiding considerations we have kept in view. We propose legislation by Parliament with the following main features : (i) That the Chief Justice of each of the Chartered High Courts referred to in sections 101-114 of the Government of India Act should be empowered to nominate, with the approval of the Lord Chancellor, a judge or judges for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction to entertain petitions, and grant decrees, or make orders, subject to the limitations and safeguards set out in later paragraphs, for (i) divorce a vinculo matrimonii,(ii) damages,(iii) alimony,(iv) custody of children, and(v) costs, 5to petitioners professing the Christian religion who reside in India at the time of presenting the petition, but whose domicile (i.e., the domicile of the husband) is in England, Wales or Scotland, if (a) the marriage was solemnised in India, or (b) the matrimonial offence complained of was committed in India.(With reference to clause (i) we would note that section 109 of the Government of India Act empowers the Governor-General in Council to authorise any Chartered High Court to exercise any portion.of its jurisdiction in any part of British India not included within the limits for which the Court was established, and also to exercise such jurisdiction in respect of a British subject within any part of India oucside British India. We have no doubt that this power would be so utilised as to extend throughout the country the jurisdiction referred to in this clause of our proposals.)
(ii) That the judge should have full discretion to refuse to entertain a petition for divorce presented by a petitioner not domiciled in India, if the petitioner cannot show that by reason of official duty, poverty or any other sufficient cause, he or she is prevented from suing in the Courts of the domicile, or if the Court is not satisfied that in the interests of justice it- is desirable that the suit should be determined in India.(iii) That the grounds on which a decree of divorce may be granted should be specified in the proposed Act as being those on which a similar decree might be granted by the High Court; of Justice in England under the law for the time being in force in England.(iv) That the practice and procedure of the Indian Courts in exercise of this jurisdiction should be prescribed by rules under the Act made by the Secretary of State for India in Council with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor, and that the provision giving power to make such rules should also include a requirement on the lines of section 7 of the. Indian Divorce Act, 1869, that the Indian Courts skill act and give relief upon principles as nearly as may be conformable to those upon which the High Court of Justice in England for the time being acts and gives relief.(v) That the proposed Act shall definitely provide that a decreeor order passed by a judge of an Indian High Court in exercise of the jurisdiction thereby conferred shall be ami for all purposes be treated as being as valid as if it had been granted by the High Court of Justice in England or the Court of Session in Scotland, and that it shall be registered in the High Court in England (or, in the case of parties domiciled in Scotland, in the Court of Session).(vi) That the Governor-General in Council should be consulted as to the desirability and feasibility of nominatiug an officer in each province to be charged with the duties and functions appertaining to the office of King&apos;s Proctor in this country.(vii) That an appeal should lie from the decision of the trial judge to a bench of two judges of the High Court, nominated fn a manner similar to that proposed for the trial judge. (This proposal would not affect any right of appeal to the Judicial Committee which exists in such cases under the present law.)6. We recognise that there are differences between the law of Scotland and that of England in the matter of divorce as regards the grounds on which a decree may be pronounced, and as regards the effects of a decree upon the property of the parties. We do not, however, feel able to recommend that provision should be made in the case of persons domiciled in Scotland for the special application to them of Scots law when they petition for and are granted decrees of divorce, or are divorced, in India. The object of our proposals is to enable]Scotsmen (and others) resident in India to obtain decrees of divorce, and consequential orders, which shall be valid, instead ot being invalid, outside India, and, in so doing, to make as liltle change as possible in what has been assumed, for the past hat-century to be their status in this respect under Indian law.   Ilie
3 Sisi-ounds which, during this period, have enabled Scotsmen, in common with other persons domiciled in. India, to obtain decrees are those specified in section 10 of the Indian Act, which, broadly speaking, reproduced the grounds laid down by English law. If now it were to be provided that a person domiciled in Scotland could sue in the Indian Courts for divorce on grounds admissible under Scottish, but not under English, law, the effect would be to extend for such a person the grounds on which he has hitherto been able to sue in India by adding to those grounds the ground of desertion. It is true that by specifying the grounds now to be admissible in India as those from time to time recognised by English law, we shall be extending for all petitioning wives to whom the proposed legislation will apply the grounds hitherto available to them in India, since they will now be entitled to sue. on the ground of adultery alone on the part of the husband, which has recently become a valid ground fur divorce in England, but is not (or not yet) so in India. But this is the law in Scotland, and so far as Scotsmen are concerned the conditions in India and in their own country will be pro tanto assimilated.Another practical, and in our opinion very cogent, reason for avoiding provisions which would require Scots law, practice and procedure to be applied by Indian Courts to parties domiciled in Scotland is that there is little or no experience of that law available either on the Bench or at the Bar of Indian Courts ; such provisions would therefore impose upon the Indian Courts an obligation which they would not be qualified to perform. Moreover, Anglo-Indian law in general, in so far as it is not sui generis, is based upon English and not upon Scots law ; Scotsmen are no less subject therefore if they reside in India than an Englishman or Indian to a system which in many important respects differs from that of their own country.7. We have also considered whether any provision would be required enabling the High Court of Justice in England or the Court of Session in  Scotland to vary orders for alimony and custody  which had been made by   Indian  Courts  under  the proposed jurisdiction, but which, on the parties having relinquished-quished  their Indian  residence and  returned to  the  State of domicile, required variation for any reason of change of circum-J stances  or otherwise.    We   are   not  a^vare  of   any   difficulty I having   been   experienced  on   this   account   during   the   half 1 century for which Indian Courts have been making such orders in I the case of non-domiciled litigants, and if such difficulties have not I arisen in the past they will be no more likely to arise under the present proposals.8. In conclusion, we would observe that we are fully sensible of the theoretical objections which attach to our proposals as an I infraction of the established principle that jurisdiction in divorce depends upon domicile, and to the infraction of this principle, if it has to be infringed, in favour of residents in a single&apos; country out of the many which constitute the British Empire. As regards the latter part of this objection, we have indicated in an earlier passage in this Report the practical considerations which, in our view, override it, though we would observe that we think it not unlikely that the Secretary of State for the Colonies may find it desirable to
insert in the proposed Bill a clause enabling its provisions to be extended to other parts of the Empire where conditions are not dissimilar from those obtaining in India. On the general question of the undesirability of infringing the principle of dependence of divorce jurisdiction upon domicile, we can only affirm that we are satisfied that insistence upon this principle now, after a period of over 50 years, during which it has been regarded as having no application to India, will entail grave hardship upon the numerous official and non-official European population of that country.W.
