mSCOTTISH OILS LIMITED.Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.I circulate for the information of ray colleague8 a statement whioh has &quot;been prepared by the Scottish Board of Health, after careful local investigation, showing parish by parish the nature of the dependence of certain districts on the Oil Shale Industry In Scotland,The figures as to the number of persons indirectly dependent on the industry include shopkeepers and their employees, railway workers, school teachers, tradesmen, etc., and their families - in other words, all persons who are dependent for thsir livelihood on the continued existence of the Oil Shale Industry.It will be observed that in 6 of the parishes, viz.:   Midcalder, Weatcalder, Kirkliston, Kirknewton, Livingston and Uphall, over 50$ of the population are dependent, directly or indirectly, on the Shale Industry.     The collapse of that industry would be a severe blow to the whole district and would no doubt considerably affect the coal industry in the neighbouring coal fields.     Apart from the Shale Industry there are (except inI   Bathgate) no industries of any magnitude except agriculture, andj   it is evident that, in the present state of employment, the men from the shale minsa could not find employment either locallyI   or in the neighbouring industrial areas of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.I   Should the mines close down, the Poor Law Authorities would bei   called on to assume an intolerable burden.With regard to TTphall, which includes the large village of Broxburn, almost the entire community is dependent on the Oil Shale Industry.     I understand, however, that a pipe-line has been i   laid from Grangemouth to the Uphall Oil Works by means of which I   imported crude oil is conveyed to the works for refining, and I I   gather from the Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade -I   CP. 275 (25) - that in any case this department of the industry would continue in operation.     The number of men employed in the I  Oil Works, is, however, said to be small in comparison with the 1   number employed in the mines themselves.I suggest that before the question of assisting the I Industry, whether by Admiralty contract or otherwise, is decided, I an effort should be made to obtain further information as to which I mines would probably be closed in the event of the Companies being I left to their own resources, so that the full effect on the 1 unemployment position can be measured.!

The major-ity of the workers, however, reside outwith the parish. Apart from the shale industry, the parish is agricultural and includes the Hopetoun Estate of the_Marquess of Linlithgow.557408674.6Bathgate Is mainly dependent on the coal-mining industry. There -. are oil-works and a shale mine near the eastern border of the parish but the majority of the men employed re-side Outwith the parish. A number of men who are employed in shale-mines in other parishes reside in the Burgh of Bathgate. The Inspector of Poor States that the number of persons in the parish (ppart from those manufactured-ally working in the mines and works) who are de-pendent upon the Indus try Is negligible. Bathgato Is, of course, a shopping centre for the district, and there are 180 shop-keepers in the Burgh who would be affected If the industry collapsed, but not, it is thought, vitally.     Apart from these a few drivers and conductors engaged in the motor-bus services In the district are the only-persons who miiiit be affected.[47^ 582122,20568.71,6005,48669.7 Except for three coal-mining communities in the extreme west of the parish West Calder Is almost wholly dependent on the shale industry. Those In-directly dependent consist largelv of men (and their families)employed in a coal mine which supplies the Oil-works with steam coal.
