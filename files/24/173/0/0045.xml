4r^^/Girculated to the Cabinet by direction of The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.INTER- ALLI ED EKIl^LAND HIGH COMMISSION. British Department.COBLENZ,8th May, 1925.No ,.184,.Sir,,I have the honour to inform you that a Rhineland Millenary celebration is being organised, and will find expression shortly throughout the Occupied Territories, and more especially in Cologne, the chief town of the Rhineland, in ex-hibitions, official visits of Reich and State Ministers, athletic meetings and other functions.The celebration of the Millenary of the year 925.A.D. when Henry 1st. defeated Duke Giselbert of Lotharingia, and joined this province to the Empire of the East Pranks, is intended to mark, the incor-poration and the unity of the Rhineland with Germany for a thousand years.The programmes of the celebrations are being-arranged locally by the various Municipal Authorities.   It is evident, however, from a letter addressed by the Minister of the Interior to the Regierungsprasident of Dusseldorf (a French trans-lation ofiwhich I attach) that the German government is, at least to some extent, organising and finance-ing the.....The Right HonourableJ. Austen Chamberlain, M.P. etc.   etc.   etc.
the manifestations.The celebrations are to commence about the middle of this month, and will continue until September.   The programmes of the Municipalities, have not yet all been drawn up, but such as have been submitted to the High Commission, though differing in detail, bear the same general character.   In all the large towns it is pro-posed to hold a series of indoor celebrations such as receptions, theatrical or musical displays, and ex-hibitions dealing with the past history of the Rhineland. These will be accompanied by out-door celebrations such as processions and athletic meetings.2. While the ostensible reason for the Millenary is the celebration of a historical date in the past of the Rhineland, there is no doubt that the under-lying intention is political and aims at arousing the patriotism of the Occupied Territories.   One of the motives no doubt is the combatting of Separatist ideas, but from reports which I have received from the British zone, there is, at the same time, little doubt that the festivities are generally anti-allied, in nature, and are taking the forms of a protest against the continued occupation of the northern zone, and of a demonstration in favour of the ultimate complete freedom of the Occupied Territories from allied control.The most objectionable feature is the intention of the German authorities to bring into the Occupied Territories by special trains large numbers of persons from un-occupied Germany to take part in the celebrations-brations......
In the little village of Burg near Solingen in the British zone, it is intended to hold an open-air theatrical representation, which it is expected will draw an attendance of 150,000 people, of which a large proportion will come from un-occupied Germany. Similarly large numbers are expected to arrive in Cologne from the un-occupied Territory, and there is reason to believe that special arrangements are being made to bring considerable numbers from Bavaria to attend the celebrations in the Palatinate.It is evident that these patriotic demonstrations will be attended by Nationalists, rather than by the members of parties of the left, and that the presence of large numbers of reactionaries from un-occupied Germany, who have little knowledge of the special regime in the Rhineland, presents grave dangers of the outbreak of disorders.   This appears to be realises-sed by the local authorities, as is instanced by an application from the Police President of Cologne, for a temporary increase of 100 police, to deal with the crowds which are expected in that town,,3.   The whole question has been receiving the earnest attention of the High Commission,,   Several interviews have taken place with the representative of the ober prasident of the Rhine Province, and the High Commission has impressed on this official the neces-sity of avoiding all out-door demonstrations of a nature to inflame passions and provoke disorder.The .....
The action taken by the Oberprasicient has not, however, been productive of much result, and he has informed the High Commission that since the celebrations are being organised locally, he is unable to exercise much influence on the programmes which are being arranged.While the High Commission is apprehensive of the danger which may arise by the influx of large numbers of strangers of anti-allied feelings into the Rhineland it considers that for political reasons, as well as for reasons of fact, it is difficult, if not impossible to take any action other than to keep itself fully informed of the programmes to be carried out, and to forbid such items in the programmes as seem likely to disturb public order.   It would seem that there is littl danger to be apprehended from indoor functions or manl-festations, and the High Commission, therefore, does not propose to intervene as far as these are concerned., On the other hand there is an inherent danger in out-door manifestations, and the High Commission is proposing to give its representatives power to prohibit these in cases where the local situation would appear to make this necessary.40 If, however, the danger of disorder and frictic: between the population and the members of the occupation are to be avoided, it would seem necessary that a re-straining influence should be brought to bear on the celebrations, by the German government.   As stated in the first paragraph of this despatch, the government itself is organising the celebrations to some extent,and.....
and. if in the course of the celebrations excesses occur, the responsibility for them must be borne by the government.I cannot but regret that at the present time, when the general political situation is so delicate that the German government should have thought fit to, encourage throughout the whole of the Occupied Territories these Nationalist demonstrations.I would venture to suggest that His Majesty1s Ambassador at Berlin should be instructed to point out to the German government the responsibility which they are incurring, and to request them to take the nec-essary measures to ensure that the celebrations are carried out in a moderate and non-provocative manner.5.   I would add that the General Officer Command-ing in Chief, as far as the British zone is concerned, views the celebrations with dis-favour, and desires that every effort should be made to have the celebra-tions postponed until the Army has left Cologne.I doubt whether this Is possible, in view of the advanced state of the preparations for the celebrations, or if possible, whether for general political reasons it would now be opportune, but it is clearly desirable that the celebrations should be carried out in such a manner as not to arouse National antagonisms.I attach copy of the letter of the British Military Authorities for information.6. I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin.I have the honour to be, with the highest respectSir,Your most obedient (Signed.)     KilmaKilraarnockhumble servant,
