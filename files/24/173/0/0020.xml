,1S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HISBFITAHBTIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO VERNMEHT-)0 A B I IT E T.ARMS    TRAFFIC    CONFERENCE.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Fore a.Affairs,The conference will meet on May 4th to&quot; draw up aconvention for controlling the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war to replace the abortive convention of St.Germain, 1919,  which has never come into effect owing to the inability of the United States of America to ratify it. The conference will take as the basis of its discussions a draft convention prepared by the Temporary Mixed Commission on Armaments,  an organ of the League of Nations.has been carefully considered by a committee of representatives of the Government departments concerned, who have prepared, a report and a revised draft of the convention itself embodying the changes which the Government departments consider desire-able in British interests.      It ia suggested that  the British delegate should be guided by the recommendations contained in this report.A few words are necessary in regard to the position of China and Egypt.The position in China is  at present governed by an agreement between the Powers having special treaty rights in China, by which they undertake not to export any arms to that country.      The draft convention, if it stood alone, would permit the supply of arms to the Chinese Government, and it is important at present zo prevent any such supply.The draft prepared by the Temporary Mixed Commission
ft pi n &amp; i frIt is therefore proposed that if the guesti on of raising the embargo is mooted at the conference,  the British delegate should  decline altogether to entertain the suggestion and that a clause should he inserted in the convention safe-guarding the right  of concluding special agreements for stricter measures applying to parts of the world where conditions may from time to time necessitate them.The exclusion or inclusion of Egypt in the special zones  (formerly prohibited zones)  of the draft Arms Traffic Convention has been considered by the interdepartmental committee.The idea underlying the new draft is to control the export of arms much more than to prevent the import.      This being the case it was felt that an effort should be made to get Egypt to become a party to the new convention which she was most unlikely to do as long as Egypt was included In the special zones from which Algeria, Tripoli,  and the Spanish Moroccan ports are excluded.,Her exclusion would also obviate various anomalies which have been pointed out by the Admiralty.      Fere Egypt to become a party to the convention whilst remaining in the special zones it is doubtful whether she would be able to fulfil the duties imposed by the draft convention owing to the limitations  on her sovereignty imposed by the capitulations.      On the  other hand she might use the convention to make difficulties over the import by our military and air authorities of arms and ammunition for the British forces.The Egyptian Government not having replied to the invitation to the conference, it was considered desirable that it should be made plain that we would support her
c$ ry ryexclusion from the special zones if sho^ on her part would sign the convention and become a high contracting party.Lord Allenby has been authorised to inform the Egyptian Government to this effect and instructed to ascertain whether they were ready in principle to sign an arms traffic convention,  but no reply has yet boon received(Intd.)

RE P OH T.,T erma^qf^ef reference c e.The Inter-Departmental Committee assembled on four occasions between 25th March and 7th April, 1925, and considered the Convention in great detail.      The main purpose of the Committee was to advise the Government whether the -proposed Convention was a suitable one from the point of view of the British Empire, and where necessary to suggest alterations or amendments.Form of Report,.Ths final result of the woz^k of the Committee is presented in the form of a redraft (Annex A)  of the Temporary Mixed Commission^ convention.     Alongside this redraft,  for the salie of comparison,  are set out the articles of the Temporary Mixed Commission&apos;s original draft Convention. The following remarks, with the Annexes,  give reasons for any important departures from the Temporary Mixed Commission1s draft.Title of the Convention-.The Committee are of   the opinion that the title of the Convention ought more properly- to refer to trade in arms, angaunition and implements of war.      &quot;Munitions&quot; appears to have &quot;crept in by error in translation from the French.      In the English language the term &quot;munitions&quot; might be taken to include all war material, and as such is undesirable.      The Committee recommend, therefore, that wherever &quot;munitions&quot; appears in the Temporary Mixed Commission&apos;s draft, it should be replaced by &quot;ammunition&quot; or &quot;ammunition and implements of war&quot;,  according to the context.Definitions of Arias T Ammunition and imply^T.M.C. draft Article 1,Hew draft       Article 1,The Committee recognize that the attempt to classify arms, ammunition and implements of war for the purpose of this Convention is a serious undertaking.There were three main difficulties :-(a) The classification of arms capable of use both formilitary and sporting purposes.(b) The inclusion of war ships.(c) The inclusion of aircraft.(a)    The Committee consider that specific reference should be made to &quot;sport and personal defence&quot; in the paragraph dealing with military weapons intended for those purposes. They have amended Category II accordingly.lb)    The Admiralty reasons against the Inclusion of war ships in- the Convention are set out in Annex B.      It  is there pointed out that the construction and sale of warships are matters of common knowledge so that it  is not necessary to obtain publicity for deals in wan-ships by the operation of a Convention.     Furthermore warships are by international usageexempt
10 1 601exempt from examination and rummage by customs authorities, so that&apos; licences would he objectionable and likely to disturb the amenities of nations.The Committee agree with the view expressed in Annex E, that ships of war should be omitted from the Convention, or, failing this,  should be treated in a special Chapter on the lines which the Admiralty recommend.(c) The Air Ministry reasons for wishing aircraft to be excluded from the proposed Convention are given in Annex C. Their main objection is the impossibility of attempting to differentiate between civil and military aircraft.The Committee cannot agree that aircraft should be wholly omitted from the Convention and consider it&apos;desirable that&apos;aircraft should be mentioned in connection with the &quot;Special Zones&quot;  (Chapter III).     A paragraph has accordingly been inserted in Article 8 of Chapter III  (Redraft - Annex A), which provides for the licensing of aircraft when they are destined for those areas,(d) A minor point in connection with the definitions of war material was brought forward by the Colonial Office about &quot;common gunpowder&quot;, the inclusion of which in category III would, give rise to vexatious and unnecessary formalities in the administrative arrangements of some of our Colonies. The Committee consider that :I common gunpowder&quot; may quite well be excluded entirely from the provisions of the Convention, and have amended the draft accordingly.5*   The Export and Transit of Armst Ammunition and Implements of War,.    &quot; g&apos;,, &quot;&quot;&quot;In Article 3 of the Temporary Mixed Commission&apos;s draft there is a provision which provides for the submission of a quarterly, return of licences issued to the Central Intern at i on al&quot;&quot;o ff ice .The Committee consider that a monthly, return would be more satisfactory.    In 3 months an irregular consignment might well have reached its destination without hope of any action being taken, whereas a monthly return might provide information on which a cargo might be seised in transit.T.M.C. draft Article 5.Hew draft       Article 5.The Temporary Mixed Commissions draft of this Article provoked considerable discussion.     It was felt that a.s it stood,  it was too indefinite ana might easily become Rn instrument which an unscrupulous Power might use for gratuitous interference with British shipping.The main purpose of the Convention being to Prevent arms reaching &quot;Special Zones&quot; ,  the Committee take the view that powers of search during transit might well be limited to those consignments proceeding either to the special Zones or to territories under the jurisdiction or tutelage of the authority exercising the power of search.The redraft of Article 5 has been drawn un after consultation with the legal advisers of the Foreign Office.
T.M.C. draft Articles 7 - 9,  )New draft        Article 8- )The Committee are of the opinion that all the Articles relating to export, import and transit of arms, ammunition and implements of war to the &quot;Special Zones&quot; should be grouped in Chapter III,So arranged, the Convention is more compact and easier to follow, and it will lend itself to ratification in part, where a country finds it impossible to ratify the whole Convention although agreeing to a special regime for the Special Zones.Article 7 has accordingly been combined with Article 9 to form Article 8 of the redraft (Annex A), which will begin Chapter III on the &quot;Special Zones&quot;,9*   The Central Internation^T.M.C, craft Article 8.)New draft       Article 7.)The Committee recommend the omission of the last paragraph of this Article shout contracts made before the provisions of the Convention become valid.It was originally inserted in the Temporary Mixed Commission&apos;s draft to cover standing orders between private firms for component parts.      Its retention may call attention to a possible loophole, for the evasion of the conditions of the Convention at the commencement of its operation, as it might result in the placing of a large number of such I contracts before ratification took place.10&apos;   Sjfjbcial, Zones,&apos;T.M.C. Articles 7-9. )New Draft Article 8,      )(a) Article 9 of the Temporary Mixed Commission&apos;^/draftji     iicensing of arjns -and ammunition ,In gateggory II v (* 0 CT.M.C. draft Article 5,    ) .Slew draft       Article 5.    )In redrafting this Article the Committee venture to run entirely counter to the provisions of the Temporary Mixed Commissions draft, for they feel that if this quasi military material is allowed to proceed freely without licence except to the &quot;Special Zones&quot;, very large illicit consignments of anas will continue to reach undesirable parts of the world, just as they do now.     It is found necessary in this country to impose licensing restrictions on the export of sporting, weapons and ammunition to prevent rifles and ammunition clearing home ports without the knowledge of the authorities.     The Committee point out that a licensing system is the only method by which information about the size and destination of a consignment can be obtained.It is therefore recommended that Article S of the Temporary Mixed Commission&apos;s draft be redrafted on the lines-suggested by the Committee,8*   The Export i of Armament to the -^Special- Zones&quot; .
9 9 Q/Atdraft was hardly touched upon by the Temoprary waxed Commission,  so that considerable discussion will take place at Geneva as to what territories and seas should be included in it.      It was one  of the chief tasks of the Inter-Departmental Committee to consider this matter and make recommendations upon it.(b)  In the general discussion on Chapter  III, it was effectively pointed, out by the  India Office that the term &quot;prohibited zones&quot; was an unfortunate one. .    It not only offended the pride of a country lying within the &quot;prohibited, zones&quot; but might lead such a country to believe, quite wrongly, that war material was unobtainable even for its legitimate needs.     The latter is, per contra, far from being the case.     A High Contracting Power can, under  the licensing, system, procure armament just as easily as if its country was not in the Special Zones at all.    The  only effect of its inclusion in the Special Zones is to prevent the internal enemies of the Government from obtaining arms, so that logically a young country governing itself with difficulty should welcome the international support which the Special Zone regime is intended to give,The Committee therefore strongly recommend that the term &quot;prohibited zones&quot; should be discarded in favour of &quot;Special Zones&quot; and urge that the full significance of the Special Zone regime should be brought out as much as possible during, the Geneva conversations.( c ) As stated above  (para e 8 ) , Article 17 and 9 hove been combined to form a. now Article 8 of the redraft dealing with export,  import and transit of all arms, ammunition and implements of war to the Special Zones cThe intention of the Article is that no item defined in Chapter  I shall pass to or through the Special Zones without a license issued by the Government of a iiigh Contract ing Par tyo(d) In pursuance of the Committee&apos;s recommendation about aircraft  (see para.4 (c) above),   it is similarly provided that no  trading in aircraft to the Special Zones shall take place without licence.(e) In recommending the territorial and maritime zones,  the Committee have been guided chiefly by the opinion of the Foreign Office,  India Office and the Colonial Office,  and the old zones of the 1919 Convention of St. Germain.The omission of Persia from the Territorial Zone is the subject of a  special Annex D. written by the India Office.      Every effort is being made to persuade Persia to allow herself to be  included- in the Special Zone.      If these efforts fail, British assent to her exclusion should, only be given on. the conditions specified In Annex D.The Committee considered Egypt&apos;s position in relation to the Convention in general and the Secial Zones in particular.      They are of the opinion that  it would be better if Egypt were a High Contracting Party and not included in the Special Zones.      The reasons for this opinion are given in Annex E.
At Annex IT is a paper by the Foreign Office relating to China, which country is a focus&quot; of the illicit trade in arras and might with advantage figure in this Convention.,Iraq is placed in the Special Zones without conditions, but the Coiavr.ittee hope that the French will be persuaded to allow Syria also to be included, as the absence of Syria might produce a protest from the newly established Iraq GovernmenttThe Maritime Zone calls for no special comment, the only alteration from the 1919 Convention being the substitution of Gwadar for Persia in the Hastern boundary line of the Zone,11.    Land and Maritime Supervision,,^T.ko0. draft - Chapters IT and V. )New draft    -     Chapter III. Parts 2 and 3.  )The provisions for hand and Maritime supervision are contained in Chapters IV and V of the T.M.C. draft. As they are wholly concerned with the Special Zones, the Committee consider that they should form Parts 2 and 3 of Chapter III which would then contain the entire Special Zone regimeoThe Committee found little to notice in the articles on land supervision and left the whole question of Maritime supervision.to the Admiralty, whose remarks on it are. given in Annex GeThe Committee recommend the addition of a phrase at the beginning of the second paragraph of Article 10 of the I0M0C. draft which will have the effect of allowing individuals to land with arms for legitimate personal use without having to go through the &quot;warehouse&quot; procedure.    This addition is shewn in Article 9 of the redraft0The Committee draw attention to Article 13 of the T.M.C0 draft, believed to h...ve been suggested by the Prench, and to which the Committee have made slight alterations, which appear in Article 12 of the redraft,128   General Provisions^T.Mao. draft - Chapter VI.    ))New draft    -     Chapter IV.     )The Committee recommend 2 new general Articles:-(a) An Article designed to exclude from international scrutiny all movements of armament for purposes of imperial defence, and to allow officials and officers to proceed on their lawful occasions carrying the weaponsthey legitimately require.   Tide Article 24 of the&apos; redrafto(b) An Article modelled on the clause usually inserted in technical Conventions negotiated under the auspices/
9 Q K L 0 d8.auspices of the League of Nations.      This is designed to render possible the exclusion from the provisions of the Convention,    other than those relating to control within the special zones, of any Colony, not desiring to &quot;be  bound by those provisions.      The necessity for this Article arises from the constitutional position of Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia which, though not separate Members of the League of Nations,  are fully self-governing,  and of certain   Colonies which are not self-governing but possess Legislatures over which His Mjeety&apos;s Government have no control.      Vide Article 25 of the redraft.The Committee discussed also,  the insertion in the redraft of a new general Article %o make it quite certain that trade in. armament between different parts of the Empire would not be affected by the Convention and that no returns concerning such trade would be required by the Central International office,      It was felt, however, that to insert a specific - clause to this effect in the Convention might possibly throw doubt on this aspect of other international instruments.      The committee therefore, considered that the freedom of Inter-Empire trade in armament had better be left to take care of itself and no addition to the redraft has consequently been made,T.M. 0.  draft - Artlele 25       ))New draft       - Article 26        ]The Committee feel that article 25 of the Temporary Mixed Commission&apos;s draft is not altogether satisfactory. It is unusual for explicit recognition of a belligerent to be made in an ordinary war, since the necessity for such recognition really only arises In cases such as civil war where.there may be some doubt as to the status of one of the belligerents.      In ordinary cases there is merely a proclamation of neutrality.     The article as drafted Is clumsy,  introduces an unusual and cumbersome procedure, and raises unnecessarily the question of recognition of belligerents of doubtful status.     The recognition of &quot;belligerents as such&quot; might be found easy by a country tired of licensing restrictions.The Committee therefore recommend in Article 26 of the redraft a simpler text which is sufficient to meet the purpose and in this connection draw attention to the last paragraph of the Admiralty Annex B relating to warships.T0M0C. draft - Article 52.  )New draft       - Article 32.   )In recommending the. omission of fiussia, the Committee suggest that Czeoho-Slovakia and Holland are worth consideration in replacement of the former country,  as both are interested in the trade in arms, one from the point of view of manufacture and the other of shipping. orm of Linennft.In view of their recommendations in regard to Article 6, Chapter II of the T.M.O. draft,  the Committee
9.have found it necessary slightly to amend the Form of Licence given in the Appendix, so.as to cover transactions other than those made by or on behalf of Governments.8.J.L0VvE.Lieut.-Colonel,  G.S. , Chairman.War Office,23rd April, 19 25.
