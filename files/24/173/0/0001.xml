(ThIB DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET. CABINET  . ^C .P.&quot; 301(25) . ^WATERLOO BRIDGE.Memorandum by the first Commiasloner of Works.My colleagues arc aware of the public controversy which has arisen as a result of the decision of the L.C.C.  to demolish Waterloo Bridge and to ereot a modern bridge in its place.    The decision was reached after examination of the bridge by Mr, Humphreys, the Chief Engineer of the L.C.C., and by two consultants, Mr. Basil Liott (President of the Institution of Civil Engineers), and the late Sir Maurice Pitzmaurice, all of -whom advised demolition on the grounds that under-pinning oould not be successfully carried out and that the operation would be attended by considerable risk to life.The L.C.C. were further influenced by the following considerations: - -(l) That the cost of repair would be very heavy.(2) That the renewal of a considerable proportion of thestonework would be necessary, (a) That the existing bridge is not wide enough to meetpresent-day needs. (4) That a decision to restore the bridge would immediately call forth opposition from the Labour members of the Council and from all those who are more interested in the practical problem of London traffic than in the preservation of a monument. In fact, the contention of the L.C.C. is that the bridge is really worn cut.The present position Is as follows.    A temporary bridge is being put up by the side of Waterloo Bridge, and will be com-ploted,  I understand,  by about the end of July.    The question will then arise of taking down the existing bridge in order to replace it by
by a new structure which will be wider in order to provide for 5 or 6 lines of traffic Instead of 55 lines as at present.    Further, the number of archea will be diminished and the span between them increased so as to avoid the heavy currents and difficulties of navigation which would otherwise be caused by the increased width of the bridge.Representations have been made to me by the Royal Institute of British Architects and by the Architecture Club, both, of which Societies desire that the Government should hold an Independent enquiry Into the question of the preservation of the bridge.    The Royal Fine Art Commission have alao Informed me unofficially that they are strongly in favour of Government inter-vention*    Protests against the demolition of the bridge have been made by the Town Planning Institute, the London Society, and the Society for the Protection of Ancient BuildingsJ and a campaign against the decision of the Lo0o0o ha3 been conducted in the &quot;Times&quot;p the &quot;Morning Post&quot;, the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, &quot;Dally Chronicle&quot;, and many other papers.I will not venture to express any opinion as to whether the bridge could be under-pinned, but I am informed that a similar problem lias been satisfactorily dealt with in connection with a railway bridge over the Rhine at Basle, and also the Stevenson High Level Bridge at Newcastle.    There is undoubtedly a strong body of opinion which holds that the bridge could be restored^ though there is no evidence that the majority of those who have expressed this opinion have conducted an examination on the spot. The L.C0Co have offered to give every facility for Investigation to any responsible bodies and have also expressed their willing-ness to oonsider any fresh evidence which may be brought forward.The Ministry of Transport have referred the question;^ so far as traffic is concerned, to the London Traffic Advisory Committee, who? I understand^ will issue their report this weeks I invite the Cabinet to consider whether the publicInterest
interest in the preservation of Waterloo Bridge is sufficient to justify Government intervention.    I think it quite possible that the L.C.C.might welcome an independent enquiry set up by the Government, but the results of such enquiry from the Government point of view must be considered.      If the Committee agrees with the L-,0.0. that it would not be possible to restore the bridge, then public opinion would be satisfied. If,  on the other hand, the Committee were to report in favour of the restoration of the bridge, the L.C.C might, in vie?f of the considered report of their own experts decline to undertake the rebuilding themselvesj or again,they might ask for a considerable contribution towards the cost of the restoration on aooount of the fact that the Government had, by their own action, declared the bridge to be a monument of national importance.    Further, as the interests of London traffic would be prejudiced by the restoration of Waterloo Bridge.,  the L.C.O, would no doubt be obliged to construct another bridge across the river, and they might contend that the large additional expense involved gave them a still further claim on public funds.It would, of course, be unforunate if the Government could be justly charged with indifference to the opinion of those who regard Waterloo Bridge as one of our finest national monuments, but I am only prepared to urge the appointment of a Committee of Enquiry if my colleagues are fully aware of the financial obligations which nay be entailed,(Intld.) P.8th April,  1935.
