THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) EE 0 R E T. CABINET.r      ^391/25. CASH ON DELIVERY. X.)(Memorandum by the Postmaster General).1.      I desire to establish a Cash on Delivery service in connexion with the inland parcel post, but in view of the hostility to be expected from the retail trades and their Associations, I think it right to obtain the assent of the Cabinet beforehand.2.      An inland Cash on Delivery service was proposed by Lord Derby when Postmaster General in 1902, but was abandoned owing to the opposition of the retail interests.      The service was, however, inaugurated with many of the Crown Colonies, and after the War was extended to India, New Zealand, France, Holland, Belgium, the Scandinavian countries and some other states.     Within those limits it has worked successfully and is rapidly expanding;    in 1924, 217,000 C.O.D. parcols of a value of  565,000 were despatched abroad and 13,000, valued at &quot;  24,000, were received.3.      Cash on Delivery has been a feature in the postal services of nearly every European country for many years and is widely used on the Continent.      A list of the countries with such-an internal service is attached.      In Germany/&quot;some 22-1-million parcels were transmitted CCD. in 1913 and 12-g- million in 1923, the decline being attributed to currency difficulties: in Switzerland the last figures for the CCD. service are 4 million parcels of a value of 72 million francs, in Italy 2f million parcels of a value of 140 million liras, and in Sweden 2,900,000 parcels of a value of 40 million kroner.The
p p*6 &apos;d 3The results in Canada are particularly striking;    the service was introduced in October 1982 and attracted 357,000 parcels in the first year and 667,000 in the second.     The Canadian Post Office report that the opposition of the retailors has been overcome by experience, that they use the service largely and that it is now supported in their trade journals.      The Irish Free State Post Office have started a C.O.D. service, but it has not been in operation long enough to base any inferences upon it.4.      The opposition in this country is based upon the fears of the retail trades that Cash on Delivery will lead to a.transfer of custom from the small village shops to the large urban stores.      I believe these fears to be groundless.    The Cash on Delivery charge, together with the Parcel Postage, will vary from l/- upwards according to the wo   jht and value of the parcel.     If the local retailer cannot compete with this handicap in his favour, the presumption is that the local price is excessive, and in such cases Cash on Delivery would be a useful corrective to local profiteering.      It is significant that the reports from foreign countries shew that the- system, is popular with the small tradesmen by whom it is extensively used..5.      The institution of a Cash on Delivery system has been insistently pressed upon me by the agricultural interests as a means of bringing the farmer into direct touch with the consumer without the intervention of the middle man.      It is also -advocated as a boon to druggists, repair or a and other trades which receive numerous orders by post and telegram, often resulting in bad debts.6.      The administrative machinery for working an Inland Cash on Delivery service is simple;    the cash would be collected,
collected, as is done now in the case of our foj*eigrt otaifvioe, from the addressee by the delivering postman, or if the amount exceeded  5 the addressee would be asked to call and pay at the local Post Offioe.      The money would be remitted to the sender after receipt from the addressee.      The Cash on Delivery fee would be prepaid by the sender in stamps and would be based on an ad valorem scale calculated to yield a sufficient average Revenue to cover the costs, probably an average of 8d. or 9d. por parcel.7.      I do not, however, advocate the establishment of the service In the hope that the POBt Office will derive a large Revenue from the commission charge.      On the contrary I would lay down that, as economies materialise through expansion and experience, the commission charge should be reduced, so as to keep the profit at a minimum.     It Is to the increased user of the telephone, consequent upon the expansion of a Cash on Delivery service, that the Post Office should look for an addition to its Revenue.8.      It cannot be said that there is any general public demand for Cash on Delivery in this country, probably because the individual consumers by whom the service would be used are unimpressed and unorganised, but I believe a service once&quot; instituted would rapidly become popular and might have some effect in steadying retail prices.      I think the alarm of the retail trades would be allayed by experience and, in my opinion their objections should in the general interests be overruled. I know of no reason why a service, which has abundantly justified Itself, both in foreign countries and the Dominions, should be denied to the public of this country because of the opposition of one particular interest.      I should therefore like the authority of the Cabinet to introduce the service at an early date.     No legislation will be necessary.W. M-T.RAL POST OFFICE, LONDON,  3.0.1. 15th June, 1925.
