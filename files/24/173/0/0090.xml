HIS DOCUMENT IS Trig. PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.WIDOWS1, ORPHANST AND OLD AGE CONTRIBUTORY 88(25) *-HBNSIOM5 BILL, 1RET . Copy Hp..,. 9MEMORANDUM BY THB MINISTER OF HEALTH.I have considered the memorandum of the Secretary of-S^fe for War, CP. 283(25).The first point which occurs to me Is that differential arrangements as to contributions by serving men to the social insurance services are wholly anomalous and very difficult to defend.    Accordingly whatever arrangement Is made should be a uniform arrangement for all the services.The precise proposal made is that there should be a consolidated contribution of 7d. for the whole of the insurance services.This contribution has no actuarial basis whatever and the question at once arises how It is to be defended on merits. In so far as it Includes anything for unemployment it would Impose some burden on a soldier recruited from agriculture who on returning to agriculture would not be insured for unem-ployment.The provision of a consolidated contribution of 7d. could not be appropriately made in the Widows&apos; and Orphans&apos; Pensions Bill, since the principle of that Bill as of the other Social Insurance Acts is to provide the specific contri butlon appropriate to the benefits which each confers.     The Bill only modifies the earlier contributions to the extent necessitated by the changes which it Introduces into the benefits of the earlier schemes,If a consolidated contribution of 7d. is to be exacted from&quot; the individual soldier, such contribution Is in effect simply an appropriation in aid of Amy votes and provision
should be made for it In the terms of the agreement with the aoldlor and on those votes.If, on the other hand, the contribution of 7de Is made up of the 4&amp;d. contribution for Widows1 and Orphans&apos; pensions and of other specific sums for Unemployment Insurance and Health Insurance, then such other s-ams should be included in the Unemployment Insurance Bill now under consideration and in the next Health Insurance Bill,(initialled)      N,C.Ministry of Health,June 15th, 1925.
