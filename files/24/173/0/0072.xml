CONFIDENTIAL.[W 4605/2019/94]CABINET.I circulate a memorandum showing the genesis of the conference now sitting in London on sleeping sickness.A. C.Foreign Office, May 21, 1925Memorandum.On the recommendation of the Health Committee of the League of Nations, an expert committee was nominated in 1922 to obtain detailed information regarding the prevalence of sleeping sickness and tuberculosis in Equatorial Africa. At its conference held in London on the 4th September, 1924, the expert committee framed a series of recommendations to the Health Committee suggesting that the latter should entrust to a special mission the study of certain epidemiological problems connected with sleeping sickness in Africa.The Health Committee made the following recommendations to the council: (a.) Administrative Measures.The committee recommended that the Governments of infected countries should afford facilities for conferences between administrators and medical officers on both sides of the frontier. They suggested that it might be desirable to convene a conference of representatives of the various Governments to discuss these measures.(b.) Technical Investigatioms.The committee recommended that certain points might be investigated by research work of local laboratories and of the organisations against sleeping sickness which exist in equatorial regions, and that certain other points might be entrusted to a special mission devoting itself exclusively to the research necessary on the subjects referred to. For this mission to achieve its end, assistance from the administrations of the Governments concerned and adequate funds would be necessary, and the committee suggested that an appeal might be made for this purpose to the League, to the local Governments and to the various institutions interested in the question.These recommendations came before the Council of the League in Rome in December last. The Japanese delegate, who was rapporteur for this question, pointed out in his report that, as regards the administrative measures, it was clear that the Governments of the countries concerned must be consulted. He therefore proposed that the council, while giving their approval to the technical recommendations, should request the Secretary-General to ask the countries concerned whether they would agree to the convening at an early date of a conference of the representatives of the colonial Administrations to discuss the financial and administrative possibility of despatching the special mission recommended by the Health Committee. If such a conference were to take place, it might also discuss the proposed administrative measures.Referring to this part of the rapporteurs report, the British delegate at the council expressed the hope that some further information might be supplied to the Governments as to the scope and place of the enquiry and the expense involved before the colonial Administrations were consulted, and that the Governments would have an opportunity of expressing their opinions on the proposal. The rapporteur replied that 2884 [13136]Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1 925.
it was for the colonial Administrations to submit proposals to their respective Govern-ments before final action was taken.Communications were accordingly addressed by the Secretary-General to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to the French, Belgian, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish Governments. In this conrmunication the Secretary-General enquired whether those Governments would be agreeable to tbe convening at an early date of a conference of representatives of the colonial Administrations to discuss proposals of an administrative character arising out of the Health Committee&apos;s recommendations. It would be the purpose of the conference to determine the scope of these measures and also to consider, from an administrative and financial point of view, the despatch of a small mission of enquiry to carry out a careful study in selected regions of Equatorial Africa of the various problems associated with the epidemiology of sleeping sickness.All the Governments accepted this invitation, and agreed that the conference should meet in London on the 19th May, 1925.
