The matter has recently been brought up again by tbe advertising contractors for the Telephone Directories who estimate that tbe removal of the embargo on liquor advertisements in those publications would increase the advertisement revenue by  10,000 to  20*000 per annum0 Tbe matter has therefore become one of some financial significance, but tbe present Postmaster General does not feel justified in reversing tbe decision of his predecessor without the,, approval of the Home Affairs CommitteeaAs I understand the position,  tbe general principle of accepting liquor advertisements in Government publications has never been in question, and if this be accepted the point is whether there are circumstances in this ease callingI- 1 -.... . . ,,,...1.1. .,,    ...    .......-......................._______.....__________........____.V ._____________r.________L. &quot;.___1 &quot;It._________.....&apos;...*!..      _________*&quot;&apos;..&quot;.*_________..............V.I___________&quot;__l______________ ________............__________S.     &apos;......____*.&apos;..&quot;&apos;.......V..illf
for exceptional treatment.    I am not aware of any such oirournstances save the natural reluctance in a matter of this, character to invite public criticism by a change of policy.But any such criticism would appear to be most improbable. In the first place, as I have already pointed out, liquor advertisements are commonly   admitted to Government publica-tions.     Secondly 1 understand that the present embargo does not extend to Wino and Spirit Merchants but only to specific brands of alcoholic liquors -* a somewhat fine distinction! Thirdly, liquor advertisements are freely   admitted to the London Classified Trade Directory and Buff Boofto      It is trua that the Buff Book is prepared and Issued by a private firm, but it is &quot;Issued with the authority and co-operation of His Majesty xs   Postmaster General&quot; (to quote the title page) subject to payment of a royalty;    copies are supplied and distributed by the Post    Office free to telephone subscribers; they hang side by side with the official directory in many -telephone call boxes and I question whether the general public draws such a distinction between the two directories as to regard tho insertion of liquor advertisements in the official directory as a new departure.(Intd.)
