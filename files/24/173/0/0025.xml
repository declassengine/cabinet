.. see1,       It was agreed to take the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee attached to the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs cf April 28th, 1925, (Cabinet Paper CP. 2l8(25)) as a basic of discussion.The following points were raised and discussed:-2&apos;       (4) Definition of Arms , Ammunition and Implements of War.Warships.LORD CECIL preferred that War Ships should not be excluded from the operation of the Convention, and ashed for a fuller explanation of the objections entertained by the Admiralty to their being included.REAR-ADMIRAL AUBREY-SMITH developed the arguments setout in Annex B tc the Report of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee, and pointed out that if the smallest warshipswere put under the Convention,  it would be impossible todraw a line and exclude larger craft.After considerable discussion it was agreed, that  if it were found necessary at the Conference, the alternative proposal made in Annex B to the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report,  should be accepted.Aircraft.LORD CECIL suggested their inclusion in Category II, but, after hearing an explanation by the Air Ministry representative of the impossibility of differentiating between military and civil aircraft,  did not press this suggestion further.LORD CECIL also suggested that all aircraft should besubject to licence wherever their destination.It was agreed that  if this should be urged by other Delegates at Geneva, the British Delegate should ash for further instructions.3.      (6) Trans it.LORD CECIL suggested the need for stronger provisions for stopping irregular consignments in transit, but did not
O 0 1insist on his view after explanations from SIR SYDNEY CHAPMAN the Board of Trade representative, (10) Special Zones.LORD ONSLOW expressed doubt as to the necessity for Insisting on the inclusion of Abyssinia, hut explained that the Foreign Office view was that Abyssinia should be included.LORD CECIL was disposed to agree, but concurred in the Foreign Office view,LORD CECIL suggested that advantage might be taken of the opportunity of endeavouring to make some outsidearrangement, through the agency of the League of Nations,to strengthen control in respect of Abyssinia.It was agreed that this was desirable,  if possible&quot;, and Mr. McNeill undertook to consult the Foreign Office on the point,China.Some discussion took place regarding the arms embargo to China.It was generally agreed that  it was desirable to do anything possible te limit the supply of arms to that Country, and in particular to see if acceptance of the Washington Resolutions on the subject could be secured.4. (12) New Draft Article 26.LORD CECIL raised the question whether the Articleshould not end with the word &quot;belligerent&quot; instead of&quot;belligerent government&quot;, but was satisfied to accept thedecision of the Leg.al Advisers of the Foreign Office.5. It was agreed that  internal trade or movementof arms, ammunition and implements of war within the Empire were not to be regarded as go-verned by the regulations in the Convention.-&apos;
6.General Conclusion.The Committee agreed,   subject to the above observations, to approve the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee, and to authorise the British Delegate to communicate the amendments to the Draft Convention suggested by that Committee, to other Delegations on arrival in Geneva in the measure which he might think desirable.2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I. 30th April, 192 5.
