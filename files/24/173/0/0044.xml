Afterwards&apos;itwas found that a Bill with this object had actually been introduced into the House of Lords under Mr* Bonar IawTsGovernment and had been passed through that House and sentto the Commons.-,      In these circumstances the Prime Ministerauthorised me to modify the answer which had been suggestedin the Cabinet, which was no longer appropriate, and it wasgiven in reply to Lord Selborne in the following form :-&quot;aooyOur Lordships will remember that a Bill v/ith this object was passed through your lordships House under Mr? Bonar Lawrs Government in 1923, but was not proceeded with In the Eoi*se of Commons-      The matter  . has,  of course, been under the consideration of the present Government again and the Government hope to propose legislation with the same object without delay, after having carefully considered its terms.    I ought to add that,  in the present condition of public business,  I am not sure that I can hold out any great hope that there will bo sufficient time in tho House of Commons for the Bill to pass through all its stages.    So far, however, as this House is concerned, there ought to he no difficulty.&quot;The Bill of 1923 is circulated herewith-    I suggestit should be in the first instance referred to the HomeAffairs Committee.(Int d. )       S,13th May,  1925*
