Annex.CONFIDENTIAL. THE    TRADE    OUTLOOK.
p ii OTHE TRADE OUTLOOK.ENGINEERING.SIR GLYNN WEST,  -&quot;The position is very little more encouraging than when I last reported.Continental competition is even greater than before: as an example, wire rods are now being cffered at  6 per ton f.o.b. Antwerp - which is at. least  2 per ton less than English material - and, In addition, Continental sellers are willing to give almost any concession to obtain the business.    In consequence of this it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep the plants in the heavy steel industry employed, even at the prices which have had to be accepted at a sacrifice in. the past in order that the output might be maintained.    I can only repeat therefore that I fear we shall shortly be faced with a very serious situation unless some assistance can be given to this industry.With regard, to General Engineering, there is little change, but the Locomotive industry shows a slight improvement.In regard to Shipbuilding, I cannot see any improvement, as I feel sure that the orders which have been taken recently are not remunerative.Coal trade reports are no better, and although output has been reduced, production is still in excess of the market requirements&quot;.IRON AND STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR said that the situation was the same as it had been a month ago In the Sheffield trades; there was no improvement.    The Chinese situation was giving a great deal of concern, but so far he had been advised to go on shipping goods, and the last reply he had had from Shanghai was that the situation, so far as Shanghai was concerned, was fairly well in hand.    Generally speaking, it was difficult to pick up any trade, and it was becoming more and more apparent that we are not going to do a great volume of trade at to-day&apos;s prices. We would have to cut down the prices somehow.    The Russian situation was also causing anxiety; and we were allowing Russians to disturb our trade all over the world.    The advantage we got from the slight trade we are doing with Russia in this country is practically nothing, he thought, compared with the damage being done by Russians to our trade in different parts of the world.SIR W. CLARE LEES observed that last month Sir A. Balfour mentioned that there were signs of a considerably growing Russian trade, and of giving credit to a degree which might prove to be dangerous.
CONFIDENTIAL. IRON AND STEEL (contd.).disclosure A. liALPOUR confirmed that these credits have been givon and are still being givenj but that recent difficulties, both the Glasgow incident and the Chinese incident, were making people frightened and holding them back.    The credits were mostly spread over a shipment of one third in three months and a third in six months.    Those terms have been steadied very much by political incidents.MR. DOEMAN said the Stoel trade was in a very depressed condition,  and that outputs were being reduced.    Eleven blast furnaces were put out in April, and there vrere at the end of that month only 1F8 in operation.    From Hay last year to April this year the monthly average output of pig iron was only about 590,000 tons; April, of course, included the Easter holidays.    The figures were lower than the monthly averages of 1913, despite the fact that capacity had been increased by  0$ over 1913j and stocks of pig iron were continuing to accumulate,  in spite of the number of   furnaces which had been put out of action.   Galvanised sheets were fairly good, and constructional steel work also.   The most disquieting feature was the enormous increase in imports of Iron and Steel.    They were now almost equal to the exports whereas in 1913 the exports were more than double the imports.He added his firm had proved on a number of occasions, sometimes for an odd month when they could scrape up enough orders to go full, that their practice was considerably better to-day than it had been in the past few years.    They were quite confident, if it were possible to get orders,  thoy could deliver the goods on a cheaper conversion cost than they had been able to in the whole history of the trade previously,    He did not, however,  say a cheaper total cost, because other factors, which were beyond their control, entered into it,  such as railway rates, which were very heavy, and coal.MR. BAKER : -&quot;I have nothing to report of an encouraging nature. There seem a to be no improvement in the heavy iron and steel trades,    The United States are said to be working round about 70 per cent capacity, which is a big drop during the present year.&quot;COAL,SIR ADAM NIMMO said that the figures showed that output was slowly but steadily falling.   The output for the week endeo. 23rd May represented in round figures practically 174,000 tons less than for the previous week, 578,000 tons less than the corresponding week in 1924, and 800,000 tons less than the output for the corresponding week in 1913.   As against 1924, assuming we could mark time on these figures we would be down nearly 29 million tons, and something like forty million tons as compared with 1913.    The export quantities were down in round figures something like seven hundred thousand tons for April, which is the latest figure we had, as compared with April, 1924.   Further, the value of the quantity exported had fallen by nearly  1,75 0,000 in April 1925,   as compared with April 1924, and there is an average fall in realised values for the export trade of practically 4/2 a ton.
COAL (Oontd.) ,The     present       figure, no doubt, was substantially below that, because present values were relatively lower than the average figure that is represented, by that result; and the new business,  if it could be  accepted at all, would be certainly at substantially lower figures still, so that looking at the position broadly,  it looked like this,  that we were having to deal in coal with an entirely new range of values.    It was also quite clear to anyone who had a broad interest in the industry that we were not really at the bottom of the decline yet.We must in some way or other get the cost of production of coal brought into line with that new range of values. He agreed that the real problem was how to reconcile an economic cost in an industry like the coal industry with the cost of living, but it was not the employer in the coal industry who was going to apply the pressure which was evidently going to come about if the industry was going to be carried on. It was a serious set of economic factors which no individual or group of individuals could possibly expect to stand up against. Therefore it seemed that whatever might be said from the point of view of the cost of living,   if this industry - and Sir A,Nimmo thought the sa;.:e was true of all the big industries in the country     was to go on at all,  the whole of us would have to get down to a much simpler form of living.    The money was not going to be there, to maintain the standard of living in the country, and the choice would have to be ultimately,  it seemed to him, between accepting a simpler form of living or doing awajr with the trade altogether.    In the coal industry probably more than in any other we had really no control over the price.    If we were to do the trade we had to take the price that the world would give us, and we had to meet competition from every coal producing country in the world,    He did not know how the situation was going to be worked out. It would require to be dealt with with enormous care and with enormous prudence and wisdom, but no amount of prudence, wisdom and care will get over the fundamental facts which are confronting us, particularly in this Industry to-day; and however regrettable it was, he thought that in the immediate future this Industry was going to present to the country one of the most difficult and one of the gravest problems that it had been called upon to face and dispose of.COLONEL WILLEY said that he had found that,  in a. large group of textile mills, the coal consumption in the past three months has been less than one-third of what it was a year ago.    That was how the textile trade affected the coal trade.
Q 9 Qo if qCOAL    (Contd.)SIR ADAM NIMMO    added that it looked a3 if ooal would ultimately have to provide iron and steel and other dependent industries with very nearly half of the out they want to make to put them on a real competing basis, but everything else would have to be brought into line,  in the matter of transport charges and other directions, if the other half was to be made good.     If that position could be brought into being over the coiintry as a whole, he thought the worker would be in a better position;    although he was receiving a lower wage the purchasing power of that wage would steadily improve.EL3CTRIGAL ENGINEERING.SIR H. HIRST   was glad to be able to strike a different note in regard to his branch of industry.     It had benefited from orders at home,  placed,  in particular, in respect of Power Stations where an endeavour was being made to over-take arrears of work deferred from the war period or immediately after.     The industry had also recently obtained some substantial railway contracts from South Africa, India and Australia.      The prices for these contracts had not been very good, because there had been foreign competition to contend with in each case, but the home Industry had secured the contracts.   Employment in consequence is rather larger than normal.TEXTILES:    COTTON.SIR W CLARE LEES    stated that the position in the cotton trade in Manchester was very much what it was the last time he reported.      He thought, that the tendency Is for order books to get lighter and for there to be less on order, but the machinery was employed at about the same as it was before.     The section of the trade suffering most was the unfinished goods,&apos;    the finishing sections were better employed.      The bleaching section was, however, probably better employed than either of the other two at the moment, and the present position seemed quite hopeful in that end of the trade.
TEXTILES:    COTTON (Contd. )Last year the world was waiting at this time of the year, just as it was now, with a view to knowing what is going to happen in the crop position.    But last year, when there was a considerable increase in the cotton crop and a considerable fall in price, the world did not get the advantage cf it, because prices had been so severely cut previously that the whole of the drop in cotton was absorbed in rectifying those losses.    The position to-day was that those losses did not exist to the same extent, and in many cases did not exist at all, and he believed that any movement of crop and price would be fairly closely represented in the movement of prices in selling abroad.    If we had another tendency downwards, it might result in a definitely increased trade over last year.He thought that they were slowly and steadily Improving their position.    If they could use a wider range of cotton it would, be very much better for them, and they were making practical experiments.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN wrote on 21st May, - &quot;The Cotton Trade still continues to be In a depressed, state,&quot;in the American section of the trade short time Is still being worked and any margin of profit which lately existed on coarse and medium yarns has now practically disappeared.&quot;Violent fluctuations in the cotton market, chiefly of a downward tendency, have shaken the confidence of buyers, and there is no doubt that, even in spite of short time, the production of yarn is to-day in excess of the requirements. Cotton has steadied somewhat and more inquiry has come out but actual business finding Its way into the Mill Order Books is very unsatisfactory.&quot;in the Egyptian Section, trade is now much worse than it has been for a long time, and spindles have even begun to stop for want of orders in this section.&quot;it has been seen from &quot;the papers that Germany proposes to revise her tariffs and that she proposes to double the existing tariffs on English fine count yarns,   At the moment of writing we know nothing officially of this, but should it be the case, our trade will view with the very greatest alarm this additional obstruction to Lancashire1 s trade.y
COINCIDENT I AL.TEXTILES: COTTON (Contd. )&quot;it is to be greatly hoped that any revision of Tariffs by Germany will be at any rate accompanied by the removal of Import prohibitions which are to-day seriously interfering with British trade to Germany.11 The condition of the Cloth trade is also very unsatis-factory, the disturbed condition of China is causing business from that market to be unsatisfactory.    India is not buying in the quantity that might be expected and Continental markets are still handicapped by depreciated exchange and inability to establish satisfactory credits.&quot;Looms at the moment are fairly well engaged, but I am afraid that If cloth business does not improve quickly, looms will soon begin to empty again&quot;.TEXTILES: WOOL.COLONEL WILLEY said that the unemployment in the wool textile trade had increased, and mills throughout the West Riding of Yorkshire were dropping down from four to three, and even two, days a week.   There is the disquieting feature that orders had been placed a year ago    or so, which there was no inclination to^take up, and this only emphasized what Sir Thomas Allen pointed out, namely, that the purchasing power in this country was falling.   Referring to what Sir Arthur Balfour said with regard to our imports, and coupled with the report Sir Thomas Allen gave about purchasing power, it had to be remembered that the wool retained in this country in the first four months of this year was less by a third than the pre-war average   for the same period, which showed that consumption was falling considerably, and that applied also to the exports, which were down.    The wool con-sumption of the world, was, in fact, falling off rapidly.    One got the best evidence of it in America; it was more marked&quot; there than in Europe, and of the total expenditure of money the proportion which was spent on wool textiles was falling rapidly compared with what was spent on food and, probably, moter cars.MR. ANDREWS, -&quot;As regards the position of trade in the Wool Textile Industry - there has been no improvement during the month, but at any rate trade is no worse.   A month ago there were slight signs of a return of confidence, but I regret to say-that this did not develop, and the lack of confidence in prices is still the determining factor in buyers refraining from the placing of orders.* See page 15.
(C 0NFID5NTIAL , TEXTILES:    WOOL (Contd).&quot; Wool combing machinery is not employed to more than 40$ capacity - spinning is a little better than combing but without any improvement on the month.    I think, however, that the under-production of the last four or five months is beginning to tell a little on the bareness of stocks of wool clothing, and that probably the manufacturers are a little better to-day than they have been for some time.&quot; Now that wool prices are on a reasonable level a restoration of confidence would immediately bring out many orders being held back.&quot; I am of opinion that the restoration of the Gold standard -while it will probably be a benefit in the future - at the moment and probably for some little time to come it is, having a depressing influence upon our section of the trade.TEXTILES: WORSTEDS ETCMR. 3UTCLIPFS SMITH said that the state of the manufacturing section in the Bradford District was still deplorable.   They were only running about forty-five per cent of the looms, but it was felt that there is a little more hope for the future, as people were beginning to feel that prices of the raw materials were approaching stabilisation.    In the meantime he agreed with Colonel Willey that home and foreign buyers were holding off and awaiting the result of the wool sales in July, and orders were only being given sparingly from hand to mouth.    In the spinning trade the mills were producing sixty-six per cent, of the normal, but they were having a great difficulty in obtaining business,  and they would not improve until there is a more definite stabilisation in raw materials prices.   The first week in June showed an increase of men, totally unemployed of 2,000 over the last week in May.CHEMICALS.MR, FERRY - &quot;From the Information at my disposal I am inclined to think that no material change has taken place in the Chemical Industry since the last Council meeting.    The unemployment percentage figure has not increased, and the consumption of the index commodity Sulphuric Acid has remained at about the same figure as last quoted.&quot;The Chemical Industry has endeavoured to strike a more popular and less technical note this year at its section at the British Empire Exhibition, which is I think proving beneficial from the point of view of both the public and the Industry&quot;.
FOOD INDUSTRIES.In connection specially with the food industries, MR. MACHIN said that in the homo market they were perhaps not going back, but they were not going forward, and there was a want of life and of confidence which was not re-assuring.     So far as the export trade is concerned there was a distinct falling off during the past month.     This was not to be wondered at in view of the ever-increasing difficulties put in their way in the form in some cases of increased tariffs, and In other casos of restrictions and ^ difficulties which had the same effect as tariffs, and tended to make export more difficult and in some cases almost impossible.     Ha could not agree with SIR THOMAS ALLEN (see page9)that the demand for food products shows a tendency to concentrate more on the highest class goods.     His experience was rather the reverse,POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS   said that there had been depression in the home trade for some time, but it was pleasing to know that this month there had boon a slight increase in the trade with the United States,     The increase of unemployment up to the 8th June had been 1% over last year.     That is, 18.6^ as compared with 11.6.     He was given to understand that 80$ of that increase consisted of part-time workers.MR. Holltns. also referred to the present classification of pottery in the Trade Accounts, which had recently formed the subject of a deputation to the Board of Trade,      It appearod that considerable quantities of what was known in tho Trade as translucent pottery was being returned as &quot;Earthenware&quot; instead of  as &quot;China&quot; and thus the import figures for the two groups in April of this year were given as 573 tons of &quot;Translucent pottery&quot; and 29,000 tons of &quot;General Earthenware&quot;,     But when the operatives quoted these figures to the employers, they were told that the actual importations of china were much greater, with the result that the issues were confused and the operatives joined with the employers in asking that the classifications should be revised.The President agreed that the matter should be cleared up, and it was in fact being considered in consultation with the Customs.GENERAL TRADE.SIR T. ALLEN felt sometimes that perhaps not enough, care and attention was given on a Council like this to constructive policy.     Rather than simply reporting how we find things month by month, we might see whether we could not devise some-thing that would be helpful, and do what Sir Arthur Balfour and others want done, and yet give the purchaser some hope.
CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL TRADE  (contd.).SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR remarked that the statistics they had had on the Committee on Industry and Trade - speaking from memory - were that last year we imported in foodstuffs 125 as against 100 pre-war, in volume, not in value: and raw materials 90 as against 100; whilst our exports of finished products were only about 79 against 100.   He agreed with Sir Thomas Allen, but we were consuming foodstuffs and clothing and so on, without producing any kind of equivalent to match the consumption.THE PRESIDENT drew attention to the table   which hv.d been prepared in the Board,    in which the 1913 basis of prices nad been ta&amp;en to show the volume of our export trade in manufactures,  our imports of manufactures,  the retained imports of raw materials and the export of coal.    The only satisfactory element about that is the very steady rise over the course of the last six months of the retained imports of raw materials.SIR ALAN ANDERSON said he did not quite understand Sir Thomas Allen when he was speaking of the increased cost of living.   According to the figures he had, the cost of living was almost exactly the same in the early months of this year as in the early months of last year.THE PRESIDENT asked whether Sir Thomas would say that the very big fall in sugar accounted for a good deal.SiR THOMAS ALLEN agreed.    Sugar was now at about its lowest point.    He did not know what would have happened with the figures if sugar had been anything like what it was last year.THE PRESIDENT pointed out that the Board of Trade indox number of wholesale prices for May 1925, was 159.0 as compared with 163-7 for May,  1924; while for food alone,  the present index was 5-.4 above the corresponding figure for last year.SIR THOMAS ALLEN said that he was going on actual invoice prices on a month&apos;s business compared with twelve months ago, taking the actual wholesale cost prices and the actual retail prices.    He added that the tendency was to get, where possible, the very best class of food, because the thrifty housewife knows that the better the commodity the more economical it is.COLONEL WILLEY said that the picture of the state of trade in general given in the reports of the Federation of British Industries was no more encouraging than it had been last month, and perhaps one would be justified in saying that it was more discouraging.    Part-time employment in many trades had tended to increase;  the general inclination among customers was to postpone buying:  and indeed the opinion appeared to be general throughout the trading community that a process of deflation of currency was going to be carried out, accordingly they looked for a deflation of commodity values - which should be accompanied by some deflation in cost of services - and we got the postponement of purchases as a natural result.    That general tendency seemed to be reflected in moat Industries, and it meant an increase   of mere hand to mouth buying,  a policy which was started in the United States 2% years ago. Bankers in the States had been forced to pay a great deal of attention to it, and it was spreading in this country; further, the unsettlement of continental currencies was assisting to make people apprehensive about buying.
GENERAL TRADE (Contd.).MR. GALLACHER, referring to high-priced goods, remarked that Sir Thomas Allen and Mr. Maohin disagreed.   He thought they were both right from their own points of view.    In Scotland it was found that when workmen were in steady work there was a demand for the better-priced goods, but when the men were on the dole, and the income was reduced fifteen per cent, or more, it was quite impossible that they could obtain these higher priced goods and they must fall back on a cheaper quality.In regard to this Counoil doing something more definite than hitherto, he certainly would support that idea,    ^or instance, had the silk manufacturere and the people interested in this country been consulted before taxes were proposed, it might have saved the Government much in the way of making apologies, admissions, and so on, and there seemed to be no reason why what was said there should not form a basis of further discussion and help to remove some of the difficulties under whioh they:were labouring. He thought something might be done along those lines.MR. MACHIN regretted that he had very little cheering news to communicatej in fact he felt that the position to-day was worse than It was when the Counoil met last.    The Chambers of Commerce were concerned at the state of our national expenditure;  they were awaiting the outcome of the inquiry which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had promised to make into this matter; and if an interim report of the Colwyn Committee, which had been sitting for many months, could be issued,  it might re-assure the trading community.AU S TfiALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON said that this was a quiet season of the year for Australia as a rule.    The season was fairly good. The two outstanding Items of interest there had been the drop In the price of wool and the exchange rate.    The very heavy fall in the price of wool had revived some of the old ideas about control and a good many discussions were going on now partly with a view to dealing with the remnant of the clip which still remained to be realised,  and partly with a view to considering what may be done with the next one, but so far nothing very definite had emerged.    In regard to exchanges, there had been considerable fluctuations in these during the past few years, owing to fluctuations in the price of products and also to the large sums of money whioh had been borrowed from this country, but to-day the position practically was that the Australian   was on a par with the English sovereign instead of being, as it had been for some time past, at a considerable premium.    There was a small item in connection with wine that might be of interest.    A considerable demand was in evidence here for Australian sweet wines, and negotiations were going on for its export to this country.    The proceedings of the Imperial Economic Committee had been watched with some interest and their report was being awaited with considerable interest.
NEW ZEALAND TRADE.SIR JAMES ALLEN said that there was a slight over-production in the woollen mills in New Zealand, which had to he cleared off, but It was nothing very material.   As to the Control Boards, the Dairy Board was not to come into operation until August next year, and It was Intended to work in harmony with the dairy industry here.   A British representative might be put on the Board to act for it In this country.INDIAN TRADE.MR, LINDSAY said that the chief interest in India centres at present in the weather situation.   The rain which is usually expected in January, did not fall much In North India, and the wheat crop had suffered in consequence.   Again in May, whioh was usually expected to be a dry month, there were several showers earlier than expected, and now on came the report of the breaking of the monsoon in Bombay on the 2nd June about a week earlier than expected.   That might have a serious effect, because the three factors they looked for in the monsoon are firstly sufficiency in volume, secondly in distribution, and thirdly in duration.   The third was almost always the most important of the three, because a monsoon extending to the end of September assures the Spring crop, and if it stopped a fortnight, or even a week too early, that would make a great deal of difference to that crop.    It was too early yet to prophesy, but India as a whole was expecting a poor monsoon this year, for the reason that they had four good monsoons during the past four years.   A poor monsoon would affect India&apos;3 purchasing power this year;   on the other hand, the carry over in almost all the orops   was very good, and India always looks on her gold supplies as an insurance against a bad year, so that if by any chance the balance of trade swung against India there was no doubt that the gold would assist her to maintain the volume of her overseas purchases.The jute crop was bad last year and the year before,  and the plentiful sowings going on now had been encouraged by the high prices.   They expected even as much as a 10 million bale crop as against 8 millions last year, and this would bring prices down.With regard to tea, the slump which had occurred in the last two months had undoubtedly encouraged the tendency to pluck fine in the gardens, and he thought that would have a good effect on the situation as a whole.   With reference to the discussion in the House of Commons the day before on the tea situation, It was Interesting to note that the production for export and consump-tlon of tea were not, as some seemed to think, in excess of what they were pre-war.    India, Ceylon, and Java had Increased their crops, but not enough to offset the reduction in China&apos;s exports, so that the world production of tea for export this year was actually very slightly less than it was in 1913,
CONFIDENTIAL. FAR EASTERN TRADE,MR. LANDALE said that only a small business in imports of Manchester goods was being transacted in Shanghai; and, in the south, Chinese dealers were having great difficulty in marketing their purchases made during the winter, owing to the unsettled state of the country.    In Engineering there was very little doing.    In exports from China business was very restricted.   As regards the Railways, the Shanghai -Nanking Railway was gradually recovering, the Tientsin -Pukow Railway was still almost entirely in the hands of the military and traffic was very restricted.   The Peking -Mukden Railway was still very much Interfered with by troop movements.On the 27th July, 192.3, at the Annual Meeting of the China Association, the following Resolution was unanimousJLy * passed and forwarded to the Foreign Office:-&quot;That this Meeting is of opinion (a) that the hopes and intentions of the Governments signatory to the Four Power Treaty at the Washington Conference with regard to peace and good order in China have not been fulfilled;  (b) that the time has now been reached when those Governments should review the state of affairs in China with a view to considering, measures by which. China may be assisted in achieving national union,  settled conditions,   and financial equilibrium;  (c) that these objects may best be attained by enlarging the scope of the Special Conference which is to be oonvened for considering the Customs surtax and the abolition of Likin, but if circumstances prevent that body meeting in the near future, a special Conference be convened by the Four Powers to this end.&quot;Mr. Landale could only repeat the advice given in this Resolution and express the hope that there would be no further delay in calling together a Special Conference to consider the position.   Just before this recent outbreak his political advices from Peking were a little more hopeful. He understood that this Customs Conference was to be convened, in the Autumn,   It would be better if it could be convened at once.MR. SUTCLIFFE SMITH said there was almost a complete stoppage of the export business to China,  including the suspension of the Chinese textile auctions, and he thought the situation in China wanted pretty firm handling.   Japanese competition with our goods in China was serious; in fact, they were placing cotton goods on the market there, in very large quantities, at prices with which we were absolutely unable to compete.   The prices  were so low, that they could hardly to due to the lower costs of labour alone, and he should be interested to know whether the Japanese Government subsidise their textile industry.THE PRESIDENT promised to try and ascertain that. He said that, in view of Japanls financial position, it would be very surprising if it were  so.
S47FAR eastern TRADE (Contd.)MR. SUTCLIFFE SMITH added that our own trade vdth Japan was proving very difficult, and the normal amount of orders was not coming through.   Some of our Eastern merchants had been asked by their customers, the Indians particularly, if they would, have their well-known British cloths, styles that they have sold for years, made in Italy, sent over here and then re-exported, because the Italians make so much cheaper.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE .ib.. HOSE - &quot;General conditions in the principal South American markets have shown no important change since the beginning of May last.   In Brazil, although the political situation is not yet entirely free from anxiety, no serious disturbances have been reported, and an improvement during the past few weeks in the demand for coffee from the United States has imparted a more reassuring tone to the market.    In the course of his Message at the opening ef Congress on 3rd May, the President of Brazil, Dr. Bernardes, expressed the hope that the Republic would be able to continue the improvement in her national finances without recourse to further borrowing abroad.    So far as the future development of the Republic&apos;s enormous potential resources is concerned, however, this cannot be fully undertaken without the introduction of. foreign capital, which will not be forthcoming until confidence in the general situation and the credit of Brazil is fully restored,&quot;The national finances of Chile benefited in the first quarter of the current year by increased receipts from export duties resulting from the expansion in export trade, and are likely to undergo further considerable improvement as a result of the pending additional sales of nitrate-bearing grounds which are announced to take place in September next.    The income from these sales will substantial-ly brighten the prospect of a Budget surplus being realised for the current year, for at the last auction of nitrate grounds in September last, bidding was very keen, and a sum in excess of 2 0,000,000 gold pesos  ( 1,5 00,000) was realised.    Judging by the receipts from import duties in Chile, which, during the first quarter of 1925, were about 7% in excess of those for the corresponding period of 1924, the import trade of the Republic Is expanding slowly, but it Is very difficult to see how any substantial expansion in buying from abroad can occur until the exchange rate is stabilis ed.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRAPS (contd).&quot;Cereal shipments from Argentina continue to be held up, the uncertain conditions in European and North American markets being a ruling factor.   Wool shippers are also awaiting greater stability in the price level, but, with regard to both these commodities,  it must be borne in mind that the reticence of buyers in recent months has doubtless created a considerable potential demand which must make itself felt as soon as some measure of confidence is restored. The outstanding feature of the Argentine markets a month or so ago was the shortage of currency, which restricted the trade movement usual at that time of the year, although the Government adopted special measures which alleviated the situation.    The effect of thia restriction was felt in Imports from all sources and was not confined to goods of British origin.&quot;British textile and clothing manufacturers have more. . than held their own in Argentine markets during the past few months.   There are, however, large stocks of imported woollen and cotton goods available, owing to the limited sales which have recently taken place.    The strongest competition in cotton goods of the lower grades comes from Italy, whilst, owing to American competition, English producers have lost ground in yarns for use in the local hosiery trade.    The movement in British artificial silks has also been restricted owing to the lower prices quoted by Belgian, Dutch and Italian producers.&quot;Generally speaking, the feeling in trade circles in Argentina continues to be optimistic,  and it is believed that, as soon as shipments of grain assume normalm proportions, a marked revival in trade will result.&quot;BANKING.MR, TEN MANT said that the report from our Branches  shows that things are very much as they were last month, if anything a trifle worse, particularly in the coal trade, and, it would seem,  in the iron trade.    With regard to money matters,  the deposits of the Banks, the 10 Clearing Banks were down 8l millions on the month, and the loans were about 1 million up. There had been considerable stringency in the short money market.    The market for Trustee 3tocks had been very bad., owing; Mr. Tennant thought,  to the indigestion caused by so many of these issues not having been taken up;    they were of course,  in the hands of underwriters who probably had to sell stocks to meet their liabilities.    It was satisfactory to notice with regard to the Gold standard,  that the gold at the Bank of England had gone up by l! millions since April 28th,MR. PEASE was of opinion that there was still the same, or even an increased, depression In the coal and iron trades;    and no appreciable forward movement in other branches of Industry.     There had been considerable fluctuations in the Money Market in regard to rates.
CONFIDENTIAL. BANKING  (Contd.).The withdrawal of nearly 3 millions of gold for abroad, mostly in small amounts, had caused a considerable tightening in the discount rates in the early part of the month, and the payments for the Conversion Loan added to that stringency.    Subsequently, the purchase of gold in fairly large amounts converted the efflux of gold into a substantial influx, and in spite of the fact that that flow of gold here was not dependent upon the gold impor;  point having been reached,  the market, Mr. Pease thought, was so surprised and pleased at seeing thijaH*tendency of gold to oome here that it did not bother itself very much with the circumstances surrounding the purchase of the gold, but promptly put the discount rate down to below 4*1$.    The June distribution of dividends made a further^drop in the rates, bo that Treasury Bills were sold at 4 V16$.    It was rather interesting to see the view that the Stock Exchange had taken in regard to the movement of gold.    When we first came back to the Gold Standard It would probably not have surpx-iaed the Stock Exchange if there had been a loss of a good many millions of gold, and the fact that we were up on balance would,- one would have thought -, have improved the price of gilt edged stocks considerably, but there   were factors on the other side, as Mr. Tonnant had pointed out? many recent issues had been undigested by the public, there was a fear of- considerable demands from would-be borrowers, Colonial and otherwise,  in the future,  and we were not many months from the ordinary seasonal demands for the purchase of cotton&apos; and so on.    The position of London as the provider of loans seemed to be very difficult at the present time.    There appeared to be many would-be borrowers and it would not appear that London was in a position to supply:/anything like their wants.    It would be desirable from an Imperial point of view, no doubt, if London could supply the whole of what Africa, Australia, and others require, but from the returns relating to the savings of the people and the money available in that way for lending, it would seem that Australia, South Africa, and other parts of the Empire cannot satisfy their needs here, without causing a very serious effect upon our own position and the requirements of our own trades here.CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES.SIR THOMAS ALLEN observed that Sir Arthur Balfour had said that prices generally would have to come down.    In that connection thwre was another aspect of the case, namely the one from the consumer1 a point of view.    Sir Thomas had found that there was a substantial increase of 15$, over the corresponding period of last year, in the Co-operative Societies&apos; monetary turnover in essential food stuffs, and when he came to analyse the figures he found, for example, that butter was up on the year 12fo in wholesale price, flour 35$, bacon 44$, lard 26$,  cheese 18$, while tea was a little bit down,  about 6$,  and sugar 46$
CONFIDENTIAL. CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES (Contd.).down on last year.    These were wholesale prices and they were not altogether passed on to the consumer yet, for the retail advances were found to work out on butter at 9$, flour 30$, bacon 55??, cheese 13$, tea Zf and a reduction on sugar of 43%.    While this cost of living (and all these were essential articles, imported articles, mainly not obtainable or grown in our own country), while these continued to advance in this way, and we were becoming more and more consumers and less and less producers, he did not see how we could deal with the problem very effectually unless we looked at it from both point of view.    It seemed impossible to bring the cost of manufacture down while the cost of living goes up.THE PRESIDENT asked whether, making allowance for price movements, he would say that the purchasing power of the public was steady, or was diminishing or Increasing.SIR T. ALLEN;replied that, as regards quantities, the sales of essential foodstuffs were fairly stable, but when we came to what were called the allied departments, - drapery, woollens and furnishing, - we found there was a decrease, indicating that the consumer must concentrate on the purohase of food, and the other things were left.    Boots, which were an essential commodity showed an increase, but olothing, ready-made, and general drapery, decreased.    It seemed that even the best type of workman and working class family was pretty hard pressed with the low rates of wages and the increasing cost of living, - and it was, he thought, the better class of worker who was mainly associated in the oo-operative movement.MR. GALLACHER observed that since last month things had got rather wor^e in Scotland in the consuming world.    He reported five weeks ago that they had had a slight increase of two and a half per oent.    That had gone down considerably and lie thought they were lucky to finish the half year all square.    The reason was in the continued depression in the coal trade.    Their retail managers reported that in the coal distriots people were unable to buy very much, and even in the distriots where things were fairly good the managers were buying very short, and consequently the wholesale trade was considerably diminishing.   Even in groceries there was a depression, but in drapery there was a very large decrease and in boots.    Y\fools of all kinds were going down in price, which was due, he thought, to the decrease in consumption. He had taken out the figures for the twenty-two weeks of this year and oompared them with the corresponding periods in the preceding years baok to 19S1 and had found their sales of knitting wool had fallen from  77,000 in 1921,  60,000 in 1922,  50.000 in 1923, a slight increase in 1924, down to  28,000 in 1925.    That had been,  to some extent, at the expense of an increase in sales of silk and artificial silk knitting yarns whioh for the same period 1921, were slightly over  5,500;  6,000 in 1922;  8,000 in 1923;  16,500 in 1924 and a decrease in 1925 to  14,000.    There had been during these years a tremendous increase in the sale of silk and artificial silk in ladies&apos; xmderclothing and hosiery,^ which are now made of silk and artificial silk yarn at the expense of wool.    This would be lessened by the excise tax on silk and artificial silk proposed by Mr. Churchill in his Budget.
G 0 NP IB ENTIA L.BUILDING-    TRADES.MR. GALIACHER said that sometimes some of their building undertakings are retarded because of the difficulties of obtaining labour.   About a fortnight ago the County Council of Lanark had all their men taken out by the Building Operatives Union because they were building Weir houses. About three hundred men were taken out, practically every one of them was absorbed the next day, so the County Council of Lanark has lost its labour, building was held, up and the labour had gone into other channels, showing the dearth of labour in those trades.SIR HUGO HIRST said that at his Company&apos;s Coventry works they were considering whether they should carry on extensions in Coventry or in some other town because in Coventry labour was not available.RAILWAYS.MR. HILL stated that the latest railway results brought us up to the 31st May.    They therefore included a part of the Whitsuntide traffic, which was not included in last year&apos;s results for the corresponding period.   As far as passenger receipts were concerned, for the first 22 weeks of this year there was an increase of 3%, but the result of the preceding weeks rather suggested that that increase would not have been more than 2% but for the introduction of theWhltsuntide traffic.   With regard to merchandise, receipts over the first 22 weeks of the year, compared with the same period of last year, were 3)o down. . A month ago they were 2% down.    The aggregate of passenger and merchandise figures showed a decrease of 1%   representing a decline In receipts of nearly  450,000.   With regard to particular articles,, the latest available figures of tonnage were those for March, which showed a falling off, as compared with March last year, of 6.4$ op rather over 2 million tons.    The chief decrease had been in coal, which accounted for nearly if- million tons of the decrease.    Iron and steel traffics had also fallen off considerably, and the only important trades which showed increases were, again, the building trades and. road stone. In the other articles of merchandise for which figures were available, traffics were relatively light and the variations from last year&apos;s figures were not so great.UNEMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS observed that the latest figure of the unemploy-ed on the live register on 25th Hay numbered 1,186,500.    On 27th April it was practically the same figure viz:- 1,187,000. As contrasted with the figure of about a year ago, at the end of May, 1924, the latest figure showed an increase of about 170,000 which is subject to the reduction of 70,000 or so, to make it comparable with -last year&apos;s figure.      There was
UNEMPLOYMENT  (C ontd .) .an increase of very nearly 61,000 for 2nd June, which was Whit Tuesday, and that figure no doubt represented, very largely, suspensions over the holidays,,   It was a normal practice, in depressed trades where workpeople were working short time, for the employers to take the opportunity of giving the workers rather a longer holiday than usual, with the result that the unemployment figures went up.   Normally the people concerned were absorbed into employment again during the next few weeks. In answer to the President, Mr. Phillips said that in shipbuilding the unemployment was between 2 and 3 per cent, more than a year ago, though in this last month it had gone down somewhat.- . THE MOND SCHEME.COLONEL WILLEY said that the question of unemployment subsidies,  referred to at the last meeting, had been further explored by the Federation of British Industries, and the previous Impression of the impossibility or impropriety, of working along the lines of the Mond Scheme has only been emphasized.    If anything was to be done it should be done by way of a direct subsidy, which would be determinable at any time, for a specific contract; and, broadly, you would be subsidising the order rather than the labour *In connection with the subsidies which had been referred to, Mr.MACHIN said that the Association of Chambers of Commerce discussed Sir Alfred Mondls scheme last week, and the unanimous opinion was that while in theory it was somewhat inviting,  in practice it was absolutely unworkable.ARTIFICIAL SILK DUTIES.MR. SUTCLIFFE SMITH said he would like to refer to the artificial silk position.   He entirely stuck to the statement he made to the President last month that the excise tax on artificial silk was a menace to our-export trade.    It would cause the exporter to be surrounded with a series of certificates and restrictions of all sorts, which had a psychological effect and made him say he would not be bothered with the trade.   The consequence would be that Italy, which had no such restrictions, would quote to the very customers we wanted to sell the goods to, and in years to come it would have a serious effect on our trade.   Our textile    I exports were forty-eight per cent, of the wholly or mainly manufactured class of British exports, and he thought it unwise to harass in such a way so great a proportion of our export trade. take the Dyestuffs Prohibition Act; that caused a great increase in the price the textile trade had to pay for its dyewares.   For some years we had been paying l/4d*&quot; a pound for indigo, while Germany, America and Switzerland have offered it to us at 8d a pound.   He thought the total consumption by Great Britain of indigo was only about 1,750 tons, but it affects millions of pounds worth of goods; that is where the seriousness comes in.    If these additionalThe present price of Indigo is lid. a lb. and there are percentage reductions ranging from \$ to 13 $.
AR TIFICIAL SILK DC TIES  (Contd.),restrictions were put on, he thought in years to come we should look hack on it with regret, as we all did on the mistakes made at the initiation of the dyestuffs manufacturing Industry,   We lost that trade, Germany was doing a world-wide trade in dyestuffs which we should have had in this country, and we must not make the same mistakes with artificial silk.COLONEL WILLEY remarked in connection with the silk duties that in these proposals the fact has been overlooked that the present Tariff in the United States is based entirely upon the selling price in the country of origin; therefore by imposing an excise duty inside this country it would be bound to affect exports to the United States .MR. SUTCLIFFE SMITH said he believed the same would be the case with Canada and Newfoundland.

Statement regarding the Export Trade Position m8.de at the meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Overseas Trade on the 27th May, 1925aSir Arthur Balfour (special steels, tools, etc.) who was unable to be present, sent a statement to the Commit tee which reads as follows.-&quot;The position of affairs in Sheffield has not improved. Trade is extraordinarily difficult, to do and competition is extremely severe.One of the most serious features is the French trade,     Mary firms are having to give up their branches and agency arrangements in Prance, because they find it quite impossible to compete with the French Steel makers on to-day&quot;s Exchange plus the co-efficient increase in the Tariffs.Unless there is an early charge I fear that the output of steel aad tools from Sheffield will show a considerable dealing during the next few months&quot;.Mr. Baker (steel works plant, boilers, castings, etc.) reported that the heavy Sheffield trade was very bad. Competition from Belgium, Sweden and Germany was fierce, at prices with which we&quot;&quot;could not compete.     What was most significant and most serious was that the curve of imports was approaching the curve of exports, and in his view the situation had riaver been more gloomy.     IP? pointed out that steel castings could be delivered in Sheffield from the continent at prices 20 per cent to 30 per cent, less than the cost of production of Sheffield foundries,     As regards the lighter trades, German   competition was very keen and many contracts had to be taken, if they could be obtained, at a loss,4MggJJLTURAI, MaCHLflEHY.Mr, Rowland reported that the situation with regard to agricultural machinery was bad in the- home trade owing to depression in the agricultur&amp;lindustry.     As regards the export trade, he thought that not enough importance was attached to costing by the British manufacturer and illustrated a difference in the methods of the British and the German manufacturer.     He stated that the German manufacturer started by taking a figure of (say)  60,000 for overhead charges which he would have to find.      This sum was distributed over all contracts on the basis of working to 75 par cent, capacity, while in each contract he quoted 100 per cent, for direct labour j!hs British manufacturer, on the other hand, took: each contract separately.and added to the 100 per cent, for direct labour charges somewhere between 33 and 50 par cant, to cover his overhead charges.     In       of. .1c a , therefore, the Gorman manufacturer spread the overhead charges more than was done by British manufacturers and was therefore able to fulfil his contracts more cheaply.      It was commented by various members ex the Committee that, the G^r^an method wass dependant upon-    orders/
q c; 7prices/orders being obtained to practically the full capacity, and that the difficulty nowadays was to get orders at all.     Mr. Samuel stated that ha was much interested in Mr. Rowland1 s report and that he fully realised the importance of scientific costing methods for British manufacturers, and difficult as it was to interfere in other people *s &quot;business he would lose no opportunity of bringing the matter to the notice of manufac-turere.HARDWARE.Mr. Vyle reported that the situation in Birmingham had been disappointing since the beginning of the year.    As regards jewellery, fancy goods and hollow-ware, exports were very bad, owing to competition from the continent.    The keenness of competition from the continent was due to long hours of work, low wages, and rate of exchange.SILK AKD ARTIFICIAL SILK,Mr. tfarrell stated that as regards the silk and artificial silk industry which had been very much in the public eye lately, imports had increased enormously, but he thought that under the modified proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer the trade had been adequately safeguarded and that the industry would continue to prosper.     As regards his own firm, they were working now to full capacity and had actually placed orders for additional plant.Mr. Johnston stated that he could not give a glowing account of the pottery trade, and that unfortunately unemploy-ment was higher.     He intimated that china manufacturers had been particularly badly hit by German competition and the trade was actually only working two days a week.     His Council had asked the Board of Trade for cost of production of figures abroad, with a view to an application under the   Safeguarding of Industries Act.     As regards tiles and sanitaryware, the position was not so bad, but certain competition was being encountered in the latter trade from German, Japanese and C2echoslovakian makers.CHBMICALSoSir Max Muspratt (heavy chemicals) reported a steady improvement in the alkali side of the chemical industry. The figures for export were higher than in 1513, while in China and Japan the situation was buoyant, though competition was expected in Japan-.     As regards soda ash they were able to sell in the world&apos;s markets against foreign manufacturers. The Chinese Civil War did not appear to have made much difference to the . soda ash trade and it wbb only in the last three months that the troubles seemed to have had an influence.     As regards India he pointed out that the paper mills were in a bad way and were demanding a protective duty.     If they did not obtain protection they would probably have to close down, with the result that, the demand from this country   would cease.     As regards sulphate of soda, trade was fairly good in Canada and we were holding out own in South America and Mexico.     As regards caustic soda he pointed out that there was in the United States a prohibitive duty, but the Tariff Board, or whoever were responsible in the United States of America apparently were not troubled at high
prices being charged to the consumer in the home market, provided a portion of the output was exported at no matter what price.     This had a serious effect on British exports, as It amounted to dumping, though it was very difficult to bring the matter home owing to the skilful manner in which It was accomplished.     Mr. Samuel promised to look into this question.CHINA IgRADB.Mr. Do&amp;well (China merchants trade) had a depressing report to make in regard to the Chinese trade, which in his experience had never been in so serious a condition.     New orders were conspicuous by their absence and the Treaty ports were full of undelivered goods.     Mr. Samuel stated that a proposal had been put forward again by lancaeh ire that a Mission should he sent to the Par East consisting of employers and employees to examine the position and report.     Mr. Bodwell stated that, in his view, the time was not yet ripe for such a Mission.INDIAN TRAJ)S,Mr. Lindsay stated that, as regards India, he agreed with Mr. Dodwell that the time was not ripe for such a Mission.     Depression in India was increasing and the purpose cf such a Mission would be misunderstood..       Dealing generally with Indian trade Mr. Lindsay stated that pre-war imports into India from the United Kingdom amounted to 63 per cent, of the total trade.     For the year ending 31st IMrch, 1925, the proportion was 54 per cent.     Bearing In mind that this figure did not include Government imports, including railway material, which were heavy, he thought that this figure was not unsatisfactory.     He pointed out that the proportion of imports of raw materials had increased and that consequently there was a. reduction in the proportion of manufactured goods and particularly of highly priced manufactured goods.     He expressed the opinion that the shipment from India to the United Kingdom of pig Iron was a temporary phase.As regards cotton piece goods the proportion was   88 per cento as against 99 per cent, pre-war.     Mr. Lindsay stated that ha had received, and was sending in for the in-forcation of the Department, an interesting report called &quot;The Industrial Trade Review for India&quot;, which was prepared by anti-British interests in India and published in Berlin for the information of German manufacturers.     The Report forrw&amp; :iot unsatisfactory reading for this country.     Mr. Samuel said that this would be examined with great interest in the Department.
