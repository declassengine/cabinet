(W1 ., 414THIS ^^PMgMTJM^THg PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. fl P.232(25).Q&apos;** CABINET.SECRET._______ Copy HO*^&amp;BUILDING MATERIALS (CHARGES AND SUPPLY) BILL.Memorandum by   Minister of Health.I   desire to consult tho Cabinet as to tho line to bo taken on the 2nd Rending of ths Building Materials (Charges and Supply) Bill which Is first Order on Friday, May 15th.The Bill Is identically tho same as that introduced by the late Government last year.   Ito main provisions are that on a representation being made by the Minister of Health, tho Board of Trade shall have power to investigate tho cost of any article used in connection with house building, and for tho purposes of the investigation shall have power to call for all books, records, etc., that thoy may think necessary.If the Board of Trade are satisfied that tho price of the article is unreasonable they may make an order fixing the prico, and this order will be applicable to the person whose business has been investigated, or if necossary,   to a combination of persons.If the Minister of health, after consultation with theBoard of Trade considers that supplies are being unduly restricted,he may, by order, requisition stocks of an article from the outputof the business and may take over premises and plant with a view torunning a business on behalf of tho Government.While under certain conditions it mi^it be necessary fortho Government to tako sane   stops to provent exploitation of thepublic, restrictive measures (particularly of the drastic natureproposed in the Bill) which would tend to shako the confidence of no industry, should only bo adopted as a last resort, and onProaent information thoro has not been a riso in tho prico ofbuilding matorlals which would call for such action.   The manu-facturcrs and suppliers of building materials gave my predecessora Pledge that they would adhero to the prices prevailing atJanuary, 1924, except in so far as somo variation was renderedfcsoessary by any fluctuation in cost of wages, fuel and raw material.,-1-
ana  he In his turn promised that prloo3 should not be     - -    1 d considered unreasonable so long ae thoy carao within this condition.     Thore ie no evidence that the manufacturers have attemptod to broak away from this pledge.Tho Rational Light Castings Association have recently announced an increase in the price of their goods, but this matter is at present undor investigation by the Inter-Departmental Committee appointed to Survey the Prices of Building Motor ids, and their report is not yet available. Reference will, no doubt, bo made by the movers of the Bill to tho Interim Report of this Committee in May of last year when, under tho acting Chairmanship of Mr. A.V.Alexander, thoy were Inquiring into an increase in the price of bricks, and reported that they found themselves inadequately equipped to ascertain the facts.    Tho Commit too has, however,   been reconstituted since that date.      It now includes representatives of the manufacturers, end it Is submitted that further inquiries by the Committee in its new form might lead to moro satisfactory results.The representatives of the m&amp;mif aoturera have placed their views as to the proposed Bill before mo.     In addition to the point that the proposed Bill would have a deterrent effect on tho invostniont of capital in tho industry, they adduced tho not unreasonable argument that it was unfair that thoy should bo aln^lod out for restrictive measures which did not apply to tho other parties concerned with the building of houses, nmely, the operatives and the contractors.   In this connection it may be notod that while   according to tho returns received the average contract price of a ncn-parlour house ahow3 an increase of  53 ovor January, 1924, tho total cost of materials has increased by approximately only  13.A motion for the rejection of the Bill has already boon put down by Ur. Reiner and it is probable that opposition to tho Bill will also be manifested by such bodice as tho federation of British Industries who will be afraid that tho
Bill may serve as a precedent for similar restrictive action in the case of other Industries.

I submit that in the course of debate I should represent that no case has been made out for the Bill which would operate invidiously and might seriously injure the trades concerned, but I would repeat the pledge already given that should circumstances warrant further action I should be prepared to ask the House to give me additional powers. Meanwhile this Bill should be rejected and the Whips put on for the division.

I have consulted the President of the Board of Trade who concurs in these proposals.
