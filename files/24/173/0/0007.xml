[This Document is the Property of His Brtonnic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1925.SECRET.30CP. 206 (25).CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 115.    March 1925.THE number of persons on the Registers at the end of March was 1,194,313, a decrease of 41,752 since the end of February. It will be seen from the table below that the downward movement of the figures was maintained throughout the period. The decrease may be attributed mainly to seasonal causes and no general improvement in employment in the chief industries is reported.In motor and aircraft engineering employment continued good, while increased activity was shown in the building trade, chiefly in painting and decorating work. The coal-mining, iron and steel and shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries continued very slack.A. STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,May 1, 1925.I.(A.)

II.-POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES. COAL MINING.Employment in this industry continued generally slack, and in some districts showed a further decline. In the Northumberland and Durham coal-field the position became worse. More collieries closed down and others introduced short-time working. Over 20,000 miners became unemployed during the month. The South Yorkshire coal-field also became affected by the depression, and in the Doncaster area short-time working was introduced at a number of collieries. A colliery in the Leeds area closed down and also one at Goldthorpe, near Mexborough, while short time was worked in the Batley and Morley areas. In the Lancashire coal-field increased employment in some districts counterbalanced increased unemployment in other districts, but short-time working was fairly general. In the Midlands unemployment was still heavy, and there was much short-time working. Employment was good at Stourbridge, poor at West Bromwich, and there was a further decline at Walsall; short time was worked at Nottingham. An improvement was shown at Ilkeston, but the position was still unsteady. At Mansfield full-time working was the rule, and the position there and at Chesterfield was good. Unemployment increased in North Staffordshire, particularly at Newcastle-under-Lyme. There was less employment at Coalville. In the Kent coal-field the position was unsettled, and there was a surplus of men remaining unabsorbed. In the South-Western Counties the improvement was maintained in the Forest of Dean, and full time was being worked near Kingswood. In Scotland the depression in the Fife coal-field continued, and there were no signs of improvement in the export trade. Suspensions took place at Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy, Kilmarnock, Falkirk, Bathgate, Dalkeith and Loanhead. In the Welsh coal-fields no improvement took place. The resumption of working in some collieries was counterbalanced by intermittent working and stoppages in other districts.IRON AND STEEL.No improvement was shown in this industry, and heavy unemployment still prevailed. Conditions were quiet in the Sheffield area, and makers of steel billets were suffering from a lack of orders, while rolling mills were slack. Firms engaged in the manufacture of railway material and motor-car parts were moderately well employed. The position in the Cleveland area showed little change. Stocks of pig-iron were still heavy, and two furnaces on Teeside have been damped down, while two others are likely to be blown out unless early improvement in trade takes place. On the other hand, iron foundries at Middlesbrough engaged in the manufacture of iron pipes and segments for the Underground Railways gave good employment, and workers were re-engaged at Stockton-on-Tees. The depression still continued in the Scunthorpe area. In the Midlands no material improvement was shown in the North Staffordshire district. At Hanley short time was still being worked, and the position at Newcastle-under-Lyme was depressed. Two furnaces at Basford were still in full blast, and the improvement at Chesterfield was maintained. All furnaces, except one, in the Ilkeston area, were working full time. The position was steady at Derby, but short-time working was resumed in the Kettering area. Trade was depressed in the South Staffordshire district, and employment was intermittent at Brierley Hill, Cradley Heath, Oldbury, Stourbridge, Walsall and West Bromwich. At Bilston one firm closed down definitely and another suspended 700 men. At Tipton a local works has been dismantled and two others have closed indefinitely. In Scotland blast furnaces were damped down in the Ayr districts; and suspensions took place at Johnston and Motherwell. In Wales a slight recovery was reported. Even in those works affected by the tin-plate trade a distinct advance was made.TIN-plate TRADE.There was a slight improvement in this industry, and there were signs of recovery from the depression at Llanelly, Swansea Morriston, Neath and Port Talbot. Short-time working was still the rule, except at a few establishments where &quot;full time had been resumed.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Little change took place in this industry, and the outlook is not encouraging. On the North-East Coast the shipyards of two firms were entirely closed down, and
the closing of a Middlesbrough shipyard is contemplated. The situation in the North Tyne area will be relieved by the receipt of orders for the building of a 14,000-ton steamer at Wallsend, and the construction of four tankers at Walker-on-Tyne. At Sunderland thirty-five berths remained unoccupied, and one firm closed their shipyard during the month, this being the second Sunderland shipyard to close down this year. A slight decrease in employment occurred at Hull, but the yards at Selby were fully employed on orders for steam trawlers. At Barrow-in-Furness contracts were nearing completion, and no new contracts have yet been received. On the Mersey there was an increase of unemployment among ship repairers. On the Thames, at Bermondsey and Tilbury, employment in ship repairing showed some improvement. Employment was slack at Chatham, but there was an improvement at Lowestoft, as a result of the building of fishing boats. At the Bristol Channel ports the position was not so good, and discharges both of skilled and unskilled workpeople from the repair yards at Avonmouth have taken place since last month. At Cowes (Isle of Wight) further discharges took place on the completion of the third of the four destroyers for the Greek Government. A slight improvement was shown at Gosport and Southampton, although work was still slack at the latter place. The position remained poor at Woolston. In Scotland new tonnage launched in the Clyde during march reached the highest figure on record for the month. It is reported that a contract for two cruisers has been placed by the Australian Government at Clydebank, and contracts for four cargo steamers of 7,000 tons dead weight have been secured at Port Glasgow, the engine work for the latter to be done at Greenock. At other places orders for new work were only for small vessels. Some improvement was apparent in repair work at Leith and Ayr, while at Dundee work was slack.ENGINEERING.Motor Cycle and Aircraft Engineering. Continued activity was shown in this industry and most works were fully employed. Trade continued good at Oxford, but there was a decline in the motor cycle trade at Kingswood. Motor and aeroplane works at Woolston and Cheltenham gave good employment. At Birmingham nearly all firms were working to their maximum capacity, but the position in the pedal cycle trade was not so good. Trade continued good at Conventry and Derby, and employment was steady at Redditch, but continued to fluctuate at Dudley. At Nottingham trade generally was fairly good Tn the South-Eastern area there was continued activity. At Lincoln, motor works were fully employed with large orders for component parts, while works at Preston and Southport were fully employed in the making of lorries.General Engineering. In most districts there were signs of a slight improve-ment, but progress was slow and employment generally was only fair. In the North-Eastern Counties contracts for railway material and rolling-stock for home and foreign railways were secured by Lincoln firms, but the agricultural machinery branch is still slow in reviving. Railway works at Doncaster were employed to their full extent and two shifts are at present in operation, but at Darlington the completion of all engines under the current programme caused some discharges from the night shift. Railway work at Sheffield provided full time employment. There was a slight decline in the making of engineers&apos; small tools and files, but agricultural tools were in demand owing to seasonal requirements. Employment in textile machinery was not so good, and short time was introduced at Keighley. Marine engineering was very quiet, due to the reduced activity of shipyards; discharges took place at Stockton-on-Tees and Wallsend, but the placing of contracts in the North Tyne area may relieve the situation. In the North-Western Counties a slight improvement was shown and there was less unemployment at Openshaw. Most districts reported some improvement in textile engineering, while full-time working was fairly general in the locomotive and machine-tool sections and in certain other specialised branches, including the electrical section. Slackness prevailed in most of the other sections, especially heavy engineering. In the Midlands unemployment was still heavy, but better conditions prevailed and there was aslight improvement m nearly all centres. Employment was better at Birmingham and Aston, steady at Sparkhill and West Bromwich, and a further slight improvement was shown at rv I anc^ Smethwick. Further reductions in unemployment took place at Dudley and Worcester, and a slight improvement was shown at Stafford and R,ugby, out the position was only fair at Long Eaton and Nottingham. Employment continued good in all branches at Newark and Chesterfield, but was only fair at -Derby. Trade was good at Leicester and Stamford, while there was a marked decrease in short-time working at Kettering, but employment was only fair at
Peterborough. In wagon building, employment was good at Birmingham and other places. In the South-Eastern Counties the position was fairly good, on the whole, but in some districts the previous substantial improvement was not fully maintained. Trade was quieter in East London. North and West London continued busy, but employment at Croydon was not so good. Progress was made at Chelmsford, Dartford, Maidstone, Luton, Norwich and Slough, and some overtime was being worked at Braintree (mainly on steel casement work for export) and Guildford The position was only fair at Ipswich and Chatham, but showed signs of improve-ment. Trade at Letchworth was quieter. In electrical work there was generally no sign of slackness, but at Dagenham there was less work. Work for women in this branch (including wireless) was generally quiet. In the South-Western Counties some improvement was shown in the agricultural and railway branches of the industry, but otherwise there was little change from last month. Conditions were only fair at Gloucester, a large number of skilled and semi-skilled men being unemployed, and the prospects were not good at Bristol, all sections being depressed. The improvement in the Reading area was still maintained, while railway work at Swindon still continued to absorb workers. In Scotland there was little sign of improvement, and orders were scarce. A firm at Paisley is changing over from the making of textile machinery to the manufacture of small induction motors. In Wales employment was only fair.TEXTILES.Cotton. Little change took place in this branch of the textile industry. In Lancashire some centres showed a slight increase in unemployment, and there was a fairly large increase at Preston, due to the temporary stoppage of certain mills. Organised short-time working continued in the American spinning section. Trade was better in the manufacturing section than in the spinning section, and there was a shortage of weavers in many districts, but at Blackburn many mills were idle owing to lack of orders, weavers tending three looms instead of four. The position at Bolton and Preston was only fair, and was poor at Great Harwood. Weaving at Haslingden showed increased activity, and there was an improvement at Accrington and Colne, while at Nelson not a single weaver was unemployed. Spinning was good at Accrington, and fairly good at Bolton. Short-time working still continued in the bleaching, spinning, dyeing and finishing branches. In Yorkshire most firms were working full time, and employment improved at Todmorden and was good at Sowerby Bridge. Employment was better at Bridgeton, but there was still slackness among weavers.Woollens and Worsteds. Little change took place in this industry, and short-time working was fairly general. At Bradford there was an increase in unemployment and under-employment. The position at Batley and Morley improved slightly, but became worse at Keighley. In Scotland employment in the woollen and tweed trade was fair, but short-time working was resorted to at Ayr, Hamilton, Alloa and Galashiels.   In Wales the position was still bad.Hosiery. There were signs of improvement in several centres, but trade was quiet at Nottingham and the depression still continued at Beeston. At Long Eaton and Leicester there was a slight improvement. At other places short-time working was prevalent. In Scotland firms were fairly busy, but conditions were variable. Underwear manufacture became slack, but trade in outer garments was busy at Hawick, while an improvement took place at Dumfries and Kilmarnock.Lace. Unemployment still remained heavy, but there was a slight improve-ment. At Basford there was much short-time working among men employees, but some improvement in employment took place among women employees. There was an improvement in the curtain and plain-net sections at Beeston, but the Levers section remained depressed. The position at Nottingham and Ilkeston was unchanged, but a slight improvement took place at Long Eaton; trade remained very-quiet at Newark. Trade was still slack at Barnstaple, and short time was worked at Exeter and Tiverton, but at Chard there was a temporary improvement, due to orders for mosquito nets for India.Silk. The slight improvement reported last month was maintained. At Leek there was no increase in employment, but more activity was apparent in the extension of premises and the erection of new dye-houses. Improvement continued at Derby and Leicester, and trade was still brisk at Nuneaton. The position at Coventry was temporarily quiet. Silk weaving was still slack at Letchw^orth, but was good at Braintree, while artificial silk manufacturing at Flint was very busy.
jute. Employment in this branch continued steady, though there was a tendency to slackness in the finishing sections.Carpets. There was no improvement at Kidderminster, where suspensions for short periods took place.BUILDING, BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.Increased activity was shown and employment remained good. This was largely due to the seasonal demand for painting and decorating work, and large numbers of unemployed painters have now been absorbed. The demand for skilled operatives continued heavy and a shortage was still felt in many districts. Numbers of unskilled workers at Newton Stewart and Stranraer were absorbed in the erection of steel-frame houses. The brick-fields were very active and regular employment was maintained. The firebrick industry at Stamford was fairly good. Tile-making provided steady employment at Hanley, Hereford and Stoke-bn-Trent.CLOTHING.There was a definite improvement in this industry, due to seasonal causes. Wholesale branches were very busy and employment improved in the retail branches. In the West End of London employment in ladies&apos; wholesale tailoring was good and there was a shortage of workers, while ladies&apos; retail tailoring was reviving slightly. Work in men&apos;s tailoring was slack, especially in the retail branch. In the East End both branches of tailoring remained very busy. In the wholesale clothing trade at Leeds unemployment considerably decreased. At Huddersfield practically all tailoresses resumed full-time employment, and there was an increased demand for tailoresses, dressmakers and milliners. At Wishaw machinists who had been unemployed since 1921 were absorbed.- There was a slight improvement in the shirt and collar trade in the Barnstaple a,rea, and full time was worked at Exeter. The corset industry improved at Eastville, Kingswood and Portsmouth, but short time was worked at Hackney and Ipswich. Trade in the glove industry was slack at Yeovil, Torrington and Barnstaple.BOOT AND SHOE.There was no general improvement in this industry and unemployment was still heavy. Employment was good at Bilston and Derby; an improvement was shown at Stafford, but trade was quiet at Wellingborough, and a considerable falling off took place at Rushden. Short-time working was still prevalent at Dudley, Kettering, Mansfield and Northampton. At Bristol an improvement was shown both in the manufacturing and retail branches, but irregular short time was worked at Kingswood. In the London factories a steady trade was being done and there was continued improvement. The position was not so good amongst men at Norwich, where three large firms suspended clickers, but among women employment improved. There was also some slackness amongst men at Guildford. The slipper trade at Bacup showed some improvement, but there was still short-time working both here and at Rawtenstall.POTTERY.The improvement in this industry was maintained, although unemployment continued moderately heavy. Trade remained good at Basford, but short time was prevalent at Burslem, Chesterfield and Longton, while trade was slack at Hanley and snort-time working was general. In the sanitary tiles and fireclay section trade was very busy. A steady improvement was shown at Stoke, the first-class china trade wing exceptionally good, but other grades were not so satisfactory. Trade was fairly satisfactory at Worcester, where little unemployment prevailed, and at Bristol, where tull-time working took place.BOCKS.Unemployment increased at most ports, but at the London Docks increased activity was shown. At Great Yarmouth the register of dockers reached the highest ItTT 11 Sjme tlme&quot; There was less employment on the North-Eastern Coast, chiefly si sir r i Goole- 0n the Merseyside employment increased slightly, whilst a fairly suDstantial decrease in employment was recorded at Manchester Docks, due to mmmished importations of raw cotton. At the Bristol Docks trade was below Wal &apos; ^ Position was sti11 bad at Gloucester and Sharpness. At the South wales ports the position was unsatisfactory at Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, but there was a slight improvement at Holyheaa.
III. WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24))]The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes out in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and Bridge Schemes assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception of certain road schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by the Ministry of Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Exchanges from Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned.It should be noted that in view of recent modifications in the scope of the table the figures given cannot properly be compared with those previously announced in Parliament in similar connections. The figures given for March 1924, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.		number cf men employed at 				works assisted by 						mar. 28, 1925.! feb. &apos;28, 1925. i 1		mar. 28,1924.	1.	ministry of transport 					road and bridge schemes	18,197*	16,839*	12,887*	2.	unemployment gr,\nts committee	44,400*	42,151*	42,717*	3.	ministry of agriculture and fisheries 					(a.) land drainage schemes	4,473	4,172	6,309		(b.) water supply schemes	332	365	426	4.	board of agriculture for scotland 					land   drainage   and   improvement					schemes	591	407	559	5.	forestry commission -					grants   to   corporate bodies and					private individuals	957f	920	1,176	6.	office of woods, &amp;c. 					wash reclamation works, wingland	41	36		7.	ministry of transport 					halwill-torrington light railway . .	161	145	438	8.	office of works 					unemployment relief programme . .	2,450	3,790	1,374	9.	guarantees under trade facilities acts	45,4 90+	49,1381.	33,5691		total    ..	117,097	117,963	99,455	* these figures represent the number of men actually employed on the site on the date given, and exclude any additional men not at work on that date for whom employment is also provided by means of alternate week working or other short time system. the figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly. e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t in addition to the figures quoted, the average number of men employed during march 1925 on the commission^ operations (including crown woods) was 2,572 as compared with 2,295 during march 1924.I these figures indicate men employed on the work itself. they include part only of the men employed on the manufacture of the materials used. they take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.
IY. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment and should not be so regarded. It should be borne in mind that the excess of the total outward over the total inward movement from this country is somewhat less than 100,000 a year, and therefore small in comparison with the natural increase of population which for many years before and after the war has not been much less than 400,000 a year.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the month of February (with the corresponding figures for February of last year) and for the eleven months ended the 28th February, 1925 and 1924 respectively are set out in the following Table : Monthly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved underSettlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.The Empire	Number of Approvals.

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.

Unemployment Insurance. (Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924 the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to March 31, 1925.Expenditure-                    Benefit paid         ....          ....         .... 198,362,000Appropriation for Administration   .... 18,582,000Section 9 Unemployment InsuranceAct (No. 2), 1924        ....         .... 1,175,000Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;c.....          ....         .... 2,680,000--   220,799,000Income Contributions Employers           ....          .... .... 75,303,000Employed            ....          .... .... 68,354,000Exchequer           ....          .... .... 49,561,000Exchequer (for ex-Service Men) .... 3,086,000196,304,000Interest (Net).... .... .... 819,000Balance of Old Fund at Armistice (excluding Interest accrued) * Emplovers .... .... ....      5,825,000Employed .... .... ....      5,825,000Exchequer ............      3,884,000--     15,534,000Loans from Treasury (Net).... .... .... 7,430,000Miscellaneous- Deposits in respect of future  Contribu-tions, &amp;c..... ............ 712,000220,799,000*&apos; Note.-The old Fund at November 8th, 1920, had reached a total of  22,210,000.Estimate of Benefit payable from Armistice to March 31, 1926,  240,000,000.

Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund.1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.
February 1924 Programme.A further additional programme estimated to cost  13,500,000 was authorised by the late Government, towards which the Eoad Fund will contribute a maximum of  10,400,000.

Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, of small holdings and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and (b) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement.(A.) England and Wales.
