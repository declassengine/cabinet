THIS DOCUMENT IS ME PROPERTY OF this BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.icret..204(25).Improved Old Age Pens ions and Pens Ions Tor &quot;Rxdoweci Mot.ja.ers .Copy No. 2-^fitpmorandum by the Minister of Health.The King13 Speech at the opening of Parliament included tue following paragraph:-&quot;My Ministers.are engaged upon enquiries into the possibility of combining with existing systems of insurance provisions for improved old age pensions and pensions for widowed mothers&quot;.It may be within the recolleotion of my colleagues that this, with other questions as to social services, was referred during our last period of office to a committee of Civil Servants of high standing presided over toy Sir John Anderson.     That Committee submitted to the late Cabinet a report (a copy of which is appended to this memorandum) embodying a scaeme for contributory pensions to widows and orphans and old age pensions at age 55, and though the scheme did not receive formal Cabinet approval, certain public statements made by the late Chancellor of the Exchequer were understood to mean that his colleagues proposed to act on it.I considered the a scheme carefully and came to the conclusion that, subject to certain modifications and necessary safeguards mainly dictated by a more detailed investigation of the relation of the scheme to tne National Health Insurance Act, it should be accepted as the basis of the legislative proposals to which we are committed by various public statements before, during %xi&amp; since the late election, and by the statement made on our behalf In Parliament on the 1st of April.
-./&apos;I&quot;ae financial implications of the scheme were discussed by ma with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and wo arrived at general agreement.A bill was prepared giving effect to the scheme and was considered by a Committee of Ministers.     The Bill of which a copy is appended to this Memorandum has been concurred In by that Committee and the following paragraphs contain a summary of It3 essential principles.General.It is a scheme on a Compulsory and contributory basis.     The compulsory basis involves the limitation of the scheme to the employed population, since the only practicable method of collecting contributions under such a a scheme is by periodical paymentG directly related to the payment of wages.       The scheme proposed ia oo-extensive wlta the National Health Insurance Scheme and provides benefits limited broadly to the survivors of members of the employed population insured under tiaat scheme, who now number approximately 15,000,000 persons in Great Britain.   An option Is given (as under health insurance) to a person who ceases to be compulsorily insurable on leaving employment, to continue in insurance as a voluntary contributor at the full rate of contribution ordinarily payable by employer and employee jointly. This will ensure tnat all members of the community who at some time in their lives pass through a period of insurable oraploy-ment of not leas than two years will have an opportunity of taking advantage of the a scheme.     Certain persons iTho by reason of means (holders of exemption certificates) are not now required to be insured for health insurance will continue to be exempt from health insurance but will be Insured for widows&apos; and orphans&apos; pensions.     Certain other classes of persona (persons in excepted
2-5 employment, such as school teachers, railway Clerks and others) who are outside health insuranoe on the ground that they are engaged in employments where the terms of the employment secure to them benefits equivalent on the whole to the health insurance benefits will continue to be excepted from health insurance but will be required to be Insured for widows&apos; and orphans&apos; and old age pensions, unless  it Is proved that the terms of their employment secure to them,  their widows and children, benefits corresponding to the pensions provided.Benefits.It is proposed that, subject to the qualifying conditions toeing satisfied (see below), pensions should be payable to the following classes of persons at the following rates .(a) Widows&apos; Pensions. 10/- a week for the widow of aninsured man who dies after the commencement of the Act and Is undor the age of 70 at its commencement, with an additional allowance for children up to the age of 14,  at the rates of 5/- a week for the eldest child and 3/&apos;- a week for each of the other children. The pension to the widow is payable until she attains the age of 70 or remarries.(The Anderson Committee recommended children&apos;allowance up to the age 16, but the lower age isnecessitated by financial considerations).The allowance for each child will continue at the above rates after the remarriage of the vridow until the child reaches the age limit specified.On the death of the widow, leaving a child or children under 14, such children will, until they
attain the age of 14, receive an orphans&apos; pension at the rate shown in (b) below.(b) Orphans1 Pens ions.    7/6 a week for the eldest child up to the age of 14, and 6/- a week for each of the younger children of an insured man being a married man or a widower or of an Insured widow.Child Includes a step-child,  also an illegitimate child living with the Insured person at the time of his or her death,(c) O^d Age Pensions,    lo/- a week to insured men and insured women between the ages of 65 and 70 and 10/- a week tothe wives, between 65 fend 70, of Insured men who are themselves entitled to pensions.(d) Persons in receipt of a widow&apos;s pension or an old age pension under the scheme will on attaining the age of 70be entitled to an Old Age Pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts 1908 - 1924, without the application of the tests required by those Acts as to means, residence and nationality.The standard figure of 10s .0d . a week for benefits is adopted as the highest figure admissible on financial, grounds.      It Is also the figure established for State Old Age Pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts 1908-1924. Criticism will doubtless be levelled at it on the ground of inadequacy.      It will be urged that a widow&apos;s pension at this figure and additional allowances for cnildren at the rates proposed will not enable the widow to devote ail her time to caring for her children.     The answer will be that the rate of pensions and allowances is only made practicable by virtue of
a liberal state subvention to the scheme, that they are such as represent the actuarial value of the contributions to entrants at age 16, that they will undoubtedly be of the utmost assistance in keeping families together and enabling the mother to devote more time to the children, and that by virtue of them recourse to trie poor law will be in many cases avoided.    (It may be of interest to state that the scheme is estimated to result in relief to the poor rates amounting to about three and a half millions rising to about eight millions a year).The Bill provides tnat unemployment benefit and sickness and disablement benefit under health insurance with corresponding contributions shall cease at 65. But employers will be required to continue to pay their share of the contributions for health, unemployment and pensions for workers over 65.     This provision is designed to remove any temptation to give a preference for employment to persons over 65 which might arise If contributions were not payable in respect of them.It is provided that a widow who is in reoeipt of a widows pension snail be exempt from health insurance and unemployment insurance.Provisions as regards widows and orphans.,of insured persons who died before &quot;&quot;oho &quot; oohyrienoefflgnt &apos;of /yho scheme .It has been necessary to consider the positionof widows and orphans of insured persons who died beforethe commencement of the sohemo.     The Anderson Committeewere of the opinion that provision for such cases would-o-
9 ibe found to be inevitable in any scheme and the Bill accepts that principle, though benefits in such oases will of course be In the nature of a free gift, the basis on which the Bill procoeds is to make the same arrangements for pre-Act cases as for post-Act cases, subjeot to the following main differences -(a) The pension of an existing widow is contingent on there being at least one child under 14 and will cease six months after the youngest child attains the age of 14.(b) Such widows will not be compulsorily exempt from health and unemployment insurance, since it would bo unfair to compel them to make a fresh start in insurance when their pension ceases if they are then in an Insurable occupation.    (Taey can if they choose obtain exemption on the ground that they possess a private income of  26 per annum). (o) The statutory condition establishing claim in the case of a widowfs and orphan1s pension will be that the normal occupation of tho deceased husband or parent was such that contributions would have been payable in respect of him or her under the Act if the Act had been in force at the time of death.
Dates of commeiicsment of scheme..Toe Bill proposes tlaat -(1) pre-Act ar-d post-Act widows and orphans pensions andchildren1a allowances shall commence as from the4th of January, 1926i (2) unrestricted old age pensions awarded in respect ofpersons over 70 on the 2nd of July, 1926, shall oommenceas from tnat date; (3) other old age pensions shall commence as from the 6thof January, 1928.The principle is that adopted in the National Health Insurance Acts, vis. that benefit should not accrue until a substantial number of contributions have been paid.   The qualifying period for disablement benefit under the national health Insurance scheme is two years and this period has been adopted for the normal case of the old age pensioner ( (3) above). The result of the deferment will be that for two fears fund will accumulate from contributions in excess of what Is needed for payment of benefits.     The effect of this on the financial scheme of the Bill is explained in tne statement explaining the f ins nee of the Bill to be circulated later.In respect of paw-Act widows and persona over 70 no contributions can be paid, because In the first case the ausbsnd is dead and in the second case the person by virtue of whose insurance the claim arises will have ceased contributions at age 70 under the working of the National wealth Insurance aeheme witrt which this scheme is combined.   Accordingly the
principle cannot be applied in these cases, and the dates selected for commencement of benefits In (1) and (2) arc simply the earliest dates by which it is thought that administrative arrangements can be completed.   The post-Act fcidovf oannot of course be placed in a worse position than the prs-Act widow and i3 therefore also brought in as from the 4th of January, 1920.Provisionsas regards persons over 70 before old age pensions under the &amp;l&quot;&apos;iri?olS^rtbe.The proposal that persons who receive old age pensions under the Bill shall proceed to old age pensions under the Old Age pensions Acts, 1908 to 1924, at age 70 without reference to means or other qualifications has necessitated consideration of the position of insured men or their wives over 70 at the date when old age pension benefits under the Bill commence who are receiving either no old age pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts or pension at leas than the full rate because of disqualification or partial disqualification under these Acts.    This class was not doalt with by the Anderson Com.nlttee.Jt is provided in the Bill that as from the 2nd July, 1926, a pension&apos;at the full rate under the Old Age Pensions Acts shall be given to the following classes, not-withstanding that the tests imposed by those Acts as to means, residence or nationality may not be satisfied:-(a) Persons who have been continuously insured since the introduction of the 3111 and are over 70 on the 2nd July, 1926.(b) Similar persons who attain the age of 70 after the 2nd July, 1926.(c) Wives and widows (if over 70 on the 2nd Ju3y,, 1926, or on attaining, that age subsequently) of men who have become entitled to a pension under (a) or (b)
JQualifying conditions.( a)   Widows&apos; arid, Orphans1 pjgnsions.The daceased husband or ( in the case of Orphans&apos; Pensions) parent must have been continuously insured up to the date of his (or her) death for at least 104 weeks and have paid at least 104 contributions.     The above condition was recommended by the Anderson Committee, but in order to protect the scheme against persons who are working on their own account for the greater part of the year, and do not pay contributions during that period, it has been thought proper to insert a further condition, viz. that in the last three years of insurance the number of contributions paid represents not lees than 26 contributions for each of these years. In accordance with the general practice under the Health Insurance scheme, weeks of notified sickness and weeks of genuine unemployment (i.e. where it is established that the insured person was available for but unable to obtain work) are to be counted as weeks for which contributions were paid. (b)    Old Age pensions.The claimant to a pension must have been continuously insured for at least 5 years immediately prior to the 6th January, 1928,  and have consequently paid contributions for two years under the new Act.     pensions will accrue on*the 6th January, 1928, in respect of all insured persons who ere then of the age of 65 years or upwards, and who satisfy this test.Persons who attain the age of 65 after the 6th January, 1928, must have been continuously Insured immediately prior to the date on which they attain that age for at least 5 years, have paid at least 104 contributions and during the three years immediately prior to the attainment of age 65, have credited in respect of them an average of 39 contributions
in each year ( weeks of sickness and genuine unemployment being counted as weeks for which contributions were paid).Safeguards against possible abuse.The case of s widow who may seek to avoid cancellation of her pension through remarriage by cohabitation without marriage iB dealt with in a subsequent page of this memorandum.     Two other possible oases of abuse are -(1)    The old ss&amp;n who marries a young girl in order toprovide her with a pension after his death; (Z)    The old man who marries a woman nearing the aga of 66 in order to ensure her an old age pension at 65 instead of 70. (1)    is dealt with under the proviso to clause 3(1), which ensures that the widow of a man who was 65 or over at the time of the marriage is to be disqualified for a widow&apos;s pension until she herself reaches the age of 65. ( )   is provided for under the proviso to clause 7(1) which lays down a waiting period of 5 years from the date of the marriage before the wife can claim an old age pension.
9 QJADMfll STHi; tion.The scheme provides for central administration by the Ministry of He&amp;lth with assistance from local authorities as set out in Clauses 6 end 40 of the Bill.The Anderson Committee (paragraph 34) pointed out thatthe Approved Societies need not be called on to share In theburden of administration to any material extent and I am satisfiedthat it would be unwise It not altogether impracticable to bring them into the scheme.     It is proposed that in so far as the societies are required to assist by furnishing particulars of insurance thay shall be remunerated by an appropriate payment for the specific service rendered.Question of transfer, suspension or canee11stion of r pension.The above reference to Clause 6 leads me to the verydifficult question of the circumstances in which the right towidow&apos;s pension and additional allowances should cease or the pension and allowances should be suspended or translerred fromthe mother or person In charge of the children.      This problem is one which will doubtless engage much attention when theeoheme is made public and also in Parliament, and the provisional conclusions at which I have arrived a e to be found in Clauses6 and SI, (combined with the disqualification provisions adoptedfrom the Old Age Pensions Acts and included in the second schedule).Clause 6 provides for a variety of oases in which the pension or allowances might properly be paid to persons other than the widow herself.Clause  1 deals with the case of disqualification for the widows pension and I draw attention here (1) to the proposed
e3disqualification resulting from &amp; representation from any Court, (2) to the proposed disqualification resulting from co-habitation,It ie obviously most difficult to say where the line should be drawn In regard to these questions.     It is evidently advisable to avoid placing the responsible Minister in the position of a &quot;censor inorum&quot; in regard to payments which ere s contractual right.     Where, in regard to the children, the object of the benefit ceases to be attained by default of the parent, there is a clear case for intervention and Clause 6 seems to me to make sufficient provision for this, bringing in the Court as far as possible and enabling the local authority also to intervene.     The case of the widow&apos;a own pension is more difficult and, as at present advised, I have left the matter on the basis of a representation to the Minister by ths Court in any class of case and of disqualification in the specific case of co-habitation (which, it will be seen, ie dealt with not as a moral offence but as a fraud by virtue of the provisions in 21( ) and S3(U).CONTRIBUTIONS. The Government Actuary has estimated that the actuarial value of the pension benefits at the age of 16 is equal to a weekly contribution of lOd. for a man and 5d. lor &amp; woman.     But the cessation at age 65 of the benefit eights under the health and unemployment schemes will release 2d. a week in respect of men (Id. from health and Id. from unemployment) and Id. a week in respect of women ( d. from health and  d. from unemployment) so that the contributions under the pensions scheme will normally involve a net increase of 84. for a man and 4d. for a woman.     Agricultural workers, railwayman and domestic servants are, however, not
s1insured under the unemployment j?ment scheme and consequently would derive no advantage from a reduction   in the unemployment contri-bution.     The imposition on these classes of a higher rate of contribution for pensions than that exacted from the insured population in general would produce serious administrative difficulties and the political difficulties which would be occasioned by a proposal to depart from a uniform rate of contribution would be not less serious.      It is therefore proposed (and I understand the Chancellor of the Exchequer agrees in principle) that the saving in cost of unemployment insuranos should not affect the contributions paid by employers or their work people but should operate to reduce the Exchequer contribution, which would thus fall from 6fd. to 5-f-d. a week as regards men and from 5-Jd. to 4^d. a week as regards women. The Exchequer in return would provide Id. (for women jj?d.) of the additional contribution required for the pension scheme. It should not be overlooked that the produce of Id. (women fd.) a week on the population insured under the unemployment scheme ie not equal to the produce of Id. (women i-d.) a week on the larger population proposed to be included in the pension scheme and that a charge of approximately  600,000 per annum would consequently be thrown upon the Exchequer by this arrangement.The effect of this transfer of Exchequer liability from the unemployment scheme to the pension scheme is to make the pensions contribution payable jointly by employer and employed 9d. &amp; week (for women 4fd. a week);    the joint contribution for unemployment insurance remains unchanged and the joint contribution-bution for health insurance as already explained is reduced
by 14. (for women - d.).     The net inoreaae resulting from the pensions scheme In the joint contribution for the three forms of insurance is therefore 8d. for men and 4d. for women. The contribution position for health insurance, unemployment insurance and pensions will be as set out in the following table.     It will be noted that as regards men the pension contribution is divided equally between employer and employed while as regards women the employer will pay 2fd. and the employee 2d. a week.     In the latter case, however, the employer enjoys a reduction of  &amp;. a week, in the contribution for health insurance so that in the result the additional burden, as in the case of men, is borne by employer and employee in equal shares.men.PRESENT RATESEmployerWorkers insured for Health andfcalthjgtaeffiployiaent tensionsTotaleees over present ratesa. &quot;d* S 101. 3WorkerTotalUnemployments. a. 591. 2lorkers insured for Health only.alth eneioneTotalcess over present rates5s. d.10 1. 72. 51010I*EW BATESEmployerporkers. d.4 4$1. 74-i 4;s. d,94l1. 644l 44Totals. d, 91. 7 93. 189 91 .6

- 1G -FINANCIAL A RRANGEMENTS.The Bill provides in Clauses 11 and 12 that the contributions received by the Minister from the Post Office shall be paid into a special account to be called the Pensions Account and that all pensions payable under the provisions of the Bill (other than old age ponslons payable by virtue of the Bill under the Old Age Pensions Acts 1908 to 1924) shall be paid out of the Pensions Account.The Bill also provides that the Treasury shall open a special account to be called the Treasury Pensions Account into which will be paid from time to time:-(a) the surplus of contributions over pensions aocruing in the early years in the Ministers Pens long Account and(b) the annual Exchequer contribution representing the average estimated deficit arising under the Scheme during the first 10 years:(c) the interest earned on the Investments made by the Treasury of the sums standing to the credit of the Account.Fayments will bo made as required from time to time from the Treasury Pensions Account to the Minister&apos;s Pensions Account to meet the excess of pension payments over contributions.The expenses incurred by the Minister and other Government Departments in the administration of the Act will bo paid out of monies provided by Parliament in the &apos; departmental votes, and, in order that the Pensions Account may show the real cost of the scheme, the expenses will be recovered by the Minister from the Pensions Account and applied as an appropriation in aid of the provision made
in the Ministry!8 Vote.As regards Scotland, there will be a Scottish Pensions Account to be kept end operated on by the Secretary for Scotland similar to the Pensions Account of the Minister for England and Wales, but it is proposed that there should be only one Treasury Pensions Account for the whole of Great Britain.The Pensions Accounts and the Treasury Penslone Account will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and presented together with his report to Parliament.The Bill further provides that In the ninth year after the commencement of the Scheme and in every succeeding tonth year an actuarial report on the financial operation of the Scheme and the Exchequer liabilities under it shall bo made to the Treasury and laid before Parliament.   Iftileas as the result of theso reports it is found to he necessary to ask Parliament to make other financial arrangements the ordinary rates of contribution In each of the first three decennial periods succeeding the year in which the report is made will be increased in t&amp;o oaso of men by 2d and in the case of women by Id a week.A statement explaining the finanoe of the Bill will he circulated later.(Sgd) N.C.Ministry of Health, 18th April, 1025.
f CONFIDENTIAL.COMMITTEE ON INSURANCE AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES.SECOND INTERIM REPORT.CONTRIBUTORY PENSIONS.PENSIONS FOR WIDOWS AND ORPHANS AND FOR PERSONS BETWEEN 65 AND 70.
CONFIDENTIAL.COMMITTEE  ON  INSURANCE AND  OTHER SOCIAL   SERVICES.SECOND INTERIM REPORT.To The Lords Commissioners oe His Majesty&apos;s Treasury.May it please Your Lordships,1. In our first Interim Report, dated 8th January, 1924, we considered a number of possible changes in the existing scheme of Old Age Pensions. This Report is concerned with the possibilities of a scheme of widows&apos; and orphans&apos; pensions and of a supple-mentary scheme of contributory old age pensions. In Part I. we have considered an independent scheme of pensions for widows and orphans linked up with existing pensions and insurance services and in Parts II. and III. a combined scheme of widows&apos; pensions and of contributory old age pensions for persons between 65 and 70.Part I. -Pensions eoe Widows and Orphans.Introductory.2. We were specially directed by our reference to examine the possibility of establishing a system of widows&apos; pensions. We have now had an opportunity of considering various proposals in the light of actuarial estimates of the prospective cost and we have reached certain conclusions as to the possibility of making provision for widows and orphans under such a system. We have throughout confined ourselves to a broad survey of the main problems that arise and in sketching the outlines of a suggested scheme we have not attempted to deal with details of administration. It can confidently be stated, however, that the working out of the necessary arrangements to give effect to our suggestions would, in the light of the experience now avail-able in the sphere of social services, present no insuperable difficulties to the experts in the various Departments concerned. At our suggestion this element of the problem is now being investigated departmentally.Character oe proposed Scheme Contributory Basis.3. The central problem which must be faced in any attempt to frame a practicable scheme of pensions for widows and orphans is necessarily one of finance and in attacking this problem we have felt bound to have regard not only to the current demandsx   (2)22456   \u 5354-s   12 10 18 100   11/24   e &amp; s a 2
4 .        iof existing social services, but also to prospective requirements due to the expansion of existing services already in operation, or contemplated, and to the setting up of entirely new services. At an early stage in our survey of the field it became clear that the cost of a scheme making reasonably acceptable provision for widows and orphans would be heavy at the outset and would increase rapidly for many years. Indeed, so heavy would the cost of such a scheme be, that we cannot but tear that an attempt to meet it wholly from the Exchequer would seriously retard, if it would not entirely cripple, efforts to develop other social services at least equally important. We have, therefore, been led to conclude that any practicable scheme must include provision for the raising of special revenue to meet some portion at least of the cost and, accordingly, in the proposals submitted in this Report, the adoption of the contributory principle is contemplated.Compulsory Basis.4. The experience so far gained in the field of social insurance points strongly to the conclusion that a contributory scheme providing for deferred or contingent benefits can only achieve its purpose if insurance is compulsory. In the case of widows&apos; pensions success would certainly be unattainable under any other condition. To finance a voluntary scheme attracting only the married, as would inevitably be the result of putting the scheme on an optional basis, would require a contribution greatly ex-ceeding that appropriate to a compulsory system and collected from married and single without distinction. Such a contribution would probably be prohibitive, and certainly would be so regarded by the mass of those for whom the scheme was designed. The administrative difficulties of such a scheme would also be acute. We are convinced that compulsory payment is an essential part of any contributory scheme of the kind.Limitation of Scope to Employed Population.5. It follows as a further consequence of the adoption of the contributory principle that the scheme must be limited in its application to the widows and children of the employed population, since the only practicable method of collecting contributions under such a scheme is by periodical payments directly related to the payment of wages. In the proposals submitted in this Report we have in mind a contributory scheme co-extensive with the National Health Insurance scheme and providing benefits limited broadly to the survivors of members of the employed population insured under that scheme. We select the scheme of National Health Insurance for this purpose rather than that of Unemployment Insurance because of its wider scope. Agricultural and railway workers are within the scheme of National Health Insurance, but all of the one groiqa and the great majority of the other are excluded from the scheme
of Unemployment Insurance.   The position is the same with the C?      smaller class of male domestic workers.6. It should be mentioned at this stage that while we recom-mend that the scheme should be co-extensive in scope with that of National Health Insurance and while we propose to rely in some degree upon the facilities which the central administrative machinery of National Health Insurance may afford, the benefits would not be incorporated in those of the National Health Insurance system or administered as part of those benefits. The liabilities arising under a system of widows&apos; pensions are different both in kind and in magnitude from those of the Health insurance system, and grave financial risk would result from their inclusion among the responsibilities of the thousands of small societies and branches which are operating under that system.7. Apart from the provision of necessary revenue, the adoption of the contributory principle and the consequent limitation of the scope of the scheme to the employed population offers other important advantages over a non-contributory scheme. On the one hand the proposition of a non-contributory scheme would at once raise the question of a means qualification and use of investigating machinery to make its operation effective. On the other hand, the limitation of the scope of a widows&apos; pension scheme to the same field as that of the Health Insurance scheme enables use to be made of &quot; insured status &quot; for Health Insurance purposes as a simple test of liability to contribute and of eligibility for receipt of pension, the creation of special machinery thus being avoided. Apart from this administrative advantage we presume that in the light of experience of the working of the existing Old Age Pension system, it will be desired to avoid a means qualification, if possible, in any new scheme of social service which may be set up. - 8. We have considered the possible criticism that there may be persons in the community in need of the provision to be made by the scheme who will have no opportunity of contributing under a scheme based upon employment. We have already pointed out (para. 4) that contributions based upon a voluntary system would be prohibitively heavy and this would equally be the case if the system provided for a class of voluntary contributors similar to that for which provision (now repealed) was made by the National Insurance Act of 1911. As in that case, the contributions would have to be graded by age and might also have to discriminate according to the relative ages of husband and wife and the composition of the family. Such conditions would gravely complicate the scheme even if they became operative to the very small extent which is all that past experience would justify us in expecting.9. We propose, however, that as under the Health Insurance scheme, a person leaving compulsory insurance on leaving insurable employment should have an option to continue in
insurance as a voluntary contributor at the ordinary rate of contribution; this will ensure that all male members of the community who at some time in their lives pass through a period of insurable employment of not less than two years, will have an opportunity of making provision for their surviving widows and children. We do not overlook the risk of loss involved in the probability that for the most part only those who think they are likely to benefit under the scheme will remain in insurance (see para. 4). But the alternative of providing a surrender value on the termination of insurable employment, would both be unsatisfactory in principle and, the benefits being contingent, actuarially difficult if not indeed unsound. In these circumstances we feel that thee, only practicable course is to grant an option to those whose rights have originated under compulsion as proposed.10. Further, a special and temporary concession would probably be necessary in order to allow persons who, before the commencement of the Widows&apos; Pension scheme, had left insurable employment and had ceased to be insured under the Health Insurance scheme, to re-enter insurance as voluntary contributors under the conditions indicated in subsequent paragraphs of this Report.11. Subject to these conditions, it can confidently be stated that all but an insignificant proportion of those whose economic circumstances render such provision desirable, will be, or will at some time have been, insured persons and as such in a position to make provision for their dependants under the scheme proposed.12. We wish at this stage to lay stress on the importance of maintaining the closest connection from the point of view of scope and of contributions between any scheme of pensions for widows and the Health Insurance scheme. In particular there should be no option for voluntary contributors to contribute under one scheme while remaining outside the other. It is of real importance frcm the point of view of the future development of the social insurance services generally that the various schemes should be regarded by insured persons as parts of a single whole and they will be the more likely to do so if the contributions are as far as practicable consolidated into a single weekly payment.Benefits.13. The cash amounts of the benefits to be granted under the scheme must of necessity depend upon financial considerations -the amount of the contribution which can be levied and the hability which can be placed upon the Exchequer. A further important consideration is the- need for maintaining some relation to the scale of benefits under schemes existing or in contemplation. It is evident that a grant of benefit under one scheme disproportionately-portionate to benefits obtainable under other schemes in com-
parable circumstances of need must have serious reactions upon the pensions and insurance services as a whole.14. The scope and duration of benefits appear to be dictated by the nature of the scheme itself. As we conceive it, the primary purpose of a scheme of pensions such as that now under consideration is to enable mothers, in cases where the family breadwinner is dead, to devote proper care to the upbringing of dependent children. We propose, therefore, that pensions should be granted to widowed mothers, supplemented by allow -ances in respect of children so long as they are dependent. The same pension and allowances should also be payable during dependence, to children without parents whose mother, if alive, -would have been eligible for a widow&apos;s pension. We think that a widow&apos;s pension should cease on remarriage, but the allowances payable in respect of children should be continued.15. It seems usually to have been contemplated by the advocates-cates of widows&apos; pensions that the right to such a pension would only subsist so long as the widow was responsible for the care of dependent children. It does not appear that such a limitation would be feasible in practice. The object and the result of a grant of pension would be to withdraw the majority of widows from the competitive labour market, at any rate while they have the care of dependent children. The effect of such with-drawal would be, if not to unfit them in most cases for resumption of employment, at least to handicap them very severely in competition with persons who had maintained their position in regular employment. We conclude therefore that in practice the pension to a widow could not be withdrawn when her children ceased to be dependent, and we propose that any grant of pension should be made continuous until remarriage or the attainment of the age of 70, when normally an Old Age Pension would become payable.16. There are further to be considered the important categories of childless widows and of women who become widowed when their children have reached an age to support themselves. Con-tributions will have been paid by the husbands of all such widows, and in the great majority of cases will have been paid for many years. Where a widow has grown up children they will, in general, have their own responsibilities to bear and their ability to maintain her without assistance till she reaches 70 cannot reasonably be assumed. On the other hand, her industrial capacity will, as a rule, have long ago been lost. It would be impossible, in our view, to refuse a pension in such cases. More-over, in view of the consideration set out in the preceding para-graph, pensions payable to widows with dependent children will have to be continued after the children have ceased to be dependent. Differentiation between such widows and those whose husbands have survived till the children become self-supporting would not in our view be practicable.a:   224S6 B
Existing Widows and Children.17. No scheme of pensions for widows and orphans could, we think, be set up which did not make some provision for existing widows with children (and for children who had lost both their parents) at the commencement of the scheme. As no rights could accrue from contributions in such cases the provision to be made would be a gift at the cost of the State and would be justified on the grounds of the economic position of the class. The case of existing widows without dependent children is, however, different. Equally, no contributions will have been paid in respect of them and equally the justification for granting pensions to them must be sought in their economic circumstances. We do not think that in this case the grounds are sufficient. So far as evidence is available, very few of such widows find themselves compelled to have recourse to the Poor Law. Many of them have no doubt become accustomed to work for wages and we see no reason for disturbing the existing position so far as these women are concerned.Position of Widows at 70.18. A discussion of the proposed scheme for widows&apos; pensions would not be complete without reference to the position of widows in receipt of pension on attaining the age of 70. Unless provision is made to the contrary, such widows,, on attaining the age of 70, will continue to be entitled to pensions only in so far as they satisfy the conditions laid down in the Old Age Pensions Acts. Logically there appears to be no reason why a widow who has received the full pension to which she is entitled under the contributory scheme should not then fall back into the same position as other members of the com-munity and only become entitled to an Old Age Pension if she satisfies the existing statutory conditions. But it is doubtful if this logical position could be maintained. After a widow has been receiving a pension for a number of years it would be very difficult to apply conditions to the further receipt of a pension which might have the effect of reducing its amount or taking it away altogether. In other words a woman might be confronted at the advanced age of 70, when her capacity for earning money must be negligible, with the withdrawal or reduction of assistance of which she may have been in receipt for many years and by reference to which her standard of living has probably been fixed. In these circumstances it would seem impossible to withhold the payment of an old age pension at the maximum rate, from widows on attaining the age of 70 who have been receiving a. widow&apos;s pension. It will be noted that the difference in this respect between the treatment of widows of similar economic position who come within the scheme of contributory pensions and those who do not will be minimised in so far as the existing means qualification is modified by the legislation now in prospect.
General Scope and Conditions oe Eligibility por v- Pension.19. In the foregoing paragraphs we have discussed what appear to be the underlying principles and main features of a practicable scheme of widows&apos; and orphans&apos; pensions. The remaining paragraphs of this part of the report contain the broad outlines of a scheme embodying these principles, including estimates of the prospective cost.20. Benefits should be provided under the scheme for widows up to the age of 70 and for children up to the age of 16 of men who at the time of their death possessed insured status and satisfied the conditions as to payment of contributions and duration of insurance under the Health Insurance scheme as conditions of eligibility for disablement benefit. Widows of contributors, with or without children, should be eligible. The widow&apos;s pension should cease on re-marriage, but payment of children&apos;s allowances should continue until the children reach the age of 16. The mother&apos;s pension should be payable in addition to the children&apos;s allowances, to families of orphan children, where the mother if alive would have been eligible for pension, payment being continued until the youngest child reaches the age of 16.21. Contributions should be payable concurrently with and under the same conditions as health insurance contributions throughout employment to the age of 70 in respect of all insured men (or to 65 if a contributory scheme of old age pensions on the lines suggested in Part II. of this Report is adopted). This class includes all the men (save officers) serving in the armed forces of the Crown. For health insurance purposes the whole contribution of a soldier, sailor or airman is paid from public funds, the man being, himself, free of contributions until he becomes employed after discharge. The position in regard to the new contribution, so far as concerns this class, would be for discussion with the -Departments concerned. It is sufficient for present purposes to say that contributions from this class, consisting mainly as it does of unmarried men, could not be foregone without imposing a higher contribution on the men of the civilian population than is named in this Report.Position of Special Classes oe Contributors.22. In drawing up estimates of prospective cost, detailed consideration has necessarily been given to the position under the scheme of certain special classes of persons, both contributors and beneficiaries.As regards contributors (men in employment) special treat-ment appears necessary in the case of the following classes: (a) Men  leaving  insurable  employment  and  ceasing therefore to be compulsoriij? insured.B 2
We contemplate that such men, if qualified under the &apos; National Health Insurance scheme, should be permitted to continue as voluntary contributors towards widows&apos; pensions, provided that at the same time they continue in insurance under the Health Insurance scheme (and, if a contributory Old Age Pension scheme is adopted, under that scheme).(6) Men who have left insurable employment before the inception of the scheme and have not continued in insurance as voluntary contributors.A special concession appears necessary in order to avoid the risk of creating a grievance in these cases. Such men should, we think, be given an option, to be open for a limited period (say, 2 years), to enter the scheme (fox-health insurance and widows&apos; pensions) as voluntary contributors, subject to the further condition that they should contribute for a minimum period of two years before their survivors became entitled to benefits.(c) Men in &quot; excepted &quot; employment under the Health Insurance scheme :This class consists chiefly of school teachers, employees of the Crown and of local authorities where the conditions of service are presumed to make health insurance unneces-sary, and of clerks and salaried officials of railway and other statutory companies entitled to benefits from super-annuation funds. Except for a few highly-paid manual workers, the class is confined to persons remunerated at a rate not exceeding  250 a year, but is numerically con-siderable. We think that the men included in it should contribute towards widows&apos; pensions save in so far as their existing conditions of service include statutory rights to benefits for widows and children. So far as we are aware this obtains only in the case of the police.Position of Special Classes of Beneficiaries.23. As regards beneficiaries (widows and children) special treatment appears to be necessary in the case of the following classes of persons : (a) Widows and orphans (other than war pensioners) at the date of the inception of the scheme.Provision should be made under the scheme for the inclusion of those widows with children under 16 who would have been qualified in respect of their husband&apos;s insurance had the scheme been in operation prior to his death. Similarly provision should be made for existing orphan children. We do not contemplate any provision for existing widows without children.
(6) Widows in receipt of compensation for the death of their husband through industrial accident.Pension, for which the employed husband would have contributed, should logically be payable irrespective of compensation paid by the employer. If, however, con-tributions were levied upon employers this position would need reconsideration. A possible solution might be found by limiting the grants to be made under the pension scheme to the pensions payable to the widows themselves, children&apos;s allowances being withheld on the ground that adequate provision was already made under the Workmen&apos;s Com-pensation scheme.Widows and Children in Receipt oe War Pensions.24. Widows and children in receipt of war pensions should be excluded from the scope of the scheme. Adequate provision is already made for them by the State.Other Special Classes oe Persons.25. Under various proposals which have been put forward on the subject of pensions for widows, payment of pension to the following classes of persons has been suggested : (a) Women whose husbands are prevented by illness or total disablement from following any regular occupation;(6) Separated and deserted wives (prior to death of husband);(c) Unmarried mothers (both before and after the death of the father);(d) Divorced women.Payment in these cases has usually been advocated in con-nection with schemes for non-contributory pensions at the sole cost of the State, and has been coupled with proposals which contemplate a good deal in the way of supervision and inspection. Provision is already in fact made for the first category under the Health Insurance and Workmen&apos;s Compensation schemes and it appears to us that any extension of provision for such cases which may be thought necessary should be made within the framework of those schemes. As regards women in the three remaining classes, it would be wholly inappropriate and impracticable to make provision for them by a contributory system on a contractual basis. It is, moreover, far from being the case that no provision exists for these classes. The law already recognises the need for financial provision in proper cases, and it is important that the responsibilities of the husband or father now enforceable by means of maintenance or affiliation orders should not be weakened.
Rates of Pension and Allowance.26. The pension payable to a widow should, we suggest, be at the same rate as that of maximum old age pension after 70 (and of contributory pension between 65 and 70 if a contributory pension scheme is adopted). As regards children&apos;s allowances we have followed the principle of providing a higher rate of allowance for the eldest child under 16.-27. The estimates of cost given below have been worked out on the basis of a grant of 10s. per week to a widow payable until the age of 70, of 5s. per week to the first child and of 3s. per week to each other child in a family. It is evident that under our proposals for the continuance of the widow&apos;s own pension after her children have ceased to be dependent, the amount of the pension cannot exceed 10s. without raising the question of increasing the old age pension.Rates oe Contribution.28. The estimated weekly rate of contribution to cease at 70 which would be required in respect of an employed man at age 16 to provide benefits of the amounts and under the conditions set out in the preceding paragraphs would be 8^d. This estimate is based on the assumption that insured persons who cease to be employed will continue in insurance as voluntary contributors. The estimate given is that of the total contri-bution required; we have not considered it to be part of our duty to make suggestions as to the possible allocation of this contribution between employers and employees. It is not suggested that the State should pay any part of this contribution as it will be shown later that without any such payment the State will incur a capital liability under the scheme of 370 million pounds.Number oe Beneficiaries.29. We give below a table setting out the estimated numbers of beneficiaries under the scheme at a mean date in each of certain future years on the assumption that the scheme will start on 1st January, 1925. Owing to the great labour involved in the calculations, the estimates have not at present been carried forward to a later year than 1950. It will, however, be seen that up to that year the estimated numbers of beneficiaries grow with regularity and it must be assumed that for a considerable subsequent period they will continue to grow. Thus neither as regards numbers nor cost do our estimates show the full burden of the scheme when it reaches maturity. As regards widows with children under the age of 16 in Great Britain (other than war widows) on 1st January, 1925, we have assumed that 80 per cent, of the number would satisfy the test of eligibility (see para. 20) which we have proposed should be applied.   As regards persons

(1) In the above tables the widows&apos; allowances include the 10s. per week paid to families where both mother and father are dead.(2) The figures as to expenditure do not include the additional cost of old age pensions arising from the disregard of the means qualification in the case of widows who up to age 70 have received a widow&apos;s pension.31. It will be seen from the above tables that income would exceed expenditure for the first few years, but that from 1930 onwards the excess of expenditure over income would increase rapidly. As previously indicated, moreover, the cost would continue to grow for a long period after 1950.
The excess of expenditure over receipts is due, first, to the liability in respect of non-contributory cases and, secondly, to the fact that the proposed contribution of 8^d. per week would be sufficient only at the age of 16. For the 10 to 11 million men of all ages from 17 to 70 who would be brought within the scheme at the beginning, the benefits would be worth considerably more than this contribution. It is sufficient to illustrate this to say that for men of 20 years of age when contributions begin the benefits would be worth a contribution of lO^d. a week ceasing at the age of 70; for men of 30, is. 4d. a week; for men of 40, is. 9d. a week, and for men of 50, 2s. 3d. a week.32. The liability in respect of existing widows with children and the liability due to the difference between the contribution of 8jcz. and the contribution which would be appropriate to persons aged over 16 at the commencement of the scheme represents the charge which would in any event have to be borne by the State, for it would be impracticable either to have varying contributions or to charge the entrant at age 16 more than the rate required actuarially to cover the risks in his case. This liability, when capitalised, would amount to 108,000,000?. in respect of existing widows with children and to 262,000,000l (on the &quot; without lapse &quot; basis) in respect of contributors between the ages of 16 and 70. The latter amount would be equivalent to an additional contribution from the State of 8^d. per week in respect of every insured man included under the scheme at the beginning. In these circumstances we do not think that it would be practicable to finance the scheme on a funding basis and we contemplate that contributions towards it would merely be applied in reduction of the charge on the Exchequer under the scheme.machinery oe administration.33. We have not felt called upon to make detailed proposals as to the machinery to be used for the administration of the scheme, and in the following paragraphs we have confined our-selves to an indication of the general lines which we think might be followed in a further examination of this aspect of the scheme. Officers of the various Departments concerned are now engaged in this task.34. Under our proposals for linking up the scheme with the National Health Insurance system the information in regard to insured status required in dealing with claims to pension would generally be provided by the central records maintained by the Ministry of Health and Scottish Board of Health. Reference to the Approved Society of which the claimants husband or father was a member would sometimes be required, but save to this very limited extent it would not be necessary to impose any burden on Approved Societies in respect of the administration of the scheme. .
t35. As stated above, contributions would be applied in reduction of the charge on the Exchequer under the scheme. Such contributions could be collected concurrently with health insurance contributions by the sale of stamps through the Post Office, single stamps being used for combined contributions under the two schemes. The Post Office would determine the receipts from the sale of stamps attributable to contributions under the widows&apos; pension scheme and would credit theExchequer with the appropriate sums. No interference with the present methods of handling health insurance cards would be involved.36. Applications for pension should, we think, be made through the Post Office who should furnish applicants with the necessary form of claim. This, when completed, should be forwarded to the Central Authority together with such marriage, death and birth certificates as might be required to substantiate the claim. The decision as to the award of pension should be made by the Central Authority after consulting the Health Insurance records and after such local investigation as might be necessary. Pay-ment of pension should be made through the Post Office.PART II.-CONTRIBUTORY OLD AGE PENSIONS COMBINED WITH WIDOWS&apos; AND ORPHANS&apos; PENSIONS.Introductory.37. In our first Interim Report we confined ourselves in the main to a review of possible changes in the system of old age pensions which might be made without affecting the non-con-tributory basis of the existing scheme. On a further considera-tion of the estimates then presented of the cost of various changes which have from time to time been suggested, we have been forced to the conclusion that, as in the case of widows&apos; pensions, important developments of the existing Old Age Pension scheme on a non-contributory basis would be so costly that the necessary funds for carrying them through could only be found at the risk of stopping social development in other directions. For example, the additional cost to the State of increasing the old age pension to 15s. per week, keeping the age limit at 70, is estimated at  13 million in 1925, and of combining this change with the lowering of the age limit to 65 at  32 million, on the basis of the existing means qualification. A relaxation of the means test would, of course, increase the additional cost, which in any case would greatly increase in future years. In regard to old age pensions we have therefore turned our attention to the possibility of formulating proposals involving the contributory principle.38. In our Interim Report we referred in general terms to the possibility of substituting a contributory system of old age pensions for the existing non-contributory scheme.   We then
L- 17reached the conclusion that the complete substitution of a con-tributory for a non-contributory scheme was not a practicable C. proposition, whether the contributory scheme was on a voluntary or compulsory basis. It appeared to us that in the light of the experience of friendly societies in the field of voluntary insurance, a State-aided scheme of voluntary insurance against old age stood no chance of success. Again, for practical reasons a compulsory scheme could only be applied to the employed population  that is to say, only to a section of the prospective beneficiaries under the existing scheme of free old age pensions, and we feel that it would be impossible to restrict in this way the class to whom pensions are payable under the existing scheme. It is sufficient to show the importance of this class to say that it includes a large number of women of the industrial community who reach the age of 70, being neither themselves insured nor the wives of insured men. We have therefore reached the conclusion that the present &quot; need &quot; pension on a non-contribu-tory basis must continue in order that the many non-insured persons who now qualify for old age pension may still do so.39. We gave preliminary consideration also to the possibility of setting up a contributory scheme side by side With the existing free scheme,&apos; to apply to persons of 70 and over. We reached the conclusion that if such a scheme were set up it would be inequitable for the State to treat the employed population less generously than the non-employed, and that it would therefore not be right to restrict the benefits of the existing non-contribu-tory scheme to persons who would not be entitled to pension under the contributory scheme, i.e., to the non-employed popu-lation. In other words, contributions under a scheme to provide pensions for persons of the same age as present beneficiaries under the Old Age Pension scheme could only be considered as a possible basis for contractual payments supplementary to existing free pension.40. A proposal to grant supplementary pensions at 70 in return for compulsory contributions would probably be adduced, however, as proof that the current scale of free pension was inadequate and might stimulate a demand for a revision of the scale of free pensions in an upward direction. This in turn would lead to a demand for a corresponding increass in the amount of widows&apos; pensions which, under the scheme set out in Part I. of this Report, would be at the maximum old age pension rate. In these circumstances we feel unable to recom-mend the adoption of any scheme providing for the payment of additional benefits in return for contributions to members of the employed population over 70 years of age.Contributory Pensions between 65 and 70.41. It appears to us that if any important extensions of existing forms of provision against old age are to be made, they
should take the shape of a contributory and compulsory scheme under which pensions on a contractual basis would be paid to members of the employed population at an earlier age than &quot; need &quot; pensions under the existing Old Age Pension scheme. The following paragraphs contain proposals for the provision of pensions on a contributory basis for employed persons between the ages of 65 and 70.42. The proposals contemplate a scheme combined with the Health Insurance and Widows&apos; Pensions schemes under which contributions would be paid concurrently with contributions for health insurance and (in the case of men) for widows&apos; pensions, and a prescribed period of insured status immediately prior to the attainment of the age of 65 would be required as a test of eligibility for benefit. The same concessions should be made as regards voluntary insurance in continuation of compulsory in-surance and as regards the entry into the scheme as voluntary contributors of persons who had left insurable employment before the commencement of the scheme as are suggested in the scheme for widows&apos; pensions. (See Part I., paras. 9 and 10.) We contemplate also that contributions will at all stages be com-pulsorily linked up with contributions towards health insurance and, in the case of men, towards widows&apos; pensions.43. The provision of contributory pensions at 65 would effectively meet, in respect of the employed class, a criticism directed against the existing scheme that the qualifying age for pension is too high and that the scheme fails to give the needed relief to Workers whose value as industrial units has begun to be seriously impaired by age. There appears to be considerable force in this criticism. Apart from the obvious incapacity of large numbers of persons approaching 70 years of age to follow exacting occupations in which they have spent their lives, added to the natural difficulties such persons experience in adapting themselves to new callings, we have had before us some interesting concrete evidence on this subject collected as a result of a sample investigation into the personal circumstances and industrial history of 10,000 claimants to unemployment benefit, undertaken in November last. This enquiry showed that the percentages of unemployed persons of 60 and over who were considered to be verging on the unemployable were: males, 17-6 per cent, and females, 30 - 8 per cent. The corresponding percentages for workers of all ages were 3 - 5 per cent, and 1 - 8 per cent, respec-tively. It seems at least to be probable that the payment of a pension between 65 and 70 would be more beneficial to the community than an increase of the present pension for persons over 70.44. It is true that a proposal to provide contributory pensions at 65 for the insmed class might stimulate the existing movement for non-contributory pensions on a widened basis at a lower age than 70.   The answer to any such demand would be that, as
already pointed out, any non-contributory scheme of this kind would involve the State in huge financial liabilities which would endanger other social schemes.45. A scheme providing contributory pensions for persons between 65 and 70 could also be linked up to great advantage with the existing Old Age Peiision scheme. We discussed in our previous Report the contention that the means limit under the present system was a penalty on thrift and that the methods of administration were inquisitorial and akin in spirit to Poor Law methods and we pointed out that it would not be possible to meet these complaints in regard to a non-contributory scheme without imposing grave new financial burdens on the Exchequer. We think, however, that a contributory scheme, providing benefits at 65 (at which age we contemplate that contributions and cash benefits under the Health and Unemployment Insur-ance schemes would cease in respect of beneficiaries under the pension scheme), offers an opportunity of meeting the com-plaints so far as they relate to persons who for a substantial period of their lives have been in employment and have through their contributions to insurance funds been relieving the community by co-operative effort of charges which might otherwise have fallen upon it. To this end we suggest that all persons who have been beneficiaries under a contributory pension scheme to the age of 70 should be entitled to free pension from 70 onwards irrespective of means. For reasons similar to those set forth in paragraph 18 above with regard to widows&apos; pensions, this would appear to be an inevitable consequence of the adoption of a scheme of contractual pensions prior to age 70. It has not been possible to form any precise estimate as to the extent to which the charge for old age pensions at 70 would be augmented by the proposed change but probably it would not be great and would be offset in considerable measure by the reduction of the Stat? grants to National Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance consequent upon the termination of benefits under these schemes in the circumstances discussed in the following paragraph.40. if a pension at 65 were provided on a contributory basis, insurance under the National Health system, save for medical benefit which continues during life, should terminate at that age instead of at 70 as at present. The heaviest liability under the Health Insurance system between the ages of 65 and 70 is that arising in respect of disablement benefit, for which the pension would obviously provide a complete substitute. If the scope of health insurance were thus contracted any disadvantage which a section of the insured may suffer at present through the lapse of compulsory insurance between the ages of 65 and 70 as a consequence of the termination of employment would disappear. Unemployment insurance should also terminate at 65 and at this age, consequently, contributions for both health p,nd unemploy-
merit insurance would cease. The contribution for pension would naturally cease when the pension began. The termination of the contribution for widow&apos;s pension at the age of 65 would be a necessary corollary to these conditions.47. There is, moreover, an independent advantage in the association of contributory pensions at 65 with a Widows&apos; Pension scheme. We propose that contributions under the Widows&apos; Pension scheme should be levied upon all men in insurable employment. Contributions, which would be at a relatively high rate, would therefore be paid by single men and widowers, who might leave no survivors to benefit under the scheme and it might be urged by some critics that such persons were being unjustly penalised. The scheme being one of insurance, such a criticism would not of course be sound, except, perhaps, as regards those widowers or single men of ages so advanced at the beginning of the scheme as to make remote their chance of leaving beneficiaries. Such a complaint, however, would be wholly untenable if the two forms of provision were closely linked up with one another and regarded (with the Health Insurance scheme) as parts of a single whole. In this case the benefits provided even for the single man or widower pension at 65 continued at 70 irrespective of means would be sufficiently substantial for persons entering at an advanced age to justify the full rate of contribution which the complete scheme would require.48. In discussing proposals for the establishment of a Widows&apos; Pension scheme (Part I., para. 12) we referred to the desirability of linking up contributions compulsorily at all stages with contributions towards health insurance. The maintenance of compulsory connection on similar lines between the Old Age Pension and the Health Insurance schemes becomes of special importance in view- of the proposed concession to beneficiaries under the Old Age Pension scheme on reaching 70. The right to free pension at 70 irrespective of means would be very attractive, while the contribution for pension alone between 65 and 70 would be relatively small. It is therefore desirable that the right to continue voluntarily in insurance for old age pension should be restricted as far as possible to those who are really in need of such provision and it would seem that this could in practice be effectively secured by requiring at the same time maintenance of insured status under the Health Insurance scheme (concurrently in the case of men with insured status under the Widows&apos; Pension scheme). This course has the additional advantage that it avoids the need for keeping separate contribution records for old age pension purposes.49. In preparing proposals for contributory pensions we have made provision for the inclusion of employed women. We are aware that the number of women over 35 insured under the National Health Insurance scheme is comparatively small (ranging from 22 per cent, of the total female population between
35-40 to 10 per cent, between ages 60 and 65), and that the disparity between the number of women within the scope of a contributory scheme and the number who would ultimately qualify for benefits would be marked. We think, however, that provision should be made for the benefit of single women employed till late in life and that the small contribution necessary for this purpose can, as a practical proposition, be imposed on all employed women.50. We contemplate also that, on the analogy of the proposals in respect of widows with children set forth in Part I. of this Report, provision would have to be made for the payment of pension from the outset to all persons between 65 and 70 who have had insured status under the Health Insurance scheme for at least five years immediately prior to the attainment of the age of 65.General Scope and Conditions of Eligibility for Pension.51. The following paragraphs set forth in greater detail proposals for contributory pensions between 65 and 70.52. Benefits should be provided for all persons between the ages of 65 and 70 (men and women) who have held insured status under the Health Insurance scheme for a period of at least 5 j^ears immediately prior to the attainment of the age of 65.53. Contributions should be payable concurrently with, and under the same conditions as, health insurance contributions from the age of 16 to the age of 65 in respect of men and women.Position of Special Classes of Persons.5-1. In drawing up estimates of prospective cost it has been necessary, as in the case of the scheme for widows&apos; pensions, to give detailed consideration to the position of certain special classes of persons, both contributors and beneficiaries. Special treatment of the following classes of persons appears to be necessary : (a) Men and single women leaving insurable employment before the age of 65.Such persons should be allowed to continue their insurance for old age pension, provided that they are qualified, and elect to remain insured for health insurance purposes (and in the case of men for the purpose of widows&apos; pensions).(b) Women on marriage.The conditions governing the position of married women under the Health Insurance scheme, both as contributors and beneficiaries, should be applied under the contributory
Old Age Pension scheme. Accordingly, women remaining in insurable employment on marriage should retain their insured status both as contributors and beneficiaries. Women leaving insurable employment on marriage, should, as at present for health insurance purposes, be ineligible to become voluntary contributors.(c) Widows.Widows under 65 in receipt of pension and in employ-ment should be exempted automatically from payment of contributions towards old age pension at 65, towards health insurance, and unemployment insurance.(d) Persons in &quot; excepted &quot; employment under the Health Insurance scheme.These persons should not be required to contribute towards an old age pension at 65, so long as the conditions of their employment include provision for superannuation at least as favourable as that made under the State scheme.(e) Persons aged between 65 and 70 at the commence-ment of the scheme.Pension should be paid to such persons from the outset provided they have had insured status under the Health Insurance scheme for 5 years immediately prior to the attainment of the age of 65.Accrued Rights oe Contributors towards Old Age Pension on leaving Insurance.55. We have given special consideration to the question whether any compensation should be paid under a contributory Old Age Pension scheme to persons who leave insurable employ-ment and elect not to continue as voluntary contributors, before reaching the age of 65. We conclude that it is neither practicable nor necessary to grant &quot; free &quot; policies for pensions of reduced amount at 65 to such persons.56. This withholding of compensation appears to be justifiable in the case of men if the scheme is regarded as one with the Health Insurance and Widows&apos; Pension schemes. The amount of the contribution charged for pension at 65 would form only a relatively small proportion of the total contribution charged under the combined scheme. It may be asserted, moreover, that, regarding the combined scheme as a whole, there is no ground for compensation in cases of voluntary lapse. Considering the type of benefit proposed to be included, it is doubtful whether the lapse of an unmarried man would relieve the scheme of any liability; for the time being it is clear that the cessation of his contribution would create a loss of revenue against which no relief would accrue. In the case of married men the position would be different the liability cancelled being  considerably greater than the contribution lost.   But
as regards men of this class the liability which will have rested on the scheme in the past will have been a considerably greater sum than the contributions have met, the difference having been provided partly out of the contributions of single men and partly by the State. Looking, therefore, at the circumstances in regard to all men, whether single or married, who may leave insurable employment, it is evidently arguable that no case for compensation arises if the individual elects in the exercise of his option not to be a voluntary contributor.57. As regards women (who would not contribute towards a widow&apos;s pension) the contributions of those who left insurable employment on marriage should be regarded as applicable towards the cost of the pensions of women who remain unmarried, and on this basis we are actuarially advised that the contributions of women in employment can be cut down to a very low level. It is evident that it would be impossible to make any distinction for the purpose of granting &quot; free &quot; policies between women who left employment as spinsters and those who left on marriage.Rate oe Pension.   .58. Pension at 65 should be at a flat rate irrespective of means. The rate should be equivalent to the maximum rate payable to persons of 70 and over, and to the rate of pension proposed in respect of a widow in her own right. In the estimates of cost given below a rate of pension of 10s. a week has been adopted as a basis.Rates of Contribution under combined Widows&apos; Pension and Old Age Pension Schemes.59. The total weekly contribution appropriate to the age of 16, in the case of men, which would be required to provide the combined benefits proposed under this scheme, and under the scheme of widows&apos; pensions, subject to the conditions set out in this Report, would be lid!. The weekly contribution appro-priate to the age of 16, which would be required from a woman to provide a pension under this scheme would be Id. These rates do not include any allowances for expenses of administration.co. For the purpose of estimating the contributions required specifically in respect of contributory old age pensions we have assumed that [a) As regards men, insurance will be continued voluntarily on the termination of insurable employment.(b) As regards women: (1) all insured women will continue in insurance during spinsterhood; (2) as in the estimates relative to the National Health Insurance scheme, a proportion, estimated at one-seventh of those women who marry, will continue in insurance; (3) insured women will cease to be insured on becoming widows and entering on the widow&apos;s pension.
61. As in the case of the proposals for widows&apos; pensions set forth in Part I. of this Report, we have not felt it to be a part of our duty to make any recommendations as to the possible allocation of contributions between employers and employees.Number oe Beneficiaries.62. The following tables give separately for men and women estimates of the number of beneficiaries under a contri-butory Old Age Pension scheme for certain future years. These estimates have been worked out, as in the case of the similar estimates in respect of pensions for widows and orphans on the alternative &quot; without lapse &quot; and &quot; with lapse &quot; bases.Men.

The additional contribution in respect of men and the contribution in respect of women required to provide pensions between 65 and 70 are appropriate (as in the case of widows&apos; pension contributions) to the age of 16. Additional liabilities (which would have to be borne by the State) would thus be created in respect of persons aged over 16 at the commencement of the Old Age Pension scheme and of insured persons aged over 65 to whom benefits would be paid from the outset.65. On the &quot; without lapse &quot; basis the liability in respect of the insured population under 65 who would be brought under
2fithe combined schemes as contributors at the outset would be 510,000,000Z. of which 264,000,000Z. relates to widows&apos; and orphans&apos; pensions and 246,000,OOOZ. to pensions at 65. This liability is equivalent to a State contribution for the existing insured population equal on the average to Is. 4^cZ. per week for insured men and toi^d. per week for insured women. To this amount must be added, first, a liability of 27,000,0002. in respect of persons aged between 65 and 70 who are insured for health insurance at the date of the commencement of the schemes (and who under our proposals would become entitled to a pension to age 70 and to widows&apos; and orphans&apos; allowances) and, secondly, the capitalised liability for the pensions of existing widows with children, amounting to 108,000,OOOZ. Thus the total liability of the State under the combined schemes capitalised on the without lapse basis would amount to 645,000,0002.66. The administration of such a system of old age pensions as that outlined above would present little difficulty. Thecollec-tion of contributions would proceed exactly as in the case of the scheme of widows&apos; pensions (Part I., paras. 33 to 36 above). The contributions would be paid into a central fund and title to benefit Would be determined by the Central Authority by reference to the health insurance records supplemented by evidence of age. The payment of the pension would be effected through the Post Office.PART III.-CONTRIBUTORY PENSIONS AT AGE 05 OR OVER TO THE WIVES OF INSURED MEN.67. We have considered, finally, a possible extension of the scheme of contributory old age pensions to make provision for insured men&apos;s wives not otherwise eligible for pension at 65 under the proposals discussed in Part II above. Provision for such persons could be made within the general framework of the contributory old age pension scheme at a relatively small additional cost and an extension of the scheme in this direction would, we think, go far towards meeting the criticism which might be levelled against the scheme on the ground that the benefits granted to persons within its scope were inadequate, in the case of married couples where the wife was not herself insured, by comparison with the benefits provided for married couples in similar circumstances of need under the existing old age pension scheme.68. We contemplate the provision of pensions, at a rate of 10s. per week, for the wives aged 65 or over of insured men who, on attaining the age of 65, are themselves eligible for a contribu-tory pension. If the wife were 65 or over at the date on which her husband became qualified for a contributory pension, the pension would be payable to her as from that date; if the wife
X- 27were under 65 when her husband became so qualified, the pension would be payable when she attained the age of 65. In either case the pension would terminate at 70 (unless she became a widow and so qualified for a widow&apos;s pension before reaching that age).69. Following the general lines recommended under Part I and II of this Report, a wife aged between 65 and 70 of a man who at the inception of the scheme is over 70, but was contributing for health insurance until the age of 70, should be entitled to a wife&apos;s pension till she reaches the age of 70; and, similarly, on reaching the age of 65, a woman who is under that age at the inception of the scheme, but is the wife of a former contributor to health insurance, then aged over 70, should receive a wife&apos;s pension if the husband is living.70. The additional contribution required to provide pensions of 10s. a week for wives under the conditions outlined above, would be approximately Id. per week. This would be levied in respect of the employment of insured men as an addition to the contributions proposed for contributory old age pensions and widows&apos; pensions and under the same terms and conditions as the contributions towards such pensions. The total contribution required in respect of an insured man under the combined schemes discussed in this Report would therefore amount to approximately Is. per week.Number of Beneficiaries.71. The following table gives estimates of the number of beneficiaries (wives of insured men) under the proposed extension of the contributory pension scheme for certain future years on the alternative &quot; without lapse &quot; and &quot; with lapse &quot; bases : Yeai\		Without Lap.se.
