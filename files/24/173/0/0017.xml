/. h Ani &apos;JsHDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.315(25).CABINET. WASHINGTON HOURS CONVENTION. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER 0* LABOUR.lt The Cabinet on the 8th April considered theReport of the Committee appointed to consider International Labour Policy (CP. 198/25) and had before them a memorandum in which I reviewed the position of the Washington Hours Convention.     The policy to be adopted in relation to that Convention was not considered by the Cabinet owing to lack of time, but it was agreed that in the course of the Debate on the Motion for the Adjournment the following day I should make a statement of general character, re-affirming the difficulties which have prevented ratification of the Cenvention, while at the same time expressing the Intention of the Government to co-operate to the fullest possible extent with the International Labour Office in carrying out the principles laid down in Part XIII of the Peace Treaty. 2.        Within the last few days circumstances have arisen which in my view, create a situation which It is necessary for the Government to consider with great care.    I bring forward the matter without as much notice as I should have liked to give because the Labour Party&apos;s Forty-Eight Hour Bill is to be debated on Friday next and because it seems to me that the circumstances to which I have referred above affect the terms of the statement which I shall have to make on behalf of the Government in the course of the debate *
3.The circumstances in question are ;-(1) The Shipbuilding Employera&apos; Federation, inputting before the Shipbuilding Trade Unions theneed for a joint enquiry into the conditions of the shipbuilding industry, used the followingphraseology -&quot;There is still another aspect which this Committee might consider.   Everyone in this room knows that in our principal industries a working week of 48 hours or less is universal.   It may be that we should ask our Government to take such steps as are open to them to bring to the notice of Foreign Governments that the standard of life for workers generally in Europe is going to be jeopardised if they cannot secure the observance of the 48 hours week in Holland and Germany.   We, in shipbuilding, are not asking you to go back to a longer working week, but the prejudice we suffer by the conditions on the Continent is very serious Indeed;(2) The Engineering Employers&apos; Federation last week in replying to a claim by the Unions for an advanceof wages, proposed, inter alia, an increase from47 to 50 hours per week and included in their statement the following paragraph(d) &quot;If foreign competitor nations effectively decrease their working hours so as to bring them into reasonable relation to the working week in this country, the arrangement now proposed could be reviewed&apos;.?ve) &quot;Meantime It Is suggested that a Joint Submission by the Federation and the Unions should be made to the Government, pressing upon them the necessity of taking suoh steps aB may be possible under the Peace Treaty or otherwise to secure an arrangement whereby the working hours of competitor nations on the Continent should be dealt with as indicated&quot;.4* Of these the latter is, of course very much themore important, having regard to the fact that it is accompanied by a definite proposal to lengthen the
present hours in the engineering trade.   Already there are clear Indications that the result of the Engineering Employers1 proposal is to arouse the Trade Union movement and there can he no doubt, I think, that the hours issue is one on which there is likely to be greater danger of joint action on the part of Trade Unions than on any other issue in the industrial world.   The Shipbuilding Trade Unions have accepted the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; proposal for a joint Committee and they have suggested that the Government should participate in the enquiry.   It is obvious, therefore, that at any rate so far as regards these two trades, the Government have to consider their attitude towards the Washington Con-vention from a new and rather different angle. 5.        As I indicated in the memorandum which was before the Cabinet on the 8th April, I have been considering whether it might not be practicable and to the advantage of British industry to utilise the Hours Convention (suitably modified) as a means of minimising foreign competition^ There is a feeling in the Trade Union world that a reversion in this country to a longer working, week would merely result in a further lengthening of hours on the Continent; whereas before the war normal hours in this country were 53 or 54 per week and on the Continent were more nearly 59 or 60, the introduction into this country immediately after the war of a working week of 47 or 48 hours established a new datum line,the hours on the Continent oomlng down to something not much above 50. It is arguable that an effort would be made to maintain the traditional differential, and that an increase here would sooner or later be followed by an increase abroad.-3-. i^y,^ ....... .....______________ . JSl
cd r &amp; 36, The move made by the Engineering and ShipbuildingEmployers constitutes a change in the attitude of Employers,     In effect it invites the Government to examine the question whether any progress can be made through some clear and precise International arrange-ment, either generally or in respect of particular industries, of a kind which, while safeguarding the position from the point of view of British industry by an arrangement for reducing hours on the Continent, avoids the necessity of trying to get (at the expense of grave industrial unrest) an increase in working hours in this country.7.     I suggest that the line to be taken in regard tothe Labour Party Bill on Friday should be(l) to distinguish between the bill and other methods of securing the objects of the Convention(2) to point out the objections to the Bill which have been urged from time to time - its rigidity, its Inapplicability to conditions on British railways, etc, etc., and to say that it is unacceptable on general grounds,(5)    to indicate that the attention of theGovernment has been directed to pronounce-ments made in two of the important industries of the country - pronouncements which create a situation which the Government must necessarily consider with great care, with a view to ascertaining whether it is practicable, (in consultation with the Governments of competing countries) to reach an agreement on the principles embodied in Part XIII of the Peace Treaty and the Washington Hours Convention,(4)    to suggest that no useful purpose would be served by seeking to reach a definite conclusion upon the Bill as it stands,8, If this policy is approved the best course wouldbe for the amendment to be talked out so that no
U ^ Odivision should be taken, either on the Amendment or the Bill.     Otherwise of course the Bill must be defeated; and its defeat might easily be open to misconstruction not only in this but in other Countries.(Intd),  A. S-M.Ministry of Labour. April 27th, 1925.
