This document is the property of His Britannic Majeaty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, June, 1925.SECRET.Copy No. ^ 0CP. 283 (25).THE CABINET.WIDOWS, ORPHANS AND OLD AGE contributory pensions BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I wish to lay the following considerations before the Cabinet with a view to provision 93 being made in the Bill for an increased contribution by sailors, soldiers and airmen for their 368: insurance. Originally, under the 1911 Insurance Act, sailors and soldiers paid their share of the contribution. The Admiralty and the War Office paid l\d., the man paid 1 %d., a total of 3d. After the war, the 3d. was raised to 4^d. (to be reduced to 3^d. under the Bill), and the whole 4Jd. is now paid by the departments. When unemployment insurance for the Services was introduced in 1920, the whole payment was placed on the &quot; employer &quot;.    12 is paid for each man on discharge.The new Bill leaves it open for&apos;the man to pay his share of the 9d., and it is agreed by the three departments that he shall pay his 4^d. What I wish to propose is that instead of paying 4^., he shall pay Id. a week as an inclusive contribution to the cost of his whole insurance, health, unemployment, old age, widows, &amp;c.The Admiralty and the Air Ministry, however, do not agree.If no more than 4^d. is paid by the man, the three departments will be paying about  1,050,000 per annum for insurance. The sailors, soldiers and airmen will be paying  275,000 per annum.If we raise the 4^. to Id., the three services will save  150,000 per annum, and the sailors, &amp;c, will pay  425,000 against  900,000.I suggest that provision be made in the Bill for the Id. rate.L. W.-E.The War Office, Dih June, 1925.(b25/17)   100   6/25   w.o.p.   18s5
