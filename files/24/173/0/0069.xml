W.S.C.isasury CHAMBERS. May 27th.  1925.
9 1 fti   di flUnemployment Insurance.I submit for consideration the results of certain calculations which,  following the meeting of the Cabinet Committee yesterday,  I have made with reference to. the contributions for Unemployment Insurance.I have assumed that the modifications of the Unemployment benefits which I have estimated on present unemployment experience to produce a reduction of  8,500,000 in the claims on the Fund will be adopted. These modifications are as foil; ws(i) The prolongation of the waiting period from 3 days to 6 days, (ii) The re imposition of the conditions affecting the following classes which were relaxed in February la24:-(a) Single persons residing with parents or relatives who can support them.(b) Married women living with their husbands who are in employment.(c) Persons who are working short time and whose Incomes are sufficient to justify the withholding of extended benefit(a) Certain classes of aliens, (iii)    Reduction of the rates of benefit in the case of single men from 18/- to 15/-,  and in the case Of single women from 15/- to 12/-;    the reduction to be applicable to covenanted or unccovenanted benefit.    Eo alteration to be made In the rates of benefit payable to married persons vith  or without children.
2oOne of the consequences of these changes is that the number on the &quot;live register&quot; would be reduced from the present figure of about 1,180,000 to about 1,100,000. I have assumed that it stays at this figure  (on the average) during 1926 and 1Q27 and is reduced to an average of 1,000,000 during 1Q28, the reduction of 100,000 being due,  as to 65,000,  to persons  over 65 who will cease to draw unemployment benefit  on becoming entitled to pensions, and as to 35,000, to an actual improvement in the unemployment position.      I have assumed that this improvement vd.ll continue so that the average numbers on the register will bein 1^29    950,000&quot; 1930    9 00,000&quot; ln31    850,000 and in 1932 and thereafter 800,000.-After making the reduction of  8,500,000 in benefit payments the total expenditure in 1926 is estimated to be  43,000,000-      Of this sum  4,000,000 represents the cost of administration and  500,000 interest on the debt. The actual expenditure on benefits is thus estimated to be  38,500,000.      This gives on the average of the 1,100,000 persons on the register  35 per person or  3,500,000 for each 100,000 persons.      On the foregoing basis as to the numbers unemployed the benefit expenditure would thus be

Worker     7d.        &quot;       &quot;      &quot; &quot; 9d; reduction 2d,Women.Employer 6d. instead cf the present 8d; reduction 2d* Worker     5d.      &quot; &quot;      &quot; &quot;       7d.    reduction 2d.Tiie State contribution is now 6fd. for a man and 5id. for a woman and fr cm January, 1928, when the Fund is to be relieved of liability in respect of persons over 65 is to be 5fd, for a man and 4-fd. for a woman until the end of the deficiency period. It has accordingly beer; taken as follows:In 1926-27, In 1928-51.for a man 8d. 7d.for a woman 6d. 5i&apos;d.From 1928, in the case of men, the contributions will thus consi of &quot;three sevenpences&quot; until the end of the   deficiency period, Until 1928 the Exchequer will pay a penny more, that is to say from 1926 the contribution from the Exchequer additional to that already provided by the Bill will be uniformly lid. a week for a man, and Id, a week for a woman, until the end of the
deficiency period.This extra contribution vv-ill represent about  2,,.250,000 a year on the average of the whole period up to 1931/ assuming that the deficiency period lasts so long.On the conditions above set out and making due allowance for the expected increase of the insured population the position of the Fund from year to year until 1930 is as follows :-  Millions.1T[ear.Benefit   Adminis-   Interest Total       Normal     Special DebtExpend!-   tration, on Debt.

The annual income on this bests will be approximately  33,000,000, and expenditure, on a &quot;live register&quot; of 800,000, will be  31,500,000.
Tho foregoing estimates depend of course upon the realisation of the assumptions made as to the numbers unemployed.      They follow the instructions contained in your Minute of the 24th instant, and while they are not quite tho same assumptions that I made for the pu.r-.-oso of estimating the contribution income of the Pensions scheme under the proposals of tho Bill, they have practically the same effect0(Intd. ) A.V/.V/.26th May, 19250Government Actuary&apos;s DepartmentB(Appendix follows).
