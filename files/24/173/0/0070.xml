Circulated  to  the  Cabinet, by direction, of: The Secretary of S&amp;ate for Foreign Affairs, [This Document is the Property of Hte Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 133 X &apos;5XT &quot;GERMANY.-   lX&apos;P-     26 8    (25))*))CONFIDENTIA^^^^^^^^ /[May 25, 1925.] Section 3.[C 7063/459/18]No. 1.Memorandum communicated informally by Mr. Austen Chamberlain to the French Ambassador on May 19, 1925, regarding certain Points in the French Draft Note of May 12, 1925,* on the subject of Security.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN is indebted to M. de Fleurian for the supplementary explanations of the French draft of the 12th May which he was so good as to communicate to the Foreign Office on the 18th May.t These explanations answer the various points which Mr. Chamberlain raised verbally with M. de Fleuriau on the 14th May on his first cursory perusal of the French draft.Whilst these supplementary explana-tions go far to clear up the particular points mentioned by Mr. Chamberlain, there are certain others suggested by a further study of the draft regarding which he is uncertain what exactly is in the mind of the French Government. In order, therefore, that the British Cabinet may be in a position to accord to the French draft that prompt and careful study which so important a document demands, Mr. Chamberlain takes advantage of M. de Fleuriaifs offer to supply any further explanations that might be needed in order to elucidate these further points which are set forth briefly below.Before passing to an enumeration of these points Mr. Chamberlain would like to emphasise, and M. de Fleuriau will naturally appreciate, that the present informal communication is made solely with the object of securing supple-mentary information for his use in ex-plaining the project to the British Cabinet. It must of course not be taken as in any sense a reply to, or final comment upon, the French draft of the 12th May; it does not pretend to deal with the questions of principle embodied in that draft, as to which the British Cabinet can naturally express no reasoned opinion until they have fully grasped the exact purport of the French proposals.The further specific points on whichTranslation of French Reply to Mr. Cham-berlains Informal Memorandum^ of May 19, 1925, regarding certain Points in French Draft Notet of May 12, 1925, on the subject of Security (com-municatecl by French Ambassador, May 25).BEFORE embarking upon a detailed reply to the various requests for enlighten-ment made by the British Government it is well to make the following remark : The French draft note is drawn up on the following plan: First of all come general observations and reservations comprised in the first two sections, then observations peculiar to the different questions and proposals contemplated by the German memorandum, the latter being the subject of sections 3 et seq.* ^Germany&quot; print, May 14, Section 1. * &quot; Geruicany &quot; print, May 19, Section 1.&quot;Germany&quot; print, May 18, Section 1. t &quot; Germany&quot; print, May 14, Section 3.[950 bb-3]
some additional elucidation would be of assistance are, then, the following : 1. The present draft, though in the form of a note from the French Govern-ment to the German Government, is so couched as to commit the Allied Governments concerned as a whole to the proposals which it contains. Is it the intention of the French Government that the note shall be an expression of the views of the French Government alone ? Or, as the present text infers, a communication to the German Government from the French Govern-ment, acting in concert with and in the name of the interested Allies ? The answer to the above question must largely determine the angle from which His Majesty&apos;s Government approach and eventually comment on the document.2. The third paragraph of the pre-amble refers to the desire of the Allies to give to the interested States supple-mentary guarantees of security &quot; within the framework of the Treaty of Ver-sailles.&quot; It is doubtful what exactly this phrase means; is it not, for example, perhaps a little misleading when applied to a proposal which, as His Majesty&apos;s Government understand it, is to be put forward as supplementary to and out-side the existing framework of the Treaty of Versailles ? It is presumably the intention of the French Government that the proposed pact shall not in any way weaken or infringe the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. But the phrase is not free from ambiguity, and Mr. Chamberlain would be grateful for such explanations as can be given him.3. The meaning of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Section II is distinctly obscure. For example, it is expressly stipulated in Section III that the pact shall not affect the clauses of the treaty con-cerning the Rhineland occupation or the execution of the provisions of the Rhineland Agreement; it is not under-stood what other provisions of the Treaty of Versailles the French Government can have in mind under Section II. It would be of assistance to learn what precise object the wording of Section II has in view, and what danger it is designed to avoid.1. The intention of the French G0-vernment was not to reply in the name of their allies, but in their own name in agreement with their allies.Such an agreement is necessary because the German proposal of the 9th February, 1925, is for the conclusion of a pact in which England and other allies would participate. That is why, when acknowledging the receipt of the German memorandum on the 20th February, the French Government in-formed Germany that they were sub-mitting it to their allies.From that circumstance has arisen the present exchange of views which will, so the French Government hope, result in establishing that community of views exists between the Allied Governments. The French Govern-ment are, moreover, ready to word the text of their note in such a way as to leave no doubt in this respect. They will therefore replace the expression &quot; the French Government and their allies &quot; or the term &quot; the allies &quot; by &quot; the French Government in agreement with their allies.&quot;2. By the words &quot; within the frame-work of the Treaty of Versailles &quot; the French Government meant to specify that the pact proposed by Germany cannot in any way contradict, infringe or weaken the Treaty of A7ersailles and represents an offer of complementary guarantees. The points which are defined by the French reply are to be found iu embryo in the Treaty or in the Covenant of the League of Nations.3. The object of Section II is to state a reservation of general scope concern-ing the whole of the clauses of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of the Peace Treaty so As to make it clear that the agreements contemplated in the German memorandum must not impair them in any way whatsoever. Especially is this the case with the clauses concerning frontiers and with the special provisions designed to ensure the observance of the treaty.The reservation thus stated in para-graph 2 is laid down in paragraph o, with special reference to the clauses
4. Mr. Chamberlain notes that the Trench Government welcome the sug-gesfcion of treaties of arbitration guarau-teeiug the peaceful settlement of juridical and political disputes. But what exactly do the French Government understand by the term &quot; arbitration&quot; in this re-spect ? Is it contemplated that there shall be a settlement of a judicial nature in every case to the exclusion, for in-stance, of the procedure of settlement by the council laid down by the Covenant of the League of Nations ? Or do the French Government include &quot; conoilia-tion &quot; in the general term &quot; arbitration &quot; used in their draft ?5. The French draft contains the phrase that the arbitration treaties &quot; should leave no room for coercive action save in case of failure to observe the provisions of the various treaties and agreements contemplated &quot; in their note of the 12th May. But even in the latter case the French Government can hardly contemplate actual coercive action without a preliminary reference to some procedure for peaceful settlement, such, for example, as the Council of the League of Nations, in accordance with the general provisions of the covenant ? This is an important point, and one on which Mr. Chamberlain would be more particularly grateful for further informa-tion.6. What  exactly  is   meant by . the phrase     &quot; the    joint    and severalguarantee &quot; which, under   the French[950 bb-31which do not directly concern the Allied Powers and thus specially covers Austria and Sleswig.In response to the earnest request made by Germany, both semi-officially and publicly, the French reply expressly makes no mention by name of Austria, Poland, &amp;c, as according to German politicians and diplomats such mention would have made it impossible for Ger-many to continue the negotiations.The French draft note then enters upon a discussion of each of the agree-ments contemplated in the German memorandum.It is for this reason that Section III, which relates to the project of a Rhine-land Pact, contains a passage expressly referring to the conditions of occupation of the Rhineland and the execution of the Rhineland Agreement.4. The French Government have taken the word &quot; arbitration&quot; in the most general sense, meaning by it an attempt to exclude solutions by force. As to the means of attaining this object, it is only during the negotiation of the eventual agreements that it will be possible to define them.In all cases the obligatory nature of settlement by peaceful means must be specially affirmed and enshrined.There is moreover no question of encroaching upon the prerogatives of the Council of the League of Nations.The only condition which appears essential to the French Government is that the pacific solution obtained shall have the character of an obligatory decision.5. It is necessary to distinguish two cases : -(1.) Failure to observe the conditions of treaties or agreements, other than treaties of arbitration, existing between the parties. In this case failure to observe the conditions of these treaties or agreements cannot give rise ipso facto to coercive action except in virtue of a special provision of the aforesaid treaties and agreements contemplating such action.(2.) Failure to observe arbitration treaties : the object of these is assuredly, .-; as has been said above, to exclude solutions by force ; but if such treaties are not observed it is necessary to recognise that their violation appears to be a possible justification for coercive action appropriate to the nature of the violation.6. (a.) By    &quot;joint    and    several guarantee &quot; is meant that the guarantee -is given by all the signatories   whoB 2
draft, is to be given to the contemplated arbitration treaties ? What actual obligation would devolve upon the guarantor? This is a point on which His Majesty&apos;s Government are in great doubt as to what is intended. Does such a guarantee involve an obligation on the guarantors to resort to force, and, if so, in what circumstances ?7. Again, the exact import of the reference in paragraph 3 of Section V to the existing rights and obligations of the Allied Powers under the Covenant of the League of Nations and the treaties of peace is not clear, and a more precise indication of the objects of this passage would be welcomed.8. What exactly does the French Government mean in Section VI by the phrase &quot;placed under the auspices &quot; of the League of Nations?. Is any pro-must in principle act together, but that each individual signatory is nevertheless bound to act even in the case where one or several of the co-signatories default: thus on the occasion of the violation of Belgian neutrality by Germany in 1914, Austria defaulted, but the other guarantors were bound to act and did not hesitate to honour their signature.(6.) A distinction must be drawn between a territorial guarantee and a guarantee given to an arbitration treaty. The first applies in case of the violation of a territory and necessarily involves resort to force in defence of that territory.The guarantee of an arbitration treaty, on the other hand, does not necessarily take that form. It infers any means, diplomatic or other, appropriate to the nature of the violation. We have purposely avoided defining its nature or extent. It goes without saying that in such a case each of the guarantors acts in such measure as he is able.If, for example, Germany were to violate the Arbitration Treaty with Poland, Great Britain could not be automatically drawn in to a greater extent than is involved, in the first place, by the guarantee which she has has given to the Arbitration Treaty under the conditions laid down above, and, in the second place, by her capacity as a member of the League of Nations. In return, France could not be deemed to violate the Rhineland pact if she should be called upon to help Poland (&quot;En revanche, la France ne pourrait pas se voir opposer le Pacte rhenan par le fait quelle pourrait etre appelee a assister la Pologne &quot;).This very example demonstrates the necessity of making simultaneous the eventual conclusion of a Rhineland pact with the conclusion of arbitration treaties between Germany and the neighbouring allied States, as indeed Germany her-self proposes.7. The preceding paragraph explains as requested the import and object of the third paragraph of Section V.In fact, if arbitration treaties were not concluded between Germany and the Allies who do not participate in the rhineland pact, this latter pact might be invoked by Germany to impede any assistance given to those Allied States in conformity with the Covenant of the League of Nations.8. In placing the whole of the guarantee pacts and agreements under the auspices of the League of Nations, it is not our object to, create for the other
-cedure thereby contemplated which would entail an obligation on the part of an individual member of the League who was not an actual signatory of the agreements reached ?Mr. Chamberlain feels sure that M. de Fleuriau will forgive his raising the various points set forth in the preceding para-graphs. His doing so does not necessarily mean that in the opinic n of His Majesty&apos;s Government it is desirable to amplify or modify the actual wording of the French draft. That can only be decided at a later stage. His present object is merely to learn for the confidential information of his colleagues and himself the precise import of the French proposals in order to remove any danger of a misunderstanding of the French draft of the 12th May before attempting to formulate the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government upon it.Foreign Office,&apos; May 19, 1925.members of the League of Nations the same obligations as for the signatories of the agreements. Our intention was merely to place the agreements to be come to under the high moral authority of the League of Nations in order to enable the League, in case of need, to establish the legitimacy of action under-taken in accordance with the terms of these agreements and the conformity of such action with the covenant, and the very principles on which the covenant rests.May 22, 1925.
