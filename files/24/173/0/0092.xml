J. H.12th June,  1925.
NOTE BY PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL ON THE PROPOSAL TO        8 51 REDRAFT THE FACTORIES BILL IN THE! FORM OF AN AMENDING BILL,The method of altering the law by an amending Bill and then proceeding by a second Bill to consolidate the law as so amended is frequently extremely convenient both from the Parliamentary and from a drafting point of view, but to attempt to achieve the objects aimed at by the Factories Bill by this method would be a task of almost insuperable difficulty having regard to the form in which the existing law is now enacted and to the changes proposed by the Bill. ,Leaving out of account machinery provisions and matters of minor detail,  the present law is contained in nine enactments, viz.Factory and Workshop Act,  1901. Notice of Accidents Act,  1906. Factory and Workshop Act, 1907.White Phosphorous Matches Prohibition Act,  1908. Factory and Workshop (Cotton Cloth Factories) Act, 1911. Police, Factories, &amp;c.   (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,  1916. Women and Young Persons  (Employment in Lead processes) Act,  1920.Employment of Women, Young Persons, and Children Act, 1920.. Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act,  1923.In these Acts there are altogether 195 sections which deal withfactories and workshops, and out of these no less than 162sections would require to be substantially altered by anyamending Bill.Moreover the existing law draws distinctions betweenfactories and workshops and between textile and non textilefactories, and accordingly some provisions of the existing acts relate only to faotories,  some relate only to workshops,and some both to factories and to workshops, and the regulationof the hour of employment in textile factories differs fromthat in force with respect to non textile factories.    Thesedistinctions the Bill proposes to abolish, and the newdefinition of the expression &quot;factory&quot; contained in the Billis so framed as to embrace factories and workshops alike, and,except where otherwise  (in a few instances) expressly provided,,-&apos;
the provisions of the Bill apply equally to factories of all descriptions.    It will he seen that the abolition of these distinctions, although it might itself be effected by a comprehensive clause in an amending Bill, would involve consequentially the whole structure of the Acts to be amended by the Bill  (including, for example, the relations of the local authorities to the administration of the Acts)0As an example of the difficulty of proceeding by way of an amending Bill it may be useful to compare Part IT. of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 with Part VI of the Bill as now drafted, each of whioh deals with the controversial topio of the employment of women, young persons and children.    Part II of the Act of 1901 contains 44 sections covering 34 pages of the Statute Book, whereas Part VI of the Bill contains 24 clauses covering 11 pagos of the Bill, and the provisions of the Bill are so different from those of the existing Act that- as a comparison of them will show clearly, amendment oould only be affected by a wholesale substitution of the new for the old.    Although this is perhaps the most patent example of the difficulty of drafting an amending Bill in this oase,  similar difficulties would be met with in almost every other part of the Bill.    Further - the Bill contains as many as 24 clauses and 38 subsections of other clauses which are new provisions and not amendments to the existing Acts at all.In addition to the foregoing considerations it is also perhaps worth mentioning that to draft the Bill in the form of an amending Bill, would incidentally have the effect of making a good many provisions appear to be new provisions whioh are not really new, for the Bill contains a good deal which although it is new to the Statute Book -is already oontained In numerous regulations and orders made under the existing Acts.An amending Bill would necessarily be unintelligible both to Parliament and to the interests affected except by constant
reference to the Acts amended and would be both cumbersome and lengthy, and in my opinion such a Bill would,, having regard to the way in which it would have to be  drawn, be likely to present almost if not quite as-.many opportunities for attack as the Bill now in,, draft.J , CtRANVILLE rah...
