They suggest that Dobbs might be informed and use information as he thinks fit, that His Majesty&apos;s Government are no less openly and infinitely more sincerely than Soviet Government interested in preserving Persian and Afghan independence, and that they are ready to include guarantee- to this effect in any agreement which it may be possible to conclude with.
