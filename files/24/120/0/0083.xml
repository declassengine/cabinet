(THIS DOCUMENT IS 2HE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO VERMEIL)CONFIDENTIAL CP.  683CABINET. LEAGUE   OP   NATIONS.THE COMMISSION ON AMENDMIflTS TO THE COVENANT. REPORT by M. QUINONES LE LEON. SPANISH REPRESENTATIVE. Alopoed by the Council in Paris on February 21,1921.(Circulated for information)The Seeretary-Goneralrs Memorandum regarding the appointment of the Commission instructed to examine the amendments to the Covenant, recapitulates, in full detail, and with all the requisite precision, the resolutions of the Assembly on this pointti and also the circumstances whioh gave rise to them.The Council is informed that the Assembly, after adopting the decision not to admit, nor even to discuss during its session, any amendment to the Covenant, agreed that all the amend-ments which had been propose! aud also any others which might be received before March Slot, 1921, should be submitted for consideration to a Commission which the Council would appoint with that object.It will, therefore, be the Council&apos;s duty at the present meeting to oarry out the speaial task with whioh it has been entrusted by tho Assembly.It can, and indeed must, act with the most complete and entire liberty in carrying out this duty;    there is indeed nothing In the resolutions of the Assembly, In respect of this matter, which limits its action;    nor is the manner in which it is to oarry out the task entrusted to it, in any way laid down.
It is, therefore, left to the free Judgment of the Coirieil to determine the equality and the number of the persons who are to constitute the Coomission, and also the procedure which is to be followed in selecting them.    The Council will also have to determine the scope of the task which, in p&apos;u:TJ.ance of the mandate which it has received from the Assembly, it will entrust to the Commission, which it is its duty -co organise.Finally, in view of the fact that in the current bu&apos;get of the League of Nations no credit has been allotted to meet the expenses of this Commission, it will also be the duty of the Council, in conformity with Article 6 of this budget, to decide all matters with regard to this unforseen expenditure.The Council will be guided by the ideas and tendencies which were eiriessed during the sitting of the Assembly, and which are those to which it must look for direction;   it will, therefore, presumably desire to appoint a3 members of this Commission persons, wno by their authority and their spsoial competence in internal lor.?! questions, by their knowledge of legal problems, and by their experience in politics, represent the different principles and the various conceptions which predominate in the world with regard to matters of this kind; at the saie time the Council will be careful to form a Commission whioh shall not possess an unduly large number of members, as this would, without doubt, tend to hamper its labours and make the solution of the/j a matter of difficulty. With regard to the powers which should be conferred upon it, it is dear that these whould be of a purely advisory nature.However, as its powers are of this nature and in view of the object for which the Commission was set up, it would seem advisable that it should enjoy the most complete freedomZ
In order to examine, in the for;1: and manner which it may consider to &quot;be    the most suitable, both the amendments which have been hitherto proposed and those amendments which will be submitted to it in due course, as well as any others which may ,be suggested by an examination of the Covenant or by circumstances in general.To sum up, tho Commission night extend its report so as to include all ref ores of a constitutional&apos; character, ,. t&apos; I way be allowed this expression, which it might consider to be relevant.In this way the work of the Commission - which would be in accordance with the intentions of the Assembly when it decided upon its institution - will be  useful contribution , which will be appreciated in the last resort by those who alone -ire rualified to amend the Covenant by virtue cf the provisions in its Article 26.Finally, it is essential that the Council should be prepared to take the necessary measures with a view to meeting the expenses which will naturally be incurred by the working of thiiCommission and the payment cf which will have to be borne by the league   Nations. .It has already been said that the ,J-&apos;h:i.rd Budget, approved by the Assembly, makes no provisions which would allow this obligation to be fulfilled.On the other hand, this Budget lays down in Article 5 , already referred to, that no unfor^ ,een expenditure may be incurred unless authorised by a special resolution of the Council which must at once be brought to the knowledge of all the Members of the league of Nations.This is the position in which the Council finds itself now     with regard to the working of the Commission which we
are discussing arid whose institution wag due to a resolution of the Assembly.   It would be   possible to include the expenses of this Commission among the unf reso znexpenditure incurred for the special Commission referred to in Article 27 of Section 2 of the present Budget.It is impossible to fix beforehand the amount of the credit y-Tnich would   e necessary in order to carry out this obligation, but it would be possible, in accordance with the proposal of the Secretariat General, to authorise the latter to make the expenditure which this service will require and to fix now the emoluments which vail have to be given to the Members of the Commission.In pursuance of these considarations, I submit for tho approval of the Council the following Resolutions:Whereas the Assembly, in a xiesolution adopted on December 2nd,^.920, invited the Council to appoint a Commisoioi: to examine the proposed amendments to the Covenant, THE COUNCIL Oi1 Till LEAGUE 0^ NATIONS DECIDES that a Commission of 11 members shall &quot;be appointed to examine the proposed amendments to the Covenant and certain relevant questions submitted by the Assembly to the said Commission, as well as anjr other proposals concerning amend-ments to the Covenant which might be submitted by any liember of the League up to   arch 31st, 1921, inclusive, being the date fixed by the Council.   The. Council will also examine, on its own initiative, such proposed amendments - to the Covenant as it may think fit to examine and all ouest.io.ns of this kind, that the Council might submit to it at any   fu cure date.   It will submit its first report to the Council en June 1st, 1921, at the latest.
