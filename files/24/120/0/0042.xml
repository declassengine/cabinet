W.-E.The War Office,mh February, 1921.Summary of the Report of Lord Midleton&apos;s Committee.(The references in brackets are to the paragraphs of the Report.)1. The Committee assume that a sum not exceeding 300,000/. will be authorized for expenditure on Memorials, in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet (45/20) dated 4th August, 1920.   (Paragraph 11.)2. In Flanders the Menin Gate at Ypres should be adopted as the site for a Memorial to the Troops of the Empire; its architectural treatment might appropriately be in the form of an archway, the cost of which should not exceed 150,000/., to which contributions of, say 50,000/. in all will be invited from India and the Dominions. (Paragraphs 5 and 11-12.)3. In France a Memorial to the Troops of the United Kingdom should be erected at La Ferte-sous-Jouarre on the Marne to commemorate the first defeat of the Germans there in 1914, and a second Memorial at Amiens as being the most central point whereat to commemorate the rest of the fighting in France.   (Paragraph 23.)4. Commemorative Tablets should be placed in some of the Cathedrals in the area in which British troops operated, and possibly a somewhat more conspicuous Memorial in the Cathedral at Arras.   (Paragraph 27.)5. With regard to the submission of designs for the Memorials, open competition should be adopted in all cases, and the terms of the competition should be drawn up by an assessor or assessors in consultation with the Office of Works and submitted to the Committee. In this connection the Treasury should arrange for preliminary expenses. (Paragraph 31.)6. The Office of Works should prepare the necessary surveys of the sites at the Menin Gate and La Ferte-sous-Jouarre, and ascertain what site is available at Amiens. (Paragraph 34.)7. With regard to Gallipoli, the Committee defer making a recommendation pending a report on possible sites which is awaited from Lieutenant-General Sir Aylmer Hunter Weston, K.C.B., D.S.O., who is proceeding to Gallipoli shortly for private purposes.   (Paragraphs 29 and 30.)8. As arrangements are being made for the erecfcion of Memorials at Salonika and Palestine by the troops that fought in these battle areas, and as in Mesopotamia, Memorials have already been erected by the British and Indian troops, the Committee require instructions as to whether other Memorials should be erected in these places at public expense.   (Paragraph 28.)9. An announcement to Parliament should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government. (Paragraph 34.)(1321/105)   100   3/21  H&amp;S,Ltd  8984wo

REPORT OP THE NATIONAL BATTLEFIELDS MEMORIALCOMMITTEE.1, In presenting their report the National Battlefield Memorials Committee deem it advisable to Origin of the explain the causes which led to its formation, arising as they did from certain considerations additional Committee, to those of sentiment and the natural desire to commemorate the battlefields upon which the British Army fought during the late war.2. So far as United Ivingdom troops are concerned, it has hitherto been left to the initiative of Individual individual units to commemorate, if they wish, their own exploits by the erection, at their own memonals. expense, of memorials on their battlefields, the necessary negotiations with the French and Belgian authorities being carried out through a committee of which the Adjutant-General is Chairman.3. This Committee found that many very distinguished units would thus never be commemorated Many unitsowing to lack of funds, from which other units, with strong financial and territorial associations, do not uncom-sufferi mem orated.4. Further, the Government of the Dominions have already arranged to spend very considerable Action by sums of money on memorials to their troops in France and Flanders.   Australia has already erected the memorials at Polygon Wood and on the Hindenburg Line, and proposes to spend a further 100,000/. as   j^^f a general Australian memorial at Villers-Bretonneux.   Canada has voted a million dollars, and a Special Commission under a Brigadier-General is now engaged upon the work of erecting five memorials to Canadians in France and Flanders.   South Africa has bought Delville Wood, and New Zealand and Newfoundland are engaged upon memorials on various battlefields.   India has also decided to spend some 10,000/. on memorials to Indian troops in various parts of the world.5. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the above facts and it was represented to them that Pants placed it would only be consistent with the dignity of the British Government that it should not fall behind ^0.re tne the Dominions and India in paying homage to the Army and its exploits on the field of battle, and a a ine -scheme for rebuilding the Menin Gate at a cost of approximately 300,000/. was submitted to the Cabinet as a suitable form which the National Memorial should take.The selection of Ypres as the site for the main memorial was made for the following reasons:   Choice of ypres for(i.) Practically every division on the Western Front passed through Ypres at one time or the major another. memorial.(ii.) In its immediate neighbourhood there was continuous fighting from the beginning to the end; it was the scene of three desperate battles in 1914,1915 and 1917, and was the starting point of the great advance in the north in October, 1918.(iii.) Its defence stands to the British Army as that of Yerdun is to the French: Ypres and Yerdun are the only two towns that His Majesty has decorated with the Military Cross.(iv.) Many thousands of men lost their lives in the salient.6. The Adjutant-Generals Committee referred to in paragraph 2 had made some preliminary Selection of investigations regarding the possibility of Ypres as a site for a National Memorial, and an agreement the Menin had been reached with the Belgian Government in 1919 that the Menin Gate and the Eamparts were Gate-to be left in their ruined state pending the decision of the British Government as to a scheme for their reconstruction as a National Memorial.   This Committee had also considered the possibility of the Grande Place at Ypres as,a site and some reconstruction of the Cathedral or Cloth Hall, but the two latter alternatives have been abandoned, as they are less significant for the Army than the Menin Gate, and moreover the cost of rebuilding the Cloth Hall and the Cathedral should more appropriately be paid by those who destroyed them, viz., the Germans.7. The Government accordingly at the end of 1919 decided in principle that public money should Proposalsbe devoted to this purpose, and appointed the present Committee to make recommendations. approved in principle by the Gov-n rm   n f     i      ! -in 11 ernment.8. The Committee were faced at the outset with four main problems :(i.) The precise object which was to be commemorated.(ii.) The amount of money that should be spent, (iii.) The number of memorials to be erected, (iv.) The sites upon which they should be erected.9. (i.) Objects. The principal object was to commemorate fighting on battlefields, but as the Objects to be Dominions had already made extensive preparations to commemorate their own exploits, the question commem-arose as to whether the memorials to be erected should include or exclude them.   The sense of the ora 6 &apos; Committee was that while individual Dominions and units naturally would wish to commemorate in their own way the exploits of their troops, consideration of sentiment and. history were strongly in iavour of at least one general memorial at some outstanding locality which would serve to(8984) a. 2
Financial question.commemorate in an adequate manner the actions of the troops of the whole Empire, and that the memorials erected elsewhere should commemorate the troops of the United Kingdom. There would thus be a single Imperial monument commemorating the unity of the Empire, together with individual memorials representing the individual countries.10: (ii.) The amount of money that should be spent. The Committee feel that it was a matter of difficulty to fix upon a sum that would provide for memorials adequate to the dignity of the Empire and yet would not appear extravagant at a time when economy was so urgent.The figure of 300,000/. originally suggested for the rebuilding of the Menin Gate at Ypres appeared very high when it was remembered that only 10,000/. was spent on what after all will prove to be the most visible and accessible memorial of the war, namely, the Cenotaph, in Whitehall. At the same time for the British Army Ypres stands alone as a scene of action, and the memory of its action should he worthily commemorated in stone. The Committee have as one of their members Sir Aston Webb, P.R.A., and they had the advantage of the opinion of the President as the Royal Institute of British Architects and Mr. R. J. Allison, one of the chief architects of the Office of Works, and as advised by them the Committee wore of opinion that an adequate memorial could be erected at Ypres at a cost of 150,000/., and the Committee recommend that this amount should be spent on a general Imperial memorial at Ypres. For other battlefields the Committee suggest that a total of not exceeding 150,000/. should be spent; they are bound to point out that this figure is somewhat tentative, but it balances tho 150,000/. which they recommend for Ypres.11. As the Committee could not proceed to decide upon the actual numbers and sites of memorials without knowing if His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to find the necessary money, reference was made to the Cabinet who decided in August last that: (a.) (i.) It is desirable to erect an Imperial memorial at Ypres, in the form of a gateway, at the Menin Gate, at a cost not exceeding 150,000/., and that the Dominions should be given an opportunity of associating themselves with the scheme should they so wish.(ii.) Suitable memorials, such as a cross, an obelisk, a cenotaph or a sea mark, should be erected, at a total cost not exceeding 150,000/., by the United Kingdom on the most memorable battlefields in France, and at Gallipdli and Salonika; the questions of Palestine, Mesopotamia and East Africa being reserved for further consideration, if necessary.(b.) That the Secretary of State for India should be authorized to invite a contribution from the Government of India towards the Imperial memorial at Ypres.Inference t0 12. The Governments of India and of the Dominions have now been asked whether they desire to India and associate themselves in the &quot; Menin Gate &quot; scheme, which the representatives of&apos; the Dominions here have assured us is likely to be favourably considered, but their replies have not yet been received. The Committee have suggested that, should they so desire, the Dominions and India might see their way to contributing one-third of the cost of the Menin Gate scheme (50,000/.), the remainder falling on the British Exchequer. This would release 50,000/., which could, if required, be added to the 150,000/. suggested for memorials elsewhere and still leave the total to be spent by the United Kingdom unchanged at 300,000/.Authority for expendi-ture ob-tained from the Cabinet.otherDominions.Problems consequent on the Gov-ernment decision.13. Having obtained the agreement of the Cabinet in principle to the expenditure of not exceeding 300,000/. the Committee appointed a sub-committee to go into details as regards (i.) Sites of memorials, (ii.) Number of memorials, (iii.) Form of memorials, (iv.) Selection of designs.14. (i.) Sites. Before entering upon this question of sites the Chairman addressed letters to Viscount French, Earl Haig, Lord Rawlinson, Lord Horne and Lord Byng asking for their or^ii^arv11 recommendations as to the most suitable battlefields to be commemorated, while in order to judge between the sites so recommended, bearing in mind the views &quot;that artistic opinion and accessibility to the public must be weighed, it was found necessary that a sub-committee should visit the sites in company with experts.15. The Sub-Committee accordingly, with the exception of Sir Aston Webb, who was unable to leave England, spent four days from 5 th November to 9th, November in the most careful examination of the principal battlefields. *&apos; Owing to the absence of Sir Aston Webb, the Sub-Committee invited Mr. J. W. Simpson, President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, to take part in the visit as technical adviser, and they had the further advantage of the advice of Mr. R. J. Allison, Principal Architect of His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works, who also attended at the request of the First Commissioner, as the. latter is likely to be the Minister charged with the actual work of erecting any National Memorials.Sites.Consu&apos; of Military Com-manders.Visit to sites.Ypres.The task -of the Sub-Committee divided itself into two parts : (i.) To explore the possibilities of the Menin Gate at Ypres as a memorial to. the fighting in Belgium upon which the Cabinet have already in principle agreed to spend a sum not exceeding 150,000/. &apos;(ii.) To report as to what memorials should be erected in France.
I-Yprbs.16. The Sub-Committee made a most carefal examination of the gateway and were impressed with the artistic possibilities of the situation as well as by its military significance for the Divisions of the British Army. They were of opinion that a gateway or archway at the Menin G-ate would be the most appropriate memorial. It was pointed out to the Committee that the town of Ypres is 0^iection to growing up on both sides of the ramparts, and the history of towns shows that owing to their growth and the exigencies of traffic, gateways are generally removed (like Temple Bar) or the traffic is diverted round them (like the Marble Arch); that the track of a tramway runs through the gateway already, and that the ramparts on either side of the Menin Gate may, at some future time, be removed and the moat filled in.But having considered these objections, the Sub-Committee remain of opinion that an archway or gateway is the most significant form which the memorial contemplated could take.  The Committee Advantages recommend that in drawing up the conditions for the architectural competition, a chief point should 0f an arch-be that any design must include a striking and easily legible inscription ; with this proviso the way and treatment of the Menin Gate should be left to the competing architects, the scheme of an archway necessity or gateway being placed before them as a first of possible alternatives. , scription&quot;17. In view of the rapid reconstruction now taking place in Ypres, the Belgian Government has been asked without delay to re-affirm the agreement made with the Battle Exploit Memorials Committee in July, 1919, at Ypres, by which the Belgian authorities undertook to leave the ramparts in their ruined state pending the formulation of a scheme of memorial reconstruction by the British Government. (Probably not more than 100 metres of the ramparts on either side of the Gate would be required for the memorial). This opinion was conveyed, unofficially, to the British Military Attache who met the Sub-Committee at Ypres.II. France.18. The case of France is much more difficult than that of Belgium.    Small memorials are France, being erected on the various battlefields by individual units; larger memorials are contemplated by Difficulty of the Dominions, and it is understood that the Americans propose to put up memorials on a consider- electing able scale.  It is clear, therefore, that any National Memorial erected to commemorate the actions 81 es&apos; of the British Armies in France must be adequate to the dignity of the Empire.19. The Committee, after careful consideration, are convinced that the character of any memorial in France must be such as to commemorate (i.) Victory over the enemy. Principles oftvi c !    n i selection.(11.) Phases of the fighting.There are considerations winch would lead to the choice of the Marne as a suitable site for a memorial. It was there that the Germans suffered their first and, perhaps, decisive defeat. The number of British troops engaged, though they represented the flower of the old Army, was small compared with the troops that fought on the Somme or the Hindenburg Line. To some extent the Somme stands for France, much as Ypres stands for Belgium in the eyes of the British soldier, and it would, therefore, seem impossible not to include the Somme in any scheme for commemorating the fighting in France.There are, moreover, the Arras region and Vimy Ridge. In these areas the site would obviously be the summit of Vimy Ridge, but arrangements are being made by the Canadian Government to erect a Battle Memorial there.Finally, the successful arrest of the German attack in 1918, and the British victories later in the year point to the erection of a memorial at Villers-Bretonneux or-on the Hindenburg Line.From a military point of view, probably the best monument to a battle is at the culminating point of the battle itself; but the most famous battlefields (e.g., The Hindenburg Line and the Somme) are remote from the ordinary routes of travellers; and a memorial which can only be reached by a long motor car journey will rarely be visited by the ordinary man, and if it is seen only by very few French peasants, it will fail to commemorate the sentiment of alliance of which such memorials should be perpetual reminder.An alternative would be to place some striking monument in a large town which could be viewed by thousands of passers by every day ; but the only town which would be really central for such a memorial is Paris itself, which was not a battlefield.20. The Committee were thus forced to the conclusion that a single monument in France would More than be inadequate and that to fulfil the double function of commemorating the victory and the battles JXl^iraMe that made the victory possible, more than one memorial is desirable.21. After earnest consideration it appeared that the best method of arriving at the number Phases of tho. .of memorials would be to divide the war into its various broad phases and to commemorate these.      war&quot; These phases may be roughly grouped under the following four heads: (i.) The actions of 1914, beginning with the retreat from Mons and ending with the battle of the Aisne.(ii.) The fighting at Ypres (continuous throughout the war), (hi.) The immense sacrifices of 1916 and 1917 on the Somme and about Arras, (iv.) The retreat and advance of 1918.
Views of the Military Com-manders.22. The recommendations of the military commanders referred to in paragraph 14, were as follows: 	1914.	1914-15.	1910-17.	1918.F.-M. Lord French	La Ferto-sous-Jouarre -(on the Marne),	...	-...	* * *F.-M. Lord Haig......	Troyon.	Ypres.	Pozieres. Monehy-le-Preux. Thiopval.	Troyon. Villers-Bretonneux. Bony. Bellicourt.General Lord Rawlinson...	...	Polygon Wood.	Pozieres.	Epohy.General Lord Home	Messines. Givenchy.	...	Messines. Albert. Butte de Warlencourt. Point du Jour. Viniy.	Messines. Givenchy.The Sub-Committee visited practically all these sites and, assuming that the memorials are to be erected on the actual battlefields, had no difficulty in selecting the most suitable sites for the first and last phases of the war.(i.) The Fighting and Victory of the Marne, 1914.First phase. 23. The Sub-Committee unanimously concurred in the recommendation of Lord French that the early operations of 1914 could best be commemorated at La Ferte-sous-Jouarre at the point where the 3rd Corps crossed the River Marne, giving invaluable assistance to General Maunoury in his operations on the enemy&apos;s flank at the crossing of the Ourcq. There is an admirable site on the hills above the town, south of the Marne, but the Sub-Committee felt that some memorial in the vicinity of the bridge, or on the bridge itself, which is also famous for the Crossing of the Marne by Napoleon in 1814 exactly 100 years before is the best means of commemorating the turning point of the war. It may be&apos; observed that the town has already renamed the boulevards along the river &quot; Boulevards des Anglais.&quot;(ii.) The Last Phase, 1918.Last phase. 24. The Sub-Committee were unanimous in the choice of Villers-Bretonneux as the most suitable spot to commemorate the actions of 1918. It was here that the 4th Army under General Rawlinson checked the German advance in April, 1918, within 8 miles of Amiens and subsequently drove them out on 8th August, 1918, a day specially marked by Ludendorff in the German Military Calendar. There is an admirable site in the centre of the town at the junction of the Corbie  Villers-Bretonneux and Villers-Bretonneux Amiens road.These two sites (La Ferte-sous-Jouarre and Villers-Bretonneux) are also the choice of the two Commanders-in-Chief concerned, and are comparatively easy of access, the one from Paris, and the other from Amiens.(iii.) The Intermediate Phase.25. The problem of commemorating the stupendous battles on the Somme and in the neighbourhood of Arras presents great difficulties, there being no central spot connected with both, though the Sub-Committee carefully considered the Vimy Eidge, Albert, Pozieres and the Butte de &quot;Warlencourt.28. The Committee consequently recommend that to commemorate the wiiole of the fighting in France subsequent to the battle of the i\larne there shotild he erected a monument at Amiens, as the most central point for the whole fighting, and that to commemorate the fighting on the Marne in 1914 a memorial should be erected at La Ferte-sous-Jouarre. They were also disposed to accept the recommendation of Viliers-Bretonneux, but they were informed that the Australian G-overnment ropose to spend as much as  100,000 on a memorial there27. The Sub-Committee also felt that commemorative tablets might   well be erected in some of the cathedrals with which the British Army were connected, such as Amiens, Arras, Beauvais, Boulogne, Cambrai, Laon, Lille, Meaux, Noyon, Paris (Notre Dame), Rheims, Rouen, St. Omer,, St. Quentin, Soissons.This recommendation the Committee endorse.28. There remains for consideration the question of Gallipoli and the theatres of war other than Flanders and France.With regard to Mesopotamia, the Committee are informed that arrangements have been made locally for the erection of a memorial to the troops that fought with Sir Stanley Maude. In the case of Palestine, Lord Allenby has prepared a scheme for the erection, near Jerusalem, of a memorial, for which 11,000/. has been subscribed. At Salonica, the troops under the command of General Milne have subscribed some 5,000/., and arrangements are being made locally for the erection of a memorial near Salonica.Indian ^ne Indian troops are closely identified with the first two theatres, and in view of what hastroops. already been done and the necessity for ascertaining more precisely the intentions of the Indian Government, the Committee have not delayed their report till the problems of Mesopotamia, Palestine and Salonica are cleared up. The Committee desire to be instructed whether the Government contemplate erecting memorials in Salonica, Palestine and Mesopotamia in addition to those already provided for.Inter-mediate phase.Selection by Committee.Amiens. The Marne.Tablets in Cathedrals.Other theatres.Mesopo-tamia.Palestine.Salonica.
29. As regards Gallipoli, a Committee of representatives of the three services has been Gallipoli. investigating the possibility of erecting a joint memorial to all British troops that fought there (other than troops from the Dominions, &amp;c).General Hunter-Weston, who is a member of this Committee, gave evidence before the Committee, and explained that an investigation of sites is now being carried out as to the actual sites. The Australian and New Zealand Governments already contemplated erecting memorials at Anzac, and with this proposal the Committee would not, of course, interfere,General Hunter-Weston is proceeding shortly to Gallipoli, and the Committee gladly availed themselves of his offer to report in particular and detail upon the possibility of Kourgi-Baba and other sites in the neighbourhood.30. The Committee would accordingly prefer not to make definite recommendations regarding Gallipoli until they had received General Hunter-Weston&apos;s report.31.   As regards the selection of artists and designs for the memorial, the Committee recommend Design, that the designs for all the sites should be thrown open to competition, and that competitors, in the first instance, should submit sketches.   A suitable assessor or assessors should be selected, who should choose the best six sketches; the designers of these sketches should receive 200 guineas, and then proceed to a further competition, in which finished designs should be asked for.   The actual terms under which the public competition should be held should be drawn by proper architectural Open authorities, such as the President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, in conjunction with the competition, authorities of His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works, who would probably be charged with the duties of supervising the expenditure in connection with the erection of the memorials.   The Committee would j^^S^ not be bound to accept any design, and the final freedom of the Cabinet to select is, of course, to be aml Cabinet understood.   The consent of the Belgian and French Governments to the designs selected should be to select or obtained diplomatically. reject.32. As regards the machinery for the execution of the design, the Committee recommend Admimatra-that when the actual sum of money and the designs have been decided upon, His Majesty&apos;s Office of tive Works should enter into the necessary contracts for tho proper execution of the work and should machinery, supervise and account for authorized expenditure.33. The Committee are informed by the Admiralty representative that the Admiralty contemplate the erection of some general memorial to the Navy. Such a scheme has obviously much to commend it but the Committee consider that it should be left for separate consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government.34. The recommendations of the Committee may be summarized as follows:- Summary,d.) That, as outlined in paragraph 16, the Menin Gate at Ypres be adopted as the memorial in Flanders at a cost not exceeding  150,000-to which contributions of,say,  50,000 in all will be invited from India and the Dominions, (ii.) That a central memorial in France be erected at Amiens, and a memorial be alsoerected at La Ferte-sous-Jouarre. (iii.) That tablets be phced in some of the Cathedrals in the area in which British troopsoperated, and possibly a somewhat more conspicuous memorial in the Cathedral atArras.(iv.) That open competition he adopted in all cases, and that the terms of competition should be drawn up by an assessor or assessors in consultation with the Office of Works and submitted to the Committee, and that the Treasury should arrange for the preliminary expenses, (v.) That the Office of Works be instructed to prepare the necessary surveys of the sites at the Menin Gate and at La Fert6-sous-Jouarre, and ascertair what site is available at Amiens.(vi.) That an announcement to Parliament should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government.35.
