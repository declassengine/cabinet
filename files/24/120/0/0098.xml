However, such steps could not, without a special authorisation be taken unless it was certain that the Court would actually be constituted*    But this presupposes, according to the Resolution of the Assembly taken on  Becenber 13th. last, that the Court Statute is ratified by a majority of the members of the League, that Is to say, by at least twenty-four Governments.,Only one having up to this date ratified the Statute and the matter being for the above reasons of V irery urgent nature, it is suggested.-that the Council authorise the Secretary-General to send out a pressing appeal to those Members of the League who have already signed the protocol of Signature to ratify the Statute, and to those who have not signed to do so and
deposit their ratifications:that the Cuiiacxl authorise the Secretary-General to tr.ke steps, if necessary, on or after April 1st, for citato rg a cord? v.?.oral nomination of candidates , if the Court Statute has not been ratified by twenty-four Members of the League at that date.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, &quot; March 11, 1921.
