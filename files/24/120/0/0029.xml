(P 1053)        From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,&apos; 23rd February 1921.Clear the line.1172. Your telegram dated the 21st February, 229 S. Afghanistan. Clauses of Dobbs&apos; draft taken separately are no doubt all covered more or less clearly by previous authority, but first feeling produced by comprehensive restatement of position thus supplied is nevertheless one that we have already gone very far indeed in the way of concessions to Afghans, without securing anything at ail comparable in return. It is to be noted that clauses 2, 3 and 13 all embody concessions which it had been contemplated would only be given as parts of thoroughly satisfactory general settlement. In particular, it was contemplated that Torklian, would be used for bargaining purposes and only given as a final concession see my telegram dated the 19th December. I do not gather precisely what procedure Dobbs proposes to follow in putting his draft to Afghans, and of course full discretion must be hit to him, but if intention is to put whole draft before them at once should it not contain some material for bargaining? Again, I feel that it should be possible to secure something more in the way of return for our expenditure than Dobbs&apos; draft promises. I do not overlook your telegram 1502 of 31st December, but would again suggest &apos;that possibility should be considered of adding some such provision as that it will be open to the Government of India to oiler the Afghan Government, and for the Afghan Government to ask of the Government of India, friendly advice in regard to the foreign relations of Afghanistan.Furthermore, in view of reference to subject in your telegram, I must repeat, to avoid possibility of misunderstanding, that whole position must continue to be governed by Afghan-Bolshevik proceedings. We can sign no treaty with Afghans unless and until we are satisfied that there is nothing in Bolshevik treaty directed against our interests. If, therefore, Afghans ratify Bolshevik treaty without commu-nicating it to us, and if it proves to contain clauses hostile to us, negotiations will lapse, and Dobbs must choose moment at which to inform Afghans of this. We cannot, in my opinion, be satisfied, in the circumstances, with security given by clauses 14 and 15 of Dobbs&apos;draft. In particular it should be understood that any treaty which provides for payment of a subsidy to the Afghans by the Bolsheviks must, ipso facto, be held objectionable. (See para. 1 of my telegram No. 2921 of 29th October last.) It is a question for consideration whether a strong stand might not also be made against supply of aeroplanes and arms to Afghans by.Bolsheviks outside their treaty.Subject to these remarks, and to following -emeries on points of detail, I agree that Dobbs may be authorised to negotiate on the basis of his draft as a maximum in. the way of concessions, and that lie may similarly be given discretion to increase subsidy up to 20k lakhs, and to make it date from conclusion of Rawalpindi treaty.As regards details of Dobbs&apos; draft I wish to offer following remarks : &apos;Clause 5 and Schedule. I have not seen Afghan Appendix I. (6), but assume it is unobjectionable.Clause (J I am not clear whether reference is to towns or districts. I presume it will be made clear that prohibition of other foreign Consuls in Afghanistan covers whole Eastern frontier zone. Would it not be better to specify a zone limited by a line parallel to frontier? As regards British territory, I-understand meaning to be-that foreign Consuls are not to be allowed between Indus and Afghan frontier.ClauseS. I assume intention is merely to give full rebate of Customs duty on Afghan Government stores and not to exempt them from Customs supervision.Clause 14. I presume para, .3 of aide-memoire will be reproduced as a definite undertaking by the Afghan Government and not a mere statement of British, expectations.. In communicating my views to Dobbs, please express my confidence in him, and my appreciation of skill with which he is handling Very difficult situation.
