/    /     /    Jh This Document is the Property of 1 / ^r * &quot;&apos;3 Government.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India^SECRET:INDIAN MILITARY EXPENDITURE./v\\.P   2673Memorandum by Seouetauy of State pob India.I am not sure that any very useful purpose is served by a paper duel on this subject, but I feel obliged to reply to the criticisms made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (formerly for War) in his memorandum of 10th -February (CP, 2504),(1) Mr. Churchill objects to the figures of the League of Nations Secretariat as being misleading for the purpose of comparing the proportion of military to total expenditure in India and other countries, on the ground that they include the health and unemployment insurance of the United Kingdom, which have no counterpart in India, and the service of debt. My object was to show the relative pressure of military expenditure on the peoples concerned. It is, of course, true that expenditure on social services in India is at present on a very small scale. But this of itself testifies to the weight of military expenditure, which leaves India with a balance of only 65,000,000/. for all other purposes, including social services, as compared with a British balance of I,135,000,QOO .The omission of debt service docs not greatly affect the position. It raises the proportion of military to total expenditure in the United Kingdom from 16*8 per cent, to 22&apos;G percent. ; but it also raises the proportion in India from 35&quot; 7 per cent, to 38 per cent. I am quite content to base the Indian case on the disparity between 22*0 per cent, and 38 per cent.(2) Mr. Churchill appears to prefer a comparison based on the charge for defence per head of population, and points out that whereas in India it is 2s., in the United Kingdom it is hi. I am willing to accept that basis, if the average income, as well as the average military expenditure, and the relevant economic considerations, are taken into account.   Thus : United Kingdom. A. Average income per head per annum, 1121. 10s.B. Average payment for defence, hi.Percentage of B on A, 4&apos;4 per cent.India. A. Average income per head per annum, probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of, Rs. 00. B. Average payment for defence, Rs. 2^.Percentage of B on A, 3*9 per cent.To get at the taxable capacity of a country it is necessary to deduct from the gross income that minimum sum which is necessary to keep the population alive and able to continue working with its normal efficiency. It is only when the balance is known that the relative proportion of expenditure on a particular purpose can be properly compared. Looked at from &quot;this point of view, the margin in the Indians income of Rs. 57S- is infinitelv less than that in the 107Z. 10s. of the inhabitant of the United Kingdom.(3) As regards capitation rate, I did not mean to suggest that India should not pay the market value of what she receives. What I meant was that even if it can be shown that the market value is in excess of the rate which she at. present pays, India can pay no more than she is paying now. She has already shown herself willing to adopt the alternative, viz., to employ fewer British troops, and it only remains to decide whether this is compatible with safety.Although it is not strictly relevant to the present discussion at the present stage, I may perhaps remind my colleagues of a fact which is sometimes forgotten by other Departments, viz., that the expenditure of the revenues of India is, by the Government of India Act (section 21), subject to the control, not of Parliament, but of the Secretary of State for India in Council, and no grant or appropriation of any part of those revenues may be made without the concurrence of a majority of votes at a meeting of the Council of India.E.
