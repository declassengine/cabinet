Bromley has risked his reputation and he dare not appear to surrender.   It is doubtful whether half his men will obey the strike order and support from the National Union of Railwayman will be negligible.   A resolution in favour of a strike at the important branch of the Associated Society of Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen at Crewe was negatived by 74 votes against 4.   Unemployment has had a sobering effect upon the railwaymen generally.Unemployment is still the most important question of the moment. It may be* complicated by drastio action on the part of the miners. The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is making mischief with a story that the mine owners are making arrangements for a general lock-out.   On the other hand, the decision to extend the period of benefits under Unemploy-ment Insurance has had a very good effect.Special attention is drawn to the extracts from the balance sheet of the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain, which are given in this Report.I am able this week to give important information regarding the &quot;Red International&quot; of Trade Unions&quot;, which is a well-organised and ,v growing movement. It must inevitably clash with the Amsterdam % International before long.There were outbreaks of arson in the London and Manchester districts.  Probably they are in pursuance of a plan made by John McGrath to oarry out outrage in England and so impress public opinionWhile there has been a slight diminution of Sinn Fein outrage in Ireland during the week, two bad oases of ambushing trains are reported.
^employment the announcement in the Eing&apos;s Speech that the period of unemployment benefit will be extended will do much to allay the anxiety of the unemployed.The London District Council of Unemployed organisations is anxious to affiliate as many of the Surburban Unemployed Committoes as possible to its rants, and with this object in view the speakers from the London body are urging the men to lose no time in joining headquarters.    It is noticeable that the unemployed committees on the outskirts of the Metropolis are not so eager to link up with the London District Council as are their comrades of the inner boroughs, but the&quot;speakers are urging that it is only by unity that the emancipation of the workors can be accomplished, XThe Bermon&amp;sey and Hotherhithe Organize! Unemployed are occupying the 1-ublio Baths in Spa Ho ad, S.E., which they use as their headquarters.    On the front of the building they hare placed a board, on which appears, &quot;Destitution Domicile^&apos; -&quot;Buckingham Palace&quot; - &quot;Motto, Work or Maintenance.&quot;    Pressure has been put on the Mayor of Bermondsey, Alderman Bustin, to use his influence to obtain the removal of this board, as members of the Borough Council objected to it3 use, but up to the present this protest has apparently had no effect.In addition to their quarters at the Baths, the organization has been granted the use of the Town Hall, Spa Eoad, 8..&quot;3., for two evenings a week.    They are not; however, satisfied with this but are demanding a third night weekly.The Bermondsey Official Belief Fund has now been exhaustec, and relief ha3 been suspended for the time being, which has caused dissatisfaction among the organised men.    The leaders of the Bermondsey and Kotherhithe Organised Unemployed are falling out among themselves,&apos; and there are disputes over money matters.From Camberwell ifc is reported that the unemployed marches
i; 1are to continue, but on a date to be decided upon, a procession will be formed consisting of the unemployed from Lambeth, Bermondsey, Southward and Camberwell,    They hope to muster 2,000 men and will start off as if for a march, but on reaching Rorleys, General Provision Stores, Peckham Koad, Camberwell, about mid-day, they intend to 3warra tho shop and seize the goods.    Certain men are to be chosen to be in the shop to make*purchases, but on the approach of tho procession they aro to disconnect the telephone.    Kay and Fanning are the ringleaders.Jones, secretary of the Kensington unemployed committoe, has resigned owing to the dishonesty of the treasurer and the chairman.    He alleges that there was a discrepancy of  5 in one week and intends to start another organisation of his own, hoping, no doubt, to obtain thereby greater benefit for himselfThe London District Council of the Unemployed Organisation intends to hold a demonstration in Trafalgar Square on February 19th.In Lancashire and Cheshire the unemployment figures have increased from 421,977 to 438,136:   depression in the cotton trade is acute and the operatives are losing hope.    In Manchester, meals are being given daily to hundreds of men, women and children, who would otherwise be faced with starvation A week ago the crowd clamouring for meals at Chorlton-on-MedlooS was so great that a portion of the wall of the Ivy Club was demolished.    Detailed reports from Blackburn, Darwen, Nelson, Burnley, loch&amp;ale, Preston, and Oldham reveal distressing conditions.Unemployment is still increasing in Yorkshire, but there are, as yet, no signs of disorder.The Leicester Unemployed have brought out a four page Bulletin, but the first two issues have resulted in financial loss and the paper will probably not-have a long life.    Minto,the/T S
the secretary of the unemployed committee, has announced his intention of bringing 25 ex-Service men to London to see the Prime Minister,Unemployment appears to be increasing in the South Wales coalfield;   in the Afan Valley district for instance* 4,000 miners are unemployed, 3,000 on half time and the remaining 2,000 on full time.    George Barker of the South Wales Miners&apos; federation, declared at Llanhilleth on February 13th that the miners were not going to allow their men to be starved in4batches and threatened a strike of the whole industry.In Glasgow the number of unemployed is reported to have reached 33,000.    There was some disturbance at John Maclean1s meeting on February 10th owing to an order that all interrupters &quot;drunk or sober&quot; were to be thrown out of the hall. About a dozen men were thereupon forcibly ejected.JBK3AT2IIED Sl^irfi OP THE associated society m LOCOMOTIVE gglgMS Am .... . 1There is little enthusiasm among the locomotive men for a.strike, and the national Union of Railwaymen do not support it.   It is doubtful if more than half the drivers will come out.   One of my informants says that the date fixed for&apos;the strike is February 20th and that it would be unwise to believe that Bromley1a threat is only bluff.   The membership of the Society in September, 1S20, was 70,000 and the funds last &quot;.. May amounted to  205,500.Enquiries in London -show that the men were amazed at the threat of a strike.   All agree that an ^enquiry should be held but none think a strike necessary to secure this end.   The &quot; older men are indignant and say that the Union will be injured. They think the strike would be ineffective and that the rivalry between the two Unions has been accentuated.   Foot, the extremist, of the National Union of R&amp;ilwaymen, has warned the branches toget/
get their Strike Committees together.In Yorkshire the Jftiginemen are said to he solid and the support of a small number of National Union men is possible.In the Midlands it is thought that a majority will obey the strike order, though other railwayman are not in sympathy.In Lancashire even the drivers are said to be &quot;hopelessly divided&quot; and a majority of the National Union of Railwaymen is opposed to a strike.   In Liverpool it is believed that the strike would be of a &quot;lightning&quot; character.The threat is unpopular in South Wales.In Glasgow ?nd West Scotland a majority of the drivers is reported to be opposed to a strike, but 50 per cent might temporarily obey a strike order.   The majority of railwsymen in this district are Scotsmen, who care very little about the Irish question.RED INTERNATIONA 0? TRADE UNIONSAn important secret document diccloses the fact that a meeting of the British Bureau of this movement was held in London on January 31st;   there were present, Robert Williams, J.T. Murphy, Gorge Poet, E. Liamer, Page Arnott, E. Burns, A.V.,.Williams, Mrs.. Briber, Ellen Wilkinson, R. Holder, A.. Booth and Mary Moorhouse.Murphy outlined the plans of the Moscow Provisional Executive for &quot;conducting propaganda inside the trade union movement.&quot;   It was moved b:;- Robert Williams and seconded by A.V. Williams (President, Yorkshire Miners1 Unofficial Reform Co.mmitt.ee) and agreed &quot;That wo constitute ,ourselves the British Bureau of the Provisional International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions with powers to co-opt other members we may mutually agree-to.&quot;  Robert Williams consented to draft a general, manifesto on behalf of the Bureau and Mrs...briber and Ellen Wilkinson agreed to draft one forwomen/
ax    )   **31women trade unionists.   It wag arranged that the names of members of the Bureau be appended to published.matter and that their organisations also be designated&apos; &quot;/unless otherwise requested.&quot;Robert Williams, J.T. Murphy and Ellen Wilkinson were deputed to confer with the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain with reference to propaganda.   It was decided to offer Tom Mann the post :o.f-national organiser. The next meeting of the Bureau was -fixed for February 23rd.Although the organisation is working largely underground in Great Britain, Moscow is making active preparations for a public campaign.   Zinovieff has addressed to Jouhaux, Fimmen and Gu&amp;egeeet, and the 3ritish Bureau has sent to J.H., Thomas and Arthur, Henderson, a letter in which it is suggested that public discussions on the merits of the Amsterdam and Bed Internationals be held forthwith in London, Paris, Amsterdam and other European capitals.  ,Zinovieff challenges representatives of the Amsterdam International to participate in these debates and proposes that they should, by their &quot;considerable influence in the ministerial circles of,&apos;&quot;   &quot;&quot; &apos; &quot;&quot;   &apos;*&apos; fc&quot;    *&apos; -**the bourgeois Governments&quot; make it possible for representativesof the Red International to be admitted into the various countries in which the issue is to be laid before the workers.The concluding passages of this insolent; letter, which the&quot;Daily Herald&quot; has naturally omitted, in addition toforgetting to mention other unpleasant sentences, bearquotation: -    r ,.:    &quot;Please examine.our proposal as soon as you can among your own circle - that is to say the circle of ,bureaucrats of the Amgter-Iam International and the Home ancl Foreign Ministers of your Governments and let us have a reply one way, 01: &quot;the - other .as soon as, possible. We eagerly await your&apos;reply *   You can be sure, .Gentlemen, thatwe quits understand the,difficulty of , your position.  Accept our condoXences  or the rapid &apos; disintegration of your, forcest with the.whole world looking on, and accept our assurance that the advance guard of the workers of the worl.cl knovya you at your&apos;.&apos;&quot;&apos; true/
true worth., and,that It knows also that in order to overthrow the power of capitalism, it is also neoeasaa to put an end to the treaeberou3&apos;&quot;rGAnison oall the ima^erdam.In^ernairicm^  of Trade Unions.* i *Yours very respectfully,Petrograd, Jany. 12.21.&quot;The Red International movement in this country ia bettj organised than any British revolutionary campaign since November 1917,   It is true that the adherents number, as ye) only a small percentage; of organised labour, but the important fact is that they are,&apos; almost without exoeption, trade unionists, and it must be remembered that ths movemenj ie based on the knowledge that trade unionism is an , insuperable barrier to communism, and is therefore potentia as dangerous as the bickering communist groups are^ne^ligitExamination of absolutely reliable information shows that the Amalgamated Engineering Union has accepted the, Bedl International more readily and more extensively than other unions.   The South Wales coalfield is also being thoroughly worked.  A.J.r Cook, v/ho is now on the executive of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, is directing operations and secretaries or agents have already organised centres at Caerphilly, Chepstow, Garnent, Glyraeath, Heath and Newport:Harry Pollitt is organiser for the London,district, a a weekly salary of  6, and fcuas &quot;roped in&quot; as assistants, among others, J.J. Vaughan. R. Williams and Sam Elsbury. P&amp;llitt appears to be working efficiently and on good line i centres have been started at Chingford, Cray ford, Bast Hso, Edmonton, Forest Gate, Poplar, Streatham and Tooting and have in some cases already passed the resolutions.W. Brain, the Birmingham communist, has been appoint^ Midlands organises and will be responsible for the B1 mingham,,- Coventry, Derby, Leicester, Nottingham, Kugby,p.. Sheffield/
Sheffield and. Wolverhampton districts,Tom Din^ley, another organiser who receives a weeklysalary of  5, has just toured the Yorkshire coalfield, hutowing to inadequate local arrangements, most of his meetings*fell through.George Harvey is organising the Worth Eastern area, more particularly in conjunction with the miners1 unofficial teform movement in the Northumberland and Durham coalfields.The resolutions have been passed by trade union branches or centres and are being or have been formed in the following places:   Barrow, Bournemouth, Caimscross, nr. Stroud, Clifton, nr. Brighouse, Devonport, Doricaster, High Vfycombe, Hurlford, Leeds, Letchworth, Ketherton, Newcastle, Nottingham, Pelaw-on-Tyne, Portsmouth, RotherhamtSalford, Sheffield, Southampton, Stratford.   , *In Scotland also progress has been made.  William Leonard is at present organising the Glasgow district, and progress has been made at Bridgeton, burnt island,&apos; Dysart, Edinburgh, Gourock, Greenock. Hamilton,Kilmamock, Kinghora, Kirkcaldy, Motherwell, Musselburgh, Ormiston, Pencaitland, Prestonpans, Hosyth and Sinclairtown.   The resolutions have been passed by miners1 lodges at Buckhaven, Dunbeath, Dunnikier, Gorlaston, Kirkland, Thornton, Wadyford Pit and Wallsgreen by the Thornton branch of the National Union of Railwaymen and by the Edinburgh branch of the National Union of foundry Workers.W, Gallacher, who is one of the leaders of the movement, receives a weekly salary;   he is also national organiser of the Shop Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committees.As far as is known, only one branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers&apos; Union has passed the resolution.It seems likely that the steadier trade union branches are ignoring the circular, or that their officials arenot/
not presenting it for consideration.   Bolton branch of the Lancashire Amalgamated  Tc.pe Slzers Protective Society has informed Poet that it has imanimously decided to &quot;decline any suggestion of joining hands with your section.&quot;Tig 00HKUNI3T8Though there is great activity in propaganda in London, the Communist speakers are seriously considering the risk of preaching sedition.   The arrest of Callaoher for the speech mentioned in my Report No. 91 has caused them graw concern. Some of them are now adopting Russian nicknames.   Arthur McManug is called &quot;Little Lenin^&apos; and Bert Joy &quot;Tooting Trotsky.&quot;   The boycott of &quot;The Communist&quot; by wholesale firms has greatly perturbed, the Party.  Members are now being urged&apos; to distribute back numbers gratis outside the Labour Exchanges.   It is significant;-that&apos; at Rochdale the Trades and Labour Council has refused, by 182 to 60 votes, the aiTiliation of the local Communist Party.   In Coventry orders were received from headquarters that members in future were to be known by numbers and not by names, and that ail records are to be concealed.in case of a Police raid.   H.M. Emery, the notorious agitaltor, has &apos;been elected Chairman of thi3 branch.   Le.rge Conimilnist meetings have been held at Leeds and lull.during the week;   William Paul, who returned from Russia with lantern slides, had an audience of about 2,500 at Birmingham on the 13th.   In the present state of the law it is not illegal, to import Russian propagandist material for stirring up sedition.   Unless some legislation is provided the evil will grow.The Communists evidently believe in hitting a man hard when he is down.   In addition to a private boycott\ ;3; 11 111 mm IliP    &apos;m f^F^WM
of the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; the -Communist Party of Great Britain is spreading the report that Sylvia Pcninurst was responsible for the arrest of Veltheim and sajathat a definite charge is to be made against her when she has finished her term of imprisonment.   In point of fact, she is one of the very few British revolutionaries   who really believe the doctrine which they preach,&quot;Unity&quot; is farther than ever removed from the Glasgow Communists.   The Conimunist Party of Great Britain is the object of violent attacks and it is openly stated that Francis Meynell took with him to &quot;The Communist&quot; thtr greater part of the  75,000, which is being used to push the paper and to provide MaoManus and other leaders with motor cars.THff MINERSffEDSBATIOfl OF GREAT BRITAINUnder the heading &quot;Move to Bock-out Miners - Secret Plans to cut at Wages&quot;,.the &quot;Baily Herald&quot; of February 16th printed a most mischievous article in which it was stated that &quot;a national lock-out of miners ha3 been decided on by the mine owners of Great Britain in order to force a reduction of wages&quot; and that &quot;the information comes from &apos;  a reliable source&quot; and confirms the warning which the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has published that a first-class mining crisis was approaching, ; This article is supplemented by an interview with&apos;Frank Hodges entitled &quot;Governmental Law Breaking&quot;, in which he alleges that &quot;the Government seems to be acting in opposition to. and in contreivention of the.5!!-. - &quot; .Coal Mines Emergency Act in connection with the closing down of collieries&quot;.   He adds that the owners1 attack upon the miners&apos; wages &quot;has.the appearance of being supported by the Government..*The Miners&apos; federation will not tolerate this form of attack.*.These slim dodges simply won&apos;t do and if they are persisted in the whole of the present negotiations are prejudiced and will undoubtedly have to be broken off.&quot;James/
James Winstone, President of the South Wales Miners1 Federation, has also ;seen fit to state publicly that if the terms offered by the owners are as i^umoured, the miners &quot;would soon be fighting with their backs to the wall.&quot;The following is the text of the questionnaire regard!:a new standard wage, Issued to lodges by the Miners1 Federaof Great Britain:(l) &quot;Shall the consolidation of wages be effected by incorporating part of the flat rates and district percentages into a new 1921 standard with a uniform/-&apos; percentage throughout the country, or by incorporating district percentages into a new 1921 standard with the Sankey&apos; award and war wage as a new combined flat rate addition thereto?(&apos;2)   &quot;Shall the regulation of future wages be by (a) percentago advances or reductions; (b) flat rate advaa or reductions?(3) &quot;Shall the war time payment for time lost through circumstances over which the workmen have no control I continued, ear &amp;t present and not merged, or shall the value thereof be added.to the new standard as proposed in (a) or added to the new combined flat rate above th standard as in (b).(4)   &quot;Bo you accept the principle of the minimum profi for the owners of.capital being a definite relation to ... a.minimum of wages for ,the workmen, the amounts in hot cases to be hereafter determined?(5) &quot;Shall the profits of the industry, after tbe tot costs-have, been met (included therein standard wages a minimum in profits costs)&apos; be disposable in proportion to be hereafter agreed upon, and to operate automatics during the lifetime of the proposed agreement.&quot;The local lodge secretaries are to send in the members decisions by February 22nd.   The miners, as a whole, do not appear to have grasped the meaning of this questionnaire, at present favour a high flat rate.One of my correspondents has secured a copy of the official balance sheet of the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain for the year ending June 30th, 1920, which is of especial interest. &apos; &apos;The General Mid account shows the following details of income:&apos;   * Balance/

The .-ioving spirit is Gcorfce Harvey, an active Northern agitator.A.T. Williams, the Yorkshire extremist miner, has been in the South V7ales coalfield in secret conclave with the &quot;rebels&quot; of Cwnparo, Treorchy, Treherbert and Pentre;   he has also met several of the leading local Communists.THE/
- u - rTHE IKDEPEHMT UBOUR PARTYAffiliation to the Third International is likely to be &apos; the rock on which the Independent Labour Party will split at*the annual conference of the Party at Southport on March 27tt 28th and 29th.   The result, unless their propaganda achieve a quite unexpected success,&apos;will probably be the seoession of ti Left Wing to the Communist Party of Great Britain.Another important subject of discussion will be the new policy of the party, which has been outlined in previous . reports, and has already given rise to considerable disagree^AKREST3 AM) KWICHQHS .....   &apos;-,--,On February 11th William Gallaqher was arrested at Liverpool for a speech made in Birmingham on January 27th and was charged at Birmingham Police Court on February 12th.   Bail v/as granted on GallaGher1 s own purety for  100 and two other sureties for  50 each.In connection4with Gallacher!s arrest, two communists named James Cully and Frederick Arthur Raison, were sentenced at Liverpool on February 14th to a fine of 20s. each or 11 days1 imprisonment in default for insulting behaviour.   They v/ere oarrying a banner referring to GallacherTs arrest, and advocating his release.H. Webb, a member of the Executive of the Communist Party of Great Britain, was &quot;&quot;&quot;charged&apos; at Sheffield on February 14th with being a disturber of the peace and for inciting others to commit divers crimes and misdemeanours;   an adjournment was. granted in order to allow Y-ebb to prepare his defence.On February 12th, Khivroum Malik, alias Aldridge, a dentist, and the secretary of the Stoctovell branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain, was fined  2 at WestminsterPolice/
wAccording to a trustworthy informant, Sean McGrath, of the Irish Self-Determination League, has declared that outrages which will got publicity in the newspapers are to be carried out in England.   This seems to bo borne out by the fact that there were three incendiary fires in the London area during tbft tTaek and a bad outbreak of arson in the Manchester district on February 12th.   In tvo cases at Manchester-revolvers were used and in one shots were fired at&apos; the watchman, who had been held up for half an hour.   At least three men were engaged in each outrage and the plot was well organised.   The fires were caused by bottles containing petrol and paraffin. The outrages have created intense indignation in Lancashire.Arthur CBrien, the President of the Irish Self-Determination League, is stilljin hiding and, rather to the scandal of his colleagues who ape remonstrating with him, he* * * .is carrying on a flirtation with\Mrs. MacSwiney with the ^intention of marrying her.   It is possible that her reputed ample means have influenced his inclinations.The Irish campaign of the Labour Party ended with a meeting at the Albert Hall on February 15th.   From 5,000 to 6,000 people were present and the speakers included. George Lansbury, Arthur Greenwood, J. Bromley, Frank Hodges and Margaret Bondfield.  Greenwood described the campaign as the post successful in the history of the Labour movement in spite )t a deliberate Press boycott.   Bromley said, &quot;We have made iQj Jur preparations;   don!t believe that the day or the hour has hanged.   Y/e, have fi:ced a day for the reply of the Government.&quot;He/;ierPolice Court for obstructing the public footway when selling &quot;Tho Communist&quot;.The Rev. H.
