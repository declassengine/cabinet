F. Stewart, C.I.E. (India Office).Secretary. Mr. 0. S. Cleverly (War Office).TEEMS OF REFERENCE.1. To consider Press allegations of extravagance in the conduct of the East Persian operations and report on the broad facts of the position.2. To recommend the form of any system of arbitration or audit to settle up the War Office Account with India, not only in regard to Meshed but generally.
To the Right Hon. W. S. Churchill, M.P.I.-PEESS ALLEGATIONS OF EXTRAVAGANCE IN THE CONDUCT OF THEEAST PERSIAN OPERATIONS.These charges were first made in the article in the Times of India, of which a copy is attached (Appendix A). That article estimated the total cost of the operations at 100,000,000/., and made specific charges of extravagant expenditure on roads, buildings, baths, &amp;c.The Committee have seen a report (Appendix B) from the Government of India on these points, and have also obtained from that Government the further report (Appendix C) annexed. As regards the first point, the total cost of the force in East Persia from its inception in 1915 until 31st March, 1921, is estimated by the Government of India at 16,500,000/. The Committee accept this estimate; and even without any separate report from the Government of India it is clear, from a consideration of the total amounts claimed by India from the War Office for all theatres, that any such figure as 100,000,000/. for East Persia alone is absurd.As regards the charges of extravagance, the Committee have had before them, in addition to the replies from the Government of India, a statement (Appendix D) by a British Service officer who served in East Persia. The Committee are of opinion that the charge of general extravagance, which is clearly in any case greatly exaggerated, is not borne out by the figures and other evidence before them, and that there is no probability that any enquiry now held in London could establish specific instance^ of unnecessary expenditure on any considerable scale. A total expenditure of 650,000/. on works, including roads, for so long a line of communication does not in itself suggest extravagance.It is understood that the India Office desires to issue a communique1 on the subject to the Press, and the data before the Committee appear to provide adequate material for this purpose.C. HARRIS (Chairman). J. B. CROSLAND. E. W. H. MILLAR. W. ROBINSON. S. F. STEWART.III.-RECOMMENDATIONS  AS  TO THE  FORM OF ARBITRATION OR AUDIT TO SETTLE THE WAR OFFICE ACCOUNT WITH INDIA.(1.) Majority Report (War Office and Treasury Members).1. As regards che question of the incidence between Imperial and Indian Exchequers of the. cost of the Meshed Force, we regret that we have been unable to make any advance towards agreement as to Lire method or procedure by which settlement might be reachei The determination of the incidence of the expenditure in question turns upon two quite distinct groups of issues: (a.) Whether, upon the facts, and seeing that India was in fact contributing to the maintenance of other military forces in Persia during the period in question, the Meshed Force was throughout its history &quot; engaged in military operations &quot; outside India, within the meaning of the Government of India Act; and, if so, whether such operations were part of the Great War and subject to the Resolutions passed by Parliament in 1914.(b.) Whether as a matter of policy, and having in view the recent constitutional changes in India, it is expedient that any part of the military expenditure concerned should be charged upon Indian revenues, assuming that such charge is not barred under (a.).2. The questions under (a.) appear to us to be clearly justiciable issues, properly to be determined by an arbitration, on the findings of which the Cabinet itself should proceed to determine the questions of policy under (b.). This would be in harmony with the standing agreement arrived at between the India Office and the Treasury on the recommendation of Lord Welby&apos;s Commission on Indian expenditure, after a correspondence in which the necessity of treating such questions of incidence &quot;in a strictly judicial spirit&quot; had been emphasized by the India Office. Under this agreement, &quot; questions as to the incidence of charge as to which a difference of opinion exists between the India Office and any Department of the Imperial Government are to be submitted to arbitration and the Lord Chief Justice of England has consented to act as arbitrator for this purpose.&quot; (India Office letter to War Office, M. 8493 of 29th July, 1902.)(8964)
It is true, as the India Office members point out in their Report, that the arbitration agreement applies in terms to administrative changes only, and tbat incidence depending upon geographical distribution was separately provided for in the same correspondence, on certain agreed principles, one of which was that &quot; India has a direct and substantial interest in questions affecting Persia and the coast and islands of Arabia and of the Persian Gulf.&quot; &quot;We do not consider that these facts in any way rule out arbitration on the preliminary questions to which we propose that it should be applied.3, The India Office representatives on the Committee are not prepared to agree to submit any of the issues connected with the incidence of the expenditure in question to any form of arbitration. Their reasons, if we correctly apprehend them, are based on the view that the standing arbitration agreement is no longer in force, owing to political changes in India, and that the determining factor in any such dispute under present conditions must be the state of native opinion and feeling in that country.4. In these circumstances we have felt that, so long as there is no willingness to submit any of the issues involved to independent authority, time would not be profitably spent in attempting to draw up an agreed statement of the facts relating to the Meshed Force.5. The only other dispute calling for exceptional means of settlement at the present time is that relating to the Indian War Stores Suspense Account. It has been arranged, since the Committee was appointed, to send representatives of the War Office to India to examine the question on the spot.C. HARRIS (Chairman). J. P). CROSLAND. E W. H. MILLAR.N(2.) Dissentient Report ey India Office Members.The India Office representatives desire to state, with reference to paragraph 3 of the Report of the members of the War Office and Treasury, that their grounds for declining to assent to arbitration are that the question of the determination of the incidence of the expenditure in question turns on a single constitutional issue, namely, whether the expenditure is of a character which can legitimately be imposed on Indian revenues. In the view of the India Office representatives this issue is one which cannot with propriety be referred to arbitration either in whole or in part, and, moreover, the line between the two sets of issues into which the representatives of the War Office and the Treasury desire to split up the question is unreal. The points which the latter suggest (at (a) of their Report) should be put to arbitration are not questions of law or questions of objective fact, but purely questions of classification. Such classification would merely cloud the issue by giving labels, while independently of any label that may be attached, the character of the expenditure, on which alone the decision should rest, is not altered. In fact, the constitutional issue cannot be disentangled from the so-called details, and these form an inherent part of it.2. The standing arbitration agreement referred to in paragraph 2 of the Report is not applicable, inasmuch as it referred only to administrative questions. Questions relating to the incidence of charges for the employment outside India of troops that are borne on the Indian Establishment, were expressly excluded from the agreement and reserved for separate treatment (vide correspondence printed with House of Commons 169 of 1902).3. On the other hand the India Office representatives were prepared to co-operate in order to facilitate consideration by the Cabinet in the preparation of a self-contained statement of the case, in which the views of all the interests affected and the amounts involved should be set out. The War Office, however, did not consider that this course would advance matters and were not prepared to adopt it.W. ROBINSON. S. F. STEWART.0. S. CLEVERLY.Secretary.
APPENDIX A.EAST PERSIA.&quot;Times of India,&quot; 1st December, 1920. . A Public Scandal. (From a Correspondent.)&quot;Various questions have been asked in Parliament, and statements have been made in the British newspapers, as to the waste of British money on the force sent to East Persia. We give to-day what we have every reason to believe to be an accurate version of this misbegotten adventure.Now that the last of the Force in North-East Persia, together with its Line of Communication, has been safely withdrawn, it is permissible to comment on the scandalous expense of this w ild venture.The Force, a Brigade of all arms under the command of General Gaussen, was based on Meshed, with outposts along the Russian border to the north facing the Soviet outposts, which were based on Askabad, Merv and other cities along ihe Central Asian Railway : Herat, on its right rear, also needed attention.The Line of Communication of this Force consisted of 600 miles of road which ran clue south along the Afghan Border to rail bead at Duzdab : thence due east 400 miles of desert railway brought it to Quetca.The Meshed Force was always treated as &quot; Hush-hush &quot; and was never mentioned in home paper,&apos;, the reason being two-fold. In the first place, its very existence depended on secrecy and was a gigantic piece of bluff. At any time the Russians, with a railway all along the frontier, could place anywhere a force of 10 times the strength and far better equipped in guns, aeroplanes and armoured cars, on the Khorassan frontier : at any time, the Afghans from Herat couki cut the Line of Communi-cations : naturally it was inadvisable to talk of the details of the far-flung little Biitish Force. But also it was inadvisable that the British taxpayer should know of this Force, the most expensive for its size in the annals of history and ousting more than our pre-war navy annually, for very ugly questions would have been asked in the House. Whenever questions of the expenditure on our Eastern commitments have cropped up, the answer has always dealt with that of &quot; Mespot and North-West Persia,&quot; North-East Persia being carefully not mentioned.Waste of money, Two years&apos; ago this little force was up in Transcaspia helping the Menshevics and Turkmen ; it was based on-air; its Line of Communications a precarious desert track known as the East Persian Cordon, closed in winter by snow. It was withdrawn from Merv to Meshed, and the construction and com-mand of the Line of Communications proper was entrusted to General Dixon, who had entire control of all expenditure, construction, communications, supplies and building operations, including the building of barracks at Meshed : the hands of the General Officer Commanding Force were rightly kept free to train and keep in readiness the fighting troops which were at the disposal of the Malleson Mission.When General Dixon took over, the discomfort of the troops was thoroughly Indian. In an inspired article to an Indian paper he was quoted as saying &quot; he had not come to read history, but to write it,&quot; and would change the map of Persia : he certainly did change the aspect of the part occupied by the British in East Persia, M magnificently at a magnificent cost.&quot;No one can blame a man for doing his level best for the comfort of troops on field service ; the blame for the fact that the expenditure of the millions of pounds is now utterly wasted (together with a fearful loss of prestige) rests with the Home Government, which refused to declare its policy with regard to East Persia in any definite shape. But when a man who is put in a position of trustee for the expenditure of other people&apos;s money deliberately &quot;rules out with red ink from his dictionary the word Economy &quot; he cannot escape blame.There is no doubt that almost the same degree of corn-fort and efficiency could have been achieved at a far less cost by care, forethought and practical business; but then all unnecessary trimmings, luxuries, advertisements and so forth would have to bo cut out ruthlessly.The line of communications is divided up into stages of roughly 80 miles each and between are p sts a day&apos;s march apart. At the big posts barracks were put up to form the Cantonments for Line of Communication troops and Serais were built at the smaller posts to accommodate troops and convoys on the march.Costly friUs.-Yov a concrete example of waste the very first stage from Meshed can be taken, Turbat-i-Haidari. Here most imposing buildings of stone and concrete were erected, better than most permanent barracks in India, linked to the city by &quot; Dixon Avenue.&apos;&apos; No idea of economising labour or material was di eamt of as is evident from all the numerous detached buildings, some of which were a luxury, but certainly not a necessity on field service. When the buildings were complete it was discovered that they stood on private property and the owner then claimed the most utterly preposterous compensation and had to be paid. Now after being occupied for less than 11 months the whole of this expendituie has had to be scrapped ; a corner of capton-ments is still, occupied by a few Persian Levies and the rest-an utter waste. I cannot state the cost of this cantonment, but I happen to know the figures for another, Birjend, which cost just about 100,000^. sterling, the Kran being round 20 to the   sterling when the bill was paid. This item included seven miles of new road which ran, all but parallel to the old road and certainly made a nice approach to the Headquarters of the Line i f Communications an 1 saved over a mile, but was certainly a luxury for it was of no use for convoys and troops on the march and only useful for motor cars. Two ye*r.s&apos; camel hire would have more than sufficed to run a rail-way up to Meshed, tapping the merchaudise to Khoras-san and Central Asia and saving the lives of countless camels for use elsewhere. There was no end to the &quot; im-provement&quot; of the road ; in one part there is a new-road 19 miles long which was never taken into use.Derelict gold. We have left a 600 mile chain of derelict barracks, serais, messes, ice-houses, temples, musjids, swimming-baths and so on to testify to the wealth of England and dimensions of its taxes. A few hours after the last column left Meshed a mob of Persians with gendarmerie arid soldiers could be seen stripping the barracks, pulling the timber out of the roof, uprooting the wooden verandah pillars and loading all into four-horsed wagons. No one will water the trees imported from Quetta on the &quot;Dixon Drives&quot; and the &quot; Dixon Avenues,&quot; but for many years to come the road will be clearly marked by the scrapped Ford vans and the bones of thousands upon thousands of dead camels. Not one of these barracks has been occupied a full year.What some of the road or building or camel contractors have made out of the British (Government would make even a multi-millionaire turn green with envy. The way even the Persian stonemasons learnt to put up their wages just as often as they pleased would have amazed the coal strikers at home. The biggest camel contractor was once fined a staggering sum of money ; such were his enormous profits that he could afford to take it smiling.England pays.-Ii ever the British taxpayer learns the total cost for the past two years of this little force with its line of communications, ie., with every item added in and no camouflage, it will have an indiscribable shock. No one in Persia or India seems to know exactly what the cost of this venture has been, and I doubt if Mr. Churchill dare give it, even if he knew it. It is generally supposed to be about 37,000,OUOZ. sterling a-year. I am fully convinced this is far below the mark, and that ifor the total bill, if honestly set forth, very little change will be seen out of 100,000,000^. sterling. The secret of this reckless waste is not hard to trace  England pays the bill, not India.
GAt the other end of the Hue i3 a very different picture. A few miles from Quetta is one of the worst camps in India, at Baleli. Here for three years a cavalry brigade has suffered the most intolerable discomfort of sweltering heat and dust, or biting cold and dust. I went out and saw it, and never had I set eyes on a more dismal, treeless waste. I was told that one commanding officer put in a bill for under 25/., spent on building huts of mud and reeds for his officers in lieu of tents, and a shelter to cook in, half his officers being sick, and was refused repayment !  The bill would have to be met by India.My sojourn in the East as a soldier has not taught me much business !&quot; Exfin Libre.&quot;&quot;Times,&quot; 23rd December, 1920.Waste in the Wilderness.(From our own Correspondent.)Bombay, 19th December (delayed). The Times of India, in discussing Mr. OhurchiH&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on 16th December, on the 16,250,000/. spent in East Persia, asserts that exact details of the expenditure referred to in The Times on 3rd De-ceniber are available, but that the &quot;War Office dare not present them to Parliament The newspaper repeats that the information which it published on 30th November about the outlay of nearly 100,000,000/. on temporary works in Eastern Persia is based on unimpeachable authority.APPENDIX B.From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State.(No. 526.) Delhi, 13th December, 1920.Your telegram rlated 3rd December, No. 3814, and No. 3982, dated 11th December. Following are approximate figures of cost of Malleson Mission proper, in thousands of pounds sterling: 1918-19, 500 ; 1919-20, 100; and 1920-21, 50. Figures are only approximate, as no separate accounts of Mission proper are available at Headquarters. Total cost of troops in South and ,East Persia is 11,304 in 1219-20, and 5,100 in 1920-21. ^ These figures include approximately for cost of troops in East Persia, inclusive of Malleson Mission proper, 8,000 in1919-20, and 4,500 in 1920-21. Here, too, actual figures cannot be given as accounts received at Headquarters are for East and South Persia together. It is not possible to give readily similar figures before 1919-20, as separate accounts by theatres were not compiled before that year.2. Our estimates of recoverable war expenditure, as tolegraphed to you on 13th November last, make no allowance for contribution of India towards cost of Malleson Mission proper.3. We hope to telegraph to you our views on question of incidence, shortly.APPENDIX C.From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State.(No. 75.) Delhi, 15th January, 1921.Part. I. (? Your telegrams) dated 14th December and 4th January, Nos. 4038 and 66. Total cost, including works of troops in East Persia, from 1915-16 to end of 1920-21 is calculated roundly at pounds sterling 16 , of which approximately :pounds 650 thousand represents expenditure on works, that is to say, roads and accom-modation, including about pounds 100 thousand for ex-penditure in India. It is impossible to give (? separately) expenditure on road from railhead in Baluchistan to Meshed.2. An estimate of cost of total programme of building was called for by us in July, 1919, and the result (? was) reported to you in British Consul-Generals No. 13891, dated 13th October, 1919, in which we informed you that the total estimated cost of hutting under construction was Es. (1 56) lakhs, of which about 19 lakhs has been expended by 1st August, 1919. Estimates were not strict estimates of ordinary peace time procedure. They were estimates of the character which it was possible to (? formulate) under field service conditions, and on which it was found necessary to rely in other field service areas besides East Persia.3. In the same telegram, 13th October, 1919, we asked for orders which would enable us to avoid as far as possible unnecessary expenditure on hutting, and in my telegram No. (? 12) 655, dated 16th September, 1919, we had also asked for orders on the subject of accommoda-tion to be provided. We received no specific answer to these telegrams ; but in your telegram, No P. 4118, dated 20 ch October, 1919, you authorized certain arrange-ments to be made for winter accommodation, clothing and supplies. You will see that expenditure as now reported corresponds fairly closely to estimate for 1919.Part II.-4. The scale of accommodation for Indian troops provided in East Persia was only about two-thirds of that allowed in plains in India. One bedroom was provided for each officer (? magnitude) 15 feet by 14 to 12 feet by 12 feet and a Bengal bathroom and generally a small mess house with only sufficient room to seat the officers in the station was provided. The reference to the swimming baths can, as far as we can judge on the information available here, only be a grotesque and malicious exaggeration of certain arrange-ments made at Korin and Shusp. At the former place water was let into an existing excavation in the ground which was then used for bathing, at Shusp, which wasthe Sanitarium (sic 1 Sanitorium) of the lines of com-munications, a small reservoir was formed by damming a stream primarily to increase water available for growing vegetables for the troops. This reservoir was incidentally used for bathing.5. The accusation regarding temples is equally untrue. At Birjand the men themselves constructed a small Masjid and a Sikh Gurdwara in their leisure hours. The buildings were of the most rudimentary description and no Government materials were used. Similar structures may have been built elsewhere on the line, but they were not built at the expense of the Government.6. The statement regarding ice houses has no found-atiou in fact of which we are aware. It is possible in the northern part of the line where snow falls in winter, underground storage in pits for snow may have been constructed similar to those which are used in certain parts of India. Any expenditure iucurred in construction of such pits could only be negligible, but we have no knowledge that any such -war, actually incurred.Part III. 7. The provision of buildings for accommo-dation of troops was necessary for the maintenance of efficiency. The maximum temperature ranges from 125 degrees in hot weather to many degrees below freezing point in the cold weather. The prevalence of dast storms makes some form of protection necessary, as it is impossible to cook and eat in the open, and tents are insufficient against heat stroke (?) as was proved by the number of cases prior to the erection of buildings. Owing to severe cold in the winter it was essential to provide some reasonably comfortable accommodation for (? troops) to prevent their entering the Persian villages for sake of warmth. These villages are incredibly filthy, and tick fever, (?) baltic, fever and typhus are (? popular). The incidence of disease would have been extremely heavy had these buildings not been provided, whereas percentage of serious sick casis during the (? withdrawal) was under two per cent, of the whole of the personnel in (?East) (? Persia). We have in our possession photo-graphs of certain of the buildings erected on the East Persian line, which effectively dispose the idea that the scale or form of buildings was extravagant, and we propose to forward these to you by Secretary&apos;s letter.8. We are also sending you by post the relevant portions of financial officer&apos;3 report referred to in para, graph 3 of my telegram No, 568, of 17th December, in lieu of telegraphic summary there promised.
APPENDIX D.NOTE BY CAPTAIN A. LAITHWAITE, D.S.O., ON THE &quot; TIMES OF INDIA &quot; ARTICLE ONEAST PERSIA, DATED 4th DECEMBERI have read the article in the Times of India, and can safely say that it is a gross exaggeration. I do not know the line between Birjand and Meshed which I have never travelled over, but I served for a year at Birjand itself (October, 1919, to September, 1920, as G.S.O., 3rd Grade, of the Line of Communications), and I can speak with knowledge of conditions there, and down the line from Birjand to Duzdap and Quetta.1. Buildings- All buildings at Birjand and on the line between there and Duzdap which were put up by us were of mud and straw or wattle. There was no stone building at any stage. The illustrations in the book of sketches will show the type of building. I understand that at Turbat-i-Haidari to the north of Birjand there were, as the article says, some new stone buildings, but so far as I know by report, Turbat was the only place, even to the north of Birjand, where new stone buildings were put up.2.Luxury buildings. The 77ffles article says &quot; we have left a 600-mile chain of derelict barracks, serais, messes, icehouses, temples, musjids, swimming baths and so on.&quot; I can say definitely that-(a.) There were no icehouses at any part of the line, unless very improbably at Meshed. At Birjand we got ice once or twice from the Persian Governor when he was our guest, but we had no plant. There were, however, four small soda-water plants, at Birjand, Shusp, Hurmuk and Duzdap, employing, perhaps, ten men each, and this is possibly at the bottom of the story.(6.) There was no swimming bath to my knowledge anywhere along the line, and at Birjand and elsewhere along the line the only form of bath was an IG. tub. The men used to swim in the local irrigation works at Birjand, but these, of course, were Persian, and were not set up by us.As for temples: we put up three biggish masjids, one at Meshed (which I never saw), one at Birjand, and one at Duzdap. None of them would hold over 200 people All were of mud and straw, whitewashed. At Birjand there was in addition a Mahommedan temple.Serais. There were posts all along the line on an average every 25 miles between Meshed and Neh, with a serai at each, which would hold some 30-35 people, and was built of mud.Between Neh and Duzdap there were no serais, but tents were served out to each party which handed them in on arrival at Hurmuk, Shusp or Birjand as the case might be.3. Ford vans and camels. The Times says: &quot; For many years to come the road will be clearly marked by the scrapped Ford vans and the bones of thousands upon thousands of dead camels.&quot; This is true so far as the camels are concerned, but between Birjand and Duzdap there were exactly two abandoned Ford cars when I came down the line in the beginning of September, 1920. These had had wheels, engines, all fittings, rubber parts, steering gear, &amp;c, salvaged, and only the body remained.4. Roads. The new road was 10 to 12 feet wide, un-metalled. It was really not much more than a levelled tract kept clean and clear over hard stoney ground.The statement made in the Times article that there was a new stretch of 7 miles of road between Birjand and Mud is correct. But it is not correct to say that it was used only for motors once it was opened it was used for all traffic. It cut off a large corner, and so saved a considerable distance. None of the roads round Birjand or between there and Duzdap had lines of trees along them : there were a few trees at the serais. Trees were, however, sent up the line from Quetta to Turbat and planted there (with the approval of Headquarters at Quetta) to compensate, it was said, for the deaffore-station of the country.I think it will be seen from this that the allegations in the Times article are grossly exaggerated. But if there are any other points which it is desired to clear up, I shall be glad to give any information in my power.
