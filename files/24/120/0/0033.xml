THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSJyS .&amp;QVDHMBNTPRESENT TENDENCY OF WAQES. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour,SORBET.In a memorandum to the Cabinet dated May 7th, 192Q,(   633.       I outlined the wages position at that date and pointedout that wages were still generally increasing;   The memorandum stated that they would probably go on lnereasing until prioes reaohed a point at which the consumer would go without rather than pay and until a financial reaction set in.   This reaction, as is common knowledge, has ooourred.   Prioes have roaohod a level in many oases at which oonsumers refuse to buy, and in consequence of liquidation of accumulated stooks, of reductions in prices of imported raw materials and of other causes, the general prioe level has already begun to fall.   The fall started last summer, beginning with grain and cotton.   The Immediate result haa been that buyers have held off until the ooBt of manufactured articles should refleot the fall in price of raw materials;   oontraots have been cancelled; shipping freights have fallen rapidly, and manufacturers have been afraid to manufacture for stook on a falling market.   The consequence has been a considerable volume of unemployment, whloh will be relieved partially when stooks have been disposed of and more fully when a lower price level is reaohed.The movement in retail prioea is shown by the index number published in the Labour Gazette.   This number stood at &apos; 155 at the beginning of August, rose to 176 in November, last month fell to 165, and this month has fallen further to 151. fThe ,figures include rent and rates, whioh are increasing^/The effect on ^ages of this situation is very dear. With minor exceptions no further increases are being given; general reductions affecting the whole trade have been made
In a few industries and Individual reductions in.a muoh larger number of isolated instances, while further reductions of wages are foreshadowed.Reductions in wages of this oharaoter have been unknown In this oountry sinoe the beginning of the war, and the industrial position will for this reason be difficult for some time,   The difficulties will not be made easier, by the faot that the reduction of wholesale pyloes is outstripping the reduotion in retail prices and many employers will plead that their factories oannot afford present wages, while the workers will reply that they oannot very well live on less.  A similar situation exists in other countries and in America heavy reductions of wages have already taken plaoe.The position can be seen in some detail as follows:-(l) The Post of Living Group.   There is a number of trades whose wages are regulated directly by the rise or fall of the Ministry of Labours index number of the ooot of living.   These are the Woollen Trade in Yorkshire, the Railway Servioe, Polioe Service, Oivil Service, the Print-ing, Bleaching and Dyeing trade and a number of minor industries.   In these oases wages have automatically oome down or are likely soon to come down in sympathy with the fall in the index number.(E) Trades whioh feel acutely the present slump. In the Tinplate industry in South Wales very high prices and very high wages were, until recently, obtained. Latterly the demand has fallen off so suddenly that wages have been readjusted on the basis of a sliding soale following the price of steel, and substantial reductions
of wages have resulted.   In the Non-Ferrous Mining Industry in a number of oases the mines have actually dosed down, and in others, notably in the tin mines-in Cornwall, a reduotion in wages of about 10$ has ooourred.   In the Hosiery Trade in Sootland a reduotion of 15$ has been enforced.   In a number of Industries, notably Cotton and other Textiles, Flour-Milling, leather and Boots, short-time Is being worked on aooount of the falling off in demand resulting in part at any rate from tho high price necessitated by the high ffost of production and also of course from the diffioultiee in foreign trade caused by the uncertain movements of rates of exchange&apos;(3) Other important trades.   In the Ingineering Trade a demand of the Trade Unions for an increase of 6d an hour has been postponed.   The wages of men have been stabilised for a period of 6 months, but wages of women have been generally reduced from the standards set up by the Ministry of Munitions during the war to a somewhat lower standard agreed by Trade Boards operating in the manufactured metal trades.   In the Shipbuilding Trade a similar demand for an increase of 6d a week has been negatived.   In the Building Trade there sre abundant signs that the cost of building is so high as to impede extended building work.   The Trade Unions have tabled demands for etlll further increases of wages, but it is unlikely that these will be oonoeded and reductions may be attempted beforo long.   The wages of labourers in tradeB bordering on the Building Trade, such as road and Bewer work and navvies1 work generally, have been reduced in a number of eases from the present Building Labourers&apos; rate of E/ld, an hour to rates of l/lld. and l/9d. an hour.   In general, employers have shown a much more
determined opposition to inoreases of wagest   In the Shipbuilding Industry a stubborn strike has boon going on sinoe the beginning of Deoember due to the aotion of the Shipbuilding employers in withdrawing an increase of wages of 12/- a week given last April to Ships Joiners to deter them from migrating to the Building Trade.Erade Board Trades.  Even in Trade Board trades, where In theory the statutory Trade Beard rates are minimum (and not actual) rates, designed to prevent sweating, there is a number of instances in which demands for increases of wages hare been postponed with the acquiesoenoe of the workers1 representatives, while in some oasos tho employers of the Trade Boards are making proposals for reductions.   In the oase of the Jute Trade Board, the employers have stated that they are unable to pay even the minimum rate fixed by the Trade Board.   The wages fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board and Committees are now said by the employers to be generally too high, principally due to the faot that imported wheat can be sold in this oountry at a price below that at whioh it is possible to grow it here.(5) women&apos;s Wages. Wages of women are being affeoted by the present depression.   Reference has already been made to the Engineering Trade, and there is a tendency la many trades for wages to be reduoed to a standard such as the minimum rates fixed by Trade Boards*(6) As may be supposed, the price of fuel has an important bearing on the prioe level.   The export prioe oi coal has fallen heavily.  The gains which this oountry was making in. this respect have provided a fund which in part has gone to pay increased wages of miners, but this fund is now disappearing.   The home price ofm Am
ooal is inadequate for the present costs of production. The Government will shortly de-ocntrcl the mines and the ooal owners and the miners are discussing the wages question in the light of the price of coal both for home and for export.   As a result of the settlement of the ooal strike a big increase in the output of coal occurred, and the output for December justified an increase in wages of 3/6d per shift.   Since the making up of those figures the demand for ooal has decreased and there will be a consequent fall in wages of 2/-per shift.   It is obvious that tho wagos negotiations in the coal mining industry will be difficult but it is also clear that a deorease in the price of coal would be of great benefit to Industry generally.(7) As indicated in the previous memorandum, the polioy of leaving the settlement of wages and conditions of employment to negotiations between Employers and Trade Unions has been continued, and it is clear that it has been in tho best interests of the country.   The general praotioe of the Ministry of labour is not to intervene in disputos about wages until all available machinery for settlement by an industry itself has been exhausted.   When a dispute cannot be settled by these methods a voluntary reference to a standing Court of Arbitration, viz., the Industrial Court, can be arranged. The Y/ages (Temporary Regulation) Act, by which wages were maintained at the level obtaining at the armistice, lapsed in September last and it was not renewed in spite of some , pressure from Trade Union quarters since it was thought that the time had come when Government intervention in wages matters should ooase except of course in tradesM 5&quot;
whore organisation Is bad and whore rates of wages are unduly low.    Joint organisation of industry has made oon-siderable progress.   Before tho war there were roughly 4 million Trade Unionists and there are now nearly 8 million.   On the v/hole the Joint Industrial Councils and other similar joint bodies are working tfell.   There are not.-many oases oi reduotions of wages brought about without aonsultation between both sides;   the attitude of Joint Industrial Couhdtls and oth^r similar bodies to this matter indicates that the Inevitable reiuetions will be oarried out only after full consideration and without avoidable hardship.It may be that, in view of the effeot of wages rates on employment, the workers will realise that the matter upon whioh they should concentrate is not so much the maintenance of the present level of monoy wages as the establishment of methods of bo adjusting money wages as to oeoure a high level of real wages, and it Is to he hoped that employers and employed will explore this question.   It is, of oourse, bound up with the question of increased output por unit, a matter to which publio attention has been called repeatedly in recent months.(Signed) T. J. LUCNAMARA.MINISTRY OF IdBOUR,25th February, 1921.
