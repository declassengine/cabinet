SECREli CP.-2656.HIS DOC IMF-NT IS THE PROPBOT OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)copy No.     ^XC ABIME T.THS POSITION IN IRELAND. Note by the President of the Board of Education. .The Chief Secretary for Ireland confronts his odious ana thankless task with so &quot;buoyant a coiirage that he deserves all the assistance which his colleagues can give him.      These few words are intended not to hinder but to help..The Government cannot permit a hostilo Republic to be set up by foroe of arms in the south of Ireland.   We are compelled, however reluctant we may be to do so, to take up the challenge of Sinn Fein and to put down a rebellion whioh was none of our seeking.    Our policy will certainly have failed unless it has effectually demonstrated not only to the leaders but to the rank and file of Sinn Fein that Secession is a lost cause and that some other solution of the Irish Question must tie found.Prom the evidence before me, I imagine that this opinion is now widely, if not universally, shared in Ireland.       The leaders of Sinn Fein,do see that they are asking for a thing which this Country cannot give* The rank and file of their supporters realise that they have been led into an enterpise,which can only succeed, if at all, by a great ohange of opinion in this Country* On the other hand, the leaders of Sinn Fein are unable to come out into the open*      They have been elected by their constituents as Republicans^ and even if there were no ,,.
no fear of the extremist bullet, the sentiment of honour would preclude them from making a formal renunciation of Republican principles.   I under-at and that there is no member of the Dail who does not consider himself bound to support the Irish Republic until such time as the Irish doctorate has changed its view.   Wo are, therefore, confronted with this situation that the leaders of Sinn Jfoin are precluded from coming out into the open with moderate suggestions, however much they nay be convinced that their original programme caaoot now be eXocuted.      The policy of the Oovornment, therefore, has so far succeeded that it has broken up tho organisation of a hostile Republic aad convinced the great body Of;Its supporters that they are. fighting in a desperate cause.   On the .other hand it has- failed to produce any public professions of apostasy from thepolitical leaders of Sinn Fein and,, what is more important, so far from narrowing the circle of our opponents, has had the effect of greatly on-larging*it.      &apos;tfhilo it is true that there may be some quiet people who are-revolted by Sinn l?eio, there are many more who are estranged by the methods pursued by the British Executive in Ireland.    The great body of tho population appear to be behind the Irish Republican Army. Many of the moderates have joined them.    The searching for arras and the domiciliary&quot; visits increase the irritation-tloa, especially as it is inevitable that many peaceable citizens- should tiuffor in the process.   The natural tendency ot the Irishman is hot to put the blame
on Sinn-Fein, whioh is the original cause of these troubles, but upon the British -  overifineint which is the proximate and palpable a^ent of social molestation.      The fe]tlTng, therefore, against the British Government would appear td have beoome -&apos;: distinctly worse instead of distinctly better.-If we were dealing.with a calm and reasonable population, susceptible to argument, it might bo easy to persuade them all is for the best in&apos; the best possible of worlds, under that were they only to repudiate the Ginn pein Leaders happiness would be restored to Ireland.    But,!we are not dealing with a reasonable population and at the moment public opinion is&quot;far too much, inflamed to listen to appeals of&apos;this icind. Furthermore, the peaceable population of Ireland&apos; have a legitimate grievance in the indiscipline which prevails, or has prevailed, in some eom-X)anies of the Auxiliary Police.    I take it that it is common ground that indiscipline should be rooted out of this 2orce and that it Bhould be restored to order without delay.     It is certain that unless the British public aro&apos; &apos; satisfied on this point there will be a grave revul-sion of feeling which will affect the credit of the Government ana ;the success ofthe Government&apos;s policy.
But the restoration of discipline does not seom to me to be enough.   We should, I am &quot;convinced, he prepared to consider very seriously once again the question of a Truce. This matter was last oxaminod in connection with the suggestion that advantage should be taken of the better feeling which might be sxpeoted to prevail at Christmas time to secure a cessation of hostilities, but the proposal fell.through because the Cabinet, on military advice, considered it necessary to require tho surrender of arms and to this the rebels would not consent,   $hey held the view that a Truco was one thing and a Surrender another, and indoed tho distinc-tion is obvious..   But now we are approaching the tine when it will he necessary to put the - Government - of Ireland Act into operation.   I notice that the Chief Secretary suggests that the let should be put into Operation in the Worth first and in Southern Ireland at a later date   This course may be neces-sary, hut it is a pis aller presenting both inconveniences and dangers which should certainly be avoided if there is any reasonable chance of obtaining an atmosphere in which elections can be held in Southern Ireland.   How, I suggest that the Government should attempt to obtain such an atmosphere by making a general announcement that after a given date the Forces of the O::o*n will be prepared for a cessation of hostilities to last over the election tine if the other side is equally prepared to respect the Truce.. It would not be necessary to negotiate with individuals.   A public announce^ ment would be made that hostilities would cease on a given day, and that if after that day, Sinn Fein violated the Truce, the pressure would, of course, be resumed on our side. The soldiers will, no doubt, tell us that a Truce Will only give to Sinn ?ein an opportunity of perfecting its organisa-tion.   This objection whioh applies to all truces, does notoutweigh- 3Cb-
outweigh the countervailing ^vantages, and in any case,is less formidable in Ireland than elsewhere, for in acou; try in which the vast majority of the -population aresecret agents of tho cnomy the intelligence organisation will always be pretty good, and is moro likely to .ieterioratoduring a Truce than i-uriue a period of active operations.   Onthe other hand, the arguments ior the !.&apos;ruoe are very strong:-(1)   It woulc demonstrate to Irishmon that the Government is serious in its desire to establish:a Parliamentary Constitution in the South,(Z)   It seems probable that ii the fiahtin? once dies down - - It will be difficult: for the rebels to.$ot up again.-(6)   In the quieter atmosphere of a. Truce moderate men nay come together and the avenues of compromise may be : explored, -. r      . .(4)   The longer the .civil war goes on in Ireland, the more -1 certain d&quot;ues it. become that .groat bodies of opinion in &apos; this Country will be swung over to the Republican side, -Already Mr; Henderson has advocated the concession oi the full Sinn i:&apos;cin claims in Parliament.Meanwhile.i: I think, it is. important th,t the death sentence should bo reserved.for oases of brutal murder andshould not be carried out upon rebels taken in the course of active military operations or found in possession of arms.These sentences only serve to increase.the exasperation andexorcise no deterrent influence&apos;,       term,of imprison-ment.would be equally effectual in removing opponents from thefighting line, would not horrify, the feelings of tender-hearted people here, and would shorten the list of Irishmartyrs * &apos; Our soldiers do not seem to., understand thotragic passion of the Irish race,for martyrdom,&apos;    not us notfeed it if a better way can be..found, -(3d) Ha.L.IlI3B3R. .Education,    v V--- - .Whitehall, ,3.W*. ,st March, 1981,
