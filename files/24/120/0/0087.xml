From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Dcjuirl inent, Hl,\\lavrh liCI.283!)i^.    , r K^s^Jear the line, ^IIALLJ^days.   Ai,,hm,l.sl,u,,   VoUeceived o p.in.Our telegram of 5th March hist, 1,&apos;HH, lias been repealed to I)ol)l)s willi following addilioh :&quot;Order in which you should now proceed is left to you r discretion. Kssenlial points are (\) Von should break oil negotiations if Afghans refuse your demands regarding Bolshevik Consulates and intrigue. (.-) Vou should demand disclosure of Bolshevik treaty, and at (dice report result and terms, if disclosed, fur orders with your recommendations, (o) In following Secretary of ,Slato&apos;s injunction regarding your attitude over Bolshevik subsidy, you should lake your stand on viceroys letter of 7th November. Your attitude to gills of arms should as far as possible ho similar. (I) You should make treaty subject to ralilieatioiisAs regards disclosure of Bolshevik treaty, we are not sullieienfly sure of your intention to give Dobbs instructions beyond those at [2) above. If Afghans disclose treaty, well and good. It will be repeated to you, and our course of action will be finally decided. But position is not so clear if Afghans, having accepted our stipulation regarding Bolshevik Consulates, lake up attitude that such accceptance has put draft of treaty out of action, and that, new draft is being negotiated. Are we, then, still to insist on being shown old draft, or to wail for the new one V Hence it seemed best to instruct Dobbs simply to insist on disclosure and report result. We trust that our instructions are approved.Bolshevik subsidy question will receive our most earnest reconsideration in the light of vour remarks on receipt of Dobbs&apos; report.   But we would now remind vouthat quite apart from their main anti-British design-, Bolsheviks may conceivably think (like ourselves AIghauisrun s good neighbouriiness worth buying in view of her powers for trouble on the border, especially in Bokhara.
