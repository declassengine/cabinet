Government).Secret. Copy No.   3__CP, 26oiCabinet.HTORANOTI BY THE.PRESIDENT Off THE BOARD OP BPaCATIOH AND THE MINISTER OIF LABOUR ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUVENILE EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES, BTOiAUX Aiti) EXCHANGES.We find it necessary to submit to the Cabinet the problem presented by certain difficulties which have arisen in connection with Juvenile Employment.      Over 600,000 boys and girls each year leave the Elementary Schools of England and Wales and a large and increasing number of these seek the advice and help of those whose duty it is to have knowledge of the opportunities afforded in commerce and industry in any area, and to have concern for the future welfare of the child. This worV is done:-(a) in 130 areas by Juvenile Advisory Committees, whose powers are derived from regulations made under the Labour Exchanges Act 1909.      These are statutory bodies appointed for a term of three years and maintained financially by the Ministry of Labour.(b) in 100 areas by Choice of Employment Committees, acting as sub-committees of the local education authority in accordance with the provisions of the Choice of ^ployment Act 1910, and maintained by the local education authority and the Board of Education with assistance from the Ministry of
Labour in respect of certain administrative.expenses.     (The generlfc term for both types ofCommittee is &quot;Juvenile jimployment Committee&quot;).On these committees are represented the local educational authority, employers and employed, and also .. .. those interested in the welfare of children and young persons.It is from, the divided responsibility for machineryof this description that difficulties have occurred, inwhich we no1-: seek the decision of the Cabinet.Ve are unfortunately not in full agreement withregard to the course to be pursued end our separate viewson the question are contained in the subsequent memoranda.Ve are however agreed on the following points.1. The task of advising boys and girls as totheir choice of employment and watching with great care the early years of their industrial life is work of the highest national importance, as valuable to industry as it is beneficial to the individual.2. The success of this work is seriously..- jeopardised by conflicts which have arisen in recent years between certain local education authorities and the Ministry of Labour.3. This divergence proceeds from, (a) the fact thatthe interests involved are both&apos;industrial and educational and the two sets of Committees approach the matter from different points of v-Iev?, and (b) the reluctance of certain responsible local authorities to share the responsibility with local agencies established by and responsible to a Government Department.
The Memorandum issued in 1911 (see Appendix) over the joint signature of the President nf the Board of Education and the President of the Board of Trade represents an attempt to establish a modus Vivendi and ensure the co-operation of all interested parties.This concordat has failed to produce the desired effect, and its failure indicates the disadvantages of any system, whereby either locally or centrally the responsibility for the work is divided.It is therefore imperative that some adjustment should be made, which Tvill assign responsibility to a single authority, locally and centrally, and will at the same time ensure the close co-operation of local education authorities with the Employment Exchanges.H. A. L. FISHER(President of the Board of Education.)J. liACKAliARA(Minister of Labour).
1.        A concordat was made between my predecessor and the President of the Board of Trade in 1911, which divided the local exeoutive responsibility under the Choice of Employment Aot, 1910, between the Looal ISduoation Authorities and the Labour Exchanges.   This arrangement   even where it has been carried out has always given rise to difficulty and has now broken down.   There is great reluotance on the part of responsible Looal Sduoation Authorities to share their looal responsibility with officers or agencies established by and , responsible directly to a central Government Department other than the Board of Education, and no amount of argument has prevailed against this fundamental objection.*2. Starting from the proposition in paragraph 5 of our joint memorandum to which we hare both been driven by our experience of unhappy looal controversies, it appears to me inconceivable that the single central authority should be other than the Board of liJduoation, and that the single local authority should bs other than the Local I&amp;uoation Authority.In my opinion the dominating factor is still the Choice of Employment Act, 1910, which entitles Local ISduoation Authorities, subject only to the approval of the Board of Education, to undertake the work in question.   This Act was in substance, although not in form, an amendment of the Labour Sxchanges Act, 1909, intended to meet criticisms brought against that Aot during its passage through Parliament, and to oarry out the declaration of the present Secretary of State for War, who was the Minister in charge of the Bill, in his speech on the second reading:     wIt is very necessary that, in dealing withItUMORAlTOUH BY TH3 PR3SIDSWT 0? TICS BOARD OF EDUCATION ON TICS ADMINISTRATION 07 JuVBNILB BMPLOYKaLNT EXCHANGES.
ft,    *&apos;&quot;young persons, educational interests Bhould predominate orer &quot;any commercial interests,   ne hare no intention whatever of &quot;placing upon the Labour Bxchanges the prime work of placing &quot;young people in employment.&quot;    The policy of the Choice of imployment Act was reviewed and confirmed by Parliament when the I&amp;uoation Act, 1918, was under consideration, and the age of the young persons with whom the Local Eduoation Authorities might deal was raised from 17 to 18 with the asBent of the Ministry of Labour,   Any change which would place the responsibility for the work elsewhere than in the hands of the Local Education Authorities, or would dis-sooiate this work from the rest of their educational work done under the supervision and financial control of the Board of -Education, would entail a repeal or amendment of the Choice of Employment Act, find I am convinced that any legislation in this direction would be a retrograde step and would meet with uncompromising opposition from the Authorities.3, The financial aspect of the problem is by no meansunimportant,   if the Local Education Authority is made the responsible local agency, it will bear half the cost out of the rates (except in so far as existing arrangements by which the cost of printing, postage and stationery is borne by the Ministry of Labour are continued or similar arrangements are made by the Board of Education),   If the Local Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Labour and the xitaploynent jSxohange is made the responsible local agency, the whole coBt will fall on the Exchequer,4, I do not contemplate that the Local Mucation AuthorityBhould, at all events for the present, be compelled by legislation to undertake the work;   nor do I contemplate that the Ministry of Labour and the Employment Exchanges should be
precluded from doing the work where the Local iSduoation Authority refuses or neglects to do it.   We cannot afford to leave the area of a Local Education Authority without any agency for Juvenile ISmploymont work.   For some time to come it will, I think, he inevitable that in some areas the work should still he done under tho Ministry of Labour&apos;s organisation.&apos;   But I do contemplate that where the Local Eduoation Authority wishes to provide the looal agency for the work, it should be allowed as of right to take the full and sole responsibility for it under the Board of iSducation,   Of course, it would be the duty of the Board of jSduoation to see that the Looal Sduoation Authority does its work adequately and properly, and it would be well to keep alive the power of the Ministry of Labour to do the work if only to provide an alternative in case of the default of the Looal Bduoation Authority or the inefficient performance of their work.   I do not think that any legislation would be required for these purposes.5. In my opinion the fundamental question, viz., what should be the single central and single local authority responsible for the work, is not one for the settlement of which procedure by way of Inquiry and the taking of evidence is necessary or suitable.   The object of the Inquiry proposed by the Minister of Labour is to satisfy the susceptibilities of those who hare co-operated with the Ministry in the work of the Looal Advisory Committees.   For this purpose publicity is essential, and it would involve fighting out over again before the persons holding it the unhappy and unseemly local controversies which have created the present situation.   It would moreover mean yet more delay in arriving at a settlement which is already very long overdue:   the powerful Association
of Education Committees has for many month past been complaining with increasing bitterness of the delay caused by the differences of opinion between the two Government Departments concerned.     On the other hand if the Cabinet will itself decide to uphold the responsibility of the Local Education Authorities and the Board of Education, I see no objection to and many advantages in a subsidiary inquiry devoted to ascertaining the lines upon which, consistently with that primary responsibility, co-operation in industrial matters between the Local Education Authorities and the Employment Exchanges can best be secured.     This is a question of administration, not of principle,6. I recognise the value of the work which has been done byvolunteers serving on Juvenile advisory Committees.   It is however, I believe, the case that something like half of the members of these Committees are themselves representatives appointed by Looal Education Authorities,    Nor do I feel any doubt that the services and experience of the others would be gladly welcomed by Authorities on their Choice of iinployment Committees, and it would certainly be my advice to Authorities that they should utilize such voluntary assistance to the full.   In faot, the demand for voluntary workers in connection with education is at present so great, not only on Choice of Employment Committees but also on Care Committees and in connection with Clubs, Scout Troops, and other organizations subsidiary to education, that I cannot conceive of any adequately equipped voluntary worker failing to find the fullest scope,7. I am conscious of the complications introduced by theUnemployment Insurance Aot, 1920.   I do not however see any reason why, bo far as the actual machinery of disbursing benefits is ooncemed, the Looal iiiucation Authorities should
not aot as the agents of the Ministry of Labour, or even why with due safeguards, the Ministry of Labour should not, as a rule, accept the opinion of the Looal Education Authority as to whether a young person claiming benefits is or is not genuinely unable to obtain suitable employment.   The precise nature of these safeguards might well be explored in the course of suoh a subsidiary inquiry as I suggest.H.A.L.STSHER.
MEMORANDUM BY THE MIHXST&amp;R 0? LABOUR.THE INDUSTRIAL ASP3S0T     PROPOSAL FOR AM. EHQ,UIRY,The question at issue appears to me to divide itself very naturally into two parallel problems1* Central Control,   On this point I would refer the attention of the Cabinet to the following passage in paragraph 88 of the Report furnished recently by the Committee of Enquiry, presided over by Mr. Barnes, into the work of the Employment Exchanges.&quot;We feel bound however to express our &quot;conviction that th^ present situation &quot;should,, with ar rhort a delay ao &quot;possible, be altered by the recognition &quot;of a single Government Department as &quot;primarily responsible for this subject &quot;in all areas&quot;.With this view I am wholly in accordi   It is of paramount importance to industry at the present time that, as far as the State can assist in these matters, the questions of entry, selection after care and training of boys and girls in industry should be the concern of a single department. This work done wisely and whole-heartedly now will contribute beyond computation to the happiness and efficiency of the mid-century generation.   It remains only to decide which department shall assume responsibility throughout the country.2* Local Control.    Recent legislation has tended todraw this work in two directions, which appear to be contrary.(a)   In the first place the establishment of compulsory day continuation schools under the Education Acts of 1918 will ultimately bring all boys and girls with whom Juvenile &apos; - Employment Committees are concerned withinthe walls of the education authority for a&apos;&quot;&quot;&quot; minimum of eight hours a week.   Any system of administering employment bureaux end comTiiveaes for juveniles that dees not make use of i;Lis new opportunity would be foolish and perverse *
(b)   In the second place however the Unemployment Insurance Act 1920 has cast upon my officers very responsible duties in connection with the payment of benefit.   The duty of safe-guarding the Insurance Fund and preventing its misuse renders it essential that my officers should exercise the closest super-ti3ion over the disbursement of benefit, and should be in a position to satisfy themselves that every recipient is genuinely unable to obtain suitable employment,I find myself therefore no more able to disclaim interest in and responsibility for the unemployed juvenile than I can for his more fortunate fellow.There is no department of my Ministry that is not concerned in some way with the entry and prospect of the juvenile in industry.   The increased interest taken by the Trade Boards and Joint Industrial Councils in juvenile questions make it impossible for me to dissociate the problems of adult and juvenile employment, and to deprive the boy and girl of the experience gained by my officers.It remains therefore to decide to whom shall be given locally a responsibility   which will be go fulfilled as to make the fullest use of the extended opportunities for education, while safe-guarding the needs of industry and insurance. Proposals.I do not find it easy to suggest to the Cabinet asolution of the problem which shall assign definitely and indetail both central and local responsibility.   I am very anxious that a permanent settlement may be speedily found,but in the search of it I am animated by the following considerations:-1.    The Minister of Labour (and previouslythe Board of Trade) has been assisted for the past ten years in this work by a body of some thousands of volunteers, who have served on Juvenile Advisory Committees and given most generously in time and thought the fruit of their experience.   In loyalty to them I cannot abandon their willing services, unless I can satisfy them that
^the whole matter, has &quot;been thoroughly explored by an impartial tribunal, and that any view? they may hold in the matter have been carefully considered,2,     The controversy is&apos;in detail too complicated and hag unfortunately become too embittered in spirit to allow of a rapid decision on the part of the Cabinet,   Only an impartial enquiry can satisfy the many interested parties that the Government has endeavoured to effect a just and permanent settlement.I therefore suggest that the Cabinet should delegatethis subject for enquiry by a member of the Cabinet hithertounconcerned with the controversy - or to a prominent publicman possessed of judicial and political experience - and thathe should be assisted by two qualified assessors appointed bythe President of the Board of Education and myself.   Evidenceshould be taken from the localities and from those who are dealing at first hand with the administrative   difficulties atpresent arising.   I further suggest that the report of suchan enquiry should be laid before the Cabinet, and that in theevent of its acceptance become binding upon the departmentsconcerned for a period of five years, at the end of whichperiod the whole question could be reviewed by the Cabineton the application of either department.T.J. KACMORA.(Minister of Labour)NoteIt will be observed that the accompanying Ivfemorandum by the President of the Board of Education was written after perusal of my own, and in criticism of its proposals.   While I am satisfied that there is a complete answer to his argument, I am unwilling to recast my memorandum, and so evoke a further reply, for the matter is urgent, and such a course would involve us in considerable delay.   I prefer to seek the guidance of the Cabinet forthwith and to suggest an impartial arbitration.

MEMORANDUM BY THE BOARD OP TRADE AND THE BOARD OF EDUCATION WITH REGARD TO CO-OPERATION BETWEEN LABOUR EXCHANGES AND LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES EXERCISING THEIR POWERS UNDER THE EDUCATION (choice of EMPLOYMENT) ACT, 1910.1. We have had under consideration (a) the Education (Choice of Employment) Act, 1910, and (6) the Special Rules with regard to Registration of Juvenile Applicants in England and Wales made on the 7th February 1910 by the Board of Trade, after consultation with the Board of Education, under the Labour Exchanges Act, 1909, and printed as an Appendix to the present Memorandum.    Under the new Act the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs, as Local Education Authorities, are empowered to make arrangements, subject to the approval of the Board of Education, for giving to boys and girls under IP years of age assistance with respect to the choice of suitable employment, by means of the collection and the communication of information and the furnishing of advice.   In the Special Rules of the Board of Trade two alternative methods are indicated by which information, advice, and assistance with respect to the choice of employment and other matters bearing thereon can be given to boys and girls and their parents in connection with the working of Labour Exchanges.  Paragraphs 2 to 5 of the Rules make provision for the establishment by the Board of Trade of Special Advisory Committees for Juvenile Employment, which may, as one of their functions, take steps to give such information, advice, and assistance, but without any responsibility with regard thereto being undertaken by the Board of Trade or the officers in charge of Labour Exchanges.   Paragraph 6 of the Special Rules contemplates the case of a Local Education Authority which has and desires to exercise statutory powers for the purposes of giving information, advice, and assistance, and provides that, where such powers are exercised in accordance with a satisfactory scheme, the registration of juvenile applicants for employment shall not be conducted by the Labour Exchange except in accordance with the scheme, and that the Board of Trade may dispense with the services of a Special Advisory Committee so far as the area of the Authority is concerned.   The enactment of the Education (Choice of Employment) Act, 1910, renders it possible for the procedure contemplated by paragraph 6 of the Special Rules to be brought into operation.2. We are of opinion that the employment of juveniles should be primarily considered from the point of view of their educational interests and permanent careers rather than from that of their immediate earning capacities, and accordingly we urge upon Local Education Authorities the desirability of undertaking, in accordance with the principles set out in the present Memorandum, the responsibilities offered to them by the new Act. We consider that it is of importance that these responsibilities should be exercised in the fullest co-operation with the national system of.Labour Exchanges established under the Labour Exchanges Act, 1909, and the Board of Education will, therefore, before approving any proposals from Local Education Authorities for the exercise of their new powers, require adequate provision to be made for such co-operation. Where a satisfactory scheme has been brought into force by a Local Education Authority, paragraph 6 of the Special Rules will operate, and the Board of Trade will be prepared to recognise a Committee of the Authority as charged with the duty of giving advice with regard, to the management of the Labour Exchange for its area in relation to juvenile applicants for employment. There are certain areas in which, pending the passing of the Act, the Board of Trade have already established, or have definitely undertaken to establish, Special Advisory Committees under paragraphs 2 to 5 of the Special Rules, and we presume that the Local Education Authorities for these areas will desire to continue the arrangements already made, at least until some further experience has been gained, and will consequently defer the exercise of their powers under the Act. So far as other areas are concerned, the Board of Trade do not propose to take any steps for the establish-ment of Special Advisory Committees until after the 31st December 1911, except inx Extended the 18 years by Section 22 of the Education Aot, 1918*
the event of the Local Education Authority passing a formal resolution to the effect that they do not propose to exercise their powers under the Choice of Employment Act.3. We recognise that the methods to be adopted by Authorities in working the Act must necessarily be subject to considerable variations in accordance with local conditions, and will, in particular, be affected by the distribution of the Labour Exchanges, the districts of which are not necessarily co-terminons with the areas of Authorities. We think, however, that in normal cases some such arrangements as are indicated in the following paragraphs are likely to be found effective in practice, and may be expected to ensure a reasonable distribution and correlation of functions between the Authorities and the Labour Exchanges.4. The work to be undertaken by public bodies in giving assistance in the choicej of employment for juveniles may be regarded as having two branches. In the first place there is the task of giving such advice to boys and girls and their parents as Avill induce them to extend where possible the period of education, and to select, when employment becomes necessary, occupations which are suited to the individual capacities of the children, and, by preference, those which afford prospects not merely of immediate wages but also of useful training and permanent employment. In the second place, there is the practical task of registering the actual applications for employment and bringing the applicants into touch with employers who have notified vacancies of the kind desired.5. In any scheme of co-operation put forward under the new Act the first of these two tasks, that of giving advice, should, we think, be assigned to the Local Education Authority, with the assistance of such information as to the conditions and pro-spects of particular kinds of employment as can be furnished by the Board of Trade through the Labour Exchanges. We think that the Authority should act through a special Sub-Committee, which may, perhaps, also be the Sub-Committee charged with the supervision of Continuation and Technical Schools, and which should always include an adequate number of members possessing experience or knowledge of industrial as well as of educational conditions. In its detailed working which should include the keeping in touch with boys and girls after as well as before employment has been found for them, such a Sub-Committee will, Ave trust, utilise to the full the services not only of teachers and of school attendance officers, but also of voluntary workers, whose activities may here find one of their most valuable educational spheres; but the work will be of a kind which depends largely upon skilled and effective organisation, and it will probably be found desirable, as a rule, to put at the disposal of the Sub-Committee an Executive Officer, who will act as its secretary, and maintain the daily contact between the Authority, the voluntary workers, and the Labour Exchange.6. As regards the second of these two tasks, namely, the registration of applications for employment and the selection of applicants to fill vacancies notified by employers, there is need for co-operation between the Education Authority and the Labour Exchange, and direct relations should be established between the Sub-Committee or officer of the Authority and the officer in charge of the Juvenile Department of the Labour Exchange. For this purpose it will probably be found convenient for the two officers to be located in the same or contiguous buildings. At present a good deal of the work done in connection with the employment of children is done at the Elementary and other schools at which the children are in attendance, and no doubt this will continue to be the case, at any rate so far as the giving of advice is concerned, but we desire to point out that the notification of applications for employment to a Central Office will increase the range of vacancies open to any one applicant, and will therefore advance the fundamental object of placing each applicant in the employment which best suits him, and to which he is best suited. We contemplate therefore that applications for employment from children still at school will continue to be received and entered upon the necessary cards by their teacher, but that the cards will then, generally speaking, be forwarded by him to the Authority&apos;s officer. The applications from boys and girls who have left school can, we think, most conveniently be registered by the officer of the Labour Exchange, but arrangements should be made to admit of such applicants being interviewed by the Authority&apos;s officer either at the time of regis-tration or as soon as possible after, as it is desirable that they should be fully advised before vacancies for employment are brought to their notice.   All applications receivedO  (11)8721.  Wt. 0018.  3000.  8/11. A 2
in either of the ways indicated should at once be made available either in original or in copies for the use both of the Education Authority and of the Labour Exchange. Notifications of vacancies for employment should be made to the officer of the Labour Exchange, who will furnish the Authority&apos;s officer with information as to each vacancy for which he proposes to submit a boy or girl, and with the name of any boy or girl whom he proposes to submit for it. Information passing between the Authority and the Labour Exchange will naturally be held to be strictly for the purposes of their co-operation. We anticipate that in ordinary cases the question whether a particular vacancy is suitable for a particular boy or girl will give rise to no difference of opinion between the two officers. It will, however, probably be necessary to provide for the possibility of a difference of opinion. We think, therefore, that as a rule the decision should rest with the Authority&apos;s representative as regards any child who is still in attendance at an elementary or other clay school or has not left the day school more than six. months previously, and that as regards applicants who have passed this limit, the decision should rest with the officer of the Labour Exchange who will however consult the Authority^ representative in all cases in which this is practicable, and will in all cases inform him as to the manner in which each vacancy is ultimately filled.7. Should any scheme be submitted for the approval of the Board of Education under the Act in which it is proposed to vary these limits or otherwise to depart materially from the scheme of co-operation outlined in this memorandum, it should be accompanied by a full statement of the special reasons urged by the Local Education Authority in support of the proposed variation. The special circumstances of the case will then be considered jointly by the two Departments.(Signed)     SYDNEY BUXTON, 3rd January 1911.
