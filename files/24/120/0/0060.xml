Copy No.... sv... ------CABINET,CP. 2660.REPORT BY THE GENERAL OFFICER COIMNDING*-IN*ImJ^&quot;W&apos;T!IE^ ii^ioo^; mum ranmr&apos;(Circulated by the Secretary of State for War.)1. GENERAL SITUATION.The past week has been comparatively quiet though there is no reason to anticipate that the lull will continue.The most Important engagementc to he recorded between the Crown Forces and ^the rebels are(a) The attack at Middleton on the 20th. inst. by a party of tho 2nd. Hampshire Rogt. oh 21 armed rebels, 13 of whom were killed   -and the remaining 8 captured.(b) Tjie attack at Kilkenny on tho 21st. inst, on a ration escort in which two rebels were killed and 1 oaptured.These two encounters were referred to In last week!s report.(c) The engagement on the 25th. between a party of 70 auxiliaries and a party of rebels between Ballyvoumey and Macroom in which Major Grant commanding the Auxiliaries was killed and 8 men were wounded.    A party of 20 of the Royal Fusiliers sent out from Killarney came on the scene, pursued the retreating enemy, inflicted some casualties on him and captured one wounded man.The shooting in cold blood of unarmed soldiers, who have had the misfortune to fall into their hands, is a new phase of activity on the part of the rebels, three men of the Ox. &amp; Bucks L.I. having been found murdered at tfoodford near Limerick on the 22nd Febi after being missing for 9 days, and two men of the Essex Regt, who were kidnapped at Bandon on the 23rd Febj being subsequently shot,Hews&apos;has also jast been received of the shooting of several unarmed soldiers in the streets of C0rk on the evening of the 28th, five of them boing killed and seven wounded.    This is doubtless an outcome of the feeling produced by the execution at Cork ihe same morning of 6 rebels-, 6 of whom had been convicted of treason and one of carrying arms.The forthcoming institution of the new form of Government in the north of Iretind will make it advisable to form the 6 counties which will come under that Government into a Separate Brigade Areae    In anticipation of this,change the Counties of Sligo and Northern part of Leitrin! have been transferred from the Londonderry Brigade Area of the 1st. Division to the 13th, Brigade Area of the 5th. Division,    The 1st. Beds. &amp; Herts. R0gt.  which was quartered at Finner Camp &amp; Sllgo has also been transferred from the 1st, to the 5th. Division.
