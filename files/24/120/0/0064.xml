Bombay.-Student situation improved iu whole Presidency, reaction having set in. Many students returning. Chotani asked leading Nationalists to advise him before his departure for England. There will probably be further intensive campaign to strengthen him at Allied Conference. Debate in Legislative Assembly on Punjab disorders, following on appeal of Duke, has lad good effect. His Royal Highness had great reception in Bombay, though Hartal had been organised previously. One market decided to close and 300 private chauffeurs arranged to strike. Separate report of reception sent. Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway workmen still on strike. Dockers and labourers of Port Trust Railways showing signs of restlessness.2. At mass meeting tramway workers resolution passed declaring that, in order to obtain recognition of duly constituted union, men, if necessary, would declare a general strike.3. Bengal. Situation in schools and colleges not materially altered, but showing signs of improvement in Dacca Division, where majority of institutions have re-opened, and are being fairly well attended. According to Press, improvement extended to Calcutta. Attendance at the few national schools established, poor. Significant development is au organisation styled &quot; Bangya Swaraj Sevak Sangha,&quot; in which student volunteers are gathering round a nucleus of ex-detenus. Non-co-operation movement largely engaged in arguing its case and in discussions of campaign. Meetings of working committees of All-India Congress Committee held first week in February. Supervising and organising members appointed for each Province. Staff of schools and colleges opened as national schools directed to follow new curriculum, and to aim at its full enforcement by end of current year, meanwhile to confine attention to handspinning and cottage manufacture of yarns : to teaching Hindustani through the Devanagri and Urdu scripts, and to training students in arts requisite for efficient discharge of work of village organisation. Gandhi&apos;s power with illiterate classes increasing and illustrated by rumours that fall in price of ghee and cloth due to his action. Bodies of strikers visited Calcutta and paid him a rupee each and promised to touch no wine again during their lifetime. Deputation of reserve constables were told by him they were servants of public, whom they should not inconvenience, and should weigh everything in balance before they decide to give up service.4. In course of strike, strikers attacked trams driven by Anglo-Indians leaving the Kalighat Depot on 18th, and tried to rush depot; police force, under Deputy Commissioner, proceeded to their protection. Pushed by mob, sergeants under orders fired revolvers in air. Prison van being sent with reinforcements attacked; colour sergeant in charge alleged to have fired his revolver, killing one man and wounding three.   Magisterial enquiry being made.United Provinces. No further disturbances in Rae Bareilly and Fyzabad. Four more agitators have been arrested under sections 124a and 1.53a, in three cases for seditious speeches, and in the fourth case for speeches attempting to seduce the police from duty. As to strike on Oudh and Rohilkund Railway reported last week, latest news is, that running staff have nearly all returned to work and a considerable number of men to locomotive shops. Office staff has also returned. Situation well in hand, though strike cannot yet be said to have failed.5. It has been decided that magistrates in remaining seven districts of Oudh should prohibit meetings under section 44, Code of Criminal Procedure. They will exercise full discretion in allowing special meetings. A mixed column of all arms marching through Fyzabad and Sultanpur in order to show the flag. The itinerary provides for a march of about 10 days. Position in Fyzabad somewhat peculiar. No-reports of crime are being made in pursuance of present policy of the Kisam Sabhas to decide all disputes by Panchayats. Few cases instituted in civil courts. Unrest among students prominent both in Lucknow and Benares, and continues elsewhere. Signs are reported of welcome activity in opposition to prevailing agitation. In 3457     100  3.21
Bndaun district local zamindars organised an opposition meeting against a large meeting at which prominent Nationalist leaders were expected, which completely swamped Nationalists&apos; meeting. Commissioner reports that local zarnindars handled situation well, Commissioner of Benares writes that position is better, and that tone of people is one of effort by the people to do something for themselves rather than against Government.Central Provinces. Non-co-operation agitation shows no signs of abatement. Poison spreading to large villages. Owing to the knowledge that Local Government has decided on policy of prosecution of more violent speakers, tone of speeches more restrained, but same gospel of non-co-operation preached. More sober-minded section of people recognise seriousness of situation. Some cases have occurred of difficulty in Government servants obtaining supplies on tour and social boycott continues to be practised. Great activity shown in the attacks on colleges and schools.Movement is gradually spreading throughout Province, and though attendance at high schools varies from 50 to 84 per cent., it is slowly-xlecreasing. About 33 lawyers have withdrawn from practice in order to devote themselves to cause of non-co-operation.6. Under section 124a, Dr. M. It. Cholkar, private medical practitioner and Vice-President, Nagpur Municipality, been arrested to-day. lie was produced before District Magistrate, and taken to Central Jail amidst shouts of 33andernataram. Case will be heard on 3rd March.7. Punjab. No marked development in non-co-operation. Owing to operation of Seditious Meetings Act, meetings only possible in certain districts, but these are dangerous because they may result in the creation of disaffection in the minds of persons who came in contact with propaganda for first time. Non-co-operative Panehayats are set up in different villages with object of boycotting Executive authority. Students and hired preachers sent out from Lahore to further the non-co-operation movement, it is expected they will be employed next to incite Zamindars to refuse payment of land revenue. On the other hand, Commissioner, Lahore, reports that he met some of the students who Lad attended Gujrauwalla meetings, and that none of them thought that he was obliged to stir up people not to pay land revenue. La j pat Kai reported to be organising meetings and to be arranging for funds. Pleader class do not support the uon-coperation movement whole-hearted by giving up legal practice, and a good deal of disgust among the leaders. Sardar Sardal &apos;Singh. President of District Sikh League and Secretary of Provincial Congress Committee, been served with order under section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure, not to leave limits of Lahore Municipality. As regards Akhali Dal movement to take possession of Sikh shrines, it had been proposed to hold a preliminary conference of Neo-Sikhs and of Mohants and Pujaris in possession of the shrines, with object of settling upon points in dispute. Since then, however, the affair at Nankana Sahib, which is being separately reported, has occurred, and it is possible that this may necessitate the abandonment of this proposal and the adoption of other measures.8. Delhi. The outstanding event has been the Royal visit. Functions passed off successfully and the effect of the visit has been good with the better classes of population and troops collected in Delhi for the occasion. No untoward incidents or any obstruction attempted. Attendance of general public on the routes meagre, but it must be remembered that processions arranged did not lend themselves to great spectacular displays. Hartal advertised for the 9th February, but half-hearted affair as far as the shopkeepers were concerned. People could buy what they wanted at side doors. The partial Hartal of 14th&apos;affected no one. Gandhi opened Tibbia College on the 13th. The ceremony included unveiling portraits of Lord and Lady Hardinge. Oandhi&apos;9 address carefully avoided politics.9. Schools and colleges in Delhi appear so far to have been singularly little affected by intensive propaganda in other large cities.North-West Frontier Province. Partial recrudescence of political agitation. Lajpat Rai&apos;s visit to Rawalpindi, and promise to extend tour to Peshawar, signal for political meetings in Peshawar. His exclusion from Province disappointed local agitators, and meetings of protest held, Decided to form Provincial Congress Committees, and District Committees already established in Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan. Meetings held to advocate non-co-operation, and appeal made to schools.
oBurma-Signs of increasing cleavage between two parties inside Young Men&apos;s &quot;Buddhist Association. In debate in Legislative Council one member assured. Government of co-operation if dyarcby on literal (?liberal) lines adopted; on tho other hand, two priests and various laymen touring country and delivering violent, speeches. Prosecution of one priest sanctioned. Educational boycott remains about, the same. No signs of financial support in cash to national, schools movement, and. the teachers in one of the national schools- are on strike because they cannot get their pay.Madras.--Leaders (? of omitted) non-co-operation movement redoubled efforts to win recruits (?for omitted) organisation known as Swarji Volunteer Corps, started by local Khilafat, Committee for propaganda work, bur, only 25 joined up to present, -Campaign amongst students pressed, but results incommensurate with activities displayed. In Mofussil, efforts of leaders met with little success, except in Malabar. Attempts made to secure Mopiljas caused some concern, and local leaders called in Yakub Hasan and others.10. District Magistrate of Calicut issued orders prohibiting Khilafat meetings, and arrested Yakub Hasan and three others, who were ordered to execute security of Rs. 1,000 each, and on refusing to execute bonds, to six months&apos; imprisonment. Hartal in the City of Madras, but Local Government reports that, while incidents caused some local excitement, and large crowds collected, which were dispersed by police on each occasion without great difficulty and without use of firearms, situation well in hand, and shops have now opened.   Business proceeding as usual.   Motion, raised in Legislative Council, but talked out without division, sense of House strongly supporting action of District Magistrate.   Presidency Khilafat Committee resolved arrangements should be made for complete Hartal throughout the Presidency, to. express resentment of people at action District Magistrate, Calicut.   Chairman, Calicut Municipality, resigned as protest.   Yakub Hasan has had statement published in Hindu to effect that District Magistrate order disobeyed, so as to impress on people non-violent character of non-co-operation programme.   If 20,000 people assembled at meeting and went back disappointed, they would have carried disaffection far wider.   Moreover, if District Magistrate succeeded in enforcing order, all activities would be suppressed throughout India, which he cannot allow.   A Vakils meeting in Mahajana Sabha resolved to start Arbitration Courts from 1st March.   In Bihar a number of constables resigned in Patna and Gaya.   Understood to be due to-the efforts of agitators, and constables were interviewed and asked to withdraw resignations, as they did not understand position.   At Gaya all constables who resigned except 37 withdrew resignations and resumed duty.   No movement whatever amongst constables of Patna, who realise that the Gaya movement has failed.   Situation in this respect has much improved.   Renewed attack upon schools and colleges has not met with much success, and most of students who have left have returned.   Press message states District Magistrate, Arrah, served notice on Mazarul Ilaque and RajendraPrasad forbidding them to enter proscribed limits of town under section 1-14, Criminal Procedure Code.   Assam.  School campaign had but little real success.   A large Khilafat meeting presided over by Chanda fell rather flat.t1:1. General. On the whole there are some signs of improvement. Attack on educational institutions has apparently suffered and (sic? a) checked (-sic? check). Gandhi appears to be realising danger of tampering with masses, and has written article in which he declares that it is dangerous to make political use of factory labourers or peasantry. 1 low far his advice on this point will be accepted by his followers remains to be seen ; but fact that he is not inclined to lend his assistance to agitators who are endeavouring to stir up masses, undoubtedly reduces the danger of this side of the non-co-operation movement securing any great measure of success. At the same time, situation in. this country is liable to change with great rapidity, -and it would be unwise to base any confident inferences on what may prove to be merely temporary improvement. Our relations with Indian Legislature are at present excellent, and this is having a distinct effect on country.
