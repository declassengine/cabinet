Q OGENERAL.Very little change in the general position has taken place during the past week. Diminished activity is reported in the iron and steel industries, and large numbers of men connected with these industries are unemployed in Yorkshire and also in Wales. Unemployment is also increasing in the shipbuilding yards, and it is stated that there is a scarcity of new work. Ship-repair work is, however, still fairly brisk in certain ports. The depression in the cotton industry is becoming more pronounced, and it is reported that manufacturers are still unable to dispose of their heavy stocks, even at a considerable loss, The trade union funds in this industry are rapidly becoming depleted. In the lace trade employers are of the opinion that a considerable improvement will take place in the near future, and it is also reported that in the hosiery trade orders for the home market are more numerous, but no substantial improvement^movement^in Jthe trade generally may be expected until the export trade revives. The position in the woollen and worsted industries remains unchanged, but the slight improvement previously reported in the boot and shoe trade is being maintained. In the Midlands unemployment is still severe in the engineering and metal trades, but workpeople connected with the pottery and carpet industries are stated to be on full time. The general position in London remains acute, Dock and transport work is still slack, but hopes are entertained of an expansion of business with South America in the near future.II. EMERGENCY WORK.The Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons on the 19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. He outlined schemes for employing a large number of fit ex-Service men in connection with the Housing Programme, on which negotiations with the trade unions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme for Arterial Roads in London and in the provinces; whilst at the same time pressing forward with the Ministry of Transports programme of road classification and maintenance grants.A further statement was made by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December, indicating that the further proposals of the Government included: a final endeavour to secure an agreement with the building trades for the admission of ex-Service men; a rapid extension of road construction schemes; the distribution by the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Viscount St. Davids, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting local authorities on relief schemes other than house building and road work; and the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit. It has since been agreed that the Unemployment Grants Committee shall also deal with schemes in respect of road work other than those undertaken by the Ministry of Transport.ROAD WORK PROGRAMME.
