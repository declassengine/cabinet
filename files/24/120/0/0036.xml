THE CABINET BV THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.With reference to Conclusion 2 of Cabinet 4 held on the 28th January, I circulate for the information of the Cabinet tbe appended Memorandum by the High Commissioner for India.It will be observed that the High Commissioner does not propose to carry out the Cabinet decision, although lie describes a practice which does go some way, at any rate, to meet the objects the Cabinet had in view. I would remind the Cabinet that he spends the Indian tax-payers&apos; money and not the British tax-payers&apos;, and that ultimately questions which involve expenditure from Indian revenues cannot be decided by the Cabinet, but by statute only by a majority of the Council of India.The High Commissioner is only technically accurate in saying that he is not bound by the decision of the Cabinet, for although he is acting under the orders of the Government of India, the Secretary of State can issue orders to the Government of India, subject only to the control of the Council of India over expenditure. But I would propose to leave the matter as described by the High Commissioner in his Memorandum.Memorandum by Sir William Meyer, High Commissioner for India,18th February 1921.As regards the question of King&apos;s National Roll firms and Government contracts, I may say that soon after assuming charge of my present post .1 spontaneously initiated a system under which, in the case of competing tenders, preference was given to a firm on the King&apos;s Roll, if, though that firm had not made the lowest tender, it was fairly close to a tender by a non-King&apos;s Roll firm. Sometimes, too, a non-King&apos;s Roll firm was asked, before deciding to eliminate it in favour of a Kings&apos; Roll firm which, had offered at slightly higher rates, whether it was prepared to come on to the Kings Roll.2. I do not consider that the system proposed by the Cabinet Order of 28th January which I do not think I am obliged to adopt as High Commissioner since I am under the orders of the Government of India  is a good one. I share the views expressed by the Admiralty and the Air Ministry in criticism thereof, that it infringes on the sound doctrine that tenders should be regarded as absolutely private, and if you com-municate A&apos;s tender to B in order to try to induce B to bring down his price, you will end by getting A, B and the rest to combine in forming a ring. A Committee on which I once sat in India, as regards the Stationery&apos; Department there, found that this was exactly what had occurred by reason of a well-intentioned attempt on the part of the Bengal Board of Revenue to distribute business evenly among tbe local paper mills by suggesting to X that they might come down to Y&apos;s tender. The final result was that the mills, seeing that this principle was being applied, met it by adopting uniform high prices.3. In the case of tenders by German firms I have, I may say, adopted on occasion the system of telling a British firm of a lower German tender and asking the Britisher if they would come down. But that is a very exceptional case justified by political reasons. It ought not to be a pplied as between British firms themselves.4. I propose, therefore, to continue my system explained in para. 1.23rd February 1921.E. S. M.3430     100  2.21
