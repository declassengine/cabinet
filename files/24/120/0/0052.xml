Mesopotamia.0/184/106.General Headquarters, Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force.The Secretary,War Office, London.Sir,        Baghdad, November 25,1920.IN reply to your 86419 M.0.4, of the 30th September, I have the honour to submit the following report on the work of the Royal Air Force during the recent operations.At the commencement of the operation! in July, the establishment of the Royal Air Force in Mesopotamia was three squadrons, of which two were in the country and the third forming in Egypt. Of the two squadrons in Mesopotamia, one flight was, and still remains, detached at Kasvin, in North-West Persia, and one was at Bushire, whence it was later with-drawn, on the understanding that, in the event of emergency, aeroplanes could be sent to Bushire from Shaibah at short notice. The remaining flights were at Baghdad, with one detached at Mosul. At that time the Royal Air Force was in process of being equipped with D.H.9a and Bristol Fighter aeroplanes, and very heavy work fell on the Aircraft Park, of
The functions which the Royal Air Force have been called upon to perform are: (i.) Reconnaissance, (ii.) Tactical co-operation with troops, (iii.) Communication, (iv.) Distant attacks. , (v.) Demonstrations.Reconnaissance.The greater part of the work done by aeroplanes during the operations has taken the form of reconnaissances com-bined with attacks on concentrations, camps, and strongholds of the insurgents. These reconnaissances by aeroplanes have been of special value to columns engaged in operations, since, owing to the liability of Mesopotamia to frequent topo-graphical changes, alterations natural and artificial in the courses of roads and irrigation channels occur and large areas become flooded, thereby rendering inaccurate maps of even recent date, tylueh reconnaissance work has beenThe G.O.C., Mesopotamia, justly draws attention to the fact that the Air Force in Mesopotamia was of extremely limited strength, that the rising came while squadrons were in process of being re-equipped with modern machines, and that the personnel suffered much from malaria and sand-fly, due largely to the absence of proper living accommodation. Under these circumstances, it is of the happiest augury for the future that so much was effected.In the notes below the headings of the Gr.O.C.&apos;s report are followed.which the personnel were considerably under strength and the great majority young and untrained.The aeroplanes as received were not supplied with special tropical radiators, which are necessary to enable them to be used with safety in the blaze of the hot weather sun, when the temperature of the air reaches normally 1150 in the day, and may rise to a height approaching 1300. Improvised radiators had to be fitted and many experiments carried out to attain the satisfactory results which were reached before the arrival of the tropical radiators removed this great difficulty. Another cause of heavy work was the effect on the material of the planes and engines of hot weather conditionsIn any criticism of the work of thp Royal Air Force during this summer the above facts must receive due considera-tion.As regards the officers and personnel of the Royal Air Force, I wish to preface my report with an acknowledgment of their devotion to duty and great efforts in a trying climate and in spite of the heavy incidence of malaria and sand-fly fever.
carried out with the object of ascertaining the condition of railways, which were known to have suffered damage at the hands of the insurgents, and the detailed information submitted by the Royal Air Force has been of material assistance in the preparation of plans. By means of the photographs and reports received from this source, the approaches to objectives have been defined and plans of action simplified.. In the Mosul area, this work has involved frequent flights over the hills of Kurdistan, and as these hills are usually covered with rocks, trees, and scrub, and afford excellent cover from view, observa-tion has proved to be exceedingly difficult by aeroplanes at high altitudes. The majority of the villages in this district are situated in deep, narrow, and thickly wooded valleys, whose sides are so ate; as to bathe the inhabited area and its surroundings, as well as all tracks in the vicinity, in deep shadow. Observation and bombing render it necessary that machines should fly at a low altitude, a procedure which, in a rugged and hilly country, is both undesirable and may be disastrous.The only available maps of Kurdistan, beyond our outposts, are very inaccurate, and, by their aid alone, it is almost impos-sible to locate a village. The buildings have flat roofs, overgrown with vegeta tion, which render them on many occa sions invisible from above. Moreover, the absence in Kurdistan of railways and roads, and the fact that woods and rivers have not yet been surveyed in detail, deprive the aviator of the guides to which he is accustomed in civilised regions, and add to the difficulty of his task.Another point which must not be over The great value of the Air Force in the looked is that the inhabitants of this pursuit of a beaten enemy has been once country, and more especially those who more proved in Mesopotamia : with a have experienced the visits of aeroplanes, greater strength of Air Forces available, have realised the possibilities and advan- aircraft should of themselves effect the tages of concealing themselves and their enemy&apos;s defeat. It is admitted that the flocks before the arrival of the machines Air Force has at times failed to dislodge within bombing range. On the other the enemy from his chosen position. Such hand, leconnaissance work over the attacks have often been carried out in deserts of Northern Mesopotamia does insufficient force, but in any case it is not present the same difficulties as those unreasonable to expect an enemy to leave ref erred to above, but even in the desert the his trenches while he is actually being ground is much cut up by watercourses bombed and exchange his position for one and hillocks, amongst which hostile still less safe. The assumption of the Air parties can conceal themselves, while the Force is that if he is attacked by numbers absence of landmarks is an ever present of aircraft and subjected to a long difficulty. The nomadic character of the bombardment he will take advantage of Bedouin also makes identification by the night to disappear from the danger maps very difficult. &quot; Villages&quot; are point. If he does not, the attack must be occupied at one time and appear as ruins  renewed the following day in still greater

Many villages shown on map,;   strength, and it will be impossible for anyin desert areas do not exist, and others   enemy to offer continuous resistance.have been permanently deserted, whilewatercourses, which appear as rivers, arefrequently quite dry in hot weather.  Itmay here be mentioned that in LowerMesopotamia and along the course of theEuphrates   the   numerous   irrigationchannels and the palm groves on the riverbanks make concealment easy. Reconnaissance.Observation is also made difficult by It has long been recognised that atmospheric conditions, such as sand- negative reports from aircraft reconnais-storms and &quot;bumpy&quot; air, especially in sance must not be entirely relied upon, the hot weather, and perhaps others which Increasing experience of the habits of the are not yet fully understood. For enemy and better maps will, however, instance, on some occasions aeroplanes improve the results obtained, and with have been over ground where raiding more aircraft available, &quot; semi-continu-bands have been known to be moving, but ous&apos;&apos; as opposed to &quot;fleeting &quot; reconnais-have seen nothing. It has even occurred sance will add to the accuracy of reports, that observers in aeroplanes have passed It is interesting to observe that these over the camps of a large section of Arabs, reconnaissances have in the face of all comprising hundreds of black tents and difficulties proved &quot;of great value to the thousands of cattle and other animals, Army.&quot; without seeing anything unusual, although they were specially looking for this section.The foregoing remarks have referred mainly to long distance and independent reconnaissances. The value of aeroplanes has also been demonstrated in reconnais-sances in close co-operation with columns operating against the insurgents; but here again the limitations imposed on aerial observation have been demon-demonstrated. On more than one occasion messages have been dropped on a column, reporting no concentrations or hostile bodies in the neighbourhood, at a time when the artillery of the column were actually preparing to open fire upon bodies of insurgents visible from the ground. In spite, however, of the limita-tions to which I have drawn attention, there remains the fact that the assistance of aeroplanes in reconnaissances, both long distance and in close co-operation with troops, has proved of great value to the Army.Tactical Co-operation.The tactical co-operation of aeroplanes with troops is comprised in (i.) Reconnaissance (to which reference has already been made), (ii.) Co-operation during the fight by (a) Bombing and machine gun-ning;(b) Observation of artillery fire;(c) Watching for and dealing withflank attacks and enemy rein-forcements; and(d) Pursuit.
The principal limitation in all these, apart from the difficulties of observation, lies in the brief time during which aeroplanes can remain with the column with which they are co-operating. Landing grounds exist at few places, far apart, and the limit of air endurance of aeroplanes necessitates their returning -for more petrol after a comparatively short time spent in active co-operation. It is, therefore, difficult to arrange for machines to be present at the actual oimes when their services would be most useful. On those occasions when plans for attack could be made, to take place at a definite fixed time, the close co-operation of aeroplanes has proved of great value. This was especially the case in the operations leading to the occupation of Deltawah and of Tuwairij on the 24th September and the 12th Octo-ber respectively. On these occasions, with definite objectives, the times at which attacks would be made could be precisely foretold, and aeroplanes, arriving at the right moment, were able, by means of bombs and machine-gun fire, to assist greatly in the defeat of the insurgents. &quot;Usually, however, the advance commences without definite knowledge of the position at which the principal opposition will be met, and the aeroplanes sent to co-operate with the column are compelled, unless they happen to arrive at the time that the attack is in progress, to limit their action to reconnoitring the country in the neigh-bourhood of the column and making their reports before having to return to their base. The same reasons render it difficult to give assistance to the artillery by the observation of the fire of guns. Tele-graphic communications with columns moving through the country cannot be kept up with a degree of efficiency which will allow of telegrams to call machines from their base to the assistance of a column at short notice.Far greater value could have been obtained from aeroplanes had there been greater possibilities of using wireless telegraphy, which would have overcome most of the difficulties mentioned. The number of wireless personnel in the Force have been extremely small, and they have been.used to the utmost extent possible, but it is essential that every column and every detachment should have an effective wireless set, and that communication with Formation Head-quarters should thus be ensured to enableTactical Co-operation.The importance of radius of action ani air endurance has been continually urged on the General Staff by the Air Staff, and they are glad to see that their view is confirmed by the G.O.C.-in-C, Mesopo-tamia.There has been no lack of recognition by the Air Force of the value of wireless telegraphy, and it is a fact that the Air Force personnel and equipment have had to take over the responsibility for this form of communication almost through-out Mesopotamia owing to deficiency in the resources of the Army in this respect.
Communications.The G.O.C.-in-C. pays tribute to the value of the Air Force in communications with distant columns and isolated garri-sons, in carrying commanders and staff officers to points where their presence is needed, and in rescuing political officers. He is more doubtful about supply by air, but it must be remembered that he had very few aircraft available and that these were not of a weight-carrying type. There are in existence in the Air Force aeroplanes of such capacity that a mountain gun complete with crew and ammunition can be carried by two of them to reinforce a post, while a single machine can transport 2,000 lb. of food or ammuni-tion to a distance of 200 miles and return without landing. Practice in dropping these supplies will lead to increased accuracy being attained.calls for aeroplanes to be made at the time when they are required, and to allow of better communication between aeroplanes and the ground.In addition to co-operating by observing artillery fire and by bombing and machine-gunning the enemy, aeroplanes can also assist in watching the flanks and dealing with preparations, for a flank attack on the part of the enemy and reporting the approach of reinforcements. Effective-ness on these occasions depends also on the aeroplanes arriving at the right moment.The realisation that the fact of no concentrations having been observed by aeroplanes does not absolutely prove that such concentrations do not exist, prevents the complete removal from the mind of the commander of all the anxiety with regard to his flanks.Pursuit.After the successful issue of the flight, aeroplanes have more than once been able to complete the rout of the retiring insurgents and pursue them to a distance quite impossible for troops. On the occasion of the advance of Brigadier-General Coningham&apos;s column to the relief of Rurnaithah, and also immediately after the occupation of Tuwairij, aero-planes overtook bodies of insurgents, either retiring, or assembling under cover from the column, and were able by means of bombs and machine-gun fire to scatter and pursue them to a distance of from ten to fifteen miles, thereby removing the chance of further opposition on the part of the Arabs.Communication. The work of communication includes (a.) Communication    with    distantcolumns and isolated garrisons. (&amp;.) Inter - communication    between columns operating in conjunctionwith each other. (c.) Transporting food and materials,and ferrying commanders, staff officers and others.(a.) It has proved difficult to maintain communication by wire with columns operating at a distance, either owing to the difficulty of laying the cable or repairing telegraph lines with sufficient rapidity to keep up with the movement of the column or owing to the cutting of wires behind the column, or with garrisons that have been invested or
localities with which communication has been interrupted by insurgent action. The great shortage of wireless personnel lias prevented these difficulties from being overcome by wireless telegraphy. In all these cases the value of aeroplanes has been great.As an example, when the troops from Diwaniyah, whose communication by rail and telegraph had been interrupted, were moving towards Hillah, aeroplanes enabled messages and instructions to be conveyed to the Column Headquarters, and reports on the position and progress of the column itself to be obtained.Communication with the garrisons of Kufah and Samawah was maintained by this means throughout the time that these posts wrere beleaguered. In Kufah, owing to the impossibility of landing, communication had to be limited to such messages ,as could be transmitted on the Popham panel and to dropping messages to the garrison, while information was obtained by asking for definite signals to answer &apos;&apos; Yes &quot; or &quot; No &quot; to questions asked.At Samawah, until the camp was closely invested, aeroplanes were able.to land and convey messages and passengers such as expert wireless personnel for the repair of the wireless set. When the investment became closer, the landing of aeroplanes became impossible, and in any case of this sort, unless an area with a radius of not less than a mile and a-half can be securely held by the troops of the garrison, the landing of aeroplanes must be dangerous. Even in flying low enough to drop messages at Kufah and Samawah, almost all of the machines were hit by rifle fire, and a considerable proportion rendered ineffective by its results.(b.) Aeroplanes afford a means of inter-communication between columns on the move, which otherwise is difficult to arrange. The limitation imposed on the messages that can be interchanged by the inability of aeroplanes to land except at prepared landing grounds necessitates careful arrangements for codes and signals between aeroplanes and the ground. However, the location of columns and their progress can be seen, &apos; and information thus obtained is always of value.(c.) At Rumaithah particularly, and also in the case of the defence vessel &quot;Greenfly,&quot; and in lesser degrees at Samawah and Kufah, aeroplanes were of great use in conveying either food, supplies, spare parts of machine guns,
wireless apparatus, and even on one occasion, the breech block of a 13-pounder gun.With regard to food supply, the amount an aeroplane can carry compared with that needed by a garrison is so inconsider-able that only in the case of posts held by a small number can the aeroplanes main-tain the food supply for any length of time. The difficulty of dropping articles in a small confined space also must lead to a proportion not reaching the garrison; and aeroplanes which fly low enough to drop parcels accurately run very con-siderable risk of being shot down. This was exemplified in the case of the attempts to feed the defence vessel &quot;Greenfly&apos;&apos; near Khidr on the Euphrates when it was aground and cut off from communication. Only a small propor-tion of the supplies dropped actually reached the crew, and almost every machine that was engaged in this series of operations was hit, in many cases seriously, and in one with the result that the machine was brought down in the river, and the pilot and observer were captured and murdered.In addition to carrying material, aeroplanes have been of frequent use in ferrying officers and others, carrying commanders rapidly to various parts of the areas under their control, staff officers to reconnoitre, and in some cases for the removal of Polftical Officers from places where their lives have become endangered by the threat of an early outbreak amongst the local tribes.Distant A attack.The difficulty of striking at concen-trations or important centres of the insurrection at distances out of range of troops by land or in impenetrable country has been overcome on more than one occasion, and with considerable effect by bombing and machine gun attack by aeroplanes. Large concentrations which offer good targets can in this way some-times be dispersed, with the result of completely upsetting the plans of the insurgent leaders. The difficulty of observation, which has been mentioned before, affects this action also, as in many parts of Mesopotamia, especially in the palm groves on the borders of the rivers, considerable numbers of insurgents can concentrate and hide themselves from observation from the air.Distant A attack.Even with the limited strength in the country, aircraft have succeeded in creating considerable effect by attacking concentrations out of range from or inpeiietrable to troops. The Air Staff is informed that the towns of Umm-el-Barur, Abu Sukhair and Saarah (all noted insurgent centres) surrendered as a result of bombing alone. It is certain that villages liable to this attack are evacuated by day : with more aircraft available and by the use of large delay action bombs they can be made un-approachable by night. Improved &apos;&apos; man-killing &apos;&apos; bombs will increase the effective -ness of air attack on tribesmen in the field, as opposed to disaffected villages.
Conclusion.In conclusion, I wish to point out that aeroplanes as an auxiliary to troops on the ground are of great value, but I do not consider that as a primary force they have the qualities which will enable them without the assistance of land forces to bring into subjection tribes who have committed themselves to insurrection. In this view I am aware that the Royal Air Force do not concur.For close and successful co-operation between land and air forces, it is essential that the Royal Air Force be kept fully and constantly informed of the progress of events, of the plans of commanders,Demonstrations.This is the most significant paragraph of the.G.O.C.-in-C. Mesopotamia&apos;s report by reason of the statement that delicate situations which could not be dealt with by troops have been at least temporarily stabilised by aircraft demonstrations : in the case quoted an outbreak was con-stantly anticipated but never materialised owing to the visits of aircraft. This is a striking confirmation of the Air Staff view, and as the power of aircraft is mor frequently demonstrated and respect for that power becomes more securely rooted in the minds of the people, the efficacy of these demonstrations will be increased. With greater strength in air squadrons in the country it should be possible to stabilise in this manner a situation in any district: the delay which the use of ground troops involves merely permits the outbreak to go unchecked until unrest develops into insurrection.conclusion the two points in this respect on which the Air Stall desire to lay emphasis are : (a.) The confirmation of the power of aircraft to stabilise a situation by demonstrations.(&amp;.) The recognition of the fact that bombing carried out in strength and properly sustained has of itself brought about the submission-sion of tribes.The G.O.C.-in-C, while admitting these f acts,adheres to his opinion that Air Units effect less than ground troops. In the case in question this is doubtless the truth, but no one would claim that two to three squadrons of the Royal Air Force, whose time is largely taken up with Army co-operation, can show independent results comparable to those obtained by three to four divisions composed of infantry, cavalry and guns, with aircraft to back them. But the operations of these large military forces, although ultimately successful, entail enormous expenditure of money and considerable sacrifice of life : the Air Staff point to what has actually been achieved under great difficulties by exiguous Air Forces as direct confirma-. tion of their expressed belief in the power of the Air to control a country of this kind economically without the use of large military columns1.Demonstrations.It has occurred in areas where the situation has grown delicate and proba-bilities of an early rising have been seen which could not be dealt with by troops at the time that the situation has been at least temporarily stabilised by the use of aeroplanes to demonstrate over the affected area. From this it has frequently resulted that waverers have been impelled to refuse to throw in their lot with those who were trying to initiate a rising. This was particularly the case in the G-harraf area, where an outbreak was constantly anticipated, but was postponed from time to time after aeroplanes had been sent to demonstrate over the country.
2. Note by Deputy Chief of Imperial General Staff.B.M., D. 11/515 (D.C.I.G.S.).Chief of the Air Staff, Air Ministry.War Office, London, S.W., February 16,1921.The General Staff fully endorse the conclusion arrived at by General Haldane (page 9) as to the great, value of aeroplanes throughout the operations, but they wish to emphasise the fact that it is as an auxiliary to troops on the ground that their value has been shown. They entirely agree, with the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in con-sidering that for the present, while they are an essential adjunct to military operations, aircraft cannot to any great extent replace troops as the permanent controlling force in the government of the country.The General Staff further consider that for the close and successful co-operation between land and air forces, on which General Haldane rightly lays such stress, it is essential that every Military Commander to whom units of the Royal Air Force are allotted should have on his staff an officer of the Royal Air Force fully qualified by training and experience to advise him as to the employ-ment of aircraft in operations, and in ail matters connected with their maintenance and the well-being of their personnel.Note by the Chief of the Air Staff.I am unable to agree with the remarks of the General Staff. With the exception of the Sulimaniyah rising, which was dealt with by the combined force of all arms at very great expense in June 1919, the use of troops as punitive columns in the hilly portions of the Mosul division and in Kurdistan appears from all reports to have been unsatisfactory. It would seem that we usually failed to attain our object, which was the punishment of those responsible, and I do not consider there is any prospect of our being able to do so more successfully in the future except by the use of local levies supported by Air.Extracts are appended from two other reports received from the Middle East, which support my conviction that the Royal Air Force in sufficient strength and correctly used will undoubtedly, with the assistance of local levies, be able to undertake a great deal of the work which in the past has been done by the Army.This can only be proved if it is tried, but I consider that the Royal Air Force have shown in Mesopotamia that they are in a position without assistance from other arms to lend adequate support to local levies in the maintenance of order, and that a sufficient force of the Royal Air Force, supported by a small number of first-class military units, primarilyand of all events which foreshadow future possibilities of air action being required.For the effective use of bombs from aeroplanes, it is necessary that definite and precise targets should be given, and that the attack should be made, not by a few, but by the greatest number of aeroplanes that can be made available.With the small number of aeroplanes that was available before the outbreak of the insurrection in July, and their full employment on reconnaissance and co-operation with troops in other operations, it was not possible to arrange for the training of troops and aeroplanes to work in co-operation, but this training requires to be carried out, not only with artillery, but also with cavalry and infantry.I have, &amp;c.

The senior Air Force officer is in all cases the adviser to the Military Commander, as it is of the greatest importance that the Military Commander should receive expert guidance only from the officer best qualified to give it.H. TRENCHARD, A ir Marshal, Chief of the A ir Staff.February 18,1921.(A.) Extract from Letter addressed by General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mesopotamia, to Officer Commanding, Mesopotamian Wing, Royal Air Force, dated September 2, 1920.&quot; Thanks to the untiring devotion which all ranks have thrown into their task of maintaining the squadrons in a high state of efficiency, and despite the loss of, and damage to, a large number of machines, it has been possible to show a force in the air which has had no small effect on the general situation. The difficulty which faced me was, in some measure, to hold in check the areas where the insurrection, though it had partially broken out, had not manufactured-ally attained serious dimensions. Troops were not available for dealing ivith such areas, being required where the ins^mcction ivas at its height. The Royal Air Force, however, by frequently visiting these semi-hostile areas, materially assisted in holding wavering tribes in &apos; check, a service which proved of great value, and which relieved me of considerable anxiety. (Signed) &quot;A. HALDANE, Lieut.-General,&apos; &quot; Commanding-in-Chief, &quot; Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force.&quot;(B.) Extract from Report by Air Officer Com-manding, Middle East Area, Royal Air Force, dated January 26, 1921.&quot; A close reading of the report shows the very-great effect which intensive bombing at night or repeated at intervals during the day had on forcing tribes to make their submission.&quot; The arrival of No. 55 Squadron at the beginning of the month enabled the Air Officer Commanding to extend his operations enor-mously and to show the very important military effect which an Air Force, once freed from the daily routine requirements of the Army, can bring to bear upon a situation. The effect was out of all proportion to the actual reinforcement received, as it made it possible for Air Power to assume a vigorous offensive independently of Army co-operative requirements.&quot;The addition of No. 8 Squadron will still further accentuate this aspect.(Signed)   &quot; W. G. H. SALMOND,&quot; Air Vice-Marshal, &quot; Commandinq Royal Air Force,&quot;&apos;Middle East Area.&quot;
