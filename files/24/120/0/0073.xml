It differs from the Scottish Act by being limited to houses below the rateable value of  50 in London or  40 elsewhere, and by not applying to furnished houses.Clause 2 extends the subsidy period in accordance with the   Government1s pledges, and provides for payments i^ full u In respect of houses completed during the Interval since the rejection of last year&apos;s Bill.In order to give a better chance to the subsidy scheme I have suggested to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the period might be extended to June 1922, instead of December of this year, in view of the fact that, owing to the Lord&apos;s rejection of last session&apos;s Bill, the mctfoinent has been set back from three to six months.   If the Chancellor agrees with this suggestion I ^        propose that the Bill should provide for this further extension of the subsidy period.
Referred to Committee of Home AffairTHIS Buoir.I:   HIE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC I!AJESTY!S GOVERN] ENT,2673HOUSING BILL:Ai:;DUii BY THE MINISTER OP HEALTH,11.27,TALLIn accordance vdth the decision of the Hone Affairs /^Woo:L\ittee (II.A.CGI) I circulate a draft of a Bill extending the housing subsidy to private builders beyond, the period specified, by the Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919. and containing other clauses relating to Housing.Subject to the exceptions referred to below, the Bill is substantially in the form in which the Housing portion of the miscellaneous Provisions Bill passed the House of Commons last Session, and follows very closely the provisions of the Scottish Housing Act which was passed at the end. of last year.Clause 1 reproduces Clause 1 of the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill of last Session.   It differs from the Scottish Act by being limited to houses below the rateable value of  50 In London or  40 elsewhere, and by not applying to furnished houses.Clause 2 extends the subsidy period in accordance with the   Government^ pledges, and provides for payments in full u in respect of houses completed, during the interval since the rejection of last year&apos;s Bill.In order to give a better chance to the subsidy scheme I have suggested to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the period might be extended to June 1922, instead of December of this year, In view of the fact that, owing to the Lord&apos;s rejection of last session&apos;s Bill, the movement has been set back from three to six months.   If the Chancellor agrees with this suggestion I -propose that the Bill should provide for this further extension of the subsidy period.1 -t i
tClause o will take the place of Clause 5 of the iscellaneous Provisions Bill *nd Section 3 of the Housing (Scotland) Act.   In view of the changes   in the conditions of the building trade and. the conbequent removal of serious competition with the Housing Scheues, I have come to the conclusion that there is no longer the same need for the 9tringont provisions contained, in the former Bill.   I have therefore decided to omit four out of the eight sub-chaises of the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill and in particular to drop the contentious sub-clause relating to excessive rates of wages.   I have also abandoned the provisions of the old b Bill under which it was proposed to give&apos; the &quot;Minister of Health direct power to prohibit, luxury building, and propose to rely upon the cooperation of local authorities.Sub-clause (l) accordingly provides in effect that where the provision of dwelling houses in area A is being or is likely to be hindered by luxury building in the area of local authority fBt. local authority fB1 shall have power, on the application of local authority 1A&apos;, to prohibit luxury building in area &apos;B1.Sub-clause (2) provides that trie appeal tribunal for hearing appeals against orders of prohibition of building work may aot by a quorum of three, and that the Chairman may appoint some outside person as Chairman in case of his unavoidable absence. (This new sub-clause, which has been drafted after consultation with the Chairman of the tribunal, replaces the sub-clauses in the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill which provided that the tribunal might sit in panels,     The work of the tribunal lias fallen off greatly, so that more than one tribunal is no longer necessary).
Sub-clause3 (3) and (4) reproduce sub-clauses (7) and (8) of the iiiseellaneous Provisions Bill and Sub-sections (6) and (7) of the Scottish Act.Clause 4 reproduces Clause 4 of the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill with the exception of the proviso, which was not inserted in the Scottish Act.Clause 5 reproduces Clause 5 of the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill and is similar to Section 5 of the Scottish Act.Clause 6 takes the place cf Clause 6 of the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, but is now confined, to Housing   Acts only.     In this respect it follows the Scottish Act.Clause 7 was not in the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, but is included in the Scottish Act (Sections). At present Public Utility Societies carrying out State-Assisted Housing Schemes may only pay 6a- on borrowed money.   The Clause provides that the limit of 6% shall be removed and replaced by 1 the rate for the time being prescribed by the Treasury.1        This amendment is necessary not only in order to enable Public Utility Societies to borrow from the Public Works Loan Corn-miss loners or other sources at rates corresponding with the present market rates, but also in order to allow the Public Works Loan Commissioners to&quot;recover their interest on past loans.Clausei 8   was not in the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill and is not included in the Scottish Act.The Clause would enable the Public Works Loan 1 Commissioners to advance money on loan to an authorised association proposing to build a- garden.^ it yv-        These associations are not themselves Public Utility Societies,1-7i tj)       t-
but act as parent bodies to such societies. They are able to -work on a large scale in developing sites for building and handing over portions of the developed sites to public utility Societies or private persons intending to erect houses. In some cases they oatv erect houses themselves.   They are at the moment, however, not in a position to finance themselves wholly and as, owing to the fact that they are not registered under the Provident and Friendly Sociotiea Acts, they are not technically Public Utility Societies, they cannot obtain assistance from the Public Works Loan Comraissioners.The Treasury have agreed, subject to its operation being limited to a period of 3 years, to the principle of the Clause, which has boen pressed for by the Garden Cities Association and was very strongly supported in Parliament last Session. &apos;&apos;-V0.l iL    T1jlis Clause relates only to the Metropolis. It was not included in the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill.Under Section 41 of the Housing, Town Planning etc. Act, 1919, any loss incurred by a Metropolitan Borough Council in carrying out a housing scheme is to be repaid to them by the London County Council, any such payments being reckoned as housing expenses of the County Council.   It is clearly necessary to prescribe conditions under which su h pa mats may be made by the London County Council in order to   protect the Council and therefore ultimately the Exchequer. The Clause empowers the Minister to make regulations prescribing such conditions.Clause 10A    I understand that the Chief Secretary desires that this Bill, like the Hiseellaneous Provisions Bill, should apply to Ireland.C ADD IS ON,4.8 4*3.1921.inistry of Health.tm    4
