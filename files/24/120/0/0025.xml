152Damage cr destruction of road bridges was carried out in Co.Cork a the 15/16th.   but in other parts of the oountry this form of outrage as not been so marked lately.    It is hoped that the stopping of fairs nd markets in the neighbourhood of where suoh outrages take place will ct as a deterrent.It is of interest to know from some of the documents captured in ulcahy?s Office that a Battalion Commander reported he had found some ifficulty in overcoming the objections of his men to fire on lorries arrying hostages.    Information oontinues to oorae in more freely and the arder lately of several men believed by the I-.R.A. to be informants oint8 to the feeling of insecurity existing amongst them.    The reopening a several parts of the oountry of some of the closed polioe barracks and lie establishment of new police stations where the barracks have been sstroyed is having a good effeot on the oountry.On the 11th.
