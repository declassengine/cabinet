(P 1031) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 22132Ut February 1921.(Received 10 a.m.)Clear the line.229 S. and 232 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of the 19th February, 1098, has been repeated to Dobbs, and his comments will be communicated in due course. Some of your points, however, seem to be met by his draft treaty you will since have received, and it will save time for us to give you our views on this at once. As far as we can judge from telegraphic summary, all points in it are already covered by your authority, expressed Or implied, and on this understanding we were prepared to instruct him, Dobbs to proceed as proposed in private conference at once. In view of your misgivings, however, as to course discussions are taking, we think it advisable not to anticipate your approval. Not that we share these misgivings ourselves. We feel that Dobbs is confronted with a very difficult task, and is handling it with great skill. Nor do we read Afghan tactics in quite the same light as yourself. They renewed their fight over the tribes in the hope that we might prove amenable, seeing that events since the Mussoorie Conference have placed them in a stronger position, and made Afghanistan^ friendship more important to us than ever. They stuck to-their position up to the last moment, and then yielded. Bin, as we have already said, some face-saving is required to cover their retreat from impossible position they have had to abandon. We ourselves think that bi-lateral formula we have suggested is innocuous in fact. It will certainly be regarded as platitudinous by Indian public opinion, if it figures in a draft treaty as Dobbs proposes. In view of your misgivings, however, Dobbs may be relied on to resist it, agreeing to its inclusion only if an otherwise entirely satisfactory agreement is secured.Abandonment of development clauses has not taken us by surprise. It is probably due (1) to fear of unpopularity in the country of such developments; (2) to such financial stringency as evidenced by cutting down of pay in Army and(3) to hope that abandonment of these commitments will induce us automatically to increase cash payments.Your criticisms regarding negotiations with Bolsheviks are in part met by Dobbs&apos;&apos; draft clauses 15 and 16. Every effort will be made doubtless, by Dobbs, to secure text of proposed Bolshevik treaty before ratification.As regards subsidy, we consider an increase over that proposed under the aide-memoire is due, in consideration of our release from the indeterminate commitments, under the development clause. We therefore support Dobbs&apos; suggestion. Indeed, we go further. IiabibulhuVs subsidy amounted to 201 lakhs. Hence, if Dobbs finds, himself pressed up to 20 lakhs, we feel that he should go up to that limit, for the docking of the odd half lakh would be regarded as gratuitous pin prick. If he can secure satisfactory settlement, in these very difficult times, in subsidy granted to-Habibulla, he will have done well. 201 lakhs represents, after all, but a few days&apos; expenditure on a frontier expedition, and is a small premium to pay for a peace-on-the-frontier policy. Of our views regarding gravity of the situation, should a settlement with Afghanistan fail to eventuate, you are already aware.In short, Ave urge that Dobbs be authorised to negotiate on the lines of his draft treaty, by private or public conference as he may think best, up to limit of 20^ lakhs subsidy.
