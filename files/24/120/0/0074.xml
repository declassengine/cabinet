.....&quot; -j t \\ &apos; &apos; &apos; .....This norir&apos;!&quot;&quot;&apos; - !    Property of        /     y?*Vo iwlSvcretcciijrof&apos; State to Viccro yrfforcign Department,......f Uh March 192.1.Clear the line.1343. Your telegram dated 1st March, 2S7 S. Afghanistan. There has, I think, been misunderstanding in regard to attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards question of Bolshevik subsidy. Subsequent telegrams were not intended to be read as withdrawing from view expressed in my telegram dated 29th duly, arid we $illjstijmgly hold view that Bolshevik subsidy would in itself be strongly primd facie evidence&amp;jfyee ol: arrangements directed against British Government.i ^$rou now propose apparently despite everything that you know and we know of fipOTsnevik aims and aspirations, in the last resort to sign a Treaty with the Afghans without any disclosure of their arrangement with the Bolshevik Government, and without any stipulation that the Afghans are not to receive money or arms as presents from the Bolsheviks. 1 regret that 1 cannot assent. 1 leave it to you and Dobbs to decide in what order he should proceed. I waive the question of foreign relations. If Afghan Government refuse to consider Dobbs&apos; proposal which prohibits Bolshevik consulates and intrigue against us, negotiations will clearly be at an end, but even if they are disposed to accept these conditions the Bolshevik Treaty must be asked for as an evidence of their good faith. It is inconceivable to me that Bolsheviks are going to agree to pay the Afghans money from mere love of Afghanistan. I cannot conceal from you that the idea of a double subsidy finds little favour with His Majesty&apos;s Government and that its appearance in the Bolshevik Treaty would, I think, make the conclusion of our Treaty impossible. But in any case, when the Afghans have disclosed the Treaty, even if Dobbs thinks that its terms justify him in continuing the negotiations, it must be telegraphed to me for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Meanwhile, I must impress upon you strongly that you should not savor do anything which would appear to countenance the view that the Afghans could be allowed to receive a subsidy from the Bolsheviks, if by a Treaty with us they were to receive a subsidy from us.I regret if time has been lost, but however clearly we see the advantages of a Treaty and consequences of failure to conclude one, there is a point beyond which we cannot possibly go.I assume that Treaty will be subject to ratification and that this will be stated in it.
