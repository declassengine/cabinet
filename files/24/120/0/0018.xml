1*0Hjfl15 DOOUMENT IS THE PROPgE^^QIjJ^gI:^&apos;i!Ic&apos; TYfS GOV^RKFE rrL.G. 39ELECTORAL RT&apos;lCRATION.CONFIDENTIAL.^annual   Register   Proposala Memo rand urn by the Minister of He a it h.Mr. Boxiar Law said in the House of Commons on tho15th of November that, in view of the large saving likely to penult, the Government would introduce legislation for an annual register if the measure commended, itself to the House.     Since that date 270 members have declared them-selves in favour of an annual register,,Responsibility for electoral functions is in course of transfer from myself to,the Home Secretary, who would be in charge of any bill on the subject,     I brinp: the question forward for consideration because the actual completion of the transfer will take some little time. It has been discussed by my department at a conference with party agents end registration officers.In the first place the figures given in answer to questions in the House for the annual cost of re^istra-  -tion ( 1,750,000) and for the saving resulting from an annual register ( 700,000) are not now correct,     I have already rearranged the work so as to reduce the cost of registration by about  500,000 a year, and I am convinced that the saving resulting from an annual register would not now be more than  320,000, half to the exchequer and half to the rates,     I think further that this  320,000 would certainly be reduced to  250,000 because in the view of party officers and registration agents the annual register would mean gcjnfl back to the system of printing the electors lists for inspection by the public so as to include
all persons who appear to &quot;be Qualified, instead of printing lists containing only the names of persons to be e rided to or omitted from the current register.The balance of the savin,&apos;? would be heavily reduced and indeed might altogether disappear bees use the existing printing contracts made on advantageous terms would have to be revised on the introduction of an annual register*In the second place there is the objection in principle to an annual register that it must operate to delay the appearance on the register of a new constituency of electors who have changed their residence and of persons newly qualified,     This is a retrogression in electoral practice,In the third place I understand that there will be strong opposition to the annual register from the Independent Liberals and the Labour Party,     I am very doubtful if it will be acceptable to Coalition Liberals and I understand the Scottish Unionists will only approve it on conditions to which I see considerable objection.Accordingly I doubt whether on the merits we should proceed, any further with the proposal for an annual register. There is also to be considered, the question of the extension of the female Parliamentary franchise.     Such extension would of course make the registers much larger, and. registration much more costly,  and it might very materially affect the question of the best procedure for preparation.     I make the suggestion that a Speakerfs Conference, such as that which led to the Act&apos; of 1918, would be the best solution, if the annual register and the extension of the female franchise are to be considered togetherI would add that whatever decision be taken on these points it will probably be necessary to legislate in the present
session on the small question of the extension of time for the preparation of the Register.    A draft bill for this has already been prepared.C Addison,24c 2., 1921Ministry of Health.
