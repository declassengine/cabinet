II. EMERGENCY WORK.The Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons on the 19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. He outlined schemes for employing a large number of fit ex-Service men in connection with the Housing Programme, on which negotiations with the trade unions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme for Arterial Roads in London and in the provinces; whilst at the same time pressing forward with the Ministry of Transports programme of road classification and maintenance grants.A further statement was made by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December, indicating that the further proposals of the Government included: a final endeavour-to secure an agreement with the building trades for the admission of ex-Service men; a rapid extension of road construction schemes; the distribution by the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Viscount St. Davids, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting local authorities on relief schemes other than house building and road work; and the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit. It has since been agreed that the Unemployment Grants Committee shail also deal with schemes in respect of road work other than those undertaken by the Ministry of Transport.[5871] B 2The reports for the past week indicate a further decline in industrial activity^ and in the North-Western, Northern and Wales Divisions the increases in the Live Registers are in many cases greater than in any week since the beginning of the year. Very large numbers of men are now unemployed in the iron and steel industries and also in the ironstone mining industry. The position in the cotton trade is growing steadily worse, and, owing to the weak demand for raw cotton, the price of this commodity has fallen to that prevailing in 1913. The lull in shipbuilding on the Clyde is still very pronounced, and, in the absence of new contracts and owing to the continuance of the joiners&apos; strike, little improvement can be expected in the near future. Heavy discharges of shipyard workers have also taken place on the Tyne and on the Tees, Ship-repair work is still fairly brisk on the Mersey, but has fallen off in the South Wales ports. The position in the boot and shoe industry continuesjo improve, and at Northampton several firms are now working five days per week, while at Leicester a number of firms have been able to resume full-time working. The position^injthis trade is, however, far from being normal. Some improvement is reported in the hosiery industry, and the lace trade continues to improve very slowly. In the Midlands employment is still very slack in the brass, steel tube, metal and glass trades, and employers hold out little hope of recovery at present. The pottery trade, however, has not so far been affected by the general depression. It is reported that engineering firms are fairly busy in Lancashire and Bristol, and the favourable weather has also resulted in a considerable amount of agricultural work being put in hand. The fishing trade shows a further decline, and many of the trawler owners are laying up boats owing to the heavy running expenses. The shipping slump continues to affect employment in the transport industry.
