All parties in Georgia are united and she will undoubtedly fight to protect her independence.   In that event Azerbaijan and North Caucasus will certainly rise against the Bolsheviks when Georgian troops advance into their territories.Meanwhile Coronander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, reports on 19th February, 1921, that Armenia and Bolsheviks have started an offensive aoainst Georgia on her Southern front. The Georgian Government apparently contemplated the immediate evacuation of Tiflis, but&quot;as their front Is holding now, better councils have prevailed.
