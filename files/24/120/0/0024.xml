Wit,CABINET.CONTROL Off BEER AUD SPIRIT PRICES. MEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER.I have considered the Memorandum circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchoquer (CP,2527) regarding the retention of the control of beer and spirit pricos.BEER. (Prices)I agree with the Board of Customs &amp; Excise that the control of beer prices might now be abolished.   At present prices appear to bo maintained to the advantage of the Trade, and to tho detriment of the consumer.BEER. (Average Gravity).The present system of controlling the average gravity of beer was adopted jin order to restrict the amount of grain used for brewing. There is &apos;now no scarcity of grain, but there is a general desire that the strength of beer should be kept below the pre-war lovel.   I do not think that the control of average gravity is the proper way to limit tho strength of beer.   The statistics for the calendar year 1920 show that the actual average gravity of beer brewed in Great Britain was 1041.60 as against a permitted average gravity of 1044.0o) in Ireland the actual average gravity was 1049.90 as against a permitted average gravity of 1051.0o.   I am advised that under present conditions the high duty and reduced purchasing power will continue thus to restrict the actual average gravity.   Apart from its ineffectiveness the present control is open to the serious objoction that it inflicts hardship on individual brewers.   I am informed that one English brewer alone had to pay over  60,000 last year to other brewers under the pooling scheme to secure their unused gravity so as to enable him to produce his standard beer in restricted quantities.   Irish brewers, who may still brew up to 10510 as against 10440 in Great Britain, do not require to purchase unused gravity, and are therefore at a distinct advantage as compared with their English competitors.In the circumstances I suggest that the present restrictions on average gravity should be removed, and a maximum gravity of 1060 0 imposed in their place.   The gravity of Guinness1 stout before the war was 10740, of Bass&apos;s Ale 1061o,&amp;of London stout 10800,   The proposed maximum therefore amounts to a compulsory reduction of 18.9$, 1.6$ and 25$ respectively as compared with pre-war standards.   London stout is not now on sale,&apos; the gravity of Guinness and Bass at present on sale is 10550.I am advised that the trade generally would accept this alternative to the present restrictions, though of course they would prefer the total abolition of all restrictions.SPIRITS. (Prices).If the control of retail prices is maintained in tho interest of the consumer. I think that intor-trade prices must continue to be controlled in justice to the retailor.   But I am disposed to agree with the Board of Customs &amp; Excise that the Immature Spirits Act should be amended forthwith for a limited period, and that tho control of both inter-trade and retail prices should be withdrawn if and when this action leads to a reduction in retail prices.I would suggest that tho question of the amendment of the Immature Spirits Act should be considered by the Cabinet at an early date.Ministry of Pood, 22nd February 1921,CHARIES A. McCURDY.
