M,P* in regard to the recommendations of the select Committee on Members1 Expenses, on tho subject of travelling expenses.(intd.) A,0.Treasury,&apos;S.W.1st. March, 19210Mrc Henderson, Whip of the Labour party, requests that the following point may be considered when the question of travelling expenses of Members is before the Cabinet; namely, that a Member should have the option of a ticket to his home or to his constituency, the point being that where a Member does not live in his constituency it would pay him better to have a pass to his home.He -instances the case of Mr* Tom Shaw, Member for Preston, who lives at Colne in Lancashire.   A free pass to Preston would be very little use to him whereas a free pass to his home he could use weekly, and would pay the increase of fare to Preston when he had occasion to go there.Mr, Henderson submits this on behalf of the Labour Party, but also says they would prefer a free pass throughout the country as he believes is the custom in some foreign countries.
