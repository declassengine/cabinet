This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys GovernmentsSECRET. i fCP. 2632.THE CABINET.RESOLUTIONS OP THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LEAGUE OFNATIONS ON ARMAMENTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE PGR WAR.I circulate herewith a note by the General Staff on the Resolutions, dated 26th January, 1920, which were passed by the Assembly of the League of Nations, on the subject of Armaments.L. W.-E.The War OmoE,24th February, 1921.Resolution III. (page 4) of the Resolutions of the Ass,embly on Armaments reads as follows: &quot; The Committee^   .   .   .   invite the Council: &quot;(a.) To request the Permanent Advisory Commission for Military, Naval and Air questions rapidly to complete its technical examination into the present condition of armaments;&quot;(6.) To instruct a temporary Commission, composed of persons possessing the requisite competence in matters of a political, social and economic nature, to prepare for submission to the Council in the near future reports and proposals for the reduction of armaments as provided for by Article 8 of tbe Covenant;&quot; (c.) To form within the Secretariat a section to serve as a centre of information for the Commission, in quet-tion, and also as a channel for the publication and exchange of the information referred to in the Covenant.&quot;(d).To consider the mechanism by means of which the military information to be exchanged under the provisions of Article 8 of the Covenant can be verified in the event of the principle of mutual verification by members of the League being confirmed by an amendment of the Covenant.&quot;Article 8 of the Covenant not only provides for the formulation of plans for the reduction of armaments, but also lays down that manufacture of arms by private enterprise is open to grave objections.The question of reduction of armaments is also intimately bound up in that of the ratification of the Arms Traffic Convention for the control of the trade in arms and ammunition, which was signed in 1919 by the principal Allied and Associated Powers except ihe United States of America.Although the question of the ratification of the Arms Traffic Convention is primarily one for the Foreign Office, it is impossible to consider it without referring to its bearing on the manufacture of arms in private factories, which concerns the War Office intimately.Ratification of the convention, provided always that&apos; Russia and America are signatories thereto, would go far to dispose of any evils there may be in the private* The 6th (Armaments) Committee.

manufacture of arms, and the General Staff are of opinion that ratification should be advocated before considering the question of the private manufacture of arms.In the absence of the signatures of Russia or America, it would appear that control over the manufacture of arms in private factories would become abortive, as these countries could abuse this method of production, to the detriment of other countries, to their heart&apos;s content.The General Staff consider that no action should be taken to forbid or curtail the manufacture of arms in private factories until the Arms Traffic Convention has been ratified.As regards the reduction of armaments, the view of the General Staff is as follows: A. That no maximum to armaments can be fixed until (i.) The military terms of the Peace Treaties have been completely executed bythe late enemy Powers, (ii.) The League is a reality, including all the Great Powers of the World, and canbe counted on to support any country in a conflict threatening its national security.B. That no information as to scales of armament and programmes of construction, beyond that given to Parliament (viz., Estimates and Returns laid on the table), should be given until conditions A (i) and (ii) are fulfilled.
