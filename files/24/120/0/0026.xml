THE LEAGUEOF NATIONS BY THE,UNITED STAT7S OF AMERICA.s embassy OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.T-fc the President and Members of the, Council of the Lea-flie Vf Nations.1. The Government of the United States has reoeived infor-mation that the Council or the League of Nations, at its meeting -which is to, be held in Paris on this date, proposes to consider at length the subject of mandates, including their terms, provisions and allocation, and accordingly takes this opportunity to deliver to the Council of the -League of Nations a copy of its Note addressed, under date of November 2d 1920, to His Excellency Lord Curzon ef Kedleston, the British secretary of state for Foreign Affairs, in which the views of the United states1 are fully set forth regarding the nature of the responsibilities of mandatory powers **The attention of the Council of the Lea.*ue of Nations is particularly invited to the request therein made on behalf of this Government that the draft mandate forms intended to be submitted to the Leaf^ue of Nations to be communicated to this Government for its consideration before submission to the council of the ie&amp;$\xe, in order that the Council might thus have before it an expression of the opinion of the Government Of the United states.on the form if such mandates and a clear indication of the basis upon which the approval of this Government, which is essential to the validity of any determinations which may be reached, might be anticipated and received.   It was, furthermore, stated in said Note thatthe
the establishment of the mandate principle, a nev/ principle in international relations, and one in which the public  -opinion of the world is taking especial interest, would seem to require the frankest discussion from all pertinent&apos;points of view and the opinion was expressed that suitable publicity should be given to the drafts of mandates which it is the    -intention to submit to the council in order that the fullest opportunity might be afforded to consider their terms in relation to the obligations assumed by the mandatory powers and the respective interests of all. Governments who deem themselves concerned or affected.A copy of this Note was transmitted to the Governments of trance and Italy requesting an interpretation by each Government of the provisions of the agreement between (beat Britain, Italy and Francet signed at Sevres on August 10, l92o, relating to the creation of spheres of special interest in Anatolia, in the light of this Governments Note to the British Government of November 2q, 1920.&apos;  a reply has /onus far been received only from the French Government in which,, attention is directed to Article X of the&apos;-so-called Sevres,. Treaty Which provides in favour of nationals of third Powers, for all economic purposes, free access to the so-called zones of special interest.This Government is also in receipt of information that the Council of the league of Nations, at its meeting at Geneva on December 17 last, approved among other mandates, a mandate to Japan, embracing &quot;All tfce former German islands situated in the pacific Ocean and,lying north of the Equator&quot; The text of this mandate to Japan, which was received by this Government and which, according to available /information......
information was approved by the Council, contains the following statement: &quot;Whereas the rrinoipal Allied and Associated ^owers agreed that, in accordance with Article IZli, Part I (Covenant of the League cf ilations) Of the said Treaty, a mandate should be obnferred upon His Lajesty the Emperer of Japan to administer the said islands,   and have proposed ihat the mandate should be formulated in the following ter^s, etc.&quot;The Government of the united States takes this opportunity resoeotfully and in the most friendly spirit submit to the President and iibmbers of the Council of the League that the statement above quoted is incorrect and is not an accurate recital of the facts *   On the contraryj the United States, which is distinctly inoluded in the very definite and oonstantly used desoriptive phrase &quot;the Principal Allied and Associated powers&quot;, has not agreed to the terms or provisions of the mandate which is embodied in this text, nor has it agreed   that a mandate should be oonferred upon Japan covering all the former German islands situated in the Pacific Ocean and lying north of the Equator.The United States has never given its consent to tho inclusion of the island of Yap in any proposed mandate to Japan, but, on the other hand, at the time ofa
a discussion of a mandate covering the former German islands in the  aolfic Oooan north of the Equator, aai\ia the &quot;course of said disoussion;s-president WiXsoay ac&apos;bi;ag&quot;&apos;on beUaifc  of tho Government, was ,particular to stipulate that&apos; tho question of the . fl,is:?03ltlcn, of the Island of Yap should be reserved .&apos;. f or .f drafts console rat Ibn o   Subsequently this Govern-, merit&apos; was &quot;informed that certain of the irinoipal &apos;.AlIlecL ,snd Associated&apos;  owe^s&quot; were under te&amp;e impression that the reported decision of the Supreme Council, somoitoes described as tlie Counoil of Four, taken at its meeting on May&apos;?&apos;, ISIS* included or inserted the Island of Yap in the proposed&apos; mandate to       Japan* This Government/ in Notes addressed to the Governments of Great &quot;Britain, France, Italy and Japan, has set   , forth&apos;s.t-length&apos;its contention that Yap had in fact been excepted from this proposed mandate and was not to be included thereino&apos; Furthermore, by direction of President Wilearc&apos;the respective Governments above mentioned were informed that the Government of the United...       *   ,iStates coxacl not: concur in the reported decision of May 7, --121$, of the Supreme Council *   The information was further convened that the reservations what had , previor^y been made &apos;&quot;bjr. this government regarding the Island of Yap were based on the view that the Island of Yap necessarily constitutes an indispensable part cf any scheme or prac tic able, arrange-ment cf cable ooMTKuaic-atijen in the /
tPaoific and that its free and unhampered use should not be limited or controlled by any one Power,While this Government has never assented to the inclusion of the Island of Yap in the proposed mandate to Japan, it may be pointed out that even if one or more of the ether Principal Allied and Associated Powers wero under a misapprehension as to tho inclusion of this island in the reported decision of May 7, 1919, never-theless the Notes above mentioned of the Government of the United states make clear the position of this rfovern-mont in the matter.   At tho time when the several Notes were addressed to the respective Governments above mentioned a final agreement had not been reached as to the terms and allocation of mandates covering the former German islands in the Pacific.   Therefore the position taken in the matter by the President on behalf of this Government and clearly set forth in tho Notes referred to necessarily had the result of effectively with-drawing any suggestion of implication of assent mis-takenly imputed to this Government lone: before December 17, 1920, the date of the Council^ meeting at Geneva.As one cf the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, the United States has an equal concern and an inseparable interest with the other Principal Allied and Associated Powers in tho overseas possessions cf Germany and concedodly an equal voice in their disposition which it is respectfully submitted cannot be undertaken or effected without its assent.   The Government of the United States therefore respectfully states that it cannot regard itself as bound by the terms and provisions of said mandate and desires to record its protest against the reported decision cf December 17 l^st, of the Council of
the League of Nations in relation thereto and at the sametime to request that the Council, having obviously actedunder a misapprehension of the facts, should reopen thequestion for the further consideration which the propersettlement of it clearly requires*BAIMBREDGE COEBY.Secretary of State   of the UnitedStates,Washington, February El, 1921,Enclosure.****** iwwnux, Hi--*xmCopy Of Note from Mr, Colby tothe Rt, Hon.

ENCLOSURE TO CP, 2626EMBASSY   OP   THE united STATES W AMERICA. ( November- 20, 192c,My Lord;I Lave the honour to refer to your Note of August&apos;9 Regarding the application of the principle of equality of treatment to tho territories of the Near East to be placed under mandates, and specifically to the petroleum resources of those territories as affected by that principle.Befcivo considering the observations of His Majesty1 s Government, on the general principles advocated by the United States, and agreed to by the Allied Powers, for application to the mandaios over former Turkish /territory, as outlined in the Notes of May IB, and July 28s addressed to you cn behalf of this Government, I think it will clarify the discussion to indicate certain *t your statements and assurances which this Government has been pleased to re-oeive.     Thus^ I note that the assignment to Great Britain of the mandate   for Mesopotamia was made and. acoopted subject to no friendly arrangement- whatever with any third Government regarding ooOnomic rights, which of course, would have been wholly at varisjice-with the purpose and ecntenplaiion of any mandate.It is also gratifying to learn that His IJajestyts Government is in full. sympathy with the several propositions formulated in the Uote of May 12t above referred to,which/embodyRight Honourable Earl Cur son of kedleston. K,.GbcHis Majesty:s Secretary l).r State for Foreign Affairs, etc., etc.etc
164ombrfdy or illustrate the principles which this Government bolievo should be applied in the mandated regions, and which are essential to the practical realisation of equality ff treatment.The statements of your Note, to the effect that tho British Government has refrained from exploiting the petro-petroleum  refiouroes of the mandated territories in question;   that the operations referred to have been conducted for purely military pUrpdses under the immediate supervision of the Army authorities and at Army expenses;   and that no private interests whatever are in any way involved, are aooepted with a full sense of the good faith cf the British Government.The Government *f the United States notes that Eis Majesty1s Government has found it necessary to suspend, during the period tf ^ocupation, the grant of facilities and jjpportunities to British as well as to other private interests to investigate the natural resources of the country, either for the purpose of acquiring new claims or strengthening old.ones, and that there is no reason for assuming that theiadministration either of Mesopotamia or cf Palestine has at any time failed to carry out the assurances of His Majesty1s Government,This Government welsomes your pledges to the effect that the natural resources of Mesopotamia are to be secured -x to the people of Mesopotamia       to the future Arab State, lo be established in that region, and that it is the purpose/of
of the Brtilj^GoTB^^ to,      ^Xgartlon^ asa temporary occupant, and only to secure those reaounma tcr the Eesbpotamian State, hut also its absolute, freedom of ; action in the control thereof, and in particular that it is far from the intention of the mandatory Power to establish any kind of monopoly or preferred position in its own interest,.The Government of ths; United States appreciates, like-wise, the concurrence with its view that the merits of all claims to rights alleged to have been acquired in the mandated territories, .before the outbreak of hostilities must be duly established for recognition of such claims will be accorded,Adverting, at this point, to the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the nature of the responsibilities of mandatory Powers under the League of nations, I desire to call to the attention of His Majesty1s Government, the factiti&amp;t, while/the1 dlaft manaa^et Form A. was not adopted at paris, it was-the understanding of the American repr^s^ntaiilw^there present, that the British Government entertainedand has expressed convictions favourable- to said,form, and .that, presumably, its representatives would exercise their influence in conformity with those -*jkdjotm^O0^&apos;againI need hardly refer/to the fact that the Govern- . ment of the United States has consistently urged that it is.iof the utmost importance to&quot; the future peace of the -world -that alien territory transferred as a result of the. war with,. &apos; - ;...... ^ ,     the ...     ..
the Central Powers should be held, and administered in sucha way as to assure equal treatment to the commerce and to tho citizens of all nations,,     Indeed it was in reliance upon an understanding, to this effect,, and expressly in contemplate-tion thereof, that the United States was persuaded that the acquisition under mandate of certain enemy territory by the victorious Powers would bo consistent with the best interests of tho. worldsIt is assumed * accordingly; that your statements with reference to Mandate 1? together with the statement that the draft Mandate- for Mesopotamia and Palestine have been prepared with a view to soours equality of treatment for the commerce and citizens of all States which are members of the league of nations, do not indicate a supposition on your part that the Uaited States can be excluded from the benefits of the principle of equality of treatments &apos;This Government is pleased to find that His Majestys Government is in full sympathy &quot;with the principles formu-lated. in Its comraimications of May IE, and July 28,   But it is unable to concur in the. view, contained in paragraph 15 of your Note, that the terms of the mandates can properly be discussed-only in the Council of the, Jeague, of Nations and by the signatories of the Covenant.,    Such powers as the Allied and Associated nations may enjoy or uield, in the determination of the governmental status of the mandated areas, accrued to them as a direct result of the war againstthe
the Central Powers,     The United States,  as a narticipant in that conflict and as a contributor to its successful issue, cannot consider any - of the Associated Powers   the smallest not less than itself, debarred from the discussion of any of its consequences, or from participation in the rights and privileges secured under the mandates provided for in the Treaties of Peace,This Government notes with interest your statement that the draft mandates for Mesopotamia and for Palestine, which have been prepared, with a view to s secure equality of treatment and opportunity for th$ - commerce, citizens and subjects of all States, which are members cf the League of Nations will, when approved by the interested Allied Powers,, be communicated to the Council of the League of Nations. The United States is, undoubtedly, ono of the Powers di-rectly interested in the terms of the mandates, and I there-fore request that the draft mandate forms be communicated to this Government for its consideration before their sub-mission to the Council of the League,     It is believed that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be the more ready to acquiesce in this request, in view of your assurance that His Majesty1s Government is in full sympathy with the various principles contained in the two previous Notes of this Government upon this subject.The establishment of the mandate principle, a new principle in international relations, and one in which the public opinion of the world is taking a special interest, would seem to require the frankest discussion from all
pertinent points of view.    It would see essential that suitable publicity should be given to the drafts of mandates which it is the intention tc submit to the Council, in order that the fullest opportunity may &quot;be afforded to consider their terms in relation to the obligations assumed by the mandatory Power, and the respective interests cf all Governments, which are or deem themselves concerned or affected.The fact cannot be ignored that the reported resources of Mesopotamia have interested public opinion of the United States, Great Britain and other countries as a potential subject of economic^ strife.    Because of the fact they become an outstanding illustration of the kind of economic question with reference to which the mandate principle was especially designed, aid indeed a peculiarly critical test of the good faith of the nations, which have given their adherence to the principlei    This principle was accepted in the hope of obviating in the future those international differences that grow out of a desire for the exclusive control of the resouroes and markets of annexed territories.    To cite a single example: because of the shortage of petroleum, its constant-ly increasing commercial importance, and the contin uing necessity of replenishing the world1s supply by drawing upon/
-13-upon the latest resources of undeveloped regions, it is of the highest importance to apply to the petroleum industry the most enlightened principles recognised by nations a3 appropriate for the peaceful ordering of their economic relations.This Government finds difficulty in reconciling the special arrangement referred to in paragraphs 18 and 19 of your Note, and set forth in the so-called San Remo Petroleum Agreement, with your statement that the petroleum resources of Mesopotamia, and freedom of action in regard thereto, will be secured to the future Arab State, as yet unorganised.   Furthermore, it is difficult to harmonise that special arrangement with your statement that conces-commisionary claims relating to those resources still remain in their pre-war position, and have yet to receive, with the establishment of the Arab State, the equitable consideration promised by His ?!ajesty!s Government.This Government has noted in this connection a public statement of His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Charge of Petroleum Affairs, to the effect that the San Hemo Agreement was based&apos; on the principle that the concessions granted by the former Turkish Government must be honored.   It would be reluctant to assume that His Tiajesty&apos;s Government has already under-taken to pass judgment upon the validity of concessionary claims in the regions concerned, and to concede validity to certain of those claims which cover, apparently, the
entire Mesopotamia!! area.   Indeed this Government under-stands your Note to deny having taken, and to deny the in-tention to take, any such ex parte and premature action. In this connection, I might observe that such information aS this Government,his received indicated that, prior to the war,, the Turkish Petroleum Company, to make specific reference possessed in Mesopotamia no rights to petroleum concessions or- to the exploitation of oilj and In view of your assurance that it Is not the intention of the mandatory Power to-establish on its own behalf any kind of monopoly, T a^ at some less to understand how to construe the provision of to. a San Heirb Agreement that any private petroleum- eon-p-auy which may develop the Mesopotamian oil fields &quot;shall be under permanent British control&quot;oYour lordship contrasts the present production of petroleum in the United States with that of Great Britain and some allusion is made to American pupremacy In the petroleum industry. I should regret any assumption by Hid Majesty53 Government or any other friendly Power that the views of this Government as to the true character cf. a mandate are dictated in any degree by considerations of the domestic need or production of petroleum, or any other commodityo1 may be permitted to say, however, for the purpose of correcting a misapprehension, which your Note reflects, that the United States possesses only one-twelfth approximately
of the petroleum resources of the world.    Tho oil resources of no other nation have been so largely drawn., up on for foreign needs, and Your Lordship&apos;s statement that any prophecies as to the oil-bearing resources of unexplored and undeveloped countries must bo accepted with reserve, hardly disposes of the scientific calculations upon which, despite their problematical elements, the policies of States and the anticipations of world-production aro apparentlyproceeding.     The Government of the United States assumes that there is a general recognition of the fact that the requirementsd8?sp petroleum are in excess of production and it bolieves that opportunity to explore and develop the petroleum resources of the &quot;world wherever found.should without discrimination be freely extended, as only by the unhampered development of such resources can the.needs of the world be met.Sut it is not those aspects of oil- production and supply, in so far as they are of domestic interest to the United States with which I am concerned in this discussion, I have alluded to thorn in order to correct confusing inference, liable to arise from certain departures which I believe I discern in Your Lordship&apos;s communication from the underlying principles of a mandate, as evolved and sought to-.be -applied by the Allied and Associated Powers to the territories, brought under their temporary dominion, by their joint struggle and common victory.     This Dominion will be wholly miscencpivod, not to say abused, if there is even
of tho petroleum resources of the world.     The oil resources of no other nation have been so largely drawn..upon for foreign needs, and Your Lordship&apos;s statement that any prophecies as to the cil-besring resources of unexplored and undeveloped countries must bo accepted with roservo, hardly disposes of the scientific calculations upon which, despite their problematical elements, the policies of States and the anticipations of world-production aro apparentlyproceeding,    Tho Government of the United States assumes that there is a general recognition of the fact that the requirementsd!q?  petroleum are in excess cf production and it believes that opportunity to explore and develop the petroleum resources of the world wherever found.should without discrimination be freely extended, as only by the unhampered development of such resources.can tho.needs of the world be met.But it is not those aspects of oil- production and supply, in so far as they are of domestic interest to the United States with which I am concerned in this discussion.
