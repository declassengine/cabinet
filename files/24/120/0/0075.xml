PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.Interest during this week has been concentrated on the development of the situation in the coal mining industry, and several important conferences have been held by the men and the owners. The announcement that the Government propose to discontinue financial control of the industry as from the 31st March, which was made by Sir Robert Home on the 23rd February, has materially affected the whole position. Separate meetings of the Mining Association and of a national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain were held on the 24th February, and at both meetings resolutions were passed strongly opposing the Governments de-control proposals. That the wages question is no nearer a solution, however, was shown by a meeting of the joint negotiating committee of coal owners&apos; and miners&apos; representatives, which was held on the 25th February, without any progress being made towards agreement.The adjourned joint delegate conference* convened, by the National Executive of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress met in London on the 23rd February. The proceedings followed the expected lines; no new suggestions were made, and the conference served rather as a platform for the Labour Party&apos;s general principles than as a special body convened to deal with the specific and immediate problem of unemployment. The rapid progress of the Governments proposals with regard to unemployment insurance, together with the increased benefits, has somewhat eased the tension arising out of the unemployment situation, but meanwhile there has been a singular lack of suggestions for remedying the present slump in trade. It would appear that even wages reductions are coming to be regarded by some employers as an incidental necessity of the crisis, rather than as an effective remedy, while schemes for export credits are hanging fire, and the most favoured appear likely to be slow in coming into actual operation.Trade Boards have continued to receive considerable attention; the opposition of some employers, notably in Scotland, is again pronounced, while labour is rallying in support of the Boards. The latter movement will be focussed by the National Trade Boards Advisory Council, which is being established as a result of a conference of representatives of trade unions which was held at Caxton Hall, Westminster, on the 24th February.The result of the ballot on the Governments dilution proposals, which is being taken among members of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers, has not yet been published, and no further developments have been reported in this matter.The Unemployment Act (1920) Amendment Bill received its second reading in the House of Commons on the 23rd February, and passed through its remaining stages in that House on the following day. It was introduced into the House of Lords, and read the first and second time on the 1st March, and passed through its remaining stages on the 2nd and 3rd. On the 3rd it received Royal Assent as the &quot; Unemployment Insurance Act, 192.1,&quot; and its provisions become operative as from that day. The main pro-ceedings on the Bill in the House of Commons are outlined below, f the most important change made being an increase in the rates of benefit for men from 18s. to 205. and for women from 15s. to 16s.The Unemployment Position.Statistics. The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in the United Kingdom on the 18th February was 365,181, of which 343,087 were lodged by men and 438 by women totally unemployed, and 21,478 by men and 178 by* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 6, 5th February, p. 123. j See p. 221 below.
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.Unemployment.Relief of Unemployment-^The situation continues to cause uneasiness, particularly in the mining districts, where unemployment is rapidly increasing. The progress of the various emergency measures, however, is well maintained; and the number of additional men employed through their operation has increased.In connection with the introduction of short-time working in Government establish-ments, the threat of the trade union representatives of the departmental Joint Industrial Councils concerned to secede from the Councils has now been withdrawn, the workers being satisfied with the assurance they have received that it is the intention of the Govern-ment, and of the official side of the Councils, as representing the Government, to adhere to the objects and constitution of the Councils, and to make the fullest possible use of the machinery provided by them.*A scheme for dealing with the situation so far as it affects the textile trades has been put forward by Mr. Pv. Waddington, M.P. for the Eossendale division of Lancashire, and is under consideration by the Lancashire committee of which he is one of the secretaries. This committee consists of all the Lancashire members of Parlia-ment, who meet, irrespective of party, to discuss matters affecting the county as a whole. Mr. Waddington&apos;s scheme proposes that the banks should guarantee unsold output in order to enable the firms to continue working three or four days a week, even if their output has to accumulate until a market can be found. Tt is proposed to continue this arrange-ment for twelve weeks, by which time it is expected that the market will have recovered. In the last resort, the Treasury would be asked to guarantee the banks against loss, but it is believed that this guarantee would never be called upon. As the scheme would keep the workers employed, and would mean for them a wage of at least  2 a week, the Govern-ment would be relieved of the payment of unemployment benefit, and it is estimated that the saving on this account would be a considerable, and possibly an adequate, offset to any Treasury expenditure that might be required.Labour Policy. The joint delegate conference on unemployment of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress reassembled on the 23rd February, with Mr. E. L. Poulton, chairman of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, in the chair. As was anticipated, no motion advocating direct action was put forward, and it was unani-mously agreed that constitutional methods should be adopted to secure the acceptance of the Labour programme for dealing with unemployment. Mr. J. E. Clynes, M.P., as chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, reviewed the action of the party in the House of Commons since the earlier conference of the 27th January, and Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., moved the principal resolution, which was as follows: &quot; That this conference, representative of the whole Labour movement, is of opinion that the Governments policy of merely extending the Unemployment Insurance Act is lamentably inadequate to meet the present situation and bears little relation to the existing human suffering; and emphatically reiterates its demand that comprehensive steps be taken to restore international trade, and to organise without delay national schemes of work, and that those for whom no employment is provided should be found adequate maintenance.&quot; The conference concurs with the proposal of the Parliamentary Labour Party that every possible step should be taken to press this question on the attention of the House of Commons, and fo insist that the Government should take immediate action for the benefit of the unemployed.(b 17042T)* See p. 229 below.2 F2women working short time. On the 11th February there were 358,691 policies lodged, of which 337,618 were lodged by men and 434 by women totally unemployed, and 20,591 by men and 48 by women working short time.On the 18th February in the United Kingdom 1,483,965 unemployment books remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Act, of which 449,303 were lodged by males and 325,980 by females totally unemployed, and 287,446 by males and 421,236 by females working short time ; an increase on the previous week of 43,589 totally unemployed and 32,448 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 25th February was 1,223,000. The above are advance figures provided by the Employment Department, and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 233.
&quot; The conference further invites the executive committee of every trade union to secure the affiliation of all its branches to the local Labour parties, and to bring all its members actively into political work, in order to take the earliest possible steps to promote a Labour candidature for every constituency in which this has not yet been done. The conference further declares that every opportunity should be taken to use the by-elections as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the Government by defeating every Coalition candidate.&quot; In conclusion, the conference calls upon every wage-earning elector in Last Woolwich, Dudley, Penistone, and Kirkcaldy Burghs to mark his or her sense of the callous refusal of the Government to deal adequately with unemployment by voting for the Labour candidate.&quot;Mr. Thomas strongly denied that unemployment could not be dealt with by Parlia-mentary action. He pointed out the futility of direct action in the circumstances, and urged Labour to demonstrate its power in the approaching by-elections. Mr. Morrison, of the London Labour Party, seconded the resolution, which was finally carried with a few dissentients. The second resolution was concerned with the proposed legislation on key industries and dumping, and stated that:- -&quot; This National Labour Conference views with apprehension the apparently inspired statements in the Press concerning the proposed legislation on key industries and dumping, and instructs the Executive Committee of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress : &quot; (a) To consider the Governments Bill as early as possible in order to define the attitude ofthe British Labour movement towards the measure ; &quot; (6) To request the affiliated organisations to be on their guard against committing themselvesto support the Bill until they secure the report of their national committees; and &quot; (c) To consult with the Parliamentary Labour Party with a view to the necessary action beingtaken in the House of Commons.&quot;This resolution, which was proposed by Mr. Tom Shaw, M.P., and seconded by Mr. Sidney Webb, was also carried with very little opposition.A request that the conference would receive a deputation from the London District Council of Unemployed Organisations was refused. Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., stated that the joint executives had considered the request, and had decided that, as the delegates had been sent by their organisations to speak for the unemployed, it could not be acceded to. Mr. Robert &quot;Williams thereupon moved, and a delegate from the Blackburn Trades Council seconded, that the deputation be admitted and allowed to address the conference. The proposal was put to the vote and rejected by a large majority.Organisation of the Unem2)loyed.-rHlie London District Council of Unemployed Organisations have recently shown further signs of activity. They are endeavouring to create an unofficial organisation, representative of the unemployed of the whole country, with the object of obtaining work or maintenance at trade union rates; the immediate re-establishment of trade with Russia ; and the full and complete recognition of the Soviet Government. To this end they are appealing for the support of the organisations of the unemployed which have been formed in different parts of the country, and have proposed that a national conference be called.The unemployed in the Merthyr area have now organised themselves into one body with a central council, whose objects are to bring pressure upon local authorities to provide work or adequate maintenance for the unemployed ; to receive and distribute sums for the purpose of alleviating distress among the unemployed and their dependants; and to co-ordinate the work of all similar organisations with a view to taking concerted action if the occasion for it should arise. The executive committee of. twenty members is to consist of representatives of industries in proportion to their local importance, the miners having 6 representatives, the railway men, steelworkers and builders 3 each, the shop assistants and bakers 2, and other trades 3.Miners. The National Delegate Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, at their meeting on the 24th February, discussed the question of unemployment among the workers in the industry. The conference agreed to the principle of a levy to be paid by those in work, to supplement the war wage of 1.8s. a week payable to the unemployed men. The matter was referred to the executive to draft a scheme and forward it to the districts for their consideration. The executive met later in the day in accordance with this, decision, and appointed a sub-committee to draft a scheme. This scheme is to be considered by the executive on the 2nd March, and will then be referred to the districts for action. It is considered probable that the sub-committee will recommend a levy of 6d. per member per day worked.Action on these lines lias already been taken by the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation; and a delegate meeting of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Union, on the 26th February, adopted in
principle a scheme by which a deduction should be made from the wages of members in work, to provide a fund from which payments may be made in respect of total unemploy-ment and partial unemployment, provided that the scheme be administered nationally, and that the assistance of the mine-owners be sought for the purpose of having the deduction made at the pay offices. The executive board of the Fife, Kinross and Clackmannan Miners&apos; Association, at a meeting on the same day, also determined to recommend to their association a scheme on these lines.Control of Industry.Coal Mining Industry.--The President of the Board of Trade, on the 23rd February, received representatives of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, and the Mining Association of Great Britain, and communicated to each deputation the decision of the Government that the national control of the finance of the industry should be terminated on the 31st March. Legislation will he necessary to put this decision into operation. The Government&apos;? decision was considered on the following day by the national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation, who adopted a resolution in the following terms : &quot; That this conference confirms the attitude of the Executive in protesting against the proposal of the Government to de-control the coal trade, and declares that the Federation will oppose by every means in their power any such proposal which is prejudicial to the interests both of the coal trade and of the nation generally.&quot;The executive of the Mining Association of Great Britain also met on the 24th to discuss the Governments decision. No official statement was issued, but it is understood that the executive considered the effect of immediate de-control on the negotiations now proceeding with the Miners&apos; Federation for a permanent wages settlement, and that the unanimous feeling of the meeting was that when control ceased there could be no system of pooling profits between one district and another, and moreover, in view of the differences in costs between the districts, there could be no question of a national wages settlement.The effect of the de-control of the industry upon wages has been much canvassed since the announcement of the Governments decision. It appears that colliery owners generally will take steps to terminate the customary contracts of employment on or about the date at which the control will cease ; and the view is held in some quarters that the owners will insist that the payment of war wage, and possibly also the Sankey wage, must cease with the control. Meanwhile, the President of the Board of Trade assured the Miners&apos; Federation at the meeting on the 23rd February that the payment of war wage at those collieries which have completely closed down owing to the present lack of trade, should be continued so long as the control-susbisted. As, however, the war wage of 18s. per week will be 2s. less than the unemployment benefit under the Unemployment insurance Act, 1921, this question of the payment of war wage is losing its importance from the point of view of the relations between the Miners&apos; Federation and the Mines Department of the Board of Trade.Mr, Frank Hodges has indicated, in a speech at Pontypridd on the 27th February, one line of argument which the miners may pursue in opposition to de-control, involving an attempt to connect the miners&apos; complaint against the Government with the whole Labour opposition to the Governments policy on unemployment. He insisted that the only wajr by which industry could be revived in this country was by treating the coal trade as a national asset, coal being sold at less than cost, the difference between the price and the cost being paid by way of a Government credit until such time as the industry was thoroughly restored. Mr. Hodges drew a distinction between a Government credit and a Government subsidy. In an interview, reported in the Daily Herald of the 2nd March, Mr. Hodges has developed the argument that such a policy would bring down the cost of living, and is the only way by which the economic life of the nation can be restored. &quot; The credit of the nation must be used to secure cheaper coal.&quot; As an illustration of his argument he suggests that the money now being spent for the relief of unemployment should be granted to the coal industry, as the sovereign method by which the unemployment situation might be substantially improved.The regulation of pit-head prices and the control of the domestic distribution of coal ceased on the 1st March, and increases in the prices of certain grades of coal in Durham and South Wales have been reported.*General Topics.Trade Boards Acts. A conference of trade union representatives was held on the 24th February at Caxton Hall, Westminster, to consider the situation arising out of the
Trade Union Topics.General Union of Textile Workers. The annual delegate meeting of the union was held in the Co-operative Hall, Huddersfield, on the 26th February. Mr. Ben Turner presided. Delegates were present from the West of England, Scotland, and all the textile areas of Yorkshire. Mr. Turner&apos;s address was mainly occupied with the question of unemployment as it affects the textile industry, and with the difficult financial position in which the unions find themselves. The meeting re-elected Mr. Turner president and Mr. Hudson general treasurer of the union.National Union of Clerks. Trouble has arisen between the executive of the union and their members organised in the Trades Union Staffs Guild in connection with the programme concerning salary scales, put forward by the guild, for office staffs of trade unions. At a meeting held in London on the 21st February, it was decided that the guild should secede from the union and affiliate with the Clerical and Administrative Workers&apos; Confederation, which was formed in May, 1920, as a result of disputes between the National Union of Clerks and certain branches in South Wales. This decision has not been endorsed by the trade union office staffs at Manchester, as, at a meeting held on the 26th February, these members decided to remain in the union. The clerical staff of the National Union of railway men have decided &quot; to do everything in their power to proceed with the work of the Trade Union Staffs Guild, under the auspices of the National Union of Clerks, while strongly supporting appeals to the annual conference against the Executive Committee&apos;s decision with regard to the Guild programme.&quot;Union of Post Office Workers. The strike policy recently adopted by the union, which has caused some dissension among the members, was discussed at a mass meeting held in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, on the 16th February.  An appeal was made by therecent attacks on Trade Boards; and it was decided that a National Trade Boards Advisory Council should be established. The objects of the Council are to secure a common trade union policy regarding the methods adopted by the Government in estab-lishing Trade Boards ; to consult with the General Council of the Trades Union Congress on all questions relating to Trade Boards which are of general interest to the unions affiliated to the Congress ; to make, when necessary, joint representations to the Govern-ment on behalf of the trade unions represented on Trade Boards ; to secure joint con-sultation between the unions represented on Trade Boards on all questions relating to the regulations dealing with wages, hours, conditions of employment, or other occupational interests of their members, and to make joint recommendations on these questions as and when necessary.A resolution was passed unanimously condemning the action of a section of the employers in attempting to destroy, or limit, the power of Trade Boards, and denouncing the efforts now being made to deprive over 3,000,000 workers of the protection at present secured to them by the Boards, as &quot; a deliberate attempt to re-establish sweating in its vilest form, and an attack on a section of the working class least able to bear any reduction in their standard of living.&quot;A deputation from the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Ware-housemen and Clerks visited the Minister of Labour on the 21st February, to request the immediate establishment of additional Trade Boards in the distributive trades.Building Guilds.-T]\e establishment of a National Guild* has been brought nearer by a joint conference of the Manchester Building Guild and the London Guild of Builders, Ltd., held in London on the 14th February, when it was unanimously agreed to amalgamate the two bodies into a National Guild. Regional Councils will be formed and invested with full powers to enter into and carry out contracts, while the National Board will be invested with legal powers, and will deal with all general questions of policy, finance, credit and insurance. In this way it will be possible to preserve a considerable measure of local autonomy, while securing the advantage of one central authority to deal with questions of a national character. An instance of the way in which guild practice is spreading is afforded by the recent affiliation of the Manchester District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union to the Building Guild. The effect of this will be that the Electrical Trades Union will take over the work connected with electrical appliances wherever the latter are required under the guild&apos;s housing contracts.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Shale Miners and Od Workers : Scottish Oils, Ltd. Arising out of the notices given by Scottish Oils, Ltd., to their employees for a reduction in wages of 2s. a day from the end of February, and the discontinuance of the supply of household coal at a special rate similar to that allowed to coal miners,* negotiations took place on the 23rd February at Glasgow between the company and representatives of the Scottish Shale Miners&apos; Association, the Scottish Oil Workers&apos; Association and the Engine Keepers&apos; Association. The first named Association had previously recommended their members not to accept the proposal with reference to the reduction, of wages if the coal miners&apos; wages were not reduced by the end of February, and advised them to resist the decision on the withdrawal of the concession with reference to cheap household coal. The question of the wages reduction, however, has been eliminated from the dispute owing to the fact that shale miners&apos; wrages are regu-lated on. the same basis as those of coal miners, and that under the terms of the national coal strike settlement the coal miners, after the 27th February, have lost all advances on their pre-strike pay. So far as the Oil Workers&apos; Association, and the Engine Keepers&apos; Association were concerned, it was agreed at the meeting on the 23rd February to accept the wages reduction proposed. With regard to the question of cheap coal, the company suggested that coal should be supplied at 30s. a ton, instead of at 14s. as at present, until the end of March, when the matter will again be considered. The representatives of the Shale Miners&apos; Association referred the questions in dispute back to their executive, wrho decided, on the 26th February, to accept the wages reduction, provided that a concession was made on the question of the price at which domestic coal will be supplied.Ironstone Miners (Cleveland,). The Cleveland Miners and Quarrymen&apos;s Association met the Cleveland Mine Owners&apos; Association on the 28th February. They agreed that the 2s. a shift advance conceded at the time of the coal strike settlement should be withdrawn, and that the war wrage of 3s. a day should not be paid for idle days. The owners have given notice for the termination at the end of March of the war wage of 3s., the Sankey wage of 2s., and the 20 per cent, advance given last March.Sporting Gun Operatives (Birmingham). The Birmingham branch of the Workers&apos; Union have given notice that their members will refuse after the 5th March to handle foreign components in the manufacture of sporting guns proved at the Birmingham proof house. They allege that a considerable number of parts are imported from the Continent in a finished or semi-finished condition, and that their members engaged in the sporting gun trade are employed upon fitting these components to the gun stocks before the products are despatched to the proof house for marking as Birmingham guns. An application for a conference has been made to the Sporting Gun Manufacturers&apos; Association, but the associa-tion have declined to meet the representatives of the Workers&apos; Union in order to discuss this question, on the ground that any action which might be considered desirable should only be taken by Parliament.Bleaching and Dyeing Operatives (Scotland).--The Scottish Federation of Dyers and Bleachers (Piece Goods) having intimated to the Amalgamated Society of Dyers, Bleachers, Finishers and Kindred Trades their intention to substitute a monthly for a quarterly adjust-ment of wages for all workers affected by the cost-of-living sliding scale, and to enforce a chairman for loyalty to the executive committee&apos;s decision, which was based on instructions received from the annual conference held at Morecambe last year. Constitutional action was advocated; and it was urged that if a majority were not in favour of the executive committee&apos;s decision, an alteration could be made at the next annual conference, but that unofficial action and strife between the various sections would prevent the union from continuing their work in the interests of every grade in the postal service. A resolution was passed unanimously approving the action of the executive committee in adopting the strike policy.
reduction of wages of all employees under 20 years of age as from the first pay day in March&apos; a ballot vote was taken by the union which resulted in a majority in favour of a strike Both parties, however, have now agreed to submit the questions in dispute to arbitration, Sir Thomas Munro being selected as arbitrator.  Pending his award, the employers have cancelled their notices.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Co-operative Employees (Ashton-under-Lyne).-A lightning strike of the 300 employees, including branch managers and clerical staff, of the Ashton-under-Lyne Working Men&apos;s Co-operative Society began on the 26th February, in consequence of the dismissal of a carter who refused to give up his membership of the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers, and join the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association. It was reported that the committee were taking a vote of the 10,000 members of the society on the question, and had decided to give their employees until the 2nd March to return to work ; but a mass meeting of the members of the society was held on the 28th February, when a resolution was passed recommending the committee to reinstate the man concerned, withdraw the notices given to 17 other carters, and agree to meet the representatives of the National Amalgamated Union of Distributive and Allied Workers under an independent chairman with a view to a settlementsSettlements and Agreements.Coal Miners (National).-The national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain met on the 22nd February to receive the replies of the districts to the questionnaire, which had been submitted to them on certain matters of principle in connec-tion with the negotiations with the Mining Association of Great Britain concerning the preparation of a scheme for the regulation of wages in the industry, upon the expiry of the temporary settlement which closed the national coal strike in November last.f This meeting had been preceded by a meeting on tho previous day of the executive of tfie Miners&apos; Federation who also reviewed the replies to the questionnaire, but no public statement has been made with regard to the proceedings of either meeting. It is understood, however, that the replies showed a preponderance of opinion in favour of incorporating alLthe present district percentages into a new 1921 standard, with the Sankey wage and war wage as a new combined flat rate in addition thereto; in favour of the regulation of future wages by national flat rate advances or reductions ; and in favour of accepting, for the purposes of negotiation, the principles of a minimum profit for the owners of capital, bearing a definite relation to a minimum rate&apos;of wages for the workmen, and of the distribution of the proceeds of the industry, after meeting the standard wages and minimum profits, in a fixed proportion between miners and owners.A meeting took place between representatives of the Miners&apos; Federation and the Mining Association on the 25th February, at which a deadlock appears to have occurred in conse-quence of the decision of. the owners, arrived at on the previous day, that in view of the proposed early decontrol of the industry detailed national settlements were impracticable. The owners could entertain no alternative to an agreement basing wages upon the wage-paying capacity of the districts, preserving for national discussion only the enunciation of certain general principles which might provide the districts with some uniform method of determining this wage-paying capacity.The executive of the Miners&apos;. Federation meet on the 2nd March to receive a report of the proceedings at the joint meeting of the 25th February.Meanwhile, in accordance with the provisions of the second part of the agreement which terminated the national coal strike, the Secretary for Mines has announced that after the 27th February no wages advance is payable to colliery workers under the agreement. The output figure for the test period ending the 19th February was 17,654,4.00 tons, as compared with the rate of 19,040,000&apos;tons in the September quarter. The result, therefore, is that the wages advance disappears altogether. The Daily Herald, on the 28th February, put forward the argument that the agreement contained no provision for a reduction in the advance below Is. per shift for adult workers, but the interpretation of the agreement adopted by the Secretary for Mines has not been publicly disputed elsewhere.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Department Section of the Report, pages 227 to 231.]* This strike was reported, on the 3rd March, to have been settled by the reinstatement of the dismissed carter.f See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 6, 5th February, p. 130.
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.WOODWORKING AND  FURNISHING.Bobbin and Shuttle Making.-AX tlie annual meeting on the 21st February, the Industrial Council decided to support the proposals of the Pottery Council in connection with relief from income tax as regards expenditure on welfare schemes. The Council then discussed the question of women workers&apos; wages under the agreement dated the 8th November, 1920. A representative of the workers asked whether the employers would now agree to an advance. The chairman said that he considered the women were being paid a fair rate of wages, that no further increase was possible, and that the cost of living was going down. As the decision of the employers appeared to be very definite the discussion on this point closed.It appears that the shuttle manufacturers are contemplating secession from the Council; they are not interested in the deliberations of the Bobbin Section, and their own-difficulties are dealt with by machinery which is practically identical with that which existed before the Council came into being. A decision on this point, however, has not yet been arrived at.BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Painters (Wisbech).-Thirty-five painters at Wisbech ceased work on the 19th February, as a protest against the action of the master painters in reducing wrages from Is. lid. to Is. id. per hour. The Chief Conciliation Officer has endeavoured to arrange a joint conference, but, so far, the employers wall not agree. The National Federation of Building Trades Operatives are considering proposals to withdraw their labour in support of the painters.Heating and Domestic Engineering. The Emergency Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 24th February. The secretary of the workers&apos; side reported that his society had decided to reject the award of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress on the demarcation dispute between the plumbers and the heating and domestic engineers at Manchester. * . In this they are supported by the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades. He stated that his society had not had sufficient time for the preparation of their case, their witnesses had been limited, and the case had largely been influenced by the question of wages.The heating and domestic engineers are circulating the facts of the case to all architects and Housing Committees in the country, and are preparing a statement for publication. They are also forwarding a statement to the Ministry. It was decided that the employers&apos; association should take no action in the dispute, because the union&apos;s case, which is likely to come up before the Trades Union Congress, would be considerably weakened if it were thought that they were being assisted by the employers.FOOD AND DRINK.Scottish Balers. A ballot of the operatives is to be taken on the question of the abandonment of the principle of a national working agreement. The ballot is to be closed on the 14th March, and in the meantime the employers have been requested by the union to continue the provisions of the present agreement, which is due to expire on the 28th February. The Chief Conciliation Officer has been urged to do his utmost to prevent the ultimate breakdown of the Council. He has been requested to see each side separately, and to place before them suggestions that the wages difficulty might be overcome either by adopting a grading scheme, or by forming District Councils with powers to settle all wage questions. He has been asked to point out, as regards the employers&apos; contention that the operatives have used the Council only for wages questions, that the introduction of other subjects of discussion might usefully come from the employers&apos; side.* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 8, 19th February, p. 177.

flour milling, The adjourned meeting of the Industrial Council was held on the 24th February, when a solution to the difficulty on the question of short time which had arisen at the previous meeting was found by simply reaffirming the resolution passed on the 15th April, 1920, and dropping the other resolutions proposed at the previous meeting.* The employers&apos; side agreed to send out a covering letter with this resolution, recommending to their members how, in their opinion, it should be interpreted. This letter was to include a recommendation that no man should lose more than two-elevenths of his total wages, but that where full time is already being worked no reduction in hours should be made.TRANSPORT.Road Transport (London). The employers&apos; association have agreed to the terms of reference as amended, and the matter has now been referred to the Industrial Court.POTTERY AND RUBBER.Potteries (Scotland). The joint conference arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer was held on the 21st February, when the employers made an amended offer to reduce the war wages by 2cl. per hour for men and Id. per hour for women and boys, and to refer the remainder of their previous reduction to arbitration outside the Conciliation Board. At a mass meeting held on the same day the workpeople rejected the amended terms, and offered arbitration on the whole question. The Chief Conciliation Officer is endeavouring to arrange a further conference.CHEMICALS AND EXPLOSIVES.Cokemen and Bye-Product Workers (Glasshougldon). The wages of cokemem and bye-product workers in most cases seem to follow agreements&apos;in the coalmining industry. On this account the West Yorkshire Coal Owners&apos; Association advised the Yorkshire Coking and Chemical Co., Glasshoughton, an associated firm, to pay the miners&apos; war wage, &quot; work or play,&quot; to their employees. On the Cth January the manager suggested to the union organiser that the men should forgo this war wage when not employed, as otherwise considerable numbers would have to be dismissed. Following the general policy of the union, this proposal was not accepted. An attempt to make a local arrange-ment with the local secretary of the union, as distinct from the district secretary, failed, and lock-out notices were given expiring on the 29th January. On the same day the firm posted a notice giving the names of men they were prepared to employ at the old rates of wages, including full war wages &quot; work or play.&quot; The union secretary posted a counter-notice stating that the workers accepted the lock-out notices. None the less, 80 men accepted the offer of work, and they were thereupon expelled from, the union, the firm being declared a non-union yard. The 141 men who obeyed the union&apos;s instructions are now unemployed.On the .16th February a meeting took place in London between the National Asso-ciation of Coke and Bye-Product Plant Owners and the National Union of Cokemen and Bye-Product Workers, when it was hoped that some understanding of a national character would be reached which would, facilitate a settlement at Glasshoughton. No settlement was attained. The union are arranging to discuss the general situation at an early date with the Miners&apos; Federation.Attempts are now being made to bring the parties together. The secretary of the employers&apos; association is willing to advise the firm to re-start negotiations with the union if they can show, any claim to represent the men concerned. The union district organiser has therefore been advised to reconsider the expulsion of his members.The coke-plant owners state that wages in their industry should not follow mining wages because the latter vary with output. In some plants, when the men y/ere in the general unions, wages used, to follow rates in the heavy chemicals industry. It would seem that most of the workers have transferred to the cokemen&apos;s union, who, now they are affiliated to the miners, are attempting to insist upon miners&apos; rates and conditions.TEXTILES.Coir Mat and Matting.--The Joint Industrial Council met on the 24th February. The unrestricted importation of mats and mattings from India was discussed, and the Council decided to request the Board of Trade to include the industry within the provisions of the Anti-Dumping BiU, and to ask the President of the Board of Trade to receive a deputation on the question.
In view of the state of the industry the Council were unable to endorse a scheme for training disabled men. As regards the improvement of the working conditions and health of juveniles employed in the industry, and the provision of facilities for technical education and training, it was decided that, as the industry is small and widely scattered, no useful action could be taken at present.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. By resolution of the Emergency Committee of the Joint Industrial Council, in consequence of the fall of the cost-of-living index number from 105 to 151, the cost-of-living wages are to be reduced as from the first pay-day in March in the proportion of 1G5 to 155, The reduction is about 2s. to 2s. Gd. a week for women ; and 2s. 6d, to 4s. 6d. for men, with an average of about 3s. Id. a week.MINING.Lead Mining. At Leadhills the ballot has been taken, and the workers have agreed to accept the company&apos;s terms by a majority of 9. At Wanlockhead the miners have declined to take a ballot until they learn the views of the employers on their request for an independent audit of the firm&apos;s books. The secretary of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; County Union has asked the local officials to proceed with the ballot, but he is doubtful whether they will do so. The Wanlockhead Mining Co. have stated that they never offered to allow an independent audit, and they do not propose to agree to the suggestion.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Supply. The Gloucester City Council have adopted the recommendation of their representatives who attended the conference with representatives of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association, at Montagu House on the 10th February. The association^ strike notices have been withdrawn.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services [England and Wales).  The first annual meeting of the Council was held on the 24th February. All the officers were re-elected, and the Executive and Salaries Committee were reconstituted. It was decided to hold a conference at an early date to consider representations made by employers&apos; associations concerning the constitution and functions of the National Council, and of the Provincial Councils, and to consider also the geographical areas which the Provincial Councils cover.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).  The Executive Committee of the National Council, on the 23rd February, received a deputation from the Provincial Council for the Northern Home Counties in regard to the failure of the local authorities in the area to support the Council. They decided to recom-mend that conferences of representatives of the local authorities in each county should be convened by the National Council, to consider the position.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Air Ministry Industrial Council- A meeting of the Council was called for the 23rd February, but could not be held owing to the absence of a quorum on the trade union side.The working of the short-time scheme in Air Ministry establishments has proceeded smoothly, for the most part, with the co-operation of the employees. As a result, 98 tradesmen, 274 storemen and general workers, and 23 women have been taken on.A striking feature of the scheme has been the institution in most of the establishments of a voluntary benefit fund, contributed to by the workpeople retained on full time, and by the administrative clerical staff. Grants have been made to those standing off, ranging from 10s. a week in some establishments to 30s. in others.Government Industrial and Trade Joint Councils. On the 25th February a conference of trade union representatives of the Government Industrial and Trade Joint Councils was held at Montagu House to discuss the situation that had arisen as a result of the withdrawal of the unions in protest against the policy adopted by the Government in respect of short time. The chairman and the secretary of the conference, acting as a deputation, saw the Principal Assistant Secretary, and stated that the trade unions were desirous of securing an undertaking from the Government that the procedure followed in the case of the short-time scheme would not be repeated, but that the Government would use the Whitley machinery for consultative purposes on future occasions.  The Principal Assistant(b 17042T) 2 G 2
Secretary explained the difficulty of securing a formal undertaking from the Government, and suggested that a deputation should confer on the position with Sir Malcolm Ramsay and the Principal Assistant Secretary at the Treasury. A deputation represented to Sir Malcolm Ramsay that the executive committee of the unions concerned requested an assurance from the Government that in future the constitution and objects of the Councils would be respected, and that, if this assurance could be given, the trade union representatives on the Councils were prepared to withdraw their resignations.In reply, Sir Malcolm Ramsay gave the deputation a written statement in the following terms : &quot; The trade union representatives had suggested that it is not the intention ot the Government to carry out the objects and constitution of the Industrial Councils; Sir Malcolm Ramsay gives the trade union representatives an assurance that they are mistaken in their view, and that it is the intention of the Government, and of the official side as representing the Government, to carry out the objects and constitution of the Whitley Councils, and to make the fullest possible use of the opportunity for discussion provided by the Whitley machinery.&quot;This assurance was conveyed to the conference, and the Principal Assistant Secretary was subsequently informed that a resolution had been adopted accepting Sir Malcolm Ramsay&apos;s assurance.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Porters (Covent Garden). At the further conference* held on the 24th February it was clear that there could be no agreement on the suggested abolition of the system of porterage charges, the Covent Garden Fruit Brokers&apos; Association and the London Fruit, Flower and Vegetable Markets Association contending that such a step would adversely affect the London markets in favour of the provincial markets. The proposed schedule of revised porterage charges jointly submitted by the unions was then discussed. It was eventually agreed that a sub-committee should draw up a further schedule, based on a general increase of 133 per cent, on pre-war rates, arbitration to be resorted to in the event of a failure to arrive at a settlement.Warehousemen (Liverpool). Arrangements have been completed for a preliminary meeting of the parties before the National Docks Joint Council in London on the 3rd March. At that meeting the United Trades&apos; Association propose to set forth their position and to endeavour to persuade the Joint Council to hear their case under a neutral chairman. With regard to the three firms where the reduced rates of pay for warehousemen are now in operation, strike notices have been withdrawn and it has been agreed that the reduced rates shall continue pending a settlement, but that no other firms shall give notice of a reduction in the meantime.Gas Mantles. The Industrial Council met on the 14th February. A representative of the Board of Education attended to explain the system of compulsory day continuation schools.The industry is working only 32 hours per week, and there is understood to be difficulty in placing accumulated stocks.Lock, Latch and Key. The Industrial Council met on the 14th February, when the question of a reduction in wages came up for consideration. No decision was arrived at, and it was agreed to adjourn the meeting for further discussion until the 28th February.Needle, Fish-Hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. The Industrial Council met on the 17th February. Discussion centred mainly round the probable necessity for a general reduction- in wages owing to the state of trade, and reference was made to the low rates obtaining in Germany, from whom competition was feared.Women Workers: Royal Airship Factory (Cardington). An airship factory at Carding-ton, previously controlled by Messrs. Short Bros., Ltd., was taken over by the Air Ministry from the 1st April, 1920. The firm were affiliated to the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations, at the time when the Federations agreed with various trade unions to recommend an advance of 36&apos;. Qd. per week to female workers, 18 years of age and over, effective from the pay-day following the 22nd December, 1919.Messrs. Short Bros, did not pay this advance, and the Air Ministry continued to pay the wages paid by the firm at the time of transfer. On the 13th July, 1920, the Workers&apos; Union formally preferred a claim against the Ministry for the advance in question, payment to be retrospective to the 22nd December, 1919,,on the ground that the advance should have been paid by Messrs. Short Bros, as from the agreed date, and, further, that an undertaking
was given that the advances operative in the engineering trade would be paid in the factory. The Industrial Court held that the claim was established. It was considered that the justice of the case would be met by the payment of the advance as from, and including, the first pay following the 13th July, 1920.   (Award No. 620.)Cinema Operators (Bristol)-The Chief Conciliation Officer, Bristol, reports a strike of two operators employed in two Bristol picture-houses. In August, 1920, an agreement was reached between the Cinema Exhibitors&apos; Association and the Electrical Trades Union, Bristol, among the matters covered being rates of wages to operators. The employer in question, who is a member of the Cinema Exhibitors&apos; Association, is not paying these rates, and the Electrical Trades Union have withdrawn the two operators without notice. The association are not disposed at this stage to meet the union, on the ground that the employer declines to be a party to the negotiations of the association ; but when the associa-tion meet on the 1st March, it is understood that the position will be considered. There is a possibility of an extension of the dispute.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Insurance Workers. The strike of insurance officials in the service of the General Accident, fire and Life Insurance Corporation continues. The Minister saw Mr. Norie-Miller, general manager of the Corporation, on the 2] st February, with a view to bringing about a settlement, and indicated that in his view the formation of some kind of Whitley machinery in individual offices appeared to be a desirable thing. Mr. Norie-Miller stated that he was not unfavourable to this course, but that the time Was not yet ripe. As to the dispute itself, he stated that the dismissals which had led to the strike were not in consequence of member-ship of the Guild alone ; no ban had been placed upon membership of the Guild so far as members of the staff who did not hold responsible or confidential positions were concerned. He was not prepared to meet the secretary of the Guild, owing to the bitter personal attacks that had been made upon him, but he was prepared to submit individual state-ments in regard to each member of the staff who had been dismissed, if they would also submit statements to the Ministry.GENERAL.Reduction of Wages : Deputation from Parliamentary Committee of Trades Union-Congress. Sir David Shackleton, with Mr. H. J. Wilson and Mr. H. Wolfe, received a depu-tation from the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress on the subject of the present movement to reduce wages, with special reference to the position of women in the Midlands. The deputation drew attention to the extent to which reductions are taking place throughout the country. Owing to the present abnormal unemployment lower rates, in many instances, are being taken, with a consequent lowering of the standard of life. It was urged that the Minister should use his powers under Part II of the Industrial Courts. Act, and set up Courts of Inquiry on the question of reductions.The deputation were informed of the practical difficulties, and of the necessity of first employing the procedure outlined in Part I of the Act; an inquiry could only be considered when other machinery had been exhausted, and when a dispute was one of general public interest.The deputation appealed for temporary legislation to prevent what they termed a &quot; landslide,&quot; urging that a Bill should be introduced prohibiting employers from making reductions until the matter had been referred to an impartial tribunal. They insisted that the withdrawal of the protection given by the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts before the establishment of Trade Boards was the cause of the present situation. They complained of unnecessary delay in establishing these Boards. Sir David Shackleton pointed out that this was a demand, for &quot; compulsory arbitration &quot; against employers.The deputation were informed, that on the general question of reductions in the engineering and allied trades, steps had been taken, by the department to bring the parties together, and a conference was being held with the unions on the 3rd March, when it was understood that the matter would be discussed on a national basis. It was hoped that the result would be an agreement which would stabilise the position in these trades, and indirectly have a steadying effect on the nut, bolt, screw, and other allied trades. An under-taking Was given that, if the department were notified of any proposed reductions, steps would be taken without delay to get into touch with the firms or associations concerned, with a view to arranging conferences between representatives of the employers and of the workpeople, so that, if any alterations in rates were necessary, it Would be a matter for agreement.[Reference to matters of interest in connection tvith Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 220 to 226, 232, 233, 239 and 240.]
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS. PROCEEDINGS.Sugar Confectionery and Food Preserving Trade Board (Great Britain). The Adminis-trative Committee considered the draft Special Order relating to the application of the Trade Boards Acts to the meat distributive trade, and agreed to inform the Minister that they did not desire to raise any objection with regard to the definition of that trade.After considering the question of the introduction of short time in the trade, the committee agreed to inform the Ministry that this system was the common practice in times of depression.The committee also considered resolutions passed by the Perth and Plymouth Women&apos;s Employment Sub-Committees, and agreed to inform the Women&apos;s Sub-Committee of the Perth Employment Committee that they were of opinion that the position of late entrants into the trade was fully safeguarded by the present provisions of the Trade Board&apos;s determination.The committee considered the opinions expressed by the Ministry with regard to the scope of the Board, and agreed to express their disapproval of the existing procedure under which opinions on questions of scope involving questions of fact were expressed by officials without reference to the Trade Board, and to forward, a protest on this matter to the Com-mittee appointed to consider the administration of the Trade Board Acts. They also agreed to ask the Ministry whether there were any special reasons why the Board&apos;s opinion that workers employed in washing bottles, carrying jars of jam and handling empties, as well as workers employed in the preparing of nut foods for sale in a preserved state in tins, pots, bottles and similar receptacles, were within the scope of the Board, had been overruledCotton Waste Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered a motion put forward by the employers&apos; representatives for the issue of a Notice of Proposal to vary the minimum rates by reductions of certain amounts. After considerable discussion, suggestions were made on behalf of the employers&apos; representatives for an agreement respecting the periodical adjustment of minimum wages in accordance with fluctuations in the cost-of-living index number.Milk Distributive Trade Board (England and Wales.) The Administrative Committee considered a letter from the Agricultural Wages Board relating to the scope of the Milk Distributive Trade Boards in relation to that of the Agricultural Wages Board. It was resolved that, subject to the Wages Board agreeing to consider a worker to be within the scope of the Trade Board from the time he &quot; leaves the farm for the purposes of the retail distribution of milk, instead of from the time he begins to distribute milk,&quot; the committee would be prepared to concur substantially with the views expressed by the Agricultural Wages Board. The committee agreed to forward to the Ministry particulars of cases of alleged evasion with a request that inquiry should be made at once.Pin, Hook and Eye and Snap Fastener Trade Board (Great Britain). A motion for a 25 per cent, reduction in the minimum rates of wages at present fixed or proposed by the Board was not carried, and further consideration of this question was deferred.Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain). A report from the Cigar Committee on the minimum rates of wages proposed for indentured apprentices in the cigar section of the trade was referred back, to afford the representatives of the London manufacturers a further opportunity to consider the question of different rates for apprentices.After considerable discussion of the motion for the increase in the minimum rates of wages at present in operation, which had previously been deferred, the Board resolved not to increase the present rates.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (Ireland). The Minister has made an Order dated the 15th February, confirming general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates as fixed for certain classes of male and female workers, and has specified the 1st March as the date from which these rates are effective.The general minimum time-rates as fixed for female workers, other than learners and apprentices, are, in (1) the retail branch of the trade, (a) %\d. per hour for those 22 years of age and over, employed within the areas of the County Boroughs of the Cities of Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Waterford
3335.3.21.General Department-continued.and Londonderry, with not less than 3 years&apos; experience after learnership in the trade; (b) 8^d. per hour for other workers in the same areas; (c) 9(/. per hour for workers of the same age and experience as those included in (a) above, who are employed in other areas ; (d) &amp;%d. per hour for all homeworkers : and (2) in all other branches of the trade, (a) lid. per hour for workers employed as knife cutters and Mockers, and (b) Sd. per hour for all other workers and for home workers. The general minimum time-rates as fixed for male workers are Is. 2d. per hour for those 22 years of age and over, with lower rates for younger workers. The piece-work basis time-rates as fixed are 1C%/., Qld., lOcl., tyd. and Is. and 9(1. per hour for the female workers specified in 1 ((?), 1 (b), 1 (c), 1 ((/), 2 (a) and 2 (b) above, and Is. 3Jrf, per hour for male workers.Overtime rates are fixed for all workers engaged on time-work or piece-work, and for this purpose the Board have declared the normal number of hours of work to be 48 in any week ; 9 on any week-day other than the weekly short clay, Sunday or customary public or statutory holidays ; and 5 on the weekly short day. Special provision is made for cases where it is the established practice of an employer to require attendance only on five days a week, or only on alternate Saturdays, or on Sunday instead of Saturday.Perambulator and Invalid Carriage Trade Board (Great Britain).-rr\ie Minister has made an Order dated the 18th February, confirming general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates, and overtime rates as varied or fixed for certain classes of male and female workers and has specified the 28th February as the date from which these rates become effective.The general minimum time-rates for workers 21 years of age and over range, according to the particular class of work, from Is. M. to 2s. per hour in the case of male workers, and from M. to Is. Id. per hour in the case of female workers. Lower rates are fixed for male and female workers under 21 years of age, employed in learning one or more of the operations to which the above-mentioned rates are applicable, or employed as porters or labourers. The piece-work basis time-rates for male and female workers are 10 per cent, above the appropriate general minimum time-rate.Overtime rates are fixed for male and female workers of all ages employed on time-work and piece-work, and for this purpose the Board have declared the normal number of hours of work in any week to be 48.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on pages 220, 223, 224, 231, 238, 240 and 241.]EMPLOYMENT AND INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies, and placings during the week ending the 18th February : 	Men.

While the rapid rate of increase in the number of persons unemployed would appear to have been arrested, there is no evidence that the industrial outlook is brighter. At the moment, changes in the situation in most centres are largely confined to an ebb and flow between short-time working and intermittent total stoppages.
Iron and Steel. Diminished activity is still a feature of the iron and steel industries. At Consett, about 1,200 men are idle through the closing of rolling mills, and at Middles-brough and South Bank 700 men are affected by the damping down of furnaces. The posi-tion in South Wales is stated to be growing more serious, as, in addition to a further stoppage at Cardiff, 1,800 workpeople have been thrown out of employment by the closing down of large works at Newport.   At Scunthorpe, of 17 blast furnaces only 2 are now blowing.Coal Mining. Unemployment is increasing in the coal mining and coke oven industries, and the reports from the Northern Division and from South Wales forecast further dis-charges in these industries in the near future.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. The position on the Clyde is substantially un-changed, but unemployment among shipwrights is increasing owing to a scarcity of new work. On the Tyne, Tees, and Wear the only change is at Hartlepool, where the delivery of material has resulted in more workpeople being engaged on construction work. There has also been greater activity on repair work. On the Mersey the effects of the joiners&apos; strike are becoming more pronounced, and very little work is coming into the yards. Repair work at Bute Docks, Barry, Newport and Swansea has slackened somewhat. At Cowes, Messrs. J. S. White &amp; Co. have discharged 100 workmen from their engine depart-ment.Textiles and Clothing. Reports from the North-Western Division indicate that the depression in the cotton industry is becoming more pronounced, and the prolonged stoppage ot mills is now the rule, rather than the exception. The demand has fallen to such an extent that manufacturers are unable to dispose of their heavy stocks, even at a considerable loss. Distress is becoming more acute owing to the depletion of trade union funds.With regard to the lace trade, Nottingham report that, notwithstanding the continued depression, employers are of opinion that the position will improve considerably in the near future. Inquiries are being received which, it is anticipated, will result in good orders. The fear entertained in some quarters that the French lace manufacturers would carry the markets is now believed to be unfounded, as they are said to be much in the same position as English manufacturers, and to be liquidating stocks. In the hosiery trade orders for the home market are stated to be more numerous, but no substantial improvement can be looked for until the export trade revives. No change is to be recorded in regard to the wool textile, shoddy, and worsted trades. There is no substantial alteration in the boot and shoe trade ; on the whole, however, better time is being worked, and the improvement previously reported is being maintained.Transport. Transport work on the Clyde is abnormally quiet, and large numbers of dock labourers and seamen are out of employment. On the Mersey fewer ships are leaving and entering the docks than at any time since the war. The Atlantic passenger and general services have been considerably reduced, and a large number of passenger and freight steamers are laid up. Good hopes are entertained, however, of an expansion of business with the South American ports in the near future.No improvement is reported, in the London transport trade. At Grimsby a slight revival is reported, mainly as a result of the termination of the fishermen&apos;s strike.Miscellaneous. In the West Midlands Division unemployment is pronounced in. the engineering, metal, motor cycle, and nut and bolt trades, but the majority of the work-people engaged in the pottery and carpet trades are stated to be working full. time. In the North-Western Division the paper, chemical, tanning, hatting and wire industries are all affected by the general depression.The position of the fishing industry at Grimsby is now regarded as normal, but it is believed that, owing to the exceptionally low market price of fish, and the high cost of refitting, many firms are contemplating laying up their boats. At Fleetwood the outlook is regarded as very unfavourable ; the demand for fish has fallen off considerably and more than 45 steam-trawlers are laid up.In the Metropolitan area the scarcity of bricklayers and plasterers is adversely affecting the absorption of other building trades workers. The demand, for carpenters has slackened considerably, but there is a gradual improvement in the demand for painters. There is no improvement in the position of workers engaged in the engineering, printing, leather, metal and food products trades.Industrial I)evelopments.-&apos;KeiiQ\on report that Messrs. John Barker &amp; Co., Ltd., are taking over a portion of the Hanclley-Page works at Cricklewood for assembling motor-car bodies. At Ilkeston, preparations for the installation of a condenser plant, in connection with the manufacture of reinforced concrete pipes by the Stanton Iron Work Co., Ltd., have led to the employment of between 60 and 70 workers of the navvy type.
Labour Reductions. At Aberystwyth three lead mines have been closed, and over 60 men have been thrown out of employment. At Letchworth, Phcenix Motors, Ltd., have discharged 60 more workpeople, thus reducing their staff to 50, as compared with 500 three months ago. Dundee report that Messrs. J. Sharp &amp; Sons, Ltd., jute manufacturers, who normally employ about 800 workpeople, have closed down until March. At Smeth-wick, Messrs. Chance Bros. &amp; Co., Ltd., have discharged 200 men from their plate glass department, owing to the adverse rates of exchange, and the importation of Continental plate glass at a price lower than the (irm&apos;s own cost of production.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation. There is a small increase in the numbers of unemployed women and short-time workers, but the rate of increase is less than during past weeks. There are now well over half a million women unemployed or on systematic short time.Local Reports. In the North-Western Division reports from the textile districts bear evidence that the prolonged and. acute depression in the cotton industry is gradually becoming even worse. The live registers of most Exchanges continue abnormally high. At Burnley the number of totally unemployed women is 1,108, and there are 1,618 claims by short-time workers. At Bury the total number of current claims of both classes is over 6,000. Over 5,000 women are claiming benefit at Darwen, and at Nelson there are approximately 5,500 women claiming under the Mill Scheme, in addition to 2,500 totally unemployed. At Stockport the number of women unemployed and on short time is approximately 9,300.The situation in the textile industries in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division is still acute. Unemployment and short time are increasing. Other staple industries, such as wholesale clothing, hosiery and lace manufacture remain depressed. Bradford report that all mills are working reduced hours or are closed entirely. Brighouse report an abnormal, amount of short-time work in the textile trades.At Nottingham the lace trade is at a standstill. There is still a slight improvement in the making-up and hosiery trades in this town.The position in the South Midlands and Eastern Division remains unchanged. In the West Midlands Division there is also no sign of improvement. At Birmingham, Aston, Coventry and Smethwick serious and increasing unemployment is reported. Metal workers of all kinds, motor and cycle workers, rubber workers, silk workers, leather workers and tailoresses are all affected.The general unemployment prevalent in the manufacturing areas of London for many months past continues with little signs of improvement. The Exchanges in industrial areas continue to report heavy registers, varying from over 1,000 to nearly 5,000. The Great Marlborough Street Exchange, however, report that trade in the West End is increasing, and more dressmakers and tailoresses are being absorbed each week, although the highest class dressmakers continue to feel the effect of depression.The situation in the South-Western Division shows little change, wholesale tailoring, collar and shirt manufacture, and corset making still showing acute depression in such centres as Barnstaple, Bridgwater, Bristol, Swindon and Basingstoke.The general situation is unchanged in Wales, where unemployment does not appear to be seriously on the increase. In the Northern Division there is considerable depression. Over 500 claims to benefit are being made at Carlisle, and at Gateshead there is a register of over 700. Attention is already being paid in this division to the supply of seasonal workers for holiday resorts.In Scotland, reports point to the continued depression of all staple industries. At Aberdeen there are 1,000 women on the live register, in addition to 1,100 short-time workers. Heavy registers are also reported from the Glasgow Exchanges. At the Glasgow Exchange there are over 1,900 claims to unemployment insurance benefit, and at South Side there are 1.442 claims current. At Clydebank there are a number of metal machinists unemployed owing to discharges by the Singer Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Serious unem-ployment is notified from Dunfermline owing to depression in the linen industry, and from Dundee, where there is no improvement in the position of the jute industry.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Unemployment. The Workington Committee have succeeded, by means of a reso-lution forwarded to the Ministry of Transport, in obtaining the concession of workmen&apos;s fares for the employees of a local firm. The Scarborough Committee are protesting to the Town Council against the employment of female clerks when competent ex-Service(b 17042T) 2 H
* See p. 241 below.men are out of work. Eastbourne recommend that all local positions held by retired pensioners should be given to disabled or other ex-Service men. The Finchley Committee propose to invite local members of Parliament to attend a mass meeting of the unemployed. The Stirling Committee consider that the fixing of Trade Board rates of wages has increased unemployment by causing a reduction of staff.Unemployment Benefit. The Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) Amendment Bill, now before Parliament, increases the functions of Local Employment Committees in connection with the grant of further benefit. The Bill also meets the widely expressed view of the committees that additional benefits should be granted under the Act.*OUT-OF-WORK DONATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 17th February, show 392,983 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  363,459 11s. 8d.Unemployment Insurance. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 11th February was 895,838, involving an amount of  460,569 4s. 5d,DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme. Up to and including the 23rd February, 24,305 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 270,636 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller of the North-Western Division reports that during the past month efforts to re-settle disabled men in industry have been very severely hampered by the abnormal depression in industry. During the period, 323 men were placed in employment, but the Divisional Controller is of opinion that in the majority of cases these men were accepted by firms mainly out of sympathy, and as the result of persistent efforts on the part of the Departments special officers.The campaign in Liverpool, described in previous reports, has resulted in 158 disabled men being placed, out of 186 on the live register. Owing to this very satisfactory result, it has been decided to launch a similar campaign at Bootle. An initial meeting of employers and trade union leaders, convened by the Mayor, was held at the Town Hall on the 8th February, and decided to form a representative committee and to carry out an energetic campaign on behalf of unemployed disabled men. Every unemployed disabled man is to be summoned to the Town Hall for interview; the members of the committee are to interview employers not on the King&apos;s Roll; and a thorough publicity campaign is to be undertaken.JUVENILE BRANCH.Unemployed Juveniles: Courses of Instruction. After consultation with the Board of Education and the Scottish Education Department, Regulations under Section 7 (1) (v) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, have been issued. Under these Regulations, attendance at an approved course of instruction may be. required by an insurance officer as an additional condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit. So far as juveniles are concerned, local education authorities for higher education in England and Wales will be responsible for setting up courses, with the approval of the Board of Education. The Board have recently sent out a circular to these authorities explaining that, where there is need for such provision, and the scheme for classes meets with the approval of the Board, the expenses of the scheme may be taken into consideration in calculating the deficiency grant. When a course of instruction has been approved, juvenile workers who make direct claims for benefit will be required to attend it. Juveniles making claims through associations will not be required to attend, until the approval of the association concerned has been secured. Part-time workers will not, as a rule, be required to attend courses. It is anticipated that similar arrangements will shortly be made applicable in Scotland.Up to the present, in a considerable number of districts, special arrangements have been made for unemployed juveniles, in the form of classes or recreative centres, generally through the efforts of Juvenile&quot; Employment Committees. Considering that attendance at these centres has been voluntary, a fair measure of success has been attained, but it
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 18th February the Appointments Department placed 433 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 50,481. Of these, 6,811 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 769 ex-Service men and 14 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 18th February was 11,145 ex-Service men and 1,417 civilians. At the same date 940 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 487 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 18th February, the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 21 officers or men of similar educational qualifications, of which 11 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,169 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 49,555 for training of the type provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt with 27,784 applications, of which 23,287 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 22,163 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,338 cases.Business Training Scheme -During the week ending the 18th February, the Appoint-ments Department received 126 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 2,398, of which 610 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 517 cases. At the same date, 311 training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 68 having been registered during the week.The Director at Perth reports that the method employed in Glasgow of using the applicants as canvassers on their own behalf under the Business Training Scheme is proving successful. One man got into touch with three vacancies, one of which he accepted, and the other two have been registered with the department.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with a total of 1,079 cases, in 474 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 286 cases, and abandoned training in 46 ; 127 are still in training, and 90 are awaiting training.(b 17042T) 2 H 2has been found difficult to ensure regular attendance. In some cases it is probable that these informal centres will be taken over by the education authority and will be approved by the Board. Regular attendance will then be made a condition for the receipt of benefit.Where sufficient accommodation is available, Juvenile Employment Committees are being asked to use their influence to persuade boys and girls between 14 and 16, who are unemployed, to attend the classes. In their case there will be no inducement in the form of benefit, but the committees are being asked to consider whether some such inducement as priority in offers of employment can be held out to those who attend regularly at a centre.[Reference to matters of interest-to the Employment and Insurance Department unit also be found on pages 220, 222, 229, 231, 232 and 239 to 212.]
TRAINING DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 22nd February, 25,072 men were in training, as against 25,134 on the 15th February, and 25,063 on the 25th January. During the week 498 men were placed in training. There were 16,141 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 15th February and the 25th January being 16,145 and 16,083 respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 26,532, the totals for the 15th February and the 25th January being 25,972 and 24,732, respectively.The tendency to concentrate institutional training in Government Instructional Factories is being well maintained. Of 25,000 men in training on the 25th January, approxi-mately 10,000 were in Government Instructional Factories, ,6,000 in other institutional training centres, and 9,000 in employers&apos; workshops. There is again a slight falling-off in the numbers of men who are taking workshop training, due to the increasing difficulty in finding vacancies either for whole-time training or for the improvership period. In eight months the number of men in Government Instructional Factories, in round figures, has risen from 4,000 to 10,000, while the total of men training in other institutions has fallen from 10,000 to 6,000.Exhibitions. The second week of the Daily Mail Efficiency Exhibition has undoubtedly proved more successful than the first, particularly from the point of view of the Training Departments exhibit in the Annexe. It is expected that not less than 250 men will be placed in improverships, a number that may be increased considerably before the exhibition closes.Government Instructional Factories. During the past week there has been a net increase of 128 on the roil of men training in Government Instructional Factories, and the total increase since the 1st January is 1,038. The latest total of men training under factory conditions is 10,031. Including the Old Kent Road Factory, in which work was started on the 23rd February, when 44 men entered on a course of training in tailoring, there are now 62 centres of the factory type on the active list.The school practice scheme for the students at Sarisbury Court, which has been in progress for a month, is working very well. The Principal has received from the head teachers very satisfactory reports on the work of his students, who appreciate highly the break in the college routine, and are doing their utmost to make themselves useful in the schools.National Trade Advisory Committees : Boot and Shoe. At a meeting of the Adminis-trative Committee of the Boot and Shoe Trade Board, held on the 16th February, some 70 applications for training were approved, this being the final list which the committee are prepared to consider at the present time.National Trade Advisory Committees : Building. At a meeting on the 17th February, a recommendation to increase the Government Instructional Factory periods of training in masonry and wood machining from six to nine months was approved.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 23rd February, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 45,816 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 43,758 apprentices, employed by 17,412 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 19,351.Wages. Difficulty has arisen in the lace manufacturing industry in the South-Western area, from the failure of journeymen on piece-work to understand the special arrangements that have been made for their trade. As a result some of them appear to have paid their apprentices more, and others considerably less, than the amounts due to them. The matter, however, has been successfully explained to them, and, after considerable difficulty, local headquarters have apparently adjusted matters to the satisfaction of all concerned.Applications. Among the late applications are those of certain apprentices of a North of England firm, who filled up their application, forms, at their local Employment Exchange, but took no further action.  They believed that the arrangements would beAppointments and Training-continued.
completed by their union, who, however, did nothing. The men worked for a year under the impression that they were under the scheme, as they received from the firm the required proportion, three-quarters, of the prescribed rate. They only discovered their error at the close of what would have been the first half of their time under the scheme, when they applied for the increase to five-sixths of the prescribed rate, which was refused.  They are now renewing their applications.Non-Observancc of Conditions. At Edinburgh, certain plumbing firms continue to evade the financial obligations arising out of Lord Hunter&apos;s award. Difficulty is also reported in the plumbing industry at Glasgow, where there was a similar, though less prolonged, resistance by the employers to the adoption of the scheme. Their association agreed to accept it, after there had been a short strike, early in March, 1920. Nevertheless two firms, who have been among its bitterest opponents, suspended their apprentices, and are now putting obstacles in the way of their re-instatement. The matter will probably be referred to the Local Employment Committee.The long-continued refusal by Messrs. Black &amp; Son, Row, plumbers, to carry out their agreement has now come to an, end, and they have settled all the arrears. The settlement of their case required ten visits by local headquarters and between 40 and 50 letters.Progress of Training. Some excellent reports have been received. Messrs. Cowan, Sheldon &amp; Co., Ltd., Carlisle, engineers, brought 27 apprentices under the scheme, and in no case do they regret having done so, as the men all show great appreciation of the help given them by the firm and by the State, and their time-keeping and industry are admirable. Messrs. J. Coombe &amp; Son, Ltd.. Glasgow, heating and ventilating engineers, report that their business throws the apprentices largely on their own initiative, as they are employed mainly in large houses with very little supervision. Nevertheless, not a single complaint has been received from customers in regard to their work.Unemployment. Local headquarters for Wales report an. increase in the number of apprentices under the scheme who are on short time or entirely unemployed. At Wey-mouth, it is feared that many engineering apprentices will soon be unemployed, as the Whitehead Torpedo Works (Weymouth), Ltd., will close shortly owing to lack of orders. Probably only a few apprentices under the scheme will be affected, since the firm have brought very few under it. It is to be feared, however, that a number of returned apprentices who have not been accepted by the firm will also be out of employment.Institutional Training. Sanction has been received for an engineering class at the Central School of Technology at Stoke-on-Trent. This class will provide weekly about .15 hours of workshop training, 6 hours per week of machine drawing, and 6 of applied mechanics, mathematics and workshop calculations. A class is also being organised at Birmingham for 20 or 30 students, and it is hoped that sanction for this will soon be secured. Local headquarters hope that these classes will absorb the apprentices at present unem-ployed, except for a few dental mechanics and one bookbinder, on whose behalf further efforts ai&apos;e being made. Sanction has also been given for a second class in engineering at Paisley, and 21 apprentices will enrol on the 14th March. In addition, a few apprentices from the first class, who did badly at the Christmas examination, are being transferred to the second for further training. Sanction has also been given for a second class at the Robert Gordon Technical Institute at Aberdeen, and provisional sanction for an engineering class at Oldham.General Training.Apprenticeship (Building). In the North of England, further progress with the national scheme is reported both in Cleveland and Cumberland. In the former district, definite proposals have been made for a meeting of employers for the whole district on the 23rd March, and it is hoped that this will expedite appreciably the adoption of the scheme, and the establishment of local committees throughout the district. In Cumberland, a joint conference of representatives of the industry at Penrith has referred the scheme back to the various associations, with a recommendation in favour of the immediate establishment of a local apprenticeship committee. It is hoped shortly to arrange other joint conferences at Workington, Whitehaven, Kendal and some smaller places.In the West Midlands a joint conference has been definitely arranged at Redditch; and progress is reported in several other districts. At Leek and Sutton Coldfield the attitude of both sides is favourable; at Wellington, the operatives&apos; secretary has undertaken to
bring the matter before his federation, and subsequently to approach the employers, who have hitherto been hostile to the scheme. At Kidderminster, on the other hand, the operatives, whilst favourable to the scheme, refuse to discuss it with the employers till a local dispute is settled. At Dudley, there appears to be little desire on either side to fall into line, the view being held that no special organisation is required for the few apprentices who are entering the industry locally.  Some progress has been made at Hinckley.A very successful joint conference has been held at Wellingborough, at which representatives of the industry at Northampton, Kettering and Rushden were also present. It is expected that in all four towns local committees will soon be established. If so, Peterborough will be the only important town in Northamptonshire without a committee ; and here also progress is reported. In Kent, the Chatham Master Builders&apos; Association have decided to adopt the scheme for the whole Medway district, which includes also Rochester, Gillingham, Sittingbourne, Stiood and Maidstone.Trade Board Wages Rates and Apprenticeship (Wales), Complaints are reported from Swansea, that apprentices&apos; rates are being fixed by the Boards which are too high, and are likely to have disastrous effects on the industries concerned. In tailoring, for instance, there are very few British apprentices, and the whole trade is said to be passing into the hands of foreigners. A similar tendency to dispense with apprentices is stated to be appearing in other industries affected.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 229 and 236. j
APPENDIX.QUESTIONS  in PARLIAMENT.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Unemployment: Ireland.Mr. Pennefather asked the Chief Secretary for Ireland whether there is any serious amount of unemployment in Ireland ; and, if so, whether any steps are being taken to deal with it generally, and, if not, for what reason.Dr. Macnamara: I have been asked to reply. On the 4th February there were 54,404 men and 24,972 women registered at the Employment Exchanges in Ireland as wholly unemployed. There were also 44,440 persons drawing unemployment benefit or out-of-work donation during short-time working. There are of course other short-time workers not receiving benefit or donation. In view of the conditions prevailing in Ireland, special grants for works there have been made from time to time during the last three years primarily for the purpose of providing employment for ex-Service men. These grants, which total  515,000, have been administered by the Chief Secretary of Ireland. In addition, local authorities in Ireland may make application to the Unemployment Grants Committee for contributions to approved works. The payment of unemployment benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act and of out-of-work donation to ex-Service men applies, of course, to Ireland.   (21st February.)Trade Board Rates.Sir K. Fraser asked the Minister of Labour whether he is aware that, in spite of the fact that the cost of living is declining, some of the Trade Boards are proposing to increase the existing minimum rates, the effect of which will be further to increase unemployment.Dr. Macnamara: No Trade Board has passed any substantial proposal to increase rates of wages since November last, when the Ready-made and Wholesale Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board passed the proposal to which I refer in my answer to another question of my hon. and gallant friend. A number of proposals, however, issued before that date, are still under consideration by various Trade Boards which, when the proposals came before them, in due course, after the expiry of the period of two months provided by the Acts for public advertisement, agreed to postpone any decision. The general charge that Trade Board Orders have caused considerable unemployment has been frequently made. I have invariably asked for examples, and I have myself caused inquiries to be made into any specific cases to which my attention has been drawn. With the exception of certain juveniles in the dressmaking and millinery trades, I have not received specific cases bearing out the allegations, and, in fact, the learners&apos; rates in the dressmaking and millinery trades are being revised by the Trade Boards concerned.   (23rd February.)DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT.Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) Amendment Bill.In moving the Second Reading of this Bill on the 23rd February, the Minister of Labour gave a further explanation of its provisions. Those entitled by their qualifying period of employment to receive 16 weeks&apos; benefit before the end of October, 1921, required no further qualification to receive the following 16 weeks&apos; benefit before the beginning of July, 1922. Ex-Service men who had not exhausted their original out-of-work donation policies would be entitled to do so ; those who were entitled to donation under the Special Extension Scheme in operation would continue to draw it until the extension expired on the 31st March, and would then receive benefit under the new Bill.After July, 1922, the permanent provision would come into force which gave 26 weeks&apos; benefit in the year instead of 15. The increased contributions levied after the 4th July, 1921, would be, in the case of men, 5d. from the employed person, 6cZ. from the employer, and 2fd!. from the State ; in the case of women, the corresponding contributions would be
* See this Repoit, Vol. II., No. 20, 14th November, p. 553.4ci, bd., and 2%d., respectively ; in the case of boys, 2\d., 3d., and lfc .; and in the case of girls, 2d., 2\d. and \\d. The benefits to be provided were considerably greater than could be met, under the abnormal conditions of unemployment which prevailed, by this increase in contributions; it was proposed, therefore, to draw on the Unemployment Insurance Fund. On an average of 9h per cent, of unemployment among insured persons, it was estimated that the accumulated, balance of the Fund, which stood at over  20,000,000, would be reduced by the beginning of July, 1922, to between  4,000,000 and  5,000,000. The Minister pointed out the difficulties in the way of differentiating between single and married men as regards the amount of benefit, and hoped that this point would not be pressed. He gave an account of the enormous burden of work laid upon the Employment Exchanges during the past six months by the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and expressed his thanks to the staff for their zeal and devotion.The main criticism of the Bill in the ensuing debate turned on the question of the amount of benefit.   The Bill passed the Second Reading by 148 votes to 50.In the Committee stage, on the 24th February, Mr. Clynes moved an amendment fixing the rate of benefit at 40s. for the head of a family, 25s. for others, and 5s. for each dependant. It would be necessary to strengthen the Regulations to prevent shirking work ; organised labour and the employers could be of very great assistance. He pressed the change on the ground that, even before the war, the barest living wage was put at 30s. a week, and that 40s. hoav was not worth more than 15s. before the war. The Government, if necessary, should draw upon future reserves to cover the acute period of trade depression. The Minister of Labour pointed out that the amendment would make the present Fund hopelessly bankrupt, and that to mortgage the credit of the State would widen the gap between real and nominal money values. Mr. T. Thomson, Sir D. Maclean, Mr. Barnes and other members appealed to the Government to increase the benefit for men to 20s., even if it proved necessary to exhaust the Unemployment Fund completely by the beginning of July, .1922, to do so. The Minister pointed out the risk that unemploy-ment might exceed the percentage on which the Bill wras based, in which case a deficiency would have to be met; but on behalf of the Government he accepted this suggestion. An amendment in the name of Mr. T. Thomson was consequently accepted, raising the rate of benefit to 20s. for men, and a subsequent amendment raised the rate for women to 16s. Amendments proposing the equalisation of benefit for men and women, and the grant of benefit for dependent children, were not accepted.An amendment was moved by Mr. J. H. Thomas and accepted, involving an alteration of the wording of the First Schedule of the principal Act, bringing within the term &quot;excepted employment&quot; persons concerning-whom the Minister is satisfied that &quot;the employment is, in his opinion, having regard to the normal practice of the employer, permanent in character, that the employed person has completed three years&apos; service in the employment, and that the other circumstances of his employment make it unnecessary that he should be insured under this Act.&quot; The main effect of the amendment is to bring railway men under the term &quot; excepted employment.&quot;*
