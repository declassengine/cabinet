Secretary, Cabinet SecretariatMANDATES. 1*    Mr, Balfour explained that he understood&quot; that: the .-. -: Secretariat oomplained that the &quot;A&quot; Mandates as communicated to the Council were in some respects not in accordance -with Article 22 of the Cbvehant.Qne of the complaints&apos;was that the mandatory was given power of direct action instead of being limited to indirect action, y.i^:--&apos; t&amp;e&quot;giVirig&apos;of&apos; advio-e and assistance as o^ntompjy^ed by.;the Pact.    ;It was understood that tho::. &apos; Frenoh were Inclined::to- support this view and took the line that these mandates, should be regarded as interim :. mandates pending the drawing up of the Organic Law which ..... should be submitted,to the Council who could then, ifthey  ., saw fit, endeavour to secure the alteration of the mandates : so as to bring them In^o .more pomplete harmony with the.Pact,.
In M-Co Balfour1 3 view this was rather a dangerous doctrine and he was not at all sure whether it could be legally sustained It was considered that if too much stress was laid&apos; on the words of the Covenant it would be impossible for the mandatory power-to make the mandate work: satisfactorily; for instance, the mandatory was responsible for se.oar:!.ns; religious tolerance and freedom of action for missionaries.     It would be difficult for the mandatory to ensure this if his action were limited to that of giving advice and assistance whioh. the, local government might or might not, carry out,The question was then considered whether it was really necessary that the &quot;A&quot; mandates should be dealt with at the next meeting of the- Council, or whether it would not be better to defer this question to a subsequeiio meeting of the Council. It was felt that, although - the- Italians had recently withdrawn the reservations they made at Geneva in the hope that they would secure inclusion of the Tripartite Agreement in the Treaty of Sevres, their Representative on the Council might still make difficulties so long as no decision had been come to on the latter point by the Conference an London.     Moreover, tho See-retary of State, for tho&apos;Colonies&apos;was shortly going to Egypt to confer with, the British Repr.eseii-f.itives in Palestine and Mo^po-tamia, and was anxious to have time to consider the situation more fully., in consultation;, with these authorities.,&apos;  -It.was realised -that the French wore very.anxious to get the&apos; -Syrian mandate approved by the Council in order to. replace their military administration by a civil government and to reduce their expenditure in that part of the world.The Conference came to the. conclusion that. while there was no objection to the French Syrian mandate being passed, it would&apos;be better to defer the attempt to secure the passing of the British mandates to a subsequent meeting of the Council,
2.,        Mr. Balfour dre^ attention to the wording of Article 22 which lays down the prohibition of abuses such as Slavery, Liquor Traffic and the Arms Traffic, and explained that the ordinary, meaning of those words implied the prohibition of the Liquor Traffic; and he foreshadowed great difficulties with all the Aborigines ?rotection Societies and other like-minded people who would feel in this oace that their contentions were backed by the obvious moaning of the English.It was pointed out that prohibition in this case referred to the prohibition of abuses rather than to the prohibition of the Liquor Traffic as such,    This&apos; argument was emphasised by pointing out that there was no intention to prohibit anybody from having a gun to protect himself or his property from marauding wild beasts, and that while slavery was undeniably an abuse the Arms Traffic was only an abuse in certain circumstances that it was absurd to say that no native should in any circumstances&apos; have liquor, and that antf attempt to enforce this would give rise to grave disturbances., both among the native troops and others, and that it was important to try to make it clear, if the question was raised at the Council, that the intention of the Covenant was to prohibit the abu j9 of the Liquor Ig&amp;aff&apos;io*3. It was ascertained that what the Colonial office were afraid of was the possible demands that might be made as regards the Eastern Malay States by the Advisory Committee which is to be set up^     It was pointed out, however,,, that neither the Assembly nor the Council had any power to alter the existing Convention or to make a new one.    The Colonial Office expressed themselvessatisfied/-3w
satisfied provided the&quot; British Representative on this Commission was instructed to take into special account the interests of the Eastern Malay States in this question.USE OF BLAXflf-&apos; 4.* This question was briefly touched upen and TROOPSOTJTSIDE        &apos; the general sense b? the Conference was that there AFRICA iwas no&apos;advantage in pressing -fo&apos;r&apos;i definite recognition of the right to use native troops in Africa Outside Africa for purposes cf defence, and that the question might be allowed to rest in its present position until some emergency arose *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.
