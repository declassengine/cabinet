At present the miners wil not accept district rates of wages but there is to be a national Conference of Delegates before any action is taken.Revolutionary elements among miners and engineers are very activ and the Red International of Trade Unions is spreading.Details are given of an important secret meeting between the Communists and the Shop Stewards held recently in London.The Cnruiiunist Party is circulating an alleged secret circular from the Mines Department, with which the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has worked much mischief.An attempt to raise money for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; from the Nuneaton Co-operative Society was defeated by an overwhelming majority, though it has a bank balance of  50,000.The Russian Trading Delegation has a bank balance in England of  480,u03.   Klishko has lately issued a bearer cheque for  18,000; enquiries as to the destination of this money are proceeding.It is now known that Sinn Pein sabotage in England and Scotland is directed from Dublin.       .There was no improvement in the state of the Provinces in Irelan There have been ambushes with loss of life on both sides and a numberof/
of isolated murders of soldiers in Cork.   Anong the papers seized in Dublin was a confidential statement showing that the ten million dollar loan in America yielded less than five million, and of this only 650,000 dollars have reached Ireland. The &quot;Finance Minister&quot; reports a balance in hand on tho 31st December last of  588,471, 4. 8., but out of this  380,900 is in the United States and is probably unrealisable.
TH5 COAL MIN5RSThe question of de-control of the coal mines may well become the turning point in the industrial situation.   The miners as a whole are strongly opposed to de-control because they think it must entail the abolition of a national wage rate.   They are prepared to stako everything on the unification of the industry because if lower rates be applied to the lessiprofitable coal fields a national downward grading will inevitably follow.   They feel that the coal owners will not agree to any kind of pooling system when they have regained financial control.   Heavy losses are being incurred in many pits and there seems to be no prospect of an immediate revival in tha export trade.   According to a statement made by Mr. Frank Bodges, no further meeting between the Federation and the owners will take.place until a Delegate Conference has been held.Consternation has been caused by the announcement that the owners have decided to gi&quot;?e a fortnight&apos;s notice to end contracts as from March 31st.   This is taken to mean that unless the men submit to a big reduction in wages there will be a lock-out as from A^april 14th.Though there is little likelihood of a national general strike it must not be assumed that a strike is impossible.   If it takes place the railwaymen and transport workers will probably be requested to declare coal &quot;black&quot;, thereby making accumulated stocks practically useless.   Moreover, in their present ugly temper the miners will listen readily $q the advice of revolutionaries to seize the mines and the means of subsistence.   It must also be remembered that,under the recent agreement with the engineers the Foderation has power to.withdraw the engine, pump and firemen, and there is, therefore, the risk that the mines may be flooded before it is possible to arrangefor/
for any substituted labour.The men still believe that during the period of oontrol the owners have worked the more difficult seams, leaving the richer ones for later development.Meanwhile, both the owners and the miners appear to look upon de-control as a breach of faith.   It is probable that the miners&apos; grievances will be ventilated in the House of Commons very soon.In South Wales about 80,000 mine workers are unemployed or working short time.   Many of the men regard a reduction of wages as; inevitable.   The steadier ones are waiting a lead from their officials and some of them allege that the slump has been . artificially organised.The Lancashire miners believe that a very serious crisis is approaching. and at present they do not apoear willing to give way without a struggle.   They are bitterly opposed to decontrol and to district rates and they say that as soon as profits cease to be pooled many of the Lancashire mines will be closed unless the miners acoeot a very large reduction, in wages.   In Wigan the Pearson and JCnowles Coal and Iron Company have given notice to their men that after fourteen days they will be engaged on day to day contracts.   The Company says that it is working at a serious loss and when the Government financial guarantee is reraov it will be impossible to continue operations.   6,000 men will be affected. .  ....In Northumberland and Durham the men do not want to strike but at present they will not accept a. reduction in wages without a fight. . In some, sections of these coal fields revolutionary doctrine has a firm hold and such remarks as the following are frequently heard.:- , &quot;If the owners are looking for trouble they will get it.&quot; . &quot;We will smash the shafts for them.&quot;   &quot;We willnot/
not starve as long as there is anything left in the shopsor the store.&quot;   The older men are anxiously awaiting the rosultof the negotiations.THE RED INTERNATIONAL OF TRADE unions on February 23rd an important seoret meeting of tho sub-committees of the Communist Party of Groat Britain and the National Administrative Council of Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committees was hold in London: the latter body is, in effect, an integral part of &quot;the Red International of Trade Unions. There were present W. J, Kirker, J. McDonald, A* MacManus, W. Mellor (Industrial Editor, of, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;) and A. Inkpin, representing the Communist Party, while George Peet, Jack Tanner and T-. Kime represented the shop stewards.The ohairman, Mellor, stated that the object of the meeting was to ascertain exactly where the shop stewards movement stood in relation to the communists:   what its activities were and what steps could be taken to bring about closer relationships between the two bodies.T. Kinie then read a report of his Council, in which stresswas laid upon the necessity for close co-operation;&quot;The individual members of the. shop stewards&apos; and workers&apos; committees will come under the discipline of the Communist Party as members of that organisation and the shop stewards and workers committees will come under the discipline of the Red International of Trado and Industrial Unions.   The above position will,remain good until the International Congress of Red Unions takes place,&quot;After; discussion the chairman drafted the followingresolution, which was unanimously passed:&quot;That this joint: Committee of representatives of the Communist Party of Great Britain and -the National Administrative&apos;Council of the Shpp Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committees agrees on need for closest co-operation between communist party on one hand, and. workers&apos;. oommittee on the other, H      &apos;&quot;It agrees that need for national unofficial industrial movement is urgent and every effort should be made to secure that the control of the movement should be in the hands of the members of Communist Part;/ of Gt. Britain.   It holds that Communist Party must control directly activities of
. all members of the party taking part in this national movement and it is the duty of all members of trie party to work under the direction of the HLxecutive Committee of the party.&quot;It maintains that it is the duty of the  . unofficial industrial movement (a) to work within the existing trade union movement with the object of recreating that mevtaaent on industrial lines (b) to take part in all mass movements in industry and to seizo suoh opportunities as arise that tend towards revolution (c) to work for the allegiance fj of the trade union movement being transferred from the Amsterdam to the Red International.&quot;It is the business of the Communist Party to . cocure that all .key positions are held by communists and for all oommunists working within the industrial , movement to endeavour to secure the conversion of the rank and file to gommunism and the complete subordinati of the&apos; industrial movement to the Communist Party of St. Britain.&quot; , .; , , ..The/minutes of the meeting continue:&quot;In the course of the discussion A. MacManus had ;raised question of the need for organising definite ooirmunist groups in the ICrade Unions for conoentrated work nationally and locally within those unions. It was agreed that MacManus* should prepare a statement on the subject and submit it for consideration by Communist Party executive and national administrative council of shop stewards in order that those bodies should instruct their delegates on the subject for a further meeting to be held before March 31st.&quot;It was understood that there were other revolutionary industrial-bodies suoh as the Workers&apos; ^International Industrial Union apart from and working j &apos; on entirely different lines from&apos; the shop stewards  committee and it was agreed that the party executivo :&quot;   was free to approach these bodies in the same way that \ it had apprcached the sh&amp;p stewards  committee with a view to bringing all revolutionary industrial activity in this country undor the central directing control of the communist party.*&apos;The question was raised on the relations of the shop stewards&apos; oomraittee papers (&quot;Solidarity^ and the &quot;worker&quot;) to the communist party and the party organ &quot;The Communist&quot; and steps that the party&apos;might take to assist the workers&apos; committee papers.   Referenoe was made to, the looseness of control as regards&apos; the &quot;Worker and it: was stated that before the. Communist Party executive oould do anything to assist the papers their ; control should be vested in. a- body such as the National ^Administrative Council with, whom tho party could deal. At the same time the party delegates agreed to ask the executive to consider the issuing sfa statement to the branches requesting them to take up and push the sale o &quot;?ha-&apos;workar&apos;f and &quot;Solidarity&quot;.&apos;&quot;Party/      i
&quot;Party delegates also agreed to raise with the executive the question of financial assistance to enable the National Administrative Council to send someone to Liverpool in connection with propaganda and organising work there amongst the Seamen and Fir emen.&quot;^EMPLOYMENT ..Although the upward curve of unemployment appears to be flattening, the total oontinuec to inorease:   the London Distriot Council of &quot;unemployables&quot; maintains its activities and there are   indications that the communists are taking a hand in organisation.   In North Kensington, for instance, -efforts are being made under the direction of Ryan, who is stated to bo a member of the Irish Republican Array, to organise the unemployed on the basis of a constitution, charter and rules, whioh bear the obvious stamp of communist draughtmanship.   The suggested raid on the Harbury Rooms, Ladbroke Grove, has not, however, been executed, owing to the police protection afforded.A Women&apos;s Unemployed Committee has been formed atEdmonton, for the registration and organisation of the local women who are out of work. The men&apos;8 committee has resigned owing to disagreement3 and a new one is being formed.Tho Cambeiwcll &quot;unemployables&quot; intend, to ask the Minister of Labour to reooive a deputation: in this district also the women are being specially organised.   Fanning,, who was until recently the organiser for Camberwell, and Scott, of the Communist Party, visited Doptford on February 26th and 27th with a view to securing the leadership of the men in that   .( &apos; *  &apos; * -   i f l&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;; jt * v &quot; . &apos;;distriot.   Their efforts have,,so far, proved unavailing owing to the influence of tho Weslevan,Minister, whc has placed hall at tho disposal&apos;of the unemployed and has appealed to them, successfully, to discard their red badges and substitute - the national colours. On/
. On February goth members of the Eerrnondsey and    &apos; Rotherhithe -unemployed organisation seized Herolds Institute in Drummondr^oad. but abandoned possession upon the arrival of the police.The premises ot 97, Pookham Road, whioh the unemployed have been using for some time, have been badly damaged by them; the damago being estimated at between  200 and  300. Practically the whole of the woodwork has been torn down and burnt; fittings and lead piping stripped and sold, and marble raantelpieoos wilfully broken.In Lancashire and Cheshire the industrial situation is reported to &quot;be going from bad to worse&quot;.   Liverpool is hardest hit:   70 vessels lay idle last week owing to trade depression. -About 20 vessels are under repair, a process which is impeded by the BhipJoiners&apos; strike.   Seafaring men and dbelters aro particularly affected by the slump and :;any ships are s aid still to be diverted to the Continent forrepaire. In Manchester and the whole of the cotton district a deplorable state of affairs is prevalent.   The position of-engineers- in Oponshaw is-serious; workers in the painting, paper, chemical, hatting, wire and tanning trades are being suspended in increasing numbers and the fish industry is also involved.In Northumberland and Durham unemployment is ihereasing. In the Sunderland area, trade h&amp;s not been so bad since 1907, while in the Middlesboro&apos; district there are nearly 10,000 unemployed as against 500 in September last.   In these counties the unemployed are, as yet, unorganised and undemonstrative.From Yorkshire my o or respondent reports that the unemployed are just able to oarry on with the help of doles, union benefit and savings. &quot;&quot;&quot;There were further increases in the number of totallyunemployed/
unemployed and of short time workers in Coventry last week: the motor engineering trade is chiefly affected and there is a general feeling cf gloom in the city.   It is stated that John Minto, the secretary of the Leicester Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee, was offered work at  6 per week.   This he refused &apos;bn principle&quot;.The activities of the Glasgow &quot;unemployables&quot; have assumed grave dimensions:   judging from the attendance at meetings their members do not greatly exceed 3,000, but they are quite irresponsible and, under the influence of John McLean and his lieutenants, will no doubt beoome disorderly in the near future. Their attention has latterly been focussed upon the forthcoming visit of the Prince of Wales, but a hostile demonstration in that connection would react&apos;most unfavourably upon thorn.Wild speeohes have been made during the week by John McLean and &quot;Sandy&quot; Ross*   The former is under the ircpression that his arrest is imminent but states that &quot;the authorities will have their work cut out&quot; as he has thousands of unemployed behind him.McLean is a aid to have forwarded to Moscow a report from tho &quot;leaders of British Communism&quot; in which promises are given that:&quot;The unemployed shall be united into a solid organisation for the purpose of vigorous agitation, such agitation to take violent forms if necessary&quot;; and   &apos;*The British unemployed workers, so soon as they are sufficiently organised, shall join tho International Federation of Unemployed now in process of formation.&quot;REVOLUTIONARY FORCES WITHIN .TRE AMALGAMATED ENGINEERING UNION -.......   ^^^^^^ *A consolidation cf the revolutionary elements within the Amalgamated Engineering Union is in progress: this is due in large measure to the activities of the Red International.of Trade Unions and of the shop stewards.   The doctrine of industrial unionism, which has been consistently taught by&apos;Tom Mann, is also beginning to take ,effect.   It is a significant fact that more branches ofthe/
the Amalgamated Engineering Union than of any other trade union have passed the re&amp;olutions of the Rod International of Trade Unions and that efforts are being made to -alter the rules of constitution by the &quot;Amalgamated Engineering Union Committee of the Advocates of Socialist Industrial Unionism.&quot; This body has issued a suggested alteration of the preface and initiatory address of the   Amalgamated Engineering Union, in which it is declared that &quot;The immediate fights over hours, wages, etc, must be viewed as the preliminary work of.&quot; preparing, testing and final completion of the requisite working class organisation, knowledge and experience in Socialist Industrial Administration.   That is the mission of I the working class.   The aim and object of tho Amalgamated Engineering Union is to work for the realisation of the Socialist Industrial Republic.&quot;On February 26th a meeting of rebel groups of engineers was held at Glasgow, about forty delegates representing branches of the union in Greenock, Gourock,&apos; Dumbarton, Vale&apos;1 Leven, Bowhill, Renfrew, Dalrauir, Clydebank, Paisley, South Side and East End .of Glasgow.   Jarces Uess presided and it m explained that the conference had been called for the purpoa of making the Amalgamated Engineering Union a revolutionary body.   The first step was to alter the initiatory address arj the next an educational policy for members.   To attain this latter end, it was proposed to make a levy of 3d. per raembef per annum and to form a committee of &quot;confirmed revolutions in order to ensure that Marxian economics only would be tan The secretary stated that he had corresponded with the Cent; labour College and the Scottish labour College on the subj of classes.   It is worthy of note that Leonard, the secret of the Scottish Labour College, is the local organiser of Red International of Trade Unions.A further conference of rebel members of, the Amalgams! 11Engines!
Engineering Union will be held in a fortnight&apos;8 time.   Branches are about to be formed at Burnley, Birmingham, Luton and York, and it is hoped to link them up with the Scottish groups.   They aim at the disruption of the union from within, in accordance with the principles laid down by Moscow.WAGE REDUCTIONSIt seems probable that the more powerful unions will endeavour shortly to make a stand against threatened wagereductions.   Their attitude must, of necessity, be temperedby unemployment, but it is unlikely, for instance, that the engineers will accept without a strugglet the suggestedreduction of 12^ on day work and 7^$ on piece work.   Thesmaller unions are in some measure resigned to an event whichthey have come to regard as inevitable, but the feeling is\       bitter. , Their attitude was aptly expressed by, a Coventryalderman, who said that the workers were entitled to say to theemployers\   &quot;How muoh sacrifice are you going to make?   Bcwmuch of the plunder oil the war, which ranged from 20 to 2,000$are you going to give up to meet the situation?&quot;Strikes against reduction of wages are in progress inIondo4,.,Eltham, Scotland, West Bromwich, Sinethwick, Wolverhamptonand Darlaston:   in regard to the strike of nut and bolt*workersin the above Black Country towns, the reduction is one of 10s.per week.   This brings the wages of the women to 29s., a figure which, given present prices, is obviously below the level onwhich they could maintain a decent existence.It seems likely that resistance to reduced wages will be offered by miners, engineers,&apos; shipbuilders and   transportwprkers including railwaymen.&apos; ,THE C0&amp;3MUNISTS &apos;&quot;    1&quot; 1&quot;......1 .........i&apos;&apos;During the week London and, in some oases, provincial ooramunist meetings have concentrated upon opposition to , Parliamentary/
Parliamentary action and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald.   Francis Meynellspoke at a meeting of about 000 in Woolwich on February 27thand stated that he left tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot; because he &quot;foundout the Maodonalds.&quot;   On the same day, a Manchester meeting was addressed by Robinson, of the Glasgow Communist Party, who said;&quot;We are  a revolutionary party, we do not believe in Parliamentary action, we do not believe in constitutional methods.   We do not think you can get your emancipation by simply sending Labour members to Parliament,   Your so-called Labour leaders tell you you can get all you want by Parliamentary action, by simply putting a cross on a ballot paper.   Well, you ought to know. ... Your leaders tell you constitutional action is the thing and that you can get all you need by constitutional action.   Well now, in . Churohillian language, I say that is a terminological inexactitude - in other words, it is a bloody lie. ... The: was no unemployment when you were spilling your blood over in France and on the other battle fields but there is plant now, and what does Parliament offer you, what does Parliament offer you to keep you from starvation?   There ai 1^- millions of workers unemployed in this country at presei and the indications are that things will be much worse yet, The tide has not yet turned.   They give you a miserable dol of 15s. a week to keep your wife and family on.   That is parliamentary action for you.   That is what it has done for you.   It has been tried and it has proved a bloody failure, and yet some of you seem content to stand it, at any rate you do stand it.   You are apparently content to allow your wife and family to starve.   Why even the lowest animal in creation will fight like hell to defend its offspring. The only creatures who are content to watch their offspring starve and die, are men and women.   I cannot understand the psychology of a man who will allow his wife and children to starve whilst there is nothing more than a Olate glass window between him and the food which they require to keep them from starvation ... We are out for the establishment o a Workers&apos; Federal Communist Republic, ... You have got to choose whioh side you are to be on because the great fight is&apos;coming and coming soon.   Then you will have to decide. Why not decide now?&quot;On February 27th a Coventry meeting held under the auspices of the Reconstruction Society passed a resolution emphatically protesting against the publication of revolutionary papers such as the &quot;Red Dawn&quot; and &quot;The Socialist&quot;, and demanding their immediate suspension.It is reported that headquarters of the Communist Party of Great Britain are prepared to pay the expenses of Parliamentary candidates for Coventry and Leicester, should vaoancies occur.The Glasgow Communist Group has decided to circularise allcommunists/
oomnranists who are opposed to Parliamentary action with a viewto the formation of an anti-parliamentary centre.The revolutionary elements in Dundee appear to have adoptedmilitant tactios.   On February 16th a public meeting convenedby a patriotic society was pecked by extremists to the number cf *about 500.   In about twenty minutes, the meeting had been broken up.   Detonators or small bombs were fired, and at the conclusion pistols were fired on the staircase.   The next day. one of the same soo&amp;kers was knocked off his platform and sustained injury. The &quot;unemployed&quot; in this city seem&apos;  to have oome under the domination of the communists.OOMMUSIST PARTY AND &quot;SECRET CILOCTJLRS11I am able to give an instan.ee of the mischievous activity of the Communist Party of Great Britain in industrial matters. The Party is sending out, officially, &quot;a copy of the secret circular issued from the Mines Department to Coal Mine Owners, which may be of service to you in your propaganda in the division.&quot;   The wording of the alleged &quot;secret circular&quot; is similar to that published in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of February  2nd an^ with whioh that paper has worked very considerable harm:jtjne starred paragraph, which is net unimportant, was omitted by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.&quot;Mines Department, Victoria St.,London, S.W.I.&apos;Form L, 1354 1st February, 1921.Sir,I am directed by the Secretary of Mines to invite your attention to the following points in connection with the temporary stoppage of pits owing to lack of trade.(l)   On the Question of&quot;working short time.   Owners should bo guided by the same principle as if they were not subject to control.^Where men are rendered idle and cannot be absorbed elsewhere, arrangements should be made, as far as it is practicable/
practicable, and in consultation with the men&apos;s representatives, to enable all the men to share in the work available.(2)   The complete stoppage of pits may fall into two categories, (a) stoppage of one or more of the pits in an undertaking in order to concentrato on the remainder of the pits in a colliery undertaking; (b) stoppage of single pits not part of a large undertaking.As regards (a,) the owners should be guidod as in (l).   As regards (b) the matter should be submitted to the department with a statement of the reasons for wishing to close and showing whether pumping will be continued, the number of men unemployed, and the extent to which these men can be absorbed in other undertakings.(3)   In case of temporary stoppage   War wage is payablo to the men so rendorod idle up to a maximum of 14 days, providing that they are not in receipt of unemployment benefit.Mr. Bridgeman will be grateful if you will communicate the above direction to the Owners in-your district.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,     ,(Signed)    A. E. Gowers. The Secretary&quot;. v.CONVICTIONOn February 25th William Gallachor was sentenced at Birmingham to throe months&apos; imprisonment in the Second Division for attempting to cause sedition among the ,Civil copulation.&quot;DAILY REJRALD&quot;&quot;On April 15th the &apos;Daily Herald&apos; will enter on the tenth year of its existence&quot; wrote Lansbury in a recent issue, and asked all readers and supporters to make, the paper a birthday present of money.   He suggested that a . &quot;Shilling Fund&quot; be started and added that any sums would, be received on and after February 28th.On/
On February 14th John Scurr addressed a meeting of Nuneaton Co-operators, wno were asked to invest  100 in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;. An overwhelming majority refused, amid angry shouts, to pass the resolution, although the Nuneaton Co-operative Society has a bank balance of  60,000.ISM FEIN IN GREAT BRITAIN . fDuring the week Sinn Fein aotivity in this country has been confined in the main to propaganda:   many meetings have been heldin the Metropolis by the Irish Self-Determination League and these have been enthusiastic and well attended.   It is reported that theLeague is now strong enough, financially, to send money to Ireland.Several apparent strangers heve been observed to visit^Sinn Feinoffices in London.On March 6th a meeting of the Central Executive Council ofthe Irish Self-Determination League will be held in Manchester;interest attaches&quot;to two of the motions which figure on the agenda.&quot;(1) That an occupational census be at once taken of all members of the Irish Self-Determination League between the ages of 15 years and 50 years.(Z)    That the Irish Self-Determination League Executive take immediate steps to organise Labour inside the ranks of the League so that the Executive may be able to direct the aotion and utilise tho power of the members in the various unions.&quot;On February 26th the house of Councillor R, Purcell in Plumstead was raided by the police and certain documents removed.The meetings addressed bjr Dr. Meant: in Scotland are reported to have been most successful from the Sinn Fein point of view: all were largely attended and there was no disorder.   Numbers&apos;of olerios were present on each occasion, also, it is stated, correspondents of foreign newspapers.There is a report, as yet unconfirmed, that Sinn Feiners are drilling under a convent in the Greenhill district of Swansea.IRELAND/
ireland there was no improvement in the state of toe provinces during the week:   the number of outrages increased from 252 to 292. 6 police were murdered, 17 v/ero wounded and 5 wero fired at without effect.   In addition a number of murders wore committed, involving the deaths of several loyal persons.On February 25th a force of 70 auxiliary and 7 regular police were attacked by rebels entrenched in the hills between Ballyvourney and Maoroom in the Co. Cork Martial Law area.   Major Grant wnd one constable were killed and six others wounded.   The police were forced to retire but were afterwards-, reinforced by a party of military and the rebels were dispersed.&apos;On February 20th a party of soldiers came into conflict with a number of rebels who took refuge in a house in the Midieton district.   A police patrol on hearing of the fight wont to the scene and joined the military party.   The house in which the rebels were was set on fire and they surrendered.   Sight prisoners, throe of whom were wounded, were captured and the bodies of thirteen were found.   A large amount of ammunition and some guns were also captured.Documents seized in the raid on Sinn Fein headquarters throw iight on the internal activities of Sinn Fein.   The &quot;Local Government&quot; report deals with the appointment of 14 &quot;Inspectors&quot; to visit Local Governing bodies   and the difficulties which have arisen in the collection of rates.   Rates are to be banked in the names of nominees, so as to safeguard them from seizures for decrees for criminal and malicious injuries., and a vote of  100,000 is to be mad available for loans to County Councils.   Evidently the position of the local authorities is a very serious one and pressure is to be brought to bear on the Banks by customers to induce them to provide tiie necessary financial accommodation. ;   The Financial Statement shows that the much boomed ten milliondollar/
\dollar loan in Amarioajfri^l&amp;od less than half that sura,4,694,377.43 dollars and of this-only 650,.000 dollars have, asyot, reached Ireland.   Expenses shown as &quot;payments   in U.S.A.&quot;amounted to 883.H9r.S8 dollars, leaving a balance of 3,223,529,54dollars.   From this cum certain dedxiotiens have to be madeamounting to 1,700,000 dollars and leaving according to thereport a fairly firm balance of 1^523,529.54 dollars or, roughly, 380,900 at en - exchange rate of four dollars.   The loan properis complete arid the amount subscribed in Great Britain and ireland is shown as  374,921, 6. 8:   of this  17,102 was received in gold.Loan expenses are given as  2,242. 16. 6.   Receipts other thanmonies included in the loan,, for the six months ending 31stOctober, 1920, amounted to  41,634. 9. 6M   while expenditure for the same period is shown as  51,965. 17. 4.   The period November to 31st December is, dealt with separately and receipts other than the loan are given as  522  with 17,436a 15. 1. expenditure.The &quot;Finance Minister&quot; reports a balance   in hand on the31st December, 1920, of  588,471. 4. 8., but of this  380 :W is in the United States.
