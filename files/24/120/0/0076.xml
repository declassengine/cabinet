Circulated by tho Secretary of State for India,SECRET.c.p, 2673 Safeguarding of Industries Bill.Since Sir Poberl lloiws memorandum of the -lith Doeembor PJ20 (CP. 237:1) was cireidated, great changes have been made in this Bill.(I) Ihniijiiiiij. The original idea was to have made (lumping a punishable offence. The new proposal provides for the imposition of a Customs duty of oDl, per cent, of the value of the goods. These will be valued by the Hoard of Trade, and the Hoard of Trade will therefore become a taxing authority.(2) Collapsed Kxidntnnrs.- The original scheme provided for the levy of a duty not exceeding GOjj percent, of tho value Of the goods. It is now proposed that I he duty should be equal to 3*3;&apos;. per cent, of the Value of the goods, as in the cast.&apos; of dumping. It was originally proposed that the collapsed exchange provisions should remain in force for three years while under the new proposals, orders by the Board of Trade are to have a maximum validity of three years in the lirst instance. But as under clause 10 no time limit is prescribed for Part (1. of the Dill, it would appear to be open to the Board of Trade to renew its orders and give them an indefinite length of currency.(3) it was originally proposed that flic collapsed exchange duly should be levied whenever the mark fell below a penny in value. The penny proviso has now disappeared, and therefore it would seem that (ho scope for the levy of the duty is thus considerably extended.(4) The definition of dumping which has now been accepted seems to me to be open to objection which I raised last year on a similar measure.I venture to think that the new Bill obviates none of the objections in principle to legislation of this kind which wore elaborated in my Cabinet memorandum of the 3rd January aiid have since been presented by the President of the Board of Education. I do not like any Bill which divests Parliament of the prime responsibility for the imposition of taxes, and the present seems a particularly inopportune occasion for introducing measures which will militate against Germany&apos;s capacity to meet her debts to the Allies, and must, at the discretion of the Board of Trade, diminish the power of Germany to buy from us and our Allies. 1 take no exception, however, to anti-dumping legislation, and lo key industries protection, for the Government has been committed, ever since its formation, to these two propositions, and doubts, which i confess I feel, as to the effect on our trade must be waived in view of commitments to which 1. am a party. I am sorry 3496    100 3/21
to find myself critical, but 1 would draw attention to tlic essential difficulties of legislation of this kind by quoting from Clause   (b) the words:&quot; prices ill which similar goods can bo profitably manufactured in this country,&quot;and consequently &quot;by reason thereof employ men I in any industry in (he United Kingdom is beiuif or is likely to be scriouslv affected.&quot;Are not Iheso vague words, which arc bound to give rise to a variety of opinion, strange expressions to find in a statute? Who can say bow far inventive genius stimulated In competition may bo able to lower the price at. which goods can be profitably manufactured in the United Kingdom? What is to happen when employment in one industry is seriously affected, whilst employment in other industries is materially increased as a consequence of the importation of such goods ?E. S. M.5th March 1921.
