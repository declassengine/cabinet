^ABILITY&quot; PENSIONS COIMITOTJ4FINAL REPORT,
inability: pensions coijkitt:^,Final   Report.1.&apos;   Jhe Disability Pensions Committee submit thoir concluding report dealing with tho retired pay of officers of tho F.oyal Havy and Royal Marines, the Army and Royal Air Force, and of Warrant Officers of the Royal Havy and Royal Marines, who retire after the war on account of disabilities not attributable to tho war, including the subject of wound pensions.2.     The rules for retired pay of officers are basedon such different principles in the Navy and Army that theCommittee do not considor it practicable to propose identicalschemes for tho two services.   In the Navy, retired pay,based upon ago and service, is granted to all officers(except those promoted from the lower deck who are dealtwith exceptionally) who are over the age of 40 years, whileofficers under that age, except Sub-Lieutenants, Midshipmenand Cadets, may bo granted retired pay based on rank andactual service in such rani: if invalided.   Captains andCommanders under the age of 40, receive if retired the halfpay applicable to their rank and seniority.   In the Army,on the other hand, an Officer is ineligible for retired p*yuntil after completion of 15 years&apos; service and the retired pay is based upon a service element and, if tho Officer boof the rank of Major or above, a rank element.Officers&apos; and,Warrant Officers1 Pisability Retired Pay,     Navy/.and..Marines,&apos; &quot;&quot;&quot;^3.    For the Navy the Committee havo taken the rates of Retired Pay already approved by tho Government on the
recommendation of the Halsey committee, and have made an addition for attributable disability at the rate of  100 a year for 100% disability.   In the case of Warrant Officers Commissioned Officers from Warrant Rank and Mates pensioned on Warrant Officers1 scale, the rate is  75 for 100$ disability, the lowor rate being compensated by a generally higher rate of Retired Pay in respect of the service element.   It ie neosfjsary however to postulate in the case of sub-lieutenants and officers junior thereto a rate of retired pay which will be payable only while the disability lasts.   The rates are shown in the table annexed to this report (Schedule A).Officers&apos; Disability Retired Pay^   kvw* 4*   For the Army the Committed recommend as follows: An officer who has been pronounced permanently unfit for general service on account of disease, wound or injury, directly attributable to the conditions of service, should have an addition to the retired pay which he has earned by rank and service of  100 a.year for total dis-ablenient or proportionate addition for less degree of dis-ablement, according to the degree and duration of his disablement.If he has less than 25 years total service he should.be granted, as a minimum, retired pay calculated at the rate cf  300 a year less  10 for each year or part of a year less than 25 with disablement addition as above, but without rank addition,If more favourable to the officer, fte should be granted retiredjpsy at the rate of  10 for each year of service, or  15 in the case of a Medical officer-1, together with rank element, disablement additions as before.
If the Officer has 5 or more years service, the service and rank element of his retired p*y should he per-manent;   hut if he has less than 5 years service, he should only draw retired pay so long as he is suffering from a disability of at least 20&apos;,- receiving on cessation of the disability a gratuity based on  100 for each year of service.An Army officer pronounced permanently unfit (due to service) may under existing regulations remain for 5 years on the half-pay list.   No ouch rule exists in the Navy or Air Force, and the majority of the Committee see no sufficient reason for its continuance in the case of the Army,   In their opinion an officer should be removed from the half-pay list as soon as it appears that he is permanently unfit for further service.The War Office representative strongly dissents from this proposal.   In his opinion it takes away from the officer a right which has existed for many years, and which could not very well be taken away from existing officers.   The War Office has expressed its objection to the proposal, and is moreover actually employing certain officers who are per-manently unfit for general service, and intend continuing to do so.   Further, it appears in the view of the War Office to be doubtful whether this question comes within the ssope of the Committee;   it seems rather an administrative question which should be left to the Army Council.The Committee do not consider that Article 564 of the Pay Warrant of 1914 gives Officers now serving the right to permanent retired pay equal to half-pay at the new in-creased rates in Army Order 324 of 1919;   but an officer now serving would have a vested right to elect the terms of Article 564 at Pay Warrant 1914 rates on his present rank, from the date of retirement, if more favourable to him than
than the compensation proposed in this report.An Arny Officer, under the present regulations, Who3e unfitness is not due to military service is not granted any half-p ay unless ho has 3 ye ar s . i o i v ice (th placed on the half-pay list).   Between 3 and 12 yen.ru service, the $rant of half pay Ja for periods ranging from one to five years,   If he has 12 (and less than 15) years service, the (f floor may draw half-pay for 5 years followed &quot;by retired pay equal   to half-pay for another five years -ending the grant.   If he has 15 years service, he would retire on retired pay.   Under the new Warrant (Army Ordor 324 of 1919) an Officer can retire with a gratuity aftor 10 yeara service.The above are the rules for combatant officers. Other officers have1, their -special rules,The Committee do not consider it necessary to recommend any alteration in theso regulations, but wish to record their opinion that grants of half-pay should be at current rates, in cases duo to non-attributable disability mentioned above.Officor.dV Disability Retired Pay.   Royal Air Force, 5,     In the Royal Air Force the scales of ordinary servico retired pay are framed on naval lines and tho Committee recommend that tho rates and conditions of dis-ability retired pay should also correspond generally with thoso of tho Navy.   The ranks of tho two Services, however and the conditions of service therein do not exactly corres-pond, and it is impracticable to apply the Naval scale to the Royal Air Force without modification.The Committoe have therefore, drawn up a separate soalo, Schedule B herewith.   This so ale they recommend for officers of the General Duties Branch of the Royal Air Force
serving on permanent commissions.Provision for other Branches - Stores, Medioal and chaplains etc. will also he required, hut the Committee consider that it would ho preferable that such modifications Of Schodulo B or such special scales as may bo necessary for this purpose should be worlced out by the Air Ministry in consultation with the Treasury in same manner as is proposed in paragraph 8 for territorial temporary and short sorvioo officers.General.6.     (a)   In any case where half-pay is drawn, the Committee do not recommend any addition for disability..(b)   Any Officer who eloots the conditions of voluntary retirement mus,:; be assumed to have waived all claim cn behalf of himself and his depondants for disability grants.(o)   Wnon a disabled officer has been five years on retired pay his degree of disablement Bhould be fixed at   . a permanent rate, unless this has already boon done.(d) Nq disability less than 20% is to be recognised as an attributable disability.(e) Disabilities of suoh extreme severity as to warrant exceptional treatment in excess of tho maximum of the scalo providod will need to be dealt with under the appropriate Dispensing &quot;Warrant or Ordor in Council.Wound Pensions and Wound Gratuities. 7.     The present system of wound pensions and gratuities is anomalous in three respects : -(l)   only officers receivo wound pensions and gratuities, and among officers tho pension varies not only with the degree of disability but even to a greater oxtent in accordance with rank: (2)   if the wound docs not cause the officer&apos;s retiro-ment, he draws his wound pension in addition to
the full service pay!   anci (3)   the pension and gratuity for the wound affords a higher rate of compensation than the pension for disease assessed by modern medical opinion as causing the s?;ne degree of disability. The second of these anomalies was the subject of adverse oomment by the Public Accounts Committee :-.n 1906.     The whole system was condemned by the Select Committee on Pensions, (paragraph ol of fchoir second Report).   That Committee while Btating that it was &quot;im-possible to make any radical change for officers disabled in the recent war&quot; recommended &quot;that the whole policy of wound pensions and gratuities should be reconsidered and a logical conclusion arrived at for the future.The majority of the present Committee are in agreement with this view that the time has come to re-consider the whole system.   They recommend accordingly that it should be abolished and that disabilities caused by wounds should in future be compensated at the same rates and on the same conditions as the equivalent die-abilities caused by attributable disease. Such compensa-ticn would be based on a schedule of specific injuries (applicable to men and officers alike) similar to that appended to the V/ar Warrant for men, dated the 6th December, 1919.The effect of this recommendation will be: (l)   to remove the distinction&apos; that previously existedbetween wounded officers and wounded men: (2)   tc remove the present anomaly whereby woundedofficers in receipt of full eersice- pay may draw a wound pension additional thereto:   and (3)   to bring the system of compensation for wounds
into accord with the prevailing medical opinion which regards the disabilities ensuing therefrom as not necessarily mere serious in kind than those resulting from disease.The Cemmittoo consider that the withdrawal of the prooent preferential treatment in the matter of monetary compensation to wounded officers should be accompanied by arrangements for free treatment of wounds by the Service Popartmont, at loaat in the earlier stages of tho cure, irrespective of the retention of tho officor on the active list, and they recommend that not   only tho first supply of artificial limbs and appliances but also their renewal and repair should bo arranged for as a charge on public funds.Tho representatives of the Admiralty and War Offico dissent from these recommendations and their respec-tive proposals will bo found at the end of this report. The majority of the Committee desire to observe that a scheme drawn on the lines of that put forward by tho Admiralty representative, would in fact represent a sub&quot; stantlal moasu.ro of reform and remove some of the more obvious objections to tho present system.   But there is this fatal complication attached to it&apos;    As a result of the Cabinet acceptance of the report of the Jerram Committee tho Admiralty feel themselves bound, whatever system of wound pensions is retained for officers, to extend that system to men.   It is indeed alleged that comparatively few men Would bo retained in the service after receipt of a wound and that thus it would seldom happen that a sailor would draw wound pension in addition to full pay.   It is not however considered by the majority.*     y    m
of the Committee that too great reliance can he placed on this argument.   The extension of the system of wound pensions to men is an entirely new development, it is contrary to the viows of the tfar Office, and it is felt that the Government would justly ho open to severe criticism if it now actually extended the scope of a system which has boon so strongly condemned by Parliamentary Committee. At the oame time the retention of the system, however modified in detail, for officors will place the Admiralty in a position of some difficulty if it   is noft extonded to men.   This consideration confirms tho majority of the Committee in their view that the proper course is to with-draw wound pensions and gratuities from officers. 8.   Outstanding questions.In the event of the Committee1s main recommendations being adopted certain minor questions, e.g. disability pensions for territorial, temporary and short service officers of the different services, diaattLity peneions for nurses, compensation for injuries in military games etc, will remain to be settled.   Tho Committee propose to consider those questions with a view to socuring reasonable uniformity. They do not, however, propose to submit any further reports, as tho authority for any special scales which may be necessary can bo settlod by correspondence between the servico departments and the Treasury.hePre(Sgd)   WILLIAM GANGER(Ministry of Pensions)(Sgd)   J.A.

Dissentient Report by tho Admiralty Representative.The Select Committee on Pensions in its SecondwoundsSpecial Report published last Deoember urged that /pensions required revision sinco too much Importance was attached to disfigurement ard disablement caused by loss of a limb or eyo and to rank.The aim of this Committee is accordingly to make suffi-oient allowance for attributable disablement from whatever cause arising and not to give an undue advantage to the specific injuries whioh have hitherto entitled toV/ounds pensions and wounds gratuities. I feel, however, that the tradition in favour of granting them is so strong that they oannot be finally abolished.   Furthermore until 1918 the King was pleased to reserve to himself tho considerationvof claims for Wounds Pensions,   By order in Council 27th September, 1918, the administration of such pensions was transferred to the Admiralty and it becomes incumbent on the Admiralty therefore to make His Majesty fully aware of any projected change in the admin-istration of these awards.They have little relation to loss of Earning capacity -in the case of Officers practically no,ne - but they are a solatium for suffering and disfigurement and loss of the amenities of existence, often accompanied by extra expense of living.   The Jerram Committee recommended their extension to men and the princi-ple was accepted by the Cabinet.The extension to men cannot be very serious!   In the caso of manual labourers serious injury would usually lead to immediate Invaliding.   In such cases the extra expense is limited to the period between the occurrence of the&amp;njury and the date of invalid-ing.   Where it does not involve invaliding the reasons given abovo apply equally in the case of Officers and men.
I accordingly propose that the scale of Disability additior. should be adopted as the basis for Wounds Pensions for both Officers men.For this purpose the classification of injurieo, drawn up ij the Ministry of Pensions to correspond with the disability percentage should be utilised (see Table D).A proportion only, say one half Of the Disability addition shrul(* be granted while tho Officer or man is in receipt of full pay. If he is subsequently retired or invalided either on acoount of the injury or for some other cause the full appropriate disability additioi for the sum of Disablement of all kinds then present should be grante; subject to periodical revision as may be necossary.Under this system the Wounds pension doponds upon the degrei pf disability not, as  tt present, upon the rank.A difficulty arises as regard Qatuities.At present Gratuities are given for the first year in &quot;In action&quot; cases.   Cases not &quot;in action&quot; receive a pension forthwith.   I propose a compromise between the two systems by which gratuities should still be awarded to Officers for the first year according to both rank and degree of disablement, and be granted in &quot;not in action:&apos; cases also (see Table\B).   The scale of gratuities proposed for the minor injuries is shevm in Table A, the award in the latter case depending, as at present, on the duration of the effects of the injury coupled with tho original severity.The system would work as follows :-.Serious injuries :- I,e* Injuries coming within the M     Polassification(a) While serving. Pull pay, jxLus gratuity according to rank for first year followed by a pension equivalent to half the appropriate Disability Addition.(b) When retired.   Retired Pay plus Gratuity, (if not already &quot;^    awarded) plus&quot; full appropriate DisabilityAddition for percentage of Disablement then found.
Minor injuries.   Gratuity only, either in full or a proportion according to the assessment as at present.The gratuity scale for men for minor injuries to bo that adopted for post-war disabilities less than 20/&amp; i.e.  100 as a maximum and without reference to rating.   for more severe injuries pension without initial gratuity to be awarded from date of injury on the same principle as for Officers.Note. -   Officers of the Royal Marines have hitherto been dealt with under Army Regulations but in accordance with the principle introduced in 1919 of assimilating as far as possible their emoluments, effootive and non effective, with thfise of officers of the Royal Navy, they should in future be dealt with under Naval Regulations.(Sgd)   T.D.

V&apos;&apos;Qu:ad tensions.   Dissentient report by tho ,;;ar OffioerepresentativesThe main principles held by the War Office are -1,   That a wound pension should be of a greater amount than the addition for medical disability of the same degree, 26    That there should bosome graduation fcr rank, 3,    That some payment should bemade while the officer is serving.The arguments for (l) arc :-(a) that wound pensions etc, have boon paid to officers for many generations, and the grant of a scale of additions to retire pay for medical disability is no reason for cutting wounds ppn-sions down to the medical disability level.   This would amount to an appreciable reduction in the emoluments of injured officers; and it is difficult, if not impossible, for them to insure against these risks,   Many officers who have been wounded in the war are drawing several hundreds a year morethan the disability scale would give them.(b) Compensation for disability is only paid on the ground that the disability is attributable to service,   Medical disability is of very varying degress of real attributability.   It is not every officer who succumbs to a campaign epidemic, and there forfeit might be argued that there is some personal predispositionto infection, i,e, that even in an extreme case attributabilityis not really totalu   This is an extreme view, but it shouldbe remembered that it is the disability and not the disease whiohdetermines the compensation, and this means that in very manycases it is only the exciting and not the predisposing element   .which is attributable,   Further we have the cases in which attribu-tability is doubtful, and the officer is &quot;given the benefit of the doubt1&apos;.
oftenThere is also very/great difficulty in deciding where infection arose.   If we limited compensation not only to degree of disability, but also to the degree of attributability, wo should probably on the average, reduce the rates very considerably.From all these variations, a wound or injury is entirely free;    it is obviously entirely due to service,,As to (2) the same principle of compensation would lead to higher pension for higher rank beoauoe the annual value of the lost prospects is greater and this is net adequately met by the earned increase in retired pay.It has been shown abovo that the degree of real attribut-ability is loss in medical disability than in wounds.   As the officer grows older, the gradual wearing out of tho human body makes the percentage of true attributability less and less in medical disability.   An increase for rank in wound pensions reflects this relatively decreasing attributability in medical cases,The main argument for (3) is that the serving officer has more expenses in consequence of his wounds than other officers, at any rate when the wound has bad serious effects.   An officer disabled medically, is not so likely to continue to servo;   if ho did, his extra oxpenses Org, in careful diet would be fluctuating expenses, suoh as many officers have to moot without having actually broken down in health.Nothing has been said above of &quot;sentimental&quot; consideration-tion c,g*, that the officer in risking his life should feel assured cf generous treatment;   that thore^s a certain &quot;glamour&quot; attached to a wound in action, etc.The main proposals are -Scale cf pension for total disablement caused by wounds rates for partial disablement being in proportion:
Field Mars.iJial or General 500   to    100v.&apos;ajor General or U eu tenantGeneral400   to80Colonel or ColoralC pram an dan t300   to60Lieutenant Colonel or Major250   to50Captains or Subalterns200   to40PayablQ from date cf wound;   half rates until the officer is retired.Injuries on duty not now classified as &quot;in action&quot; cases should be provided for on similar lines, but with a deduction of 25 per cent.The wound   pension would generally take the place of the disability addition to retired pay,A medical disability, separate from the wound dip-ability should be pensioned separately, but no degree of medical disability should be taken into account which with the disability from the wound would amount to more than total disablement,A memorandum on the subject drawn up &apos;by the War Office giving the views of the Army Council in fall, is annexed,(Sgd)   J,G, ASHOT(War Office)
officers wound pensions and gratuities. Views of the Army Council as to rules for futuro cases.1. The War Office docs not agree to the obliteration ofthe distinction between compensation given for wounds and for medical disabilities, though tho prosent system required considor-able alteration.   On the other hand, it is not suggested that0wound pension should be extended to disease caueB, as this would raise serious administrative difficulties.2. There should still bo a ucalo of wound pensions, but ofa more olastic charactor than at present.   Tho rates should reflect more accurately the degree of disablement, and the schedule of various forms of injuries attached to the Admiralty memorandum might be taken for that purpose.   The wound portion should take the place of the fluctuating disability addition (maximum  100) to retired pay.3. There should be graduation by rank, though the gradua-tion should not bo so steep as at prosent.     The higher the rank the greater tho loss of futuro retired pay oopeoially as the rank elcmont, which is only earned after a year in the rank, is such a large factor in the retired pay.   Tho case of the young officer who has risen ranidly in war and is disabled in fighting is not adequately dealt v/ith by the retired pay scale. 4. The pension should ,-not bo limited to officers on retired pay.   The serving officer is put to considerable expense in coo-sequenco of his wound and should receive consideration for this, But it would be sufficient to give half pension until ho retires, 0. A disabled officer should be allowed a sum not exceed-ing  100 a year for an attendant when necessary. (The present Ministry of Pensions Warrant confines this to 100% cases).
(5. For the first year after tho wound an officer who hasreceived a wound which entitles him to pension should receive pension en the total disablement scale, in place of the present wounds gratuity.7. Entitlement to this first year&apos;s pension should bodetermined on the same lines as entitlement to present Wounds gratuity.8. Injuries on duty not classified for compensation under present practice as &quot;in action cases&quot;, should bo provided for on similar lines but at reduced rates, say f of the &quot;in action&quot; rates.   They would not qualify for the total disable-raont rate of the first year.9, Wound pensions being granted in the main to compen-sate the officer for the permanent expenses caused by his wound should not be commuted.10. The following scale of pension for total disablementcases is suggested, rates for partial disablement being in proportion.Field Marshal or General  500   to    100Major General or LieutenantGeneral - 400   to   80Colonel or Colonel Commandant 300   to   60Lieutenant Colonel or major 250   to   50Captain or Subaltern 200   to   r*Q- pit -
