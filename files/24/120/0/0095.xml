Attacks on the Grown forces increased from 19 to 34, but the number of casualties sustained in these attacks was,proportionately,less (34 as compared with 32).The most notable event of the week was c.n ambush of a party of military ne^r Clonbannin, K nturk Distriot, Co. Cork, on the 5th instant, in which, I regret to state, Colonel Commandant Ourmiing, D*ScO,, the Officer commanding the Kerry Brigade was killed, together with another officer and two other rinks.   The military party which numbered thirty-five were proceeding from Rathmore to Bvcttevant in three motor tenders accompanied by an armouroc&quot; car, when they were assailed b;y heaty fire which was opened upon them from both sides of the road near Clonbannin.   Very few of the ambushers were seen but they are believed tr have greatly outnumbered the military party and were obviously well equipped with firearms including service rifleSo After 2-n engagement lasting about an hour a section oi tho
military party succeeded in effeoting a flanking novemont . on ono sido of the road but the rebels then drew off their forces before this oould be turned to full advantage.Colonel Gumming was hit at the beginning of the fight and died, instantly.     The total military casualties sustained in this engagement were 4 tilled and 2 wounded. The rebel leches are unknown.    Another ambush on a considerable aealee in which twenty&quot;five members of the Crown foress (18 police and 13 Military) were engaged took place at Gowol, Oar^io&amp;Ott tfhflijaon Distriot, Co.Leitrim on the 3rd in.sto.nt,   $out? military and. two polioo were wounded, ono of the former (an officer) mortally.The r&amp;litary casualties for the week included 6 soldiers who were murdered while&apos;talking unarmed in the streets of Cork City on the night of the 38th ultimoc   Theso murders were obviously intended as an act of vengeance for the execution of six rebels which took plaoe in Cork on that uorning.     Six other unarmed soldiers were fired at and wounded, in different parts of the City on the same night..Five attacks on occupied barracks were maoe during the week, in each oc.se without success.

-PRESENT STATE OP ;pOLJ.TICiJi OFIJT.ON ZE IRELAND,I desiro to draw the attention of my colleagues to an important speech delivered by the Earl of Ml diet on at a Conference mainly composed of leading Irish business men, held under the auspices of the Dublin Rotary Club, in Dublin yesterday.   Lord Midleton who, in this as in most matters may be regarded as voicing the opinion of the more Conservative section of Southern Unionists, although viewing the present trend of event3 in Ireland with the gravest anxiety is not without hope that an earnest effort may yet be made by responsible men of all parties in Southern Ireland to oome together with the endeavour to find a common formula for an immediate settlement which would have the Home Rule Aot as its basis, and expressed himself convinced that if this wer0 done the differences between the maximum concessions that the,^Government are prepared to make andthe minimum that the extremists would declare themselves able to aooept could be narrowed down to a negotiableQuantity a   While allowing the possibility that the Govern-mentva final offer might be rejected by the extremistshe felt that if it were in any way in accord with thewishes of the great majority of the people, it wouldbe the turning point between peace and the continuanceof disturbances, and th-t if a plebiscite were thentaken of the people of Southern Iusland on the questionof peace with acceptance or war without acceptance therewould be a reasonable prospect of a favourable issue.On the question of concessions by the Government, LordMidleton is of opinion that the present financial powers&apos;granted by the Act stand, in need of extension and that itis desirable that any foreseeable necessary mod ificationsof the Act should not be held over until the Parliamentof Southern Ireland is set up.   As the conclusion of the&quot;V,\
Conference the following resolution W&amp;S unanimously passed:&quot;Thir.t this meet in? forms it sell&apos; into a Committee to sub cribe a request to tho F&quot;ime Iliaistor to appoint a representative of the Cabinet to meet a small conference of representa-tive Southern Irishmen with po er to find a basis for   settlement, &quot;(Initialled)      E.S.IPvISH 0PFIC3, uAU10th Kerch, 1921.
