PART I.-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The outstanding event of the week has been the action of the Associated Society of Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen in issuing, on the 9th February, notices to their members instructing them to be in readiness for a strike if the Government do not concede an inquiry, into the Mallow incident, and guarantees for the safety of their members in Ireland. * The executive of the National Union of Railwaymen held a meeting to consider this matter on the 11th February, and Mr. J. H. Thomas undertook to demand a full inquiry as soon as Parliament assembles. The death of a railway porter as a result of injuries sustained at Mallow has now been reported, and it is possible that this event may have important influence on the policy of the National Union of Railwaymen.The serious unemployment situation shows no signs of improvement; the coal miners are now being affected in increasing numbers, owing to the lack of demand for coal for both inland and export purposes, and some 11,000 men are said to be already out of work in the Rhymney Valley district of South Wales alone.Further instances of wages reductions, either accepted or in contemplation, are being reported in considerable numbers, but, generally speaking, the questions are as yet local rather than national. An important case which has arisen in this connection is the proposal of the Birmingham and Wolverhampton District Association of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations for a reduction in the wages of youths and boys in the engineering trade within this area.Deputations from the British and Scottish Trades Union Congresses have been received during the week at various Ministries, and have put forward certain subjects to which they wish the Government to direct their attention during the forthcoming Parliamentary session. It is interesting to note that the Trades Union Congress, held at Portsmouth in September last, passed a resolution which, in effect, deprecated this form of approaching the Govern-ment, but that, nevertheless, the time-honoured procedure of deputations to Ministers has been continued. The deputation received by the Minister of Labour on the 11th February, besides dealing with resolutions concerning Trade Boards and other matters, which were passed by the Portsmouth Congress, raised two important new questions. The first of these related to the desirability of extension of unemployment benefit in the case of those who have exhausted the maximum number of weeks allowed by statute ; it was stated by the Minister that the Government are now considering this problem from a more general point of view since similar questions are arising, or have arisen, in the case of those persons receiving benefit under the 1911 Act, the 1920 Act, and the special arrangements made for ex-Service men.Meetings of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation and the Amalgamated Engineering Union have been in progress at York during the week, and joint conferences have been held to consider questions in which both these bodies are affected, the most important of these being the demarcation dispute with the National Union of Railwaymen concerning railway shopmen.The Parliamentary session opened on the 15th February. The Speech from the Throne referred to the problem of unemployment as being due to &quot; a world-wide restriction of trade which may be alleviated but cannot be cured by legislative means.&quot; It was announced that a Bill will be introduced extending the provision made for the unemployed under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920; reference was also made to Bills to deal with key industries and &quot; certain aspects of unfair and abnormal industrial competition.&quot;The Unemployment Position.Statistics. The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in the United Kingdom on the 4th February was 352,074, of which 329,782* The executive committee of the society decided on the 17th February to instruct their members not to strike on the Mallow issue, unless further instructed.
The General Situation-continued.were lodged by men and 434 by women totally unemployed, and 21,804 by men and 54 by women working short time. On the 28th January there were 341,816 policies lodged, of which 322,334 were lodged by men and 469 by women totally unemployed, and 18,837 by men and 176 by women working short time.On the 4th February in the United Kingdom 1,348,703 unemployment books remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Act, of which 400,081 were lodged by men and 301,291 by women totally unemployed, and 250,299 by men and 397,032 by women working short time; an increase on the previous week of 40,271 totally unemployed and 28,190 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 11th February was 1,143,300. The above are advance figures provided by the Employment Department, and are subject to revision.&apos; A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 186FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Relief of Unemployment. The position has been rendered more serious during the week by the fact that in a large number of cases the 8-weeks&apos; period for receiving benefits under Section 44 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, is now terminating. This is stated to be causing considerable distress, especially among women workers. It is proposed to deal with this and other questions arising out of the Unemployment Insurance Act by means of emergency legislation.With regard to the government&apos;s proposals for &quot;the absorption of ex-Service men into the building industry, meetings have been held between the Government and representatives of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers to consider the position created by the rejection of the Grovernmentfs offer by the trade unions affiliated to the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives.Scottish building trades operatives have now voted on the proposals, but the exact figures have not yet been published. It is believed that there will be a large majority in favour of rejection.An interesting experiment is being tried in Leeds. Some weeks ago the Lord Mayor of Leeds put forward a scheme for the co-operation of employers and employees to overcome the existing deadlock. Representatives of local employers and workpeople&apos;s organisations were invited to a conference at Leeds, held on the 21st January, when it was proposed by the Mayor that the unemployment difficulty might be relieved by the formation of joint committees in each separate trade in the district. These committees, composed of an equal number of representatives of employers and workpeople, should then go into the problem of unemployment in their several industries with a view to a fundamental change in the method of assessing the rewards of capital and labour, based on the proportionate share of each in the cost of production. It is intended that the committees, besides dealing with the possibilities of such a change in the wage basis by some form of profit-sharing, and with measures for the speedy restoration of trade, that is, with proposals for removing the prime causes of unemployment, should also concern themselves., with remedial measures to meet the immediate problem in each industry. Meetings of trade union and employers&apos; representatives for the clothing, textile, engineering, glass, printing, boot and shoe, . and leather industries have now been held, and some progress has been made in the formation of the committees suggested by the Lord Mayor.Labour and Ireland. As a result of the shooting at Mallow, on the 31st January, of two members of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, the executive committee of the society decided to write to the Prime Minister demanding an inquiry into the affair, at which the society should be represented, and guarantees for the safety of their Irish members. The letter concluded with an ultimatum that, unless the demands were granted by the 15th February, a national strike of all members of the union would be called. The Prime Minister, in reply, stated that no threat of a national strike could be permitted to influence the action of the Government on a(B 16989T) Z 2
Features of the Week-continued.matter of the administration of the law, but that the Government would consider the question on its merits, after receiving information from Ireland. The situation thus created was considered at a meeting of the executive committee of the National Union of Railwaymen on the 11th February, and Mr. J. H. Thomas then stated that he would raise the whole issue in Parliament with a view to pressing for a full public inquiry. Mr. Bromley has announced that the society do not regard the question as a political one, but simply as a matter of protecting the lives of the members of the society.It is now reported that a railway porter, a member of the National Union of Railway-men, died on the 13th February as a result of injuries sustained in the Mallow shooting, and this has made the dispute a matter of direct concern to the union. A statement has been issued by the &quot; loyal staff of the Irish northern railways &quot; repudiating the strike threat, and announcing that it will be ignored north of Dublin by railwaymen of all grades.Trades Union Congress. A deputation representative of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Trades Union Congress has visited various Ministers during the past week, to submit for their consideration resolutions passed at the annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress held in September, 1920.On the 8th February the deputation, accompanied by representatives from the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, the colliery firemen, examiners and deputies, and the United Vehicle Workers, visited the Home Secretary. The main resolution dealt with amendments to the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, and demanded that employers should be responsible for providing work at full wages for men partially disabled by injury; that, in cases of fatal accident, the sum of  400, or a sum equal to three years&apos; wages, should be paid to the principal claimant; and that, in cases of physical disfigurement, a lump sum should be paid in addition to weekly payments. Other resolutions brought forward related to the right of colliery deputies, firemen and administrative staffs to join trade unions ;J the State employment of colliery deputies; the temperature of factories ; compulsory work-shop accommodation in the tailoring industry; and the co-ordination of Hackney and Stage Carriage Acts. The Home Secretary, in his reply, expressed sympathy with regard to the proposals on workmen&apos;s compensation, and stated that it might be possible to introduce during the coming session a Bill, of limited character which might prove satis-factory, and that a Bill would also be introduced dealing with factory legislation, which might embody certain points submitted by the deputation.On the 10th February the deputations visited the Secretary for Mines/and submitted resolutions relating to mine-owners&apos; benefit schemes, the State employment of colliery deputies, and certificates of competency. The amendment of the Coal Mines Acts to make provision for the State employment of deputies was advocated as a means of pre-venting accidents in mines more effectively, and, in the interests of safety, it was urged that men in positions between under-managers and deputies should hold at least second-class certificates cf competency. In his reply, the Secretary promised to make inquiry into the conditions of mine-owners&apos; benefit schemes, but stated that the State employment of deputies would necessitate a revision of the whole system of mining administration and involve new legislation; and no promise concerning this could be made. He also promised to consult the Board for Mining Examinations on the question of certificates of competency.On the 9th February the deputation, accompanied by representatives of the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union, visited the President of the Board of Trade, and presented resolutions protesting against the employment of Chinese and other Asiatic labour in the manning of British ships, requesting the Government to introduce a Bill to repatriate all Chinese who cannot produce satisfactory evidence of British nationality, and asking that in future no Chinese should be engaged on British ships west of the Suez Canal. The accommodation for seamen on board ships was declared to be inadequate, and the Board of Trade were requested to see-that,-all possible1&apos;facilities.&apos;are provided as regards light, space, sanitation and ventilation. The President, in reply, said that the depart-ment would look into the matter, and that statistics showed that fewer Chinese and other Asiatics were now employed oh British ships. No legislation on this question could be promised, but the department would do all that they could, under their administrative powers, to meet the points raised.On the 10th February the deputation visited the President of the Board of Education, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Transport. Resolutions were placed before Mr. Fisher urging secondary education with maintenance for every child qualified to benefit
Features of the Week--continued.by it; full representation of the views of uncertificated teachers; and the prohibition of schools- and classes controlled by employers. Dr. Addison was urged to increase the amount of sickness benefits, payable under the National Health Insurance Acts; to institute a full medical service throughout the kingdom under the Ministry of Health, and to provide for unhealthy and dangerous occupations by recognising State liability. Sir Eric Geddes was requested to enforce the terms of Section 5 (1) of the Locomotive Act, 1898, which relate to the number of persons who must be employed in drawing or attending locomotives passing along highways.On the 11th February the Minister of Labour received the deputation, and considered resolutions laid before him concerning Trade Boards, unemployment insurance and the hours of seamen. It was stated that in many cases Trade Board wage rates were being deliberately ignored by employers, who declared that they would not pay unless compelled . to do so. It was suggested that powers should be given to unions to take action on failures to pay the statutory rates, similar to those granted to them under the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts. The Minister replied that a committee on Trade Boards&apos; administration had been appointed in November last year, and would present a full report next week. It was pointed out by the deputation that only two Trade Boards had been set up in the distributive trades; the Minister said that this work was proceeding as rapidly as possible, and drew attention to the number of trades where preliminary action had been taken.With reference to the suggestion that Employment Exchanges should refuse to fill vacancies where the wages offered were below the trade union rates, the Minister stated that he could not issue such an instruction, on account of the difficulty in deciding what was the standard rate in a given locality unless this rate was one fixed by statute. He thought that the proposals of the Barnes Committee on the Employment Exchanges offered a benefit under Section 8 (1) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, of persons unemployed in consequence of a trade dispute. The Minister stated that if the employers and employees could come to some mutual agreement, he would put it forward to the House of Commons as an amendment to the Act. The question of expediting the reimbursement to trade unions of moneys paid by them under the Unemployment Insurance Act was also discussed, and the Minister stated that every effort would be made to speed up the machinery of repayment.Trade Union Topics.South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. At a meeting of the Pontypridd District Committee of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, held on the 7th February, a resolution was passed, authorising the secretary to write to the executive of the Federation urging that action should be taken before the introduction of the next Budget to secure a substantial increase in the income-tax exemption limit, the figure mentioned being  500. It will be remembered that this question was ^considered by the Federation rather more than a year ago, and the amount then suggested was  250.United Pattern Makers&apos; Association. The association have decided to take a ballot vote on the question of excluding from the union all members who continue to work any bonus or piece-work system after the 1st July, 1921. The current report of the union states that the executive committee are continually being informed that members are agreeing to work on piece-work systems, which are not admissible according to the national decision on the question of payment by results; and that approximately 4,000 of the members are covered by various schemes of payment which the executive cannot recognise as flat time-rates.London Teachers&apos; Association. At the annual conference of this association, on the 12th February, it was announced that the proposals for amalgamation with the National Union of Teachers had been approved, and that the result of the voting showed 6,637 votes in favour of amalgamation, and 2,898 against.possible solution of the difficulty.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Engineers (National). It will be recalled that as a result of a conference at York on the 29th and 30th September, 1920, the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations and the Amalgamated Engineering Union came to an agreement with regard to the working of overtime and night-shifts in the engineering industry. The agreement was subsequently endorsed by a ballot vote of the members of the union and by the constituent bodies of the employers&apos; federations.* The interpretation of certain clauses in the agreement came up for consideration at the joint meeting at York of both parties on the 10th and 11th February. The chief point at issue was the question as to who was the authority for deciding when overtime was necessary. On this the parties were unable. to come to any understanding, the employers, on the one hand, claiming that they were the only party who could make the decision, while the union claimed that they were entitled to a voice in the matter, having regard to all the circumstances that might obtain at any moment.Youths and Boys in the Engineering Trades (Birmingham and Wolverhampton). The Birmingham and Wolverhampton District Association of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations have given notice for a reduction in wages for youths and boys throughout the area covered by the association, to operate from the 21st February. The reductions suggested are, for those aged 14, from 21s. 3d. per week to 12s. ; for those of 15, from 22s. 9d. to .15s.; for those of 16, from 24s. 9d. to 19s.; for . those of 17, from 26s. 3d. to 23s.; for those of 18, from 45s. Qd. to 28s.; for those of 19, from 48s. to 33s.; and for those of 20, from 50s. to 40s.On the employers&apos; side it is stated that there is no intention of exploiting the present wages depression, but it is definitely declared that the war bonuses conceded to youths are all out of proportion to their output as compared with that of adults. Mr. E. Hallas, M.P., president of the Birmingham and Western District of the National Union of General Workers, has strongly protested against this decision on the ground that, while advances in wages were obtained during the war as the result of negotiation and arbitration, the proposed reductions are to be put into operation without any conference with the trade unions concerned.The Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades have had the matter under review, and at their quarterly meeting at York last week, adopted the attitude that this action of the Birmingham and Wolverhampton employers contravened the national agreement recently arrived at between the federation and the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations, for the stabilisation of present wages for a period of six months, f They have consequently decided on a policy of resistance, and will support their members in any steps that it may be deemed necessary to take in order to maintain the existing rates of wages.Wagon Builders (Midlands). A notice of reduction of rates has been issued by the wagon builders&apos; section of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations to the workpeople employed by the Metropolitan Amalgamated Wagon Co., Ltd., the Midland Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Co., Ltd., and the Birmingham Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Co., Ltd. In no case, however, is the reduction to bring the men&apos;s earnings for a 47-hour week below the standard rates of the wagon trade for the class of work on which they are engaged. A complication has arisen out of the fact that certain members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, probably former members of the Amalgamated Society of General Toolmakers, Engineers and Machinists or the United Machine Workers&apos; Association, have been rated at less than the usual district rates for the engineering trades. Their actual earnings, however, were in excess of the current earnings in the engineering trades, and they were therefore allowed to continue undisturbed by the union. The reduction, however, will put them in a more unfavourable position as compared with the men in the engineering trades in receipt of district rates. .       &apos;For some time it appeared that the proposed reductions would not be opposed; in fact, at the Wednesbury works of the Metropolitan Company a mass meeting of the men definitely agreed to accept. The unions concerned, however, have now intervened and have refused to permit the adoption of this course of action.* See this Report, Vol. II,.No. 15, 29th October, p. 437, and No. 25, 18th December, p. 638. f See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 1,1st January, p. 8.
Hearth Furniture Operatives (Midlands). The Hearth Furniture Manufacturers&apos; Asso-ciation have notified the National Society of Brass Workers and Metal Mechanics that they -are proposing to reduce wages by 4s. a week. It is expected that the employers&apos; proposal will be discussed at the next meeting of the unofficial joint council for the industry. Before making this proposal the association decided to reduce selling prices by 10 per cent.Screw Operatives (Midlands). The Midland screw manufacturers have decided to propose the same schedule of wages reductions as has been proposed by the Midland Nut and Bolt Manufacturers&apos; Association^ with the addition that piece-rates for women shall be fixed to yield not less than 405. a week.Vehicle Builders (Scotland). Notice of intention to reduce wages by 3d. an hour, and to increase the working hours from 47 to 48 a week as from the end of February, has been given by the Scottish Vehicle Builders&apos; Association to the National Union of Vehicle Builders. The employers have also intimated that the additional penny an hour granted under the agreement of the 13th November lastf to skilled workmen employed on coach work, that is, passenger-carrying vehicles, will be cancelled. The union have lodged a counter-claim on behalf of their members involved in Scotland, for an increase of 3d. an hour and a reduction in working hours to 44 a week. The negotiations appear to be on a national basis, as a conference was held at Leeds on the 2nd February and was adjourned until the 16th.  No report is to hand of the result of the latter meeting.Boot and Shoe Operatives (National). In view of the expiry of the national wages agreement for the boot and shoe trade on the 31st March next, the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives have submitted proposals for a new agreement to the manu-facturers&apos; association. The main provisions contemplated are a 5-day working week of 40 hours ; a minimum of  5 weekly for all males 21 years of age, and of  3 10s. weekly for all female operatives 20 years of age ; a guaranteed weekly wage throughout a 52-week year at not less than the minimum wage-rate ; and the abolition of overtime.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Nut and Bolt Operatives (South Staffordshire). All the leading nut and bolt manufacturers in South Staffordshire, situated mainly at Darlaston and Wednesbury, served notices, on the 7th February, for a general reduction of wages to both male and female operatives, day-workers and piece-workers. It was stated in the Engineer of the 28th January that this action was &quot; in full accord with the now united policy of the National Federation of Manufacturers.&quot; The notices are intended to come into operation on the 23rd February. Some 600 or 700 women workers at Darlaston have already struck, but it is understood that their action has not received the sanction of the officials of the National Union of General Workers, to which the majority of the workers concerned belong. The Nut and Bolt Manufacturers&apos; Association held a meeting on the 11th, and intimated that, unless there was a resumption of work on the reduced terms, the firms concerned would close down. *Settlements and Agreements.Plumbers and Heating and Domestic Engineers (Manchester). It was recently reported that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress had appointed a sub-committee to investigate and adjudicate upon the demarcation dispute between members of the National Union of Operative Heating and Domestic Engineers and the United Operative Plumbers and Domestic Engineers&apos; Association at Manchester. J The question at issue was the line of demarcation to be observed in carrying out a contract for the Manchester housing scheme, for conveying hot and cold water supplies for domestic purposes, the hot water being centrally heated. The sub-committee issued their report on the 8th February. They upheld the plumbers&apos; contention that the fixing of pipes for conveying water for domestic purposes was plumbers&apos; work, and that the fixing of pipes for heating and warming should be recognised as the work of heating engineers, and decided that the claim of the plumbers to the actual work in question had been established. The members of the United Operative Plumbers and Domestic Engineers&apos; Association, who had been out on strike since the 7th November, 1920, have consequently resumed work.* See below under Strikes and Lock-Outs.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 22, 27th November, p. 60SX See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 6, 5th February, p. 129.
* In connection with this problem of demarcation, it may be noted that, by way of dealing with a similar position at Edinburgh, the Edinburgh Corporation inserted a clause in the contract with the laundry engineers for the equipment of their wash-houses to the effect that &quot; in the fitting of any piping in connection with supply to tanks or from the main, or in connection with any internal hot or cold water supplies, and generally any of that class of work claimed by the master and operative plumbers to be plumbers&apos; work, the successful contractor should bind himself to supply skilled and competent plumber workmen as distinguished from engineers or fitters.&quot;j- About 80,000 operatives in all are affected, being represented by the National Society of Dyers and Finishers, the Amalgamated Society of Dyers, Bleachers, Finishers, and Kindred Trades, and the Operative Bleachers, Dyers and Finishers&apos; Association, Bolton Amalgamation, together with 9 other allied Trade Unions.J The employers&apos; organisations concerned in the arbitration are the Allied Association of Bleachers, Dyers, Printers and Finishers, the Hebden Bridge Association, the Bradford Dyers&apos; Association, Ltd., and the Yorkshire Master Dyers&apos; Committee.In order to avoid further disputes of a similar nature between these two organisations^ the Parliamentary Committee have offered their services to convene a conference of both parties with a view to amalgamation. Difficulty has arisen out of the fact that apparently the standard wages vary as between the two organisations, being in each case governed by separate agreements. The sub-committee are convinced that the only means of preventing contractors using one section of workmen against the other is to amalgamate the two organisations. It is understood that the United Operative Plumbers and Domestic Engineers&apos; Association are agreeable to the proposal for a conference on this question, but that, so far as is known at present, the attitude of the other union concerned is undefined.Textile Printing, Bleaching, Dyeing and Finishing Operatives (Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cheshire and Derbyshire). In connection with the expiry of the agreements on the 17th October, 1920, covering wages and conditions in the textile printing, bleaching, dyeing and finishing trades, and the consequent dispute over the fresh claims lodged by the operatives&apos; representatives, it will be recalled that the questions at issue were submitted to an ad hoc court, the arbitrators being Sir Allan Smith, M.P., for the employers, and Mr. Hugh Dalton, for the employees, with Mr. J. A. Compston, K.C., as independent chairman and umpire. The terms of reference agreed upon by Mr. A. Shaw, secretary of the National Society of Dyers and Finishers and Textile Workers, who acted as corresponding secretary for a &quot; Joint Movement &quot; representing all the operatives&apos; unions involved,f and by Mr. L. D. Kidson, on behalf of the employers&apos; associations,! were as follows:-&quot; That an advance of 40 per cent, be granted on the current rates to all operatives dealt with under previous agreements ; that a minimum rate of  5 for 48 hours per week be granted to males 21 years of age and over; that a minimum rate of  3 per week be granted to females 18 years of age and over; that piece-workers be guaranteed 25 per cent, higher earnings over day-workers ; that consideration be given to the agreement for the shorter working week with a view to limiting the hours to 48 ; the payment for all holidays, including a full week&apos;s pay.&quot;The two arbitrators having been unable to arrive at an agreed decision, it devolved upon the chairman and the umpire to make the Award. The Award was issued on the 10th February in the following terms : &quot; 1. Having regard to the protection offered to the workmen in regard to the increased cost of living by the sliding scale, they have not made out a case for a present advance in current rates for all operatives, nor for a present minimum rate of  5 for 48 hours for adult males or  3 for adult females.&quot; 2. Piece-workers are entitled to 25 per cent, higher earnings over the day-workers.&quot; 3. Consideration cannot now be given to an agreement for a shorter working week with a view to limiting the hours of work to 48, without at the same time entering into the larger question of unemployment and under-employment.&quot;4. Payment for holidays ought not now to be imposed upon the employers since it is also an element in the same larger question.&quot; 5. In so far as it is permissible for me to make any recommendation to the employers, and as an expression of opinion rather than decision, I urge upon them the desirability of settling with the workmen without delay a scheme which will embrace the matters referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Award (a 48-hour week and payment for holidays), together with all other matters affecting unemployment and under-employment.&quot;It is understood that a meeting of employers and employees will shortly be held to consider the Award.The only concession in the Award applies to piece-workers, who have previously had an arrangement providing for the rates to be fixed to enable them to earn 25 per cent.
(b 16989T)2Amore than day-workers, before the addition of cost-of-living wages. The Award now provides, for rates to be fixed to enable piece-workers to earn 25 per cent, more than the day-workers on the total earnings. Piece-workers, however, form a considerable proportion of the total number employed ; according to Mr, Arthur Shaw, the proportion of piece-workers in Yorkshire is approximately 50 per cent., and in Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire over 80 per cent.Pottery Operatives (National). Consequent upon negotiations which have been proceeding, an agreement has been made between the British Pottery Manufacturers&apos; Federation and the National Society of Pottery Workers, the National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and Electrical Workers, and the Public Works and Constructional Operatives&apos; Union, that no notices shall be lodged by either side for any alteration of wages to take effect on and after the 25th March, 1921, which has been described as the &quot; Potters&apos; Annual Settling Day.&quot; In effect, this should result in the stabilisation of present wages for the next twelve months.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 180 to 184.]
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Surgical Instruments. At a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council, on the 27th January, the main questions considered were the proportion of boys to men, and the training of apprentices. The employers proposed that the proportion should be one boy to two men. Eventually the employers agreed to the postponement of the question for six months, provided that either side might raise the question in April. As regards the training of apprentices, it was agreed that in addition to any attendance compulsory under the Education Act, boys, whether leaving school at .14 or at 16, should be encouraged to attend evening classes on two evenings per week. It was further agreed that, for boys leaving school at 14, the age for commencement of apprenticeship should be about 14i, and that it was desirable that they should be employed in the works for about six months before their apprenticeship agreements were signed. The operatives announced that the Amalgamated Engineering Union executive were shortly to consider their attitude towards Whitley Councils, and it was possible that they would withdraw their members from the Councils on which the union were represented.Wrought Hollovj-ivare. The annual meeting of the Industrial Council was held on the 9th February, and discussed a resolution, put forward by the employers&apos; side, that for female workers, youths and unskilled male workers, the rates of wages from the date of the meeting be the existing Trade Board minimum rates, and that a reduction of 12  per cent, be effected in the wages of all classes of skilled workers.The employers argued that, unless very substantial reductions in cost and selling prices were forthcoming, the industry would die. If a temporary inconvenience were felt as a result of the proposed reduction, the workers should look upon it as a form of insurance. In view of the 20 per cent, drop in the price of raw material, manufacturers would be compelled to sell for the next six months articles made of materials that could be bought to-day at  30 per ton cheaper. Imports of Continental enamel were increasing. American workers had accepted a reduction of from 15 per cent, to 30 per cent, in wages. Of the total cost of production, 85 per cent, went in wages.The workers&apos; side stated that this was the last industry to advance wages, and the first to move for a reduction. The galvanised hollow-ware worker was still 4s. Sd. below the rate of the Midland sheet-metal worker, and if the sheet-metal worker&apos;s rate could be upheld, there should be no reduction in the hollow-ware industry. The tremendous advances gained by the iron and steel workers were subject that week to a reduction of only 5 per cent. If full time were guaranteed the proposal might be reconsidered. Finally it was agreed to adjourn for three weeks, in order that the workers&apos; side might obtain the opinion of the rank and file.Riveters (Clyde, Tyne, Wear and Tees). Claims were made that the riveting rates applicable on oil-tank vessels should be made applicable to the cellular bottom intended to carry oil instead of water, and to the shell in the wake of oil-compartments, in dry cargo ships now being built to use oil fuel. The price-list makes special provision for oil-carrying vessels, but not for those carrying oil for their own fuel.In the case of the Tyne, Wear and Tees district, the Industrial Court decided that in cellular bottoms where water-tight riveting only is done, no extra payment should be made whether the vessel is a dry cargo vessel or not. If, however, riveters are called upon by the firm to do extra work, or to perform their work with extra care, to make the work oil-tight, a rate of Is. per 100 rivets extra on the Tyne and Wear rivaters&apos; piece-work price-list now in operation shall be paid in respect of the shell, and 9d. per 100 rivets in respect of tank top, tank margin and other pressed work in connection with the cellular bottom. In similar circumstances a payment of Is. per 100 rivets extra shall be paid in respect of the work on the shell in the wake of other oil compartments,
In the case of the Clyde district, the Court held that Note 7 of the Clyde list does not apply to-rivets in the double bottom of vessels the double bottoms of which are now being used for carrying oil as well as for carrying water ballast, or to the shell in the wake of oil compartments on merchant vessels or dry cargo carrying vessels. If care were especially taken to ensure that the work should be oil-tight, the Court were of the view that an extra rate should be paid, which might be that set out in Note 7, namely, an advance of 10 per cent, on list prices.   (Awards No. 614 and 615.)BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Building. The Joint Industrial Council met on the 10th and 11th February. The Resettlement Committee presented their report, the chairman putting forward the suggestion that the Council might wish to consider severing the official connection of the committee with the Government. This suggestion was not taken up, but the report of the committee was accepted.  It is proposed to co-opt an architect on the committee.The Management and Costs Committee presented a brief statement as to the work being carried out, and the Council approved the proposal to make an extended inquiry into the amount of time lost owing to stress of weather. As the committee had decided not to proceed with their original report, the attitude of the employers was much more friendly. They appeared to welcome the proposals for dealing with unemployment by a supplementary scheme under the Unemployment Insurance Act.The Education Committee reported on the progress being made in setting up local apprenticeship committees. The President of the Board of Education has warmly supported the interest the Council are taking in education and apprenticeship matters.Arising out of the resignation of the Scottish National Building Trades&apos; Federation (Employers) from the Council, a motion was adopted accepting the resignation, but appointing a deputation to interview the Federation, to induce them, if possible, to with-draw their resignation if satisfactory arrangements could be made for setting up Regional Councils.The Management and Costs Committee met on the 9th February. A representative of the Employment and Insurance Department stated that the cost of abolishing the three &quot; waiting days &quot; under the Unemployment Insurance Act would be approximately 20 per cent, more both from employers and operatives. To cover the proposed benefit of 30s. per week in addition to the State benefit of 15s., the total contribution would be approximately Is. Id. per week. This would not cover payment for any broken periods lost owing to stress of weather, and no useful statistics were available on this point. It was decided that the formation of a scheme to provide benefit for parts of a day lost through inclement weather be the subject of a statistical inquiry.Bricklayers (Chadderton). In December, 1920, a difficulty occurred with regard to the employment of bricklayers on the Chadderton District Council housing scheme. The contractors sub-let the bricklaying for the houses to 6 bricklayers at a fixed price per house. It was reported that under this system the men laid, on an average, 1,000 bricks a day and earned about  8 a week. The local union official objected on the ground that the union would not allow piece-work in any form. After a fruitless meeting on the 4th January, a second conference was held on the 22nd January, at which the contractors agreed to pay off the sub-contractors as from the 22nd January, and to continue the work by union labour under union conditions. It was also agreed that, if the sub-contractors wished to remain on the job, these who who were not members of the union would be accepted as such.   This agreement has been put into operation.Building Trade Dispute (Inverness District). During December, 1920, the building trade operatives in the district of Inverness approached the employers&apos; association with a proposal that the rate of wages fixed under the Scottish Grading Scheme should be recognised in the Inverness district, although the district enployers&apos; association are not party to the scheme. The employers rejected the proposal, and declined to-meet the operatives at a conference which was proposed by the local officer of the department. The rates paid in the district are: Is. lid. to masons, bricklayers, joiners, plumbers and slaters; Is. lOd. to painters; Is. 9d. to plasterers; and from Is. 3d. to Is. Qd. to labourers. The rate for tradesmen for this district under the Scottish Grading Scheme is 2s. 2d.The North of Scotland Master Carpenters&apos; Association offered their workmen 2s., but the offer was rejected. Members of the Association then declared a lock-out as from the 31st January, until an agreement should be arrived at. Approximately 250 joiners were involved.  With the exception of the painters, all other building trades operatives,(b 16989T) 2 A 2
* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 6, 5th February, p. 138.about 200, struck work on the 1st February. Every endeavour has been made by the local officer of the department to arrange for a joint conference, but the employers have &quot;definitely refused to meet the operatives.QUARRYING.Artificial Stone. In September, 1920, the workers&apos; side of the Artificial Stone Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee applied for an increase of 5d. per hour plus 14 days holiday with pay, to come into operation at the expiration of the existing agreement in October, 1920. The employers made an offer of 2d. per hour for labourers and makers, \\d. for finishers, and \d. for youths. The workers&apos; side undertook to refer this offer to their members but refused to give it their recommendation. No official intimation has so far been received as to the result, but the secretary of the committee understands that the offer has been accepted by the men, who are now working under the new rates of pay.Quarrying. The Safety and Welfare Committee of the Joint Industrial Council interviewed the Director of Health and Safety, Department of Mines, on the 7th February, with reference to misunderstandings which had taken place regarding the work of the committee. As a result he undertook to submit any contemplated draft regulations regarding quarries to the committee for consideration. An informal discussion of certain technical questions then took place, and employer members volunteered to carry out certain experiments regarding explosives.FOOD AND DRINK.Bakers (Scotland). Apart from the Girvan case, which has been referred to the Industrial Court, the wages dispute may now be considered as at an end. Settlements have been effected throughout Scotland, with the exception of a few minor areas, in some of which the workers&apos; places have been filled by non-union labour. The national working agreement of the Joint Industrial Council terminates on the 28th February. Proposals for revision&apos; are being formulated, and a meeting of the Council may be expected at an early date.flour milling: Short Time. The Board of the employers&apos; federation have refused to accept the recommendations of the executive committee as mandatory. * The employers have added two further resolutions which they submitted to a special meeting of the Joint Industrial Council on the 10th February.   These resolutions are in the following terms :-&quot; Nothing in the resolution guaranteeing that the wages payable to an employee are not to be diminished by more than two-elevenths of the standard weekly pay shall prevent a miller from employing flour milling operatives, for whom he has no work or insufficient work, in some part other than flour milling of his entire undertaking, at the rate of pay applicable to the substituted job.&quot;&quot; The resolution affirming what is known as a guaranteed week shall not in any way interfere with the right of the employer to effect a permanent reduction, or with the right of the employer to discharge an employee for bad conduct, inefficiency or any other reason of that nature,&quot;At the meeting of the Council no agreement was come to, the employees&apos; representatives making a strong attempt to insist that the original resolutions should be mandatory, and some of their number also urging that even the wages reduction of two-elevenths was too great a sacrifice. The matter was finally adjourned, pending a meeting of the Council to be held on or before the 1st March, in order that the labour side might discuss the position further among themselves.-Fishing Industry (Grimsby). The union presented an amended claim, and undertook to recommend resumption of work if the owners would accept it as a basis for discussion. The owners refused to discuss any claim whatsoever. The union then offered resumption of work if the owners would re-open negotiations. The reply was to the effect that before any readjustment of wages took place the union would be consulted. It was then decided by the dnion to call off the strike, as from midnight on the 10th February.TRANSPORT.Road Transport (London). Joint terms of reference to arbitration have not yet been agreed. The employers&apos; association state that the union have raised a new issue by claiming retrospective payment of the advance from the 11th December.
POTTERY AND RUBBER.Pottery Workers: Reduction of War Bonus (Scotland). In the Scottish pottery industry 400 out of 600 men are unemployed, and the employers have given notice to reduce the war bonus from b\d., 4ijjd. and %\d. per hour paid to men, women and boys, respectively, to a general rate of 9*\d. per hour. They have refused a conference with the society, on the ground that the arbiter in a recent case affecting the interpretation of the Conciliation Board rules decided that general wages questions did not come within the Board&apos;s functions.   The Chief Conciliation Officer has been asked to intervene.Rubber. On the 7th February representatives of the department saw the chairman of the Rubber National Joint Industrial Council, and discussed the possibility of a re-constitution of the Council, giving to the District Councils powers to deal with wages, the National Council acting as an appeal body in case of disagreement, and considering national questions. He was in favour of the suggestion, and promised to bring the matter before the Indiarubber Manufacturers&apos; Association on the 22nd February, with a view to a conference with the trade unions; He stated that if the proposals were carried through, he was very hopeful of the return of the Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd., to the employers&apos; association and to the Council. They had resigned solely on the question of district and national wages arrangements. He added that, so far, he and the chairman of the employers&apos; association had dissuaded the employers from moving in the direction of general wages reductions, but in view of the state of trade they felt that reductions would be inevitable.MINING.Iron Ore Miners (North Staffordshire). In consequence of trade depression the ironstone mine owners in Staffordshire have closed many of their mines, though they have paid the bonus awarded in the last coal mines settlement. It is possible that the with-drawal of this bonus might enable some of the dry mines to re-open, and arrangements are being made for a conference under an officer of the department.Iron Ore Miners (Cumberland). The majority of the iron ore mines in Cumberland have recently closed down. The workers appear to be of opinion that this is a move to effect a wages reduction. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Newcastle, is endeavouring to arrange a joint meeting for a general discussion of the situation.Lead: Proposed Reduction of Wages. The Wanlockhead and Leadhills dispute continues. On the 7th February Mr. McKerrell met the owners in Glasgow, and on the 8th February he met Mr. Smillie and representatives of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; County Union, and later presided over a joint meeting, the result of which was that Mr. Smillie said he would put all the facts before the workers at the two mines, and leave them to decide whether they would accept the proposed reduction of 25 per cent.PRINTING AND PAPER.Paper Making. The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met on the 11th February. Resolutions were passed opposing the introduction of legislation granting compulsory powers to Joint Industrial Councils, and demanding that H.M. Stationery Office should buy British paper only. A resolution was also passed approving a draft constitution for the proposed Council, and constituting the Committee a Joint Industrial Council.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Supply. Representatives of the Gloucester City Council and of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association met at headquarters, under the chairmanship of Sir David Shackleton, on the 10th February, to consider further their difference as to the schedule of salaries and conditions of employment recommended by the National Joint Board. The representatives of the City Council agreed to recommend the Council to accept, till the 30th June, the settlement suggested at Gloucester on the 28th January, namely, that the schedule of salaries be accepted and that the cost-of-living advances apply from the 1st January, 1921, and that the conditions be accepted, except that relating to sick pay, it being understood that the CounciPs practice in this matter had hitherto been satisfactory. The representatives of the Association agreed to a further suspension of notices till after the decision of the City Council, at a meeting on the 23rd February.
(The District Council for Yorkshire, excluding Cleveland, North Lincolnshire, North . Nottinghamshire and North Derbyshire, met on the 9th February. Various matters arising from the application of the schedule of basic rates and working conditions were discussed. It was reported that, as the Sheffield Corporation had refused to adopt the schedule of working conditions, serious trouble might result. A deputation was appointed to inform the Corporation Electricity Committee. It was agreed that a new overtime agreement between the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation, and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and the Electrical Trades Union, respectively, should be circulated to the undertakings for adoption. The representative of the Electrical Trades Union asked that certain classes of workmen should have new rates fixed, as the rates of the National Federated Electrical Association for similar workmen employed by contractors had recently been amended.* Local Authorities&apos; Non-trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).  A difference having arisen between the Wolverhampton Corporation and the Amalgamated Society of Gas, Municipal and General Workers, in regard to the adoption by the former of the recommendations of the West Midlands District Council for Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers) and the Midland District Council for the Water-works Undertakings Industry, the union gave notice that their members employed by the Corporation would withdraw their labour on the 9th February. The General Purposes Committee of the Town Council, having since decided to recommend the Town Council, at their meeting to be held on the 14th February, to accept the recommendations in question, the union have postponed the strike notices till the 15th February.The executive committee of the Provincial Council for the Southern Home Counties met on the 11th February. It was decided to ask the National Council to approach the Joint Conciliation Committee for the staffs of mental hospitals with a view to agreement upon a line of demarcation between employees covered by the award of the joint committee, and employees coming within the scope of the Joint Industrial Council.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Stationery Office. A special meeting of the Industrial Council was held on the 8th February, to consider short time in the Office&apos;s industrial establishments. The chairman explained that the meeting had been called to obtain the views of the trade unions. He had not yet received instructions to put a scheme into operation. The trade union side definitely refused to work short time to take on unemployed workers, and the chairman undertook to report their attitude to the Government.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Porters (Covent Garden). At the joint conference on the 9th February, it was agreed that the two unions should send in a joint claim for discussion at a further conference on the 24th February. The claim is to be in respect of the porterage scales for a period of twelve months, after which time a new system will be introduced, abolishing the payment of porterage and placing the porters on an inclusive wage scale.Warehousemen (Liverpool). From an interview with the chairman oi the Liverpool United Trades Association at headquarters on the 12th February, it appears that the union have agreed not to put into execution the strike threatened at three of the firms, and that the&quot;employers, acting on the advice of the department, are now prepared to refer the matter to the Docks Joint Council.iron mongers (Scotland). With reference to the claim* made by the National Amalga-mated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks on behalf of their members employed in the hardware and ironmongery trade, Aberdeen, a letter has been received from the union requesting the intervention of the department to bring about arbitration proceedings. Failing this, it is requested that a Court of Inquiry should be set up under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919. The department are in communication with the employers&apos; association concerned.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Insurance Workers. The strike* of insurance officials in the service of the General Accident, Fire and Life Corporation continues. The general manager has accepted the Minister&apos;s invitation to discuss the situation with him, and the 21st February has been arranged as a provisional date.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 172 to 179, 185, 186, and 193.]* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 6, 5th February, p. 138.
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS. PROCEEDINGS.Machine-Made Net and Lace Finishing Trade Board. As a result of a deputation from the Board on the question of the international regulation of wages, the Ministry-undertook to take steps to bring the question before the International Labour office at the earliest practicable moment.Milk Distributive Trade Board (Scotland). The Board resumed consideration of the objections lodged against their Notice dated the 1st November, 1920, and unanimously agreed to fix the minimum rates as set out in Parts I and II of the Notice, such rates to be based on a week of 52 hours.The Board appointed an Administrative Committee with powers to grant permits, and to act as a standing committee to whom questions might be referred by the Board from time to time.The Board considered a communication from the Ministry with regard to the granting of permits of exemption for limited periods to disabled ex-Service men, and agreed that, while full consideration would always be given to applications by disabled ex-Service men for permits, they were of opinion that each case should be dealt with on its merits.It was also agreed that legal advice should be sought as to whether commission on sales of milk can be considered wages for the purposes of the Trade Boards Acts.Paper Box Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered a letter from the Ministry on the subject of the introduction of a system of short time, and agreed to reply that the policy indicated therein is already being put into operation by the employers in the trade, but that they do not anticipate that the total number of workers in the trade at present unemployed will be absorbed thereby.The Board agreed to inform the Minister that they are fully aware of the inconvenience caused by granting permits for short periods only, that it has not been their practice to issue permits for short periods except where considered necessary in view of the circum-stances ; notwithstanding, the Board must reserve their right &quot;to deal with individual cases on their merits, having regard to the information at their disposal.Upon further consideration of the question of revising the scope of the Board, so as to exclude the manufacture of match-boxes where carried on in association with the manufacture of matches, the Board unanimously agreed to invite the Minister, or his representatives, to meet the Board to express his views as to the circumstances under which he would be disposed to withdraw any trade from the operation of the Trade Boards Acts.The Administrative Committee considered an application made to the Board to fix special minimum piece-rates for female workers, and unanimously agreed to recommend the Board to fix special minimum piece-rates, calculated on the basis of certain figures submitted in the report of an investigating officer.The committee also considered correspondence from the Ministry relating to the applicability of the Board&apos;s determinations to the manufacture of certain paper and cardboard discs, samples of which were submitted, and unanimously agreed that the manufacture of discs would appear to be within the scope of the Board only when used in connection with cream vessels.The committee unanimously agreed to recommend the Board to accept a recommenda-tion from the London District Trade Committee that no action should be taken with regard to the fixing of general minimum piece-rates for homeworkers.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board agreed to issue a Notice proposing a scheme of apprenticeship for male and female apprentices, and also proposing to vary the minimum rates for male and female learners.On. the question of differential rates for rural areas, the Board resolved to adopt the report of the committee that, owing to the practical difficulty of arriving at any satisfactory line of demarcation, they did not recommend such differentiation. With a view, however, to preventing hardship in any particular class of trade, it was agreed to refer the question of varying the minimum rates for male and female workers to the Administrative Committee, sitting as a special committee, for consideration.
General Department-continued.The proposal that packers should be excluded from the operation of the rates fixed by the Board,-except where employed in packing operations performed in a workroom, was agreed to.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Milk Distributive Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 9th February, 1921, to fix general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers.The general minimum time-rates proposed for workers, 19 years of age and over, in respect of a week of 48 hours, are as follows :-In areas administered by rural district councils, except any town or village within such area with a population exceeding 5,000, male clerks 48s. Cxi. per week, women clerks 32s. %d. per week ; roundsmen and male shop assistants 40s. per week ; roundswomen and female shop assistants 26s. H. per week ; all other male workers 38s. 3d. per week, and all other female workers 25s. 3d. per week. In all areas of the County Boroughs of Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Londonderry and Waterford and in the Dublin Metropolitan Police District, male clerks 65s. per week, female clerks 43s. Qd. per week; roundsmen and male shop assistants 53s. 3d. per week, roundswomen and female shop assistants 35s. 6(7. per week ; all other male workers 51s. per week, and all other female workers 34s. 3d. per week. In all other areas, male clerks 59s. Qd. per week, female clerks 39s. 6cl. per week, roundsmen and male shop assistants 49s. per week, roundswomen and female shop assistants 32s. Gd. per week ; all other male workers 46s. %d. per week, and all other female workers 31s. per week. Lower rates are proposed for workers under 19 years of age in each case.The proposed overtime rates for male and female workers are, for clerks, for all hours in excess of 48 in any week, time-and-a-quarter; for all other workers, for all hours in excess of 54 in any week, time-and-a-quartcr ; provided that for the first six hours in excess of 48 in any week the rate applicable is the appropriate general minimum time rate.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on pages 172, 175, 180 and 190.]EMPLOYMENT AND INSURANCE .

Reports for the week show that the industrial position, as a whole, has not grown worse. There are indeed some indications that the state of employment is likely to improve in certain occupations and districts. Reports from the textile areas and from the London area are still pessimistic in tone. The position, however, may be regarded as more hopeful in the ship-repairing industry, and in the lace, hosiery, and boot and shoe trades.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. The position on the Clyde has not improved, and the outlook is not regarded as promising, in view of the ship joiners&apos; dispute and the
decision of the society to withdraw their apprentices. It has been possible to carry on to a certain extent with apprentice labour, and this withdrawal will further curtail the employment of skilled men in other occupations. On the Tyne, Tees and Wear, workmen are still being paid off in considerable numbers as contracts are finished, and here again the effect of the joiners&apos; dispute is felt. Where construction is sufficiently advanced, vessels, together with the necessary material, are being sent to Continental yards for completion. Reports from the Mersey indicate that, while work appears to be progressing steadily, the yards are far from being busy. The improvement in ship-repair work at Barry still continues. At Bute Docks, Newport and Swansea, although there appear to be many jobs on hand, only a small number of workmen are employed. It is anticipated, however, now that there is an upward movement in shipping, due to an improvement in the coal export trade, that many repair jobs previously postponed will be put in hand. At Goole, repair work has improved, mainly as the result of the arrival of two vessels requiring extensive overhauling.Iron and Steel. Slackness is reported in the iron, steel and iron-ore mining industries in the Cleveland district, Workington, Sheffield, Scunthorpe and Kettering. At Barrow, however, four furnaces which have been idle since Christmas are about to be re-started, and a resumption of work is also expected at the ore mines in the Askam and Dalton districts. In the South Wales area the sheet mills and furnaces of the Ebbw Vale Steel Iron and Coal Co., Ltd., are about to be re-started, and at Swansea two steel furnaces have been re-started on a relay system of working.Textiles and Clothing. The report from the North-Western Division indicates that, as far as the cotton industry is concerned, the outlook is depressing. Many mills are reported to be extending their short-time working arrangements, and it would appear that further curtailment of production is becoming imperative with most firms. With regard to the general industrial position in this area, although, according to several authorities, the long expected revival of trade is to come in March, there would appear to be no prospect at present of this prediction being realised. Some slight improvement is normally looked for as spring approaches, especially in those industries, such as the hatting trade, which cater for men&apos;s and women&apos;s outdoor wear.Optimism still exists among employers in the lace trade but, owing to a further reduction in the price of cotton, which has to some extent caused prices to be less stable, the revival is not believed to be so near as was anticipated. The plain net and curtain sections are, however, showing signs of greater activity. The position of the hosiery trade is unchanged. A further slight improvement is reported in the boot and shoe industry and orders and inquiries are stated to be coming in more readily.Transport. Considerable unemployment exists among seamen and transport workers in Liverpool. Over 60 ships, representing a tonnage of 150,000 tons, are laid up in the docks. There is little activity at Hull, and the number of dock labourers idle is increasing daily. The position in South Wales, however, is improving, as a number of vessels have been released during the week. Pitwood imports continue to be good, and as the general timber season is near at hand the outlook is regarded as promising. In the Metropolitan area, work is very quiet at the docks and riverside wharves ; unemployment is consequently acute among carmen and motor and lorry drivers.Miscellaneous. In the Metropolitan area the general slackness continues, the industries most affected being engineering, leather, tin-box making, and the food product trades. The demand for bricklayers and plasterers continues to be brisk, and, although a number of orders have been cancelled during the week, the demand still greatly exceeds the supply.  The improvement in the painting and decorating section continues.Industrial Developments. At Kingston-on-Thames the American Engineering Co. are opening part of the factory recently occupied by the Sopwith Aviation and Engineering Co., Ltd. At Sheerness the Medway Glass Works are now engaged on productive work, and it is expected that additional workers will be required from time to time. The Queen-borough Shipbuilding Co., formed with a view to developing Queenborough as a trading port with the Continent, have already engaged a nucleus staff through the Exchange.Labour Reductions. Longton report that 300 men have been discharged by the Florence Coal and Iron Co., Ltd. At Oswestry the Porthywaen lime quarry, employing 260 workpeople, and the Lilleshall quarry, employing 80 workpeople, have been closed down owing to slackness of trade.Upwards of 200 workpeople employed by the Yorkshire Coking and Chemical Co., Ltd., Castleford, have been discharged.  At Chesterfield 40 men have been suspended(b 16989T) 2 B
by the Renishaw Iron Co., Ltd., and 30 pit-top men have been discharged from the Elkington Collieries, Ltd.   At Hyde, 180 workers have been discharged by Rexine, Ltd.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation. The week&apos;s statistics show an increase4in both unemployment and under-employment, and generally there is little change in the situation.The heaviest unemployment is again shown to be in the textile industries which, on the 21st January, showed 80,000 totally unemployed workers and 190,000 short-time workers, and in the engineering and metal trades, which showed approximately 35,000 totally unemployed and 9,000 short-time workers.The highest figures occur in the London and South-Eastern Division with approxi-mately 64,000 on the live register, on the 28th January, and the North-Western Division with nearly 58,000.The general situation in the divisions shows little change.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that there is no improvement in the textile industry and the more hopeful note of the last two weeks is not maintained. Firms previously working three days a week are in many cases now working only two days or are closed down altogether.At Darwen information has been received that 12 additional mills are closing down during the week. Two firms in the area of the Farnworth Exchange, who resumed full-time working three weeks ago, have been compelled to revert to short time. In the majority of the mills at Glossop, where a three-day system of short time is in operation, weavers are, in many cases, working two looms instead of four.At Heywood the improvement reported last week is not permanent, as there is a prospect of more mills closing down during the week. The Preston Exchange state that the cotton trade in this district is absolutely paralysed and no improvement is expected before the end of March.Other industries in the division continue depressed and general unemployment is affecting the businesses of small retailers.The woollen textile trade continues to show marked depression in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division. The wholesale clothing industry, blouse making, hosiery, velvet cutting and lace manufacturing are all gravely depressed. At Morley there are nearly 4,000 workers on the register, the greater number in the textile trade. At Tod-morden approximately 3,000 cotton workers are claiming unemployment insurance benefit although the majority of these are short-time workers.In the South Midlands and Eastern Division the important industry of boot and shoe making shows no improvement. . At Northampton a further number of factories are working less time. It is, however, reported from this town that a more hopeful feeling prevails as regards the near future. Small decreases of the register are reported from Leicester and Kettering, probably due to exhaustion of benefit.Reports from the large industrial centres of the West Midlands Division remain gloomy. The live register at Birmingham continues to increase, and the unemployment situation is said to be worse. At Aston there is a slight improvement in the rubber industry, work having in some cases increased from three to five days a week. In the pottery centres a number of workers are on short time and the live registers are increasing.The grave unemployment in the factory areas of London, which has now been reported for months past, remains unabated, and amongst the unemployed are tailoresses, leather workers, tin box makers, jam makers, rubber workers, brush makers, and workers in the furnishing, paper, printing, pianoforte and toy making trades. An increased number of firms are working short time; at Shoreditch over 61 firms have now made short-time arrangements with the Employment Exchange. The Great Marlborough Street Exchange, however, report that the revival in the dressmaking and sewing trades reported last week has been well maintained.A special effort to stimulate recruitment on behalf of the Metropolitan Asylums Board was made in October, 1920, and a printed leaflet giving terms and conditions of service for the use of prospective applicants was prepared on behalj of the Board. Approximately 100 applicants have been placed in this work as probationers and domestics, from October to February, the largest numbers having been submitted by the South Midlands and Eastern, London and South-Eastern, Wales and Northern Divisions. There is still an unsatisfied demand for 135 workers as probationers and domestics, in addition to a large demand for staff nurses.
The staple industries in the South-Western Division remain depressed. At Bridg-water, 747 workers are affected, the majority of whom are on short time. Further dis-charges are reported at Gloucester and Bristol. There are 363 women unemployed at Swindon, amongst them many tailoresses and shirt machinists. At Yeovil there are over 400 short-time workers in the glove industry.There is little change in the situation in Wales where there is still some depression in the tinplate industry.Local industries remain depressed in the Northern Division. There are between 500 and 600 women on the live register and nearly 1,000 workers on short time at Carlisle, where the biscuit industry is depressed. Other depressed industries in this city are the textile, woollen manufacture, calico printing and cotton spinning. At Gateshead there is a register of over 700 women. In other parts of the area tailoresses, dressmakers and ropery workers are unemployed.In Scotland no improvement is reported in the textile industries and marked depression is still shown in the textile and woollen industries, in calico printing, in the linen and flax works, and in the jute, hosiery, carpet and lace trades. Dressmakers are said to be returning to work in Edinburgh, but fresh applications keep the register at a high figure.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Unemployment. There is evidence that the establishment of the Unemployment Grants Committee has stimulated Local Employment Committees to see that no opportunity is lost for obtaining grants to relieve unemployment. The Hereford Com-mittee, having approached the County Council with various recommendations, and having received no reply to any of their recommendations, have now approached each member of the Council personally, This committee also called attention to the impending closing of the National Filling Factory at Hereford and the consequent unemployment of from 400 to 500 men. The committee see no reason why the factory should not be kept on, especially as the work being done namely, the breaking down of shrapnel results in a profit of about  10,000 per week from this factory alone. The Southampton Com-mittee are calling attention to a local common occupied during the war by the military authorities, and wish pressure to he brought to bear on those authorities to restore the common to its former condition; they are also asking the department to press upon the Air Ministry the need for effecting a settlement with a local Council regarding damage done during the war to certain roads. This would be the means of providing work for a number of unemployed.Unemployment Insurance Benefit. The Barrow Committee are desirous that arrange-ments should be made with the Postmaster-General to allow applicants for benefit residing in outlying districts t&apos;o receive their benefit at the nearest Post Office. The Chesterfield Committee are of opinion that the rates of benefit are totally inadequate, and that the Government should be urged to make additional allowances for dependants. This matter has been raised by several committees ; there also seems to be a large volume of opinion, amongst the committees that the rule, limiting to 90 days the amount of benefit that can be drawn in any one year, should be relaxed at the present time.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation.-Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 3rd February, show 334,266 payments to policy-holders, involving an amount of  311,007 16s. 10c?.Unemployment Insurance. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 28th January was 669,609, involving an amount of  379,454 13s. U.DISCHARGED  AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme. Up to and including the 9th February certificates have been issued to 24,097 employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 268,032 disabled ex-Service men.The continued industrial depression has. for the time being adversely affected progress, but several of the Divisional Controllers are contemplating a further extensive campaign among employers as soon as conditions become more settled.(b 16989T) 2 B 2
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 4th February, the Appointments Department placed 385 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 49,615. Of these, 6,718 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 799 ex-Service men and 26 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 4th February was 10,858 ex-Service men and 1,418 civilians. At the same date 975 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the departmeno, 441 having been registered during the week.Reports from Districts. The Director at Leeds reports that vacancies are extremely difficult to obtain, but those registered are of a very superior type and command good salaries, three registered during the week being at over  1,000 a year.The Director at Cardiff reports that placings show an increase in spite of the dislocation of trade. One interesting placing was that of an applicant who joined the Army straight from school and has lost both legs. A special canvass was made on his behalf, and he was placed with one of the largest firms in the district at a commencing salary of  200 per annum, with excellent prospects.The Director at Cambridge reports that in spite of the depression in engineering a member of the Luton Board has succeeded in placing a candidate in this industry at a salary of about  600 per annum.JUVENILE BRANCH.Effect of Trade Board Rates on Juvenile Employment-The results of an inquiry into the effect of the wages fixed by the Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board on the employ-ment of apprentices in these trades has been presented to the Cardiff Juvenile Employment Committee by their executive officer. The general conclusion arrived at is that, while some form of control was necessary to prevent the exploitation of juveniles, the learners&apos; rates now in force are unduly high and are seriously restricting the number of openings available. It is stated that since the operation of these rates commenced wholesale dismissals of the less efficient girls have taken place, and that the number of apprentices now employed in Cardiff is only half what it would otherwise have been.As regards the effect on continuity of employment, employers in the millinery trade are said to be considering the advisability of dismissing girls at the end of one season and engaging a fresh set when required, instead of wholly or partially suspending their original girls as was the previous practice during slack periods. It is also stated that the difference in the rate of wages payable to girls entering the trade at the ages of 14 and 16 will certainly result in preference being given to the younger and cheaper girl. Employers say that the possibility that the older girl might have a better standard of education would count for very little.Apprenticeship: Distributive Trades. The Kingston-on-Thames Juvenile Advisory Committee, in co-operation with the Chamber of Commerce, have drafted a scheme of apprenticeship for the distributive trades, which has been referred to the National Amal-gamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks for consideration.The main proposals are that premiums should be optional; that the length of appren-apprenticeship should be four years ; that the wages for each successive year of apprenticeship should be one-sixth, one-fifth, one-fourth and one-third, respectively, of the standard adult rate ; that the hours be 48 a week, exclusive of meal times, but inclusive of day continuation school attendance; that six days&apos; annual leave, and up to six weeks&apos; sick leave with pay, be allowed yearly; and that a certificate of efficiency be given by the employer on completion of apprenticeship. Provision is also made for the establishment of an apprenticeship committee to settle any questions of dispute.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 172 to 175, 180, 181, 183, 185, 193 and 194.]
19110.8.21.BUSINESS AND  PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 4th February the Appointments Department received 22 applications for training under this scheme, of which 18 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting can-cellations and withdrawals, 28,191 applications for training of this type have been received in all, and 49,623 for the types provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt to date with 27,747 applications, of which 23,260 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 22,139 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,322 cases.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 4th February the Appoint-ments Department received 111 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 2,163, of which 498 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 416 cases. At the same date 309 &quot; live &quot; training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 53 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with a total of 1,031 cases, in 468 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 280 cases, and abandoned training in 46 ; 128 are still in training and 14 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics.-On the 8th February 25,135 men were in training, as against 25,185 on the 1st February and 25,010 on the 11th January. More than 500 men were placed in training during the week. There were 16,157 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 1st February and the 11th January being 16,181 and 16,293, respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 25,554, the totals for the 1st February and the 11th January being 24,990 and 23,734, respectively.Reports for the month of January show little material change, and mainly serve to indicate that the past two or three months have been a period of marking time. The slight increase in numbers in training is mainly accounted for by extensions granted under the special powers allowed to Divisional Directors in view of the prevailing difficulties in finding improvership vacancies. The fact that the waiting list continues to fall, however slightly, must be regarded as satisfactory, as the number of new names added during the month was nearly 2,700, a considerable increase on the previous month&apos;s figures.As regards the discovery of improvership vacancies, it has been recommended that the help of the local officers of the Apprenticeship Branch should be enlisted as far as possible. This form of co-operation already exists in one or two divisions, and there seems to be good reason to believe that it should prove of very material assistance.Exhibitions. It is hoped that the Ministry&apos;s display at the Daily Mail Efficiency Exhibition will stimulate the interest of employers and members of trade unions, who are expected to attend in large numbers. The high class of the workmanship should convince the employer that in accepting trained men for improvership periods, he is taking really promising recruits into his workshop, while the member of a union will be able to realise that the trained ex-Service man is likely to prove a worthy member of his craft.The Norwich Factory was recently honoured by a visit from their Majesties the King and Queen, and Princess Mary. The Chief Technical Officer for the area has since re-ceived a letter from H.M. the Queen&apos;s private secretary expressing her great interest in what she saw, and her willingness to accept a pair of shoes made by disabled men in training at the factory.Institutional Training. All the men who are receiving institutional training in the Middlesex area are being instructed under Government Instructional Factory conditions. Except as regards certain classes at the Willesden Polytechnic, which takes rank as a Govern-ment Instructional Factory, all the accommodation which was placed at the disposal of the Ministry of Pensions and the Ministry of Labour by the local educational authority has now been released.  The tendency to concentrate institutional training in the Government
Instructional Factory is a common feature in the majority of the divisions, but up to the present it has undoubtedly been carried out in Middlesex more completely than elsewhere.A large number of the men trained at Clark&apos;s College, Bristol, have passed the examina-tions of the London Chamber of Commerce with distinctions. One man, disabled in the right arm, who has acquired a shorthand speed of 120 words a minute with his left hand and is able to transcribe his notes within the period usually allowed, was awarded a &quot; Teacher&apos;s Diploma,&quot; a particularly meritorious distinction.Government Instructional Factories. During the week ended the 5th February, there was an increase of 134 men on the rolls, bringing the total number of men training under factory conditions up to 9,905. Since the 28th December, there has been an increase of 883, a number which might have been considerably higher but for the restrictions on admissions now imposed by certain trades.The numbers at the new Belfast Factory, which came on to the active list on the 19th January, have risen to 164. The work of equipping and renovating the factory is proceeding satisfactorily, and men in training are assisting in the painting of the factory. At Guildford the men in carpentry and joinery classes are being usefully employed in the construction of a timber store, and window sashes for the factory, and also on benches, stools, tables and cupboards for watchmakers&apos; and tailors&apos; classes in other instructional factories.The results of the prevailing depression in the engineering trade are beginning to be felt at Twickenham somewhat severely. Applications from employers for men trained in the factory are scarce, and until the hoped-for trade revival takes place it may be neces-sary to retain a considerable proportion of the men in training.On the 9th February the Minister inspected the Harlesden Factory, and presented medals and certificates to men in the tailoring course who had proved successful in the Tailor and Gutter competition last month. Later in the day the Minister visited the Chis-wick Factory and inspected the work of the men under training in the building and furniture-ture trades. These classes are all engaged on productive work ; the building trade classes have recently carried out contract work for the Chiswick Urban District Council, while the furniture trade classes have been employed on equipment for various other factories, as well as school furniture for an important education authority.Local Technical Advisory Committees : Gold, Silver, and Allied Trades. The inaugural meeting of the Cardiff Committee was held on the 3rd February. It has been necessary to appoint this committee to supervise the training of Cardiff men transferred from the Swansea class. The inaugural meeting of the High Wycombe committee was also held during the week. The members agreed to proceed at once with the scheme, and recom-mended that a start should be made with a.class of 10 men.tApprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 9th February, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 45,633 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanc-tioned in respect of 43,613 apprentices, employed by 17,371 employers.* The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 18,257.^Applications. A further report from the South Midlands and Eastern Area suggests doubts whether the position there is as favourable as was previously reported. The returns of &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices indicated that only in one district, Ipswich, were any number of cases outstanding, and it was specially visited by local headquarters. It was then found that the number outstanding was greater than was previously reported. Local headquarters are inquiring whether similar cases exist in other parts of their area.Owing to the growing unemployment, men whose employers have refused to accept them, and who have since been employed under other arrangements, are renewing their applications. In Wales some men in this position have been employed, and paid, as improvers, but, in the absence of any agreement, have recently been suspended. They are, in consequence, endeavouring to come under the scheme.In the South-Western area efforts continue to be made on behalf of the &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices, but owing to the general state of trade and the large numbers of ordinary apprentices in many engineering firms in the area, local headquarters are not confident of finding employers to accept them. .       -* Revised figures.
Non-observance of Conditions. The Barry Dock Steam Pilot Cutter Co. persist in refusing to observe their agreements, the chief point at issue being the reduction in the term of apprenticeship. The company refuse to recede from their contention that a minimum of five years is essential to a mastery of the Bristol Channel, and a deadlock has been reached. They signed the agreements some months ago, but now urge that, as the original indentures were entered into by individual pilots, the company, as such, had no power to take this step, and the agreements are therefore invalid.Unemployment. In the South-Western area the number of apprentices under the engineering scheme, who have been unemployed, or suspended, continues to increase ; and the position in this respect, as in regard to the placing of &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices, appears to be affected unfavourably by the very large numbers of fitters&apos; and turners&apos; apprentices in many parts of the district. In the Welsh tinplate industry, in spite of the large numbers unemployed or on short time, very few of the apprentices on the maintenance staffs appear so far to have been affected.Institutional Training. Progress is reported in providing additional facilities to meet the still increasing demands for institutional training. At the Leeds Technical College, whole-time courses are being arranged for 32 apprentices in engineering, and for 18 in tailoring. In the London engineering industry, whole-time institutional training has hitherto been impossible to provide, unless the apprentices take a three years&apos; course, which cannot be done under the scheme. The matter has been taken up with the Educa-tion Department of the London County Council, who will consider the provision of such a course, if a certain number of apprentices can be provided. They have made a similar offer for a course in the furniture industry. At Oldham, it is hoped to establish a full-time course for apprentice fitters and turners. At the Robert Gordon Technical Institute Aberdeen, a special class for engineers already exists, and, in view of further applications, negotiations are proceeding for the establishment of a second.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. The national scheme is reported to have been formally adopted by the Area Joint Councils for the Midlands and for the Southern Counties. The Midland Joint Council cover parts of the South Midlands and Eastern Area of the Training Department, and their decision is expected to facilitate the adoption of the scheme in these districts. In some places, however, no steps appear yet to have been taken by the industry to establish local apprenticeship committees.On Tees-side, the employers desire to consider the scheme separately before discussing it with the operatives, and arrangements are being made for them to hold a separate meeting in March, to cover practically the whole of Tees-side. It is hoped that a joint conference will be held shortly after. It is not unlikely that three local committees will eventually be established in the district, for Middlesbrough, for the Hartlepools, and for Stockton and Thornaby.Apprenticeship : Engineering. Further evidence is available of the large proportion of apprentices to journeymen in the fitting and turning branches in the South-west of England, which is so large as to place them out of balance with the rest of the industry. As, apparently, the places of apprentices who went on service were filled by others, their return is increasing the difficulty. There is reason to believe, indeed, that in some dis-tricts the average proportion of apprentices in these trades is as high as one to two journey-men ; and in this respect the information given by employers tends to corroborate that of the trade unions.Apprenticeship : Printing. A model indenture has been drawn up for the National Society of Electrotypers and Stereotypers, which it is expected will be adopted by many firms in London. It lays down a scale of wages for apprentices ranging from 20 to 75 per cent, of the journeyman&apos;s rates, a proportion slightly higher than that of the building scheme; it provides for compulsory attendance at technical classes, partly in the employees, and partly in the apprenticed time.The general secretary of the society considers that at present workshop training is seldom completely satisfactory, that little provision is made for supervision ; that appren-tices have been &quot; pitchforked &quot; into the trade, some suitable, some eminently unsuitable ; and that few shops can provide the necessary scientific and technical knowledge. A South London firm hold that the actual instruction at technical schools is of little value, though they encourage attendance, as making the boys think.  The defect assigned is that at
the school they work under ideal conditions, using the best materials and devoting ample time and care to the production, while in the shop the material is not always the best, and results have to be produced quickly. The firm are endeavouring to avoid employing boys upon unskilled work and are substituting girls. The important firm of Messrs. T. De La Rue &amp; Co., London, have had a works school for the last 18 months, at which 130 boys receive technical and theoretical instruction.In Devonshire and Cornwall there are no facilities for technical instruction in this industry ; but one firm have established a class in their works, which is conducted by their manager. The instruction is both practical and theoretical, and the boys who attend have shown great interest, having purchased an expensive set of books upon process en-graving. The results in the works have been gratifying. The firm previously had diffi-culty in getting jobbing hands for rush days; but the apprentices now give the regular journeyman so much assistance at these times that the firm have dispensed altogether with casual labour.As regards lithographers, employers have objected that the recognised proportion of one apprentice to five journeymen, with a maximum of eight, is too small. The secre-tary of the union, however, reports that a rough census of the industry recently showed that, taking the country as a whole, there were vacancies for 300 more apprentices than are employed at present.Apprenticeship : Other Industries. At Glasgow, apprenticeship to the trade of saw doctor is reported to be dying out, owing to the rise of a class of semi-skilled men who travel from one works to another to sharpen the saws. Consequently a skilled saw doctor is employed only on jobs which are too difficult for the semi-skilled men to handle. Owing, however, to the decrease in the numbers entering the trade, none of the skilled men appear to be unemployed. In the case of wheelwrights at Swansea, the employers&apos; secretary considers that with the present amount of work it is absurd to expect boys to serve an apprenticeship, and the local journeyman&apos;s rate is said to be no higher than that paid to a dustman. In the brush-making industry in London, a great scarcity of skilled men is reported; the men, though paid to teach apprentices, are said to be reluctant to do so. Complaint is also made that a very small proportion of apprentices is allowed.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments wilt also be found on pages 180, 185,186 and 190.]
