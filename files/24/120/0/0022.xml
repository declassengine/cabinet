[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]      \Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1921.CONFIDENTIAL.__ uR221*/^PROPOSED CHANGE IN THE STATUS OF EGYPT.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum by the Chief of the Air Stan; on the proposed change in the status of Egypt.February 1921.Air Staff Memorandum on the Proposed Change in thb Status of Egypt.The Air Staff has had under review the proposals for a changed status of Egypt, and wish to amplify, in the light of various Cabinet papers that have been circulated, their memorandum of the 25th August on this subject. (See Appendix II to C.P.-1803.)The Value of Egypt to the Air Force.The value of Egypt to the Air Force is comprised in the following:  1. Her position as a junction of aerial and wireless communications.In this respect the position of Egypt is unique. 2,300 miles from London, 3,000 from Bombay, 5,000 from Cape Town, she stands at the main cross-roads of our aerial highways. Malta is 1,200 miles, Bagdad 850, Khartoum 1,000 and Aden 1,600 miles; all of these are important centres of British influence and within the reach of low powered wireless sets.The value of Egypt in any scheme of Imperial communication is thus self-evident; no other country can take its place.2. Her command over the narrowest and most easily-blocked sea passage on the shortest route to the East.The vital importance of the Suez Canal to the sea communications of the British Empire is an axiom; its peculiar danger lies in the fact that it is the narrowest and most easily-blocked portion of our only short route to the East. Egypt commands the canal throughout its length, and though her people may not be martially inclined, it does not require an extensive military operation to cause interruption of traffic. Apart from such military operation, surprise aerial attack on a series of ships in the canal would result in a serious blockage at a time when the smallest interruption of commu-nications might have the most serious results. A large portion of the Air Force is constantly operating in the East, and until our Eastern dependencies develope, these forces are based on the United Kingdom for purposes of technical supply.3. Her value as a convenient central base for the Eastern organisation of the Royal Air Force.The Air Force in the Near and Middle East requires a centre closer than Great Britain from which its work may be supervised, on which it may to some extent (increasing as years go by) be based, and where its semi-mobile reserve for the various theatres may be stationed in a climate comparable to that they may be called upon to endure in Eastern service. The position of Egypt on the highway of seaborne traffic between Europe and the East (including East Africa) is such that no other theatre could so well serve the purposes of the Royal Air Force as a Central Eastern base.[4956]
A base for aircraft working with the navy is essential to the senior service in the Eastern Mediterranean. The northern coast of Egypt offers the most favourable site for such a base. ,4. Her convenience as a training ground for Iioyal Air Force personnel.The climate of Egypt renders the country peculiarly suitable for flying training. Not only is the weather uniformly fine, but personnel become to some extent acclimatised and prepared for the conditions they will meet further east.The importance of Egypt to the Iioyal Air Force has led to the establishment of large training stations, workshops and depots in the country, and large expenditure has been incurred thereon ; it is important from a strategical, economical and administrative point of view that the facilities for air work so laboriously built up shall not be impeded by any change of status of the country. The Air Force is only now in a process of formation ; disorganisation at this stage of its growth will delay for years the fulfilment of its possibilities.The Effect of the Milner Proposals.The original press report of the proposals of Lord Milner&apos;s Commission alluded to the withdrawal of the British garrison to a small enclave on the Canal and its reduction to a figure of 3,000-5,000 all ranks. It is now seen that this assumption was incorrect, and Lord Milner states that the treaty to be concluded should enable us to keep such forces in the country as we require for Imperial purposes and station these at such points as we desire.   This is satisfactory if it is really feasible.But is it possible to keep large military establishments in an independent country in which we have no responsibility for maintaining law and order arid no control in peace over essential communications, such as roads, railways and telegraphs ? Would there not be considerable difficulty in persuading the&apos;Egyptian Government that such a scheme was not, in practice, a veiled &quot; occupation &quot;? And is there not more than a possibility that to get rid of British occupation, rather than the achievement of independence, may once more speedily become the platform of the Egyptian &quot; Nationalists&quot; of the future ? For the present, Lord Milner assures us that the extremists alone demand the complete removal of British troops ; but who is to say that the future rale of the country may not be extremist in tendency?There are, therefore, political difficulties to the maintenance in peace of British troops in an independent Egypt, and these may be intensified in case of war. The British Government is to have a somewhat nebulous control over Egyptian foreign policy, but we may find ourselves fighting an Arab State, not actually allied to Egypt (granted that our control of policy is real), but with whom the Egyptians are in fullest sympathy. Our air operations would necessarily be based on Egypt, and our position would be intolerable. Such difficulties may well increase if pan-Islamism becomes a real force, for our possible enemies in the neighbourhood of Egypt will be largely-Mohammedan.Internally the situation may well become unsatisfactory; there is nothing to prevent the Egyptians from adopting conscription and raising an army formidable in numbers if not in fighting temper. The danger is admittedly not great, but it must not be overlooked. On the other hand, Egypt may neglect her fighting and police forces, and be unable to repress disorders consequent on a venal administration. The situation of British troops &quot; for Imperial purposes &quot; in the midst of a disorderly and discontented population would be unenviable, and incidents could easily arise which would lead to international complications. The Air Force is intimately concerned in this matter since air units cannot be stationed in countries of potential unrest without a garrison of army troops. Again, should the Egyptians neglect their fighting forces, the British people will have to shoulder an unwarrantable burden to guarantee the country against outside aggression, and the calls on the British fighting services may be greatly increased and uncontrollable.If it is difficult to imagine a satisfactory position in the present time, the future appears to offer -further possibilities of trouble. What is to happen if a future Government of Egypt desires to repudiate the treaty with Great Britain ? Are they to be coerced into its retention by force of arms ? Such action is hardly consistent with the principles of self-determination. Or having granted independence, must we abandon what we-cannot retain by peaceful means ? The answers to the questions must be given by politicians, but the Air Service is unwilling to build up an organisation of which the
keystone is liable to be removed at the whim of an unstable people and bring the whole edifice tumbling to the ground.Lastly, and in the distant future an independent Egypt can raise an air force of any desired magnitude. It will be long before this will be formidable in technique, but the possible danger of such a force astride of our communications to the East is out of all proportion to its technical perfection. An excuse that it is for the maintenance of internal security alone would exempt it from interference from us till a crisis actually arose, and the delay caused by dealing with the menace in an adequate manner before reinforcements could be sent to a far Eastern theatre might be a deciding factor in operations, if we were confronted with a major war in such theatres.Air Staff, February 1921.Suggested Treaty Clauses for Safeguarding Air Force Interests.The peculiar value of Egypt to the Air Force has been shown above and the effect of the Milner Commission^ proposals has been examined. The safeguarding of Air Force interests is difficult, but the following provisions in the treaty-which, it is presumed, will be made may afford some measure of security : 1. The strength of the Air Force to be maintained in Egypt will be as required for Imperial purposes.2. Its distribution will be as necessitated for those purposes, and particularly (a.) To maintain and guard communications, Imperial and local.ib.) To co-operate, as required, with the Navy and Army,(c.) To form a reserve for the Air Forces in Eastern theatres.(d.) To provide training establishments for Air Force personnel.3. In the case of war outside Egypt, facilities are to be offered as follows : (a.) To use Egypt as a base.(6.) To move freely over or control railways.(c.) To control telegraphs, signals and wireless, and to establish a censorship as necessary.4. Disciplinary clauses should confer : (a.) The right to carry arms at all times.(6.) The right of British airmen to trials for civil offences by British and not local civil courts.(c.) The right to maintain order among airmen in towns by means of Air Force police patrols. k(d.) Permission to employ native labour as needed, and to enlist Egyptian personnel if required.5. Material concessions desired are : (a.) Free import of Air Force stores.(6.) Choice of training localities as desired for the Air Force.(c.) Acquisition and security of tenure of land and buildings required forAir Force purposes. (d.) Facilities for storage of petrol and the supply thereof if found in quantity in Egypt, (e.) Facilities for the establishment of strategical aerial routes. (/.) The right to erect wireless stations and to run telegraph and telephonelines for Air Force purposes. (g.) Port and rail facilities to be freely offered in peace as well as war onreasonable terms. (h.) Permission to start aircraft munition works and factories.
6. Other clauses should provide for (a.) Freedom of passage of our &quot;military&quot; aircraft at all times. (b.) Permission for warships (&quot;aircraft carriers&quot;) to enter ports at all times.(c.) A guarantee of the security of the fresh water canal. (d.) The limitation of the size of the Air Force permitted to be maintained by Egypt.(e.) Aircraft material used by the Egyptian State for service purposes should he of British pattern and supplied by British firms.(/.) The Egyptian Air Service must not utilise the services of instructors from foreign Powers other than Great Britain.
