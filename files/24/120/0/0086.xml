Tho Assembly has undertaken the study of tho question of tho Blockade.      Tho task which it has entrusted to us is fairly straightforward at present, as it merely involves tho creation of en International Blockade Commission, in conformity with the principles which have already boon laid down by tho Assembly.      This Commission is to consist of a maximum of 8 members, of whom 4 may belong to States which are permanently represented on the Council.      In respect of the other members, it is rather by considorations of a geographical nature that our choice should bo guided, having regard to tho different aspects which tho Blockade problem may assume in relation to tho coographical situation of any country.   The choico might lie between tho South American, tho Scandinavian and the   Central European States.As the blockade is a very intricate subject - for it include!.-; questions of a political, legal, economic and military nature - the members of the Oommission, who should, preferably, be politicians, would be authorised to seek: tho advice of exports on special points.
