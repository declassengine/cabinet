CABINET.LIQUOR     CONTROL (a). DILUTION OF SPIRITS (b) RESTRICTIONS ON CLUBSMEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLERDILUTION OP SPIRITS.It       With reference to Item 4 of the second paragraph of the Liquor Control Board&apos;s oettor pf the 28th February, (C.P.-2645), it has always been tho view of my advisers that the prescribed dilution of spirits has tended to increase insobriety by inducing the habit of consuming double whiskies, either neat or slightly diluted, with the result that the habitual spirit drinker now consumes his alcohol in a more concentrated form than before the War.I suggest that the extent to which spirits may be diluted without notice to the purchaser should be limited to a strength falling between 20 degrees and 35 degrees under proof. This amendment would, I believe, tend to reduce insobriety rather than increase it.RESTRICTIONS PIT CLUBS:2.       The Beard state that they have sought to meet complaints that the existing restrictions are unnecessarily or irritatingly severe. No    where is irritation more intense than among members of Working Men1a Clubs, who strongly resent the continuance of restrictions imposed on these clubs during the War.   I have re-ceived representations on behalf of the Working Menfs Cluba and Institute Union, the Association of Conservative Clubs, and ttye Federation of Liberal Clubs, urging that the position of clubs ought to be dealt with immediately as a question separate from the Government&apos;s general licensing proposals.3,       The number of club members represented by these organiaa-tions is about two million, and they claim that their views are shared by a million^and^a.*half members of the 5,000 Working Men&apos;s Clubs not affiliated to these organisations.4.       The war-time restrictions to which the clubs object are?-(a) The limitation of hours during which intoxicants may be supplied, and .(b) The right of entry for inspection purposes possessed by every polioe officer of the rank of Inspector.5.       They are asking for the fulfilment of what they regard as a pledge   given by the Prime Minister on the 29th April, 1915, when, in announcing the intention of the Government to set up the Liquor Control Board, he said &quot;We propose to take powers limited to the period of the War, because we do not want to raise any issue beyond that.&quot; Sir John Simon, on the 13th October, 1915, in asking fov leave to introduce the Clubs (Temporary
Provisions ) Bill, also said &quot;there is no intention of altering the law relating to clubs for any permanent purpose. The proposal is simply to make a temporary change for the period of the War&quot;*6.       The Clubs object to being asked to wait for the Licensing Bill.   They point out that until the introduction of the Liquor Control (Temporary Provisions) Bill last Session it had never been sought to put clubs upon the same footing as licensed houses. They quote the finding of the Royal Commission on Liquor Licensing LaW3* 1899, that &quot;the essential difference between a club and a licensed house must be borne In mind.  A club is a private insti-tution and necessarily enjoys &amp; liberty in many matters which is not permitted to licensed houses&quot;.7.       They do not desire that clubs should be kept open for un-reasonable hours, but they submit that a club should be allowed to soil intoxicants for a reasonable number of hours in the day (they suggest nine), and to arrange those hours of sale in the way most suitable to its membership.   They are thus asking for romothing much less than tho total restoration of their pre-war privileges.8.       On the subject of inspection they point out that prior to the War no inspector had the right of entry to a club unless he wore possessed of a Magistrate^ warrant. Thoy desire to bo free   from constant inspection by tho police under the war-time powers, which they regard as unnecessarily oppressive.9.       It would appear that tho Clubs1 requests could be met without legislation.   They seem to       involve only an amendment of the Orders issued by the Liquor Control Board and the revocation of any orders issued by the Secretary of State under Clause 1(1) of the clubs (Temporary Provisions) Act.10.      I gather that the clubs intend to commence vigorous propaganda, and I suggest that the Cabinet should give the matter immediato consideration.CHARLES A.McCURDY.MINISTRY OP POOD.March 3rd 1921.
