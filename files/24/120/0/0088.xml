This line will also be employed in the repatriation of Russian refugees from the United States of America.   Reports state that there are about 2 million of these people for repatriation.NORWAY.A small Commission of Naval and Military experts are visiting Armament Firms in the United Kingdom.
H 0 L L A N D.The Dutch Press repots that Conciliation Boards, composed of all ranks, will be established to discuss and rodress grievances in tho Navy.I T A L Y,ThQ Port of Cattaro is declared infected, and ships calling In Italy coining from that port are subject to Hygienic Regulations regarding pest, cholera and favor.It is reported that the first Italian &quot;Commercial Cruiso*   in tho form of a Floating Fair, in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, is to bo taken by the Royal Yacht &quot;Trinacria&quot;, leaving Naples on 5th May, 1921 and calling at the following portsMalta, Rodi, Alexandria, Bengasis, Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, Casablanca, Lisbon, Barcelona, Marseilles, Genoa.The cruise is supposod to last about 75 days.DANUBE.The Conference of Ambassadors has decided that tho Sub-Commission for the disposal of enemy vessels is to be authorised to hand over to tho International Danube converted -\ission the three monitors which have been assigned to that Commission, as soon as the contract for their disarms-rnent has been signed.It ha? also been dociood that this Sub-Committee is to be dissolved.

(British) from Barbados on,   Tho technical objection &apos;that it is a partly British oporated line, but it is ^on^idored probable that the All American Cables Company, which operate an alternative route to South America via Central&apos;&quot;America, are still bringing pressure to bear on the U.3. Government to prevent this new competition, in spite of the decision of tho Toderal Court which gave&apos; a verdict im favour of the Western Union Company.
Internal Conditions.Continuous reports *wwe been  received stating that White insurgents, termed t^e Social Revolutionary Party, have overcome the Soviet Government.    Undoubtedly fighting is taking v-iace, but reliable authorities consider that the Soviet Government win ultimately crush these risings, which have begun primarily on account op scarcity of food supplies.Rod Amy,     A copy of General Brussiloff* s report to the Soviet Government has been received.      The Army consists of 23 armies divided amongst the various fronts, with a total of all ranks of about 1,500,000.    The shortage of heavy and light artillery is acute.    There is considerable discontent owing&apos; to the holding up of tho recent demobilisation orders. The Ozarist Officers have proved loyal and to be the backbone of the Officer cadre.    They are well treated, and inducements of food and pay keep them loyal.The Communist Of floors on the other hand are of poor quality and their chief characteristic is homesickness. Brussiloff estinat *s   that of the rank and file \?$ are Communists, 30tf sympathisers and remainder are neutral, but a strong distaste for continued hostilities is shown by all. He is strongly opposed to the militia system as a substitute to the standing army.    The Council agreed that the Army must be kept employed as &quot;want of work is demoralising&quot;.   Partial demobilisation and a system of reliefs on the fronts have been authorised.The anti-Semitic feeling is on the increase and the demand for a Constituent Assembly is becoming more insistent.Lithuania.The Council op the League of Nations have decided that it is no longer possible to proceed with the Vilna plebiscite ooheme, owing&apos; to difficulties Interposed by Poles and Lithuanians and the delay in completing a plebiscite. As an alternative,   it is proposed that the two parties should meet at Brussels under the Presidency of ?&apos;\ Hymans to endeavour to arrive at a solution of the difficulty.    Both parties have accepted this proposal.Georgia.The Rising at Oni is regarded seriously and   the Georgians have sent extra  troops there several times.   Sukhum was taken by the Bolsheviks on 3rd March.    The Georgians are holding the line of t*e Fodo (?h) River.      About 10,00 Turks are at Borohka.    The Georgian Government intend, as soon as the Suram front is consolidated, to one neaoe negotiations with Moscow by W/T on the basisRestitution of all Invaded territory. Submission to Court of Arbitration of all disputed questions between Georgia and Russia.PART   II.General   Intelligence RUSSIA.
Z^.   *-A. snail bolshevik Force from Elenovka is reported to be attacking in tbe direotion of Erivan.POLAND.On February 1.9tb, V% Briand and Prince Sapieha sipned an   agreement, pledging prnnee and Poland to mutual assistance in case of an unprovoked attack and to joint aotion for tbe purpose of economic recovery.ITALY.There havo been serious disturbances in Florence, which have been drastically dealt with by tbe Italian Government, machine puns being employed.    Heavy casualties are reported, and tv/6 hundced arrests have been made.Serious riotd are also reported in Snezia and Leghorn. Railwaymen in all three places have struck&apos;, communication with the north is Interrupted.JUGO-SLAVIA.Arrangements are in hand for those of Denikin&apos;s refugees who are still at Constantinople, Egypt, and Cyprus, to be accommodated in Jug&apos;0-Slavia.Salonika will be their port of disembarkation.TURKEY.No settlement as regards the Turkish Treaty is as fret in sight.    The proposal of the London Conference for an Allied Commission of Enquiry for Smyrna and Thrace has been rejected by the Greek Government, but accepted by the Turkish Delegates, who, however, attach conditions to their acceptance which practically render this nugatory.ARMENIA.Wholesale massacres of Armenians have taken place at Kars and Alexandropol, about 85i of the population having been killed.PORTUGAL.A  new Ministry has been formed by Dr. Bemadino Machado, ex-Preisident of the Republic, which includes leading representatives of all political parties except Liberals and Socialists.UNITED   STATES.The British Charge  affaires at Washington, considers that the bill whioh was introduced into Congress on January loth proposing a gift, of ordnance and ammunition to Portugal represents nothing more than an act of courtesy on the part of the IT.S, in return for the permission granted to the latter country to use the islands as a naval base during the late war.
CENTRAL A^IOA.Panama Canal.In December&apos; 19^0 the State nepartnerrtY Y/ashington, ooramunioa-ted to tbe Panamanian Government a request that a portion, of an unnamed island in the region of Bahia de las I/inas, East of Colon, might be included in the Canal one as it was considered that its fortification was necessary to the protection of the Canal.The local U.S. Authorities in the meantime oocuyded the island without awaiting a reply from the Panamanian Government and notified the latter of the fact that the occupation had been   carried out.The Panamanian Government is naturally indignant at this high handed action on the part of the U.S. Authorities and an energetic protest has been forwarded to Washington.Panama and Costa Rica.On the ?,lst February a long standing boundary dispute between &quot;Panama and Costa Rica was renewed by the latter sending a small force into the Province of Chiriqui (Panama) and taking possession of it.The force was afterwards attacked by a superior number of Panamanian troops and compelled to surrender.The Costa Rioan Government maintain that under Uhe Anderson-Porras Treaty of 1910 and the White Award of 1914 the Province of Chiriqui is theirs and that they will denounce Panarva to the League of Nations for not carrying-out their treaty obligations.Washington has warned the Panamian Government that the only solution of the conflict is for her to return her forces behind the line fixed by the above Treaty.CHINA.The self-constituted Government in Canton is reported to he,ve ordered the Commissioners of Customs in Kuang Tung Province not to send to Shanghai a   surtax whioh the Peking Government has imposed in order to raise funds for famine relief in Northern China.   All questions of the disposal of Customs Revenuo must by Treaty be settler! by the Foreign Treaty Powers in co-operation with that Government of China which is reoognised by them.    The reported action is therefore a, defiance of the Treaty Powers.    The British Consul General has been authorised to take steps to prwent interference with the Customs administration, should need arise.    These steps, if rushed to their logical conclusion, involve a virtual blockade of the Canton Delta.i.....mi.....ii. im iinii unnwiiM Mil mini H. Hi IIHiUHBBIWlBBff?&quot;&apos;
