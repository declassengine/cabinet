Almost every industry is conoernod, but the most pressing cases are those of the miners, engineers, transport workers, seamen and bakers.   A reduction in these industries v/ould immediately lower the cost of living.   Mr. Cramp has stated openly that he would &quot;stop every wheel in the country&quot; before agreeing to a reduction in the basic rate, as distinct from the sliding scale. While most of the leaders realise that a reduction is inevitable, it would be unwise to count upon acceptance by the rank and file, at any rate   of the more powerful Unions.Unemployment is not decreasing and tho temper of the men is becoming bitter.   The Communists are taking full advantage of thiF.The Red International of Trade Unions and the iiihop Stewards movements, which aro working closely together, are making steady progress. There have boon several prosecutions during the week, with tho usual result of moderating incendiary speechoes.Incendiary fires continue in various parts of England. The evidence points to Sinn Fein. The arrest and internment of Sean McGrath has disconcerted the agitators, in this country.There is no improvement in the state of Ireland
THE COAL foreign    n   r-..       i i ii i - ll---1The Labour world is watching the miners with anxiety, regarding theirs as a test case for reductions in wages: unfortunately,, the issue is complicated by the question of de-control and national and district rates of wages,   Frank Hodges stated that tho 1&apos;iners&apos; Sxecutivo will suomit a wages and profit scheme direot to the Government without consulting further with tho employers but this plan has now been changed.Among the steadier men there is some difference of opinion. While they are practically unanimous against de-control, many colliers in Durham and Northumberland would rather revert to district rates than strike to enforce a national wage. Lancashire   and Cheshire, on the other hand, insist that the industry shall be treated as a national unit.   Though the temper of the men is not good, there is no desire to strike.In South Wales most of the miners strongly oppose de-control but a section favour the return to distriot rates because the rates will probably be higher than in some other coal fields.   On March 6th A. J. Cooke told the miners that unless t&amp;ey organised their forces for a fight they would have to acoept a reduction of practically 50 per cent; that the acceptance of the   owners1 conditions would commit them to co-partnership without giving them any control of the industry. Economy and expediency in administration would be ruthlessly enforced and 40,000 or 50,000 men would be summarily dismissed. He urged co-operation with the railway men, who are to be de-controlled at the end of April, and said that Trade Unionists &apos; would have to make a united stand against reduotion in wages. They were now, he said, in the last phase of the struggle between Capital and Labour.All this has consolidated the extremists, though they have not yet come out into the open.   They will never have sopromising/
promising an opportunity because they can now take their stand on wages, the one point that affects the rank and file, and on the failure of their constitutional leaders to bring \ the negotiations to a successful issue.The Yorkshire miners, with their unsupported strike of 1919 fresh in their memories, would not offer much opposition to district rates.   Many of their steady officials, however, are unpopular, and A. V. Williams, who is President of the    j Yorkshire Miners1 Unofficial Reform Committee and a member oil the Red International of Trade Unions, is preparing the ground] for en attack upon the constitutional leaders.   Re thinks that circumstances are playing into his hands and that the time is near when ho can raise the cry of &quot;Seize the mines&quot;.Alec Gosling, County Secretary of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Unofficial Committee, is issuing manifestoes frankly advocating Communism, &quot;which means ownership and control of the means of I life by the working class.&quot; Against individual ownership, he saySj Trade Unionism and Parliament are &quot;hopeless, powerless   I and helpless.&quot;   &quot;Away with the sectionalism of Trade. Unions.1 Away with the compromises negotiated by officials&apos;.   Away with the reforms of political twisters&apos;.   Let us secure the workers&apos; control of industry.   The workers cannot make a worse h&apos;tsh of it than the boss class.&quot;Inwthe Midlands, also, the -extremists are active but have no great hold.   Here the miners are still steady but they are very hostile to the Government, which is alleged to have &quot;tricked&quot; them in October last.   The Nottinghamshire extremists have&apos;attacked their financial secretary and their.&apos;treasurer so SUCCOci sfully that they have both resigned.   The former, Mr, J. C. Hancock, M.P., has published, a vigorous rejoinder to the demands for his resignation.   He accuses the extremists of trying/
trying to discredit and hound out of position by any means all the loyal and constitutional Trade Union leaders.   This, it may be remarked, is the policy of the Red International.Tom Dingley, who combines his work as a shop steward with the duty of organising the Red International of Trade Unions, has just completed a tour of the Welsh coal fields. The supporters of the unofficial movement in the Rhondda Valley are said to number 40,000.The rebel miners in Scotland are moving for the establishment in Scotland of a separate National Union.unemploymentThere is little change in the unemployment situation, but it must be recorded that with each week the temper of the workless becomes more despondent and bitter.     The communists are the only people who are deriving benefit from the situation and they hope that rising rates will create among the middle classes discontent which will be expressed in antagonism to the Government.In London the unemployables, especially at Camberwell and Chelsea, show signs of becoming disorderly: at Peckham on March 1st, a man named Goss was arrested for assaulting a policeman by striking him   in the mouth after a meeting of the Camberwell Municipal Association had been broken up by an organised gang. There appears to be a growing feeling against the Municipal authorities for which the ringleaders of the unemployables are largely responsible.Reports from the provinces indicate increasing distress: my Lancashire correspondent reports cases of families having literally no food and of ex-Service men pawning their medals. A meeting at Liverpool on March 1st was attended by 4,000 unemployed but the proceedings were orderly.
The first demonstration of unemployed which has occurred? in the Durham area was held at West Eartlepool on March 6th, when 1,500 people marched through the streets to the Town Half1Several of the speakers declared that the present situation1had been created by the employers to bring down wages.   A resolution demanding work or maintenance at a subsistence le was passed.Unemployment in the Birmingham district is acute but urn is being done to relievo distress by the wealthier citizens. Prom Coventry my correspondent reports that there is the &quot;greatest concern&quot; at the increasing unemployment: comparati few workers are now on full time and the small tradesmen complain that business is almost at a standstill.   The local Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee has formed a &quot;revolutionary band&quot;, consisting of 6 men, who clay the &quot;Red Flag&quot; and the &quot;International&quot; while the unemployed are drawing their relief money.   It is known as the &quot;Red Orchestra&quot; and practi in the Independent Labour Party rooms.In South Wales unemployment has reached grave proportioj but there has, as yet, been no disorder: a number of processf and demonstrations have&quot;been held in various towns and the genuine unemployed are said to be bitterly criticising the Government and the smallness of the unemployment grant.The Glasgow unemployables are still active under the leadership of John McLean.   It is stated on good authority \ McLean and his lieutenants have extracted for some time ove   7 a week, in addition to expenses, from the men for whom are supposed to be working.In.Dundee the revolutionary elements among the unemploy who number several hundreds, are abnormally active; &quot;Sandy&quot; frequently addresses meetings in this city, advocating revolution and urging tie workers to take food if it be ref them.   Revolutionary propaganda- has received great impetusunemployment/
unemployment snd. has made more progress during, this winter than ever before. TBE RED INTERNATIONAL OF&apos; TRADE UNIONS -On March 5th the Northern Section of the British Bureau of this movement held a conference at Newcastle: about 450 delegates represented, officially and unofficially, miners, engineers, railwaymen, wood workers, wire drawers, transport workers, pattern makers, joiners, women workers, trades councils and the Irish Self-Determination League.   As indicated in my report&apos;No. 94 special efforts were made to gain the support of the Irish element and an appropriate resolution, moved by Jackson, was passed.   Harry Pollitt moved a resolution advocating affiliation to the Red International of Trade Unions and another congratulating the Russian v/orkers uoon their achievements; both were passed.    Pollitt declared that the trade union organisation in this country was &quot;just a big black-legging organisation.&quot;   George Harvey, the North Eastern organiser, spoke in support of the resolutions and Robert Williams was then called upon to address the conference: he did so in terms which he usually reserves for oountries which are outside British jurisdiction, saying that he was prepared to support every revolutionary tendency he saw,&apos; and if he did not see a revolutionary tendency, to try and create one.   As one who knew the official trade union movement pretty well he said that if they welted for their officials there v/ould be nothing done.   The unfortunate thing about the trade&quot; union movement was that many of the constitutionalists, of the respectable trade union loaders, had really a vested interest in the capitalist exploitation of the working classes in the same way that the medical men had a vested interest in disease, and the police and&apos; magistrates had a vested interest in crime.He/
He had read the speeches of the Duke of Northumberland who had said that the time would come when the landowners would refuse to pay taxes.   &quot;I say of a certainty, within the lives of some of those in this room&apos;, the time will come when the Duke of Northumberland will be given no damned taxes to pay.1&apos;   The whole capitalistic system was destroying itself -it was,doomed - and he wanted the workers to be ready with a system to supersede it - with Collectivism or Socialism or Communism,   &quot;I want the revolution tc be conducted with the least sanguinary effects.&quot;   &quot;I don&apos;t want us to lose a million mon in the social revolution (A voice: &apos;It&apos;&apos;8 got to be dono&apos;) as wo lost them in the Imperial war, but it is more worthy, fighting for a cause which is yours.  -Much bettor give our lives fighting for tho proletarian cause,&quot; he concluded.Progress in organising the movement is being made in the Midlands, particularly by Brain, who is responsible for tho Birmingham district and is in addition chairman of the local shop stewards committee and a leader of the local Communist Party.   He has now a council on which engineers, ironfounders, railwayman, bakers&quot;, furnishing trades, clerks; general workers, and trades councils are represented, mostly in the persons of trade union officials. &apos;/&apos;P. Jackson has been active in Liverpool, Bolton and Barrow where committees have been formed and is going to Halifax and Leigh.The officials o&apos;f the Fife Miners&apos; Association.have decided not to send delegates to Moscow, but agreed to&apos; s-end the resolution to the Scottish National Union.&apos;  The rebel elements are nevertheless determined to send delegates.   The Glasgow Trades Couuci.1 is reported to have passed a resolution in support of affiliation to &quot;the Red International of Trade Unioijt Poulis has not, however, ret *with much success in Stirling and Alloa although he has formed committees at Dunfermline andCowdenbeath/   I
Cowdenbeath: he reports branches hbs. 1 and 2 of tho Amalgamated Engineering Union and Uos,4&amp;6 of the Workers Union in Rosyth as &quot;red&quot;.On March 9th the British Bureau met at the headquarters of the Communist Party of Greet Britain in Louden: the agenda coveredElection of Executive CommitteeElection of sub-Committee as requiredFinancial appealScheme of Associate MembershipQuestion of rep resentttion at Moscow Congress.Tomsfcy, the general secretary of the Provisional Councilcf the International, has announced that the Moscow Congresswill be held on July 1st Instead of on May 1st. *THE SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTYThis Party, which is probably the most important revolutionary body in Scotland, will hold its eighteenth annual conference in Dewsbury at Easter.   To judge from the agenda, it is modifying its general policy, with the apoarent view of bridging over the difficulties which have hitherto separated the Socialist Labour Party from the Communists.The object of the Party is the abolition of capitalismand the establishment of a &quot;Socialist Industrial Republic&quot;and the industrial policy is declared to be that of Industrial,as opposed to Craft, Unionism.   The political policy is to be modified in the direction of a kind of Dictatorship of theProletariat, defined as follows:&quot;To safeguard the interests of the revolutionary workers during the transitionary period of powor, the political function of the revolutionary workers shall be to co-ordinate all its forces to destroy the power of all reactionary forces.   This we accept as the dictatorial power of revolutionary Labour ...&quot;To propagate the above principles, tho Socialist Labour Party supports political action within the snhereof/
of Parliamentarism to forward the Social Revolutionary movement in direct opposition to all the Reformist Parties.&quot;Under tho heading &quot;Internationalism&quot;, the&quot;Executive moves that the Socialist Labour Party shall seek affiliation to the Third International as the highest express ssion oi Revolutionary Internationalism, and shall at all times vjork to characterise the International as the correct expression of its national revolutionary units.The Woolwich branch of the party advocates fusion with the Communist Party of Great Britain, but opposition is likel to be raised by Leicester  and other branches which consider that the policy of tho Industrial Workers of tho World approximates more closely to that of the Socialist Labour PaiTHE COjgmiSTSUnemployment is still the best recruiting agent for communism and is the main theme for revolutionary speakers. While it is doubtful if the actual membership of the Party makes much headway, considerable progress is being made underground:&apos; the Communist Party has a close working agroemen with the Red International of Trade Unions and with the Shop stewards  and Workers&apos; Committees, by means of which some of the important trade unions are being slowly undermined.Recent arrests have greatly perturbed communist orators who are much more guarded in their speech.   Efforts are being made to secure tho transfer of political prisoners, such as Mai one and Sylvia Pankhurst from the Second to the First Division: meetings are held each Sunday outside Eolloway Pris to cheer the latter, but the attendance is negligible.Tho London District Council of the Communist Party is,* -  the words of Cant, the organising secretary, &quot;in a state of bankruptcy&quot;, although a series of dances has been held in the hope, of raising funds.   The Walthamstow branch has expelled . four/
M 9 - &apos; tfour members for &quot;breach of discipline, via., failure to comply with request to resign from local Unemployment Committee v/hen it degenerated into a 1 Soup Kitchen1&quot;.On March 6th about 600 people attended a meeting held under tho auspices of the Cardiff branch of tho Communist Party. William Mellor, Industrial Editor of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and a member of tho Party Executive,made a violent attack upon the capitalist system and stated that Parliament at present was undoubtedly nothing more than the executive of the capitalists, controlled direct from Throgmorton Street.   He further stated-that the trade unions.as at present constituted were simply the &quot;lap-dogs&quot; of the capitalists and apoealed to his hearers to concentrate on the creation of a workers&apos; republic in this country.   Finally Mellor said that communists, Sinn Peiners and Bolsheviks were all of one class and were all working for one object, tho wholesale destruction of capitalism......Although the Bull Ring orators continue to hold meetings in Birmingham, they are now devoting more attention to adjoiningdistriots, where they think there is less chance of arrest.......The following extracts, taken froia a speech made by B. *T.Rowlands, secretary of the looal Plebs League and a member ofthe Communist Party, at Red Hill Schools, Yardley, on March6th, indicate the line taken by speakers who fear openly to advocate revolution:% wWe of the Communist Party must make it clear to other workers that we are Communist revolutionary workers and we want neither reformists, pacifists nor any other, wobblers.   We are out to boycott the ballot box. We are non-parliamentarians, we are out to break up the maohinery of the present Government and&apos; to replace it by a new one, oreated on a Communist basis.   When the revolution is accomplished it will be neoessary to , establish a dictatorship of the proletariat.   The fundamental feature of the dictatorship cf the proletariat will be the organisation of the state and a form of administration of state affairs which, in the transitional stage from capitalism to communism will allow the proletariat ruling class to crush all resistance on the part of the oxploiters of the work of oommunist reconstruction.
&quot;I am g revolutionary communist, and I am out to teach the workers the communist methods.   I want all yi workers to organise in your trade unions, under the Rei International Union and when you are all organised in large union we will then be rrepared to overthrow capitalism and bring about a state of communism,&quot;During the week-end wild speeches have been made by members of Guy Aldred&apos;s Glasgow Communist Group,   James MoDougall declared on Glasgow Green that the day would short come when the workers would seize and hold their own.   The continual imprisonment ofMalono, Pankhurst, Aldred and oth* by a dirty and b .... Government, at the behest of a traitoi gang of capitalists must be stopped.   If it is necessary to arm the workers, then that must be done, because the time wi be here in a few weeks.   They must get their comrades out of prison so that they carry on the work to a successful issueV/, Nicol of the same group informed his audience of 40 that it only required 100,000 communists to break up the British Empire.   If ever a crisis is reached in this country the Army and %vy would be with the communists because they were already thinking along the lines of communism.It is reported that the Scottish Workers1 Committee, which has started through the medium of &quot;The Worker&quot;, a &quot;Gallacher Fund&quot;, is paying Mrs, Gallacher  5 a week.   John McLean, who has recently h?;.d a bitter quarrel with Gallacher is organising a meeting for tho benefit of Gallache^s dependents,&apos; - ;     &quot;     &apos;      &apos;        , &apos;THE -INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY: AND THE THIRD INTERNATIONALThe Left Wing of the Independent Labour Party is activel preparing for the annual conference at Easter,   A manifesto has been issued whioh bears the signatures of seventeen &apos; 1 extremists, amongst whom are three officials of the British Bureau of the Red International of Trade Unions.   this document/
- u- &apos; 472document condemns the Second International in the usual terms, derides the latest efforts to form a now one in Vienna and urges all members to vote for the affiliation of the Independent Labour Party to the Third &quot;on which alone a vital end truly international organisation can be built.&quot;RENT INCREASESMy Glasgow correspondent reports that much indignation has been aroused by the announcement that landlords intend to increase rents by 10$ under the Act of last year.   Not only the extremists, but the steadier workers, who are very short of money, aro up in arms and the Housing Associations are assured of very substantial backing,THE POSTAL workers the annual conference of the Union of Post Office Workers will be held at Edinburgh on May 10th-13th.   About 600 resolutions appear on tho preliminary agenda, the majority of which obviously cannot be debated.   The strike polioy will be the crux of the conference and many contrary resolutions deal with this question: the so-called disruptionists, who are opposed to the Executive policy, have aroused bitter denunciation from the extremists.   A split in the union is not an impossible outooma of the conference.ARRESTSOn March 2nd Guy Aldred, Andrew Homing, Douglas McLeish and Janet Hamilton Patrick were arrested in connection with an article whioh appears in the &quot;Red Commune&quot;, Aldred1s new paper. On March 7th they appeared, in Glasgow for a declaration before the Sheriff and were committed for further enquiry, bail being refused.H, M. Emery, the revolutionary agitator, who has for somemonths/
raonths been organising the unemployed in Coventry, was arrested on Baron 3rd for a speech delivered recently in Birmingham.   He ai. 8 been remanded for seven days, bail being^ - allowed.% correspondent states tnat the &quot;greatest satisfaction&quot;is stressed by all classes in Coventry, with the exoeption o-the comparatively smell revolutionary group, at the arrest ol Snery.   This man has been preaching sedition in Coventry for nearly a year and the disturbed state of the looal unemployed! largely duo to his influence.   Emory has stated that he expected arrest when he went to Birmingham, although he used more moderate language than is his custom in Coventry.   He sincerely hopes that he will not be sent to orison as all hie propaganda work would have to be reoommenoed.   A solicitor ha been engaged and a Defence Kind is to be started; Euery says that it &quot;will cost a lot&quot; if he is to get off, so his supporters are asked to contribute generously.THE PRINCE OF WALES&apos; VISIT TO GLASGOWAs had been anticipated, a great effort was made by John McLean and the oHier revolutionaries to get together a disorde crowd of so-called unemployed to make a counter demonstration, The-Prince was received with great enthusiasm but a prooession of men and women, numbering about 2,000, carrying three large banners, some Red flags and a number of placards bearing inscriptions, collected in two of the. streets adjoining St.. Andrew&apos;s Hall.   While they waited the demonstrators hooted and booed persons in the crowd who disagreed with them, and sang the &quot;Red Flag&quot; and the &quot;International&quot;.   At intei^rals they blew on a bugle and shouted &quot;Up Dublin&quot;.   The departure of the Priaj from the hall was the signal for an organised outbreak of booing and for a moment it was feared that they might break throughthe/
IS -the Polioe &quot;barrier.   After the Prince had left, these demonstrators booed and hissed citizens whom they knew by sight.   John McLean was not seen,   The leaders were James Cox, of the International Union of Ex-Service Men, and Harry MoShane.   No violence was attempted, probably because the Police were in considerable force.SIM FSIN IH GREAT BRITAINThe incendiary activity of Sinn Feiners in this country is spreading, and although no very great damage has been done owing to the activity of the fire brigade the outlook is disquieting.   The method adopted is nearly always the same, namely, to saturate timber or other inflammatory material with paraffin or petrol by means of cotton waste.   The liquid is carried to the scene of the crime in tins or bottles.   In Newcastle, where a determined attempt was made on the premises ofGoodhall, Bates &amp; Co., Oil Refiners, one of the incendiaries was arrested.1 In Cheshire and in the London area the safer exploit of setting fire to hay ricks has been continued during the week. It is so very easy for a man on a bicycle late at night to set fire to a stack and escape before the fire is noticed that&apos;this form of crime is likely to grow.Information has been received that an outrage on a much larger soale is planned for March 17th.3?he arrest and internment of Sean mcgrath is bearing fruit in the smaller attendance noticed at the various Sinn Fein meetings.   Nearly all the leaders and speakers are wondering who is to be the next victim of the Government and they ere finding it diffioult to get volunteers to undertake dangerous duties.It &quot;is reported that under a new arrangement Scotland is to be divided into 14 divisions to facilitate the working of the sinn/
Sinn Fein organisation, whioh has apparently become too unwieldy to manage from a Central Office.   Eleven of these divisions are complete and in working order, and in a short time the reconstruction of the whole will have been finished.mi)he Sinn Fein Executive then intends to take steps for aggressive motion against property in Scotland in common with the activities of the Irish Republican Army in the North of England.It is rumoured that among McLean1s unemployed there are members of the Sinn Fein Army who are in possession of bombs and firearms.   This fact seems to be generally known among the unemployed and is often commented upon.IRELAND   &apos;&apos;-There is no change to report.   Outrage and murder have not decreased.   Flying columns of rebels are engaged in laying ambushes for troops and police and, unhappily, in manycases with success.In all there were 277 outrages committed during the week. Of these 236 were attributable to Sinn Fein, 5 were tho outcome of agrarian agitation and the remaining 36 were crimes of a serious nature, not attributable to Sinn Fein or agrarian motives Fifteen murders were committed and there were 37 attempts to murder.   There were 51 cases of highway robbery, and of these 49 were attributable, to Sinn Fein.   Numerous cases of&apos;intimidatio were reported.   Three police barracks were attacked and there were, 24 cas*es of injury to Post Office property.&apos;:; The Sinn Fein papers ^appeared as usual.   These papers continue to. do a^ vast ;amount of harm by their propaganda work. &quot;Old Ireland&quot; contains an obituary notice in mourning type of the Irish Republican Army prisoners who were executed1In Cork Gaol.   It is headed &quot;Unarmed Prisoners shot in&quot;cold blood&quot; and in the comments on the executions it asks,&quot;What &apos;is going to , ; , * :   -     &quot;&apos;&quot; happen/HI
happen Now?&quot; and answers the question by stating, &quot;\1q are grestly mistaken if the English in Ireland do not get the surprise of their lives as a result of these murders.   That is what people call them,   vv&apos;e cannot even calculate what the consequences will be.   But they will be enormous.   These last shootings ... will make grenadiers out of the most amazing ueople ... Wo have the feeling of anyone who has seen a fuse lit and is waiting till it reaches the explosive.   But, perhaps that is what the English invader wants ... The whole business will be speeded up now.   That is well.&quot;&quot;Young Ireland&quot; continues to devote much of its space to the encouragement of the 3Glfast boycott.   It has a leading article on the question of emigration from Ireland which points out the fallacy that work can be found in America, and says that those who are leaving Ireland are not emigrants but &quot;white-flaggers.&quot;There is very good reason for believing that leaders of Sinn Fein want a truce. They would like to save their faces by manoeuvring the Government into being the first to proclaim a truce. It is quite evident that few, if any, of them want a Republic Though nothing may come of such negotiations as are on foot at the moment, the fact that they are tired of guerilla warfere brings a settlement of some kind nearer.
