HIS DOCTJMWT-IS TOT. PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT),..]RET&apos;*dABIOT.P. 2605,KflDED FEBRUARY 14th1921,(Ciroulateo by the Chief Secretary for Ireland).I submit for the consideratitn of the Cabinet ray survey for the week ended the 14th instant..QE5JRALt STATE OF JTHE t.COIJNp% * Statistics cf Outrages^The Return cf Outrages for the week ended the 12th instant affords ground for satisfaction in the greatly reduced number of casualties in the Crown Forces, compared with the abnormally high figures for the three weeks immediately.preceding, but this improvement although welcome in itself is unfortunately not due to any marked slackening.of effort on the part of the enemies of the public peaces     The total number of ermed attacks upon parties or individual members of the Police and Military forces was twenty-six, a reduction of only three below the total for the previous week*     It Is obvious that the rebels have determined upon a policy of fierce, resistance, to the sterner measures for ihe suppression of disorder which have followed upon the introduction of Martial Law, and that in taking this course they.have adopted the only alternative open to them except a policy of Immediate; surrendero     Itt however, as I believe to be the case, their present display of activity represents the maximum.cf which they, are capable, the steady draining of their resources, by the arrests of their members and the assure of their material, which&apos;is going on day by. day; should result in a sensible improvement in the situation at a net distant date*
The meet striking incident of the week, which must,. unfortunately, be accounted as a rebel success, was an attack upon a party of Military, fourteen in number, who were proceeding by train from Mallow tc Killarney on the 11th instant. On leaving Mallow Station about 6a50 p.nu the engine cab was boarded by two men who compelled the driver and fireman at the point of the revolver to stop the train in a cutting about    -lj miles east of Millstreet Station, and fire was. immediately directed from both sides of the cutting upon the leading coach which contained the whole of the military passengers-. After a brief exchange of fire resulting in the death of a sergeant and the wounding of an officer and five other ranks, the military were compelled to surrender their arms and equipment to their assailants and the train was. thereupon allowed to proceeds     In view of the danger of this outrage being followed by others of a similar nature, the Commander-in-Chief has issued an announcement to the Press that in the event of another attack upon a troop train in the Martial Law area the railway on which the occurrence takes place will at once be closed down.Three attacks upon occupied police barracks took place during the week and in one case (Loughguile, Ballymohey District, Co-. Antrim) resulted in the destruction of the barrack.,,. but the garrison succeeded- in effecting their escape without iosSo   In the two other cases, (filphin, Strokes town District, 00*.. Roscommon which was attacked on the 11th instant, and Drimoleague Bantry District, Coc-Cork, attacked on the 19 th instant)-t-- the barracks were partly destroyed by. explosives. but the raiders-were eventually driven off n     The enly casualty sustained-by.;-the Police in the encounters, was cue case. o,f! wounding (at -Drimo league&apos;)- a fact which bears&quot; witness to the improved efficiency of the arrangements now made for the defence of -&apos;-
police barracks.   The two mortal police casualties suffered during ths week were that of a Special Constable who was killed in an ambush at r&apos;arrenpoint, Howry District, Co,, Down on the 6th instant, and that of a Constable of th* Royal Irish Constabulary who was assassinated in Churchtown, Charloville District,, Go * Cork on the 19th instant.Minor casualties for the week comprised 10 raids upon mails, 5 raids for arms and 14 raids upon the offices of rate collectors in which sums of money amounting to a total of  5,943. 2. 0 were seized.Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 121* The most important arrest was that of Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald, MoP, the very able chief of tho Publicity and Propaganda side of the Sinn Fein organisation,Trie Is of Civilians by Court Martial,Fifty-two trials of civilians by Court Partial tookplace during the week and resulted in thirty-eight convictionsand fourteen acquittals.     The following is an, analysis of the sentences imposed4       Sentences of penal servitude (5 years each)14       Sentences Of Imprisonment withhard labour        (3 months to 2 years)..9       Sentences of Imprisonment withouthard labour.

POLITICAL OPTION &apos;pH IRELAND.So far as Southern Ireland is concerned there have beenfew manifestations of ordinary political activity during theParliamentary recess, and it is obvious that while the existing conditions continue the organised political life of the country must remain at a standstill.     None of the various partiesopposed to Sinn Fein would appear to have much confidence intheir ability to turn the present situation to the advantageof their own respective policies, and the attitude of each has ofbeen one/waiting upon the development of events *     Neither of the two Home Rule parties - The Irish Parlimentary Party and the Irish Dominion League - has yet issued any official pronouncement of policy in regard to the working of the Government of Ireland Act, but the policy of the former may, perhaps, be gathered from the speeches delivered by Mr, Devlin, Captain Redmond, and other members of the Party at a Belfast demonstration held on the 15th instant,     Mr. Devlin appears to have been intentionally obscure in his endeavour to avoid committing himself too definitely to the course of working the Act in Northern Ireland, but the whole sense of his speech suggested that the Nationalist will endeavour to promote the eventual reunion of Ireland by asserting their political strength to the full in the six counties area.    Captain Redmond&apos;s declaration wa3 one of explicit and unqualified refusal to accept the Act for Southern Ireland,     The attitude to be taken up by the Irish Dominion League was the subject of a private
conference held at the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin, on the lQth - instant which was followed by a guarded Press annmanoement : to- the effect that the general sense of the meeting was against working the Southern Parliament, under protest or otherwise, but that it was considered to be premature to record any final opinion until the situation had been more clearly defined.    A resolution iras passed at the Conference urging that &quot;in the interests of peace the Government should take the first step by making a firm offer of a settlement, with a preliminary-truce accompanying it by a pledge, on peace ensuing, to grant an amnesty and to make provision by way.of reparations for Indemnifying private owners and the ratepayers at large from the losses inflioted upon them during the recent and present troubles by Government or insurrectionary forces.&quot;The real reason why anti-Sirm,Fein party leaders and others do not come out into the open is their fear of the Sinn Fein gunmen..
