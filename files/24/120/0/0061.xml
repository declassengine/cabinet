(P. 1250) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 26011st March 1921.(Received 2nd, 8 ami.)Priority A.295 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Dobbs, 56 (J., 28th February :  &quot; I attended AnnYs Accession Durbar with members of Mission yesterday evening. S. very ill, apparently consumptive, and unable to attend, but rest of his &quot;party there. I was in chair in front of front rank, exactly opposite Amir.   Ministers on Ainir&apos;s right, his blood relations on left, Inayatulla fourth among these, Jamal second among Ministers immediately below Nadir Khan, while Tarsi (? was given) third place. Before Durbar we were introduced in anteroom to Russian Mission, of whom only one, Colonel Rix, speaks Persian.   After long flattering address read by Home Minister, Amir delivered harangue setting forth his devotion to country.   Tarsi then, standing by me, said he was charged by representatives of two Powers present, names not mentioned, to congratulate Amir.   Latter replied that lie was pleased to receive congratulations of neighbouring friendly Powers and anxious to live at peace and harmony with them on one condition, which he left to be inferred, that they respect completely Afghan independence.   Durbar then broke oil&apos;, and we walked some 300 yards to Dilkhusha, Amir talking to me politely.   Unceremonious reception followed, chess and cards, democratic note prominent, and chief feature patriotic songs by pupils of Military School and orphans of soldiers killed in war against us.   Marked contrast between demeanour of Sardars towards (&apos;? British and Russians), latter sitting apart almost unnoticed, while British mixed freely with Afghans and received many hints of friendly feeling.   Reisner&apos;(? of) (corrupt group) told me that Rosenberg was with Litvineoff in London.   Particulars would be useful.&quot;
