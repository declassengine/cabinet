This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government!SECRET. ,vCP. 2607.THE CABINET.THE PROPOSED KINGDOM OF MESOPOTAMIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.T circulate herewith a memorandum prepared by the General Staff on the proposal to make the Emir Feisal the first King of Mesopotamia.L. W.-E.The War, Ofj-iob,liUh February, 1921.1. In considering the proposal to make the Emir Feisal the first King of Mesopo-tamia, it is convenient to enunciate the pros and cons under the following four headings : (A.) The causes of Franc Vs objection to Feisal. (B.   The local objections to Feisal. (0.) The advantages in the selection of Feisal. (D.) Summary and conclusion.2. The causes of Frances objection to Feisal: (a,) Ever since the terms of the Sybes-Picot agreement had become known, Feisal and the French have been more or less continuously at loggerheads. The primary cause of these differences is that the Sykes-Picot agreement clashes with the spirit of the correspondence conducted between Hussein and MacMahon. In the latter, Hussein was led to believe that, should the Allies win the war, they would be willing to agree to the institution of an Independent Arabia, bounded on the west by a line, leaving the districts of Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus to the Arabs, and thence to the lied Sea, the Indian Ocean to the south, excluding Aden, the Persian Gulf and the Persian boundary to the east, and latitude 370 to the north (see red line on attached map), with certain reservations as regards Mesopotamia. At the time it was pointed out that France had interests in the coastahregion of Syria from Mersina to Beirut, extending inland to points west of Aleppo, Honis, llama and Damascus.* This area was therefore excluded from discussion. With this &quot;reservation, and in such areas as His Majesty&apos;s Government were justifiee to act without detriment to their ally France, King Hussein&apos;s proposals were in main agreed to.The terms of the Sykes Picot agreement between England and France (of which Hussein was at the time ignorant), however, placed the whole of the Northern area of Hussein&apos;s Independent Arabia under foreign influence, and this was sub-divided into : (i.) The French coastal region marked blue on map. (ii.) Area &quot; A&quot; where France had priority of interest.   ($eemap.) (hi.) Area &quot;B&quot; where His Majesty&apos;s Government had priority of interest. (See map). Southern boundary, i.e., dotted line, was never definitely fixed.According to this agreement an independent Arab State was to be set up throughout Arabia, the French having priority of appointing advisers in Area &quot; A &quot; and British in &quot; B,&quot; if asked for by the Arabs, but difficulties arose as regards the boundary between the French Area (Blue) and Area &quot; A,&apos;&quot;&apos; which culminated in the French ejecting Feisal from Damascus (which is in Area &quot;A&quot;) by force of arms.* See dotted red Hue on map.

The foregoing is a brief precis of the events which L d up to FeisaVs fall and since he still wields considerable influence over the tribes bordering the French sphere, it is not surprising that he is considered by the French as a potential enemy.(6.) General Gouraud, whose views command widespread support throughout France, is frankly alarmed at the possibility of Feisal being utilized by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Mesopotamia. General Gouraud was convinced of the essential falseness of FeisaFs character, quoting in support of which t! e alleged remark of Keisal to him that he, Feisal, was quite willing to combine with Gournud in turning out the English.(c.) In view of the above, it is possible that the anti-French party in Syria might construe Feisal&apos;s nomination into a split between England and France, and so be encouraged to further activities.It is conceivable that the French objections to Feisal becoming King of Mesopotamia might be overcome bv his giving a guarantee to do his best to quieten the tribes on the French border.-, ai d this is undoubtedly a line of argument which His Majesty&apos;s Government might well put forward. It is also obvious that a contented Feisal as King of Mesopotamia would probably be far less dangerous to the French than a disgruntled Feisal stirring up trouble throughout Arabia.3. The local objections to Feisal. The local objections to Feisal are chiefly confined to the effect his accession would have on the remaining independent States of Arabia, viz. : Nejd, Asir, Yemen, Shannnar.(a.) Nejd. lbn Saud, Sultan of Nejd, is by far the most important ruler of the above States. The boundaries between the Hedjaz and Nejd have been the cause of dispute between Hussein and Ibn Saud for a long time. During the slimmer of 191!) the Akwan of lbn Saud came very near capturing Mecca, and it was only after very strong protests by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-nient that they ceased to advance. But there is no doubt that, had he so desired, Ibn Saud could have taken Mecca and overrun the Hedjaz.Since then His Majesty&apos;s Government have made several attempts to settle the boundary question of Khurma and Taraba, and bring about a reconciliation, but so far with no success.Therefore, although at present the efforts made to prevent Ibn Saud from laying his hands on Mecca and the Holy Cities have been successful, it seems probable that he is only waiting, I ecause he hopes to obtain some greater advantage from His Majesty&apos;s Government as soon as the Arabian policy is finally settled. At the moment he is in receipt of a subsidy, but this subsidy is not large enough to compensate for the advantages which he-can take for himself.In view of the above it is not likely that Ibn Saud will regard with equanimity the appointment of Feisal, hussiens son, as King of Mesopotamia, especially as he would then have Hussein on his western frontier and Feisal on his north-eastern frontier. Ibn Sand is still capable of overrunning the Hedjaz, and the possibility of his so doing cannot be overlooked, should he learn thai the son of his rival has been proclaimed King of Mesopotamia. He has said openly that &quot; if the English leave Irak he regards it as fair game.&quot;(b) Asir. The Idrisi of. Asir is inimical to Hussein, the t: bone of contention&quot; beiiuf the port of Kunfida, which both desire ; his ideas on Feisal as King of Mesopotamia would probably coincide with those of Ibn Saud, of whom he is an ally.The Idrisi is, therefore, unlikely to view with favour anything which would increase the power of Hussein and would probably side with Ibri Saud in any attack which the latter might make on Hussein.At the present moment he is conducting a campaign near Bajil against the Imarn of Yemen.(c.) Yemen. The Imam ! Yemen is now showing a tendency to negotiate with Hussein to form an rtnee against the Idrisi, and it is possible that in the event of Ibn Saud atta:.; tig Hussein the Imam might be able to neutralize the Idrisi, but even this is doubtful at present.
(d.) Shammar. As regards the Shammar, Hussein has been in active conimuni-cation with Ibn Eashid of the Shammar, who is the hereditary enemy of &apos; Ibn Saud, with a view to forming an alliance against the latter.Although success has not altogether attended hussiens efforts, Ibn Saud has shown by his nervousness with regard to the recent activities of Abdullah at Maan, that he fears a combination of Hussein and Ibn Kashid.In short, if Feisal is proclaimed King of Mesopotamia, there is great possibility of a conflagration flaring up throughout the Arabian Peninsular, the intensity of which is dependent on the view that Ibn Saud takes of the appointment. This would apply equally if Abdullah, or any other son of King Hussein were appointed.4. The advantages in the selection of Feisal. (a.) The good name of the British Empire. His Majesty&apos;s Government made various agreements with the Fledjaz at the beginning and during the war, these agreements have been kepi only very partially, if at all.Hussein and his sons did their best to help during the war, and were loyal throughout ; but there is no doubt that they consider that the pledges given have not been fulfilled, and that they have been thrown overboard now that they can be of&apos; no further assistance.The selection of Feisal would probably entirely destroy this impression. The influence which His Majesty&apos;s Government has over the Mahomedan world in general is greatly maintained hy its reputation of fair dealing, and of keeping its pledged word. The appointment of Feisal to Irak would greatly enhance that good name.(b.) Religion. From a religious point of view Feisal should be acceptable to the inhabitants of Mesopotamia although he is a Sunni.The majority of Irak are Shiaiis. The last of the true descendants of the Prophet disappeared in 878 while still a boy. The Shiahs believe that he will reappear in time and establish the Universal Khaliphate.Feisafs family belonged to the Quraish tribe which was the Prophets own tribe, and Feisals family are the most prominent members of this tribe.Feisal would apparently be accepted as a descendant of the Prophet by the Shiahs, and as such would be acceptable to them.(c.) Relations with the British. Although Feisal may have &quot;been disappointed in his expectations from His Majesty&apos;s Government yet he still has more faith in Great Britain than in any other power. He has also a good deal of experience of British methods of Administration, and could rule Mesopotamia in conjunction with His Majesty&apos;s Government far better than most Arabs. He &quot;gets on&quot; with Englishmen and dealings with him would therefore be easier than with another.[d.) Hostility to Bolshevism. It is believed that Feisal detests Communism and Bolshevism.   The countries bordering on Mesopotamia are gradually being .  seduced by Bolshevism.   If Feisal were made King of Irak and a settled government introduced there, that country might become an example to its Mahomedan neighbours, and a potential barrier against Bolshevism.e.) Hussein and Mustapha Kemal. There is no doubt that Feisafs brother, Abdullah, is in constant communication with, if not under the direction of, Mustapha Kemal. To what extent Hussein is implicated is uncertain, but * the appointment of Feisal would doubtless influence Hussein in desisting from intrigues in this direction, and this could be made a further argument to persuade the French to relinquish their objection.(f.) Steadying effect on Middle East. There is no doubt that Ibn Saud and the Idrisi feel that the British, having got all they could out of Hussein and his family during the war, are now leaving them in the lurch. FeisaTs appoint-ment would alter this, and it is fair to hope that the neighbouring Arab chiefs would easily be brought to believe, that they would receive their reward in due course, if they did what His Majesty&apos;s Government asked them. It should then appear to them that their best policy would be to acquiesce in the accession of Feisal to the throne of Irak.
5. Conclusion. To recapitulate.     The arguments against Feisal as King of Mesopotamia are : (i.) French objection that he is hostile to France. This might be overcome by guarantees given by Feisal to the French and assurances of goodwill from -His Majesty&apos;s Government. : (ii.) Objections of Ibn Saud and the Idrisi. The situation appears to be that whether Feisal is nominated to Irak or not, there will be trouble in Arabia, but it is open to question whether his appointment would not have a quietening effect on the above, in the hopes that they may obtain some further reward.The advantages are : (i) Enhancement of the good name of Great Britain.(ii.) Religious acceptability both to Shiahs and Sunnis as a descendant of the Prophet.(hi.) Accustomed to British methods of administration, (iv.) Hostility to Bolshevism.(v.) Probable cessation of EIussein&apos;s intrigue with Mustapha Kemal and a general improvement in British relations with Hussein, which will react favourably on the Pilgrimage. . , (vi.) Steadying effect on the Middle East., . In conclusion, although the disadvantages of Feisafs appointment to Irak are grave, the chief of them being the objection of the French, yet it is the opinion of the General Staff that the advantages distinctly outweigh the disadvantages; and that the accession of Feisal as King of Mesopotamia would produce beneficial results.
