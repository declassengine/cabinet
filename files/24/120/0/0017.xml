GENERAL.There is as yet no evidence that the increase in unemployment has been arrested. The most serious decline in industrial activity during the past week is in the iron and steel industries. This has in turn adversely affected iron stone mining. Decreased activity is also reported in the coal-mining industry, and a considerable amount of under-employment is reported from certain of the Welsh mining areas. The continued fall in the price of cotton is adversely affecting the lace trade, and, until prices become more stable, no improvement can be expected. The outlook in the boot and shoe trade continues to improve, and employers are now anticipating a return to normal conditions by the summer. No change is reported in connection with the cotton or woollen industries, and conflicting opinions are held as to the prospects of an early revival. Large numbers of men are still being paid off from the shipbuilding yards.II. EMERGENCY WORK.The Prime Minister made a statement in the House of. Commons on the 19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. He outlined schemes for employing a large number of fit ex-Service men in connection with the Housing Programme, on which negotiations with the trade unions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme for Arterial Roads in London and in the provinces; whilst at the same time pressing forward with the Ministry of Transports programme of road classification and maintenance grants.A further statement was made by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December, indicating that the further proposals of the Government included: a final endeavour to secure an agreement with the building trades for the admission of ex-Service men; a rapid extension of road construction schemes; the distribution by the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Yiscount St. Davids, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting local authorities on relief schemes other than house building and road work; and the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit. It has since been agreed that the Unemployment Grants Committee shall also deal with schemes in respect of road work other than those undertaken by the Ministry of Transport.ROAD WORK PROGRAMME.
