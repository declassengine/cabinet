Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.The course of business in the House of Commons since Parliament met has shown clearly that strong pressure may be expected in support of the payment of compensation from the Exchequer in the case of destruction of property in Ireland attribute&apos;&apos; to the action of members of the Grown Forces.I invite attention to the annexed memo: by Sir John Anderson on this and cognate Questions and would ask that the whole matter may be considered by the Cabinet at an early date,,I suggest also the propriety of establishing by legislation special machinery for the review of awards made by the County Courts in the case of uncontested claims.   There is abundant evidence to show that the damages awarded in many of these cases are grossly Inflated and are far in excess of the true value of the property destroyed or damaged*   Prom whatever source the compensation due is ultimately provided, it is i essential that provision should, be made for a fair and reasonable assessment of the damage0   The establishment of a special tribunal to which reference may be made at the instance either of the local authority or a substantial ratepayer or the Crown would meet the case*(Intd).

ETSCLOSTBE fa     CP.2637,MEMORANDUM BY SIR JOHN AHDSRSON.I draw your attention to the attached memo5 by Sir Henry Robinson, Vice President of the Irish Looal Government Board,, on the question of compensation for malicious damage or injury to person and property InIreland,,Tho subject calls for immediate decision for several reasons?&quot;(1) It Is certain that severe pressure will be put upon the Government as soon as Parliament meets to guarantee compensation in general tezws in all cases where there is prima facie evidence that damage was due to the action or le^o^wn Forces *(2) The loyal Local Authorities in particular, such as Londonderry will press for Government assistfmoe in meeting the very heavy burden which the Malicious injury-ies Acts at present impose on their ratepayers owing to the present state of disorder in Ireland, for which, they will allege, it is unfair to hold them responsible, in as much as the disorder is no longer local, but national,(3) The Government are under pledge to see that the sums awarded by the Court on account of the death or injury of servants of the Crown, are duly paid to them-selves or their representatives.   Hitherto such payment has been made by deduction from grants due from public funds to the responsible local authority,      provided in the Malicious Injury Act, 1919, etc.   But in the case of some local authorities such grants are already exhausted; and the Government is obliged to seek funds from other sources in order to carry out its pledge.In considering this question I would urge that it is essential to maintain 2 principlesi-(1)   It is impossible in practice, and indefensible in policy as well as equity, to distinguish claims according to the authorship of the damage, and in particu-lar to make any sort of admission that damage due, or alleged to be due, to the action of servants of the Crown shall receive preferential treatment.Apart from the political objection to any such admission of Crown responsibility, the res\xlt would Un-questionably be to give a direct personal incentive to every person concerned to prove responsibility by the Crown Forces on the Government, and at the same time to mag-nify the real extent of such damage to an inordinate degree.In this connection i would Invite your special attention to the remarks of Sir H. Robinson - an officer with very great experience of Irish politics and a thorough knowledge of Irish psyciiology - (See p.p, 3 ft 4 of his memo).
(2) Both on political and economic grounds, thisis not thOptimo for a final payments    That should be reserved, if necessary, to form part of a final settle-went with the Irish nation, by a generous cancellation of dobto    All that is required at present Is a measure to relieve immediate necessities, both of public bodies and of Individual sufferers;   and the best way to do this is by way of repayable loans, not of ex gratia compensation, which would merely add to our financial difficulties without bringing us any hearer to a politi-cal settlement *Prom a Treasury point of view, it would be desirable that such loans should be advanced In a way that would enable us to recover our principal, after the appointed day, by deduction from the Irish share of reserved taxes.    This could only be done apparently, by making the proposed advances from a &quot;public&quot; fund, similar to the local loans fund, the development fund, or the road improvement fund, under s.27 (1) of the Government of Ireland Act.    1 have considered whether, in order to avoid controversial legislation, such a fund could be set up by means Of a simple Vote, but I am advised that this would be impossible.Accordingly, I submit that the Government should consider and choose between the two following alternativesA*    A short Bill, creating a fund within the meaning of a.27 of the Government of Ireland Act, out of whioh advances cou!4 be made by the Irish Government, with the consent of the Treasury, either (a) to local authorities, or (b) to individuals, provision being madn for the State to take over the individual^ right of recovery from the Local Authority and to collect the debt by deduc-tion from State grants, etc., as under the Criminal Injuries Act, 1920.Such advances would only be made subject to(i) proof of the Innocence of the applicant;(ii) proof of the immediate necessity of an advance;(iii) restriction to such amount, not exceeding the Award of the Court, as the pepartments consider necessary to meet immediate requirements.Such a Bill would, of course, expose the Govern-ment to a general attack on their whole policy in Ireland. It would, however, enable them to state clearly and firmly their views on the subject of compensation, and to indicate under what conditions of good behaviour and acceptance of the policy of the Home Rule Act they would be prepared hereafter to mitigate the burden on the Irish ratepaper. Such a pronouncement of Government policy might prove very useful on the eve of the elections for the Parliament of Southern Ireland.B. In default of such a Bill, it would seem that we cannot rely.on recovery, after the appointed day, of any debt due by Irish local authorities or individuals,and
and any such indebtedness should accordingly be restricted as far as possible.I submit therefore that, in this event, we should confine oursolvos to dealing with immediate necessitios by 2 remedial measures:-(a) A Vote, furnishing funds out of whioh advances would bo made subjoot to conditions fi) (ii) and fiii) of proposal A above, primarily to meet the claims of Grown servants or their representatives to y/hom Government is already pledged to secure the payment of the Awards of Court.    In return Government would roimburse themselvos by deduction under tho Malicious Injuries Act, 1919, from grants duo to tho local Authority;   but suoh deduction oould only bo enforced during tho intorval bofore s. 21 (2) oftho Government of Ireland Aot comes into foroe;   and owing to the inadequacy of deduotiblo funds in the case of oortain looal authorities a considerable amount of flobt may still bo outstanding on tho appointed day.(b) A short one-ciauso Bill authorising the Commissioners of Public Works, Ireland\ to lend from the Local Loans Fund to looal authorities who desire, with the approval of the Local Government Board to borrow for the purpose of meeting,their liability-ities undor the Criminal Injuries Acts, (Of. 6.5(2) of the Act of 1920)- provided that such local authorities have submitter to the regulations and audit of the Local Government Board.I am advise^ that this authority could not bo given under existing statutes, but it is hoped that the title of the Bill, may be worded in such form as to rule out of order any general discussion on tho Government&apos;s Irish policy on the broadcasting^ question of compensation,Ho exact estimate can be given of the liability to the State under either of thoso proposals, but a very rough guess would suggest that tho gross provision should be:-A. On a basis of 20$ of all existing claims,   1,350,000B. (a)      -      -      -  250,000,   in addition to the sums payable undor the M. X. Acts.from the point of view of tho Treasury A. is greatly to bo preferred to B., as the latter would involve payments from a fund (the Local Loans Fund) which has hitherto been kept outside the arena of political controversy.(3fl.)

BM010SUR3 gO   SIR JOHN AKDBRSQITS MEMORAJKPUM.Sir John Anderson,The preparation of the Sstimates for the rates for the new financial year has brought into strong focus the api^Jting burden thrown upon the ratepayers oi* Ireland in respect of the compensation payable for injury to persons a:id property, arising out of the attempt of Sinn Pain to over-throw His Majesty&apos;s Government in Ireland.So far as it is possible to judge from inquiries me.de. the claims will roughly amount to six millions.    The burden falls vory unevenly;   in some districts, a small addition to the rats is involved, while in others it amounts from  15 to  SO to ths  . of rateable value.The question of how this money is tc to found is ono which will vitally affect the trade and industry of the country and the prospects of a successful administration of tho Homo Rule Aot.In the event of the Government feoling impelled to help tho Gountry to meet this liability, it is presumed that its assistance will only be given in negotiation with the eleoted Parliaments&quot; for Northern and Southern Ireland.    If the people of Southern Ireland fail to elect a working Parliament, which would be in an authoritative position to negotiate over1 these olaims, they must only bo left to stew in thoir own juico, and must bear the wholo responsibility for the breakdown of any public services which may follow.    But in any appears the appeal from northern Ireland for relief from these charges is now being mado by tho County Councils, and must bo answered one way or another, and if the Government could see thoir way to make some announcement prior to the Elections, intimating that the representations of the new Parliaments on this subject would be amongst the first matters to bo considered after the elections, it would, I;think, be a   &apos; powerful influence towards the candidature of business men who would come forward with a programme for rehabilitating the finanoial position of the country.It could, of course, he argued that, in strict equity, Ireland has no claim to relief from the Imperial Exchequer in respect of this debt, and that the Republican Army and the people who have supported it and have done nothing to hinder its ravages are morally responsible for the wholo of the damage done by the Government Forces as well as by Members of Sinn Fein.    It is, I believe, impossible to point to a single premeditated act of destruction by the Crown Forces whioh was not the outcome of some ghastly murder or outrage by the Irish Republican Army
Jtayv   Nevertheless, a strong case for an Imperial contribution towards reconstruction, and one which it might be impolitic to repudiate, can be made out on these grounds(a) (The Government have created, an exact precedent by having admitted their liability for thodestruction of Dublin during the Robellion8   On this occasion, they gave large grants towards the cost of rebuilding houses which were destroyed whilst harbouring armed rebels, and they also lent the money to make up the balance of the cost of rebuilding..(b) It has been acknowledged, by the Government that in a few cases, suoh as Balbriggan and Cork, the Government Forces, maddened by the murder of their comrades, got cut of hand, and the property of loyal subjeots, who had no sympathy with Sinn Fein was destroyed in the confusion and excitement of tho reprisals,,(c) If. the countrys at the nest Election, shews a desire to disassociate itself from the forces of anarchy and to make a new start with a programme of peace, reconciliation and development, it will undoubtedly be to the Government*s own interest to launch the Parliament luihampered by a millstoneof debt which, in some areas, could not bs wiped out for generations, as the law now stands^(d) The continued existence Of this burden would bea constant source of strife and bargaining between the Irish Members and the Imperial Parliament, and. in the case of a Government with a small majority dependent upon the Irish Vote, the decision might be less equitable to all parties concerned than one which would be acceptable at the present time,This, briefly, is the case for assistance, and if it should be conceded9 there is one essential condition upon which the Government should be inexorable, name3.y, that there should be no attempt to determine the amount of the relief to be given, upon tho basis of the proportion of destruction wrought by the Forces of the Crown or by the &apos; Republican army   Although, taking the country as a ?/hole9 the reprisals probably represent an inconsiderable proportion of the total damage to life and property, it would be quite impossible to get evidence locally in support of this con-tention,   Shore is no one in the country, high or low, rich or poor, who would not have a direct personal interest in proving that the Government and the Forces of the Crown were responsible for the destruction,Irish witnesses have convenient memories, and great imaginative powers, when the issue at stake is One which affects their own pockets, and the bewildering evidence which could, be produced in the case of those claims would
would mislead any tribunal.   It is very doubtful if it would be possible to pet a tribunal of either Irishmen or Englishmen who would be regarded as absolutely impartial upon this question of apportioning the respon-sibility for the precise amount of damage done between the rebels and the Forces of the Crown,The proper course would seem to be to fix the proportion of any contribution on which the Government may give entirely upon the basis of existing indebtedness, current rates, and the rateable capacity of&quot;the district, and to refuso absolutely to go into the question of the responsibility for the damage in individual cases, on the grounds that the damage in every instance was either done by the Irish Republican Army or provoked by their assassins^ tions, and that any attempt at discrimination would be useless and would only give rise to a recrudesoenoe of anger and its consequences.   A flat rate or any form of fixed proportion of the loss incurred would be inexpedient, as a proportionate grant whioh would put the ratepayers of, say, County Kliaare, on their feet, would be of little or no help in oases suoh as Cork or Iiisburn.Further inquiry would be neoessary in the case of claims which have been unopposed by the looal authority, as the Awards in suoh oases were out of all proportion to the value of the damage done.It is a matter for consideration whether the Parliaments of Northern and Southern Ireland might not be authorised to iss\ie stock, guaranteed by the Imperial Parliament, and repayable say in 50 years, to pay off the revised awards, and to oharge the repayment equally on the valuation of the whole uistridtj or by graduated soale, as they thought fit.(3d) H.A.R0BIH301Sf..al Government Board, Ireland. 5th February, 1921,
