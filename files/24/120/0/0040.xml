C a B I N L TiTHE OJ? INDUSTRIES BILL.Memorandum^ by the President of Jthe^ Board of Trade.I am circulating to the Cabinet the new draft of tho Safeguarding of Industries Bill as remodelled by the Cabinet Co mm it tee.The method of safeguarding the key industriesremains as before - vis.- a duty nf 33 ofc.     She following changes are, however, now made.     Gas mantles have been removed from the schedule (on the ground that widespread complaint might arise from the household users of gas) and the class of chemicals has been somewhat expanded, A clause has been inserted requiring and enabling the Eoard of Trade to obtain information about the output of Key industries, and setting up a Development Committee to watch progress.     On the basis of,the returns obtained, and the reports made by the Development Committee, reports are to be presented to Parliament from time to time.     Further; the duty is not chargeable on goods originating in and consigned from the British Empire.The most important change in the new draft is the in-corporation of the collapsed exchanges part of the Bill with the dumping part.    Abnormal competition arising from either cause has the same effect upon the industries involved, the proof required of injury actual or imminent is the same in both cases, and the remedy proposed is also the same.   In these circumstances the Cabinet Committee decided to amalgamate the provisions to meet both classes ofunfair and abnormal competition,V/hat is now suggested in this composite part of the Bill is as follows.   If there is reason to suppose that action is called for in the case of any particular article, the matter is to be referred to a Committee.   If the Committee decides1
(a) that those artiolos are &quot;being sold in the oountry at prioes less than thoir foreign value, or that thoir importation to being stimulated by the Oollapsed state of the exchange of the country or countries of origin, and (b) that in consequence employment in this oountry Is being or is likoly to bo serious-ly affected; then, the Board of Trade may by Ordor schedule that article, and thereafter on importation from the country or oountries concerned the article will bo subject to a duty of 33 1/3$,If, however, the duty is imposed not on tho ground of collapsed exchange but on the ground of dumping in tho more limited sense, then on proof being furnished to the Customs that any particular consignment was not dumped in this sense the duty is to be remitted or repaid.     In the original draft of the Bill, dumping in this sense was made a punishable offence instead of being subject to duty, but the latter course com-mondod itself strongly to the Cabinet Committee;   and it has the additional advantage of facilitating the interweaving of the collapsed exchange provisions with the dumping provisions.Dumping in the strict sense is now defined as selling in. this Country beneath cost of production in tho Country of origin, but, as this is admittedly indeterminable for administrative purposes, it is stated in the Bill that wholesale selling price at the works shall be taken as cost of production.&apos;Orders made by the Board may be reversed by resolution of either House, and revoked at any time by the Board without reference to Parliament but not without roforenoe to the Committee.(Sgd)   R.S.
