CP.&quot; 265-(P 1.21.2) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 244323rd February 1921.(Received 20th, 2 p.m.)260 S.   Following from Dobbs, No. 48 C, dated 22nd February y :-&quot; Amir holds Accession, Durbar, evening, 26th instant, and has invited British Mission. I sent word that I could not attend unless assured that I should receive no less honour than S. Afghans now suggest S. and I should be introduced to one another in ante-chamber, entering Durbar simultaneously and sitting side by side in centre, precisely opposite Amir. I think that I had better accept this solution. Only other plan would be. for me to absent myself on pica of illness, but this Avould not dispose of difficulty regarding rest of Mission. Please telegraph Government of India&apos;s wishes without delay.&quot;As there was no time to refer the matter to you, following was sent to Dobbs to-day :-&quot; Your telegram of 22nd February, No. 48 C. Presence of Russian Mission and absence of British Mission could hardly fail to have prejudicial effect on negotiations. You should, therefore, attend Durbar as proposed, but confine yourself studiously to formal exchange of conventional courtesies with S.&quot;

FINLAND.H.M. Minister, Helsingfors, reported en 18th February that the French 2a.nlster is still pressing for the appointment of French Officers to organise tho Finnish Navy.   The Finnish Government are determined, however, not to a sic for French Officers.    The question of applying for a British Naval Mission is held up owing to the reduced Naval Estimates and the Finnish inability to meet expenses of the Mission.   The Minister for Foreign Affairs proposes  however, to press the matter at the end of the month when the estimates come up for revision.   He considers public opinion is strongly in favour of British Officers in view of language and high naval prestige.German intrigues are reported to be taking place over a commercial treaty with Finland, Germany offering the return of small Finnish vessels seized at tho beginning of tho war.RUSSIA.Bolshevik Fleet.   Details of the re-organisation of the Fleet have been received, dated 27th January, 1921.   It is stated that the Petrograd faotories are to receive 5,000 tons of crude oil from the fleet, which will further accentuate the fuel scarcity.The Gomel repairing shops are reported to be function-inge   12 ships to date having been reconditioned.   These are presumed to be torpedo craft.The discipline of the. fleet is receiving the special attention of the Soviet Government; surprise visits are paid, during the night and slackness of the personnel is severely dealt with.    Lower deck is cleared for the hoisting of the colours.   Cabins and Officers1 servants ere now authorised. Only guards are mounted and watches kept,   tfo drills are carried out.   The artisan ratings employ their time in risking articles suitable for barter with peasantry.   The anti- Soviet feeling is considered to be becoming more acute amongst the personnel.The strength of the fleet is estimated to be about 12,000.   General living conditions are, however, no better and expeditions in search of food in the adjacent coast villages are now officially ordered.At Vladivostock the Russians,are allowed by the Japanese to maintain 3 T.B.D1s and four snail craft for port duties, lighting, &amp;c. . Only a minimum of small arms are. allowed on board and. all guns have their breech blocks removed.   The Dockyard is used for small repairs.   The Russian Admiral in command of this force receives 25 yon (gold) and a ration card per month as pay.A 1 S T R I A.The Inter-Allied Naval, Military and Air Commissions of Control have been dissolved, as from 20th February.JUGO-SLAVIA.The evacuation of Cattaro was delayed owing to the refusal of the Jugo-Slav Government to give,guarantees for certain Barbour material, the ownership of which was in dispute.
3.&apos;   299JUGO - SUVIA   (Continued) .The Conference of Ambassadors, hovrev-o^ de^^i-toly decided to evacuate Oattaro on 27th February, neSwtting Italians to tow this material into an Italian port on that date, and to hold it in trust until its ownership is established.TURKEY.Turkish Navy.This remains in the same delapidatad condition. No money is being spent on any of the ships except the fGoeben&quot;, upon which there is a lot of unnecessary expendi-ture, although, the Sn&amp;inoer Officer is nervous of working the boilers at sufficient pressure to work the ash ejector.The naval school at Kalki still continues to function,&apos; and aspirants for the School of Music are encouragement-aged, as bands can be used comvorcially in the Public Gardens, etcPersonnel.    At the end of 1920 there were 2,526 Officers and 1,021 men on the pay roll.FRANCE.The ajurien de la Graviere8 has returned to Toulon, having been relieved by the &quot;Oassard&quot; as flagship of the Syrian Division.The boundaries of the Marine Arrondissements have been changed and are now as follows1st Arro ndisserne nt.On the North ... ... the Belgian Frontier.On the South......the river Ay.Chief Port......

PA R T     II,Quantities OiBclahovili propaganda in Ylddi oh, He &quot;brow, Arabic and English are being sent to Pales-vino with tre object of persuading the Jews to throw ofy^he British yoke! and proclaim an independent State of Palestine.Emir Feisal has telegraphed to King Hussein asking him to take immediate steps to stop hostile movements of any kind in Trans Jordania.PERSIA.Detachments of the Cossack Brigade about 2,500 strong with field and machine guns entered Teheran at midnight 20th/21st February.The Cossacks are under the leadership of Riza Khan who said that they were tired of seeing one inefficient government after another in Succession at Teheran, where nobody was making any preparations to oppose a Bolshevik advance which would follow the withdrawal of British troops.    They had therefore cone to Teheran to see to the mSitoer.   They professed loyalty and devotion to the Shah, but were determined to set aside the evil counsellors by whom he had been surrounded.   The^also professed their pro-British s entiment s.They have taken charge of all Government establish-ments and say that in spite of the&quot;emptiness of the Treasury they can form an efficient force without foreign pecuniary aid as oh ere is plenty of money in the country if yotf !mcw where to look for it.   In pursuance of this policy the.&apos;/ have arrested some of the rich men of the town.The Shah has accepted the Persian Cossack regime and has/received Colonel Riza Khan.RUSSIA.The economic distress overshadows everything.   The dissensions in high Soviet circles are reported to be serious as, although Trotsky has been voted against oj the Workers1 representatives, yet he has a very large military following.     The present promising campaign against Georgia is naturally popular amongst this element, and by keeping -:*&apos; the Red Army occupied strengthens Trotsky&apos; s position.The Lettish Representative at Moscow reports that a strike of 14,000 workmen began there on 25th February and still continues.   Better food conditions are demanded by the workmen.   Troops are being employed.GEORGIA.The situation to dal/e on 20th February, 1921 :-The Georgians hold a line 12 idles N.YT. of Tiflis, having evacuated the town on its occupation by the Bolsheviks. The latter are reported to be looting the town.On the Northern front Georgian troops have retired from Sukhtfm but hold a line 12 miles N.&quot;7. of the town on River Bzib.   Georgians are apparently offering no serious opposition to the advance of the Rods along the coast.   The
8.-   301G !5 Q R G I At     (Contd.)French Admiral hasprooeeded to assist by ships1 gunfire the Georgian defence on this sector, the French O*in  s view being that dOi Jure, recognition of Georgia by the Allied Governments makes him responsible for assisting her to the best on his ability) tho ^rench Government have, however, not confirmed his action.    The French Squadron have supplied a small quantity of munitions.On the southern front the situation is obscure. As yet there 3 s no sign of the Turks advancing on Batoum. The nearest Turkish troops are at Shops and are said to nuute r 2,000.    The Georgians have troops at Boskha.   The attitude of the Turks is uncertain and they appear to be governed by an opportunist policy dependent on tho London Conference.   The stabilising influence is their hatred of the Bolsheviks who up to now they have only flirted with, in order to influence the present negotiations over tho Treaty of Sevres.    An alliance with Georgians to resist the Bolsheviks is quite probable and there are indications that the Bolohevik Com.ia.nd is prepared for this volte face and have earmarked troops to withstand a Turkish attack.AZERBAIJAN. An ant&quot;1-Bolshevik rising is reported at Nouka.A Cabinet has now been formed under Herr vonSydkow.G F R K ANY.The Si le si an Plebiscite will tako place on March 20th.

The ostensible reason for this is fear of the reactionary cornicle,)lr5 but it is possible that the true reason nay be fear of a revolutionary movement by Vie Constantinople Greeks.Greek Operations.$he British Liaison Officer, Smyrna, has been informed by General Pa].1:1s that the Greek Government have decline to sanction operations against Kustapha Kemal, for the present, as these rai^ht cause an unfavourable impression at the London Conference.
g R !MI 0 g       &quot;(Contd.)General Papoulos has informed General Harington that all preparations for a Greek advance from the Brusa front have heen completed, and the advance only awaits the sanction of the Greek Government. &apos; 7e also stated that the Nationalist forces south of Adavazar are increasingA R H SSI A.Insurgents in the district of Sherakaha, south-east of Nount Alagez, recently disarmed 300 Bolshevik troops sent from Erivan to disarm the inhabitants.Intercepted messages indicate that there are anti-Bolshevik risings in Armenia, the Soviet Government being overthrown, and a Provisional Government being formed under Vratzian.    The Armenians are said to be advancing on Karaklis.A R A 3 I A.The possibilities of obtaining a concession to exploit the oil wells in the Narisan Group, appear to be attracting the attention to the Italians.      The Idrissi declines to consider himself bound in anyway by the concession granted to the Farisan Islands Oil Co.; but the President at Aden has been instructed to point out to him that by Article 312 of the Turkish Treaty, he is to recognise and maintain pre-war concessions granted by Turkey, in territories now to be detached from Turkey.PORTUGAL.Although 18 days have elapsed since the resignation of the Government, its successor has not yet been formed.
