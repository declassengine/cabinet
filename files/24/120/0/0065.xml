I circulate for the information of-my colleagues a copy of a draft telegram which I propose to send to the Viceroy, together with a collection of telegrams which have recently passed between the Viceroy and myself on the subject of Afghanistan.Draft telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,for consideration.Your telegram dated 1st March, 287 S. Afghanistan. There has, 1 think, been misunderstanding in regard to attitude of His Majesty5s Government towards question of Bolshevik subsidy. Subsequent telegrams were not intended to be read as with-drawing from view expressed in my telegram dated 29th July, and we still strongly hold view that Bolshevik subsidy would in itself be strongest primd facie evidence of arrangements directed against British Government.It is inconceivable to me that the Bolsheviks are going to agree to pay the Afghans money from mere love of that country.   If they are we shall never know it unless we see the exact terms of the Bolshevik agreement with the Afghans, and Dobbs, in whom I, like you, have the completest confidence, is satisfied that they have disclosed everything.   1 shall be very surprised if it turns out that the Bolsheviks have this philanthropic side to their policy ; hut if ,it should prove that they have, I might agree to our giving the Afghans a subsidy as well.   But what apparently you are now proposing, despite everything you know of Bolshevik aims, is in the last resort to make the treaty with the Afghans without a disclosure of the Bolshevik terms and without any stipulation that the Afghans are not to receive money or arms as presents from the Bolsheviks. To this, I fear, I can never assent. I leave it to you and to Dobbs to decide at what stage Afghans must be pressed for disclosure, but natural course would seem to be first to try to get Afghan acceptance of Dobbs&apos; draft, including prohibition of consulates and intrigue, but omitting foreign relations, which I waive,   if Afghans refuse, negotiations will be at an end.   If they agree, disclosure of Bolshevik treaty might next be asked for.   If it is conceded and treaty is found satisfactory, question of Bolshevik subsidy can be considered on its merits, though I should require strong evidence to convince me that it is not intended for use against India.I regret if time has been lost. But it is not policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to make treaty at all costs, and there is a point beyond which we cannot afford to be dragged by Afghan megalomania. It should be remembered that it is Afghans who are asking us for treaty, and not vice versa. I cannot justify to myself or to public opinion here payment of Indian money to supplement Bolshevik subsidy for attacksE. S. M,2nd March 1921.on India.-3477100  3.21a
Collection oi Telegrams relating to Afghan Negotiations.(I? 985) From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,milFebruary 1921.Clear the line.1098. Your telegrams 209 and 213 S. Afghanistan. Course which discussions are apparently taking somewhat alarms me. It looks, as though Afghan line is to procure piece-meal concessions by representing each of their desiderata as being the one thing they really want. 1 am not sure that Dobbs understands my position. Hi by securing Afghan acceptance of our view about the tribes Dobbs meant complete withdrawal of clause 8, I agree that best tactics would be to get it out of the way at once. But in fact proposal is to make what 1. consider to be important concession to Afghans, and perhaps 1 have not made it sufficiently clear that I regard with great misgiving admission of Afghan interest in our tribes, even in qualified form now proposed, and only acquiesced in it as final concession to be made if a treaty entirely satisfactory in other respects is obtained. J. hope, therefore, that Dobbs, while postponing consideration of this clause for the present will display all necessary deter in ination when the time comes.Afghan tactics have further disadvantage, from our point of view, that they spin out time until Bolshevik ratification is received. We know that Bolsheviks have decided to ratify and that emissary is on his way from Moscow. Afghan abandon-ment of request to us for technical facilities also apparently synchronises with Bolshevik decision, from which it may perhaps be inferred that Afghans on their side intend to ratify. I therefore think they should be reminded that His JYlajesty&apos;s Government have no intention of concluding treaty with them unless completely satisfied as to terms of treaty with the Bolsheviks, and that ratification of Bolshevik treaty without communication to us of text as proposed to be ratified will necessitate rupture of negotiations with us.(P 1031) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 221321st February 1921.(Received 10 a..m.)Clear the line.229 S. and 232 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of the 19th February, 1098, has been repeated to Dobbs, and his comments will be communicated in due course. Some of your points, however, seem to be met by his draft treaty you will since have received, and it will save time for us to give you our views on this, at once. As far as we can judge from telegraphic stumnary, all points in i,t are already covered, by your authority, expressed or implied,, and on this understanding we were prepared to instruct him, Dobbs to proceed as proposed in private conference at once. In view of your misgivings, however, as to course discussions are taking, we think it advisable not to anticipate your approval. Not that we share these misgivings ourselves. We feel that Dobbs is confronted with a very difficult task, and is handling it with great skill. Nor do we read Afghan tactics in quite the same light as yourself. They renewed their fight over the tribes in the hope that we might prove amenaible, seeing that events since tlie Mussoorie Conference have placed them, in a stronger position, and made Afghanistan&apos;s. friendship more important to, us, than ever. They stuck to their position up to the last moment,, and then yielded. But, as we mive already said, some face-saving is required to cover their retreat from, impossible position they have had to abandon. We ourselves think that bi-lateral formula we have suggested is innocuous in fact. It will certainly be regarded as platitudinous by Indian public opinion, if it. figures in a draft treaty as Dobbs proposes. In view of your misgivings, however, Dobbs may be relied on to resist it, agreeing to. its inclusion only if an otherwise entirely satisfactory agreement is secured.Abandonment of development clauses has not taken us by surprise. It is probably due (1) to fear of unpopularity in the country of such developments.; (2) to such financial stringency as evidenced by cutting down of pay in Army ; and.(3) to hope that abandonment of these commitments wity induce us automatically to increase cash payments.
(P 1053)        From Secretary of Slate to Viceroy, Foreign Department,23rd February 1921.Clear the line.1172. Your telegram dated the 21st February, 229 S. Afghanistan. Clauses of Dobbs&apos; draft taken separately are no doubt all covered more or less clearly by previous authority, but first feeling produced by comprehensive restatement of position thus supplied, is nevertheless one that we have already gone very far indeed in the way of concessions to Afghans, without securing anything at ail comparable in return. It is to be noted that clauses 2, 3 and 13 all embody concessions which it had been contemplated would only be given as parts of thoroughly satisfactory general settlement. In particular, it was contemplated that Torkhaiij would be used for bargaining purposes and only given as a final concession see my telegram dated the 1.9th December. I do not gather precisely what procedure Dobbs proposes to follow in putting his draft to Afghans, and of course full discretion must be left to him, but if intention is to put whole draft before them at once should it not contain some material for bargaining? Again, I feel that it should be possible to secure something more in the way of return for our expenditure than Dobbs&apos; draft promises. I do not overlook your telegram 1502 of 31st December, but would again suggest that possibility should be considered of adding some such provision as that it will be open to the Government of India to offer the Afghan Government, and for the Afghan Government to ask of the Government of India, friendly advice in regard to the foreign relations of Afghanistan.Furthermore, in view of reference to subject in your telegram, I must repeat, to avoid possibility of misunderstanding, that whole position must continue to be governed by Afghan-Bolshevik proceedings. We can sign no treaty with Afghans unless and until we are satisfied that there is nothing in Bolshevik treaty directed against our interests. If, therefore, Afghans ratify Bolshevik treaty without coinmu-nicating it to us, and if it proves to contain clauses hostile to us, negotiations will lapse, and Dobbs must choose moment at which to inform Afghans of this. We cannot, in my opinion, be satisfied, in the circumstances, with security given by clauses 14 and-15 of Dobbs&apos;draft. In. particular it should be understood that any treaty which provides for payment of a subsidy to the Afghans by the Bolsheviks must, ipso facto, be held objectionable. (See para. 1. of my telegram No. 2921 of 29th October last.) It is a question for consideration whether a strong stand might hot also be made against supply of aeroplanes and arms to Afghans by Bolsheviks outside their treaty.Subject to these remarks, and to following queries on points of detail, I agree that,Dobbs may be authorised to negotiate on the basis of his draft as a maximum in the way of concessions, and that he may similarly be given discretion to increase subsidy up to 201 lakhs, and to make it date from conclusion of Rawalpindi treaty.As regards details of Dobbs&apos; draft I wish to offer following remarks :-Clause 5 and Schedule. I have not seen Afghan Appendix I. (6), but assume it is unobjectionable.Your criticisms regarding negotiations with Bolsheviks are in part met by Dobbs&apos; draft clauses 15 and 16. Every effort will be made doubtless, by Dobbs, to secure text of proposed Bolshevik treaty before ratification.As regards subsidy, we consider an increase over that proposed under the aide-memoire is due, in consideration of our release from the indeterminate commitments under the development clause. We therefore support Dobbs&apos; suggestion. Indeed, we go further. HabibulkuYs subsidy amounted to 20fr lakhs. Hence, if Dobbs finds himself pressed up to 20 lakhs, Ave feel that he should go up to that limit, for the docking of the odd half lakh would be regarded as gratuitous pin prick. If he can secure satisfactory settlement, in these very difficult times, in subsidy granted to Habibulla, he will have done well. 20   lakhs represents, after all, but a few days&apos; expenditure on a frontier expedition, and is a small premium to pay for a peace-on-the-frontier policy. Of our views regarding gravity of the situation, should a settlement with Afghanistan fail to eventuate, you are already aware.In short, we urge that Dobbs be authorised to negotiate on the lines of his draft treaty, by private or public conference as he may think best, up to limit of 20.V lakhs subsidy.
(I:1 .1231) From Viceroy. Foreign and&apos; Political Department, 2546&apos;2Sth February 1921.(Received 1st March, 10 a.in.)Clear the line.2S5.S. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of the 23rd February, 1172. Following from Dobbs, No. 53 C, dated 27th February : &quot; Secretary of State&apos;s telegram shows that I have failed to represent present atmosphere of Kabul. Afghanistan, having gained control of her foreign relations, is now swayed by two main ambitions. First, since she recognises her weakness between two powerful States, to acquire friends and arms from every possible quarter without compromising her independence of action (? by omitted) exclusive reliance upon either party, and without ruining herself by incurring overt enmity of either. Second, to become champion of Islam, and obtain moral, if not physical, ascendancy over neighbouring Moslem people, which would gradually increase as her first ambition was realised. To gain object under first head she might at present go far to meet British views, provided she was assured of sufficient funds from us, and provided that her compliance was not so great as to provoke Bolshevik hostility or lose her Bolshevik support. But she will not, unless forced by war, again surrender control of foreign relations, nor consent to rely exclusively on Great Britain, whose ultimate ascendancy she fears more than that of Russia. She exaggerates our difficulties, but believes they are temporary, and that few years may re-establish our security. On the contrary, Bolshevik regime seems to Afghans more trying menace, but unlikely to last, vide Nadir Khan&apos;s remarks at the third official conference. She feels necessity of therefore staving off immediate danger of Russia, but does not lear that exclusive reliance on her at this juncture will lead to (? her) permanent domination. If forced by British attitude to lean for the time being on one State alone, she will accordingly prefer Bolsheviks, and trust to our temporary weakness,or pre-oceupation to save her from attack by us until she is stronger. She hopes to get enough money out of the Bolsheviks to tide her over the next year or two. For Islamic ambitions (? therefore determined to) wait, though she will not forego without struggle attempt to pose as playing prominently, (? if not) arranging for better terms for Turkey (? and) our tribes. Meanwhile, our position in Asia has steadily deteriorated. What we might have got out of Afghan combination at Rawalpindi, we could not have got in Mussoorie. What we might have (? got omitted) bad we immediately accepted Amir&apos;s invitation in October, after the fall of Bokhara, we cannot get now that, owing to strengthening and success(es) of Turco-Bolshevik combination, &quot;hostile influence of Jamal is predominant, and has revived Afghan suspicions of Great Britain. What, we might have got on our first (? arrival) we cannot get after ratification of the treaty with Bolsheviks. What we might get now we shall not get soon, if Tehran coup results in Bolsheviks overwhelming North Persia, or if abortive London discussions about Turkey further inflame Indian Moslem sentiment. It is a question of sybilline books. It follows that we cannot hope by (? peaceful) means to make Afghans discard Russian subsidy, or admit any control by us of their foreign relations. If we make demand(s) in this direction, and then withdraw them, we shall only earn their contempt and increase their opposition (? to us omitted) as being willing to wound and yet afraid to. Nor can we gain any of our ends by peaceful means unless we pay and make some concession to 34,77 B .Clause (i. I am not clear whether reference is to towns or districts. I presume it will b&apos;e made clear that prohibition of Other foreign Consuls in Afghanistan covers whole Eastern frontier zone. Would it not be better to specify a zone limited by a line parallel to frontier? As regards British territory, I understand meaning to be that foreign Consuls are not to be allowed between Indus and Afghan frontier,Clause 8. I assume intention is merely to give full rebate of Customs duty on Afghan Government stores and not to exempt them from Customs supervision.Clause II. I presume para. 3 of aide-memoire will be reproduced as a definite undertaking by the Afghan Government and not a mere statement of British expectations.in communicating my views to Dobbs, please express my confidence in him, and my appreciation of skill with winch he is handling very difficult situation.
Afghan amour-propre. It may be said that game is not worth the candle, and that it would be better to fight Afghanistan at once and bring her to heel before she has grown in strength. I will not burden this telegram by argument on this theme, but if His Majesty&apos;s Government come to that conclusion it would be best for me to leave immediately. Meanwhile, I shall, of course, not make concessions about Torkham or other points unless I see our main objects of Afghan neutrality, prevention of Russian propaganda.and cessation of intrigues&apos; with tribes, cannot be otherwise gained.   I await orders about Russian subsidy.&quot;Our comments follow.(P 1234) From Viceroy, Foreign, and Political Department, 25832$th February 1921.(Received 1st March, 8 a.m.)Clear the line.2856 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of 19th February, 1098. Following from Dobbs, 50 C, elated 23rd February : &quot; Your telegrams Nos. 228 and 230. I shall of course be entirely guided by view of Secretary of State. I would point out that formula regarding tribes in clause 13 of my draft is much more innocuous than suggestion in last part of para. 25 of Government of lndia&apos;s Despatch No. 155 of Kith August 1892 to continue former practice under which both India and Afghanistan punished tribes, and which Lord Lansdowne&apos;s Government said Lad produced fairly good results. Formula hardly seems more compromising admission of Afghan influence than Government of India&apos;s invitation to Habibulla in 1916 to restrain Mahsuds.&quot; Periodic consultations between British and Afghan officials was one of desiderata of Government of India during Lord Ourzoifs Viceroyalty, vide para. 4 of aide-memoire given to Dane, and last paragraph of Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 28th November 1904. Regarding course of negotiations, I am naturally anticipating Afghan attempt to increase their advantage or lessen their obligations under each head of agreement, and I shall not be surprised it they refuse absolutely to give undertaking to have no Russian Consulate or agent near British frontier, proposed in my clause (3, as this would probably wreck their Russian Treaty. As point is vital, 1 shall, unless I receive orders to the contrary, break off negotiations and return to India on such refusal. If, however, Afghans accept all my clauses with merely minor alterations, Treaty would, I think, on paper at all events, give all guarantees that we require against possible Bolshevik designs, and it would seem unnecessary to push demands for disclosure of Russian Treaty to point of rupture, unless His Majesty^s Government consider it impossible to leave it doubtful whether Aghanistan is to receive Russian subsidy. If Afghans deliberately intended to deceive, they could always produce bogus or incomplete Russian Treaty, and we should therefore be no better off from their having pretended (? to omitted) disclose it. Bolsheviks may, however, publish their Treaty with the Amir, partly due to boastfulness and partly for the purpose of propaganda, and Afghans can never feel assured against such a course; they are therefore unlikely to (? contract) engagements with us which subsequent Bolshevik disclosures might prove to have been contracted in bad faith.&quot;(P 1234)     -       From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 25941st March 1.921.(Received I pan.)Clear the line.- 287 S. Secret. Afghanistan. My immediately preceding telegram. Your telegram of the 23rd February, 1172, caused us considerable surprise, and we can only regret that we have apparently failed to bring home to His Majesty&apos;s Government exceedingly delicate character of the situation in Kabul.Our view from the outset has been (vide our telegram of 12th October last, 1214 S.) that, as much as we may object to Amir&apos;s trying to get the utmost out of
both sides without committing himself against either, it is not in our power to object effectively. Any attempt at insistence that we must be sole purveyors of assistance to Afghanistan would he interpreted by Afghans as a set design to reduce her to dependence, and refusal to enter into treaty with us would be almost inevitable result. We must confine ourselves therefore to insisting on exclusion from any Bolshevik agreement of provisions designed, directly or indirectly, against, us, or calculated so to operate, e.g., Bolshevik consulates on our borders.We read your telegram of the 30th October last, 2021 (vide especially the words &quot;agreement on the line (sic ? lines)), indicated by evidence at our disposal&quot; and &quot; subsidy on condition of consulates &quot; as an acceptance of our view in principle. We read your telegram of the 8th December last, 3880 (vide the words &quot; treaty with Bolsheviks which includes provision of an obviously anti-British character, such as -establishment in Eastern Afghanistan of Bolshevik consulates &quot;), as an acceptance of our view absolutely.To this view we strenuously adhere. We are confirmed in it by Dobb&apos;s weighty appreciation of the situation, which wo commend to the very earnest consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.If Afghans refuse to meet us over the Bolshevik Consulates, we agree with Dobbs that there is nothing for it lint to break off negotiations, keenly alive though we are to the grave consequences this may entail. On the other hand, should we gain this crucial point, the only chance of Afghans refusing Bolshevik subsidy if one is still offered them, would be for us greatly to outbid it, by doubling or trebling ou.r subsidy.From the Afghan point of view it must be remembered that our subsidy represents a (? rise) of about Us. 2. 8 in monthly pay of Afghan Army, whereas at least double is apparently required with present high prices to keep it contented at existing strength.The upshot of the matter is that we cannot compete with Bolsheviks in auction, nor can we afford to leave them in sole possession. If in the end we are compelled, to acquiesce in subsidies on both sides, Bolshevik failure, sooner or later, to fulfil their engagements is not improbable.   Nothing could suit us better.Much valuable time has been lost and we may be already too late, unless Dobbs&apos; disclosures over Bokhara and Bolshevik machinations generally turn the scale in our favour. We, therefore, urge that authority be given to Dobbs with least possible delay to proceed with negotiations on lines proposed, seeking, if possible, to secure prior communication of actual terms of Bolshevik agreement, and bearing in mind, wherever practical, your various desiderata, but taking his final stand only against inclusion of the terms in Bolshevik agreement definitely directed against us, eg., Bolshevik Consulates on our borders.
