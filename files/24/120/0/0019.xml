(I? 985) From Secretary of Stale to Viceroy, Foreign Department,&apos; l[)th February 1921.Clear the line.1098. Your telegrams 209 and 213 S. Afghanistan. Course which discussions are apparently taking somewhat alarms me. It looks as though Afghan line is to procure piece-meal concessions by representing each of their desiderata as being the one thing they really want. I am not sure that Dobbs understands my position. If by securing Afghan acceptance of our view about the tribes Dobbs meant complete withdrawal of clause S, I agree that best tactics would be to get it out of the way at once. But in fact proposal is to make what I consider to be important concession to Afghans, and perhaps I have not made it sufficiently clear that I regard with great misgiving admission of Afghan interest in our tribes, even in qualified form now proposed, and only acquiesced in it as final concession to be made if a treaty entirely satisfactory in other respects is obtained. I hope, therefore, that Dobbs, while postponing consideration of this clause for the present will display all necessary determination when the time comes. 9Afghan tactics have further disadvantage, from our point of view, that they spin out time until Bolshevik ratification is received. AVe know that Bolsheviks have decided to ratify and that emissary is on his way from Moscow. Afghan abandon-ment of request to us for technical facilities also apparently synchronises with Bolshevik decision, from which it may perhaps be inferred that Afghans on their side intend to ratify. I therefore think they should be reminded that His Majesty V Government have no intention of concluding treaty with them unless completely satisfied as to terms of treaty with the Bolsheviks,&apos;and that ratification of Bolshevik treaty without communication to us of text as proposed to be ratified will necessitate rupture of negotiations with us.
