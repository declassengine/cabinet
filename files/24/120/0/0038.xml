/      A        1^This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 222 SECRET. X 1CP. 2633.THE CABINET.(Home Affairs Committee.)GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND MARKS BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. I circulate herewith a draft Government Contracts and Marks. Bill which has been prepared in accordance with a decision of the Home Affairs Committee at their 7 2nd meeting.2. At that meeting the Committee had before them two separate bills, one dealing with frauds in connection with Government Contracts, the other with the unauthorized application of Government Marks, and they decided (l.) That the bills should be combined and resubmitted.(2.) That the Admiralty and War Office should submit to the Board of Trade a memorandum dealing with the Marks specified in Part I. of the Schedule of the Government Marks Bill, and(3.) That the Parliamentary Counsel should prepare for the Committee a note on the statutory position of Government Marks.A memorandum has been sent to the Board of Trade in accordance with (2), and I understand that the Parliamentary Counsel has prepared and submitted a note to the Committee in accordance with (3).3. I would draw attention to the fact that the Schedule of the Bill has been revised. When the preparation of the memorandum for the Board of Trade was taken in hand the War Office raised the question whether the Marks in Part I. of the Schedule, especially the first item, could not be made more specific. This part of the Schedule is almost exclusively the concern of the Admiralty, and that department after carefully considering the matter agreed to the substitution of &quot; blue, red or yellow jute thread laid up with the yarn &quot; and &quot; white jute thread laid up with the wire &quot; for the much wider description of mark previously specified, viz., &quot;white, black or coloured worsted threads laid up with the yarns and wire respectively.&quot; It is thought that this alteration will remove any reasonable ground for objecting to the item in question.Similarly in the case of candles &quot; blue or red cotton threads in each wick or wicks of red cotton &quot; becomes simply &quot; a blue thread in each wick.&quot;The last item in this part of the Schedule &quot; blue stripes of flax thread in the warp &quot; in terry towelling is new and has been included at the request of the Admiralty.In Part II. of the Schedule the &quot; double broad arrow&quot; and the &quot; Admiralty clear anchor &quot; have been added. The former, which is used as a mark by the War Office, was not previously specified separately, as it was thought to be already covered. The latter is included at the request of the Admiralty.4. There are two further points to, which attention should be drawn (l.) The words &quot; proof whereof shall lie on the party accused,&quot; which in the previous draft were included after &quot;lawful authority or excuse&quot; in the clauses corresponding to 2, 3 and 4 of the present Bill, have been omitted in accordance with what is believed to have been the Committee&apos;s decision. I desire to press for the reinsertion of these words, to which great importance is attached by the Director of Public Prosecutions. There are precedents for their use, e.g., in the Public Stores Act, 1875 ; the Coinage Offences Act, 1861, and the Official Secrets Acts, and I do not think it can be considered unfair that a person using or obliterating a well-known Government Mark should be liable to be called upon to justify his action. It is clear that, unless the words are reintroduced, the three sections will be practically inoperative.(1521/108)   100  2/21   H&amp;S, Ltd.  8993wo
(2.) The Parliamentary Counsel has pointed out that the provisions of the draft Bill, in so far as they relate to Government Marks, would be more appropriately included in the draft Merchandise Marks Bill, recently circulated by the President of the Board of Trade, and would attract less attention if so (included. &apos; The Board of Trade have accordingly been asked to agree to this course, but their views have not yet been received. If the proposal is approved, I shall be glad to have authority to introduce Clauses 1, 5 and 6 as a separate Bill, as originally proposed.L. W.-E.The War Office,February, 1921.
