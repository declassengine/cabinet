REPLY BY THE GREEK DELEGATION H&amp;UDBD TO LORD CURZON ON MARCH, 10, 1921, at 5.15 p.m. TO THE PROPObALb IMBED TO THM OH THE SAME DATE AT 10.30 a.m.(I)PROtfO&amp;ALb IN REGARD TO SMYRNA EAJDED TO THE GREEK DELEGATION AT 10 DOMING bTKEET, S.W., ON THURSDAY, MARCH 10, 1921, at. 10.30 a.m.1. The Greeks to be allowed to keep a garrison in Smyrna tmm.2. Order t.? be maintained in the rest of the btenjak by a gen-darmerie with Allied Officers tc be reoruitea in proportion to the members  and distribution of the population (as reported by a Commission (Inter-Allied) not the one v*e have proposed).3. The same proportienal arrangement - equally according to the report ef the Commission - to be made for the administration,*   If there is a Greek majority this will ensure their real control of the oountry, more especially if there is4. A Christian Governor to be appointed by the League of Nations and assisted by an Elective Assembly and an Elective Council.5. As an off-set to this the ccantry so administered vould be called the Vilayet of Smyrna, and. As proposed by the Prime Minister, this morning, it vould remain nominally under Turkish sovereignty even if, under the &quot;propor-tional&quot; arrangement   ef the administration, the real oontrol &apos;.\as Greek.7. The Christian Governor would be responsible for the payment t* the Turkish Government of a fixed annual sum whioh might be augmented with the prosperity of the province.   It had better not be oalled &quot;tribute&quot;, as that terra might, for opposite reasons, give both Greeks and Turks something to cavil at.8* Our great object is to get a provisional-arrangement now, and Caoe, i.e. th tide over tie period v,hen this particular point s over-heated.   The heats will diminish.   te should therefore add that this arrangement would be reviewed in, say, five years, on the demand of either party, by the League of Nations.
1, Accepted on the understanding that the strength of thegarrison ig to he fixed by the Greek Government and will be e&amp;^7t!&amp;uted to secure the vilayet against any incursion.2. The &quot;cadres&quot; of the gendarmerie to be recruited from localelements and its organisation to be entrusted to Greek &quot;cadres&quot;, the latter to command the gendarmerie pending the recruiting and instruction cf lecal   cadres&quot;,   The Commission to determine the proportioned participaijon of the various local elements in the gendarmerie wovJ d appear tc be unnecessary.     A better and simpler way would be to hold a ballot vote, the results of the latter to serve as a basis for the proportional participation in the gendarmerie. 3. Accepted with a reservation as to the Commission which isregarded as unnecessary for reasons stated above.   A minimum representation (e.g. one-third) should be stipulated for minorities except in cases where there is only one occupant to be nominated, the occupant in such cases to be chosen from the majority, &apos;4. The ^oyooU *ro &quot;be nominated by tire Greek Government subjectto the, approval of the.Leo.gue of Hat ions, or to be nominated by the League of Nations on the proposal of the Greek Government * 5&quot; and 6.    Accepted. 7. Acoepted with the proviso that Turkey and Greece slia.lleach receive a quota only after deduction cf the expenses of &apos; the administration and of general chargee on the territory(including those of the upkeep of the garrison).   It is desir-able that a minimum and a maximum sum be fixed for the Turkish quota. &apos;RiUHiY BY THi5 nST^^ratio^&apos; HAHMD TOLORD 003203 03 IIMCH 10th, 1921 at 5.15 p.ia.

The Greek Delegation after careful study of the Memorandum communicated to It by Lord Curson 03? Kedloeton, desires., in the first place, formally to state its inability to admit the principle of the revision of the Treaty of Sevres.     The Greek Delegation cannot but continue to regard the latter instru-ment as constituting the lawful basis on which the relations of the signatory States with Turkey must rest.However, in its desire to facilitate the work of mediation undertaken by the British Government in a spirit which It fully appreciates, and with a view to an immediate and durable re-establishment of peace In the   Near Bast, the Greek Delegation has the honour to inform the British Government In strict confidence, that, in the event in which it should prove possible for the British Government to secure the acceptance by Turkey of the conditions laid dawn in Lord Curzon!s Memorandum as modified in the appended Note, it may count on acceptance by the Greek Government of an additional Protocol to the Treaty of Sevres defining the Internal organisation of the Smyrna territory as outlined in the said Memorandum and Note.Tt Is, however, understood that the signature of suchaa Protocol would be conditional on the maintenance of all other clauses of the treaty and on immediate and full application of these clauses on the part of Turkey.London, 10th March. 1921.Whitehall Gardens,11th March, 1921.,
