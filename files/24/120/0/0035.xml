Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.Telegram from Vicoroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 23rd February 1921.Clear tbe lino.   354 Pol,ttudair. In the course of the discussion in Council of Stale un the 21st, on motion to adjourn house to discuss Indian Moslem representation at inter-allied Conference now sitting, the Home Member undertook to cable to you views ol: Moslem Members of Indian Legislature. Following are representations which they have asked to be telegraphed : &quot; (1) Turkish independence and autonomy should be made a reality. It should not remain a fiction as it is at present under the Treaty of Sevres.&quot;(2) Thrace, Adriauople, Smyrna, and such, other parts oi Asia Minor as are predominantly Turkish in race, should be given back to Turkey, subject to the protection of minorities in those provinces.&quot;(o) All Arab provinces should be given complete autonomy without any direct or indirect control or interference of any non-Muslim Power. They should be left alone to themselves as the Mussalniaus of India consider it contrary to the last will and injunction of the Holy Prophet that any non-Muslim Power should exercise any control or authority over these provinces.&quot; (-1) All holy places of Mussulmans should be placed under the suzerainty, if not the rule, of the Sultan of Turkey, the Khalifa of the Mussulmans.&quot;Our own impression is that these demands ask for more than would probably meet expectations of moderate element in Mohamedan population, and we are confirmed in this view by Bhurgri&apos;s speech in opening debate. Jt is true that he also asked that full autonomy should be granted to Arab provinces by setting lip Arab Governments there, but impression which, debate has left on us is that grant of demand No. 2, and of some suzerainty (Bhnrgri himself used the words &quot; suzerainty, however, nominal &quot;) of Sultan over Mecca and Medina would go far to allay resentment now felt by moderate Mohamedans,&amp;us    100 2.21
