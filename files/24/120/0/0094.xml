I. A R A P H R A 3 S.. Proa: General inland, Rhine Army.To:-  War Office.Acting on orders from home, rhineland High Commissismer proposes to ?pass an ordinance to institute a customs barrier on our bridgehead boundary east of Khine and will probably ask for military post to be established along bridgehead to ?supportcivilian customs officials in oarrying out their duties.   The perimeter nf the bridgehead is 50 miles and is traversed by 7 railways and B3 main roads.   Provision of necessary posts andreliefs on main roads alone will, I estimate, require the 4battalions detailed in jour telegram 8806$ tf.E.LAi* averaging 430 strong; further no provision is made In this estimate forpatrolling the frontier between the main roads, the efxicientperformance *f which will require at least 2 more battalions?or the equivalent ?In cavalry.   It is impossible to spare anymore troops for the purpose frca the present garrison of Cologneas I already supply troops for the Railway Ccntrol posts.Institution of Customs tariff ?may lead to industrial unrest in my area and consequently it is ?very desirable that garrison here be strengthened and Labour Companies retained as requested ?in my letter Uo.5793*.JLJtoroh 1st.
