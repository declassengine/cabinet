Bill provides that those Councils shall be deemed to have made adequate arrangements for the treatment of tuberculosis so long as the scheme or agreement continues in operation, and tho Bill imposes no further obligation upon such Councils.Of the remaining 10 County Councils and 16 County Borough Councils, all but one have made some provision for the treatment of tuberculosis, but in certain cases the provision only extends to dispensaries and in others the arrangements made for treatment in Sanatoria or hospitals do not extend to insured persons,   Clause 1(2) of the Bill therefore provides that if any of these Councils fail to make adequate arrangements for the treatment of tuberculosis, the
their powers in relation to the treatment of tuberculosis(other than the power of raising a rate or of borrowing money) through a committee or sub-committee of the&quot; Council, and to appoint on the committee or sub-committee persons (including members of Insurance Committees) who are not members of the Council but are specially qualified by training or experience in matters relating to the treatment of, tuberculosis.
