Tho bright spot Is that the national Conference of the Labour Party and Trade Union Congress votod against direct action yesterday.   The proceedings were stormy at certain times, but they refused to allow &amp; delegation of uneiaployabloe to address them.   Xt had been the intention of these people to make a raid on Lyons1&apos; te&amp;shops t but as this was known in advance there were sufficient Polioe present to overawe them.Trade Unionism is confronted with a crisis.   International trade depression and a lack of statesmanship has deprived labour of tho initiative and this is inclining leaders towards a reasonable attitude.   I generous policy on tho part; of employers might now pave the way towards real oo-operation and industrial peace.   It Is in the hands of both sides to bring about the social stability of the country.The activities of the Red International of Trade Unions has alarmed Trade Union officials;   It may result in a cleavage between tho Right and Left, the Left wing going over to the Communists and tho great mass of the workers swinging towards the Right.The struggle between the moderates and the extremists will bo continued this week in the Miners1 Conferences.   Fortunately, the Union funds are depleted and for this reason the Left will scarcely obtain a hearing for a militant policy.   The Miners1 unofficial reform movement is spreading..    The/
Tho railway signalmen are restive and threaten unofficial action if their claims are not settled at an early date.   An impasse appears to have been reached with the shopmen.Details are given of the new draft constitution and rules of the Communist Party of Great Britain.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has frankly admitted that its circulation is declining.There is definite evidence that Sinn Fein has embarked on a campaign of arson in this country.   There was another outbreak in the Manchester area on February 19th and plans are being made for the manufacture of incendiary bombs.   There is also a plan for blowing up Runcorn Bridge a few hours before the Royal train reaches it on its way to Liverpool.
THB COAL MINERSAccording to tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot; the circulation of the questionnaire detailed, in&apos;my last report has resulted in the following decision V-&quot;All present district percentages to he consolidated into a new 1921 standard wage; Sankey wages and war wage .- total 5s. per shift - to be a combined flat rate in addition, payable over the whole country on the same terms as at present.&quot;All future increases to be flat rates (so &quot;much per shift) payable over the wholo country.&quot;The miners accept, as a basis of negotiation with the owners and the Government, the principle of a minimum profit for the owners, bearing a definite relation to the miners&apos; standard wage.&quot;They also similarly approve of the surplus in tho industry (after meeting the standard wages and \ minimum profits) being divided between the parties.&quot;The actual relation of wages to profits will-be decided upon if and when the general principles are accepted by the owners.&quot;        , .The South Wales coalfield is reported unanimously to favour a flat rate, with flat rate increases or reductions.,- , iV. , There is.no evidence to show that the&apos;miners will accept early decontrol;   at the same time the steadier leaders will offer determined opposition to a bellicose policy, for the funds of all the associations are depleted, while those of the South Wales Miners1 Federation are said to be practically exhausted..   If, therefore, a-Strike did occur, it would almost&apos;1, certainly be accompanied by disorder., for strike pay .is essential to the preservation of peace. &apos;, The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has worked much mischief with its disclosure of an alleged plan of the mine owners1 for a national lock-out.   Unemployment In the industry, whioh is increasing weekly, is causing the men to think that there may be some foundation for the story.THE/
THB MINBRS1 UNOFFICIAL RgQBM committees the rapidity with which this movement is spreading may he gauged from the fact.,thai delagataa. from 30 lodges in Durham and I^rthumDerland, representing a total membership of about 70,000, attended a conference at Newcastle on February 19th.   Tho delegates for the mos part held merely watching briefs, but the fact that they were instructed to report to their lodges indicates the interest which the movement has awakened.   J.R. Campbell, the notorious Clyde shop steward, was the chief speaker. George Harvey, North Eastern organiser for the Red International of Trade Unions, also spoke.A.V. Williams is still active in the South Wales coalfield, while tho unofficial propaganda is making headway in Fife and Lanarkshire,THE! BSD INTERNATIONAL OP TRADE UNIONSReports from all over the oountry show that this movement continues to make progress:  Great Britain has been divided into eleven areas:, eaoh of which is in the &apos;  charge of a fall time organiser, who is paid a* salary of  5 or  6 a week and expenses.   George Harvey, in the North&apos; Eastern area, R. Foulis in East Scotland and . H. Pollitt in London have been most successful during tho week, while the least success has been obtained, so far, in Yorkshire.The British Bureau met in London on February 23rd, a sub-committee conferring with a sub-committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain on the same day.   The latter body has appointed a delegate (Arthur MacManus) to the,Bureau, which in turn is entitled to send a representative to meetings of the Communist Party Executive, when the affairs of the Red Internationalare/
are under discussion.The Red International has incurred a hill of 125. 17. 3. with tho labour Research Department: amongthe items are:16,000 envelopes U 13/- per 1,000 -  10. 8. 0.32.900 &quot;        &quot; 27/6   &quot;      &quot; -  45. 4. 9.560 hours     $   l/3   &quot;   hour -  35. 0. 0.257 &quot;        &quot;   1/6   &quot;      &quot; -  19. 5. 6.,Page Arnott, who is a member of the National Union of Journalists, appears to be an active worker for tho Bureau, which has just issued a manifesto to the &quot;British Trade Union Movement&quot;, drafted  presumably by Robert Williams, but signed by all members, to whose names are appended the unions of which they are members.   This manifesto is little more than the familiar attack upon the Amsterdam International and its leaders.Pollitt has been instructed to find offices for the Bureau in London, but has not yet succeeded; during the week he has concentrated on the boilermakers, among whom a special appeal has been circulated.   The Bermondsey branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union has passed the resolutions.Tom Dingley, who is now making a propaganda tour in South Wales, was active, in conjunction with Gallaeher, in Coventry last week.   The-movement has made some progress in this city, as capital has been made of the inability of trade union officials to deal with unemployment, while the miners&apos;leaders have been denounced for the last settloment. Pit committees have been formed in the district and the unemployed are listening with greater interest to the doctrines preached.The Red International has now gained a footing in the following places: Birkenhead, Darlington, Gorton, Halifax,Woolton/
Woolton (Liverpool) and the outlying districts of BirminghamIn the North Eastern district, George Harvey, who isthe driving force of the local miners&apos; unofficial reformmovement, as well as organiser for the Red International,has made arrangements for a &quot;Northern Coalfield Red Section&quot;conference to be held at Newcastle on Maroh 5th, and hashad 500 credential cards printed.   He states that the&quot;strongest part of the movement here is that composed of irish people&quot; and is making a special effort to win the mover.   With this object in view, the conference on March 5thwill consider a special resolution which &quot;congratulates theIrish working olass upon their noble and most gallantstand against the Black and Tans&quot;; and expresses the hopethat &quot;the fight will go on until the Irish people areabsolutely free, and have set up in Ireland the Workers&apos;Republic.&quot;    Harvey has also issued a manifesto to localtrade unionists in which he urges them to copy theircapitalist &quot;masters&quot; who are organised internationalists, andjoin the red movement.A good indication of the progress made by the RedInternational in East Scotland is provided by the localorganiser&apos;s report, parts of which are of interest sufficientto justify quotation:&quot;Fve been in Fifeshire all week, outstanding feature, the tremendous&apos; difference that exists between the revolutionary outlook of the miners generally and the reactionary attitude-of all otners.&quot;Tuesday, 8th inst., in Cowdenbeath, quite evident good seed has been sown here.   Villages Ldchore, Fordell, Kelty and Donisbristle visited.   Except miners every trade official interviewed, apathetic, indifferent or reactionary.   Circularised many branches of 22 different trades and arranged a conference in Cowdenbeath on February 27th.&quot;&quot;Thursday at Bowhill, miners, enginemen, farm servants; Cardenben, Lundonald, Leslie, Bowhill, miners Red.   Ploughmen in district poorly organised, many non-unionists. &apos; Interviewed local secretary and arranged for delegation to attend conference at Bowhill&apos; on Feb. 19th. - -:
&quot;By Friday evening I had names and addresses of all branoh secretaries of unions in the area stretching from Salial Valley to Rosyth and from  in^seat and Ralbeath to Torryburn.   Saturday forenoon and afternoon in attendance at Fife Miners&apos; Offices here as our resolutions to come up at Board mooting.   Result, Fife Minors, 53 branches in all, declared endorsement by a majority.   In evening addressed aggregate meeting of Inverkoithing, Kelty and Dunfermline.   Farm servants, favourable reception but &quot;International&quot; an unknown quantity despite the fact that Duncan, their organising secretary was at Amsterdam,   Sunday at noon., preliminary meeting in Cowdenbeath and an assurance of miners propa-gating inside other trade branches in. district.&quot;Conference held in Edinburgh on Monday.night. Committee of 22. set up to work district, 9 for &quot;Intensive Campaign&apos;, 5 for &quot;Speakers or Essayists1 and 8 for &quot;Literature1.   Many unions not held meetings, but . delegates to be co-opted.All Miners Branches.Red  -   Lochore, Glencraig, Lochgelly, Lumphinnans,Cowdenbeath, Raith, Bowhill, Cardenden, Leslie, Dunfermline, Lower Blairhall.&quot;Progress has also been made at Airdrie, Alloa, Cathcart, Dumbarton, Falkirk, Glasgow, Govan, Uaryhill, Paisley, Parkhead and Stirling.The Red International has more hold in the Amalgamated Engineering Union than in ,other junione., and the organisers are fully alive to this fact; Murphy contributes a lengthy &quot;Appeal for a Now Policy for the Engineering Workers&apos;1 to the current issue of &quot;The Worker&quot;, and the rebel element within the union is working to effect alterations in the Constitution and Rules.It is. not uninteresting to note that in Franoe this Red movement has received a set-baok this month:   the &apos;&apos;&quot; National Confederal Committee decided, by 82 to 31 votes, that the Confederation G^nerale du Travail should be controlled by French citizens and not by Moscow.unemployment the adjourned national conference of the Trade Union Congress and Labour Party was held in the Kingsway Hail 1 yesterday.   It is satisfactory to know that it decided in -favour/ &quot; . ...;-
favour -of con-s1 1rutJdmal &amp;b opposed to revolutionary action., The speeches of the prominent trade unionists made it clear that their present object is to rehabilibate Labour in the eyes of the general public.   The meeting passed a resolution declaring the/Government policy of extending the Unemployment Insurance Act to be &quot;lamentably inadequate&quot;, demanding work or maintenance for the unemployed and advocating constitutional action wherever feasible.   There was considerable opposition from &quot;Red1&apos; delegates, including Robert Williams, who demanded that a deputation from the unemployables should be allowed to speak.   Several bands of the latter, numbering many hundreds, oonverged in Hyde Park, where speeches wore made.   At 2.15 they formed up in a procession, headed by a band, and, accompanied by about 50 women, marched via Oxford Street to, the Kingsway Hall.   About 3.45 they dispersed.I had information that it was intended to organise a raid on Lyons&apos; shops in the Strand neighbourhood and a considerable number of police were posted to prevent any disorder.   This overawed them and everything went off quietly.   .On February 19th the South Wales miners met at Cardiff . and passed a resolution that &quot;drastic action&quot; be taken within 14 days to force the Government to adopt the policy of , the,Labour Party for dealing with unemployment.The unomployables in London are more restless.   They created much disorder at ,the Byrmondsey meeting, which was addressed by George Lansbury and Dr. Salter on February 18th, in fact they broke it up.   On the same dfiy, four young men took possession of an unoccupied cottage at 23, Kintore Street, Bermondsey, acting, it is stated, on the instructions of the Bermondsey Unemployed Ex-Service Men.Unemployment in Lancashire and Cheshire is still increasing.   On February 11th the number of unemployed on the live register was 105,932, an increase of 2246 on theprevious/
mm    7    *mprevious week.   Moreover, the periods of stoppage are now so prolonged that the position of partially employed workers is almost as bad aB that of the wholly unemployed.   This is specially the case in the cotton trade and ootton mills are substituting for short time stoppages of 10, 14 and 21 days. This is the pass at Ashton, Blaokburn, Preston and Darwen. Some trade unions have oeaoed to pay further benefits with the result that distress is increasing.   Tae following were the numbers of wholly unemployed in this area on.February 11th: -	Men	Liverpool	12,199	5,538&quot;       Old Hall St.	1,936	-Bootle Reg.

Unemployed ex-soldiers in Liverpool number 15,400.   About 2,000 took part in a demonstration in Liverpool on February 15th; they marohed through the prinoipal streets to Exchange Flags,.where speeohes were delivered by Councillor Harry Walker and others. They passed a resolution calling on the Lord Mayor to consider unemployment among ex-Servioe men, and they also complainsfll of the bad arrangements at the Employment Exchanges, where men were kept standing in the rain vtoen Drill Halls and other buildings could have been used for, the purpose.   A second resolution urged all men in regular^ employment to o^trij^le Is. a week with a contribution from the employers of Is. a week for every man in theiremploy./
employ, the money thus raised being used to take on extra men from the ranks of unemployed ex-Service men.Naturally the revolutionaries are making the most of their opportunity.   They preach the doctrine that unemployment has been brought about by the capitalists to force the removal of the Excess Profits Duty and to lower wages.Unfortunately,, lack of organisation is giving thern some material.. It is reported from Manch ester tnat during, the week large quantities of ?ood fish were sent to the destruotor and that at Fleetwood 2,000 stone of whiting were sent to the Fish Meal Works, because merchants could no dispose of them.   These things are noticed and commented on by hungry men.In Birmingham there will be opposition to a reduction i wages, although unemployment remains acute.   The Old Hill Miners&apos; Association and the Brass Workers oppose any rediiction but boat builders in the Birmingham Black County have agreed to a reduction of 6d. an hour.In Coventry, owing to the activity of Emery, the temper of the unemployed is changing for the worse.   They listen more readily to revolutionary speakers and say that their condition could not be worse under, any social system.Employment is good in the pottery district round Stoke-on-Trent, but there is a slump in, the local ironstone and steel industries; at, present, however, there/Is, little distress. .There is acute distress at Leicester and, Nottingham, Where the State Insurance money is declared to be inadequate to meet the cost of rent and food.,   Much short time is being worked in the boot and shoe trade;,the,hosiery workers are firmly opposed at present to a reduction,in wages.,; ; . Glasgow/
H    9    ***GlaBgow has had a disturbed week: the Labour councillors have caused   tumult in the City council by their opposition to the plans for entertaining the Prince of Wales and have in their turn been violently assailed by McLean&apos;s , hooligans, because the Council refused to accept responsibility for the maintenance of the local unemployed.   On February 16th ex-Bailey Wheatley, Miss Stewart and Canon ?&amp;8ain failed to obtain a hearing at the Labour Party meeting in the City Rail. Some 2,000 people were present and after a free fight E.McShan0, one of McLean&apos;s lieutenants, mounted the platform and announced that he had &quot;promised to allow two of tho promoters of the meeting to speak&quot;, provided that he also addressed the meeting.Peeling in Glasgow is running strongly in regard to John McLean and hie followers and it is generally maintained that his activities, which are a menace to order, should be curbed: the Labour Party are anxious that this should be done, as they are frequently the target of his attacks.   He is joining forces with a group of irresponsible from Dundee, with whom a conference was held on February 19th.   Letters were -read from the London unemployables and a provisional national council for Scotland was formed, with J. McLean as secretary.   The Dundee delegates stated that arrangements had been made to take over the Stannergate shipyard, with the consent of the workers employed th&apos;ere, on February 21st.There is little doubt that distress and revolutionary feeling are keeping pace in Glasgow, but it must be remembered that a hooligan element is invariably a noisy one.   There is no reason to doubt the loyalty of the great mass of the population of the West of Scotland who view with disgust the irresponsible gang led by McLean, who are acknowledged to be potentially more dangerous than all the local communists and Sinn Feiners combined.   The loyalists would deeply regret anypostponement/
postponement of the Prince&apos;s visit, which the extremists would hail as a victory, hut it is quite likely that there will &quot;be some kind of. hostile demonstration during the course of the Prince1s visit.   This, however, would ultimately rocoil upon the herd of the extremists, for the great&apos; body of Glasgow men would regard any breach of hospitality to their Royal guest   as a personal injury and would deal with it severely.   It would, however, be trumpeted to foreign countries in an exaggerated form and thus do considerable mischief.A PLOT TO BLOW UP HPHOOH BRIDGEInformation has been received from more than one source that the Sinn Feiners in the Liverpool area are discussing a plan for blowing up Runeorn Bridge before the R05&amp;I train, conveying the King and Q,ueen to&apos; Liverpool, reaches it.   There is no intention of injuring the Royal Family.   The act would be committed some two or three hours before the arrival of the train, but after it has left London. All possible precautions are being taken.THE&apos; COMMUNISTS &apos;The British communist movement is passing through a new&quot;chorepBase: on the one hand/is an improvement in organisation, which is more securely controlled by Moscow than heretofore^ together with the fruitful field offered by unemployment. Against these factors must be set a species of trade union reaction, due largely to the fear of the steadier labour leaders that their positions will be imperilled if the rebel element be not quashed, and to the knowledge that direct action, whether   threatened or attempted, spells failure at the polls.   Communists have, moreover, a very real fear ofarrest/
arrest and most of the speeches made this year have been just within the lav;.   The political as distinct from the industrial communist movement presents, as a whole, the spectaole of a car with the engine running at full speed and the gear in neutral.21he Communist Party of Great Britain is circulating to branoh secretaries of the Party a draft constitution and rulea:-OONSTITUTIONAlms and objectsThe objective of the Party is the establishment of a COMMUNIST REPUBLIC of a sooially equal people. It works for the total abolition of the present system of wage slavery through a social revolution, and holds this to be PREEMINENTLY the task of its existence. It seeks by EDUCATION to win the adherence of the masses to communism, and by AGITATION to spur the workers on towards tho Social Revolution.   The Party is affiliated to, and adheres to the Statutes and Theses of   the Third Communist International.Methods;As a method of attaining the Social Revolution, the Communist Party urges the adoption by the workers of Great Britain of ihe Soviet or Workersf Council system so successfully applied in Russia.   As a necessary-&quot; means of achieving the transition from capitalism to communism the Party stands for the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.   It realises that capitalism will challenge every inch of the ground covered by the advancing working class, and) aware from the experience of history of the dangers of counter-revolution, it holds the dictatorship of the revolutionary masses to be the only safeguard against subversive conspiracy and counter-revolution.Immediate action the Communist Party will devote itself to the immediate work of educating the masses in the principles of communism.   It will conduct an unflinching campaign against the power of capitalism and relentlessly strive by industrial organisation, agitation, and revolutionary political and parliamentary action to urge the working class on towards revolution.RULESBranoh officials must include a chairman, secretary, treasurer and two auditors and, if necessary, a propaganda secretary and committee; six members can form a branch which must meet at least once a fortnight.

William Leslie, who was in Russia last year, made a violent attack on John S, Clarke and William Gallachor on February 20th.   Re stated that both   these men had represented to Moscow that Great 3ritain was on the verge of revolution and that they were &quot;out only for a career at the expense of the working classes.&quot;    Clarke had caused a disturbance in one of the Russian hotels because he had not enough to eat and endeavoured to induce other foreign delegates to make a joint complaint: so bad did matters&apos;become that Gallacher threatened to shoot Clarke.   Leslie then proceeded: to liken MacManus and the Communist Party of Great Britain to a &quot;sot of vultures&quot;. They should, in his opinion, adopt underground methods, instead of advocating publicly the arming of the workers. The speaker&apos;6 own plan was to&quot;get in touch with soldier socialists and. to give them books to pass on to their comrades.Communists on the Edmonton Borough Council show symptoms of tyranny: they have dismissed their architect, who objected to a project for providing work for the unemployed by making a recreation ground.   They are also making things uncomfortable for the medical officer aifyl the engineer and are criticising the librarian.LIVERPOOL/
Liverpool central council of vigilance committees the activity of the shop stewards&apos; movement has been reflected in Liverpool in the recrudescence of Vigilance Committees of the dockers, National Amalgamated Union of Labour, building workers, waggon builders, shop assistants, oarters, oo-operators, bakers, electricians and the unemployed.   a central council representing these trades has been formed, with     Brad&amp;ook, the Industrial Workers of the World and communist extremist, as chairman,   William Gallaeher^e visit to Liverpool had the object of propaganda for this movement, but his arrest proved a serious handicap.MAY MTEmboldened possibly by the knowledge that as May 1st falls this year on a Sunday, its celebration will not entail any loss of wages, the revolutionaries are well under weigh with preparations for unpomi&amp;Led demonstrations.   A &quot;First of Hay Celebrations Committee&quot; has been formed in London, on which trade unions, trades councils, Communist, Labour and Independent labour Party branches, Co-operetive societies, socialist organisations, the National Union of Ex*Servioe Men, the herald League, Shop Stewards and unemployed organisations are represented.   London has been divided into six areas for purposes of organisations and the demonstrators will be mobilised on the Embankment, whsnoe they will march to Hyde^ Park.   An evening meeting in the Albert Hall also forms part of. the programme, provided that the Hall can be obtained.Similar preparations are also being made in the provinces, and present indications point to record processions and meetings.
THE &quot;DAILY HSBALD&quot;Signs are not wanting that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is finding the role of ohamelaon increasingly difficult to play: its efforts to blend red and yellow have resulted in a nondescript colour which offends trade unionists and communists alike. On February 19th George Lansbury published a lament entitled &apos;0ur friends, our fortunes and our future&quot;, in which he writes, &quot;Frankly our circulation has fallen and we shall take an oarly opportunity of publishing another auditors&apos; certificate ... circulation is the thing we most of all desire to maintain.&quot; In regard to the Northern edition, Lanebury states that the National Union of railway men.is taking a mortgage on the land and buildings up to nearly two-tiiirda of their certified value - or about  20,000, leaving  14,000 to be found.   &quot;Of this we are sure of  10,000.   The National Union of railway men has not, so far, boen able to invest in our debenture stock ... as to other unions, about half-a-dozen, including the Nottinghamshire miners have conditionally promised sums - ranging from  500 to  5,000, but up to tho present we are very far short both in promises and actual cash of the amount we need.&quot;   Either Lansbury&apos;s arithmetic is at fault, or he is relying on his readers&apos; short memories, for it was expressly stated in the offioial circular of November last that the Manchester building oould be obtained for  46,000, the plant for  25,000, while the working capital required was  100,000.The editor has a word of advice for the co-operative movement, which &quot;is making its own appeal for capital&quot; and refused, last week, to invest  500 in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, the -Board considering that the Go-operative Press itself needed development.   &quot;No ono&quot;, he proceeds, &quot;wants northern, western, eastern editions more than I. do ,.. I feel heart-sick at being obliged to put them (our supporters) off with words, butenthusiasm/
enthusiasm, desire, even love itself, must be expressed indeeds.   We cannot raise a building, instal machinery, employ a new staff without money, and lots of it.   We are unable togive this ourselves, or to get it from private persons,although qnite a number of such have already given usconsiderable sums ...&quot;&quot;Finally, I want to make an appeal for toleration, and I make this to old trade unionists and to my Communist comrades and friends.   This pa^or cannot be the slavish servant of either while I am Editor.   ],Iy sens of fair play consists in giving publicity to news I disagree with as well as those I agree with-   This paper belongs not to tno right, left, nor centre of tho movement, but to the whole body of organised Labour&quot;All we ask is that in judging us friends should try and believe we try to exercise our beat judgment. We try to give fairly news of the movement as a whole, and our conception of a newspaper devoted to the Labour movement is that if it fails to do this then it * -deserves to become extinct ...&quot;We ought to discuss all our differences frankly, fully.   There is no sense in shouting that we are one if we are not.&quot;The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; announced on February 22nd that anumber of lecturers had been engaged and were ready to attendtrade union branches to explain &quot;the necessity for Labourowning and controlling a Press as powerful as the capitalistiPress.&quot;   Lecturers are available for Lancashire, Cheshire and Yorkshire: Durham, Northumberland and Cumberland; South Wales: the Home Counties.   This experimental campaign, if it materialise, will undoubtedly resolve itself into an attack on the capitalist. Press: past attacks have had a very unsettling effect upon the minds of the workers and counter-action would be well worth while.   Analysis of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; for almost any period would provide proof of its inaccuracy and distortion and&apos; misrepresentation of facts.CONVICTIONS/
On February 18th, T. D. 0&apos;Sullivan and James iloran, who were involved in the Wandsvvorth oil works arson conspiracy, were sentonced at the Old Bailey to eight years&apos; penal servitude each: V7.B.P, K^nny was sentenced to four   years&apos; penal servitude.On February 21st H, Webb, a member of the executive committee of the Communist Party of Greet Britain, was convicted at Sheffield of being a disturber of the peace and an inciter to commit divers crimes,   he was bound over for two years in the sum of  100   with two sureties of  50; or in default three months&apos; imprisonment.SINN PaiM III ORJSAT Britain there being reli&amp;ble information that Sean, McGrath, the Secretary of the Irish.Self-Determination Loague, was actively fomenting the commission of outrage in this country, an Order was made by the Rome Secretary under the Restoration . oif Order in Ireland Regulations on the 2lat, for his intern-ment in Ireland and he was removed to Ireland under escort on the 23rd.As the result ofthe seizure of documents of the General Staff for the Irish Republican Army in Dublin, it has become olear that we must be prepared for a systematic campaign of arson-in this country, principally in agricultural districts, where the Police are not numerous.   Such a campaign will be difficult to deal with, for nothing is easier than to fire a rick or cut a telephone wire.There was another outbreak oi arson in the Manchester district on February 19th: damage estimated at about  25,000 was caused at eight farms, all the outbreaks occurring between7/
7 and 9.30 p.in.   Six shots wero firod, without effect, at a  Ifarmer in Sale; two men were arrested.Sinn Fein aotivity hss assumed a new phase in Liverpool,of which my correspondent sends the following account:&quot;Shortly after midnight on Friday, February 18th, a hold up by armed men supposed to be Sinn   Feiners, took plaoe at three shipping passenger boarding houses ii the North End of Liverpool.   In one case   the passport and tickets of all the young Irishmen in the house who were about to sail for America on Saturday wore seized without any attempt to conceal the character of the visit, and in the other the raiders passod themselves off as police officers.   The papers of the young women in the establishments were not touched.&quot;12 men entered the boarding-house 96-98, Great Howard Street, occupied by Hose Casey.   They said they we detectives from Liverpool, and after questioning five of the young men lodgers, took their passenger tickets for the Cunard.-Liner 1 Carmsnia1, then left.   One man (a raide: was armed with a revolver.&quot;Later, a dozen men went fco the boarding house, 48, Regent Street, occupied by David Lilley.   After say we they were police officers they forced their v&amp;y into the house.   One demanded to see the register, and others went upstairs and searched four young Irishmen.   They took passports and tickets belonging to two of them and ordore them to get back to Ireland at once.   Then the raiders &apos; left the house.&quot;Later about 20 men went to a lo^Lng house, 23-25, Regent Street, kept by a man named Christie.   Some of the raiders had revolvers.   They took tickets and&apos;passports of several young Irishmen - emigrants.&quot;One man has been detained pending enquiries.&quot;Various branches of the ^rish Self-Determination League in our area are disclaiming responsibility for the outrages.   Public indignation in Manchester and other districts where the,outrages were committed is very great and there is a movement on foot in Rochdale whioh has for its object the organising of the Cotton Workers to refuse to work.with Irish people, whom they are certain are responsible for the fires.   The people are convinced  hat the aim of tho culorits wrs to destroy as much property 8 possible and thereby bring about a further-amount of unemployment and distress.&quot;-On February 17th Dr. Mahnix addressed a meeting of about 2,000 people, mostly Irish, at the Ivlechanics&apos; Institute, Burnl an overflow meeting was held in the Weavers1 Institute.   Dr. Man nix said that the British Government was training people inIreland/
Ireland who might yet have occasion to make their mark not unon the Irish people, not upon Irish Creameries, but upon English men   and women and upon the factories and towns of Lancashire and &quot;Yorkshire.   He would give them in the words of Be Valera.   (Loud end prolonged cheors).   If ever he got to Ireland he would give De Valera their message.   President Do Valera said the Black and Tans and auxiliaries, and soldiers were torturing prisoners, were guilty of tho assassination of men and boys, in their homes, on the streets and in prison. (Shame).   They were murdering women and children and clergymen. (Shame).   They were outraging Irish women and Irish girls, and if the information that reached him could be relied upon there was more behind that statement than he would be prepared to speak on a public platform like &quot;that.   De Valera said, &quot;They are flogging and maltreating groups of civilians taken&apos; from the villages and countryside.   They are issuing and enforcing orawling and such-like humiliating and degrading orders.&quot;   He couldumdai&apos;stand a man standing before another man and shooting him, but he could soarely   understand a brute who took another man, stripped him naked, and made him crawl along the road.   (Shame).   He was no man who did it.   (Applause) It was a disgrace to this country and it was a disgrace to civilisation.   Yet those were things done in the name and with 1 the cognizance - he did not say with the approval - of the Coalition Government.   When the whole world was shocked by the burning of his own city of Cork an enquiry of a kind was &apos; granted, and it was carried out by the Government&apos;s own minions&apos; or nominees, and a report was drawn.up which they were ashamed and afraid to publish.   But no.injury that the publication of the report could do the Government could be greater than the .withholding of the report must do.If they were going to give Ireland her own Army and %vy
if she wanted - he did not know that she did - and put heron tho same status as luatralia, thay would be giving hertho right, if she wanted to exercise it, of cutting thepainter altogether.   There was   little or no differencebetween full Dominion Home Rule ana,&apos;full and complete independence.   It seemed to him tht-t the Irish had register?a desire for complete independence.   If he were the PrimeMinister he would do what he could by offering full DominionRome Rule and asking Ireland to try it.   After calm and deliberate judgment, they could take a plebiscite to say whether they were satisfied or not.   If they thought theywould get better benefit from a Republic, he would abide bythe decision, and no little seotion in the North East ofIreland would be able to stand in the way.The following resolution was passed:&quot;That this monster meeting of the citizens of Burnley, under the auspices of the Burnley branch of th IriBh Self-Doterminetion League, specially assembled to do honour to Arohbishop Mannix, demands the instant removal of the Government nan unjustly restricting his Grace1 s personal liberty,&apos; and further that copies of the resolution be forwarded to t^e Prime Minister, Rt, Hon. H. R, Asqulth, Ilr. Clynes and the looal memlei of Parliament.&quot;The Rochdale branch of the Irish Self-Determination League has started a series of lectures, with the object of &quot;giving the public an intelligent grasp of the Sinn Fein movement, its origin and objects.&quot;&apos; The first lecture was attended by about 600 people on February 16th.On February 20th, Seamus 0!Xelly and Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington addressed a meeting of tho Irish So lf-De terrains t League at Cardiff: the 500 present were reproved by 0&apos;Kelly because the local branch of the League had a membership of o 1,200 although there were 30,000 people.of Irish origin in Cardiff.   Mrs. Sheehy Skeffington gave her usual account of /appalling outrages alleged to have been committed by thei rservants of the Government.IRELAND/
ireland there has been a slight increase of outrages in Ireland.... An important capture of Irish Republican ^rcay documents in Dublin on the 19th has been--of great use to the Police in this country.Practically all the young men in County Cork have been mobilised by the Irish Republican Amy.There was a noticecblo- decrease in the number of serious crimes not due to Sinn Fein or agrarian agitation.   The Martial Law areas continue to furnish most of the serious Incidents. Attacks on passenger trains were made on February 17th and on February 18th.   In the first caso a train in which police were travelling was held up near Askoaton in Co. Limerick, fire being opened from both sides of the line; there were no police casualties but one girl was slightly injured.   The police drove off the attackers.   In the second case a passenger train containing a party of police was fired on at liseelton Station in Co. Kerry; fire was returned by police who suffered no casualties.In a fight between military and police and a party of rebels in Middleton, Co. Cork, 13 of the latter were killed and 0 captured,The Sinn Fein papers appeared as usual.   &quot;Old Ireland&quot; devotes a considerable amount of its space to the criticism of the Lenten Pastorals of &apos;our inscrutable Bishops&apos;.   &quot;Young Ireland&quot; continues to discuss ttje effect of the Belfast boycott and also alludes to the threat of war between America and England.   There is nothing of much importance in either paper but both are, no doubt, of great value to the Sinn Fein party for propaganda purposes.
