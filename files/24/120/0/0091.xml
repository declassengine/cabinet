(Reference C.U,,22nd Minutes, Conclusion 3).The Cabinet Committee on Unemployment recommend to the Cabinet that as a means of relieving unemployment next winter, financial assistance should be given to the schemes for Light Railways in Devonshire (Torrington) and South Wales (Gower Peninsula) referred to in the enclosed luemorandum from the Minister of Labour (CU.141).      The Committee base their recommendation on the fact that the schemes&apos;are supported by four separate^ Departments - the Ulnistry of Transport, Ministry of Agriculture, Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour.The financial aspect of the schemes is set out in thefollowing passage in the Memorandum&quot;The Torrington-Halwill Light Railway is estimated to cost  327,000 but it is possible that economies may be effected which would reduce this figure.   Local Authorities and Interests have -promised to subscribe  100,000 and it was proposed to the Treasury that the Minister of Transport should be authorised to subscribe a maximum of  180,000 with the proviso that the Promoters would be informed in the first place that the amount of the subscription would be only  150,000. .The Sower Peninsula Light Railway Scheme is estimated by the Promoters to cost  189,000 and the maximum assistance upon which they can count,locally at present:is  50,000.&quot;(ad.)

MEASURES FOR THE RELIEF OP Utl^llPLOYMEMT. . .b   i      i i. mi ii -    i in ii........       * -.....* ........iii  ....  aCONSTRUCTION OF LIGHT RAILWAYS. Mono by the Minister of Labour.I desire to draw the attention of the Committee to certain considerations in rog.T d to the hearing of Light Railway Schemes upon the present unemployment situation. The Minister of Transport has had under consideration several proposals for the construction of Light Railways in various parts of the country and advises me that of the schemes considered the most promising are proposals for the provision of light railways from Torrington to Halwill Junction in the County of Devon and from Killay Junction to Port Eynon in the power Peninsula, South r.&apos;ales.The Minister of Transport was prepared to consider favourably the grant of financial assistance&quot; in respect of these proposals under Section 7 of the Ministry of Transport Act, but having regard to the principles laid down for the restriction of Public Expenditure in the Treasury.circular letter P.2355 of the 17th December, 1920, he felt &quot;unable to press the Treasury to sanction grants merely oh the ground that improved transport facilities would bo secured^At the request of the Minister of Transport I liave considered the value of these two schemes from t;e point of view of the provision of work for unemployed persons, and on the 1st February, my Department intimated to the Ministry of Transport that the; could give unreserved support to the South &apos;.-/ les scheme having regard to the
exceptional unem2&amp;oyiiS9 rt &quot;p 07yLte&amp;$ in tho portion of South &quot;/ales ooccverned.    As regards the North Devon scheme, the Ministry of Labour intimate a that they could support tho scheme from the point of vie;; of relief of unemployment only on tho understanding that a substantial portion of tho labour required for the oon&amp;tev.otion of tho Light Railway would be drawn from distrijtJ cuch as Barnstaple, Exeter or Plymouth where there existed serious unemployment.I understand that tbe Ministry of Transport hiave sinoe consulted the Treasury in regard to these two schemes, and have been informed thai; the Treasury are unable to agree to any departure from tho prinolplos laid down in the circular lottor referred to above.The Torrington-Halwill Light Railway is estimated to oost  327,000 but it is possible that ooonomios may be effected which would reduce this figure.    Local Authorities and Interests have promised to subscribe  100,000 and it was proposed to the Treasury thai; the Minister of Transport should be authorised to subscribe a miximum of  180,000 with the proviso that the Promoters would be informed in the first place that the amount of the subscription would bo only  150,000.The Gower Peninsula Light Hallway Sohemo is estimated by tho -Promoters to oost  189,000 and the maximum assistance upon which they can count locally at present is  50,000.The following additional facts are relevant to theconsideration of the proposals,(l) Landowners have undertaken eitherto make free grants of land, or to accept payment in shares.(2) I Both schemes are classified by theMinistry of A3riculture and by the Board of Trade as &quot;desirable at the present time.&quot;
(3) Of the total estimated cost of the two schemes the amounts likely to be spent on direct labour are, in the case of the Terrington-Halwill Scheme, approximately £110,000 and in the case of the Gower Peninsula scheme, approximately £80,000.

(4) The completion of tho first two miles only of the Gower Peninsula line would render possible the opening up of a colliery from which an initial output of 500 tons of coal daily is expected.

(5) It is claimed on behalf of the Torrington-Halwill scheme that it would not only provide immediate relief for unemployed persons in Devonshire and certain parts of North Cornwall, but would contribute materially to the opening up of a large agricultural, timber-bearing and clay producing area.

(6) The Halwill-Torringtcn scheme is strongly supported by the local Authorities in the district which would be served. Those include the Devon County Council, the Torrington Rural District Council, the Holsworthy Rural District Council and the Okehampton Rural District Council, each cf which has agreed to contribute substantially towards the cost. In addition, I have received representations supporting the scheme from the Chairman of the Hatherleigh Parish Council, from the Meeth (North Devon) Clay Company limited, from Lord Clinton and from local Members of Parliament.

(7) As regards the Halwill-Torrington. scheme for which, as I have previously indicated, labour could be drawn from Barnstaple, Exeter and Plymouth, it should be recorded that the number cf men unemployed in those towns at present is respectively 648, 1,142 and  3,244. The seriousr?s of the situation, is shown by the fact that in Bar?staple the number unemployed represents 18% of the total male insured population; in Exeter the corresponding percentage is 10.4, and in Plymouth (including Devenport and Keyham) the percentage is 7.9.     In addition unemployment is undoubtedly serious in Bideford where there are 233 mon unemployed representing 8.l% of the insured male population.

(8) The Cower Peninsula scheme if put in hand would provide for the needs of the unemployed of Swansea where the number of men unemployed at present is 5,697 representing 26.7 per cent. of the insured male population.

In the light of the foregoing considerations there is, in my judgment, a case for reconsideration of the decision in regard to those schemes and, in commending the proposals to the favourable.


consideration of the Committee, I desire to remind thorn that, if Baftotion is to ho given for the grant of financial assistance tc either or &quot;both of the schemes from the money provided in the Ministry of Transport&apos;s estimates (miscellaneous Transportation bchemes) for tho current financial year, all necessary arrangements fcr ess:sting the undertakings by a Government subscript3or tor rteck 3n the PromptinA&apos; Companies must be completed before the era of March.(Signed)   T. J. IttCWAMAIU.Ministry of labour, 4/3/gl.
