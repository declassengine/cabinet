Following from Dobbs, 42 C, dated 16th February :--&quot; Can you confirm special cable published by Englishman 9th February, regarding mutual agreement between Great Britain and Soviets guaranteeing independence of Afghanistan and Persia.   This agrees with information given to Tarsi by Surits.&quot;Gable states that Chicherin, in note to Curzon objecting to terms of Anglo-Russian agreement, has stipulated for a mutual agreement for independence and integrity of Asia Minor, Afghanistan-and Persia. Is statement correct ? It is most important in connection with Kabul negotiations for us to know how negotiations with Bolsheviks are proceeding.
