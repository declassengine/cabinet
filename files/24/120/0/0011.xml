Memorandum by the Food Controller *1.        The Conference of Ministers, held on Monday,&apos;! Oth January, requested me to prepare and furnish to the Cabinet a Memorandum specifying the duties of an Emergenoy Organisation both at Head-quarters and in the provinces, after the winding up of the Mini-stry of Food, with an estimate of the expenditure involved.2.        Briefly stated the duties of an Emergency Organisation are to ensure adequate supplies and equitable distribution of foodstuffs during any period when the ordinary channels of supply and distri-bution vrere dislocated by reason of industrial disturbance. In the event of a breakdown of railway transport, for example, it would have to direct or operate a complete system of transport, including coastal services for the bulk distribution of yeastj road services for the bulk distribution of milk, vegetables and other perishable foodstuffs, involving not only traffic regulation  but the acquit sition of vehicles and vehicle parks and the enrolment of the volunteer personnel *3.        The Organisation required for the purpose is already in exist-ence at the Ministry of Food, and I do not think that a more effi-cient or economical organisation could be devised. It consists at present of(a) a small Headquarters staff(b) a provincial staff consisting of twelve Divisional Commissioners, nine in England, one in Scotland, and two in Wales - and their assistants.4. The duties of the headquarters staff lie mainly in the issueof general instructions to the Commissioners, and the preparationof model schemes which are adopted in the provincial areas withlooal modifications.   In addition the headquarters staff makes the interdepartmental arrangements which such preparations necessarilyinvolved, regulates the use in Emergency of such Government stocks
as the Ministry may possess? and oo-ordinatos any action on the largo wholesale supplies of private stocks which, under normal circumstances would be available for more than one Division. The Ministry stocks will, of course, steadily deoline since no new pur-chases are now being made; but the highly important question of the interdivisional relations will always remain so far as the supply and distribution of traders stocks are concerned. This matter must necessarily require considerable attention at headquarters.The work of the Emergency Organisation in the provinces may be summarised as follows(a) Making and keeping continuously up-to-date a general survey of stocks in the Division, sources of supply to the Division, tho trade channels by which supplies arrive and are distributed; all ao far as the main articles of food are concerned. This work can be readily carried out by periodic consultation with Committees of the principal wholesale trades or with representative traders; and by a simple system of returnst(b) Knowledge of the transport requirements9 especially for the movements of the large wholesale supplies. This know-ledge can also be obtained and kept up-to-date by consul-tation with trade committees; or representative traders.(o) Registration and Inspection of vehicles suitable forrequisition in an emergency, (d) Preparation for the requisition of vehicles,e, ., points to which vehicles are to be delivered; parking arrangements; enrolment and payment of volunteer labour; repairs, petrol supply; and accounting arrange-ments,(o) Planning out the routes, and quantities to be lifted;arrangements for taking over, accounting for and deliver-ing goods; arrangements for pooled collection and deliver-ery to Committees of retailers. These arrangements re-quire careful and detailed planning in advance, especially in the case of perishable goods such as milk and fish2.
which must he handled immediately on the outbreak of a Railway Strike. Other foodstuffs are not so urgent as t&apos;jo; e are generally sufficient stocks in the shops to last for some time.(f) Arrangements for the requisition and redistribution of foodstuffs if that course should become necessary In con-sequence of the inadequacy of the emergency transports(g) Arrangements for the dealing with derelict foodstiffs at Railway stations on the outbreak of a Railway Strike (especially the perishable foodstuffs).I have been requested to offer suggestions as to what functions other than strike work the Emergency staff could porfoxtn In times of industrial peace9 and as to which Department they should come under.In my view it is important that the State should at all times be In possession of full information as to the country1s food position. A Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence has already drawn attention to the embarrassment caused by the complete absence of any information as to the stocks of foodstuffs in this country at the outbreak of the War. and I think steps should be taken to create a Pood Survey Branch of the Board of Trade to continue the Ministry of Food&apos;s machinery for keeping up-to-date information as to our requirements of foodstuffs, the amount produced in this country, the amount required to be imported from abroad, our normal sources of supply, prospects of foreign harvests and supplies and the alter-native sources upon which we might have to rely in time of War. If such a Pood Survey Branch were constituted, it would naturally form the nucleus of the Emergency Organisation and its staff would be employed in times of industrial peace not only on preparations for meeting emergencies, but in collecting statistics, and dealing with such problems as the storage of foods.Such a department might also usefully maintain the register of food traders now in existence.   In 1917 the work of the Ministry of Food was impeded by the absence of a register of ^iiolesaiers and
retailors dealing In certain of the essential foodstuffs, and a register of some 500,000 of these traders has &quot;been built up. The Food Survey Branch mitfht be made in part, at least self supporting by requiring dealers in foodstuffs to register annually, and to pay a small registration fee. I am informed that meat traders at any rate would welcome the continuance of registration, and I believe it would not be difficult to secure the goodwill of other food traders to such a scheme. The Minister of Health has already requested that the registration of meat retailers should be continued until the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee has been received, and has expressed his intention to ask for powers to maintain permanently the registration of milk dealers.The Board of Trade have already,assumed responsibility for con-tinulng certain of the Ministry of Food!s returns, and provisional arrangements have been made for the inclusion of the Divisional Commissioners in their capacity as Enforcement Officers on the Board of Trade (Food) Vote.I attach a note by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry as to the staff which he thinks would be required and the expenditure which would be involved. This nucleus staff would in normal times lay out the plans and in an emergency would expand by the absorption of vol-unteers into an effective organisation. In the appointment of the &quot;peace time&quot; nucleus staff every effort would be made to obtain persons who would serve without payment or for small salaries or for retaining fees. Among the present Commissioners there are quite a number who, being either pensioned military or civil officers, or owners of private businesses would, I am confident, be willing to serve on such a basis as I have indicated. And their experience would be well worth retaining.CHARLES A* McCURDY.Ministry of Food, . 21. 2. 21,
EMERGENCY organisation note BY THE PERMANENT SECRETARY TO THE MINISTRY OP POOp AS TO STAFF RETIRED AND EXPENDITURE INVOLVED.In estimating the number of staff required, and in deciding tho manner in which it should be organised, I am guided by the following principles!&quot;(i)   The nucleus organisation must comprise asufficient number of responsible officers possessing the necessary experience to deal with the technical? lties of food supply and distribution.   It must, moreover, be capable of rapidly absorbing and con-trolling from the outbreak of emergenoy a con? si&amp;erable number of untrained workers, without y/hose assistance the situation could not be met. (li)  The organisation should be decentralised as far as possible.HEADQUARTERS ORGANISATIONThis should ultimately be staffed as shown in the attached 1st Schedule. REGIONAL ORGANISATION.I think that the country should remain divided as at present, viz into 12 Divisions - nine for England, two for Wales, and one for Scotland.   The Scottish Division should be further sub-divided as at present into three sub-divisions.   Each of the Divisions should bo staffed as shown in the attached 2nd Schedule.I recognise that this organisation may appear top heavyj but this must necessarily be a feature of a nucleus cadre in which responsibility,&apos;Initiative and experience are essential.
4. I consider the staff contemplated, both in the headquarters and Regional Organisation, the smallest that can, with anypretence of efficiency, make and keep up to date the foodarrangements and expand and control them in case of actualemergency.   Should it be desired to impose additionaltheresponsibilities such asAJivil Commissioners Organisation or the Emergency Road Transport Organisation of the Ministry of Transport, I do not think that any additional staff would be required.5. The cost of the Organisation I estimate at  85,000 a year,or about  2. per 1000 of the population.6. I may observe that for the next financial year the costof an emergency service would he from  15,000 to  20,000 less than this estimate owing to the fact that a proportion of the officials required both at headquarters and in the provinces will have other duties not directly attributable to emergency work.F.K.C.19th February, 1921.
