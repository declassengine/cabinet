In selecting the points whioh it i3 proposed&apos; to deal with immediately, the Board have sought to meet complaints that the existing restrictions are unnece-ssarily or irritatin^ly severe, so far as this,can be done without undue risk of an increase of insobrietySecretary, -  ,$he cabinet,2, Vttiitehall Gardens,S.W. 1. &apos;- 1 -
and without prematurely compromising the intended Parliamentary settlement.   In the Board!s judgment these latter considera-tions are sufficient to preclude the Board from making in the present circumstances any material alterations of the hours prescribed for the sale, supply and consumption of intoxicating liquor, though questions of the extension and adjustment af the existing hours, either generally or to meet speoial local circumstances, are prominent among the numerous questions which will no doubt be raised in a general review *f the subject.The Btard propose that, so far as scheduled areas in England and Wales are concerned, the Order required for bringing into effect the alterations described in this letter shall be issued in about 10 days from the present date   The issue of such an tfrder will, of course, necessi-tate the issue, subject tt special consideration with regard tt details, tf a corresponding Order for Scotland.I am, .   Sir,Your obedient servant,(Sgd.)   J.C.G. SYKES,Secretary.J
