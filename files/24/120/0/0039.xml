26.2.21,196PART L-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The question of unemployment continues to dominate the labour situation, and the consequent drain upon the funds of the trade unions is apparently responsible for their adoption of a more passive and defensive policy, and a growing disinclination for extreme measures of any kind. In this connection, it is interesting to note that the funds of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation are said to be seriously depleted already, and that it is proposed to raise a levy in aid of unemployed members.In view of the meeting of the Supreme Allied Council now being held in London, a joint manifesto has been issued by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the National Executive of the Labour Party, maintaining that payment of the war indemnity by Germany would only tend to increase unemployment in this country.The wages reduction movement continues in various parts of the country, being especially noticeable in certain branches of the engineering and metal trades of the Midlands; but no cases of outstanding interest have yet arisen, though, as will be seen below, the present tension in the coal industry is not unconnected with a fear of wages reductions. Following on a meeting of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation at Edin-burgh on the 18th February, the secretary of this body issued a statement to the Press to the effect that the Federation would not put forward proposals for the reduction of wages unless no other means of reducing the cost of production could be found. The recent fall in the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index-number by 14 points from 165 to 151 will, of course, affect a number of trades, the agreements in which are based upon a cost-of-living sliding scale, but in most cases these reductions do not become immediately operative.A serious situation threatens to develop in the coal mining industry should the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain prove unable to evolve a mutually satisfactory policy before the present emergency wages agreement expires on the 31st March. The long-standing difficulties in arriving at such a solution are accen-tuated by certain new factors which have recently arisen, prominent among which has been the issue in South Wales of a considerable number of notices to terminate contracts. The men view with concern the loss of the &quot; war wage,&quot; upon the termination of their contracts, and their officials argue that this step is in violation of the provisions of the Coal Mines (Emergency) Act, 1920. Mr. Hodges has written to the Mines Department on this question, and, in an interview, has accused the Government of acting in such a way as to lead to an attack on wages. A special session of the National Delegate Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation began on the 22nd February to discuss, inter alia, the replies of the constituent members of the Federation to their questionnaire concerning the future wages agreement. The Mining Association of Great Britain have also been in consultation with their members on this question. Such information as is available seems to point to the possibility of a deadlock, on the question of national versus district wages regulation, even if all other difficulties oan be overcome.As stated in a footnote to last week&apos;s Eeport, the executive committee of the Asso-ciated Society of Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen decided on the 17th February that no strike should be called, in view of the Government^ offer to admit the society&apos;s legal representatives to the military Court of Inquiry charged with investigating the Mallow incidents. The Court reassembled on the 21st February with these representatives in attendance.The adjourned joint delegate conference convened by the National Executive of t the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress meets in London on the 23rd February, to consider the unemployment situation. Resolutions advocating political pressure on the Government will be submitted to the conference, and the general tendency would appear to favour this, rather than those other and more drastic measures which were at one time prophesied. - - \;
General Situation-continued.The debate in the House of Commons on the Address in reply to the King&apos;s Speech concluded on the 21st February. On the 16th and 17th, the whole unemployment position was discussed on an amendment to the Address moved on behalf of the Parliamentary Labour Party by Mr. J. R. Clynes, who has taken Mr. Adamson&apos;s place as sessional chair-man of the Party. On the 16th, the Minister of Labour described the Government measures for the relief of unemployment already undertaken, or contemplated, and, in particular, outlined the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) Amendment Bill,* which had been foreshadowed in the King&apos;s Speech. It may also be noted that Mr. George Barker raised the question of the amendment of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act in the course of the general debate on the&apos;15th February, and Mr. Hartshorn the question of the termination of contracts in the coal mining industry, especially in South Wales, on the 16th.The Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) Amendment Bill was introduced into the House of Commons by the Minister of Labour on the 21st February and read the first time.The Unemployment Position.Statistics. The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in the United Kingdom on the 11th February was 358,691, of which 337,618 were lodged by men and 434 by women totally unemployed, and 20,591. by men and 48 by women working short time. On the 4th February there Were 352,074 policies lodged, of which 329,782 were lodged by men and 434 by women totally unemployed, and 21,804 by men and 54 by women working short time.On the 11th February in the United Kingdom 1,407,928 unemployment books remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Act, of which 416,366 were lodged by men and 3.15,328 by women totally unemployed, and 273,641 by men and 402,593 by women Working short time ; an increase on the previous week of 30,322 totally unemployed and 28,903 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 18th February was 1,169,400. The above are advance figures provided by the Employment Department, and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 210.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.Unemployment.Relief of Unemployment-A full statement with regard to the various measures which are being, or have been, put into operation for the relief of unemployment was made by the Minister in the course of the Debate on the Address in the House of Commons on the 16th February. The serious situation created by the fact that, in a large number of&apos; cases, the eight weeks period for receiving benefit under Section 44 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, had come to an end was relieved by the announcement that an amending Bill to extend the period would be immediately introduced.Developments have taken place with regard to the Government^ proposals for the admission of 50,000 ex-Service men into the building industry. The executive council of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers have this week decided to recommend members of the Federation to accede to the request of the Government that employers should take into the industry 50,000 ex-Service men, and to issue at once to their members a statement of the position. Members will also be requested to vote on the question of authorising the executive to carry out the Governments request.The Emergency Committee of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives have decided to summon a conference of the executives of all the affiliated unions to consider the whole question of dilution, and the proposal to introduce a sliding scale for the future* See below, p. 218.
Features of the Week-continued.regulation of wages in the industry. The recent decision of the employers&apos; federation will, of course, also be discussed. In this connection, it may be mentioned that a deputation representing the British Legion, an amalgamation of four ex-Service men&apos;s organisations  the Officers&apos; Association, the Comrades of the Great War, the National Association of Ex-Service Men, and the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers was received by the army committee of members of the House of Commons on the 21st February. It was represented to the committee that the organisations concerned would benefit greatly by the Government^ proposal to absorb 50,000 ex-Service men into the building industry, and subsequently it was agreed that several members of the committee should request an interview with the Prime Minister on the matter.Labour Policy. The adjourned joint delegate conference of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress will be held in London on the 23rd February, to decide upon the policy to be adopted in regard to unemployment. The Parliamentary Labour Party have carried out the instructions contained in a resolution passed by the previous conference on the 27th January, that the recommendations of the report of the Joint Sub-Committee on Unemployment should be circulated to all members of Parliament, and brought forward in the debate on the Address at the beginning of the new session. The results of this action are not regarded as satisfactory ; and the adjourned conference have, therefore, to decide what further steps shall be taken to compel the Government to accede to their demands. At the last conference, there was a strong tendency towards moderation, and the adoption of constitutional methods, and it is not probable that proposals for drastic action will at this stage meet with much favour. The executives of the trade unions represented at the last conference were instructed to take the opinion of their members as to future action. In a number of cases, notably in the case of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, this has been done, and delegates empowered to support whatever resolutions in favour of direct action may be advanced.On the 17th February, the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the National Executive of the Labour Party met, and adopted a long resolution condemning the policy of the Allies as expressed in the terms of the German indemnity proposals, partly on the ground that the proposals are inhuman and impossible of realisation, and partly because there is a strong belief that the existing unemployment crisis in Great Britain is principally due to the Allies&apos; foreign policy.The application to London of the Labour policy in regard to unemployment was discussed by delegates of organisations affiliated to the London Labour Party and Trades Council at a meeting held on the 19th February, at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street. Resolutions were passed re-affirming the official Labour policy as formulated in the Joint Committee&apos;s report, censuring London members of Parliament for neglect of their duty towards the unemployed, condemning their proposals to postpone the establishment of continuation schools under the London County Council, and urging that the Metropolitan local authorities should be enabled to proceed with important public works by a grant from the Exchequer of 90 per cent, of the cost of such works. A list of works which could be undertaken in this way was included in the resolution.Effect on Trade Unions. The great increase of unemployment throughout the South Wales coalfield has had an immediate effect on the funds of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, and it has been found necessary to hold a special delegate conference to consider the position. This conference was held at Cardiff on the 19th February, and it was decided that the employers should be asked to deduct at the colliery offices a levy of 6d. in respect of full members, and 3d. in respect of half-members, or boys, from the pay-ment for each shift. It was also resolved that, as the Government had refused to put into operation the unemployment policy of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress, measures should be taken forthwith to get the whole of the Labour movement to take drastic steps within 14 days to enforce this policy.Cotton Reconstruction Board. At a meeting of the Cotton Reconstruction Board in Manchester on the 15th February, it was decided to continue the payment of unemployment benefits* until the end of March. It was stated at this meeting that the Board had reason to believe that some spinning firms have varied their system of short-time working from that recommended by the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, presumably for the purpose of enabling their operatives to claim unemployment benefit. Such action was strongly deprecated, as the funds at the disposal of the Board are strictly limited, and it is desired to conserve them as far as possible.
19926.2.21.Features of the Week-continued. General Topics.Industrial Courts Act, 1919 ; Tramwaymeri&apos;s Court of Inquiry. After an adjournment of ten days, the Tramwaymen&apos;s Court of Inquiry was resumed on the 15th February at St. Ermins, Westminster. Returns were submitted from the municipal undertakings in accordance with the request of the chairman at the last sitting. * Evidence on the financial position of municipal tramway undertakings was given by Mr. J. Beckett, secretary of the Municipal Tramways Association; Alderman C. Higham, chairman of the Blackburn Cor-poration Tramways Committee; and Mr. W. D. Johnson, controller of the London County Council tramways. On the 16th, returns from the privately owned concerns were submitted. The first witness on this day was Mr. de Turckheim, secretary of the Light Railways and Tramways Association, and of the Conference ot Tramway and Light Railway Companies, who dealt with the financial position of the industry from the point of view of the private concerns. Evidence was also given for the companies by Mr. A. W. A. Chivers, inspecting officer to the British Electric Traction Federation, and Mr. J. C. Spencer, general manager of the London United Tramways Co., Ltd., and other companies in London. Mr. Spencer gave evidence on behalf of the South Metropolitan, North Metropolitan, and the London United Companies. At the sitting of the Court on the 17th February, Mr. E. Hatton, general manager of the Newcastle Municipal Tramways, was examined. Mr. J. B. Hamilton then addressed the Court on behalf of the municipal undertakings, and Mr. J. C. Spencer on behalf of the private concerns. The proceedings were concluded on the 18th February, when several witnesses were examined on behalf of the Scottish undertakings, and Mr. Bevin made his final speech on behalf of the men.Trade Boards Acts. A further defence of the Trade Boards is contained in the issue of the 19th February of the Shop Assistant, the official organ of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, in which it is pointed out that only a year ago the Drapers&apos; Chamber of Trade, at a special meeting, urged the establishment of a Textile Distributive Trade Board, whereas now the Chamber are advocating the Board&apos;s suspension. The same journal points out, moreover, that both the secretary of the Chamber and the secretary of the Incorporated Association of Retail Distributors admit the desirability of minimum wages being fixed in the event of the Trade Boards being suspended, the secretary of the latter body advocating that the minimum wage legislation demanded by the National Industrial Council of 1919 should be immediately passed through Parliament.A report has been issued by the committee appointed by the National Union of Manufacturers to collect evidence from trades affected by the Trade Boards Acts, in which it is suggested that the Acts should be suspended, and &quot; the whole system recon-sidered, and effect given only to the original idea of fixing a minimum wage that shall not be a starvation wage.&quot;Labour and Ireland. The special Labour campaign to promote peace with Ireland, which was inaugurated at Manchester on the 17th January, concluded on the 15th February with a meeting in London at the Albert Hall, which was addressed by several members of the Labour Commission who recently visited Ireland on a tour of investigation. Mr. George Lansbury presided, and the speakers were Messrs. Arthur Greenwood, A. G. Cameron and J. Bromley, and Miss Margaret Bondfield. A resolution was passed demanding a judicial inquiry into the question of reprisals, and that efforts should be made to settle the Irish question by the methods already suggested by the Labour Party.Mr. J. H. Thomas raised the question of the Mallow shootings in the House of Commons on the 15th February, and asked that an inquiry should be held. The Prime Minister promised that all the facts should be &quot; looked into most carefully.&quot; At a meeting of the executive committee of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, held on the 17th February, it was decided to cancel the strike instructions issued to the members, although the committee adhered to their original intention to press for an inquiry by the Government at which representatives of the unions affected should be present. The Court of Inquiry set up by the military authorities is still sitting, and legal representa-tives of the railway men are in attendance, but no reports have yet been issued.. .National Conference of Labour Women. A conference under the auspices of the Labour Party, with the co-operation of the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations is to be held in Manchester on the 27th and 28th April, under the chairman-ship of Miss Margaret Bondfield. .0n the first day, the subjects for discussion will be international policy, and unemployment; ,and a report will be presented on the organisa-
Features of the Week-continued.tion of women within the Labour Party. In addition to the subjects dealt with in the report, resolutions will be considered on the civic and political rights of women, including enfranchisement; the work of women magistrates and. women jurors; women&apos;s position as civil servants and mothers&apos; pensions. On the morning of the second day, the subject for discussion will be the standard of life, including health, housing and education, and, in the afternoon, there will be an open session, at which addresses will be given by Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., on &quot; The Labour Party and Ireland,&quot; and by Mr. F. 0. Roberts, M.P., on &quot; Taxation and the Home.&quot;Union of Post Office Workers. In a previous issue of this Report, reference was made to the reported decision of the Irish Postal Workers&apos; Union, formerly known as the Association of Irish Postal Clerks, to admit to membership Irish Post Office workers of all grades except supervisors.* This decision has caused friction with the Union of Post Office Workers, and the executive council have passed a resolution objecting to official recognition being extended to the new union, as representing classes hitherto regarded as members of the Union of Post Office Workers. With a view to adjusting the differences which have thus arisen, a special conference of the Irish branches of the union is to be held in Dublin on the 11th March, to discuss the future organisatiort of postal workers in Ireland. Resolu-tions from various branches are to be considered, most of which advocate a separate union for Ireland when self-government is established; but the opinion is put forward that, as long as Ireland remains under the control of the Imperial Parliament, the interests of Irish postal workers will best be served by their remaining in the Union of Post Office Workers as at present constituted. Another suggestion is that an Irish council, subordi-nate to the executive council of the Union of Post Office Workers, should be formed to deal with Irish affairs.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Engineers [Midlands). A conference was held on the 14th February between the Birmingham and Wolverhampton District Association of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations and the 15 unions affected by the proposed reduction of wages for youths and boys. No decision Was arrived at, and the conference Was adjourned until the 28th February.There have been a considerable number of instances of reductions in individual work-shops in the Midlands area. These reductions have been enforced usually without a conference with the unions, but district rates have not been affected. The Amalgamated Engineering Union, during the past week, have issued definite instructions in the Bir-mingham area that, in any case where an employer attempts to reduce wages below the recognised district rates, the men must cease work, but in cases where a proposed reduction does not affect the district rates, the question should be a matter for negotiation.Brass and Metal Mechanics (Birmingham). The Brassfounders&apos; Employers&apos; Associa-tion have given notice of the withdrawal of the&apos;12 J per cent, bonus to time-workers, and the 7j per cent, bonus to piece-workers, from the 1st March, to be followed a month later by a general reduction of 4s. a week. An advance of 4s. was conceded in May, 1920, as the result of a dispute consequent on the decision of the Industrial Court that the brassmakers&apos; claim to engineering trade advances under Award No. 180 had not been established.Foundry Workers (National). After a national ballot on payment by results, over-time and other matters, the executive of the National Union of Foundry Workers issued instructions that no overtime shall be worked, no new night-shifts shall be instituted, and the number of men on night-shifts shall not be increased, until an agreement is arrived at &quot;with the employers regarding overtime, night-shifts, and the application of standard rates of Wages at 21 years of age.It is understood that the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations are considering the matter, but that, while the question of a lock-out has been discussed, no definite action has been decided. There is evidence that the members of the union are not unanimous as to the efficacy of the embargo, but the executive have repeated their instructions and have threatened heavy fining. &apos;
Shipbuilders (National). A conference of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation was held at Edinburgh on the 18th February. The secretary of the Federation has ex-plained that this was one of a series of meetings for the purpose of reviewing the whole position of the industry, and that in all probability there would be a further meeting in two weeks&apos; time, when the constituent bodies had considered the position in their own districts. The workmen had been informed that the employers would not propose a reduction of wages at the present time if other methods of reducing the cost of production could be found ; failing this, however, a wages reduction was inevitable.Railway Shopmen (National). With reference to the demarcation dispute between the National Union of Railwaymen and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, which has already been dealt with at some length in this Report,* no official account has been issued of the result of the discussions which took place between the executive of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the representatives of the Federation of Engineering and Ship-building Trades on this subject at York, on the 9th and 10th February. According to Mr. John Hill, the joint conference unanimously agreed to seek an immediate consultation with the Negotiating Committee of Railway Managers for the settlement of the question. It is quite clear, however, that the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation have refused the offer of the National Union of Railwaymen to submit the difference relating to the negotiations for railway shopmen to arbitration.The executive of the National Union, on the other hand, have passed a resolution instructing the general secretary to approach the Ministry of Transport for an immediate meeting to negotiate on the railway shopmen&apos;s programme, to which all the unions whose members are affected should be invited, the negotiations not to be delayed in the event of any union failing to be represented. The position may be yet further exacerbated by the fact that the strike of railway shopmen employed on the Great Northern Railway was settled last week only on the understanding that the district engineering rate is to be the subject of immediate negotiations on a national basis.fOperative Bakers (Scotland). The national working agreement between the Scottish master and operative bakers terminates on the 1st March. The Scottish Union of Bakers and Confectioners have made application for the stabilisation of the existing wage rates for the next eight months, for 12 days&apos; annual holiday with pay, and for the abolition of female labour in bakeries. The withdrawal of the representatives of the Glasgow Master Bakers and Confectioners&apos; Association has resulted in the virtual suspension of the Joint Industrial Council,! through which the national working agreement had been arranged. The Scottish Master Bakers&apos; Association have decided to abandon the principle of a national agreement, and their executive committee, at their meeting in Edinburgh on the 16th February, resolved to recommend districts to endeavour to make local agreements with the operatives on the basis of a 48-hour Week ; a cost-of-living sliding scale of wages, involving a 3s. reduction for every 10 points fall in the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number; the continuation of the present arrangements with regard to holidays; and freedom with regard to the employment of female labour.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Engineers (Coventry). The Triumph Motor Co., Ltd., have notified all their day-work employees of the withdrawal of the 12^ per cent, voluntary bonus which the company claim that they have been paying in error since May, 1916. On the 1st February the company discharged their day-workers, and at the same time offered them re-engagement at the district rate plus all the customary additions except the 12J per cent, voluntary bonus. A considerable number of employees have refused to resume work on these terms, and the Amalgamated Engineering Union contend that no reduction should be enforced except after a general trade agreement, and that the firm, by discharging the men, have con-travened existing agreements between the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations and the union. They demand the reinstatement of the men at the old terms, pending the decision of the central conference. The finn, however, claim that they are acting within their rights, and that the men should work on the reduced rates, any decision of the central conference being made retrospective.The dispute was discussed at the central conference at York last week without any agreement being arrived at. The matter was further considered by the executive council of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Coventry officials of the union, in London, on the 19th February.  No report of their decision is to hand.* See ttis Report, Yol. Ill, No. 7, 12th February, p. 156, .   ..........f See also p. 202, below. ...       J See also p, 206,. below.
/* See this, Report, Vol. II, No. 25, 18th December, p.. 683.Settlements and Agreements.Spelter Workers (Swansea). The British Metals Extraction Co. have entered into an agreement with the Workers&apos; Union for an immediate reduction of 10 per cent, in the wages of the employees at the Villiers Spelter Works, Swansea, work to be guaranteed for three months, when the position will be again reviewed. The works in question are small, employing only 100 men. The five large spelter works in Swansea have been closed for several months, and the view of manufacturers is that the 10 per cent, reduction at the Villiers Works is a preliminary to a further &quot; cut &quot; in wages which would affect all the works when they are restarted.Railway Shopmen (Great Northern Railway). Railway shopmen and running-shed men, who are members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and are employed by the Great Northern Railway Company at Doncaster and various other repair centres, struck on the 13th December to enforce their demand that their wages should be brought up to the level of the district rate in engineering shops, with an additional 105. a week for shedmen.* Following the concessions made by the Great Western Railway and the London and North-Western Railway, and on representations made by the unions con-cerned, the Negotiating Committee of General Managers gave authority to railway com-panies to settle with their running-shed mechanics up to an advance of 6s. per week, partly on account of the dirty nature of the work. The Amalgamated Engineering Union at first refused to accept this offer. Later, discussion took place with the Ministry of Transport as to whether certain grades were employed in the running-sheds and, in some cases, whether they could be regarded as fully-skilled men, and the Great Northern Railway undertook to ascertain the position of similar men on other lines. As a result the men con-cerned resumed work on the 16th February at the old rates, except that running-shed men received the advance of 6s. a week. The settlement, however, was only accepted as provisional, pending negotiations on a national basis with regard to the district rates.Embossers, Finishers and Water ers (Gorton). An instance of a voluntary offer by wage-earners to reduce costs of production by accepting lower wages is reported in the case of the employees of Messrs. R. Williams &amp; Sons (Gorton), Ltd., Manchester, embossers and finishers, who agreed practically unanimously to make application for a reduction in wages by 10 per cent. The application Was accepted by the company, who are reducing the charges for finishing by the same percentage to any customers who guarantee to pass on this concession to their own customers. The employees are not members of any trade union.Co-operative Employees (Scotland). An award has been issued by Sheriff T. A. Fyfe, who is chairman of the Grocery and Provisions Trade Board, respecting the demands submitted, to the Scottish Co-operative Wages Board by the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers on behalf of their members who are employees of retail co-operative societies in Scotland. The award fixes rates of wages for the various grades of workers, generally speaking in advance of present scales, and provides for a 48-hour working week and 12 days&apos; annual holiday with pay, in addition to statutory and customary holidays.In his comments on the case, the arbitrator pointed out that wages in Scottish co-operative societies were below the level of those prevailing in the English societies. He expressed the opinion that Trade Board rates were unworthy of co-operative employment. The claim for a living wage at the present day should be regarded as involving, not the right to have merely a subsistence allowance, but the right to have life ordered upon a higher standard &quot; with regard to those comforts and decencies which are productive of better habits, &apos;give a chance for the development of a greater sense of self-respect, and betoken a higher regard for the place occupied by those workers in the scheme of citizenship.&quot; Sheriff Fyfe thought that these principles should be particularly applied to co-operative employment, where the relations between employers and employed are upon a higher level than in the ordinary commercial system.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Department Section of the Report, pages 203 to 208.]
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Boilermakers and Blacksmiths on Railways (Ireland). The Industrial Court held that the claim that the rates of boilermakers and blacksmiths in railway shops should be raised to the Belfast rates for such classes of workpeople had not been established, but decided that the basic rate of boilermakers employed in the Dublin railway shops should be in-creased by Is. 9d. per week, in order to restore the pre-war relation between the rates of fitters and boilermakers.  (Award No. 619.)Electrical Cable Making.--The Industrial Council met on the 16th February. The trade unions reported that no further conference had been held with the Independent Cable Makers&apos; Association since November of last year, and that up till now their efforts to bring the outside firms into line with members of the Cable Makers&apos; Association in the matter of rates of Wages had been unsuccessful. The chairman reported that he had been approached by two firms outside the Cable Makers&apos; Association on the question of admitting the Independent Cable Makers&apos; Association to the Council.&apos; He further reported that the British Insulated and Helsby Cables, Ltd., had decided to pay Council rates of wages to the workers engaged at their Prescot works. It was therefore decided to send out a circular letter to Government departments and municipalities giving the names of members of the Cable Makers&apos; Association, and of those firms outside the Association who are paying rates of wages as fixed by the Council. Further, the trade union side promised to bring to the attention of all Labour members of the municipal and county councils the agreed rates of wages for the industry. The joint recommendations of the committee on the question of supplying overalls, of wages for girls between the ages of 14 and 17 years, and of overtime rates for women, were accepted. These recommendations will be embodied in a formal agreement.Shipbuilders (National). Sir David Shackleton, on the 18th February, received a deputation from, the Federation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades, who, in view of the refusal of the employers to concede their claim for increased wages, urged that a Court of Inquiry should be set up. Mr. John Hill, on behalf of the deputation, expressed dis-appointment at the refusal of the shipbuilding employers to stabilise wages for six months, and stated that the unions believed that the employers would shortly propose a reduction of Wages varying from 10 per cent, to 25 per cent. The employers had refused their application for an increase in wages on grounds which the union was not in a position to verify. Sir David Shackleton explained that the policy of the department was to encourage industries to settle their difficulties, if possible, by negotiations conducted by themselves. If negotiations failed, then Part I of the Industrial Courts Act could be used. He would not use Part II until these other methods had been exhausted, and in that case it would be a matter for the Minister to decide the action to be taken from the point of view of the public interest, rather than that of either party. Mr. Hill stated that he did not think that the members of the unions or the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation would agree to arbitration, but if the Ministry, after consultation with the employers, thought it worth while to suggest arbitration to the unions, they would certainly consider the matter.WOODWORKING AND FURNISHING.Upholsterers (London).-In connection with a dispute as to the piece-rates for upholsterers employed by Messrs. Hart &amp; Sons, a conference Was held on the 14th February under the chairmanship of a Conciliation Officer. The employers proposed that new rates should be fixed on the basis of the piece-work rates prevailing in July, 1914, plus 20 per cent., &quot; without prejudice to further negotiations,&quot; plus 123 per cent. The trade union representative refused to accept the proviso that the first 20 per cent, advance should be considered &quot; without prejudice to further negotiations,&quot; which, in his opinion,
were bound to arise. The proposal was accordingly withdrawn, and the employers stated that they would only work upon the advance of 10 per cent, agreed to in 1917. The trade union representative agreed to place the matter before a meeting of his members, and the conference was accordingly adjourned.The Conciliation Officer formed the opinion that the upholsterers&apos; federation were using this case as a test case preparatory to a general reduction in piece-rates throughout the trade in East London. It is stated that several firms have already successfully reduced their rates.BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Building. The Safety and Welfare Committee of the Joint Industrial Council, on the 17th February, decided to approach the Joint Industrial Council for the Quarrying Industry, with the suggestion that they should jointly consider the desirability of bringing stone-masons affected by silicosis under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Silicosis) Act, 1918.The committee will also interview the Chief Inspector of Factories on the 17th March, with reference to putting into operation their recommendations concerning safety regula-tions for woodworking machinery.Building Trades Operatives (Bideford). Attempts to bring the parties in this dispute* together were unsuccessful, but later the operatives arranged to return to work on the 17th February, receiving an immediate increase of Id. and a further increase of \d. per hour as from the 1st March.Bricklayers&apos; Dispute (Bristol). On the 14th January the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society placed an embargo on a contract which was being executed by Messrs. Walter Jones &amp; Sons, Westminster, for the erection of a new factory at Fishponds, Bristol. The local operatives objected to the employment of London bricklayers and labourers, who, they thought, were sent in order to force the pace. The firm withdrew the London operatives, and the contract proceeded without further labourtrouble until the 14th January, when it was found that on the average only 30 bricks per man per hour had been laid. The firm discharged the local men. The bricklayers then secured the black-listing of the contract by their society. A Conciliation Officer arranged a conference on the 27th January, with the result that the embargo was removed. Work was resumed, and is now being carried on to the satisfaction of the employers.Building Trade Wages (Kirkwall).-Members of the local branch of the Scottish United Operative Masons&apos; Association, on the expiry of their wages agreement with the Kirkwall master builders on the 31st October, put forward claims for an immediate advance of id. per hour on their rate of Is. %d., a further advance of 4c?. per hour from the 1st February, travelling time and allowances, trade holidays and the recognition of the 44-hour week. The employers refused the claims on the ground that trade conditions warranted no change in wages.At the request of the operatives the department arranged a conference, at which, influenced by an increase of 3d. per hour in Wick, the operatives renewed their claims. The employers again refused, and it was agreed to refer the matter to arbitration. As the employers disagreed with the inclusion of the Orkney Islands in the terms of reference the matter was confined to Kirkwall. The employers&apos; association have now refused to sign the reference stating that they have decided to move no further in the matter. Though the majority vote of the operatives&apos; executive council is against a strike in Kirkwall at present, it is understood that local feeling will lead to early action to establish their claim.QUARRYING.Payment of Coal Miners&apos; Wages to Clay and Ganister Miners A meeting, at which the Ministry was represented, was held, on the 16th February, under the presidency of the Secretary for Mines, between the Clay Employers&apos; National Council and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. The meeting was brought about by a fairly widespread refusal on the part of the employers to pay clay-pit workers the 3s. 6cZ. recently granted to coal miners as a result of the strike settlement. The employers contend that, as that increase was.expressly given owing to the prosperity of the coal industry and the high price of export coal, it ought not to affect clay-mine owners, since these considerations do not apply. It became clear in the discussion that the practice varied very considerably in different districts; and it was agreed that the employers would forthwith meet district
Hosiery. The Industrial Council met at Leicester on the 15th February. The amended proposals for contracting out of the Unemployment Insurance Act were considered. The Council have now drafted clauses to define the scope of the scheme, and the classes of workers to be included therein. It was agreed that, as it was essential for the industry to make their calculations on a basis of 3 per cent, of unemployment, the scheme should provide the same benefit as the national scheme, with a reduced rate of contribution; and that further benefits should be provided when the scheme had run for two or three years and a reserve had accumulated.The employers submitted a proposal that the reduction in the rate of bonus on present basic wages from 125 per cent, to 100 per cent., consideration of which had been deferred until April as the result of a meeting of the Council in January last, should take effect as from the first pay-day in March. The employers advanced the arguments that the reduction would conduce to a revival of trade, and that, if the Council did not reach an agreement, individual manufacturers would secede from the employers&apos; organisations, and make arrangements independently of the Council. The operatives&apos; representatives ultimately agreed to call special meetings of the unions to notify their members of these arguments, and afterwards to take a ballot of the industry, the result of which will be communicated at a special meeting on the 10th March.Scottish Hosiery. The annual general meeting of the Industrial Council was held in Edinburgh on the 14th February. The business of the meeting was chiefly formal. There Was, however, some discussion as to the desirability of continuing the Council in ,view of the independent action of the West of Scotland Hosiery Manufacturers&apos; Association in, effecting a reduction of wages without consulting the Council. The meeting eventually agreed unanimously that the Council should continue.Wool Textile Industry (Bradford). The general conference of the directors of Messrs. Priestley, Ltd., Bradford, and the union&apos;s representatives on the 11th February* proved abortive. It was ultimately proposed that Sir William Priestley and the secretary of the National Association of Unions in the Textile Trade should endeavour to settle the dispute on the best possible terms. A tentative agreement was submitted to the workpeople, who accepted the terms by a majority. The terms provide for the works to be opened on the 22nd February; all operatives to work together without any interference on the question of membership in the trade union ; no collection of trade union contributions to take place inside the works. The firm are to send for operatives as required at the earliest opportunity, it being understood that when a weaver fells a piece, she will be instructed to &quot; play &quot; until all the other weavers have been given an opportunity to resume work ; but the firm shall have the right to determine whether six of the late operatives shall be employed by them.Lead Mining. The Lanarkshire Miners&apos; County Union are now taking a ballot of the strikers at Wanlockhead and Leadhills to decide whether they shall accept the proposed wages reduction of 25 per cent. Meantime the union have asked that the companies shall implement their offer to submit their accounts to an independent accountant,, IRON AND STEEL.Plate and Sheet.-r \iQ Welsh Plate and Sheet Joint Industrial Council met on the 14th February, when the employers asked the maintenance men not on the new sliding scale to revert to the position before June last year in the matter of bonuses. At that time half the special bonus of 50 per cent, was converted into basic rate. They are now paid the new basic rate, plus a scale, plus 25 per cent, special bonus. The employers want them to accept the old basic rate, plus a scale, plus 50 per cent, special bonus. The workers declined to accept the change, and the matter was referred to a sub-committee for furtherTEXTILES.MINING.consideration.* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 7, 12th February, p. 159.representatives of the miners, and that, as soon as the immediate difficulties had been removed, a further national conference would be called to arrange suitable wage-fixing machinery for the future. The Coal Controller explained that he had no statutory power under the Mining Industry Act, 1920, to give directions as to the wages of clay-pit workers, and that he was therefore not further concerned. The matter devolves therefore on the Ministry of Labour.
*FOOD AND DRINK.Scottish Baking. The employers&apos;representatives on the Industrial Council decided, on the 10th February, to abandon the principle of a national working agreement. The em-ployers&apos; association regard the Council as suspended, on the ground that the union have used it only for wages purposes ; that equal wages increases have been given in the smaller and in the larger districts; and that the operatives are divided as to the desirability of a national working agreement. The master bakers generally are in favour of a reduction of wages and an increase in the number of hours.*Bakers (South Wales).--The conferencef presided over by the Mayor was duly held. The matters at issue were deferred for a month in view of the recent formation of a Con-ciliation Board set up by the South Wales master bakers and operatives. A meeting of the Board is to be held at an early date.TRANSPORT.Road Transport (London). The union have agreed to delete the question of retro-spective payment from the terms of reference to arbitration, and the employers&apos; association have been asked for their concurrence in the terms of reference as amended.POTTERY AND RUBBER.Pottery Workers (Scotland).-As a protest against the proposed reduction of the bonus, about 150 pottery workers who were still in employment decided to-cease work on the 17th February. The directors of the Potters&apos; Federation, Ltd., have agreed to meet a deputation of their employees, and the Chief Conciliation Officer has arranged a joint conference for the 21st February.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Supply. The National Joint Board of Employers and Staff Members met on the 19th February. The resolutions passed at a conference of employers&apos; representatives on the National Joint Board, District Joint Boards, and District Interim Joint Committees, on the 7th January, to the effect that the National Joint Board should not deal with matter relating to the commercial and clerical staffs, were again considered. The Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association intimated that their national executive committee had passed resolutions upholding the existing constitution, and supporting the continued repre-sentation of the Electricity Supply commercial Association on the Board. The Elec-tricity Supply Commercial Association insisted on representation. It was ultimately agreed that the meeting be adjourned till the 5th March, when the staff side would submit definite proposals with a view to a solution of the difficulty.The National Joint Industrial Council met on the 18th February. On an application for membership from the National Union of Clerks, it was unanimously agreed that the members of this union were outside the scope of the Council.Gas.-An unauthorised strike of stokers, labourers and fitters employed by the Hoyland, Elsecar and Wentworth Co., took place on the 12th January. The company had successfully appealed to the Regional Joint Industrial Council against the position assigned to it in the Councils zoning and grading scheme, with the result that the wages paid under the original decision were reduced by 5d. a shift for stokers, and by \d. an hour for labourers and fitters. The representative of the National Union of General Workers not having notified the men of the decision of the Council, they refused to accept the notice of reduction. After intervention by the Chief Conciliation Officer, work was resumed on the 15th February at the amended rates of pay, on the understanding that an appeal Would be lodged by the men&apos;s union representative against the decision of the Council.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (Scotland).-!^ Joint Industrial Council met on the 15th February. Arrangements were made for deputa-tions from the Council to wait upon the Association of County Councils in Scotland and the Association of Education Authorities in Scotland, who have not joined the Council. A deputation will also wait upon the Conditions of Service Committee of the Glasgow Corporation, who have remained outside the Council. A special meeting of the Council is to be held in March with a view to amending the constitution to permit of the attend-ance of accredited deputies in the unavoidable absence of members.  It was decided to* See also p. 201, above.t See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 6, 5th. February, p. 133.
proceed at once with arrangements to convene conferences for setting up six Provincial Councils.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).  The Provincial Council for the West Riding of Yorkshire met on the 17th February. Recommendations of the Grading Committee were approved, relating to minimum, rates of pay appropriate to 23 classes of workmen employed by local authorities in Grades A, B, C and I). The withdrawal of several authorities from the Council was considered, but no action was taken. A deputation was appointed to wait upon the Halifax Corporation, with a view to inducing the authority to carry out the recommendations of the Council relating to wages.The difference between the Wolverhampton Corporation and the Amalgamated Society of Gas, Municipal and General Workers in regard to the adoption by the former of the recommendations of the West Midlands District Council for Local Authorities Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers, and the Midland District Council for the Waterworks Undertakings Industry, has been settled, the Corporation having resolved to adopt the recommendations referred to.The Provincial Council for the Eastern Counties met on the 17th February. Owing to the small attendance of employers&apos; representatives, consideration of the grading scheme Was adjourned, and it was decided to report the position to the National Council, request-ing them to convene a conference of representatives of the local authorities in the area, in order that the representation of these bodies might be put upon a more satisfactory basis.  The annual meeting Was also adjourned.Waterworks Undertakings. The District Council for the Home Counties Area, com-prising Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire and Hamp-shire, met on the 14th February. Weekly rates of wages for meter repairers, as recom-mended by the Grading Committee, Were approved, as follows : Meter repairers employed by undertakings in A areas, 64s.; in B areas, 69s.; in C areas, 76s.; and in D areas 79s. 6d. A motion submitted by the trade union side for the provision of free sick benefit for all employees was rejected by the employers&apos; representatives.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Trinity House: Lighthouse Keepers. The Workers&apos; Union have applied to the Ministry for arbitration on behalf of the lighthouse keepers employed by Trinity House, on the ground that the Whitley Council have been unable to come to an agreement on certain questions of remuneration, hours of work, and allowances. The Board of Trade and the Corporation of Trinity House, however, claim that the keepers, having accepted the Whitley Council, should act in accordance with the constitution, which provides that in the event of disagreement the claim should be referred by the Council to the Board of Trade, for submission to the Civil Service Arbitration Board or such other body as is agreed upon by the Board of Trade and the Council.War Department. An ordinary meeting of the Industrial Council was held on the 17th February. Among the matters discussed were the establishment of crews of War Department vessels ; the discharge of men in the inspection department, and their pos-sible absorption elsewhere ; and the position of foremen, storekeepers and similar grades under the Whitley scheme. The last question was referred to the Executive Sub-Committee, to consider and report to the next meeting of the Council.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Insurance. The strike of insurance officials in the service of the General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation continues. A. further meeting of non-manual workers was held at the Cannon Street Hotel on the 11th February, when it was resolved that, failing a satisfactory outcome of the present negotiations, the matter should be brought before Members of Parliament.The Guild of Insurance Officials have been informed by the department that, in view of the attitude of the employers, it is impracticable at present to proceed further with the formation of a Whitley Council.
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered the question of the variation of the minimum rates, together with the recommendations of the District Trade Committees on the Board&apos;s suggestions. The Board agreed to issue a Notice of Proposal to vary the general minimum time-rates for male and female workers j 21 years of age and over, and to refer to the District Trade Committees the question of fixing a guaranteed hourly minimum time-rate for piece-workers. The Board considered a report of the sub-committee on the revision of the anomalies in the general minimum piece-rates, and agreed that a Notice of Proposal be issued to vary the general minimum piece-rates in accordance with the report.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Co-operative Wholesale Society: Wages Negotiations. The department has invited the parties to a joint conference under the chairmanship of Sir David Shackleton, and have suggested the 2nd March as a convenient date.*Paint, Colour and Varnish.-The Industrial Council met on the 17th February. Overtime rates for day workers were agreed to. Generally, time-and-a-quarter is to be paid for the first two hours&apos; overtime, and time-and-a-half for the remainder ; time-and-a-half for Saturday afternoons, and double time for Sundays. The Council decided to have nothing further to do with the proposed Association of Joint Industrial Councils. An application from the National Union of Clerks for representation Was refused.Seed Crushing and Compound Cake Manufacture. The first meeting of the Industrial Council Was held on the 15th February, when the Parliamentary Secretary gave an inaugural address. Mr. J. W. Pearson, of the British Oil and Cake Mills, and Alderman W. Devenay of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union Were elected joint chairmen. The election of other officers was postponed until a meeting on the 8th March, together with the subjects of the formation of District Councils, and the consideration of rates of wages and standardisation of conditions.GENERAL.Protest against Industrial Court Awarcl-By Award No. 589 the Industrial Court granted an increase in wages of 4s. per Week to workpeople in the chemical trades, having regard inter alia to the &quot; unduly low rates which prevailed prior to the war.&quot;The Chemical Employers&apos; Federation addressed a letter of protest to the Industrial Court, and sent copies to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Labour, and the Press. In this letter the Federation observed : &quot; We greatly fear that inaccuracies and inconsistencies such as we have shown to exist in the present Award, when coupled with such complete disregard of the national situation as this Award evidences, will endanger very appreciably the existence of the Industrial Court and will certainly effectively preclude it from fulfilling the happy functions for which its sponsors hoped.&quot;While the department have always taken the line that they cannot in any way discuss the merits of an Award issued by an independent tribunal, it was felt that the public effect of action of this kind was such as to justify the department in pointing out to the chairman of the Federation, as a matter of public policy, the extreme inexpediency of a body of employers such as the Chemical Employers Federation making public protests of the kind indicated. The Minister accordingly saw the chairman and secretary of the Federation on the 10th February. No discussion took place on the merits of the Award.[Reference to. matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 196 to 202, 209, 210, 217 and 218.]
General Department-continued.The Board agreed to inform the Minister that they had no objection to the inclusion of the operations of fixing hooks or eyelets or buttons within the scope of the proposed Board for the retail distributive trade, but that they adhered to their opinion that the operations of fitting up repairs and fixing rubber soles and heels should be excluded.Button Making Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board, after consideration, deferred the question of proposing a reduction of the minimum rates at present in operation, the employers&apos; representatives stating that they would give notice of a definite motion. It was agreed to appoint a committee to consider the practicability of fixing piece-rates for workers employed on swing-turning lathes.The Board considered a report from their representatives who had attended a joint conference of representatives of Trade Boards for the metal trades, and unanimously agreed not to amalgamate with any other Trade Board.The Board considered draft definitions of the proposed Trade Boards for the drapery and women&apos;s and children&apos;s outfitting retail distributive trade, and also the men&apos;s and boys&apos; outfitting retail distributive trade. They agreed to recommend the Minister to amend the present definition of the Button Making Trade Board so as to exclude the carding of buttons or of button moulds, when incidental to the sale of the articles specified in these draft definitions, and carried on so as to form a common or interchangeable employment for the workers engaged in such sale.Dressmaking and womens lAghl Clothing Trade Board (England and Wales). At the request of the Training Department the Administrative Committee considered schemes of training for war widows in, the dressmaking trade, and agreed to report to the Board their approval of both schemes suggested by the Women&apos;s Branch of that department.A letter from the Ministry was considered, relating to a proposal by the Dressmaking and Women&apos;s Light Clothing Trade Board (Scotland) for the establishment of a Trade Board in Scotland to include the manufacturing sections of the dressmaking and women&apos;s light clothing trade and the men&apos;s shirt trade. The committee agreed that the sub-division of the two Trade Boards, as proposed by the Scottish Board, Was undesirable and would create difficulties greater than those existing under the present arrangement.The committee agreed to recommend the Board to vary the general minimum time-rates for female learners in the retail bespoke dressmaking trade, and to amend the definition of a female learner. The committee further recommended that general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates be fixed for certain classes of female workers, 18 years of age and over, employed in the retail bespoke dressmaking trade, such rates to depend on the age of the worker and on the length of her experience in the trade.Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (England and Wales).-The question of the applicability to a hat-band cutter of the minimum rates of wages for cutters having been referred to the Board by the Ministry, it was agreed to reply that, as hat-bands are trim-mings, hat-band cutting is not within the scope of the operations performed by a cutter as defined in the Board&apos;s Notice dated the 11th November.The Administrative Committee agreed to recommend co-operation with Juvenile Advisory Committees in all possible ways, and to invite the Juvenile Branch to submit suggestions of any practical means of co-operation. At the request of the Ministry the committee considered the position of Jialf-time learners with regard to the completion of their learnership period, and agreed to report to the Board that, in their opinion, a half-time learner should count towards the completion of the qualifying period of learnership, not merely the actual hours during which the learner has attended for work, but the total period from the commencement of employment in the trade.Jute Trade Board (Great Britain).-T!he Board considered a letter from the Association of Jute Spinners and Manufacturers, requesting the withdrawal of the jute trade from the operation of the Trade Boards Acts. It was agreed that the appointed members be requested to communicate to the Minister the arguments of the respective sides.The Board agreed to fix overtime rates for certain classes of male and female workers in accordance with their Notice of Proposal dated the 29th October, and to suggest to the Minister that such minimum rates should become effective as from the 21st March, 1921.After consideration of motions that the general minimum time-rates fixed by the Board and the general minimum piece-rates proposed at the last meeting be reduced by 25 per cent., the Board resolved to give Notice of Proposal to reduce all minimum rates in operation by 20 per cent, and that the current Notices of Proposal be withdrawn and
General Department-continued.re-issued ; that the rates as therein specified be reduced by 20 per cent.; and that the previous decision to fix general minimum piece-rates for female hessian weavers, calcu-lated on a basic rate of 50^., be rescinded, and that notice of proposal be given to fix such minimum rates as calculated on a basic rate of  Od.The Administrative Committee considered a memorandum submitted to them by the Juvenile Branch on co-operation between the Trade Board and Juvenile Advisory Committees, and resolved that, before taking any action, a special meeting of the com-mittee, to which a representative of each section of the Birmingham Juvenile Advisory Committee should be invited for consultation, should be held in Birmingham on the day preceding the meeting of the Board.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Linen and Cotton Handkerchief and Household Goods and Linen Piece Goods Trade Board (Great Britain). The Minister has made an Order dated the 10th February, con-firming the general minimum time-rates and overtime rates fixed for male workers, and has specified the 25th February as the date from which these rates shall be effective.The general minimum time-rates range from 4fd. to Is. 3d. per hour, according to the workers age, between 14 and 21 years of age and over.The overtime rates are, for the first two hours of overtime on any day except Sunday, time-and-a-quarter; after the first two hours, time-and-a-half; for all time worked on Sunday, double time ; for all hours worked in any week in excess of 48, time-and-a-quarter, except in so far as higher over-time rates are payable. For the purpose of these overtime rates the Board have declared the normal number of hours of work to be 48 in any week ; 9 on any week-day other than Saturday; and 4$ on Saturday.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on pages 199 and 213.]EMPLOYMENT AND INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies, and placings during the week ending the 11th February: 	Men.

There is, as yet, nothing to indicate that the growth of unemployment has been arrested. The most serious decline in industrial activity reported during the week is in the iron and steel industries. This decline is, unfortunately, not confined to any particular district, but is referred to in the reports from Scotland, Tees-side, Sheffield, Scunthorpe, Barrow-in-Fumess and the South Wales district. It would also appear to be adversely affecting the iron ore and ironstone mining industry, carried on in the Cleveland
district, where it is reported that 1,350 ironstone miners are idle, and also in Staffordshire, in Cumberland and in Northamptonshire. There is also decreased activity in coal mining, and a substantial amount of under-employment in this industry is evident in the North-Eastern and South Wales districts.Textiles and Clothing. The continued fall in the price of cotton is adversely affecting the lace trade, and until prices become more stable no improvement can be looked for. In the hosiery trade very few orders are being received, and workers are mainly engaged in making for stock. The future of the boot and shoe trade continues to look brighter, and inquiries and orders, although in small numbers, are still being received. The opinion is expressed in trade circles that a return to normal conditions may be looked for about the beginning of the summer, and that the improvement will be gradual up to that time. Under-employment is still abnormal in the woollen and worsted trades.There is no improvement to report in the cotton trade. Reports from important centres in the North-Western Division are very disturbing, and there is no doubt that thousands of operatives are suffering in consequence of the prolonged period of reduced earnings. Widely divergent views are held in trade circles as to the immediate prospects in this industry. Some are distinctly optimistic, while others forecast a prolonged period of restricted production. Many firms are finding it necessary to make still further drastic reductions in the number of working hours.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. The lull on the Clyde continues, and large numbers of men are being paid off as contracts finish. On the Tyne, Tees and Wear there is a considerable amount of intermittent employment, and dismissals are constantly taking place. Repair work has been fairly brisk during the past week, but unfortunately the work on hand will be completed shortly. On the Mersey, work in the shipyards is much disorganised as a result of the joiners&apos; strike, and there is little prospect of greater activity until the dispute is settled.Other Industries. Short-time working is extending rapidly in the gold and silver and the file-making trades. In the Metropolitan area there is no abatement of the serious unemployment. The principal industries affected are engineering, -leather, printing, furniture, and food products. As regards transport work, more activity is reported at the Surrey Commercial Docks, but elsewhere throughout the country this work is very quiet.The London (Central) Exchange for the Building Trades report that the scarcity of bricklayers and plasterers is still pronounced. The situation in respect of carpenters has, however, undergone a considerable change, and it is not easy at the moment to place carpenters in the London area. The improvement in the painting and decorating trade previously reported is maintained, with the result that the number of painters claiming unemployment insurance benefit is being considerably reduced.Labour Reductions.-At liford, the Motor Gear and Engineering Co., Ltd., have closed down. Gloucester report that 150 men will be discharged from the tinplate works of Messrs. Richard Thomas &amp; Co., Ltd., Lydney, and the works will be entirely closed down. At Bilston, John Thompson Motor Pressings, Ltd., have discharged 90 Workpeople, and at Glasgow the Empire Aluminium Co., Ltd., have discharged 200 workers.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation. Statistics again show increases in full-time unemployment and short-time working. The increased figures are spread throughout the divisions, with the exception of the South Midlands and Eastern Division, where the live register shows a slight fall.Local Reports. Depressing reports from the North-Western Division are still received. Unemployment and under-employrnent continue in all branches of the textile industry, and prospects of improvement are generally held to be remote. In several districts cotton mills are extending the time for which they cease work, and other mills previously unaffected are organising short time. It is stated, how-ever, that brighter conditions prevail in the Heywood district. A firm in the Nelson Exchange area, employing 600 women, intend to work five days a week instead of three, and at Newton Heath an employer has decided to work full time during the next fortnight.Depression in other women&apos;s industries in the division continues to be acute. Paper mills in the Darwen Exchange area are closing down entirely. The position in the whole-sale clothing trade at Wigan has, however, improved slightly; some tailoresses in Barrow have resumed work, and at Northwich workers in an underclothing factory are now on full time.
There is general and heavy unemployment in the Liverpool and Manchester districts. The applicants registered in industrial areas are generally unsuitable for domestic work. Oldham state that reelers, winders and weavers, totally unemployed, are in a better posi-tion than women working short time, since they can claim unemployment insurance benefit, relief from the Cotton Control Board, and payment from trade union funds.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division the severe depression in the woollen and cotton textile industries continues. Other industries, such as lace, hosiery, wholesale clothing, paper manufacture and boot making also remain depressed. Bradford report that the depression in the textile industries is reflected in all other industries and trades. Other important centres, such as Hebden Bridge, state there is no improvement in the cotton industry. At Morley the women&apos;s live register is nearly 4,000 ; at Nottingham it is nearly 10,000. The slight improvement in the making-up trade has not been well maintained. At Leeds the live register now stands at nearly 10,000, clothing machinists, tailoresses and woollen weavers being severely affected.At Sowerby Bridge there is much unemployment and short time amongst woollen and cotton operatives, worsted workers and carpet weavers. In Derby, as in Nottingham, the hosiery, lace and corset trades are depressed, and there is severe unemployment in the lace centres.The staple clothing industries in the South Midlands and Eastern Division continue to show severe depression. At Bedford Messrs. Peek Frean &amp; Co., Ltd., biscuit manu-facturers, are working short time, but have made few discharges. At Leicester nearly 6,000 current claims to unemployment insurance are being dealt with at the Exchange, and 5,000 short-time workers are being paid benefit at the factories. At Northampton there is no improvement in the general situation.No improvement is shown in the West Midlands Division. Engineering and the allied trades continue to show severe depression. Further increases in the live register are reported from Birmingham. Serious unemployment is reported from Sparkhill, West Bromwich, Selly Oak, Smethwick and Redditch. A slight improvement in the pottery trade is noted at Burslem and Hanley. At Longton, however, it is said that unemploy-ment in this industry is on the increase.London continues to show the largest unemployment figures, and there appears to be little improvement in the factory areas. At Bermondsey the live register is over 3,000, although there is stated to be a slight improvement in the situation. The live register has increased at the Borough Exchange, tin, leather, paper, and food workers are among the unemployed, both here and in Camberwell. In Canning Town, rubber workers, soap makers, sugar refiners and workers in wholesale clothing are affected. In Deptford the clothing industry is slightly less depressed, and tailoresses and dressmakers are returning to short-time work. At Leyton there is a slight revival in the wholesale clothing and French polishing trades. At Whitechapel the live register is still over 4,500, and in addition there are about 600 women on short-time.In the South-Western Division the clothing industries continue depressed, notably at Barnstaple, where glove and lace workers, tailoresses and collar machinists are affected. Collar and shirt workers are on short time at Bridgwater. At Bristol the live register is over 1,300, in addition to 3,000 short-time workers. Chocolate workers, boot operatives, clothing machinists, corset makers and paper makers are affected.Some unemployment in the tinplate and clothing industries is reported from Wales. At Llanelly, for example, there are nearly 600 unemployment insurance claims current. The position in the Northern Division remains unchanged.Depression continues in the main industries in the Scotland Division. Clydebank report that the Singer Manufacturing Co., Ltd., are working short time, which affects trade throughout the area. At Dumfries there is serious shortage of work in the mills. At Dunfermline only two factories in the linen industry are on full time. At Galashiels unemployment in the woollen textile mills is on the increase. From Glasgow abnormal unemployment is reported in practically all trades ; at the Elgin Street Exchange there are 1,300 claims current.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Unemployment Situation. A large number of resolutions have been received on various points arising out of the unemployment situation. A matter which is attracting attention is the practice of workpeople in employment taking on other work in their spare time. The Holloway and Mansfield Committees draw attention to such part-time workers as theatre and cinema attendants, and press the Minister to urge upon all employers and
National Scheme. Up to and including the 16th February, 24,210 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 269,275 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller for the West Midlands Divisions states that the reports from the Employment Exchanges in his area indicate that the prevailing trade depression is responsible for a substantial increase in the number of disabled men on the registers. The increase, however, is very much smaller relatively than that of the ordinary register.Domestic Service. A standard has been suggested by the Romford Juvenile Advisory Committee for resident domestic service. A timetable has been drawn up allotting 8j hours for actual duty, 6f for meals and recreation, and 9 hours for sleep. The scale of wages recommended for girls entering domestic service at 14 rises from  18 4s. per annum at that age to  26 at the age of 18, after 4 years&apos; experience. The committee consider uniform to be essential, and suggest that employers should, where necessary, make an&apos;advance for its purchase. Employers are urged to encourage their maids to take advantage of any suitable educational and social facilities in the district.Tailoring. In a report presented to the Oxford Juvenile Employment Sub-Committee it was stated that, although there are approximately 400 journeymen tailors in the locality, very few juveniles are employed. The views of the secretary of the local branch of the tailors&apos; union were quoted to the effect that the journeymen, most of whom are outworkers, are quite unable to pay the Trade Board rate to learners. He did not think that these rates were too high, but considered that the employer, and not the journeyman, should be responsible for the payment of apprentices. Other opinions quoted were that apprentices are not at present given proper facilities for learning more than one branch of the trade, and that the employment of learners in the homes of journeymen is not satisfactory. The committee felt that in order to prevent a serious shortage of skilled workers, immediate steps should be taken to attract boys and girls, and to provide adequate training. It was accordingly decided to call a conference of trade organisations to discuss the position. 731.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.JUVENILE  BRANCH.trade unions the need for leaving such occupations for unemployed persons. The London Building Trades Committee are of the opinion that the restrictions on luxury building should be withdrawn. The Wrexham Committee, draw attention to the fact that the miners in the North Wales coalfields are, working overtime while there are many miners unemployed. With regard to the regulation that preference should be given to ex-Service men in connection with arterial roads and other relief works, the Lancaster Committee consider that unemployed civilians who are married and have dependants should receive consideration.  The same view is expressed by one of the Glasgow Committees.Circulation of Resolutions. A large number of resolutions have been received recently with requests for circulation. Many of these cover the same ground as resolutions already circulated, and every opportunity, is being taken of requesting committees in suitable cases to reconsider the question of circulation.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 10th February, show 241,361 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  222,648 15,?. Id.Unemployment Insurance. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 4th February was 799,021, involving an amount of  423,098 16s. lid.Unemployment Fund. The balance standing to the credit of the Fund on the 29th January, 1921, was  23,103,540. During the period from the 26th December, 1920, to the 29th January, 1921,  200,000 was transferred to the National Debt Commissioners for investment, making the total sum transferred  22,725,000.Advances to Workpeople. The number of advances made in December, 1920, was 4,751, divided into 488 recoverable advances, and 4,263 non-recoverable advances. The total amount of recoverable advances was  476, compared with a total for November of
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 11th February the Appointments Department placed 433 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 50,048. Of these, 6,768 have been placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 848 ex-Service men and 39 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 11th February was 11,005 ex-Service men and 1,424 civilians. At the same date, 930 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 436 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme.-During the week ending the 11th February the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 36 officers and men of similar educational qualifications, of which 25 were for training I of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,192 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 49,611 for training I of the type provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt with 27,771 applications, of which 23,277 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 22,153 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,331 cases.Business Training Scheme.-During the week ending the 11th February the Appoint- appointments Department received 111 applications for training under this scheme, bringing ithe total number of applications to 2,274 of which 556 have since been cancelled.  Grants have been sanctioned in 465 cases. At the same date, 303 training vacancies were at the I disposal of the department, 63 having been registered during the week.Training&apos; of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Department have dealt with a total of 1,070 cases, in 473 of which the training sanctioned is provided   1 by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments.   1 Candidates accented by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 283 cases, and   I abandoned training in 46; 127 are still in training and 87 are awaiting training.Employment and Insurance Department-continued.Secondary Schools (Wales). In this division the sympathy and support of the heads of the schools has been secured, with very few exceptions, and the scholars from these schools are dealt with at certain Central Exchanges, where they have the benefit of the advice of the Juvenile Employment Committees. At Newport school-leaving cards from all but one of the secondary schools, have been forwarded to the committee. Both at Swansea and Newport, representatives of secondary schools serve on the committees. At Cardiff applications for advice and assistance have been received by the committee from 117 boys and girls from secondary schools since the end of the summer term, and 61 have been placed in employment.Courts of Referees. A large number of committees are making use of their powers to send a representative to the Court of Referees when the claims of juveniles are being heard. The West Ham Committee report a case where the special information given by a representative of the committee was instrumental in securing a favourable decision. The same committee have forwarded a request that their representatives should be made full members of the Court.  The difficulty of doing this has been pointed out.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 197, 198, 205, 209, 210, and 216 to 218.]
TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 15th February, 25,134 men were in training, as against 25,135 on the 8th February, and 25,069 on the 18th January. During the week 417 men were placed in training. There were 16,145 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 8th February and the 18th January being 16,157 and 16,145 respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 25,972, the totals for the 8th February and the 18th January being 25,554 and 24,144 respectively.The number of men in Government Instructional Factories has now exceeded 10,000. The actual figure on the 12th February was 10,032 ; at the corresponding date last year it was 2,338 only. The opening of a number of new factories in the latter part of 1920 has helped materially to clear the waiting lists, and has also facilitated transfer from technical schools to the generally more satisfactory conditions of the Government Instructional * Factories.On the 28th December, the latest date for which full figures are available, there were 9,112 men in instructional factories, and 5,324 places equipped but not occupied. Of the places not occupied a large proportion are for various classes of training in the building, engineering and furniture trades, the three great branches of industry into which, in the majority of the divisions, admission is now not allowed, or restricted severely.Improver ship Vacancies. Somewhat exceptionally, when compared with the general experience, the authorities at Sarisbury Court seem to have had little difficulty in placing men out as improvers in the building trades. A number of men who have completed their factory training as bricklayers, plasterers and carpenters have recently been placed with employers, and highly complimentary reports have been received upon their work and conduct.As regards improvership vacancies generally, the position shows but little sign of improvement, and the department have under consideration what course of action shall he taken when the special Treasury sanction for emergency extensions expires at the end of next month.The Daily Mail Efficiency Exhibition has already made some contribution towards the solution of the general problem. A number of employers have applied for detailed information of the training schemes, and the majority appear to be sympathetically inclined to the idea of finding places for partially trained men in their factories. All such inquiries are being followed up by an officer from headquarters, and there is good prospect of results. During the first week definite inquiries, which should result in the placing of some 60 men, have been made, and in addition a number of employers have applied for permission to visit the instructional factories. There have also been a fair number of cash sales, and besides orders by private individuals, negotiations for a number of business orders, some on a considerable scale, have been started.Elementary Teachers.&apos; Five training college schemes for manual instructors have now received the approval of the Board of Education- The Sarisbury Court scheme which was launched last autumn has had a successful career, and the Springfield College, Birmingham, will be opened as soon as the constructional work in progress is completed. The remaining schemes are for the establishment of colleges at Erith, Hornsey and Gretna, where suitable accommodation has already been secured. The Gretna scheme is in substitution for the Birtley scheme which has already received Treasury sanction, and the Erith estimates are to be submitted at an early date.Government Instructional Factories. At Birtley the manager has undertaken a contract for H.M. Office of Works for the adaptation and renovation of buildings for use as Customs and Excise Offices.At the High Road Government Instructional Factory, Tottenham, a contract has been undertaken for the supply of 100 uniforms for the attendants at the Napsbury Mental Hospital.The men training in the electrical classes at the Hackney Marshes Factory, who were entrusted with the whole of the installation and wiring work for lighting and power for the department^ display in the Annexe at the Daily Mail Efficiency Exhibition at Olympia, have carried out their work in a most efficient manner. So long as the exhibition remains open the factory is providing a breakdown gang, for service in any emergency in connection with the lighting and power.
Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 16th February, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 45,744 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanc-tioned in respect of 43,715 apprentices, employed by 17,394 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 18,830.Wages. Difficulty is again reported to have arisen as a result of increases in journey-men^ rates during the course of renewed apprenticeships. The obligation under the scheme is to pay the required proportions of the prescribed rates prevailing from time to time, and, where these have been increasing rapidly, objections have been raised by employers. The present trouble has arisen at Eastbourne, but is said to be limited to a few non-federated firms. In the South-Western area difficulties are arising in cases where firms have re-engaged apprentices at the rates required by the scheme, but without bringing them under it or claiming the State grant. In most of these cases, owing to the growing . depression in industry, the firms find themselves unable to continue to pay the apprentices in excess of their actual earning capacity, without the assistance of the State grant, and fear that, if unable to obtain it, they will have to discharge them. The difficulty is in-creased by the fact that their applications were not received until several months after the closing date.Unemployment. Evidence continues to accumulate of the effects of trade depression upon apprentices under the scheme. A steady stream of suspensions is reported from the London area, and local headquarters have almost daily visits from men who are affected. In the South Midlands and Eastern area, the printing industry is reported to be experiencing very severe depression, but so far there has been no clear evidence that apprentices are appreciably affected. At Bristol, a satisfactory settlement has been reached in the case of three apprentice woodworkers who were suspended. Two have been reinstated through the efforts of local headquarters, and the transfer of the other has been arranged.Institutional Training. It has been found impossible to provide institutional training at Coventry for apprentices suspended by the Daimler Co., Ltd. The company are unable to lend plant and accommodation to the education authority for a class ; and, though it might be possible to secure accommodation from smaller firms, the trade union secretary objects strongly to this course, and refuses to sanction any arrangement to relieve the company of their responsibility for teaching the men. Relations between local employers and operatives in the engineering industry appear to be strained, and the men are apprehen-sive of a concerted effort by the employers to take advantage of existing unemployment to reduce wages. Reports from other areas are satisfactory. At Leeds, 20 vacancies for engineering apprentices are available at once, and it will be possible to provide for all applicants who are immediately eligible for institutional training. Others, apparently, are not yet eligible, as being under 21, but local headquarters expect to be able to provide for them, as they reach that age. In London, hopes are entertained of providing courses for considerable numbers. Sufficient students have now been secured for the second special engineering class at Paisley, and arrangements are being completed. It will probably start with 20 to 25 apprentices.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. Good progress is reported in connection with the national scheme in the Yorkshire and East Midlands area. Joint conferences have been held at Leeds, Bradford, Dewsbury and Mansfield. The first three referred the matter to their associations, with a view to the formation of local committees. The Mansfield conference passed a unanimous resolution in favour of the scheme ; and the chairman, who is mayor of the town and an engineer, expressed the view that other industries, including the engineering industry, might with advantage consider similar schemes. In this area the scheme is sometimes regarded in its connection with the development of technical training. The view that it would assist this development was expressed at Keighley at a recent joint conference, and at Doncaster it was held that great good would result, if a suitable syllabus of technical training could also be provided.Difficulties are still being experienced at Birmingham. There is considerable inertia among employers at Cannock and Hednesford, as well as at Shrewsbury, where the scheme could not he considered at a recent meeting from lack of a quorum. In Cannock and other mining districts, such as Rugeley and Tamworth, neither side are favourable to the
APPENDIX.QUESTIONS  IN PARLIAMENT.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Hours of Employment (Regulation).Mr. Barnes asked the Minister of Labour when it is intended to give effect to the Government commitments in regard to the eight-hours&apos; convention adopted at Washington. Conference in December, 1919.Dr, Macnamara: Negotiations with representatives of employers and trade unions are still in progress with a view to securing agreement as to the terms of the proposed Bill for the Regulation of Hours of Employment, and I hope to be able to make a statement on the matter at an early date. (nth February.)Minimum Rate of Wages Commission Bill.Mr. J. Davison asked the Minister of Labour if it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the Minimum Wage Commission Bill this Session; and, if so, when it is proposed to take the Second Reading of this Bill.Dr. Macnamara: I fear that the heavy demands upon Parliamentary time, which the legislative programme of the Session will entail, will make it impossible to proceed with the Minimum Rate of Wages Commission Bill during the present Session. (11th February.)Ex-Service Men.Mr. Swan asked the Minister of Labour the number of unemployed ex-Service men on the registers of the unemployment exchanges on the last available date.Dr. Macnamara: The number of ex-Service men on the live registers of the employment exchanges at the 11th February was about 368,000. (nth February.)DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT.King&apos;s Speech.In the debate on the Address, on the 16th February, Mr. Clynes moved an amendment regretting that, in view of the serious distress consequent upon unemployment and the lack of preparedness on the part of the Government, &quot; there is no mention of legislationscheme. The feeling prevails that the coal pits offer wages for juveniles with which the industry cannot compete. A hitch has occurred in the administration of the scheme at Hereford. As a result apparently of misunderstandings or disputed interpretations, employers seem unwilling to proceed with it, and the completion of a number of indentures is being delayed.There is every prospect of a speedy establishment of a local apprenticeship committee at Manchester, where the associations concerned have been invited to appoint one member from each side for every trade in the industry. It is hoped to hold an inaugural meeting early in March. At Gloucester, however, the prospects of the adoption of the scheme are not bright, owing to the apathy, rather than the actual opposition, of many employers. In Scotland, the consideration of the detailed application of the scheme by the Scottish regional Education Committee is proceeding slowly, and there are difficulties in agreeing upon the terms of an indenture.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 209 and 213.]
26.2.21,218Appendix- continued.recognising the right of the genuine unemployed to work or adequate maintenance.&quot; Speaking in the course of the debate, the Minister of Labour challenged the charge of lack of preparation on the part of the Government. In August, when &quot; the barometer was still high,&quot; the Cabinet appointed a committee to consider the question of unemployment and to devise plans. The relief schemes promoted by the Government, the alternative work provided in Government establishments and factories, and the short time instituted in these establishments, had found employment for 70,000 workers.As regards the building trades, the Minister dealt with the arguments of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives against the admission of additional operatives. Of 64,000 building trades operatives unemployed on the 3rd February, half were labourers, and over 25,000 were painters, members of a seasonal trade. The number included only 238 bricklayers, and there were at the time 5,576 vacancies for bricklayers registered at the Exchanges. The only two trades in which there were more vacancies than applicants were those of bricklayers and plasterers. On the 147,000 dwelling-houses under local authorities&apos; housing schemes for which contracts had been signed, there was a shortage of 11,300 skilled men. It was&apos;&apos; classic hardihood&apos;&apos; for the operatives to adjure the Govern-ment to &quot; push forward and fulfil its promised housing programme.&quot; The Government intended to do all that was humanly possible to fulfil their pledges to the ex-Service men.The Minister also outlined the proposals, foreshadowed in the King&apos;s Speech, for extending the provision made for the unemployed under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. It was proposed to increase the benefits under the Act to 18s. for men, 15s. for women, 9s. for boys and 7s. Qd. for girls. Contributions would not be increased until after the 3rd July, when the combined contribution of the employer and the employed person would be raised to lid. in the case of men, and the State grant to 2fd!. Benefit would be payable for 26 weeks in the year as against 15 at present. In addition, temporary provision was to be made to cover the period to the end of June, 1922. During this period, 32 weeks&apos; benefit would be payable, 16 weeks in the period from the passing of the proposed Bill to the end of October, 1921, and a further period of 16 weeks in the period from the end of October, 1921, to the end of June, 1922. The qualification would be proof of employment in not less than 20 weeks since the beginning of January, 1920. Ex-Service men now receiving out-of-work donation at the rate of 20s. would be brought within the proposed Bill, but would receive 20s. instead of 18s., the extra 2s. being provided by the Exchequer, and would qualify with 10 weeks&apos; employment since the 1st January, 1920, instead of 20. In the case of disabled men, the Local Employment Committees would be given power to grant the benefit even if the 10 weeks&apos; employment qualification could not be fulfilled. The rights of ex-Service men who had not exhausted their original policies, to receive donation at the rate of 29s. for the first six months, remained unim-paired. At the end of the emergency period, the position would be reviewed in the light of the prevalent unemployment, and the state of the Unemployment Fund.
