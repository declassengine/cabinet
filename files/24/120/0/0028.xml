OCXS 330CUME5T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITATOO MAJT!STY&apos;S GOVF7B$MT) .secret.cab I r: s t.3cp, 2628.mbsrcctcv organisation of supply amptransport &quot;Cfelttef * Memorandum by Sir Fric Qeddes.With reference to my memorandum CP. S432 which was considered at the Cabinet conference held on 10th January,l92l, I desire tc   invite attention to two further questions (A) and (b) which arose at the last meeting of the Supply and Transport committee on 18th February, 1921*   As a matter that may possibly be of general interest, I append also a note (c) for information.A.   SUPPLY DEPARTTOrt.It will be remembered that this organisation is responsi-ble for the local recruitment of volunteer labour in England and Wales, which is entrusted to local committees acting under the supervision of eleven civil Commissioners, jir. Kellaway being the Chief Civil Commissioner with London head-quarters known as the supply Department.Mr. Kellaway drew attention to the fact that the Con* elusions of the Conference on loth January last do not speci-fically authorise the continuance of the Supply Department.Those conclusions, however, recora (although not as a formal decision) a general agreement that the Stpply and Transport organisation should continue; and, as an earnest of this agreement, additional expenditure of 55,000 a year for an extension   of the emergency wireless scheme was formally authorised.   Furthermore&apos;, the memorandum before the Conference included an estimate of  ljOOO for normal yearly expenditure of the Supply Department, and no objection was raised to this item.   lily Committee were therefore of opinion that it was implicitly clear that the Cabinet desired the- 1 -
the Supply Department to be maintained, and therefore agreed -(1) that the Supply Department should be authorised to continue in existence,(2) that the Cabinet should be informed that such authority had been given.JBllTOURB Ev^ROEHOY OEGAllISiAlOU Ai (DO COAL.The   ines Department have Informed the Committee that the impending decontrol of the coal industry will sweep away their existing machinery for meeting a coal, railway and/or transport strike, but as adequate powers are secured under the Emergency Powers Act. it was suggested that the headquarters scheme be kept in being, so that it could be worked by volunteers at short notice: local schemes to be entrusted to various organisations of the traue, supported in emergency by volunteers supplied from headquarters.   T&amp;is proposed skeleton arrangement would in*i Lve a normal &quot;peace-time&quot; expenditure by the Mines Department of   ,000 a year to be met from the Emergency Vote.I am informed that during &quot;peace-time11 no corresponding expenditure will be incurred by other Departments oonoerned in the &quot;Skeleton&quot; ooal scheme.,In view of the Cabinet Conclusions referred to above, my Committee were of opinion that some organisation should essentially be maintained   for dealing&apos;v/ith coal.   The proposals of the llines Department seemed to indicate the most&apos;practical measures to be taken in the circumstances.The Committee therefore agreed(i) that dot&amp;ority should be given to the Mines Department and Ooal Sub-Comuittee for keeping in existence the skeleton coal scheme as suggested in their memorandum^(ii) that it should be reported to the Cabinet.  that such authority; had been given and approval should &quot;be sought for the exp expenditure inv olyecU- 2 -
I accordingly submit the matter for Cabinet authority for a normal expenditure at the estimated rate of  8,000 a year, to be incurred by the Mines Department in respect of the scheme in question, and borne on the Emergency Vote.XSLflBAKSPOBg &amp; STORES KBgiXffig.PROM DISPOSAL.It will be Remembered that Under Conclusion 2 of the Cabinet Conference held on 2nd Pebitery 1920, arid subsequent authorities;iotor Transport and Stores such as be&amp;dj&amp;g^ orookery etCe to a total &quot;value of nearly  500,000 were retained from disposal as a reserve of equipment to meet various emergency requirements.  My oolleaguee will be interested to learn that, partly by revision of arrangements ard partly by virtue of powers secured by the Emergency Powers Act, my Committee have now found It possible to dispense with the whole   of these stores and vehicles, except for 18 workshop motor-lorries and 8 trailers (of which the present value probably does not exceed  25.,000) retained for the food organisation because they are believed to be irreplaceable from ordinary sources.  The balance   of the equipment Is accordingly being thrown up for disposal.  Alternatively (but only in a few cases) certain items may be purchased as Departmental property, by the present holders, subject to usual Treasury procedure; but by far the greater proportion will be returned to the Disposal Board for sale., (Sd.)
