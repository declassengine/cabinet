SUMMARY.GENERAL.The feature of the month has been a marked swing to the Right in Western luirope, and following upon it a more determined effort on the part of Governments to grapple with revolutionary organizations.PRANCE.A raid by the French police on January 30th brought about the arrest, on a technical charge of possessing false passports, of a number of Russians, Serbs, and Czecho-Slovaks, all active Communists. Tho authorities believe that in one Abramovitch they have taken the local head of an International Communist organisation, working under tho direct orders of the Moscow International and financed by the Soviet to establish a strong French Communist Party.Infiltration of Communist members into the principal Trade Unions continues.BELGIUM.The industrial situation shows no improvement. Unemployment continues to spread and works to close.The split in the Labour Party lias led to the appearance of three elements the &quot;Parti Ouvrier&quot; or Labour Party proper, consisting of orthodox Socialists; &quot; La Federation Bruxelloise,&quot; with branches called &quot;LesAinis de 1&apos;Exploite,&quot; composed of advanced Socialists; and the &quot; Parti Commimiste Beige,&quot; led by W. van. Overstraeten.ITALY.The danger of violent revolution appears to have passed. At the Leghorn Socialist Conference on January 15th the result of the voting revealed the anticipated schism. 98,026 voted for the Unitari, or Right Socialists ; 14,685 for ihe Centristi, or United Communists ; and 58,783 for the &quot;Communisti puri.&quot; The latter have now formed an Italian Communist Party entirely independent of the Socialists.The attitude of the Vatican to Sinn Fein would appear to be non-committal. It recently issued invitations to a Conference to be held at Fribourg on the Irish situation. At this Conference the Papal Nuncio was to preside and several Irish prelates from the Irish College at Rome were to attend. Papal intervention in favour of Sinn Fein is unlikely, but it is possible that further Sinn Fein Conferences may be held in Rome.SPAIN.The National Confederation of Labour has broken with the Socialist Party and General Workers&apos; Union.In Barcelona the authorities appear to have gained a decisive, if temporary, victory over the extremists, who, for revolutionary purposes, have been engineering strikes without the general approval of the workmen. Drastic action by the authorities led many syndicalists to hand in their affiliation cards.Moscow has appealed to the workmen of all countries, to all organisations adhering to the Communist International, and especially to the Spanish &quot;Comrades,&quot; to refuse to touch Spanish goods or use Spanish materials.a 2
The situation remains uncomfortable, if not precarious. The exchange continues to fall and prices to rise. There have been food riots in the country and discontent in the towns. Inner circles of the Confederacao Geral de Trabalho are reported to be much divided. A new extreme Left Party, &quot; 0 Partido Communista Social,&quot; will be formed.NORWAY.Taught by the failure of the recent railway strike, the loaders of the Norwegian Labour Party have adopted a programme including the gradual exclusion of anti-Moscow Socialists and the formation of a purged and trustworthy revolutionary bloc. They have arrived at a secret agreement with the Soviet authorities, pledging themselves to carry out all orders delivered from Moscow.SWEDEN.The section of Left Socialists who decline to swallow Lenin&apos;s potion without some modification of its ingredients has defined its position. It claims freedom of opinion and rejects a Russian dictatorship.Strom and Hellberg have now legalised their position and put an official diplomatic cloak over their activities, Strom as Consul for Russia and Hellberg as commercial attache.DENMARK.The Communist Party has lately been active, aud, in Danish ports, successful. The Danish Syndicalist Party still adheres to the Geneva International, despite Moscow&apos;s efforts to rally it to the Third.HOLLAND.Dutch Communists grow more dispirited at the emptiuess of the revolutionary prospects.Troelstra is being helped by the Belgian Actionists.GERMANY.Dearth of funds from Russia is making the financial situation of the Communist Party precarious. Independent revolutionary action on its part is unlikely, but against any Right Putsch there would be a general union of Communists, Socialists, and Labour elements.It is reported that Moscow has ordered the German Communist Party and United Communist Party to strike a decisive blow this winter after a general strike which is to develop into an armed revolt. The Communist Labour Party is said to agree to the proposals of Moscow, but to doubt the willingness of the Communist Party and of the United Communists.Trotsky is reported to have recommended that everything must be done to avoid a break with Germany, as the country whose relations with Soviet Russia are correct, and whose importance as a purveyor of arms and munitions must be considered.Victor Kopp alleges that his status as trade representative of the Soviet Republic has been recognised by the German Government.
99SWITZERLAND.An International Conference of Socialist parties held at Borne during December decided to ask the proletarians of the world to form an all-inclusive Socialist International, and denounced the Communist Inter-national as &quot; deliberately working to shatter all Socialist parties which &quot; do not unresistingly submit to its dictation.&quot;The ballot of the executive of the Swiss Socialist Party upon the acceptance or rejection of Leuiu&apos;s 21 points has ended in their rejection by 44 sections of the party.AUSTRIA.Events during the month have bceu symptomatic of the general deliquescence of government and society in Austria. Reports have multiplied that tho Government was at the end of its resources.The Congress of the &quot; Two and a Half International&quot; to be held in Vienna next month will seek to mediate between the Second and the Third.CZECHOSLOVAKIA,Though it is uncertain whether the goodwill of the Czecho-Slovaks will succeed in staving off indefinitely a conflict with the Magyars, tho foreign situation in the country is reported favourable and no conilict even with Hungary is believed to be imminent.RUSSIA.The re-organisation and demobilisation of the Red Army is the main question now engaging the attention of the Soviet Government. At a series of Military Councils at Moscow in December, Trotsky, reporting on the position of the Army with refereuce to the internal and external situation of Soviet Russia, stated that the internal situation and especially the economic position of the country wore so bad that the Soviet Govern-nient might see itself obliged to start another war. He recommended that the conclusion of peace with Poland should be delayed ; that there should be no relaxation of Bolshevik propaganda in Poland or in the Polish army; that, propaganda must Imj continued in the East and in the Caucasus and increased in Roumanta ; and that while Lithuania and Georgia must serve as exercise grounds for the Bolshevik armies, the line of the Dniester must be consolidated. After violent discussions Trotsky&apos;s plans were approved.The recent eighth all-Russian Congress of Soviets is reported to have been distinguished by a marked divergence of views between the Right Communists headed by Lenin and the Left Communists headed by Zinoviett&apos; and Bucharin. There has been much debate between the party favouring and the party opposing the granting of concessions to foreign capitalists. These differences are the less likely to lead to serious consequences in that private members of the trading party state that such concessions are, in spite of all agreements to . the contrary, purely temporary and that the Soviet authority will not hesitate to re-absorb them as soon as the internal organisation of Russia enables it to do so.The Soviet Governments order for locomotives to Messrs. Arm-strong, Whitworth, and Company is believed not to be of great importance to Russia from an economic standpoint, but its announcement was a distinct political score for the Russians.It is reported from an inside source that the reserves of gold remaining in Russia amount to 65,000,000/. and the reserves of platinum to 3^ tons.
Custom Houses of the Soviet Republic appear to have been authorised to confiscate all foreign money from citizens lauding in Russia and to repay them according to the value in roubles established by the Deputy of the Peopled Commissariat for Finance.A union is proposed between the Communist Party and the Jewish Bund.FINLAND.The Communists appear divided. General Manneriieim is. reported to have declared that the danger of Bolshevism is past for Finland. There seem to be plans for sending Finnish Communists gradually to England as engineers and stokers ou Scandinavian boats.LATVIA.Interior conditions grow worse, and the liussian Communists seem to have made some progress in increasing strikes, setting up Bolshevik Committees in important works and undermining army discipline by planting Bolsheviks among the soldiers. Among the people, however, memories of Bolshevik rule are sufficient to prevent a revolution, unless it is brought about with the help of the Soviet Government.ESTHONIA.At the recent elections the Communist section of the Left Party polled only 5 per cent, of the total number of votes, ajraiust 30 per cent, in 1917. Esthonian Communists have decided to unite and work under the leadership of the Third International. A steady increase of agitation and propaganda is reported.The appointment of Litvinoff as representative of Soviet Russia in Esthonia indicates that Heval has now taken the place formerly held by Copenhagen as the Russian &quot; diplomatic &quot; centre abroad.LITHUANIA.An increase of pro-Bolshevism is reported among the town workers. Landowners are still being persecuted. Peasants who owu land are firmly anti-Bolshevik, but politically undeveloped. Though some improvement in the feeling towards England is reported, the press remains anti-English.POLAND.The Polish Ministry for Foreign Affairs has received reports from Riga that the Soviet Delegation is purposely prolonging the peace negotiations in order to give time for the deepening of social conflicts caused by the grave economic crisis through which Poland is passing.Though the Communist effort to capture the peasants has failed, the Communists anticipate that the emigration of Jews from Russia to Poland will increase the economic crisis and supply Poland with revolutionaries.GREECE.The new Government has decided to continue the Venizelist legisla-tion on the compulsory expropriation of large estates. At the elections the Commuuists received soma money from the Royalists. They are reported to be financially straitened since the arrest of a messenger they had sent to Russia for money.
There appears to he some danger that officers and public officials turned out by Venizelos may discount the consequences to themselves of his possible return by getting rid of leading Venizelists.The return of King Constantino has contributed to throw the affairs of the Greek Church into disorder. In Constantinople Venizelos is still prayed for. The Government have cut off the subsidy which they allowed tho Patriarch in Coustautinople, whore, however, it is beiug collected by the local Venizelists.BULGARIA.The use of compulsory labour is reported to have saved the country about 200,000,000 leva. Tho intention of training a new army is disclaimed,TURKEY.In Anatolia the Nationalists are disguising their real repugnance to communism beneath some show of applying revolutionary principles.PERSIA.Tchitcherin has requested the Persian Government to give freedom of action to the Communist Party. An amnesty will consequently be granted to all political offenders on the understanding that if members of the party err again the Soviet Government will abstain from asking pardon.EGYPT.Real uneasiness underlies a strange amalgam of suspense and indiffer-ence. Much of the present surface quiet is due to the courts-martial. Uuiuformed Egyptians reason that the collapse of cotton values, which is hitting tho rich natives hard, synchronises curiously with the promise of independence, and are inclined to look upon the collapse as created by the English to give Egypt an example of their power.Adli Pasha^ policy of conciliatory negotiations is gaining adherents. -The opinion is growing among the intelligent classes that Zagloul&apos;s obstinacy in insisting on the abolition of the Protectorate before the resumption of negotiations is a threat to the independence of Egypt. The indifference of the Fellahin to everything but their immediate necessities . and the sinalluess of the groups actively interested iu politics are an invitation to hurry slowly with their reforms.PALESTINE.The different peoples of the country are reported to be watching carefully how far the present Jewish administration is going to extend.THE CAUCASUS.Reports of an early Bolshevik attack upon Georgia receive some confirmation from statements attributed to Kopp. Schiemanu, the Bolshevik emissary in Georgia, has been recalled for bungling the scheme to cause a Red revolt, which would have brought the waiting Bolshevik army over the frontier.APGANISTAN.It is believed that Kabul will, in future, be the headquarters of Bolshevik propaganda for India. Proposals are on foot for the transfer thither of Indian revolutionaries in Bolshevik hands from Tashkent. Mahendra Nath Roy was behind the scheme, but it is doubtful whether be will return from Moscow, as he is not in good odour with the Indians.
Suritz, the Bolshevik representative at Kabul, has been replaced by one Legrand, the head Bolshevik representative in Armenia.SIBERIA.A conference of Socialists of the Far East reported by Moscow marks . the beginning of united revolutionary work by the Far Eastern Prole-tariat.   Japanese hopes that the Vladivostock Assembly would not acquiesce in tho Communist regime, established at Chita, have been disappointed.CANADA.The cut in wages is on the whole being accepted with a good grace, though in certain industries the drop has been considerable. The growing bitterness against foreigners, while iucreasing the possibility of disorder, may interfere with the plans of the agitators, who openly prefer foreign to English-speaking workmen.SOUTH AFRICA.The hoped for landslide to the Nationalists has not taken place. The Nationalist lenders, while deprecating the idea of force, have sown the seeds of anti-British feeling and some of their followers are ripe for mischief. Signs of uurest amongst the natives are attributed to inadequate pay. ;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Ludwig Martens and his staff embarked on their return to Russia on January 22ud, proceeding direct to Gothenburg after making arrange-ments for the continued use of Russian money for propaganda purposes. Negro agitation is reported to be on the increase. The threat of de Valera&apos;s secretary to call a vendetta against the English in the United States has aroused a storm of protest.ARGENTINE.Strikes are numerous, two of the more serious being the agrarian strike in the cereal districts and the strike of the employees of the West India Oil Company, which may result in shortages of petroleum and naphtha in the capital.
CONFIDENTIAL.MONTHLY REVIEW OF REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS, No. 26, DECEMBER 1920.Errata.Page 44, line 19.   For &quot; 500,000 &quot; read &quot; 5,000.&quot; Page 65, line 53.   For &quot; Frank &quot; read u Walter B.&quot;A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES. FRANCE.Unemployment.France as a whole continues sound.. The peasantry, even in the least settled districts and those, like the Laudes and Basses Pyrenees, where the Communists are most active, are at heart much more reactionary than Communist. Unemployment is the urgent problem, and regarding this certain observers believe that public demonstrations will occur before long.Buyers have struck, a fact for which the excessive profits of middle-men, rather than the high cost of production, have to answer. Ribbons produced at 6 francs a yard at St. Etienne are sold in Paris at 120 francs. So in St. Etieune 8,000 ribbon makers are workless. At Avignon 5,000 workers in the clothing trade are out of work, and the Lyons mills are on. short time. In the Amiens district reconstruction will absorb many of the 8,000 workless. In Alsace the trade and labour crisis is describe! as severe.The Communists and the Peasantry.Agrarian France, however, and the sons and daughters of agrarian France in city and town stand solid on the basis of liberal Republicanism. Only in one district of France, the Laudes and Basses Pyrenees, does Leuin&apos;s &quot;germ cell&quot; system appear to be operating, and that, curiously, is a district in which the system of land tenure laid down by the Code Napoleon has not been applied. The Landes and Bassees Pyrenees is an area not of small holdings, but of the larger farms called melairies, where the system of payment is of rent in kind. Wlien, during the war, the price of agricultural products rose to a point never before attained, the farmers and labourers, their burden already increased by the removal to the Front of every valid man of military age, felt that the landowners&apos; share of the profits had risen out of all proportion to what was just and reasonable. The farmers&apos; dissatisfaction was exploited by extremists, many of them Italians and Spauiards employed at the Boucot Iron Foundry, near Bayoune, where the workmen had been on strike for months.   The
leaders of the extremists took the opportunity of spreading Bolshevism and planting &quot; germ cells &quot; throughout the country side. Recently tho Govern-ment has expelled the principal Italian ringleaders, and emissaries of the Confederation Generate du Travail, alarmed by tho growing Communist influence, have also been doing their best to quiet the peasants. It is thought, however, that the best mode of dealing with lho unrest would be to remove its occasion, and that a law abolishing the system of metayage would inoculate the district against the Communist virus.The by-election in the Aveyron Department (M. Leygues&apos; con-stitueuey) in which Jean Renaud, the Socialist candidate, defeated the Government candidate by 6,000 votes, has some significance as showing the eflect of Bolshevik propaganda upon the peasantry. Rcnaud appealed to the desire to maKe Germany pay, to the feeling against military adventures in tho Near East, and to prejudices against the alleged profiteers of the Bloc National. It should, however, be noted that on the day of Kenaud&apos;s election the Communist candidate in a by-election in the Paris district was cius liugly defeated. A heated debate on these by-elections followed in the Chamber, the then Government deprecating both Socialist and Royalist and Clerical propaganda and escaping with a small majority.The Arrests of the Communists.The French police have for some time been especially vigilant against the many revolutionaries of all nationalities who have lately been coming to France, and particularly to Paris. No less than 1,200 . persons, including 600 foreigners, havo recently been detained and interrogated, and 50 remanded for further interrogation. Stimulated possibly by the publicity given to the well managed appearance of Clara Zetkin, the German Communist, at the Tours Congress, the police began to inquire into the fabrication of passports, which was rumoured to be rife in Paris. A big raid on January 30th brought about the arrest of a number of Russians, Serbs, and Czecho-Slovaks, all active Communists, on a technical charge of possessing false passports. A member of the organisation, one Dr. Abramovitch alias Dr. Zalewsky, had been living for some time at Montmartre, and getting wind of the coming inquiries fled to Nice, where he was, however, arrested along with his wife. Abrainovitch, who is either a Russian or a Czeoho-Slovak, and is known among the - initiated as the &quot; Eye of Moscow,&quot; attended the Tours Congress as a secret delegate of the Moscow International. The autho-rities believe that in Abramovitch they have taken the head of the International Communist organisation, working under the direct orders of the Moscow International, and financed by the Soviet to establish a strong French Communist Party. Some of the money is said to have reached Abramovitch via England, and some via Germany. A clandestine printing plant, alleged to produce seditious tracts, was also discovered. The presence of several hundred agents is known. The documents seized prove the existence in France of a Communist association related to the Russian Soviet and to Communist organisations in Europe generally. These documents are also said to disclose an international revolutionary movement, which is to declare itself either in the latter half of February or on May 1st. One of the few natives arrested in connec-tion with the plot is a certain OttoKeim alias Ker, a scholar of 1&apos;Ecole de Montbrison and a teacher of science in different schools in the south of France. Keim was also a member of the Conseil Federal de la Seine and of the executive of tho Socialist Party and collaborated in &quot;PHumanite.&quot; Keim, Abramovitch,Velitza Kossamovitcb, Ra limir, Vouiovihh, and Mil n Gueratowitch are to be charged with plotting against the security ol the
State and with offences against the law of 1894 dealing with anarchist agitation. All tho French Communist deputies, as well as Frossard, secretary of the Communist Party, are reported to be under close observation. Some of them may be arrested, as there are traces of their having received cheques from the men in custody.Communism and Labour.The definite split in the Socialist Party, which resulted from the Congress of Tours, is said to have delighted the French Government. It is hinted that the entry into France ofiClara Zetkiu was connived at since the authorities wanted to convince the nation that Moscow was usinjr Berlin to spread Bolshevism in France. The Government feels that public opinion, which is strongly anti-German, will support the firm measures it may take against Communist extremists. Meanwhile the new Communist Party has allied itself with Toinasi, the general secretary of tho Union of Syndicates of the Seine Department, for the purpose of spreading Bolshevism amongst the working classes, and of undermining the Confederation Generale du Travail.The infiltration of Communist members in the directing committees of the principal Trade Unions continues. Unions affected include those of the Clothing Trade, Metallurgists, Taxi-cab Drivers, Builders, and Navvies. This movement implies that at the next National Congress of the Unions the directing members of the C.G.T. will not be re-elected, and that Jouhaux will lose his post on the C.G.T. committee of direction. * A revolutionary working-class movement, aiming at establishing a government not quite on tho lines of Moscow, is indicated for the spring.Counter-Bolshevik action on the part of the 52 deputies who have cut adrift from the Third International is beginning to define itself. Longuet has expelled the directors of &quot;Clarte&quot; from the premises of &quot;&apos;Lo Popu-laire.&quot; After some hesitations, &quot; L&apos;Humanite &quot; has become the organ of the Communists, and is disseminating orthodox propaganda, not to uni-versal satisfaction. Twenty anarchists recently showed their disapproval of an article by invading the office, smashing the windows, cutting tele-phone wires, beating the staff, and shouting &quot; Down with the Dictator-ship.&quot;Albert Thomas, ex-Minister of Munitions and now director of the International Labour Bureau of the League of Nations, has been expelled by the Right Wing Socialist Party, to which Longuet belongs.Either Cachin or Frossard, and possibly both, are about to go to Moscow to intimate the official adhesion of the French Socialist Party to the Third International. The French will have a seat at the Secretariat at Leipzig of the Third International for Eastern Europe.Oriental Intrigue.Dr. Reshad Nihad Bey, of the Pan-Islamic Propaganda Bureau in Paris, editor of the &quot;Echo de lTslam,&quot; appears to have considerable influence among certain French politicians. He is reported to supply French Government circles with information from Angora, particularly concerning the National Assembly. Towards the middle of January he and M. le Coconnier-Pillon are said to have been promised by French ministers a revision of the Sevres Treaty in case anything happens to the Greeks. Funds are coming to the Comite la France et lTslam, with which these gentlemen are connected. Their propaganda represents Turkey as a victim of Germany, forced into the war against her will, and deprecates the idea of a rapprochement between Pau-Islamism and the Bolsheviks.
Political.M, Briaud, a realist, not to say an opportunist, in politics, has taken good stock of the firm Republicanism of the average Frenchman, and would &quot;appear from his attitude at the Conference of Paris to be acting accordingly. It is helieved that he at one time assured the Poles that it was his policy to balance European power on a strong Poland more than . ever before, and that the outcome of Marshal PilsudskTs visit to Paris would be a real Franco-Polish alliance. More recently M. Briand has informed the Poles that the Convention could only he considered in detail during Marshal PilsudskPs visit, and that signature was only possible after the Peace Treaty between Poland and Russia had been concluded. The visit, therefore, only consisted of a general discussion of Polish foreign policy in all its aspects, which will be the basis of a structure of. political and military treaties, whosei absolute conclusion has, however, been postponed at M. Briand&apos;s desire.The accession of M. Briand to power has been marked by the return to Paris of Caillaux, always his great friend, as also the friend of Paul Doumer, the new Finance Minister. Suggestions of occult influence by M. Caillaux on the new Cabinet have already been negatived by tho policy made manifest at the Conference. It is interesting to note, however, how varied are the influences surrounding M. Briand. He and Barthou have both pro-Turkish tendencies. M. Briaud&apos;s private secretary is M. Griinbaum-Ballin, brother-in-law of Herr Ballin, the former great German shipowner, and a naturalised French citizen since 1891. His political influence on Briand has always been marked and as invariably Germanophile. Indeed, before the Conference, extremists were looking to a full resumption of relations with Germany, to the recognition of the Soviet Government, to an economic alliance with Russia, and perhaps to an amnesty in favour of Caillaux and those condemned for plotting against the security of the State.In the meantime the decisions of the Conference, reinforced by M. Briand&apos;s speeches in the Chamber, hold the field as definitions of French policy. But even &quot; Pertinax,&quot; talking of reparations, dwells plaintively on the lack of continuity shown in its recent manifestations and in the mingling of half a dozen projects in casual conversations held with Italy, England, and Belgium. &quot; Pertinax &quot; cries for an escape from confusion. The cat is struggling in the bag ; it remains to be seen which way she will jump when she conies out of it.There is in Paris an organisation, known as Elbazil, which is composed of Egyptians, Greeks, and Turks, and supports Egyptian Nationalism and the revision of tho Treaty of Sevres. It is Bolshevik so far as Bolshevism serves va ends. It may otherwise he described as partly Germanophile, partly Nationalist, and wholly anti-British.Persian intrigue in Paris would appear to have a good deal to do with a suspicious Oriental, believed to bo a Persian, named Hussein Khan, a friend of Ispahani, and reported to have connections with the French Foreign Office. He is rumoured to have been at one time editor of the &quot; Zabani Azad&quot; at Teheran, from which city ho was deported. He lived in Paris under a false name, chttuges his hotel frequently, and is said to have dealings with an anti-British group of Persians, which is itself in toush with Lausanne.A publication called &quot; Bulletin dTnforinatiou Indienne,&quot; directed by Amitabha Ghose, but really organised by Professor Benoy Kumar Sarkar, has started gratuitously in Paris. It appears to advocate Indian &quot;freedom.&quot;
The Senate lias declined to vote this year the resumption of diplo-matie relations with tho Vatican. The Bill of 1920 is favoured by M. Briaud, who is nevertheless strongly opposed to a Papal Nuncio in Franco. The Bill, although passed by the Chamber of Deputies in that year, became obsolete through its not having been passed by the Senate in the same year, and consequently must be again presented to the Chamber of Deputies in 1921.BELGIUM.The Industrial Situation: Communism.The industrial situation shows no improvement. Unemployment continues to spread and works continue to close. The Belgian Trade Union Commission has asked the Government to double the out-of-work allowance of three francs a day, to requisition factories and raw materials, and to start large public works without delay. There have been numerous public demonstrations against the alleged inactivity of the Government. Competent opinion generally considers that the crisis will become more acute, but hopes that his sound common sense will save the Belgian worker from Bolshevism. The revolutionary groups &quot;Les Amis de 1&apos;Exploite &quot; and &quot;La Confederation Communiste Beige&quot; are making full use of the crisis. Despite the failure of the Extremist strike of miners about Charleroi, Communist propaganda continues in the Charleroi and Boriuage districts. There is talk of a forthcoming attempt to organise an International Communist Conference in Belgium, probably at Brussels.There is some tendency to advocate &quot; Councils of Workshops &quot; and the organisation of the control of enterprises. The Builders&apos; Union and that of the kindred trades have agreed upon amalgamation.As a means of improving the industrial situation the Government is considering the control of prices charged by the producer.The Labour Split.The practical expulsion of Jacquemotte by the official Labour Party has divided his former supporters in Brussels. The Brussels branch of the &quot; Parti Ouvrier&quot; has referred the matter to the groups affiliated lo the Brussels Federation. The majority will more than probably decide for continued participation in the official Labour Party, to the consequent isolation of Jacquemotte and his supporters. The split in the Labour Party has led to the appearance of three elements the &quot;Parti Ouvrier,&quot; or Labour Party, which includes the orthodox Socialists; &quot;La Federation Bruxelloise,&quot; led by Jacquemotte, with branches in the mining and industrial districts called &quot; Les Amis de 1&apos;Exploite,&quot; and composed of advanced Socialists; and the &quot;Parti Communiste Beige,&quot; which is led by W. van Overstraeteu, and which has advanced considerably during the past few months, chiefly owing to the zeal of its leader. Jacquemotte, it is hinted, may ally himself with van Overstraeten, a course which means political embarrassment if not downfall for both.ITALY.The Leghorn Conference.The event of the month has been the annual conference of the Socialist Party, which opened at Leghorn on January 15th. As is well known, at the Congress at Bologna in 1919, the party adhered to the Third International, but Lenin felt the attitude of the Italians not
combative enough and dictated his 21 points. Tho disruptive tendencies at work in the party resulted in the presence at the Congress of three main groups ; the Right Socialists headed by Turati, whose programme was that of pre-war Marxism ; the United Communists headed by Serrati, who accept the 21 points with some local reservations ; and the lutran-sigeant Communists headed by Bombacci, upholding pure Bolshevism. Tho United Communist Party was the strongest.Over three thousand delegates attended the Conference to find their patience exhausted by the dull and laborious arguments of indifferent orators. They livened the proceedings in a meridional way by shouting down their adversaries, and by indulging in fisticuffs and uproars, which were checked with difficulty by the singing of revolutionary hymns. The Conference, far from being a model of socialist discipline and obedience, was indeed an exhibition of party strife, which even the members of the future Red Army, appointed to keep order in the Congress, were powerless to quell.The Conference opened with the reading of the message from Moscow by a Bulgarian Bolshevist. This was anything but conciliatory, and can best be described as a bull of excommunication. It was a fierce iudict-ment of the Italian Socialists, and branded even Serrati as an opportunist. Resentment, blows, insults, and fiery speeches followed. Bombacci even levelled a revolver at the head of an opponent.Terracina, speaking for the &quot; Pure Communists,&quot; declared that tho material conditions of revolution in Italy exist, but the spiritual do not. &quot;Our present tragic situation is that the middle classes are unable to &quot; exercise power, while the proletariat, although prepared, has not the &quot; means to seize it that is, it has no Communist Party.&quot;The result of the voting revealed the anticipated schism. 98,026 voted for the Unitari; 14,685 for the Centrist! ; and 58,783 for the self-styled &quot;Communisti puri.&quot; The latter thereupon left the Conference in a body, headed by Bombacci, and repaired to the Teatro San Marco, where they held a private meeting.The upshot is that an Italian Communist Party, entirely independent of the Socialists, now exists. The directing committee will be composed of Bordiga, Misiano, Bombacci, Terracini, and Gonnari, and ten other less prominent persons. The party has 18 out of 156 Socialist deputies, iucluding Graziadei and Bombacci. It will publish a weekly newspaper, the &quot; Communista,&quot; and will pursue a determined anti-Socialist policy.The Socialist Party will itself present a more united front. Serrati&apos;s directorship of the &quot; Avanti&quot; will be confirmed, and certain deputies will be admitted to the directing committee of the party, from which deputies have hitherto been excluded. A 4further Congress of the Socialist Party is announced to settle problems which have arisen.The Industrial Situation.Signor AlessuVs measure for the Syndicalist control of industries as a consequence of the metal-workers&apos; strike last year has now been intro-duced to the Chamber. Separate control is provided for the more important industries, the control to be operated by the State, and industries employing less than 60 men, as well as new industries, to be excluded from control for four years. Joint committees of workmen and employers, each numbering nine members (three members of the Work-meu&apos;s Committees to be technical experts), will exercise control, and will be renewed every three years. The Bill provides for the giving to the workmen&apos;s committee of all information regarding the operation and conduct of the industry, with the exception of trade secrets.   Occasional
joint sessions of the workmen&apos;s and employers&apos; committees are provided for. Workmen cannot be discharged for their political opinions. Each committee will delegate two workmen in each factory for the purpose of keeping the committee informed. Manufacturers have the right to send two delegates to all meetings of tho committee.Provincial Unrest.Nationalist excesses are reported from widely different quarters; the general object seems to be the destruction of the property of revolutionary organisations. Thus at Florence the Socialist daily &quot;La Difesa &quot; had its works destroyed. A general strike followed. The situation through-out Emilia is very tense, and the disarmament of the population is proving difficult. At Trieste 100 Leninist revolutionaries seized the works of the Socialist organ &quot; II Lavoratore,&quot; and turned adrift the staff, who refused to obey them. It does not appear, however, that the Reds could produce the paper.There has also been serious religious rioting in various parts of the country, and a fight between the Fascisti and revolutionary Socialists at Castellamare di Stabia, near Naples, resulted in the death of tight persons and the serious wounding of 15. This affair Avas the lesult of a Socialist attempt to set up genuine Bolshevist rule.There are some reports of fresh labour troubles at Milan. The workers seized the Bianchi factory, one of the largest cycle plants in Italy, and hoisted the Red Flag over the buildings. In general, bow-ever, things in Milan are very much quieter. The workmen are working and apparently realise that they have been used as pawns in a political game. No strikes are contemplated, and the Socialist leaders admit that Bolshevism in practice was a failure. The Italian Federation of Metal Workers has circulated to the engineering trades a printed report criticising the Bolshevik Government. The trade outlook, especially in engineering industries, is not good, but the amount of unemployment is not yet great. As a proof of a returning reign of reason it may be mentioned that no strikes took place when Malatesta was arrested, though the Extremists did what they could to start a railway strike in Northern Italy.The unrest in agricultural districts is causing farmers to neglect their farms and to put no money into them. The last harvest suffered enormously, and farmers lost heavily. It is symptomatic that the Crown Spelter Company at Ponte di Nassa, an English company, has closed down permanently, owing to the impossibility of carrying on profitably on account of the wages asked by the workmen.Fiume.The expulsion of D&apos;Annunzio has not settled the Fiume question. The Hungarian and Croat elemeuts, repressed during the late regime, are uniting against the Italians, and claiming an autonomous state with a free port for Hungary and Yugo-Slavia. Against them are solidly ranged the Italians, as well as the war profiteers, to whom D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s methods of dealing with the Socialists appealed. Out of D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s ex-legionaries nearly 1,000, whom the poet created citizens, are staying in the city. The legionaries, who are youngsters in bad condition and of unsavoury reputation, are supposedly disarmed, but it would appear that large quantities of weapons are still hidden.The Vatican and Sinn Fein.Count 0&apos;Kelly, the President of the Sinn Fein Delegation in Paris, and many prominent Sinn Feiners, are reported recently to have gone toA
Fribourg for a conference on the Irish situation, invitations to which have been issued by the Vatican. The Papal Nuncio was to preside, several Irish prelates from the Irish college at Rome were to attend, and the proceedings were to bo secret.The attitude of the Vatican to Sinn Fein would appear to be non-committal. The Pope is reported to have told two nuns, sisters of Lord Dufreyne (De Fresno ?), assuming that they were Sinn Feiners, not to expect much, but to keep calm and to trust to prayer. Papal interven-tion in favour of Sinn Fein is unlikely, but it is possible that further Sinn Fein conferences will be held in Rome.Thomas Kelly and the rector of the Irish college in Rome have gone to Naples to await tho arrival of the Archbishop of New York, who is coming to Rome on his visit ad limina.It is reported that Anglo-American journalists have had instructions from London to await a probable message from the Pope to Ireland condemning Black and Tan atrocities.Early in January Gavan Duffy was in Rome, apparently more or less secretly. The Vatican had not been informed of his arrival, which was unknown even among the unimportant members of the Irish colony. He had seen few people, with the exception of the notorious Monsignor Hagau, rector of the Irish college, and a few Irish priests. Before Gavan Duff&apos;y&apos;s arrival Sinn Fein interests in Rome were looked after by one Patrick MacSweeney, at one time a papal marquis and a papal Chamberlain of Cape and Sword. MacSweeney&apos;s reputation was distinctly unsavoury, and he left Rome some years ago after a scandal compromising him with the Vatican. Duffy is known at the Vatican to be MaoSweeuey&apos;s successor, and, as the friend of a black sheep, will not easily be well received in Vatican circles. His associations with MacSweeney may account for his inactivity.Anti-British Sentiment ai;d Intrigue.Evidence of anti-British propaganda, initiated by Germans and Ameri-cans, is forthcoming. A virulent article has appeared in the &quot;Tempo,&quot; a paper with Government support. It would appear that Signor Giolitti is not anxious to check the activity of his underlings, such as the pro-German Ambrozini. The Standard Oil Company is said to be about to buy the &quot;Idea Nazionale &quot; and the &quot;Tempo&quot; with a view to conducting an anti-English campaign. Counter-propaganda by the press bureau would appear to be called for.Miscellaneous.Bologna, which been administered for 18 months by a Communist town council, is affording Italy an object lesson. The council paid their workmen enormous wages, and reduced rates, tramcar fares, and customs duties. An inquiry oidered by the prefect of tie province shows inextricably confused accounts and a deficit of .150,000/. Public health services have been neglected and the.hospitals are closing.Two members of the Italian Delegation to Russia, Nofri and Pozzali, have published a book recounting their experiences and strongly denouncing Bolshevism. As a counterblast the Communists are circu-lating glowing accounts of conditions in Russia.SPAIN.Labour and Communism.The National Confederation of Labour has broken with the Socialist Party and General Workers&apos; Union.   The Confederation, representing
the extreme Syndicalists, opposed political action and favoured violence, beginning with a general strike ; the Workers&apos; Union, led by Socialists, decided to take part in the elections and insisted on the certain failure of a general strike. Manifesto and counter-manifesto followed. The elections showed the result of the split. Whereas last year Socialists and Republicans carried all the Madrid parliamentary seats, at this election six monarchical candidates headed the poll, and only two Socialists were elected.A fiery appeal has been sent out from Moscow to the workmen of all countries, to the organisations adhering to the Communist International, and especially to the Spanish &quot; comrades,&quot; asking all workmen to refuse to touch Spanish goods or to use Spanish materials.De los Rios and Anguiano, who were sent to Moscow by the Spanish Socialist Party to present the Party&apos;s conditions for affiliation to the Third International, have returned disillusioned from Russia, but, it is said, full of admiration for the possibilities of the Russian Revolution. Moscow was not inclined to water its decisions, and Lenin declared that the 21 points had to be severe or they would be bothered with reformists and opportunists. &quot; We have never spoken of liberty,&quot; said Lenin, &quot; we exercise the dictatorship of the proletariat in the name of a &quot; minority because the peasant class in Russia is not proletariat, and &quot; is not yet with us. We shall exercise the dictatorship over them until &quot; they submit.&quot;The Situation in Barcelona.The authorities in Barcelona appear superficially to have gained a decisive victory. There is, however, much to be done before the Confederacion becomes a sound element of public life. It must be remembered that unrest in Spain is revolutionary, not economic. The workers are on the whole contented with their short hours and high wages, and in view of the beginning .world-wide reduction of wages agitation based on a demand for higher pay will find its scope reduced in future. The strikes that&apos; occur are engineered by a handful of extremists for their own purposes, without the general approval of the men.The action of the authorities has been stern there are 25 per cent, more men in gaol than there were at the beginning of last year. Anido stopped the daily assassinations by the Red Syndicalists through counter-assassinations by the Free Syndicalists, who also killed a lawyer who always defended the assassins in the law courts. The attempted general strike in reply did not daunt the Governor. Our informant states that from conversations he has had Avith the Civil Governor himself, he believes that many of the Red leaders deported to Mahon will never be seen again. The number of mysterious disappearances of Red Syndicalists was unknown to the general public and the press, but the Syndicalists themselves were frightened into more regular methods. The.confidence of the workmen in the Red Syndicate has vanished altogether. The men, who were getting no pay from the Syndicate, returned gladly to work, and many of them have seceded to the Free Syndicate.The present quiet in Barcelona depends, of course, upon Anido remaining in office, or on the continuation of his policy.The drastic measures taken have led many Syndicalists to hand in or destroy their affiliation cards. There are signs, however, that fresh cards are being taken out. A great many leaders have been thrown into gaol ; meetings are liable to arrest in a body, and subscriptions are collected under considerable difficulties, since anyone seen collecting money is 0  as 8671 b
immediately arrested. It is natural that violence should have considerably lessened.In spite of its severity tho Government cannot bo accused of injustice. When, at the critical moment following tho failure of the tramway strike, the Confedcracion ordered the men working the dynamos to leave, the Government turned the Guardia Civil into the power station, and tho men wore forced to work under a threat of being shot if their machines stopped. In the absence of reliefs some men worked for 48 hours. It is added that &quot;at the end of that time, things onco again became normal.&quot;On his return from Italy Pestana has been lodged in Barcelona gaol. His travels in Russia and Germany appear to have disillusioned him.The latest reports indicate a recrudescence of terror in Barcelona, where a number of violent deaths have occurred.The Elections and after.The elections, though they give a sufficient Government majority, do not provide Dato with an absolute majority in the Commons. llis party numbers 200 ; the united opposition, 210, including at preseut 3 Social-ists, 16 Republicans, and 14 to 16 Catalanistas. Dato is not likely, howeArer, to find himself in a minority. The Governments social pro-gramme cannot yet be accurately forecasted. The chief business will be financial and the first hard fight will be over the Railway Tariffs, on&apos; which question Dato will be opposed by La Cierva, possibly the cleverest man in Parliament.The resignation of Senor Dato, who called the election but retired before Parliament was sworn in, thoroughly bewildered the public. The suggestion was made in military quarters that General Anido should be called from Barcelona and apply his local policy geuerally. The King meanwhile, after taking the advice of his political leaders, asked Dato to form a new cabinet.PORTUGAL.The situation remains uncomfortable if not precarious. The exchange continues to fall and prices to rise. There have been food riots in the country, and there is discontent in the towns. Foreign trade is almost paralysed.Towards the middle of December the latest drastic financial proposals were being strongly opposed. It was argued that they are borrowed from foreign countries and do not suit Portuguese conditions. The resemblance of the proposed new death duties to the English death duties was instanced.The Government, however, control the Army and have the situation in hand. The Prime Minister, Liberato Pinto, has, for the moment, postponed the appointment of his followers as civil governors. There was considerable opposition to this by the other groups, and the rift in the cabinet has been widened.The Integralista Movement.A speech by Dr. Alexandre Braga at Oporto, in which allegations were made that the revolution of Sidonio Paes was brought about on the understanding that no more troops should be sent to the front in short, by the cowardice of Portuguese officers who did not wish to risk their skins was hotly resented by Alvaro de Castro, Minister of War, and very nearly caused a cabinet crisis. The crisis was, however, averted, and the cabinet continues to do fairly well.   There are rumours that the
Integralistas may attempt a revolution in February in favour of Don Duarto Numo do Braganca, the Integralist nominee to the throne.In connection with the movement some collusion is alleged between the ex-Emperor of Austria and a family of Saldanha de Gama in Switzerland. Gossip also mentions that money has boon supplied by the Jesuits for a Monarchical movement in Portugal. Anns and ammunition have been smuggled into the country from Belgium and Spain, and there has been propaganda throughout the provinces. Attempts are being made to tamper with the loyalty of the Army, and plans for a rising and a march on Lisbon are spoken of. The success of any revolt is, however, highly problematical.Extremists and Strikes.The inner circles of tho Confcderacao Geral de Trabalho are reported to be much divided. A new Extreme Left Party to be called &quot; 0 Partido Communista Social &quot; is to be formed by the extremists.A man named Joao Faira, who has been imprisoned in Oporto for two and a half years for active Bolshevik propaganda, has continued his activities in the prison, and has been trying to convert the warders and his fellow prisoners to Bolshevism. He has now been transferred to Lisbon.A strike of journalists and printers has been the latest tribulation of Lisbon a strike justified by inadequate pay and disregard of demands. Owing, however, to the scanty funds of the strikers the strike is unlikely to last long. In order that the public may know the news the Prime Minister has arranged for soldiers with a knowledge of press work to produce an amalgamated daily newspaper.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. NORWAY.The Norwegian Labour Party and the Communists.Taught apparently by the failure of the recent railway strike, the leaders of the Norwegian Labour Party are reported to have adopted a programme including the gradual but relentless exclusion of anti-Moscow Socialists, the formation of a purged and trustworthy Communist revolutionary bloc, incitement to a tenants&apos; and taxpayers&apos; strike, and a campaign against the present system of N.O.T.U., which is to be rccon-structed on lines nearer Communism. Sabotage and ca&apos; canny methods, especially in the motor car industry, are also to be practised, but of these the Norwegian Labour Party avoids any official cognisance. It is hoped by these means to dislocate motor communication when the next strike comes. Meamvhile ca&apos; canny is to be used universally, so as to increase unemployment and discontent, and derange finance.It is reported that the loaders of the Norwegian Labour Party have arrived at a secret agreement with the Soviet Authorities, pledging themselves to carry out all orders received from Moscow. Should a revolution break out, North Norway will become an independent Border Soviet Republic, and Russia has pledged herself to support the revolution in every way.A.rvid Hansen, Avho is now in Berlin, has informed Madsen that the Norwegian campaign for Soviet councils should be run on the lines accepted by the German Communists and that intensive propaganda should be started immediately. Hansen has also reported on the educational training of young Communists.
The Socialist Madsen, in whoso luggage on his return from Moscow were found 70,000 roubles in gold, has been fined 100 kroner for a breach of Customs regulations. As importation of gold is not illegal, the roubles will be released. Madscn alleges that the Soviet intended the money for expenses in connection with trade resumption between Norway and Russia; the Conservative press suspects that the money was for propaganda.Holtermann, the doyen of Norwegian Socialists, is advocating pcace-ful penetration of the rifle clubs and the formation of workers&apos; armed clubs. These views express the underlying schemes of the Tarty leaders to follow Moscow&apos;s plans for successful revolution.A Socialist Split.The Congress of the Social Democratic opposition group has decided by 168 votes to 18 to constitute the &quot; Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway.&quot; This body, which is formed as a protest against the Bolshevik tendencies of the official Labour Party and its acceptance of the leadership of Moscow, offers a home to all Socialists who renounce Moscow and its works. In the Storthing 9 out of 17 members of the Socialist group, including some of the most eminent Norwegian Socialists, have allied themselves with the Moderates. The electoral prospects of the new party appear to be good.Miscellaneous.A campaign against British rule in India is reported to be contem-plated by the &quot; Kristiania Arbeiter Samfundet&quot; and Norwegian Labour Party in the Socialist and other press. Similar propaganda seems to have been started in Denmark, and the Indian Committees in Stockholm, Berlin, and New York are said to inteud an International anti-British propaganda. The source of the Norwegian agitation would appear to be foreign, but the precise source, whether German or Russian, or both, is not yet apparent.SWEDEN.Communism.The section of Left Socialists who decline to swallow Lenin&apos;s potion without some modification of its ingredients, has met and defined its position. They neither wish to split the party nor to renounce the Third International, but they claim freedom of opinion and reject a Russian dictatorship. Should the majority persecute or penalise them they will defend themselves. They range themselves as supporters of Vennerstrom, and appear to believe that they will have converted the majority when the voting takes place in February.The Communist Night School, established at Stockholm last year, has started upon its second term. Karl Malmsten is principal ; among the directors are C. N. Carleson, A. R. Svensson, Nils Flygg, Arvid Vretling, and Gustav Flodin. Instruction in Socialism is compulsory ; the other courses help those who wish to become professional agitators. There were only 72 pupils at the principal school and 24 at the South Stockholm branch last year.A Swedish translation of Lansbury&apos;s book on Russia is being largely advertised in the &quot; Politikeu.&quot;Trade with Russia.Strom and Hellberg have now legalised their position and put an pfficial diplomatic cloak over their activities ; Strom as Consul for Russia,
107DENMARK.The Revolutionaries.The Communist Party, now known as the Danish Communist Party, Section of the Third International, has among its leaders A. G. Joergen-sen and Marie Nielsen. It is under the orders of Stockholm ; its statutes include the 21 points. The party is unrepresented in Parliament; it polled scarcely 4,000 votes at the last elections. The party has lately been active, but any real success is limited to the ports. It is reported that at the last Moscow Congress Mario Nielsen was promised 100,000 crowns if the party rallied to the Third International. As this has happened the money has probably been received.The Danish Syndicalist Party, led by Christenseu, chief editor of &quot; Solidaritet,&quot; has 8,000 or 9,000 adherents. The party rejects parlia-meutarism and recognises terrorism. It still belongs to the Geneva International, despite Moscow&apos;s efforts to rally it to the Third Inter-national. The little money it has comes from contributions, subscriptions, and subsidies from Second International Syndicalists.The Jewish Bund, who have been well supplied with funds from Russia, have given 10,000 kr. to the paper &quot; Arbeidct,&quot;as the Bolsheviks dare not start a paper of their own in Denmark. The daily publication of &quot; Arbeidet &quot; will, therefore, continue.The Economic Situation.Unemployment is growing. The week ending January 7th showed an increase of Danish unemployed from 48,484 to 52,711. Tho Copen-hagen Council has been recommended to adopt palliative measures, the money to be loaned by the State.The surplus of 141,000,000 kroner estimated in the. original budget has turned into a corresponding deficit. The total Stale debt is o as 8671 and Ilcllberg as commercial attache. The Foreign Ministry has been notified of these appointments.Krassin and Gunuar Anderssen, tho virtual owner of the engineering works, Nidquist and Holm, have settled their quarrel. The Swedes, fearing a possible trade agreement between England aud Russia and American concessions, did not insist absolutely upon a guarantee of 75,000,000 crowns. Krassin, after bargaining, consented to a fresh payment of 10,000,000 crowns to tho Swedish syndicate. Gunnar Andersseu has been attempting to enter the United Kingdom in order ostensibly to negotiate about the supply of certain spare parts for loco-niotives. This man&apos;s activities, and his introduction into all the Swedish works over which he has been able to get control, of the Soviet systems of factory work make it evident that he is a political as well as a com-mercial agent of the Soviet Government. MM. Nidquist and Holm, whose firm he controls, and as whose agent ho purported to act, have been informed that it would be desirable that they should select another representative.27,500,000 kronen in Russian gold is reported to have arrived in Stockholm, intended for operating locomotive factories in Trollhiittan, which were acquired last year by the Centrosoyus for the purpose of turning out locomotives. Lomonosoff has full discretionary powers to use money for placing orders in the United Kingdom. Germany, Sweden, or elsewhere.Ordentich is reported to have stated that he has at his disposal in most European capitals 5,000,000 crowns in local currencies for the purpose of Soviet operations.
1,066,529,000 kronen, including the American loan for tho expenses of the Slesvig re-union. These expenses account for much of the expendi-ture, which is 200,000,000 to 250,000,000 kronen, and will probably ho 300,000,000 completely covered by the two American loans,3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HOLLAND.Unemployment.Unemployment increases steadily, but serious resultant trouble is not feared. The Trade Unions are growing weaker and the employers stronger. There are about 100,000 unemployed in Holland, and it is considered that, at the present rate, the Government will soon have to assist 50 to 60 per cont. of the population.Communism.Dutch Communists grow more and more dispirited at the emptiness of revolutionary prospects, They no longer, hope in England and have lost faith in a revolution in Germany.Troelstra, who is ultra pro-German, is reported to be working for the destruction of the Treaty of Versailles, using the S.D.A.P. as his dupes. He aims at stirring up anti-militarist feeling in Holland and in the Entente countries, with the ulterior object of so weakening the military poAver of the Entente that Germany may safely refuse to carry out the peace conditions. He is helped by the Belgian Actionists, and there are signs that his propaganda is gaining ground.   .The &quot; intellectual&quot; Bolsheviks in Holland fend oft depression with devoted optimism. At one of their Secret Conferences Markus made the statement that they were sending every week about 300 to 400 propa-gandists to the rural districts Avhich they already claimed as revolutionary. The Intellectuals must be prepared for the functions they Avould have to carry out. &quot; When Ave have the power in our hands Ave will simply put &quot; an ultimatum to Holland, and within 24 hours Holland will be a Soviet State.&quot; Hajuda declared&apos;-that in Friesland the &quot;Cell&quot; system was working among the troops. He also said that the revolutionary Scottish movement had reported that attempts were being made there to organise the Trade Organisations on a revolutionary Communist basis. Valkhof maintained that a campaign against the Roman Catholic organisations was necessary.The Delegation of the All Russian Union of the Chemical Industry have informed Stenhuis, secretary of the International Union of Factory Workers, that they would not be justified in joining the International Bureau of Factory Workers if this Avere equivalent to joining the Amsterdam International (I.V.V.). They proposed the abolition of Point 2 of the statutes in order to cancel the Avorking connection with the Amsterdam International. On Stenhuis pointing out that as secretary he had not the right to cancel Point 2, the Delegation agreed to submit their proposal to the International Bureau for decision. They are also submitting it to the leaders of their Union. Steuhuis has declared that the Russians&apos; sole object Avas to join the International Trade Secretariats in order to fight the I.V.V. indirectly.Zionism.The jewish organisation knoAvn as &quot;Keren Hajesod &quot; has now been established in Holland, At Rotterdam it was reported that Holland Avas expected to supply one million pounds out of the. thirty million required for the restoration of Palestine.
GERMANY.Communism.The financial situation of the Communist Party in Germany is reported from a most reliable source to be exceedingly precarious owing to the dearth of funds from Russia. Kopp has been applying to the Political Bureau of the Foreign Office to request the Communist Inter-national to send him subsidies, thus further emphasising the practical identity of the Soviet Government with the Third International.Independent revolutionary action on the part of the Communists is reported to be unlikely, but there would be a general union of Communists, Socialists, and Labour elements against any Right Putsch. It is said that a Red Army is being formed in Thuringia and Saxony. A Bolshevik advance westwards would be the signal for upheaval.It is reported that Moscow has ordered tho German Communist Party and the Now Communist Party to strike a decisive blow this winter after a general strike which is to develop into an armed revolt. The Communist Labour Party, which is ripe for action, but which lacks money and a strong enough organisation, is said to agree to the proposals of Moscow but to doubt the willingness of the Communist Party and the New Communists. Meanwhile Rasch and Schroder, representatives of the Communist Labour Party, are in Moscow. Though it opposes Moscow leadership of a German policy, this party hopes to procure from Moscow financial support and recognition as a member of the Third International. Meanwhile one part of the Communist Party centre is trying to englobe the Communist Labour Party in the newly constituted party, and the Right Independent Socialists are trying to frame a middle programme between the Trades Unions and the Workmen&apos;s Unions in the Reichstag, while it would apparently agree to share in a Left Putsch. The party leaders and the faction leaders of the Majority Socialists are credited with the intention of letting the Government remain in office until the end of the winter. The provisional Communist Party and Independent Central has formulated an organisation of the United Communist Parties of Germany according to the gospel of Moscow,The strike of agricultural labourers is over. Troops are still being cautiously and illegally organised. Workers in town and country are being unsettled by agitation. In Hamburg an organisation of workmen (Arbeitergemeinschaft) has been formed to spread propaganda through translations of foreign Left Radical organs. The Arbeiterscbaft also provides interpreters, messengers, and secret oourieis for abroad. In Bavaria agitation by the Left Radicals is growing. The Communists have hopes from their canvassing in barracks and amongst railwaymen and minor officials.The Revolutionaries are reported to be now turning their attention to the Ruhr district and to the railwaymen, among whom they have had some success. They are also stirring up the iron workers. The agita-tion may be inspired from Moscow, which, as it pays the Communist Party, wishes to call the tune. In Berlin the Communists are said to be working for the seizure of works in the Italian style.The Juvenile Communist International, founded in Berlin in 1919 for Communists between 14 and 18, intends holding an International Conference in April, probably in Berlin.The Russian section of the Communist Party in Germany has its headquarters at Engel Ufer, Berlin, but the work is done from the offices of the &quot; Rote Fahne &quot; and the offices of the Russian Prisoners-of-War in Potsdamerstr., Berlin. From the Prisoners-of-War offices it has rami-fications throughout Germany.   There are branch offices at Hamburg,0 2
Dresden, Bremen, and Munich ; each of the 22 sections of the Red Army lu Berlin has a Russian section. Tho work is that of general agitation and propaganda among the Russian colony and the Russian prisoners ; the registration of Russians in Germany, and the discreet organisation of fighting forces.The Russo-German Communist section is said to have set up an Intelligence Bureau in Berlin, a propaganda school at Neukoln, and a kind of revolutionary court-martial, of which tho standing members appear to be Franz Spery, Boris Nemtzoff, and Easoff.A reorganisation of the communications between the French Com-munists and the Bolsheviks is reported. The Communist Party office in Berlin is now charged with this. All communications between Russia, Holland, France, Switzerland, &amp;c, would now appear to centre in Berlin, where the Intelligence Office and courier services of the Third International are being reorganised and extended.Kopp&apos;s Status in Germany.Victor Kopp alleges that his status as trade representative of the Soviet Republic has been recognised by the German Government. His mission has branches at Hamburg under the German cx-naval Captain Geringer, and one Charles Gasparius, and at Stettin, under the former Russian Colonel Sabdovnikoft, and one Dipner. The Stettin branch works in conjunction with the Levant Steamship Line. He is also in close touch with an individual called Lapinsky, in Warsaw, who delivers to him transcripts from the Polish Foreign Office daily journal.Alleged repeated offers by Kopp to Germany of an economic and politico-military alliance are reported to have been received by von Simons in a non-committal manner. Opinion in Berlin as to the advisability of entering into such relations appears to be divided. Kopp strongly advises his Government to admit a German Commission of experts to visit Russia, a course to which Litvinoff and the ultra Reds have hitherto been opposed. The Commission in question appears to be that of the &quot; Russian Company for the Promotion of Commercial Rela-tions with Russia &quot; which is reported to have been actively at work in Baltic countries. Kopp is reported to have left Berlin on January 18th for Moscow via Kovno and Riga to make a personal report about current affairs. His trading transactions in Germany do not appear entirely to have met with the approval of Solomon at Reval, who seems to be under the impression that Kopp has a tendency to fritter away in unimpoitant purchases money which could be better used.The undoubted fact that Kopp&apos;s mission is very short of funds may be attributed to his differences with Litvinoff and Solomon. The policy of the Soviet Government towards the mission seems to be to ration it financially when little of importance is happening. Official funds for Kopp are transmitted by Reval via Helsingfors through the Dresdner Bank in Berlin. Unofficial funds for the Losowsky mission come in Swedish currency through Freimaun, the official financial courier of the Riga Mission.During December a new Syndicate for Foreign Trade with Russia was formed with a capital of 40,000,000 marks, headed by Stinnes, Fehrmann, and others. Stinnes&apos; chief interest is in Lithuania, and he wishes to use the German force there to stiffen Lithuania, and to use it in order to establish prosperity and German control in Lithuania. Trade with Russia so far has always shown an ultimate loss, hence the floating of this new concern as a Limited Company.Nikolaieff, Bolshevik Commissar for Postal and Telegraph Service in Berlin, is attempting to arrange an order with Siemens&apos; Works for
10,000 km. telegraph cable, 5,000 km. telephone cable, and a very largo quantity of telephone apparatus.Negotiations with the Bank of Otto Markewitz regarding the release of Bolshevik gold have been stopped by Kopp on account of Markewitz&apos;s death.The Question of Upper Silesia and Dantzig.Tho dato of the plebiscite in Upper Silesia has been fixed for March 13th and Gorman propaganda against Poland is being intensified. Gorman banks are at work to cause a further decline in the value of tho Polish mark, of which thoy buy enormous quantities, periodically flooding the market at a quotation lower than that of the other European exchanges. The people of Upper Silesia arc led to believe that, should the province go to Poland, the. Warsaw Government would take away the German money at the current rate of exchange and leave the new subjects with a worthless currency.An unofficial offer, refused by Germany, is rumoured to have been made by Poland, accepting part of the industrial area of Upper Silesia instead of a referendum.According to General SemenofTs representative in Berlin, Germany is considering the Polish offer to retain only a right-of-way in the Dantzig Corridor in return for a declaration maintaining the integrity and independence of Poland, should there be a fresh Bolshevik attack in the spring.Hwr Stinnes.Herr Hugo Stinues has extended his activities by buying two important Swiss newspapers, the &quot; Zuricher Post&quot; and the &quot; Basler Tageszeitung.&quot; He intends to found in Holland, Switzerland, and Scandinavia information &quot;bureaux, representing German interests abroad.In some circles doubts are growing of Herr Stinncs&apos; financial and commercial stability. His newspaper purchases, and his policy of running papers by supplying them with all raw materials, have not boon altogether successful. The &quot; Deutsche Allgemoine Zeitung,&quot; for iu-staitce, is still absorbing millions with, little improvement in circulation. The root of the matter seems to be that Stinnes&apos; interests are now too enormous for his personal supervision, and that many concerns of his are almost unknown to him in detail. Financially, it is disquieting to know that Stinues leans very substantially upon bank credits.The Industrial Situation.Before the decision of the Conference at Paris optimism and a reviving national spirit were reported from Germany. Nationalist propaganda was said to bo having its effect in Avinning over the peasants and tho lower middle class. It Avas felt that the Entente Avanted Germauy possibly more than Germany wanted the Entente, and that Central and Eastern Europe could not be reconstructed Avithout German assistance. More pessimistic views appear to be based on the alleged internal in-security of the country and the labour troubles. These are having some effect upon foreign investors, but there appears little doubt that the evil situation of the country has, for obvious reasons, been exaggerated.The great shipping companies, the Hamburg-Amcrika Linie, and the Norddeutsche Lloyd have, for instance, begun the reconstruction of the German mercantile marine, Avith the help of interested American groups. The construction of new vessels progresses, if slowly ; 180,000 tons of shipping is being built.   The production of pig iron was slightly increased
in November, and the prices, which are still at the maximum fixed by the &quot; Eisenwirtsohaftsbund&quot; in 1920, still allow very large profits, though fuel difficulties have considerably raised the cost of production. Tho profits are mostly used in enlarging the iron works, and the mines are being developed in order to increase tho yield and lessen the price of iron.A close union of the industrial establishments, in the direction of self-sufficiency, is proposed to meet tho threatening world-wide economic crisis. The banks are doing well, and are paying fairly good dividends. A number of important industrial companies are increasing their share capital.Russian Activities: Political and Military.Eiduk, head of the Russian military Chrosvychaika, was in Berlin in December buying arms and munitions, largely from &quot; Schieber.&quot; He has set up a general staff of agents who watch the Red soldiers interned in Germany, and all Russians living there, and practise political and military espionage. The chief agents are Kamietzki, commissary; Chernitzki, divisional chief ; Sussi, commissary ; Somine, major in the Red Army, and Major Gaya.Labour.The tendency, apparent since the revolution, of the Trades Unions to take on apolitical character, is reported to have been especially noticeable during the past few weeks. The workers are being indoctrinated with extreme theories, but opinions as to the success of this propaganda differ. It is said on the one hand that the Communists are steadily capturing the Trade Union machinery ; on the other that the Communist cells, which have been formed iuto formal fractions inside &quot;the Unions, are too nnin-fluential to accomplish anything, and are looked upon by the workers as the mere &quot; sabotage &quot; columns, which in fact they are. The cells inside the old Independent Socialist Party had more success, but the present Independent Socialist Party should be able to protect itself. Moscow is now reported to have instructed the Communist Labour Party to form cells inside the unified Communist Party, and to preserve the revolutionary vigour of the new party, which appears to be a house divided against itself. There is a movement of return towards tho Independent Socialist Party on the part of many of those who voted for Moscow and left it, and the Independent Socialist Party is much more homogeneous. Moscow&apos;s chief interest is to fuse the Communist Labour Party and the Communist Party which have their own underlying difficulties and dimensions. The Communist Labour Party delegate, William Schroeder, has gone to Moscow, where ho will take part in the Conference of the Executive Committee with a deliberative vote,In the case of the threatened railway strike the Government has consented to negotiate with the workmen as distinct from the officials  through the Ministry of Transport. This is looked upon as an attempt to break the recent alliance between workers and officials. There are indications that a strike policy is not universally favoured, but there is a movement, chiefly among* the workmen, to repudiate the recognised leaders, and to set up new committees in favour of a strike. The demands of the railwaymen are embarrassing the Government. The unions have amalgamated and repudiated the recent settlement.Some influential circles are said to be suggesting that the various political and industrial conferences should be transferred to the Rhine-
land, and especially to Cologne, as correctives to the activity of tho Rhenish Home Rulers and the influence of the Allied occupation.Miscellaneous.An organisation called the &quot; Union for the Assistance of Officers and Officials of the Old Russian Army&quot; has been formed in Germany, There is a similar union in Paris in touch with I he monarchist centre in Berlin.A movement is on foot to co-ordinate Indian activities in Europe by means of a kind of Central Executive Committee, tho members of which will he distributed to the various European centres. The first meeting will he held in Germany, when members will be elected and their centres of activity apportioned.A translation of the joint pastoral letter issued in October by the Irish Roman Catholic bishop is to be circulated as Irish propaganda in Germany.The American National City Bank, which undertook Martens&apos; affairs in America, and has close relations with Vauderlip, is opening a branch in Hamburg. This branch will foster American trade with. Germany, and will finance Soviet deals in Hanseatic towns.SWITZERLAND.Extremists.An International conference of Socialist parties which have left the Second International, but which have not yet joined tho Third, was held at Berne during December. These Centrists, thinking that neither the Second nor the Third International can bring about the Social revolution, decided to ask the proletarians of the world to form an all-inclusive Socialist International. They denounced the Communist International as &quot;deliberately working to shatter all Socialist parties which do not unresistingly submit to its dictation.&quot; They declared that the dictator-ship of the proletariat is a necessary state of transition, but each country should decide the individual form of the dictatorship. Eventually the council decided by 274 votes to nine that the working classes shall exercise their political power under the form of a dictatorship of the proletariat. They agreed to exclude from the party all Communists and all persons intending to promote action against the Socialist Party or the Trade Unions. Meanwhile the ballot of the executive of the Swiss Socialist Party upon the acceptance or rejection of Lenin&apos;s 21 points has ended in their rejection by 4-1 sections of the party.Tho extremists in Zurich, as elsewhere, are reported to be working at infusing their ideas into the minds of school children and young people.The efforts of the &quot; Volksrecht&quot; at fomenting class hatred do not seem to be meeting with great success. Thus at Honegg a workmen&apos;s meeting declined class warfare and the demands of their extremist section.Extremists have been studying a plan for the seizure of the factories by the workers, after the Italian fashion, but it is reliably reported that there is no immediate prospect of this plan materialising. The move-ment should, however, be watched.Bratman-Brodovski, one of tho more pestilent members of Kopp&apos;s Delegation in Berlin, has been in the running against Platten for the Trade Mandate in Switzerland. It appears, however, that Kopp is afraid to take steps to obtain a German visa for him to go there in view of a more than probable refusal by the German authorities, when Bratman-BrodovskPs position in Berlin as a member of the delegation would be
seriously compromised. Krassin is to discuss Bratman-Brodovski&apos;s appointment as trade representative to Switzerland in Moscow.A leading police authority in Switzerland, speaking recently on crime in the country, traced an intimate and curious connection between persons holding Bolshevik ideas and moral perversion and spiritualism.Oriental Intrigue.The two most important Persian intriguers in Switzerland are Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, who lives at Geneva, and Mahmud Afshar, who lives at Lausanne. The anti-English and Germanophile Moukson Khan Rais, who was removed from his appointment as secretary of the Persian Legation at Berne, is now studying at Geneva. Ho is not in liaison with the Control Committee in Berlin.The Persian revolutionary movement in Southern Switzerland appears to centre in Moukscn Khan, who is in touch with Dr. Mushir, a leading Persian Nationalist. The pair have no personal means, but draw Boishevik funds from Zurich. They appear to work Avith tho Turkish Nationalists, and to correspond with Persia through Turkish channels. There is no activity at present among Persian Nationalists in Switzerland.AUSTRIA.The Internal Situation.Events during tho mouth have been symptomatic of the general deliquescence of government and society in Austria. Reports have multiplied that the Government had announced to the Entente that it Avas at the end of its resources and no longer in a position to carry on. The one hope was that something favourable might result from the -negotiations proceeding in Paris. It Avas felt that no policy of doles or tinkering with the situation would suffice. Only a clear policy, con-sistently applied, could meet the critical situation. State employees and railwaymen are said to make a solid demand for union with Germany.Meanwhile strikes have multiplied, and vehement demands have been made for the corporal and even the capital punishment of profiteers. There have been Communist demonstrations against the great Ring hotels and cafe houses. The last development Avas the postal strike, turning little on pay, but chiefly on status. The Socialists demanded that postal employees should have the character of State officials ; the Christian Socialists and Pan-German officials that they should be con-sidered as employees of State enterprises. A sympathetic strike of telephone and telegraph employees followed. The matter was finally settled by the Government agreeing to alter tho laAv regulating the conditions of service for postal employees, and the public Avas left hurt and bcAvildered.The Reconstruction International.The Congress of the &quot; Tavo and a Half International&quot; will be held in Vienna next month, and Avill seek to mediate between the Second and the Third. Its success depends upon Iioav far its supporters are able to avoid being drawn to one Wing or the other. From the point of view of pure opposition to the Third International it is perhaps desirable that they should be draAVn rather to the Left than to the Right, a valid reason for this appearing to be that Lenin himself Avould rather have it the other Avay. The Congress is confined to parties which have left the Second International and do not Avish to join the Third. The provisional constitution and statutes have been issued.   These prescribe methods of
class warfare, and inculcate direct action as tho weapon against bourgeois attempts to interrupt democratic progress by violence. The Vienna Congress has for task to organise internationally the action which is to culminate in the social revolution. A preliminary meeting to make arrangements for the Conference is to be held at Innsbruck. Wallhead is to be the delegate from England.The Communists.The results of the elections for the Workmen&apos;s Councils indicate so far a reverse for the Communists. In Vienna Communists, Socialist Labour Party, and POale Zionists together obtained about 7 per cent, of the seats against tho Social Democrats&apos; 92 per cent. The Communists themselves only polled 277 votes to the Socialists&apos; 4,225.The Hungarian refugees are leaving Vienna, officially on account of the attitude towards them of the new Government; really it would appear on account of the distrust between the various sections of the party. Lenin&apos;s attitude is said to have much to do with this rivalry and ill-feeling. The Hungarians, who, while they ruled, spoke on equal terms with Lenin, he now contemptuously calls &quot; tho teething babies of the Communist Party,&quot; a designation they share with the Dutch Com-munists, the most perfect of theorists. The teething babies are at least in sympathy with one another. Lukacs favours the Dutch, because they, the Hungarians and Comrade Sylvia Pankhiirst in England, are just now more or less banned by Moscow. Lenin, whose conciliatory methods they have defied, thinks them too slavish followers of Karl Marx, and has described their ideas o? the Red Terror as positively boring. Lenin recently ridiculed the articles sent by Bela Kun to Vienna. Bela Kun, very angry, went round to see Lenin, but he left him quite tamed, cancelled his articles, and sent new ones showing that he had turned from orthodox Marxism to the Lenia-Levi-Lania policy.The straits to which the Vienna Communists are reduced are illustrated by recent negotiations between Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, whose &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; is also in dire need, and Lukacs from whom she sought support for it. Comrade Liikaes had to explain to Comrade Pankhurst that a loan of 300/. from the Hungarian and Austrian Communists Party in Vienna was an absolute impossibility. The Vienna Communists are a party of refugees, living in abject misery on altogether inadequate funds from Russia. 300/. a small enough sum in London- represents in Vienna more than 500,000 crowns, more than enough to run their paper for four or five months, and enough to keep a whole colony of communists during mouths and months of hard work.. In the course of the discussion a note of despair was sounded ; &quot;There is no unity among Communists anywhere,&quot; declared Lnkacs, &quot; only party quarrels, distrust, and meanness of the worst kind.&quot;Anarchists.Certain of the anarchists, who are just no\v on the best of terms with the] Bolshevik Delegation in Berlin, are said to have had the Bolshevik wireless put at their disposal. They have bribed the operators and the men who decode in Vienna and Berlin, and get copies of all messages concerning themselves. Anarchists are spending their large funds on the reconstruction of their old secret service.Young Egyptians.There are reported to be some 70 Egyptian students in Vienna, all of them Nationalists. The student Omar Effendi Schauki is president of the &quot;Egyptian Society,&quot; which  appears  at present to have little
importance. The librarian of the Oriental Institute of the University, Dr. Johaun Sehnieisser, is a great helper of the Egyptian students. Ho is violently anti-British and has never failed to stir up both Egyptians and Indians, with results, however, disappointing to himself.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.The Communists.The month of January was a bad one for Communists in Czecho-ttlovakia. Early in tho month it was reported that the Government hail resorted to strong anti-Communist measures, trial by jury being abolished and special courts being established to try Communists who had been imprisoned.The Right Wing of the German Socialist Party within Czeoho-Slovakia has decided to exclude the Communists. This is an irreparable split in the ranks of the 300,000 Socialists in German Bohemia. Tho party machinery, however, including the official organ, &quot; Vorwaorts,&quot; published in Reichenberg, remains with tho Communists. The German Socialist Democratic Left in Reichenberg has, however, not given up the struggle for mastery and is bent on discovering definitely whether the party as a whole is ready to accept the 21 points and to support the foundation of an international Communist Party in Czecho-Slovakia. Members of this group argue that conditions are such that further delay or compromise is mere treachery.The Communists are dissolving the local committees in Kladno, Teplitz, and Kialupy, and replacing them by a communist department with its centre in Louny.Foreign Relations.The foreign situation in Czecho-Slovakia is reported to be favourable and even with Hungary no conflict is believed to be imminent. Dr. Beucs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, speaking in the National Assembly, uttered a note of warning with reference to the fanatical propaganda of the Magyars against Czecho-Slovakia. In the differing social structure of autocratic Hungary and democratic Czecho-Slovakia Dr. Benes foresaw difficulties in arriving at an agreement. He stated that not for a moment should the restoration of the Emperor Charles be considered, and that any movement in that direction would constitute a castes belli. This applied not only to Charles himself but to all members af the former Royal House, particularly Joseph.Dr. Benes Avas equally emphatic regarding the Poles, to whom he recommended greater caution in their relations with Hungary and a realisation of the loyalty of the Czecho-Slovak attitude. When Dr. Benes spoke the Polish Finance Minister had already expressed a desire for financial co-operation between Poland and Czecho-Slovakia. It appears, in fact, that the Poles have decided that, in view of the uncertainty of their relations Avith Russia and Germany, a policy of sustained hostility towards Czecho-Slovakia ouly increases Polish mortifications. As regards Russia, Dr. Benes declared himself in favour of a policy of non-intervention, based on the hope that Soviet propaganda for social revolution throughout Europe would be abandoned.Whether, however, all the goodwill of the Czecho-Slovaks will succeed in staving off a conflict with the Magyars is as yet by no means assured. The Magyars are said to have no intention of abandoning their designs on Slovakia or their incitations to Poland to join them in these plans. A Polish-Magyar-Slovakian League, under Avhich Slovakia will preserve its autonomy, is spoken of.   The plan apparently is to
form in Poland Magyar-Slovakian legions, largely recruited from the terrorist bands and under officers additional to the allowed strength of the Hungarian army. Sufficient arms are said to bo hidden on the Slovakian frontier.Jt was reported in December that stories of a Czech intrigue aiming at uniting East Galicia and the Russian Carpathians under Czech protectorship are disturbing Warsaw. A rumour that a part of Bukowina is involved is causing Bucharest to make inquiries. Eventual autonomy for East Galicia is suggested as a preventive of Czech intrigue.No very definite consequences of the recent visit of the British Labour leaders to Czecbo-Slovakia appear to be forthcoming. President Masaryk and the Social Democrats have a great belief in the moderation of British Labour politics, upon whose influence they rely for restraint upon the designs of the extreme Left everywhere. Indefinite, however, as any results of the relations established during the recent visit may be, the establishment of more intimate relations with moderate labour is believed none the less to have considerable importance in the eyes of the Czeeho-Slovakia leaders.Trebitsch Lincoln has left the Hotel Passage at Prague and is now at a private address, where the secret police are watching him. His son has joined him.   Lincoln is obviously under high protection.4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES.RUSSIA. The Peasants and the Bolsheviks.The peasant communities still remain the healthiest and most normal element in Soviet Russia. Here, where Communism is neither understood nor favoured, is the most dangerous opposition to the Bolsheviks. Lenin&apos;s attempted disintegration of the peasantry by classifying into poor, middle-rich, and &quot;graspers&quot; has not had great success. Even with the &quot; graspers &quot; (propertied peasants, village shop-keepers, keepers of wine shops, &amp;c.) whom they dislike, the rest will make common cause in their own interests. There is store of gold and silver in the villages, not stolen, but obtained by barter, and most of it buried for fear of the Bolsheviks. The land remains the peasants&apos; chief concern. Under the Bolsheviks be is only a sort of compulsory tenant, and he will not rest until he is the free and legal owner of his land. Hence the countless sporadic risings, which, the Bolsheviks check by disarming and dis-organising the peasants. In the Northern Governments, to their bitter subsequent regret, the peasants gave up most of their arms, believing that they were wanted against the Whites who were bringing the laud-owner with them; in the Southern Governments the peasants., kept their arms and now use them against the Communists.Most of the peasants still fear the Bolsheviks, except the Avomen, who rail openly at Communist orators, and stir up resistance to requisitions. There are some Communist guilds in the small country townships which, though they have been loaded with favours by the Government, and have the power of requisition, are not successful. Some of the members are . not Communist at heart, but are restrained by fear of the rod and of the never remote possibility of the &quot; Avail.&quot;The &quot;Green Oak&quot; Rising.The population of the half of White Russia occupied by the Bolsheviks Avas reported early in December to be so angry with the Soviets that the
latter dared not call a conference of local Soviets for fear of a vote against thp Soviet Government. The revolutionary military committee controls executive power in White Russia. Peasants, assembled in ,l Green Armies,&quot; had been rioting. The Soviet is said to have secretly ordered JofFe to tell the Poles that independent White Russia exists, but has agreed to federal Union with Russia.The so-called &quot; Green Oak &quot; rising in White Russia is said to be organised by the Polish landowners, and not to be an outcome of Balakho-vitch&apos;s military action, as SaviukofT suggests. The movement is small and will probably be short-lived. Delegates were in Warsaw on December 11th, well financed, not by Savinkoff, but by Polish societies, who hope to enlarge the rising considerably, with the secret help of the Polish Government. The societies work for the re-union of White Russia, Lithuania, and Ukrainia to Poland; they are materially assisting Zeligowski&apos;s movement, One society, the &quot; Komitet Ohrony Kresow,&quot; acts under PilsudskPs instructions.The Economic Position.The economic position of Russia from the Bolshevik point of view was tersely summed tip by Trotsky in December : &quot; As far as our econo-&quot; inic work is concerned and in some fields we have worked rather &quot; energetically to supply the Army it can be said that we have fleeced &quot; Russia economically in order to assure the existence and fitness of the &quot; Army. . . . Now our task is to rob Nature, in order to enrich the &quot; new Soviet Society.&quot;In December, shortage of fuel, which apparently had not been reckoned with, appeared to be upsetting the industrial plans of the Bolsheviks. Some of the largest engineering works had stopped, and others were on the verge of stopping. Most of the stocks of fuel have been taken by the Military and Naval Commissariats for heating barracks and for ships which were being reconstructed for burning wood fuel. Owing to shortage of firewood the Petrograd trains ceased running on December 20th, and the suburban train service has been drastically reduced. The inhabitants had no fuel at all, but bought stolen wood with extreme difficulty at 80,000 roubles per. sajen. A later report states that tho fuel situation is better, bat still anxious. The Government hopes to tide over until river navigation can be reopened. Success, however, depends on the condition of the fleet.The harvest, especially of forage, has failed. Hay is valued among the peasants at 11,000 to 12,000 roubles the pood ; a jug of milk costs 900 roubles and bread 500 roubles. Bread is given gratis to all work-men, as is other produce (of which there is none at present). Coloured paper money has quite depreciated, and is no longer accepted in payment in the villages.Though cotton from Turkestan is now reaching Moscow, and though the mills are working, the industry is faced by a shortage of workers, who, as in the case of other industries, have scattered over the country-side in search of food. The working population of the province of Moscow has, indeed, declined by nearly 50 per cent, for 1920, as against 1913. The drop is most severe for the workers doing non-military work. In 1919 there were employed in the province of Moscow 360,000 people, of Avhom 280,000 were doing non-military work. In 1920 there were only 192,000 workers, of whom 102,000 were in non-military occupation. The Bolsheviks&quot; propose a compulsory levy of peasants to replace the scattered workers.
The scarcity of workers and the unwillingness of forced labour on the part; of local inhabitants render slow tho building of railways in Russia. In addition, timber is the only building material obtainable, so that any railways constructed are only temporary, and existing railways have to be robbed of part of their tracks in order to build the new ones. Great energy is being shown on the construction of the Alexandrow Gai-Emba line at the Caspian Sea, which will serve naphtha transport. The Railway Administration Committee has plans for building 10,000 versts a year, chiefly in Northern Russia.The authorities admit that Krivoi Rog, the most important iron ore-producing region, lay idle during last year ; that the copper mines yielded almost nothing ; the production of plumbago was between 13 and 25 per cent, of the pre-war yield ; and the iron ore extracted only one-tenth of what was expected. There are only 9,000 out of 27,000 workers wanted in the Urals.A special effort, fairly successful, has been made in repairing engines and cars. The amount of naphtha produced during 1920 is not sufficient for the needs of Russia, let alone export; the production of coal also leaves much to be desired. An attempt is to be made to restart the Krivoi Rog Basin iron ore mines.Imports into Russia from April 18th to October 31st, 1920, amounted to 2,088,127 poods.The Moscow Food Society is determined to unite all bread-baking and proposes to establish three or four baking works in Moscow capable of turning out 750,000 poods of bread a day. It is endeavouring to obtain the latest type of bread-baking machines from England.The Congress of Soviets.The recent eighth all-Russian Congress of Soviets is reported to have been distinguished by a marked divergence of views between the Right Communists headed by Lenin and Lunacharsky, and the Left Communists headed by Zinovieff and Bukharin. Trotsky hovers between the two parties. Every effort was made to conceal these differences, which are, however, not likely to have serious consequences. The criticism of Bolshevik policy by the Menshevik, Dan, greatly influenced the Congress. Elaborate military precautions were taken against disorders.Speaking of concessions, Lenin quoted a non-party peasant who had said : &quot; We peasants are ready to starve for three more years, only do not sell Mother Russia for concessions.&quot; Lenin proceeded to defend concessions as a bait for capitalists and to say that the authorities had no right to refuse anything that would improve the condition of the people. &quot; Communism,&quot; he said, &quot; is Soviet authority plus electrification.&quot; The Menshevik, Dan, alluded to the ignoring of the constitution of Russia by the Soviet of Feople&apos;s Commissaries by passing important laws, such as those of concessions, without the knowledge of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. The Social revolutionary, Volsky, warned the Government of the danger of forcing millions of peasants to become all at once &quot; Collectivists.&quot;Foreign Propaganda and Aggression.The instructions for revolutionary propaganda on the &quot;Asiatic Front&quot; make interesting reading. They require the concentration of propaganda work exclusively in the hands of the organisers of political propaganda, and inculcate a Roman reverence for local rites and rituals, and a singular respect for the customs of every tribe, &quot; however great may be their divergencies from the ideas of Communism.&quot;   But it is.
hinted that other methods may follow revolution. Contact is to he avoided with groups and nuclei of tho Indian sector, consisting chiefly of the Indian Hill Tribes, on account of the exceptional caste and tribal animosities between tho Hindoos and tho Kurd and Persian border tribes. The local great are to be won by appeals to their sense of nationalism, and Europeans, especially Britishers, however firm their Communism, are to be distrusted.The collapse of Wrangel was followed by conferences at Moscow, at which, after Trotsky had spoken strongly against renewed war with Poland in the immediate future, Lenin declared that they would try to dismember Poland peacefully and would extend propaganda to the utmost. He called for the establishment of relations with Zagloul Pasha, tho head of the Young Egyptian Party, and tho energetic support of the Indian and Egyptian Nationalist movements. The present task was to keep the capitalist States in a constant state of unrest. Tchitcherin reported that no revolution was to be expected in France and England, and that in Italy tho revolutionary forces were scattering; Litvinoff reported that in Scandinavia popular movements, but not revolutions, wore possible.It is reported from a reliable Communist source that representatives of Communist parties in all countries surrounding Russia arrived in Moscow towards the end of January to discuss the military and political situations of the countries represented, how far each country was ready to meet the Russian Red Army half way should the Soviet Government decide upon military adventures in the spring of 1921. The strength and readiness of internal Communist organisations was especially reported upon.Representatives of the German Communist organisations declared that in case of tho Red Army advance to Posnay, that is to the frontier of 1914, German Communists would be obliged at that point to defend the soil of the fatherland.Polish, Hungarian, and Rumanian representatives positively declared that a Soviet attack upon Poland, Hungary, or Rumania in the spring would enable local Communists organisation to rebel and overthrow the governments of these countries. The Soviet Government is reported to be paying special attention to the strengthening and preparing for action of Communist organisations in Rumania. It is reported that Goldstein, the head of the Bolshevik press propaganda for Poland, has declared that, as was done in the Ukraine, the Soviet intends to subvert Poland from within and not from without.   Red Armies will he formed in Poland.It is reported that the Soviet Government, thanks to plans devised by Radek, has succeeded, in conveying to Switzerland 30,000,000 francs, to be used for propaganda in Switzerland, France, and Italy.Military Movements and Intentions.The reorganisation and demobilisation of the Red Army is the main question now engaging the attention of the Soviet Government.It is reported that the Red Military Commanders, together with Lenin and Trotsky, have decided to attack Poland in order to join up with Germany, to support German operations in Lithuania, and to attack. Latvia, Esthonia, and Finland in the spring of 1921, when it is hoped that propaganda will have demoralised the armies of these countries.Bolsheviks are reported to have accumulated a great store of war material in the neighbourhood of Smolensk.Certain indications gathered in London seem to confirm the idea of a reversion to the policy of military aggression in the spring&apos;.   (1) For
three weeks of January and tho first week of February Russian experts in London have been trying to buy motor bicycles everywhere. Orders are placed largely in Stockholm, but also here. These orders placed for bicycles instead of motor lorries, which might be of use for purposes of transport, appear strange. (2) Mr. Laugenberg, residing at the Victoria Hotel in London, representative of the Eastern Trailing Company, Stockholm, is buying all immediately available stocks of khaki, suoh stocks being of the weight of 23 ozs. Government standard. (3) Moscow is doing its utmost, behind Krassin&apos;s back, to start commercial negotia-tions with French firms in France, despite the fact that Germany, and oven England, could supply them with more goods under better conditions. The inference is that Moscow is endeavouring to exert influence through big French concerns to wreck the policy of the French Government in supporting Poland. (4) Krassin early in February sent a wire to tho Soviet Trade Delegation In London stopping the placing of any orders until further instructions. Now, after receiving the final draft of the trade agreement before his departure for Russia, although Krassin was somewhat pessimistic about the value of the agreement, he was certain that it would be signed without amendment, because he believed that the fact of the signing of a treaty between England and Soviet Russia would in itself lead to the establishment of commercial relations with America, France, and Germany, and in time also to political recognition. Krassin, however, as everything shows (the telegram included), is now meeting with much opposition, which, it is to be supposed, emanates from the section of Trotsky, Litvinoff&apos;, and Company in Moscow. The enmity of Krassin. at home has doubtless been accen-tuated by the recent intensification of his quarrel with Litvinoff&apos;, which is even reported to have gone the length of personal violence.The principal commissars in Moscow are, however, said to be alive to the dangers of a new Polish-Bolshevik war, which would bring about a new western anti-Bolshevik front. The Russian White troops are said to be more dangerous to the Bolsheviks than national troops, such as Polish, because the Red soldiers tend to desert to the White side.A shifting southwards of troops is reported. Most of the big reserves recently at Polock-Minsk are shifting to Tscherkassy. Elisabetgrad is the chief headquarters. Small local reserves are moving to Winniza, Uman, and Woznesensk, A simultaneous attack on Roumania and Georgia is apparently rejected. The Bolsheviks meditate joint action with the Kemalists to free the Black Sea, and hope to advance through Bessarabia and the Dobrudja to Varna. From Varna they will risk throwing some 2,000 men across the Black Sea to a point on the Anatolian coast well removed from Constantinople. In case of success the Kemalists will post towards Gallipoli, and the Bolsheviks to Adrianople through roumania and Bulgaria. The Kemalists will move on Georgia from Erivan and Kars ; the Bolsheviks from Baku and Telav, and, if necessary, from Petrovsk. The Bolshevik action is said to be aimed at the serious consequences to them of an agreement between roumania and Hungary, which is said to promise the return of certain territory on condition that she helps roumania against the Bolsheviks.A fantastic statement, sent out from Nauen to America, alleges that support is being won for international intervention in Russia to eradicate Bolshevism. An encircling movement upon Russia is being talked of, by joint British, French, and German armies, with Foch as commander-in-chief, and General Hoffman, and a British General as second chiefs. For her redemption Russia will pay 600,000,000 gold francs, with a special issue secured by concessions,, and the whole of Russia&apos;s natural
00oCresources. Tins sum is to bo divided proportionately between the inter-voniug powers, Germany having to use what she gets for paying for French reparation. Ludendorff is said to consider the plan impossible of realisation, and to object that it calls upon Germany to shed blood to pay Franco, and that it will create long-standing enmity between Russia and Germany. He favours instead Americau-Gcrman-Russian economic co-oporation.The Moscow Military Council; December 1920.The argument of the foregoing section is supported (by a report just received from a specially reliable source with regard to certain military councils held in Moscow in December.While tho 8th Congress was being held in December at Moscow a series of military councils took place at Lonin&apos;s residence, at which tho Supreme Military Council, tho Council of Commissaries, and tho pre-siding members of the Pan-Russian Executive Committee assisted.The discussions lasted three days and were kept very secret. Kanienieff (Commandor-in-Chief of tho Red Armies), BrussilofF, and Trotsky were the principal speakers. Tho principal subject of discussion was a very detailed report by Trotsky on the position of the Army with reforence to the internal and external situation of Soviet Russia, the chief points of which were : (1) The internal situation and especially her economic position are so bad that tho Soviet Government may see itself obliged to start another war.(2) Tho conclusion of peace with-Poland must be delayed as much as possible. Should Poland decide to make peace, this must only be an interlude. *(3) The Red Army must be at least 2.000,000 strong and composed of men devoted to the Soviet Government.(4) The Supreme Military council has ordered the erection of aero-plane factories at Charkov, Saratov, Nicolaiew, and Kiew, which are already working and giving satisfactory results, with the help of German and Russian technical experts and workmen. The dockyards at JNloolaieff will soon be able to launch three submarines, and thanks to Kopp&apos;s negotiations with German naval engineers and officers, their capacity will probably be increased before long. Artillery has been ordered in Finland, Lithuania, and Germany. Arms and munitions fell into the hands of the Bolsheviks after the defeat of Wrangel.(5) The organisation of the Bolshevik espionage service abroad is extraordinarily efficient.(6) Propaganda in the East and in the Caucasus must be continued. In Rumania it should be greatly increased, as Bessarabia could serve as a pretext for war. Lithuania and Georgia must serve as exercise grounds for the Bolshevik armies in the event of war with Poland or in the East. Latvia, Esthonia, and Finland must be kept in awe in spite of their protestations of friendship, and the Red frontier garrisons must be rein-forced.   The line of the Dniester must be consolidated and* Note by Db ectorate of Intelligence. This statement of policy would appear to be confirmed by reports emanating from the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Joffe is playing for time at Riga. The Poles note that he is playing his hand with great finesse, and that his whole game is obscure. It is evident to them that he is playing a game and playing it consistently.
the troops concentrated in such a way that they can easily penetrate into Rumania. The Bolshevik centres and secret organisations in Lithuania, Georgia, Bessarabia, and Turkestan must be trebled, and no expense spared to prepare the ground by means of native Bolshevik elements.(7) Everything must bo done to avoid a break with Germany, this being the only country whose relations with Soviet Russia are correct, and whose importance as a purveyor of arms and munitions must be considered.(8) There must bo no relaxing of Bolshevik propaganda in the Polish army or in Poland itself. The secret funds assigned to Poland must be increased.Trotsky&apos;s roport gave rise to violent discussions. All the soldiers Avero on Trotsky&apos;s side, whereas Lenin, Tchitcherin, and Kalinin wero of opinion that to accept without discussion Trotsky&apos;s proposals would bo in direct opposition to tho peace resolution adopted by tho Congress.In the end, however, Trotsky&apos;s plans were passed, with some modifications, and obtained the sanction of the Sovnakom and of the new Fan-Russian Executive Committee,The Ukraine.The signature of a military and economic convention between the Russian and the Ukrainian Soviet Republic is reported. The two States are to have joint commissaries for national defence, foreign affairs, finance, &amp;c.There are still peasant insurrections in the Ukraine, but tho only military body remaining is one in the neighbourhood of Old Koustanty-now, consisting of some 8,000 men.   Petlura may possibly go to France.Anti-Bolshevik Movements.Savinkoff is reported to be just now the only possible leader of the anti-Bolshevik movement which is probable next spring. All Russian parties and the Polish General Staff seem to back him, but he would appear not to be in good odour at present with the French. Savinkolt&apos;s difficulty is financial, though he is reported to have had 200,000,000 marks quite lately, probably from the Polish General Staff. He thinks of appealing for funds through the English press, and means to organise in the spring an anti-Bolshevik rising, starting with 15,000 men, now interned in Poland, headed by Balakhovitch. Savinkoff wants 100,000/. for propaganda and equipment.Since Wrangel&apos;s collapse there may be said to be no official anti-Bolshevik representation abroad. The French Government is much troubled by WrangeFs interned troops, aud the question of Russian policy seems to have caused the rift between the Ministry of War and the Foreign Office. Kerensky continues to organise a conference of members of the former Constituent Assembly, apparently with the object of asserting his own predominance. He possesses large funds and con-siderable support, in Masonic circles. His programme is said to be the overthrow of Bolshevism by revolts amongst the peasantry and the Red Army and by terrorist acts. SavinkofTs prospects cannot be accurately determined. He is still in Poland among his interned troops. He is said to hope that Bolshevik aggression will unite Poland, Finland,, the Border States, and possibly Bumania, into a force Avhich will finally destrov thd Soviet.Members of the old Russian Constituent Assembly have met in Paris and; considered a programme for the deliverance of Russia.   They oppose0  AS 8671 P
any blockade by tho Allies and favour the resumption of foreign trade with Russia.It is credibly reported that the Central Committee of tho Social Revolutionary Party in Moscow has founded a department, ready, if necessary, to murder the members of the Sovnakom, and is now engaged on a plan for arresting all the members. The committee managed to seduce some of the Lettish sharpshooters, but the Chresvychaika discovered this and transferred most of them elsewhere.The Mcnsheviks and the Bund are giving up the fight against the Bolsheviks who are now opposed only by the Social Revolutionaries and the Anarchists, both relentlessly attached. It is difficult to discover whether or not the Monarchists are behind the Anarchists. The Social Revolutionaries work hard, and continue the issue of their paper &quot; Semlia i Vola,&quot; of which the Bolsheviks cannot discover the place of publication,Trade with Great Britain.Considerable differences appear in the text of the Trade Agreement with Great Britain as published, in the English press, and described by the Board of Trade as that of the document handed to M. Krassin before his departure for Moscow ; and that of the draft issued by the Russian Trade Delegation, &quot;as presented by the Russian Delegation to Sir Robert Home.&quot; The main differences lie in the Preamble and in Clauses V. and IX. Thus, the Russian version of the Preamble has no reference to the passages in the British version regarding the encourage-ment of Asiatic against British interests in the British Empire ; the Russian version of the preamble also asks for the reference of questions of interpretation to a special conference to be called after the signing of the agreement. Clause V. claims for Russian agents the privileges accorded under the Diplomatic Privileges Act of 1705. The Russian draft of Clause IX. contains a supplementary paragraph, claiming a general licence for agents of the Soviet to export from time to time Russian gold from Great Britain, but giving Great Britain the option (to be exercised within seven days) of purchasing the gold at the open market price.Krassin, who is now in Moscow, states that the differences between Great Britain and Russia have arisen owing to the British refusal to guarantee unconditionally the inviolability of Soviet property in Great Britain. Krassin looks forward to trade with America after a treaty between Rnssia and Great Britain is concluded. He thinks that trade exchange with Western countries depends upon the creation of a great stock of goods for export.Although German prices are invariably lower than British prices, and the Germans are willing to accept easier terms, the Bolsheviks prefer to obtain goods from the United Kingdom as their merchandise is better and always up to sample, which is rarely the case with German products. Germans are content to accept a deposit of 20 per cent, on signing the contract, and the remainder on receipt of the goods ; they will also accept payment in Russian gold. The British terms arc much more severe, the expense in connection with the sale of gold and transfer of credits to London has to be reckoned with in quoting with the Bolsheviks. A total of 7 per cent, may be considered as the amount required to cover this.The Soviet Government^ order for locomotives to Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth, and Company is believed not to be of great importance to
Russia from an economic standpoint, and to have been given from political motives. Its announcement was a distinct political score for tho Russians. The contract was that Messrs. Armstrong should repair locomotives, 250 the first year, and increasing in number yearly. Tho contract, however, is understood to contain so many phases that the Russians will easily be in a position to wriggle out of it. From a comraer-cial point of view Russia simply cannot afford to spend gold for paying freight to England and back. Her gold reserve^, as we note elsewhere, have fallen to 65,000,000/. The payment of the high wages of British workmen and the freight of the locomotives makes tho price of these repairs far greater than they would be if done in Germany or even in Russia. If it were a question of now locomotives the matter would be different, but to send locomotives to England and back again for a few hundred pounds worth of repairs appears to the Russian exports ridiculous. It is clear, therefore, that some other motives must have been at work, and it is believed that the order, once its immediate political object has been attained, will probably be treated as most orders are by the Soviet Government when they see a way to quibble themselves out.Trade Notes.Members of a Bolshevik Trade Delegation recently arrived in Constantinople include M. T. Kuznotzov, who declares that his mission is purely commercial. He seems anxious to arrange trade between foreign firms, preferably British, and Bolshevik Black Sea ports. He is believed to possess substantial guarantees and to be authorised to grant concessions. His anxiety to get into touch with Turkish circles and his interest in the disposition of Russian refugees and soldiers in Constanti-nople tend to belie his &quot;trade&quot; intentions.In consequence of the Sagor judgment the despatch of ply wood to Reval from Russia has been stopped, and early in January the Soviet authorities were negotiating with Sagor regarding the deal.The Soviet Railway Mission in Sweden has stated that the Swedish firms are willing to execute the railway orders on the same conditions as tho Germans, and that the orders must therefore be placed with them.On au agreement with Lomonosoff, Hugo Stinnes is reported to have sent a deputation to Russia, on whose report he will accept or refuse the general concession for the installation of electricity in Russia.Traffic in Gold.It is reported from an inside source that the reserves of gold remaining in Russia amount to 65 millions and the reserve of platinum to 3^ tons.Since August 20th of last year the Bolsheviks are said to have sent 62,000,000 Swedish crowns abroad. On November 8th, 1,000 cases of gold, weighing 3,000 poods, were sent to Esthonia for the purchase of goods abroad. Some 40 per cent, of the total sum is supposedly used for propaganda,   25 per cent, consists of inferior metals.A communication to Moscow from the Trade Delegation at Stockholm, dealing with the gold question, states that the United States is at present the only country with a gold rate of exchange, and only there is a sale of gold according to the present price possible, Gold must, however, be handed over to the United States Treasury ; Russian gold is boycotted and its import forbidden, and every gold importer must prove the non-Russian origin of the metal. This is the reason for the low price of gold, which has to pass through many speculators, who know how to hide its origin.   It is pointed out that the release of small quantities of
gold by insignificant people does not increase its value, and only increases the cost of Russian purchases, It is accordingly advised that tho realisation of gold abroad before its importation into America should be in one person&apos;s baud and should be carried out with the aid of one largo institution,Meetings and Conferences.The first International Conference of Revolutionary Trade Unions has been convenod for May 1st. The special International Commission consists of llosmor (France), Lozovski (Russia), Bela Kun (Hungary), and Shaflin (Bulgaria).The tenth Bolshevik Party Congress is postponed to the March 6th ; the Congress of the Women of the East has been postponed until April 1st in view of the pending Party Congress.Another &quot; Week of the Peasant&quot; is being arranged, with the difficult object of convincing the suspicious peasants that the workmen of the towns are really their comrades in labour.Moscow notifies a special &quot;fortnight&quot; throughout Russia, beginning on January 15th, with the object of strengthening and expanding Communism.At its third Congress, the Russian Union of Communist Youth decided that an All-Russian re-registration should take place from February 20th to March 15th. The Union is also considering questions of discipline, such as deliberate refusal to take part in the work, and desertion. When re-registration is over, there will be a week for strengthening union work.Miscellaneous.Not physical starvation only, but still more intellectual starvation, is reported to have driven what remains of the intelligentsia to a genuine wish to work for the Soviet. No book or newspaper is published in Russia except those of the Soviet; hence general ignorance of what is happening. &quot; The continuous struggle for existence and the clandestine &quot; methods which simply must be utilised to get food have so completely &quot; changed the psychology of Russian men and women that they are &quot; unrecognisable.&quot;It is reported that the Council of People&apos;s Commissaries has appointed Theodore Rothstein chairman of a Commission &quot; for the radical revision of the instruction in social sciences throughout the universities of the Russian Republic,&quot; i.e., a kind of director of &quot; political education.&quot; Later, when the Commission has done its work, Rothsteiu goes to Persia as Bolshevik Envoy.It is stated that Soviet employees who are foreign subjects have had to make known the addresses abroad of their families, such relatives being the best means for secret Communist work outside Russia. The relatives of Trotsky&apos;s Lettish Guards and of the Lettish Communist Party in Moscow are receiving special attention.All Custom Houses of the Soviet Republic appear to have been authorised to confiscate all foreign money from citizens landing in Russia, and to repay them according to the value in roubles established by the Deputy of. the People&apos;s Commissariat for Finance.In order to meet obstruction in the departments, some of which refuse to supply information at all, the authorities of the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Trade are now holding heads of departments and sections personally responsible for neglect.
Bloch, president of the Union of Artists, dias boon shot by the Bolsheviks. He was arrested two months ago on suspicion of being in touch with persons abroad.Makhno, who is now a fugitive, lias been condemned in default. A strong anti-Makhno propaganda has been ordered by the Soviet.The corruption engendered by Soviet rule is instanced by the arrest of 58 persona connected with the fuel provision section of the Commis-sariat for Popular Economy on charges of misconduct in the performance of their duties. These include Machrovsky, second in command of the section, the whole engineering staff, and the whole of the control personnel.At Azoff a public trial has been hold of tho illiterate members of Trade Unions. The accused were sentenced conditionally, if failing to learn within a stated period, to eight years1 compulsory labour.According to Moscow the Soviet authorities in Turkestan are fighting hard against illiteracy, and religious superstition. Their chief weapon appears to be 6,000 A B C&apos;s in the Uzbeck language, and 5,000 in the Kirghiz.Six echelons of American workmen, each numbering 200 to 250 persons, have reached Petrograd and Moscow. Most of them are Jewish Russian emigrants, who went to America to escape conscription. They are said to have been well received, and to have been supplied with better food and even firewood.According to the &quot;Pravda&quot; the Soviet has officially pronounced that the dictatorship of the Russian proletariat applies also to the world of science. The &quot;Izvestia&quot; declares that only orthodox Revolutionary Marxists, recommended by the Local Soviets, will be admitted to the Universities as professors of History and Jurisprudence.Moscow reports that a postal agreement is being negotiated with Germany in the name of Russia and in that of the Governments of Ukraine, Bessarabia, Azerbaijan, and the Far Eastern Republic.A union is proposed between the Communist Party and the Jewish Bund.The sinister activities of Eiduk have led to his expulsion from Germany, after a vain protest by Kopp to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Moscow, indeed, instructed Kopp not to protest further, and to let Eiduk go.FINLAND.Communism.In Finland, as elsewhere, the Communists appear to be divided. The Finnish Party was founded at the beginning of 1920 by one Kaarlo Luoto, who heads the Eastern group, which is Bolshevik, in direct touch with Russia and working for revolution, with headquarters at Kuopio. The more moderate group has two departments Helsingfors and Yakobstadt, the Helsingfors department, headed by Sulo Vuolijoki, communicating with Russia via Reval. One Eino Pekkala is charged with the Communist office, and with working with foreign Communists via Sweden and Norway. There seem to be plans for sending Finnish Communists gradually to England, as engineers and stokers on Scaudi-scandinavian boats.General Mannerheim is reported to have declared that the danger of Bolshevism is past for Finland. The authorities are stronger; Govern-rnent troops quelled a Red rising at Bjyneborg on January 15th. The trouble is not expected to spread. Under the protection of the Schutz Corps the authorities can confidently engage in constructional work.
Relations with Russia.The Finnish delegates who went to Moscow to exchange ratifications of the Peace Treaty have returned from their carefully stage-managed tour.   Tchitcherin was profuso in his assurances of friendship.The Finnish Government has consented to accept Behrsin as the official representative of the Soviet Government. In this connection a party of Bolshevik emissaries arrived on the frontier and were placed in quarantine, which led Tchitcherin to recall them to Russia. Behrsin is of Lettish origin, has travelled from Moderate Socialism to Bolshevism, and in 1919 was a member of the Soviet Government of Latvia.Information has, however, reached Norway that the Soviet Govcrn-ment has informed the Finnish negotiators that it will not ratify the Peace Treaty unless Litvinoff becomes official diplomatic representative, with residence at Helsiugfors, and unless Russia receives transit traffic concessions. Litvinoff is to be the connecting link between Russia and tho world, and he is to organise international trade with Russia. In connection with tho appointment of litvinoff to Rcval, it is believed that Goukovsky will be head of the Bolshevik Delegation at Ilelsingfors which will consist of about 150 persons.Moscow reports that State Councillor Ahouon has been appointed Finnish Ambassador in Moscow.German Activities.There appear to be in Finland two main German espionage and propaganda organisations. One is the Deutsch-Finnische Verein, which is open to anyone definitely German in sentiment, and which may be said to include the great bulk of the intellectual, financial, and business world of Finland. The other society is the Finlandskampfer, working under the wing of the other organisations, and made up of past fighters for the liberty of Finland, who are ready to fight again at their own expense should Germany or Finland need them. Ludcndorff is president of this society in Germany, and Major Mauritz Gripeuberg in Finland. Head-quarters are at Potsdam. Honorary members include Hindenburg, Tirpitz, von der Goltz, and von Hintze.A considerable influx of German -workmen, principally mechanics, is reported into Finland. They are considerably better paid than thq Finnish workmen.Baltic States. LATVIA.Interior conditions grow worse, and the Russian Communists appear to have got some way towards their aims of increasing strikes, setting up Bolshevik Committees in important works, and undermining army discipline by planting Bolsheviks among the soldiers. The Government can do nothing, having to placate the Social Democrats, atid knowing that the expulsion of any members of the Furstenberg-Ganetsky Mission would mean the end of relations with Soviet Russia. The mission would appear to be a centre of active propaganda. The Government has asked the Soviet representative why Bolshevik troops are con-centrated on the frontier, and has been informed that the troops arc there in case of a Polish attack on Lithuania. The people feel the powerlessness of the^government, but memories of Bolshevik rule are sufficient to prevent a revolution, unless one is brought about with the help of the Soviet Government. - &apos; *;
A Lettish Communist nucleus, headed by Lazess, a well-known Lettish Communist, has been formed in Moscow to bring about a Soviet government in Latvia by force that is, by a war with Soviet Russia. Trotsky is the chief support of the Lettish Communists, particularly of the Lettish Communist &quot;nuclei,&quot; with which Lazess has planted the Red Army.The Lettish Socialists have abandoned the Second International, but have decided not to join the Third. They dream of a United revolutionary International.The &quot; Volia,&quot; which had just started to appear as a daily paper, with a subsidy of 250,000 roubles a month from the Soviet Mission, has been suppressed officially for publishing provocatory news, and its nominal editor, Grodeusky, has been imprisoned. The Riga branch of the Rosta supplied the paper with foreign telegrams.ESTHONIA.The result, now known in detail, of the recent elections, goes to prove that proximity to Communism is a remedy against it. The Government did not try to influence the elections, and there is no doubt that the results express national feeling. The Communist section of the Left Party polled only 5 per cent, of the total number of votes, against 30 per cent, in 1917 ; the Independent Party increased their percentage from 6 per cent, to 11 per cent, at the expense of the Social Democrats, who have dropped from 33 per cent,, of the total number of votes to IS per cent. Tho total representation of the Left has decreased from 41 per cent, to 34 per cent. The Centre, or Labour Party polled 22 per cent, of the total vote, and the Right increased their vote from 34 per cent, to 44 per cent., at the expense of the Nationalists. Tho Centre Party is individually the strongest. The general result will probably be a movement to the right and a Coalition government of the Right and the Centre, with a programme of rural economies.Communist Propaganda.It is reported that Esthouian Communists have decided to unite and work under the leadership of the Third International. In order to support the Soviet authorities it is suggested that workmen should be secretly armed and formed into a Red Army. A steady increase of agitation and propaganda is reported. New secret printing presses are to be opened at Reval.It is reported that 800,000 Czar roubles have been expended in propaganda and agitation in the Pechersk and Isborsk districts. In Narva and district there are eight secret Bolshevik sections.The steamer &quot; Wasa,&quot; which arrived at Reval from Stettin on October 20th, was found to be carrying large quantities of arms and ammunition, and of Bolshevik literature intended for Western Europe. Tho Esthonian authorities confiscated the cargo and arrested the captain of the steamer.Russian Activities.The appointment of Litvinoff as representative of Soviet Russia in Esthonia in place of Gukovsky and Solomon, representatives of tho Foreign Office and the Foreign Trade Office respectively, has been notified by the Soviet Government. This appointment indicates that Reval has now taken the&apos;place formerly held by Copenhagen as the centre abroad of Russian foreign policy.   Litvinoff arrived in Reval on
3rd January. It is uncertain whether Gukovsky will remain or whether he will he transferred to llelsingfors as head of the mission there.As if to accentuate the political nature of LitviuofFs mission it is reported that the secret service in Esthonia is being entrusted to the executive organ of the &quot; Politpodotdiel&quot; (political subsection) of the Bolshevik Trade Delegation. Aboldin, a member of the Extraordinary Commission, is reported to be at the head of the service, which, besides its permanent staff, has over 150 secret agents.Soviet activity in Esthonia is reported to divide itself into subversive organisation and propaganda work, undertaken by the Secret Esthonian Communist Party, of which the chief members are Victor Kingisepp, Ligemets, and Ryastas ; aud the collecting of political and military information. The organisation of groups throughout tho country has lately been given much attention.The Russian Social Revolutionaries are said to be secretly enlarging their work. They are well supplied with funds from Germany and from Govronsky in England. Much agitation is going on among the ex-officers and soldiers of the north-west Army. The organisation would appear to be anti-British and pro-German.The Russian &quot; White Cross&quot; organisation, which was formed last September, ostensibly to assist Russians arriving or resident in Esthonia, is mostly led by extreme Monarchists and is patronised by the Baltic Barons&apos; Party in Esthonia. It is in contact with Berlin, whence it-receives instructions by courier from A. J. Guchkov, who also controls a &quot; White Cross &quot; organisation in Latvia.LITHUANIA.Communist Movements and Propaganda.Pro-Bolshevism is reported to be increasing among the town workers. The landowners are still being persecuted, to their virtual expulsion from Lithuania. Peasants who own land are firmly anti-Bolshevik, but, while they favour Lithuanian independence, are undeveloped politically. Peasants who have little or no land are busied with thought of land distribution and are largely pro-Bolshevik. They, too, are undeveloped politically. The working-class movement, supported by labourers working for the peasant proprietors, is said to-be expanding and gaining in boldness. The party organisation is maintained by compulsory coutribu-tions from the workers.Bolshevik propaganda, helped on, it would appear, by the local Soviet Mission, has its centre in Shantzy, an artisan suburb of Kovno. Though apparently not very successful it is also noticeable in the army. The police do not interfere for fear of making difficulties between the Soviet Mission and the government. Soviet couriers consequently bring a vast amount of Bolshevik propaganda, mainly from Germany. A new local Communist paper called &quot; Borba &quot; (Battle) has appeared. There is no proof so far of the rumoured Bolshevik subsidies.A Bolshevik secret organisation, centred at Poneve/Ji and Vilkomir, was discovered by the Lithuanians during December. Joint work against Bolshevism and secret organisations in general seems likely to be under-taken by the Lettish and Lithuanian counter-espionage.Political.Some improvement in the feeling towards England is reported, but the press remains anti-English.
People show some interest at the continued hostilities on tho Polish-Lithuanian front. Public opinion was concerned over the question of Vilna, the fate of which was thought to depend rather upon the Bolsheviks than upon the League of Nations. There was talk of a forthcoming offensive from Central Lithuania against Kovno. Reservists of all years up to 25 are being secrotly mobilised.Axelrod is said to have foreshadowed the extinction of Lithuania should Poland beat the Soviet; its independent federation with Russia and conversion to Bolshevism should Russia conquer Poland.Axelrod is said to have reported to the Soviet Government that Lithuania is afraid of Russia and of the Poles, and that the Lithuanian Government has concluded a secret treaty with the Russian White Government, the head of which is Lastovski. Lastovski has been given 1,000,000 marks to stir up the White Russian peasants against both Poles and Bolsheviks. The German Government is also supporting Lastovski materially and financially against Poland. Axelrod still advises support of Lithuania as the easiest field of battle against Poland.In an interview early in December Dr. Purickis, the Lithuanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, declared that on no account would the Lithuanian Government agree to a plebiscite in Vilna. Dr. Purickis maintained that Zeligovski&apos;s raid had been planned by Warsaw. At the same time he distrusts Russian help, pointing out that if the Reds occupy Vilna they will never willingly leave it. He appears to fear Russian designs on Lithuania, and is convinced that there is as yet no possibility of permanent peace between Russia and Poland.It is alleged that Mr. Thomas Naruszevicz, the new Lithuanian Charge dAffaires in London, who represented the Lithuanians during the peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks in Moscow and Riga, seems to favour an alliance of Lithuania with the Bolsheviks. A Lithuanian dele-gation is even said to be now in Moscow discussing terms. Baron Freiderich von der Ropp and J. Gabrys, of Lausanne, are reported to be working the German-Jewish end of the scheme.The Jews.Bourgeois Lithuanian Jews are divided into Orthodox and Zionists, the latter the strongest Jewish party in Lithuania. They favour an in-dependent Lithuania, with Vilna as capital ; demand national and cultural autonomy for the Jews ; are pro-English, and support British policy in Lithuania. The Socialist Jews are chiefly workmen and young people, and are divided into the groups of Poale Zion, which has views not unlike those of the Third International, and the &quot; Bund,&quot; which favours the nationalisation of property. Both groups have pro-Russian and anti-Entente sympathies.POLAND.Communist Movements.After two years of effort the Communist attempt to capture the peasants may be said to have failed. The OAvnership of land by the peasants, the influx of moneyed peasants from America, Who have been fighting Com-communism, and experience of Bolshevik occupation are among the factors of the failure. On economic questions the workers can, however, be stirred. The Communists anticipate that the emigration of Jews from Russia to Poland one Jewish newspaper speaking of a forthcoming influx of 200,000 from Podolia will increase the economic crisis and supply Poland with revolutionaries.
The Polish Socialist Party (F.P.S.) is reported to be organising the working classes lo light for a P.P.S. Government either by constitutional or revolutionary means. Its chief supporters are the railway workers ; its chief struggle is against the popularity of the National Workmen&apos;s Party and the Christian Democrats, it attempts to combat the drift to Communism by reorganising the Trades Unions as Factory Unions, under a scheme giving each factory a committee with one representative to every 50 workers. Repressive measures have driven the Communists under-ground ; they have promised re-emergence when war again breaks out with Soviet Russia. Meanwhile the disintegration of the party has caused it to sock agreement with the left wing of the P.P.S.In Upper Silesia, which is considered good ground for propaganda, a combination has been formed called &quot;The Upper Silcsian Communist Party,&quot; working to create an independent Soviet Republic of Upper Silesia. Little military propaganda is at present being done, as the Communists consider that the bad conditions of the troops and the deterioration of morale consequent on the Armistice are helping them.The American Joint Distribution Committee is rumoured to be carrying on a spy service for the Bolsheviks. Many members of this Committee -Jews provided with American passports are said to spread Bolshevik agitation and propaganda on the front.The Peace Negotiations.The Bolshevik Foreign Office is informed by its agent in Poland that the Polish Ministry for Foreign Affairs has received reports from Riga that the Soviet Peace Delegation is purposely prolonging the peace negotiations in order to give time for the deepening of social conflicts caused by tho grave economic crisis through which Poland is passing. Polish information from Riga is to the effect that the Bolshevik Delegation arc speculating on a revolution in Poland, and attach small importance to the Riga Conference. They calculate also that the prolongation of the Riga negotiations will make it impossible for the Polish Government to raise the long-dated loan in America, which is the only possible mode of averting the economic crisis. England and America, the Bolshevik agents report, are distrustful of Poland owing to the uncertainty of her Eastern policy, and Polish diplomacy in London and Washington has not been able to overcome the distrust which the Polish offensive last summer created in these capitals.The American authorities oh 5th January regarded the signature of the Peace negotiations at Riga as near at hand. The French Govcrn-ment, they said, was of opinion that it is inexpedient to attach any great importance to the exact wording of the points which are concerned with the future in view of the ever-present possibility of revolution in Russia.Foreign Affairs.An arrangement has been mooted by which the expenses of arming the Polish Army, as foreseen in the draft of the Franco-Polish Military Convention, would be covered by credits granted by France to Poland for that purpose. This scheme, which has the support of Stechkovski, had been the subject of discussion between the Polish Supreme Command and the French Military Mission in Poland. The Polish Foreign Office feared earty in January that it might complicate the Paris Conference by arousing British antagonism, and even lead to a forced modification of the Franco-Polish Military Convention.Conferences early in January with Mr. Stambolisky, the Bulgarian Prime Minister, are reported to have given positive results.  Poland is
eager to draw the Bulgarians into an understanding, presumably because Bulgaria is antagonistic to Jugo-Slavia, which lias concluded an alliance with Czecho-Slovakia.On 11 tli January Pilsudsky was reported to bo opposed to Bnlahovitch, who, contrary to his obligation, was carrying on negotiations with the Roumanian Military Mission in Poland and with Sfambolisky. Bala-hovitch was consequently preparing to move to Belgrade, while Savinkoff was going to Paris.Prince Sapieha and Daszynski are reported to be in conflict over relations with Germany. Daszynski, whose policy is suspected by anti-Socialists to be influenced by Berlin, wants a commercial agreement with Germany&apos;at all costs as the only way to economic salvation. Sapieha opposes Daszynski, being convinced that political concessions will follow a commercial agreement.Warsaw is reported to be in close relations with Vilna, and to control and direct the whole Government of Central Lithuania. M. Trampo-zynski, President of the Sejm, is said to be arranging the election of the Central Lithuanian Parliament, in which Zeligowski&apos;s 25,000 troops will take part.Allegations are made in Bolshevist quarters that a secret military convention, directed against the Bolsheviks, has been concluded between Poland and Finland. It is aided by a fresh supplementary military alliance between Poland and France. French action at Warsaw and Bucharest is said to have enabled Take Jonescu to arrange for joint action between Poland and Rumania. France, it is alleged, is also trying to drive Hungary into a military combination, and is credited with the intention of reinstating the Kerensky Government as French debt collector and as a barrier against a Russo-German rap p roc lie merit.In reply to notes from the Soviet Government, it is pointed out that the territory occupied by ZeligoWski&apos;s army nowhere touches the frontier of Russia ; that the army is not at war with Russia, and considers itself bound by the armistice and peace preliminaries Signed at Riga.The Soviet Delegation is reported to agree to restore the trophies taken by the Tsarist Government during the fight for the independence of Poland. In return Russia wants similar objects of Russian origin and manufacture which fall to Poland on her liberation. Russia is unwilling to return articles which, in the opinion of Soviet delegates, have au importance for general European civilisation.The Polish Council of Ministers has agreed that American financiers can have monopolies in Poland on tobacco, matches, salt, sugar, and oil in exchange for a loan in dollars. Only the party of the Left disapproves of these concessions, as it is feared that America will get too great a hold both on the internal and external policy of Poland.Endeavours have been made to obtain the support of France in Washington for obtaining this loan, and in some circles the admission of a representative of America to take part in the Polish Council is even suggested.Poles and Germans.The friction between the Polish Government and its German sub-jects in the Posen and Pommern districts was reported at the end of December to show no marked signs of diminution. Germans were still leaving the Polish towns, the social and economic life of which was suffering severely. The closing of German middle schools, on account of the teachers refusing to take the Polish service oath, was having serious results economically.  Prices have risen from 100 percent, to 500 per
cent, during the last three mouths, and economic conditions wore altogether unstable. Even the Polish rural population was inclined to favour the former German regime, and a German attempt to regain the former possession would, it was said, meet with little resistance. It also appeared that many of the troops to bedemohilised, ex-German trained soldiers, would be passive and approving witnesses of a German coup.It is reported that the Poles and the Dautzigers have arrived at some sort of agreement to secure their own interests against those of England. The exploitation of tho Baltic whatever this may mean has been left to the Poles.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.GREECE.Labour Unrest.The Government is faced with several labour difficulties. The cigarette makers, many of whom were displaced by machinery, are clamouring for the compensation promised them by the Venizelist Administration, and appear to doubt the promises of the new Govern-ment. The men are also demanding the prohibition of the export of uuworked tobacco, so that more work may be provided, as well as the speedy rebuilding of Salonika, where the centre of the trouble lies. There is also a demand for an eight-hour day for all the railways ; here again the centre of trouble is Salonika. Finally, public employees are clamouring for the rise promised them by the last Government.The new Government has decided to continue the Veuizelist legisla-tion on the compulsory expropriation of large estates. The National Bank will issue letters to the agricultural bodies in order to pay for the expropriated land where these bodies cannot themselves find tho money.Communist Movements.The Communists are reported to be much straitened financially since the arrest at Constantinople of a messenger who had been sent to Russia, whence most of the party&apos;s funds come, for money. At the elections the Communists received a little money from the Royalists.Greek Communists have just formed an Educational Section of the Party in Athens. About 80 people attend the classes, many of them poor material, and the movement does not so far promise well. Centres of the Juvenile Communist are reported to be established at present at Pirams, Athens, Volo, Salonika, Kavalla, Drama, Serres, and Kalama.A statement, which should be received very guardedly, is made to the effect that M. Venizelos may soon resume his parliamentary work in co-operation with the present; Government and the King. It is added that if Greece carries out her promises, Constantinople may be given her within a few years. This report would appear to receive confirmation by a further report that M. Stratos, with a view to coming to an agree-ment with the Venizelists regarding the election of the President of the Greek Chamber, had, with the consent of the King, offered four ministries to the Venizelisls, who referred the offer to their absent leader.Retired officers who have been recalled were reported early in December to have formed a military club. There appears to be some danger that these officers and the public officials turned out by Venizelos may discount the consequences to themselves of his probable return by getting rid of leading Venizelists.
Italian influences seem to be playing a dubious role in tins intrigue. Italian propaganda is reported to be very actively urging the Greeks to get Vcnizelists out of tho way. Its agents are said to bo preferably Greek-speaking Italian subjects, some of them known to be in close touch with Stratos. Its organ is the newspaper &quot; Ksperino.&quot; Acting, it is said, on the instructions of the Vatican and of the Italian Secret Service, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Athens paid visits of congratulations-tion to Rhallys and Gounaris, assuring them that all Catholics were on the side of the ex-King.JUGO-SLAVIA.The recent strike of miners in Slovenia, which spread to Bosnia-Herzegovina, was complicated by a threatened railway strike and was followed by a governmental &quot;militarizing&quot; of the status of the miners. A general strike declared at Zagreb on December 30th brought about the adoption throughout the country of measures similar to those taken at Belgrade. A number of arrests were made, and the meeting place of the Communists in Belgrade was closed.Many rather alarmist statements have been made, dwelling upon Communist permeation of Government offices and of the Army and Navy, and upon Communist plots. Thus in Bosnia the discovery of a school for the education of agitators is reported, and the payment of 4,800 crowns a month to agitators, mostly foreigners, for preaching sedition. In Southern Serbia the Communists are reported to have concentrated guns, munitions and machine guns. In Croatia Communism is also apparent, and Radic&apos;s followers, though they are not Communists, have Subversive aims. The agitators are said to have convinced the peasants and their womenfolk of the imminence of revolution.It may, however, be doubted whether an actual Bolshevik plot was contemplated ; more probably a general strike was intended after the militarization of the miners and the railwaymen.The result of it all seems to be a growing secession of the sober elements from Communism. Many members of the Intelligentsia and of the working classes have formed a separate group, which has for organ the new journal &quot; The Socialist,&quot; and which has broken with the Third International and returned to the fold of International socialism. An ultimate alliance of this party with the Socialist Democrats seems probably.The position of Radio is reported to remain obscure. It now seems possible that Radic may decide to sit with his party in the Assembly, which will make mere vapour of the proclamation of a Croatian Peasant Republic. But as long as the Government can maintain order the &quot;Republic&quot; will not take being, whatever Radic may do.BULGARIA.Late in December political affairs were reported to be moving languidly in the absence of Stambolisky, who was expected on his return to cultivate better relations with Serbia, as well us to compose differences in his own Cabinet by changes of personnel if necessary. The Serbian interruption of raihvay communication with Bulgaria was resented and the belief. that it might be due to internal disturbances in Jugo-Slavia was considered insufficient.The use of a compulsory labour organisation is reported to have saved the country about 200,000,000 leva.   The intention- of training a new
army is disclaimed, though it has been hinted that some day the Powers may (hid it to thoir interest to replace Bulgarian picks by rifles.Tho Communists are working hard for tho resumption of relations with Russia and urging the Sobranjo to insist on compliance with Moscow&apos;s request that diplomatic and commercial relations shall be resumed and that tho Bulgarian army shall not be used against the Soviet.A. group in Paris is reported to be directing the secret formation in Sofia of an organisation, chiefly Jewish, which aims at capturing political and commercial supremacy in the Balkan States.Tho Ministerial Council has decided to authorise the immigration of Russian subjects of Bulgarian origin, who have left Russia at various times or with YYrangePs army.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES.TURKEY. Communist Influences at Angora.In Anatolia the Nationalists are reported to be disguising their real repugnance to Communism beneath some show of applying revolutionary principles. Early in December their plans for military co-operation with the Bolsheviks were developing, and the arrival in Anatolia of Soviet officials and missions was reported to be frequent.The Communist Party in the Great National Assembly at Angora was then officially constituted and recognised. Led by Ahmed Ferid Bey, the Nationalist- Commissioner for Finance, it forthwith started a campaign for the repudiation of Turkish debts, an idea not till then treated by any section of the Turkish press. More recently, according to Moscow, the Angora Assembly has adopted a new electoral franchise, providing for the election of a deputy from every trade and profession. Moscow is clearly trying to make the best of an uncertain business, and the real or simulated fidelity of its agents at Angora will bo active in building and supporting its influence until the undermining of it, which the proposed conference in London should carry far, is complete.A newspaper article from Baku, dated 19th December, and published in a Russian journal denounced alleged English attempts to bring about a quarrel between the Nationalists and Russia. This English cunning, it says, is &quot; making some people believe that the Turkish people could go ;i hand in glove with the Imperialists, who are endeavouring to destroy &quot; its very existence.&quot;Towards the middle of December a strange story was circulating in Constantinople of a plot among the Cossacks of wrangel&apos;s late army to capture by a sudden armed rising the administrative power of the town. The inception of the movement would seem to be due to a Bolshevik agent, one Madame Fillipova-Morozova, an adventuress lately arrived in Constantinople from Odessa. Some well-known military men would appear to have been principals in this intrigue, which seemed to rely for its success upon the seizure of important Allied officials who were to be killed if the suppression of the movement were attempted. What was to follow the capture of Constantinople was completely and characteristically uncertain. Information seems to point to indefinite, plans and to a lack of co-ordination of Bolshevik activities in Constantinople. Action was to be delayed until liaison was established with the local Bolsheviks, whose co-operation, above all financially, was deemed essential. The plot, if successful, would have discredited the Government and the
Allies; if it failed it would have turned the minds of certain anti-Bolshevik Russian elements towards anarchism. In either case Bol-shovism would be served.The Porte and the Nationalists.Early in January the attitude of the Government towards the Nationalists would appear to have been sympathetic but cautious. It held no official communication with Angora, but there was personal coin-muuication between the members of both governments. The Mission of Reconciliation under Izzet Pasha was then reported to have left Angora and the absence of results was attributed to Nationalist defiance over Smyrna and Thrace. The Bolsheviks, it was said, were probably using the failure of the mission to strengthen their hold on Anatolia ; and Communist members of the Great National Assembly were thought to be pressing Mustapha Kemal from within. There were other reports of Kemalist intransigence. According to these the Kemalists openly declared that they form the only true Government of Turkey, with Constantinople as a dependent province. They accused Constantinople of usurping their rights and claimed a new treaty dictated by themselves, and the repudiation of all Turkish debts of tho Imperialist epoch. Mustapha Kemal was styled the Supreme head of Turkey. Recent Nationalist utterances are in themselves equivocal as regards the trend of policy which the Nationalists may now see fit to pursue. After strongly repudiating any idea of co-operation with the Government at the London conference they have more recently been throwing out hints that sweet reasonableness is a marketable commodity.Talaat Pasha.It was reported late in December that an agreement was being attempted between Talaat and Mustapha Kemal. The Kemalists might agree to an understanding with Talaat, but not to one with Enver, whom they regarded as the tool of Moscow. Talaat&apos;s urgency that the Porte and the Angora government shall remain intransigent towards the Allies is believed to be dictated by anxiety to exact the utmost possible from negotiations with the latter than from any decided preference for Moscow, and he may well end by falling in with the plans of the Italian Government, which is working for peace and accommodation on the basis of a revised treaty.The Treaty o! Sevres.Public opinion in Constantinople would also appear to tend to the belief that Turkey may be reconciled with England and Franco and once more become a buffer against Russia.Ghalih Kemali Bey, who, in the earlier part of December, returned from Constantinople to Rome, is said to have reported to the Cabinet that the Treaty of.Sevres dissatisfied both France and Italy, which could not, however, take independent action. Italian public opinion considered that the re-establishment of peace in the East was conditional upon the modification of the Treaty. It was advised that direct contact with the new Greek Government should be established. The role indicated to the Central Government seemed to be that of mediator between the Nationalists and the Entente Powers. Later in the month Ghalib Kemali Bey returned to Rome to ascertain what immediate economic and financial assistance Italy was prepared to give Turkey, and upon what conditions. The Turkish Government, it was intimated through Ghalib, would do its best to follow Italian advice to eliminate the present duality in Turkey,
but this object could only be achieved through a modification of the Treaty of Sevres&apos;.   Turkey accepted Italy&apos;s position in Anatolia.Considerable feeling against the French has been aroused amongst the Armenians in Constantinople by the accounts given by the Armenians evacuated from Cilicia by the French.Pan-Islamism.At a Fan-Islamic conference held at Sivas early in January under the presidency of El Seyid Ahmed, the former sheikh of the Senussi, an attempt was made to co-ordinate the activities of Moslem States and commodities for the purpose of creating an Islamic union. The Coustanti-riople Government intends to ask the Sultan&apos;s approval of a project converting the Ministry of Evkaf (pious foundations) into a department of the Sheikh-uMslamat, on the pattern of the ancient Christian com-munities within the Ottoman Empire.Russian Reactionary Ambitions.The Russian Reactionaries are said to be more than ever inclined towards Germany since tho defeat of Wrangel, and to have asked him to shift his headquarters and his activities to Berlin. They appear to hope for the possible transfer of wrangel&apos;s troops to Asia Minor and for the possibilities which such a move would imply, viz., his reappearance on the Russian coast of the Black Sea, junction with the Kemalists and a new campaign from the Caucasus. The Kemalists, it is hinted, are anti-Bolshevik at heart, and would readily join YYrangel in order to expel the English and the French from Asia Minor and oven from Turkey.The Sheikh el Senussi.The Angora Government is reported to have been recently bestowing considerable flattery upon the Sheikh el Senussi. It is not known whether the Nationalists have given up their scheme of changing the Khalif, for the reversion of whose post the Sheikh was one of the candidates. Meanwhile, the Sheikh&apos;s waverings between the Kemalists, the Sultan, and the Entente had served him badly, and his suite has dispersed.PERSIA.The situation is undoubtedly precarious. The rumoured abdication of the Shah was officially denied, but the causes of the Cabinet crisis at Teheran are not yet sufficiently explored to remove the suspicion tbat worse remains behind. The British evacuation of North Persia will make the Government look for protection rather to the Soviet than to the Indian Government. The Bolsheviks are said to have left Resht and to be leaving Enzeli.Despite the clauses in the Treaty, of which some account was given in our December number, which provide that neither State shall interfere in the internal affairs of the other, Tchitcherin has requested &apos;the Persian Government to give freedom of action to the Communist Party. This request has been refused, but an amnesty is to be granted to all political offenders on the understanding that if members of the Persian Communist Party commit acts in the future rendering them liable to punishment the Soviet Government will not again require their pardon. There is also something sinister in LitvinofFs announcement that as soon as Britain withdraws her troops from Persia Russia will use her influence over friendly revolutionary forces for a peaceful solution of the conflicts.
A peaceful solution iu Litviuoffs mouth is apt to bo an equivalent of conversion to the Soviet regime.The Iran Communist Party is reported to have sent out an appeal to the workers of Persia, exhorting them to drive out tho British and to free Persia from the capitalist yoke. The workers are also to overthrow the Shah and to emancipate the peasants from tho landowners. A national army to protect Persia from foreign capitalist attacks is also asked for,EGYPT,The general situation is distinguished by a strange amalgam of sus-pense and indifference possiblo only in the East. The young men are hopeful of getting tho Independence they have been crying for, especially when they notice their British colloaguos taking it for granted that their work will soon be over. Heal uneasiness, however, underlies the surface calm.Much of the present quiet is due to the Courts-martial. The trial of the ringleaders in the recent outrages, not as political offenders but as ordinary felons, has steadied things remarkably. Many of these men belong to the Effendi class and are really the master criminals. The police feel they can keep order so long as they are supported by the Home Authorities, but they consider that lenient action by the Colonial Office, such as the pardou of the men convicted, would probably result in a recrudescence of trouble.Opinion generally demands the end of the Capitulations. Persons affected by them, who would resent Egyptian rule and the loss of their privileges, will gladly agree to the English protectorate if the English will let them remain.A number of Egyptians, especially the Fellahin, soe something sinister in the collapse of cotton values which has hit the rich natives hard and has load to a break iu prices other than house rents and tourist fees. Many reason that it is ominous that this calamity should synchro-uise with the promise of independence, and are inclined to look upon it as created by the English, to give Egypt an example of their power, and as an earnest of the financial disasters England can inflict on Egypt if the Egyptians insist on the British departure. The rural Egyptian is also dominated by the fear that the English may rob him of his water.Though A.dli Pasha disclaims it, a new Party is developing which is regarded as looking to him for leadership. It is known as the &quot; Party of Moderation &quot; and is attacked by the Zagloulists as &quot; the people in a hurry,&quot; who appear to favour official negotiations forthwith without insisting on waitiug, as Zagloul desires, until the question of the Protec-torate has been settled. Adli and Zagloul are popularly supposed to represent these different lines of policy.Zagloul Pasha has great influence, and even those who think his policy mistaken are afraid to express their views openly. It is reported that at a meeting of Egyptians in Constantinople, Dr. Amin is said to have proposed that all support should henceforth be given to Zagloul, their only hope. One speaker, contending that the Egyptians had no real enthusiasm or mind of their own, declared that even were the British without cause to hang five Egyptian notables, no opposition would be made by the indifferent cattle-like natives. Nevertheless, there are dissensions among the Zagloulists, whose local Central Committee is also believed to be divided. The party would also appear to be iu some trouble financially. Its present policy is an attempt to discredit British interests by a process of &quot;pin-pricking.&quot;   The resignation of Lordo AS867X
Milner has somewhat dismayed Zagloulist circles. Zagloul himself seems to have withdrawn from his attitude of claiming the abolition of the Protectorate as a preliminary essential to final negotiations.Later advices involve tho political situation in growing obscurity. Serious developments appear to be pending. In the third decade of the month five members of Zagloul&apos;s Egyptian Nationalist Delegation, including three of the &quot; Four&quot; who brought to Egypt the draft of the Milnor proposals last September, left Paris for Egypt in order to further the mission of the Delegation, leaving three members with Zagloul Pasha in Paris. Zagloul was later reported to have telegraphed to tho Cairo Committee of the Delegation, instructing them to boycott the returning members, whose homecoming, according to another report, may have been partly duo to exhaustion of the Delegation^ funds.There is little doubt that Adli Pasha&apos;s policy of conciliatory nogotia-tions is gaining adherents.Thoughtful people are realising that self-government involves paying for a standing Army and Navy and for consuls. The realisation of the consequent expense has sobered many who were clamorous a year ago. There is, too, a general feeling that complete surrender to the extremists will quickly bring a reaction and a cry for the return of the British Protectorate.An intelligent and observant University student has said that there are no real grounds for the assumption that the whole country supports Zagloul. He insisted that the intelligent classes were increasingly of opinion that a real danger threatened the chances of independence through ZaglouPs obstinacy in insisting on the abolition of the Protectorate before the resumption of negotiations. The student was persuaded that Adli&apos;s influence is growing. &quot; If,&quot; he said, &quot; Adli and his party will &quot; take into their confidence the young men wdio practically conducted the &quot; movement for independence, they would easily control the situation and &quot; bring the people to reason. Unfortunately, Adli and his friends keep &quot; aloof from the active politicians, thus awaiting the course of events &quot; rather, than seeking to guide them into a reasonable channel. All of us &quot; respect Zagloul, but we can&apos;t help seeing that he&apos;s leading the country &quot; into a lane which has no exit, and the worst of it is that he is out of &quot;&apos; touch with things here as they really are. The Committee, far from &quot; enlightening him, constantly assure him that his influence is paramount &quot; and unshaken and the views of the Egyptians unchanged.&quot;The weight of political pressure on British administrative machinery is lessened by the indifference of the Fellahin to everything but their immediate necessities and by the smallness of the groups actively interested in politics. This is an invitation to &quot; hurry slowly &quot; with our reforms. It is probable that agitation will only be revived by the spur of disappointed hopes. Egyptians would appear to think that the forecast published in the &quot; Times&quot; represents terms proposed by the British Government. They ignore the possibility that these may be merely recommendations of the Commissioners. Trouble might be caused if it were pleaded that the Milner report is only for the guidance of the Government and does not reflect the Governments intentions.Miscellaneous.The anniversary of the Proclamation of the British Protectorate over Egypt passed over with the usual demonstrations, but with no serious disturbances.Mr. de Mecq, deputed by the old Russian Government to treat with the incipient Bolsheviks, has been in Egypt for some time, explaining present discontents, which he traces to the universal Jewish ambitions,
It is reported that Yusuf Sadiq Pasha has been deported from Constantinople. For finance Yusuf was the introducer of Bolo Pasha to the Khedive Ismail, and for finance quarrelled with the last Khedive, He was once &quot; kckhic&quot; or political agent at Constantinople,PALESTINE.The different peoples of the country are reported to be watching carefully how far the present Jewish administration is going to extend. There is a fear that the Jews may seek to dominate in Jerusalem. The Moslems are jealous; the Nomad Arabs are terrified lest tho influx of Zionists should bring about tho loss of their land.and liberty ; tho religious houses fear what Jewish predominancy may mean to them. The communities have lost tho money which accrued from pilgrimages, and arc seeking to recoup themselves by raising tho price of land, of which they own the best about Jerusalem and other towns. There will not, however, bo trouble until tho High Commissioner issues his final manifesto.The American Zionists would seem to intend building up a Zion of their own, and will not pool their money, which is disquieting, financially and politically. It appears that these Jews will arrive as American citizens, demanding their political rights as Americans and asserting American ideas of government,7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES.THE CAUCASUS.Reports of an early Bolshevik attack upon Georgia receive some confirmation from statements attributed to Kopp, the Bolshevik represen-tative in Berlin. Kopp affirms that Russia must be prepared for a new war, whose first outbreak will probably be in the Caucasus. Kopp states that the Entente will despatch wrangel&apos;s re-organised forces to Georgia and that Russia has positive evidence of Entente designs on that country. He adds that the Soviet Government is therefore ouly demobilizing two-thirds of the Staff and of the Reserve and is training the best elements of the Army so that they may develop into picked troops.Soviet emissaries in Baku were reported early in December to have warned the Soviet Government that Mustapha Kemal is playing a double game and is in communication with English agents. Radek has been sent to Angora to look into matters and by a reconciliation of the Armenians with the Soviet to save what is left of Armenia,GEORGIA,The firmness of the Georgian Government, in the face of the con-continually renewed plottings and threatenings of Moscow, merits the recent offer of de jure recognition which the Conference at Paris has addressed to it. For the moment, at any rate, Bolshevik aggression against Georgia seems to be frustrated. The discovery in the nick of time of the Red invasion from Azerbaijan, which was to coincide with a local Bolshevik rising, caused a strong anti-Bolshevik revulsion among the Georgian workers. The Turkish Nationalists held their hand. The Red army, finding that Georgia objected to &quot;liberation,&quot; become de-moralised, and were asking to be sent back, when news that Baku hadb %
been given over to the garrison for pillaging, finally undermined discipline, and the majority of the Red soldiers, thoroughly out of hand, seized trains and hastened to more promising ground. Tbo Soviet Government withdrew tho rest from tho Georgian frontier, leaving only unimportant frontier guards.The real motive for the attack and of Bolshevik intrigues in Georgia is doubtless the fact that only through that country can the oil, kerosene, and naphtha from Baku be conveyed to the Standard Oil Company, with whom tho Bolshevik Government has for months been negotiating regarding them.Schiemanu, the Bolshevik emissary, has been recalled from Tiflis for bungling tho scheme to cause a Red revolt, which would have brought the waiting Bolshevik army over the frontier. Trotsky is reported to be furious at Schiemann&apos;s failure and the lost opportunity of Bolshevising Georgia. Schiemann&apos;s incapacity will find no defenders ; the traders will be as indignant as Trotsky at the frustrating of their plans.Despite this momentary relief the situation continues grave. The Georgian Government has decided to attach all property of the Soviet Government and of the Azerbaijan Republic situated in Georgia. On January 17th tho Georgian Authorities in Tiflis sealed up the stores of the Russian &quot; Centrosoyus &quot; (Co-operative) and the cash, and attached all the goods of the Soviet Republic. The Government had also closed the premises of the Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party and stopped the issue of the Communist newspaper.The stoppage of supplies of oil for Georgia by Russia and Azerbaijan with the consequent paralysis of the services of transport and communica-tion in the country, makes the vulnerability of Georgia sadly plain. It is to be feared that the edifice which the Georgians are working to maintain against encroachments from the North and East is a frail one. This time the plot has failed, largely because of the abstention of the Turks ; another time occurrences may be less fortunate.Karl Kautsky, the German Socialist, now living a life of unsocialistic luxury in Georgia, is reported to serve as liaison between Georgia and Berlin, and it is regarded as almost certain that he will be Germany&apos;s future representative in the country.ARMENIA.The Armenian Soviet Government is reported to have addressed an ultimatum to Turkey concerning tho evacuation of occupied territories, as a result of which the Turks have retired from Alexandropol. Fortified by Moscow, Armenia requires the immediate evacuation of Kars and the withdrawal of all Turkish troops to the frontiers of 1914, and is asking reparation for Turkish atrocities and pillage.TURKESTAN.Proposals are on foot for the transfer of Indian Revolutionaries in Bolshevik hands from Tashkent to Kabul. Mahendra Nath Roy is behind this transfer. He, Abdurrab and Acharya are reported to have left Tashkent about January 20th for Moscow to attend a Conference of Indians. It was considered uncertain whether Roy would himself return to Tashkent, his presence among the propagandists not conducing to peaceful and united effort. He is not in good odour with the Indians, who are also reported as disaffected towards their present employers. Koy lias given a considerable sum in gold to Mohamed Ali, whom the Soviet Authorities distrust.
AFGHANISTAN.Information lends to show that Kabul is suggosted as the head-quarters of Indian propaganda. The Bolsheviks favour tlje maintenance of tho Central Revolutionary Committee at Tashkent, but require a base nearer India.It is believed that Suritz, the Bolshevik representative at Kabul, will shortly be replaced by one Legrahd, tho head Bolshevik representative in Armenia. This change of personnel is almost certainly occasioned by the unwillingness of Suritz to work along with or under Maheudra Natli Roy, whom the Bolsheviks have been proposing to put in charge of their advanced centre of Indian propaganda at Kabul. Suritz&apos;s position at &quot;Kabul was, late in January, ono of considerable difficulty. The arrival of the British Mission preceded the ratification of the Afghan-Bolshevik treaty and Suritz considered that the voluntary, or involuntary, procrasti-nation of Moscow was gravely compromising Soviet chances.An extraordinary Bokharan Mission has left for Afghanistan, and an extraordinary Afghan Mission is on its way to the capital of Bokhara.The representative of the Anatolian Government, Abdurrahman Bey, is reported to have left Moscow for Kabul.8. FAR EASTERN STATES. SIBERIA.According to Moscow, a conference of Socialists of the Far East, attended by delegates from China, Japan, Korea, and Formosa, has been held in Chita. This conference marks the beginning of united revolu-tionary work by the Far Eastern proletariat.The Japanese hope that the Vladivostock Assembly would not acquiesce formally in the new Communist regime established at Chita has been disappointed. Vladivostock recognises Chita, and its Assembly will act as a local governing body until a Russian Far Eastern Parliament is convened. The Japanese forces in Siberia have been warned to prepare for emergencies, and Vladivostock has been advised that, if actual amalgamation takes place with Chita, Japan will protect her independent interests in Siberia. There have already been disturbances, and the Japanese are disarming the local militia. Chita is not conciliatory, and has assured Japan that the new regime will respect all agreements enacted between the Japanese and the authorities at Verkhne-Udinsk until the agreements are revised or abrogated. Moscow alleges Japanese intrigues with the Ussuriau Cossacks as a weapon against the Far Eastern Government.The Burials and the Mongolians are to be separated from the Far Eastern Republic and a special independent province formed of them.It is reported that there are no political organisations among the German and Austrian prisoners remaining in Siberia. Those who became Bolsheviks from motives of self-preservation are now reported to be changing their views as a result of better treatment.CHINA.In well-informed quarters it is not considered probable that Bolshevism will prosper in South China. Its chance of success is greater in the North, where the people are poorer and the idea of State land control is more familiar, since there is historic precedent for a system of land tenure
whereby all land is held under the payment of a tenth of the crop in kind, as rent to the Government.Yourin, the Bolshevik representative, is reported recontly to have presented a lengthy note to the Chinese Foreign Office, hinting that the Far Eastern &quot;Republic offers a great field for development to private capital and initiative, and will welcome offers in this sense from the Chinese. Yourin spoke of a revision of treaties, of the necessity of Consular representation (though he is prepared to abolish Consular juris-diction) and required the recognition of Russians interest in the Chinese Eastern Railway.Rumours that Sun Yat Sen is again bidding for power and intends to inaugurate a Chinese Soviet are alternately advanced and denied. Somo colour is given to them by bis endeavours to get members of Parliament to declare him the rightful President of China. At present leader of the Cantonese Kuo Ming-tang Party, the extremist body concerned in sotting up a military Government at Canton last year, he views Japanese Imperialism with unwavering hostility.JAPAN.The Japanese Government is reported to be detormiued to stamp out Socialism by drastic action. The breaking up of a Socialist meeting by the police recently led to a fight and many arrests.In imitation of the Bolsheviks, Japanese extremists are using the paper currency of the country for propaganda purposes. Socialist phrases surcharged upon bank notes are easily circulated and escape the notice of the authorities because those into whoso hands they come are afraid to communicate with the police.The growing Labour Party is reported to be losing faith in the Diet, neither party of which is enthusiastic about universal suffrage, a bold advocacy of which might have brought labour to the side of the Kensei-Kai in their contest with the Seiyu-Kai or Constitutional Party, which supports the agriculturists.9. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.Unemployment.Although it has provoked an outcry in some places, the cut in wages is, on the whole, being accepted with a good grace. In certain industries the drop has been considerable. Wages in the textile trade have gone down as much as 22^ per cent. While the public appreciates the consequent reduction in prices, manufacturers, who during the period of contraction managed to eliminate much of the driftwood of labour, report an improved output despite their reduced working forces.The situation is undoubtedly such as to give considerable scope for the activities of agitators, and a disposition on the part of the revo-lutionaries to incite the unemployed to violence seems to be increasing. The Officer Commanding British Columbia describes the situation in &quot;Vancouver as a powder mine which may go up at any moment, and the action of British unemployed in seizing public buildings has attracted attention which may become imitation. Among the unemployed in Winnipeg, also, a dangerous temper is reported. At a meeting at which the majority of the men were youngsters of the shiftless and dissatisfied day Jabouriug class (the last to be employed and the first to be paid off),
the audience refused in a definitely hostile manner to sing the National Anthem.On the whole, however, the majority of the unemployed want work and will do nothing to upset their chances so long as there is reasonable hope of obtaining it. They arc even anxious that extremist members should be removed from the Committee on unemployment.Farmers maintain that one of the chief reasons for the present unoni-ployment is the way in which agricultural workers have been persuaded to enter the factories ; now that trade has become slack these workers have been dismissed and thrown on the community for support. The Immigration Department lias re-enacted the special regulations which were enforced last year, and for the first three months of the year 1921, no mechanic, artisan, or labourer will be allowed to land in Canada from Britain unless he is in possession of 250 dollars, which, it is calculated, should keep him until the snow melts and agricultural employment begins.In Toronto there has recently been somo criticism of advertisements issued by the Ontario Government in England to encourage the emigra-tion to Canada of people for whom, it is said, employment is not available under existing conditions, and several newspapers arc insisting that only competent agriculturists willing to settle on the land and possessed of sufficient capital to equip and stock their holdings can be granted financial assistance by the British or Canadian Governments without doing injustice to the taxpayers and wage workers of the Dominion.Returned Soldiers and the Foreign Element.Meanwhile, bitterness against foreigners is reported to be growing and men who find on their return from the war that their former jobs are held by aliens are grumbling against immigration. This anti-foreign temper, though it increases the possibility of disorder, may interfere with the plans of the agitators who, while keenly anxious that Britons should co-operate in revolutionary action, openly prefer to deal with foreign rather than with English-speaking workmen.Something like a Jewish question appears to bo growiug up in Winnipeg, where hate of Great Britain and British views is being inculcated by the Reds among young Jews of the lower class. English-speaking Russian Jews arc reported to be especially active. The &quot; Young Men&apos;s Hebrew Association &quot; is far more radical than the clubs frequented by the older Jews, and it is thought that with the second generation a danger to be seriously reckoned with may arise.Communists.. In Montreal four Communist organisations are reported Jewish, Russian, Ukrauian and English which will be combined under an executive on the basis of the 3rd International.Hamilton extremists, while healthily averse from risking their skins, are reported to be planning an elaborate secret underground system divided into groups of ten. They are trying to establish a small press of their own for printing seditious matter and they circulate extracts from the Glasgow &quot; Socialist.&quot; . . .......A new monthly periodical issued by the Anarchist-Communists is being circulated by the Labour College at Toronto. It is named the &quot; Svobodnoyo Obshtshostvo &quot; (Free Society). Copies of a Socialist pamphlet emanating from Glasgow, entitled &quot; Direct Action,&quot; are also being circulated. Pamphlets are in future to be smuggled into Windsor from Detroit and sent by express to Hamiliton. &apos;;     &apos;  . .-
The Loggers.The secretary of tho Loggers&apos; Union in British Columbia reports that the outlook is worse than last year. The men are indifferent; criticism has replaced enthusiasm ; and tho Union is blamed for the recent fall in wages. Agitators, meanwhile, have since the beginning of December beon advocating force and direct action.Ono of tho prime movers and directors in the general strike of June 1019, Jack Kavauagh, recently returned from England. His visit to the old country has converted him from his advocacy of direct action. Ho now believes that only political action and the representation of labour in the legislative bodies of the country can benefit the workers. The expediency of admitting him into the United Kingdom has therefore been demonstrated.Shipbuilders.In the beginning of the month tho Reds were reported to be making capital out of the deadlock in the Dominion shipyards. Tho men claim that the former scale of pay applies to boats still unfinished. Certain declarations to the contrary by tho President of the Colling wood Ship Company appear to have been unnecessarily irritating and were hotly resented by the Shipbuilders&apos; organisation, which was both loyal and moderate throughout the war. A suggestion that the men should go back to work on the old scale of pay, but should then be gradually weeded out until a higher efficiency was secured, has been advanced and would, it is claimed, satisfy all concerned.Miners.The miners are reported to be working at full strength and producing an unusual quantity of coal. English-speaking miners are described as intensely British and loyal, but as even more intensely anti-American ; any and every American organisation arouses their distrust. Ultra-radical speeches are rarely heard amongst them and the antipathy towards the Government and the police in South Alberta is reported to have entirely died down.The Orientals.A number of Japanese employed at Ocean Falls have been dismissed for disciplinary reasons. The greater number of the remainder will probably be replaced by white men, who are now available.A pamphlet is being circulated in Chinese under a title which signifies &quot; The Crime of the Capitalist System.&quot;It is reported that tho Chinese students, who have attended the Esperanto class at Vancouver, have become red hot revolutionaries. On the other hand, some of the frequenters of the Socialist Party Hall think the extirpation of the Chinese and the burning of Chinatown would improve the labour situation.SOUTH AFRICA. Nationalism and Sinn Fein.The hoped for landslide to the Nationalists has not taken place. The fusion of the South African party is remarkably thorough. Few Dutch farmers of weight have deserted to the Nationalists and the return of General Smuts by a small majority over all other bodies is regarded by cautious judges as the probable result of the elections of February 8th.
Natives and coloured people are strongly advised in tho official organ of the African political organisation to vote against the Nationalists in the coming Election,Although the Nationalist leaders deprecate the idea of force, they have sown the seeds of hitter anti-British feeling and some of their followers are ripe for mischief should the occasion arise. Anti-British propaganda is spread abroad by a new publication entitled &quot;The Republic,&quot; which is tho official organ of the Irish Republican Association of South Africa. This organisation, which has established branches at Bloeuifoutoin, Cradock and Durban, and is on the point of starling similar branches in all the large towns, made full use of the death of the late Lord Mayor of Cork in its anti-British campaign.The result of General Smuts&apos; tour throughout the country districts has been vory encouraging. A new spirit of co-operation and forbearance has shown itself everywhere, despite the frantic efforts of the Nationalists in certain parts to wreck his meetings. Their tactics have only disgusted the better section of their own supporters, who are drifting back to the South African party. The danger of secession and its economic conse-quences has profoundly impressed them, and they recognise the possibility of destroying South African credit and so bringing all development to a standstill.The &quot; Hollandsch Zuid-Afrika,&quot; issued by the Dutch South African Union, is actively engaged in promoting emigration from the Continent, particularly Hollanders, iu conjunction with the newly established &quot; South African Emigration Bureau&quot; lately formed at Pretoria under the patronage of General Muller and other partisans of General Hortzog.Labour.Obvious signs of unrest among the natives are attributed partly to the importation of native labour from other parts of the Union, but chiefly to the inadequate rate of pay given to natives. It is believed that were the Government to arrange a minimum wage for native labourers this agitation, which is at present spreading, would probably entirely subside.In many parts of the Union labour conditions appear to be very grave. The leather trade has been seriously affected by the glut of imports from Britain, Belgium, Germany and Japan. Many of the mines have closed down and the influx of poor whites from the country districts has coin-plicated matters still further. In the diamond fields whole families are reported to be starving and living iu overcrowded shanties made of paraffin tins.Owing to the firm stand taken by the Durban Municipal Council, who threatened to close down the whole system if necessary, the Tramway strike fizzled out and the men returned to work.The following is the programme of the annual delegates&apos; meeting of the International Socialist League held on January 2nd : 1. The attitude of the Party towards the subject races of the country in their various aspects : (a) Uncivilised tribesmen.(b) Agricultural squatters or the like.(c) Wage workers, skilled or unskilled.(d) Organised units in the labour movement, and the thesis onsubject races recently adopted by the Communist Intor-national at Moscow.2. The Dutch Nationalist movement in South Africa.
3. Tho functions of the Party, with special reference to the Moscow thesis.-1. Socialist unity in South Africa.AUSTRALIA.The attack upon the Cabinet by the Labour Party in Now South Wales has apparently failed, at any rate for a time. The Executive of the Party summoned Mr. Storey, Premier of New South Wales to appear before thoin and objecting to the long adjournment of Parliament, cover-ing tho period of Mr. Storey&apos;a visit to England, demanded that it should reassemble by March. They also insisted upon Labour appointments to the Legislative Council to secure the passage of the Labour legislation. Mr. Storey declined to obey their holiest, while the Governor is said to have refused his consent to the appointment of so large a number of now members to the Legislative Council.The New South Wales miners aro supporting the Victoria brown coal miners in the lattor&apos;s demand for equal pay with themselves, and in order to do so have placed an embargo on coal entering Victoria. The refusal of the Victorian Premier to consider the demands of the brown coal miners was based upon the great disparity between the two kinds of work and the risks run in each. The coal mines of New South Wales are deep, while the brown coal of Victoria is hewn out of the face of an open quarry by miners who are practicaily unskilled labourers. The wooden fleet owned by the Federal Government was to be used to trans-port coal to Victoria. The railways were paralysed and the railwaymen also refused to submit their demands for higher wages to arbitration, The stand taken by the authorities in a fight described by the Premier as one between constitutional and Soviet government is reported to have the approval of the country, and the Returned. Soldiers&apos; League has decided to give the government its support in every way. The shipping strike, characterised as one of the most wanton which has ever occurred in the shipping trade, has ended in the defeat of the men. The request by the representatives of the shipping strikers for a round table confer-ence was refused by the Prime Minister, owing to the marine stewards having left work and defied the award of the Arbitration Court. The strike ended towards the end of the mouth in the defeat of the men and the first victory since the war began for the employers in their contest against Labour, This upshot of the contest seems to mark the limit to which Labour can go in using industrial pressure to exact conditions favourable to itself.The effects of the strike, while it lasted, were far more serious than the Unions expected, and the leaders themselves were frightened by the political and industrial situation they had created.A further victory over extremists Avas gained in the railway strike in Western Australia, which lasted for 14 days. In this case the Goveru-ment came to terms with the strikers and recognised the principle of the eight-hour day, while the settlement of the terms of payment for night work was left to an Arbitration Court.In consequence of recent riots 100 Japanese have been sent to Thursday Island to await deportation.WEST INDIES.Trinidad.There is no evidence of unrest in the Colony. Work is plentiful and wages aro high.   None the less propaganda is being carried on by
the &quot; Universal Negro Improvement Association,&quot; and, although evidence of action by local agents of the Association is difficult to obtain, it is apparent that copies of the &quot;Negro World&quot; aro still being smuggled in, as verbatim quotations arc used by negro speakers.10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The Industrial Workers o! the World and the Third International.Early in the mouth the Industrial Workers of the World wcro invited to join the Third International and to participate in a Congress of it to he held in Moscow in January. A secret referendum was held on the question from Chicago, voting being carried on underground and not through tho post. A negro agitator secured by the I.W.W. for propaganda work among the negroes in Chicago is proving a great success and draws large crowds to his meetings.The American Federation of Labour.Mr. Gompcrs has summoned an emergency conference of the Executives of 109 national and international unions affiliated in the American Federation of Labour to meet on February 23rd. At this conference a new programme, including public ownership and democratic operation of the basic industries will bo proposed. Mr. Gompers appears to fear the result of the recent elections. He regards with anxiety the close connection of President Harding with big business interests and dreads the destruction of collective bargaining and its consequences for the trades unions. A campaign against the American Federation of Labour which is being organised by tho I.W.W. also gives Mr. Gompers something to be anxious about.The Federation^ recent formal announcement of its complete sepa-ration from Bolshevism is not only a disavowal of the Third International and the Soviet regime, but also to some extent a repudiation of the British Labour Party, the Italian Labour Party, and the International Federations of Trades Unions. In a significant phrase Mr. Gonipers indicts &quot; the new lawlessness of British Labour Unions, the oldest, most &quot; powerful and once most democratic of all trade organisations.&quot;The Socialists.At a meeting early in December of the National Executive Com-mittce of tbe Socialist Party of the United States, the latter&apos;s refusal to approve of the 21 points of the Third International was reiterated; anti-Semitism was denounced, and a demand made for the official recog-nition of the Irish Republic.The appeal for the release or commutation of the sentence of Eugene Debs has been refused by President Wilson.The Communists.A report that the Reds had planned a reign of terror by the use of bombs, &amp;c, had caused guards to be placed over public buildings, churches and certain private residences in New York. It was believed that hired professional criminals rather than anarchists had been used.Ludwig Martens.Ludwig Martens and his staff duly embarked on their return to Russia on January 22nd, proceeding direct to Gothenburg. Before Martens&apos; departure a clever scheme was devised for the retention in tho United States, for propaganda purposes, of all money collected for the Soviet Medical Relief Committee.   The Relief Commitee accepts any
sum of money not exceeding $400 and guarantees to transmit it to persons in Russia. A radio is then sent to Moscow, stating tho amount and the name of the person to whom the money is to be paid ; Moscow pays the recipient in Soviet roubles at the rate of 200 roubles to the dollar, so that the original money never leaves the United States.The instructions from Tchitcherin to Ludwig Martens to cancel contracts placed by him with American firms did not, according to Martens, apply to tho Vanderlip concessions, which were negotiated directly between the Soviet government and Vanderlip in Moscow. Early in January the Soviet, government, announced the ratification of the Kamchatka agreement with the Vanderlip syndicate and stated that they were prepared to allow Vauderlip to return to Russia. The Vamier-lip concessions, however, were granted on condition that Amorica signed a trade agreement with the Soviet government, which America has refused to do. It is unlikely therefore that the full facilities for normal business and official representation in Russia demanded by tho Soviet government as a condition of Vauderlip&apos;s return will bo conceded.In a speech, reported from Moscow as propaganda, Lenin is reported to have said &quot; Au American multi-millionaire spoke very frankly about the motives of the Treaty, viz., that America desires to have a base iu Asia in case of war with Japan. This millionaire said that if we sell Kamchatka to America he promises us such enthusiasm on the part of the population of the United States that tho American government will immediately recognise the Soviet government.&quot;Counter-revolutionary Legislation and Propaganda.The recently announced temporary suspension of immigration has met with general approval. The passage of the Bill, which will go far to allay the fears of the general public, seems probable. The reported influx of immigrants from Europe and the Near East had aroused considerable anxiety.The American State Department has issued in booklet form a description of the proceedings of the Moscow Conference of the Third International of December last. The object of the booklet is to prove that Russian officials, in their role as leaders of the Soviet, attempt to establish normal relations with governments which in the role of Communists and general managers of the world revolution they conspire to wreck.The Federated Press of America.The Federated Press of America, whose joint organiser is Louis P. Lochner, appears to be carrying out its functions and disseminating propaganda entirely anti-governmental in nature. Canadian revolutionary papers, following the example of the British-Columbian Federationists, are making considerable use of it. It is reported to be about to purchase a paper mill to guarantee a supply of paper for radical and communist newspapers.Costello, who is said to have had the help of his intimate friend, the notorious John de Kay, in organising the Federated Press, is desirous of returning to this country, from which he was deported in October last. He will incur the penalty of six months&apos; with hard labour should he attempt to do so.The Coloured Races.The negro question holds grim possibilities. The American census will probably show that negroes within the United States number 12 million or one-tenth of the whole population.    This proportion
increases daily. Many negroes have recently drifted northwards. In the south the white man is in the bare majority ; in some States not even that. No longer content to accept a policy of wholesale disfrau-enfranchisement and social ostracism, negroes view the means adopted to repress their ambitions with ever greater exasperation. Their ambitions also grow over-weening. Often hardworking and eager for education they believe that they have proved themselves the equals of the Whites. The methods by which, in spite of the famous amendment to the Constitution, the negro is deprived of his civil rights vary in different States. In North Carolina the &quot; Grandfather Clause &quot; still prevails, which disfranchises all whose grandfathers were not voters, thus handing on the disability from generation to generation. In other States the means of disfranchiseinent is the literary test) whereby, in addition to tho literary test proper, the voter has to explain a selected clause of the Federal Constitution, capable of different interpretations. Tho whole question carries potentialities of disaster, which will not allow themselves to bo ignored, and the present hostility of the negroes may weld them into a force difficult to grapple with.The American Red Cross in Europe.Tho peculiar activities of the American Red Cross in Europe merit attention. Presidents of that body who have found their uniform an asset in business are reluctant to discard it, and still more reluctant to lose their present salaries of 200,000 francs a year. They are accordingly reported to have transferred their activities from war to peace and to intend in future to devote themselves to the fight against typhus, tuberculosis, &amp;e. Their latest suggestion is that the Red Cross Societies of the world should be united in one body under American presidency. French refusal to unite with the Germans has been met by a suggested division into two groups : (ft) Denmark, Great Britain, Norway, and Holland, who will inviteGermany and Finland to join them. (h) France, the Mediterranean countries, and the Republics of SouthAmerica.At a recent conference at Copenhagen, Dr. Clarke, of the American Red Cross, with some difficulty persuaded Professor Hoefting, President of the Danish Red Cross, Professor Rasch and Thorwald Madsen to hold a venereal diseases conference for Northern Europe in May next, at which presumably it will be decided that the various countries concerned will be expected to contribute their share to the salaries of the American presidents. Political intentions are believed to lurk behind the scheme. Tbe separation of England and France has been brought &quot;about by the new grouping. America as President of both groups would not only have ample political opportunities, but would be enabled to further tho sale of American medicines throughout the world. On this point the French are likely to protest as Scandinavia on account of the Ioav value of the franc is an excellent market for French medicines.Sinn Fein.The threat of Mr. Harry Boland, secretary to Dc Valera, to call a vendetta against tbe English in the United States has aroused a storm of protest from Americans. Even Mr. Oswald Villard, the sponsor of the &quot; Committee of 100,&quot; which is at present inquiring into Irish conditions, protests against such a suggestion, and warns Irish-Americans that &quot;American interest in self determination for Ireland does not imply hostility to England.  .   .      .&quot;   Sinn Fein itself is becoming alarmed
at tho storm raised ; one of their circulars, while advising the friends of Ireland that Americans resent attacks on the British flag in the United States, suggests as a new point of attack England as the friend of Japan and as the &quot; world&apos;s oil grabber.&quot;Active aggression for the Irish cause is to be expected from a now secret society, the &quot; Fenian Order of the lied Cloak,&quot; recently founded in Washington. Only known and tried members of the Speakers&apos; Bureau are eligible for admission, and the greatest care is taken to scrutinise credentials before members are admitted to the meetings. At a meeting of the Speakers&apos; Bureau for Irish Independence, Jeremiah 0&apos;Leary recommended for special boycott Lipton&apos;s Tea, Dunlop Tyres, and O.T. Cotton Thread.Mr. 0&apos;Callaghau, Lord Mayor of Cork, has been ordered to leave the United States by February lltli.Orientals.At the first annual convention of the Friends of Freedom for India, the destruction of tho British Empire was discussed by revolutionaries from India, Ireland, Egypt, Mesopotamia, together with the Soviet government of Russia, and with Germany. Gorman aid was conditional on the recognition by the Germau government of the independence ot Asiatic peoples.A new Mahoininedan association, &quot; The Society for the Protection of Islam,&quot; has been started by Mufti Muhammad Sadiq in Chicago. Its object is to interest Americans in Islamic States, and so influence American diplomacy. Sadiq proposes to start a journal in English, and is in touch with American Congressmen from the Western States.The American authorities apprehended four Egyptian. Nationalists who arrived iu New York from Rotterdam, it is believed for propaganda purposes.   They were sent back to Brest.Miners.During the last few months more than 20 murders have taken place in connection with the disturbances in the West Virginia mines. Matters have gone from bad to worse since the early spring, but a strike was only formally declared on July 1st. At times the bitter industrial conflict has bordered on insurrection, and at the end of November Federal troops had to be sent to maintain order. The mine owners have declared a fight to the finish against unionising the Mingo County coal fields, and discharged such workers as had joined the locals. So far there are no signs of any possible settlement.11. CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES. MEXICO.Labour conditions remain far from reassuring. Labour appears well organised and to be upheld by the Federal Government, which, it is reported, has helped the Labour Clubs to obtain furniture and equipment and during the recent strike of policemen forbade the troops to inter-vene.   The posters of these clubs are violently &quot;red &quot; in character.Instead of granting large increases in wages the leading mining com-panies have reduced the prices in their Company Stores at which their employees buy nearly everything. Although the Compauies are at present heavy losers in consequence they rightly argue that this will right itself
as the pricss of commodities) drop, whereas wages ones raised cannot easily be cut down again.It is reliably reported that a member of the Mexican Consulate General in Berlin is frequently visited by John de Kay, the notorious revolutionary, who travels between Berlin and Budapest, and is the main supporter of the League of Oppressed Nationalities,12. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. ARGENTINE.A serious state of affairs prevails at present which shows no signs of abatement.   Strikes are numerous, some of the more serious being the agrarian strike in the cereal districts and the strike of the employees of the West India Oil Company, which may result in an alarming shortage of petroleum and naphtha in the capital.   Tho stagnation of the wool market has led to general trade depression in the National Territory of Santa Cruz, where labour agitation is rife.  The malcontents and agitators arc a relatively small minority, but they aro bent on making trouble in all trades and occupations in the Territory.   Even when escorted to their work by the police, men who are willing to work are threatened and have been fired on.   Employers have been warned of the probable destruction of their property by fire, sheep shearing is prevented by organised gangs of men, and business generally is virtually at a standstill.   The manager of the Royal Mail anticipated a general outbreak in January as the men know that in view of the elections in March there is little probability of repressive action on the part of the Government.The train-ferry service of the Entre Rios Company is still held up, and the interminable dispute of the Mihauovich Company, which has led to an almost total paralysis of the fluvial transport and passenger service, still drags on. The Ferry Boat Service strike was due to tho refusal of crews to carry for firms boycotted by the Federacion Obrera Maritima. The crews actually gave the directors a list of the only firms for which the Railway Company might accept cargo. The Company refused to submit to dictation. With the aid of naval crews the service Avas resumed, and there were rumours that the Railwaymen&apos;s Federation might intervene in a conciliatory spirit. Local farmers, traders, and industrialists, foiled in their attempts to settle the conflict, resolved to break off all negotiations with the Federacion Obrera Maritima and invited their workmen to resume their posts at their respective establishments. The intervention of the Government in the strike of the Ferry Boat Service caused considerable unrest both among the members of the Federation and in the Railwaymen&apos;8 Union and tho Argentine District Workmcu&apos;s Fede-ration. This action of the Government is in strong contrast with its toleration of the Federacion Obrera Maritima in the quarrel between the Directors of the Mihanovich Company and their employees.A combination of all the Port Societies is being secretly organised. These include the Watchmen&apos;s Society (&quot; Sociedad tie Resistencia de Sereuos&quot;), the Stevedores&apos; (&quot; La Sociedad de Estivadores Diqesy Darsenas &quot;) and other societies. The Royal Mail steamer &quot; Andes &quot; had to leave port recently without finishing bunkering as the Coal Heavers&apos; (&quot; Sociedad de Carboneros &quot;) refused to complete the coaling because the Royal Mail watchmen did not belong to the &quot; Sociedad de Serenos.&quot;Late in November it Avas reported that considerable unrest had appeared amongst the officers and troops at the manoeuvres in Campo Mayo; several companies of infantry disobeyed orders to parade, and a
political plan, described as anti-militarism, under a guise of Maximalism, was suspected. As a demonstration of disobedience the troops were to refuse to parade in Buenos Aires for the annual march past before the Government House after the manoeuvres. General Thomas Valloc, the principal agent in Ibis unrest, was ordered to retire.Sinn Fein was reported early in December to be planning an attack against the representatives of the British Government, British Shipping Companies and industrial establishments. Incendiary bombs were to be placed on board ships in port by the men employed to paint and repair them. Special animosity is shown against the royal Mail Company. An Italian, an anti-British partisan of Ireland, named Louis Alva, who lived for a long time in Turkey and acted as watchman for Messrs. Lamport and Holt, was intimately connected with these plans,
PART II,1. LENIN ON TRADE CONCESSIONS.Translation of a verbatim transcript of a speech delivered at a meeting of Secretaries of the Moscow Branches of the Communist Parti/, extracted from the &quot; Russian Press Review &quot;(No. 13, Decembers), a Soviet propaganda publication emanating from Moscow and circulated to extremist newspapers and organisations of all countries.A note has been handed to me with a question about concessions, with which I am going to doal.In one of his books the American Socialist Spargo, who is something after the style of our Alexinsky and who hates the Bolsheviki whole-heartedly, speaks about our concessions as proof of the collapse of Communism. This is the opinion alse of our Mensheviki. Let us look at the question from a business point of view. Who have suffered ruin  we or the European bourgeoisie ? The latter slandered us for three years, calling us usurpers and bandits; it tried by all means to vanquish us, and now it is forced to confess that it has not succeeded and this alone is a victory for us. The Mensheviki allege that we had under-taken single-handed to conquer the world bourgeoisie. We have always said, however, that we are but a link in the chain of world revolution, and have never made it our aim to vanquish capitalism by our efforts alone. The world revolution has not come yet, but neither are we beaten yet. Militarism is collapsing while we are growing stronger ; they, and not we, have suffered defeat.They now want to subject us by means of a treaty. While the revolution is not yet come, bourgeois capital is a sort of advantage to us. How can we accelerate the development of industry in a country industrially weak ? By aid of bourgeois capital. We have at present two projects for concession. One project is a treaty for conceding Kam-chatka for 60 years. An American multi-millionaire^ has been here and spoke very frankly about the motives of the treaty, viz., that America desires to have a base in Asia in case of war with Japan. This milliardaire* said that if we sell Kamchatka to America lie promises us such enthusiasm on the part of the population of the United States that the American Government will immediately recognise the Soviet Government in Russia ; if, on the other hand, we only let it on lease the enthusiasm will be less. He is now on his way to America to report that the Soviet Government is not half so black as she has been painted.* Italics by Directorate of Intelligence.-These phrases relate to the American adventurer Washington B. Vanderlip, who visited Moscow in August 1920, and would appear from LemVs words to have posed as Mr. Frank A. Vanderlip, the well-know American financier.0 AS 8671 - - f
We have up till, now beaten the world bourgeoisie because it could not unite. The Brest and Versailles Treaties have disunited them. A rabid enmity has now sprung up between America and Japan. We arc jjroinsr to take advantage of this and are going to lease Kamchatka instead of giving it away free ; after all, has not Japan annexed a huge piece of territory from us in the Far East ? It is most profitable for us to leaso Kamchatka and receive part of the product, the more so that we are really unable to avail ourselves^of, it or utilise it. The Treaty has not yet been signed, and it has been met by a fienzy of rage in Japan. By means of this Treaty we have still more aggravated the differences between our enemies.The second concession is that wo hand ovor a few million dessiatins of forest land in Archangel, which, in spite of all our endeavours, we are unable to exploit. There is to be a chess-board system of alternate holdings, so that side by side with the private leaseholdings there will be ours, which we will bo able to work while learning from them. This is all a great advantage to us.Now the last aspect of the question. Granting concessions docs not mean peace; it is tear, but in a different jo rm, a form more profitable for us. Before, tear was conducted by means of tanks, guns, fyc, which hindered our work; now the war will be carried on to the industrial front. It is likely thai they will try to establish the free private trade, bat they cannot conclude any treaty without us. They will be obliged to submit to all our laws ; our workers will learn from them, and, in the event of war-and for this contingency we should always be prepared against the bourgeoisie all the property reverts to us according to the rules of ivar. I say again that concessions are the continuation of the war on an industrial plane; but, instead of destroying, we develop our productive forces. Most undoubtedly they will attempt to cheat us and evade our laws, but for this purpose toe possess a responsible institution ifi the form of the All-Ilussian Extraordinary Commission, and we arc sure of&quot;victory.,*Fiighteen months ago we wanted to sign a peace by which a huge slice of territory would have remained with Deuikiu and Koltchak. They refused and lost all. We have correctly indicated the way to world revolution, but this is not a straight but a crooked pathf1 We have disarmed the bourgeoisie, and they cannot heat us by armed force. Before, they forbade us to carry on Communist propaganda ; now this [demand?] is dwindled down to nothing, and it would be ridiculous to demand, it. They arc undergoing internal disintegration, and this in its turn strengthens us.* We do not presume to be able to vanquish the bourgeoisie by armed force alone, and it is useless for Meusheviki to make this allegation, .We must take up the problems of industrial construction. The task is difficult after six years&quot; of war ; we must march forward in closed ranks on the principles of the resolutions adopted by tho Ail-Russian Cou-ference, which resolutions must be put into practice. We must set the example for the mass of non-party working men. I appeal to you for decision and energy in the execution of the difficult problem confronting.. ;      Italics by directorate of Intelligence, But see also Part L, p. 32, of this issue, the- ^Moscow Military.Councils, December 1.920, which, seems to show that the .-,transition from the Military.to&quot; the Trade &quot;-form&quot; was only temporary. -
2. SOVIET DIFFERENCES REGARDING CONCESSIONS TOCAPITALISTS.The Soviet Governments determination to grant concessions to foreign capitalists in all branches of trade and enterprise has not been arrived at without a struggle between the &quot;militant&quot; Communists led by Zinovieff and Dzerjinsky and supported by Bukhariu, Litvinoff, and Radek, and the &quot;Compromisers&quot; or &quot;Trade&quot; party led by Lenin and supported by Tchitcherin, Lunacharsky and Krassin with Trotsky apparently in au intermediate position. At the last Conference of Soviets in Moscow the question was brought up and Lenin&apos;s party secured the adoption of the principle that Soviet Russia should grant concessions to European capitalists, especially in those great circumferential tracts of country which she herself wss unable to exploit. In private, members of the trading party are unabashed in stating that such concessions as may be granted are, in spite of all agreements to the contrary, purely temporary in their nature and that tho Soviet authority will appropriate them as soon as the internal organisation of Russia enables it to do so.At first the Soviet Government paid particular attention to Dutch and Swedish Capitalists. Later came the famous offer to Mr. Vanderlip of the great coal and oil concessions in Kainschatka, as well as the less-known negotiations with the Standard Oil Company regarding concessions of Baku petrol, kerosene, and fuel for steamers to be delivered via Georgia and Batum. Finally, it appears, both from pronouncements by Lenin to a Conference of Women Bolsheviks in Moscow, and by the preparation of a book for circulation among the capitalists of all countries, wherein details of all available concessions are given, that concessions in Western Siberia and Northern Russia, including mining concessions in Siberia and concessions of land for growing corn and raising stock, will presently be thrown open to capitalist competition abroad. The book, based upon data taken from reports drawn up in the time of the Czar, is said to give a striking picture of the stupendous reserves which exist in Russia and Siberia ; it leaves one exceedingly important question untouched. The Bolsheviks do not discuss whether under the present Russian Govern-rhent any of the concessions they advertise could be worked profitably by foreigners. They speak of the 70,000,000 dessiatins of forest between Irtysh and the Obi in Western Siberia, of the 18,000,000 dessiatins of agricultural laud, and 85 dessiatins of timber in Northern Russia; of the concessions in the rich Kuznetsky basin, estimated to contain half the entire coal supply of Russia ; of the iron ore of Tolbesk ; of the Ekibas coal mine with its 35 milliard poods of coal, already, incidentally, the property of an English company. They also hold out concessions of over 3,000,000 dessiatins of land to foreigners who wish to engage in agriculture and the raising of cattle, and. lay down the conditions under which such concessions can be granted, including, in the last case, the most up-to-date machinery and the mutual arrangement for the transport of agricultural produce abroad. But they make no mention of how transport difficulties are to be overcome, and suggest no guarantee that once the Soviet regime is economically in the saddle it will not simply say to the &quot; capitalist&quot; exploiter, &quot; Begone, and think yourself lucky that you get out with a whole skin.&quot;And yet, even supposiug, against all information, that the trading party is sincere in its offers, only its defeat by the party of &quot;No Com-
promise&quot; with &quot;Capital&quot; would be required in order to effect some such consummation.At a meeting of the Central Soviet Committee towards the end of December, after Stokloff, president of the Central Soviet, had given a resume of the negotiations with Western Europe for agricultural machinery, &amp;c, Karl Radek got up and said (bat his party would not permit Soviet Russia to lie exploited by tho West European capitalists, lie said no honourable Communist would agree to the conditions demanded by Mr, Lloyd George, and that Russian workmen had not paid with their blood for the revolution to lot the people against whom they had fought pour into Russia and export everything they owned. Never should the West European bourgeois class begin the rebuilding of the Czarist regime on Russian soil.Bukharin also spoke, agreeing with Radek, and saying that if the Soviet Commissariat did not immediately recall Krassin from London and break off every connection with England, &quot; We shall lie forced to act alone.&quot; On Stekloff, a &quot;compromiser,&quot; calling out, &quot; Who nxeyouV Bucharin answered, &quot; We are the real Communists, who Lave fought and offered our lives in order to conquer our enemies&apos;.&quot; Stekloff replied, amid great excitement, &quot;If communication is not established now with &quot; Western Europe we shall soon not have a single piece of machinery, nor &quot; a piece of wrought iron, and that alone will cause us to fall to &quot; pieces,&quot; &quot;Rather go to pieces,&quot; answered Radek, &quot;than become lackeys to the capitalists.&quot;After the Conference Radek wrote to Lenin saying that though he had carried the day the Russian proletariat was absolutely opposed to his plan, and would never permit Soviet Russia to be terrorised by British capitalists : let Lenin keep his resolutions of last summer and compel England to act in accordance with the wishes of Soviet Russia. Radek proceeded, &quot;It is known to you that England has shown a tendency to &quot; agree to our conditions, and that Lloyd George has come to the &quot; conclusion that Soviet Russia has far too many supporters within the &quot; United Kingdom. England knows that the British workman is on &quot; our side and sympathises with our ideas. In case the British Govern-&quot; ment does not agree to our conditions regarding commercial relations &quot; with us, she will have great trouble at home, and it is possible that &quot; this may lead to a revolution. It is therefore our duty not to give &quot; way to the demands of the British capitalists, but to stick to our &quot; former conditions, which Lloyd George will be bound to accept in the &quot; end.&quot;On similar grounds the Communist Party at Vienna early in January sent a delegation to Moscow to urge Lenin to prevent the Soviet Govern-ment from agreeing to the conditions regarding trade with Russia laid down by the West European capitalists.To sum up, any investment in properties &quot;conceded by the Soviet Government&quot; is, to say the least of it, a hazardous undertaking.3. THE WHITE RUSSIAN CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY : SOCIAL REVOLUTIONARIES, CADETS, REACTIONARIES,The Conference of the Constituent members of the White Russian Constituent Assembly took place in Paris in the second half of January. The Social Revolutionaries are reported to be in favour of a cessation, once and for all, of every type of Intervention. To the Cadet section of the Assembly, on the contrary, Intervention still remains a possibility in happier circumstances.
A compromise has been arrived at between tbe two parties, who have decided to resist to. tlie uttermost tlie recognition by any Power of the Soviet Government and the conclusion of trading agreements or com-mercial treaties between Russia and European Powers.The trading agreement between Great Britain and Soviet Russia as the first in importance, the model, and the precedent of all such agreo-ments, especially incurs the hostility of the Assembly, which is arranging for declarations to bo signed by all emigres that the Russia of the future will disavow this agreement or any treaty based upon it. Measures are also being concerted to bring home to Parliaments and Ministers of the Entente the worthlessness for Europe of trade with Russia. Propaganda will also be instituted to the effect that trade with Russia is as possible without as with cither an agreement or a treaty. The general policy, in fact, upon which both parties of the Constituent Assembly appear united, is that the blockado should be raised without the conclusion of trading agreements or commercial treaties, a course to all intents and purposes identical with that to which the French and American Governments already stand committed. The Cadets and the Social Revolutionaries in agreeing to this policy are no doubt moved by the fear that once com-mcrcial agreements or treaties are signed with Soviet Russia by the various Powers their own divisions will be accentuated by tho removal of a proximate objective which they are at one in attacking. They believe that the signature of agreements or treaties would act as a dissolvent upon themselves both in this respect and by driving the more infirm among the Whites to make their peace with the Soviet Government.Kerensky, in his recent negotiations with M. Millerand in Paris, is reported to have been trying to persuade the French to abandon all impossible Generals and definitely to accept the views of the Social Revolutionary Party. Kerensky has asked the French to withhold all funds from Bermoudt and Skoropadsky, whom the French were thinking of backing against Soviet Russia in the spring, until Kerensky and his friends have been given scope for the exercise of their policy. Kerensky was, in December, under the impression that the French would agree to this in view of the Wraugel fiasco. Kerensky himself was acting at the instance of the Social Revolutionary leaders in Prague, who have dis-covered that the proofs produced by Trebitsch Lincoln that Biskupski deliberately cheated and misled them after promising to delay further activities in another direction, and have decided not to take similar risks again, but to extort a definite promise from the French to postpone the Bermondt affair.The Prague Social Revolutionaries have also obtained a promise from Kerensky that if their revolution is successful he will not demand or try to seize the leadership for himself. Kerensky is believed to see the justice and necessity of this and to have acceded to conditions which are the only ones upon Avhich the Social Revolutionaries will use his name and services.4. THE ATTITUDE OP THE INTELLIGENTSIA IN SOVIET RUSSIA.The following report is drawn up on the strength of conversation with more than 100 persons of various professions, belonging to the Russian Intelligentsia in or on the borders of Russia.After the defeat of General Wrangel, and the later successes of the Bolsheviks against Generals Permikin and Balakhovitch, the attitude of the Intelligentsia remaining in Soviet Russia underwent a sharp change. Any hopes that they had on White fronts fell.   Military intervention
supported by the Allies they came to regard as absolutely hopeless. Allied support to White fronts they attribute to avarice and believe that the Allies intend to emaciate Russia until foreign capital can seize and control the economic life and the industries of the country.The Russian Intelligentsia in Soviet Russia is now divided into two groups. The first comprises persons who formerly occupied various responsible posts and politically formed tho Conservative elements. Its aim is to work in conjunction with the Bolsheviks, and by peaceful efforts to improve the general conditions of life. This group is not Communistic. It is constantly fighting for its rights and privileges, and endeavours to smooth over any disagreements with the authorities \hy adducing proofs that its work lias helped the movement. It is further trying to get responsible posts into its hands, and to introduce new principles into life under the Soviet regime, At its instance, the House Committees of the Poor have now been replaced by House Committees of Workers ;&apos;from January 1st all citizens were to receive equal rations, and categories to be abolished. As a product of its work members of this group also cite the recent inclusion of school masters, engineers, artists, &amp;c, in the Soviets.This group states that it is possible to bring about au improvement in the general conditions of life without any White fronts and without any outside intervention. As an example, they give the Republic of the Far East, which, after the liquidation of the armies ofKoltchak and Semenoff, recognised the Soviet authorities and declared itself to be independent-There, thanks to the work of the Intelligentsia elements, a Constituent Assembly is being called on the principle of an equal and secret universal vote.The group shares the growing &quot; national&quot; sentiment engendered in Russia by the &quot;treachery&quot; of the Allies. A member of it, Comrade Aiitsellovitch, President of the Soviet of Professional Unions, referred at a recent meeting to the attitude of the Allies towards Russia, and concluded &quot;for 150 years British policy has been directed towards the destruction of Russia.&quot;Antsellovitch is an idealist Bolshevik and an old fellow-champion of Lenin and Zinovieff. The speech of Comrade Antsellovitch was very well received by the Intelligentsia Soviet workers. This information was obtained from one of the members of the Petrograd Soviet, who was present at the meeting.The second group is comprised of irreconcilable enemies of the Soviet Authorities, who can see no possible profit in joint work with the Bolsheviks. All their hopes are directed towards the creation of a new White front in the spring and they are ready to afford such a front every assistance in the rear. This group presents in itself the Intelligentsia of Liberal tendencies of the old times. It loaths the Allies as heartily as the first or Conservative group.Owing to the widely developed espionage system and general mistrust there can be no union on any large scale. The representatives of both streams work in small scattered bodies, out of touch with one another, and without guiding organs. All such persons are very closely watched by the Soviet Authorities, who attach so-called &quot;political-workers &quot; to all Institutions, whose duty it is to watch the employees.It will be astonishing if the first or Conservative group meets with any success. Such success as may have been its lot hitherto is only temporary. Soviet rule has brought about such general disintegration and decay that no efforts of the Intelligentsia can save the country.The attraction of foreign capital, by augmenting the hostility towards foreigners and kindling the national spirit, will make the situation worse.
Strange as it may appear, the Russian Intelligentsia is loud in its protests about the admission of foreign, in the absence of Russian, capital. In this they are in complete agreement with certain seel ions of the Bolsheviks, all of whom, as is known, look upon all treaties with bourgeois countries as &quot;,bits of paper,&quot; and some of whom will not admit even so frail an infringement as these, of the sacred principles of Communism.5. CLERICAL DIVISIONS IN GREECE.The return of King Constantino has contributed to throw the affairs of the Greek Church into great confusion,In the Orthodox Church there are the three Patriarchs of Oonstauti-noplo, Alexandria and Jerusalem, not to speak of Antioch, which is schismatical. The first Patriarch is not supremo, but only &quot;primus inter pares.&quot;   His views, that is, carry great weight, but are not commands.The Church in Greece is, however, autecephalous, having its own head, the Metropolitan of Athens ; further the Kingdom includes the autocepbalous Church of Crete. Macedonian Bishops are under the Patriarch of Constantinople.Trouble has arisen between tho Greek Government and the Patriarch over the deposition by the Greek Government of Meletios, Metropolitan of Athens. Meletios had replaced Theocletos, the Royalist Metro-politan, who had excommunicated Venizelos, and had thereafter, been regularly deposed by a proper Church Synod. The new Government, however, refused to take the oath of accession before Meletios and recalled Thcoceletos from the Monastery to which he had been banished. Eleven other Bishops, who had also bean deposed, were likewise recalled.As the depositions were legal by Church law, the Government was by the same token acting illegally. Meletios appealed to Queen Olga. Both she and King Constantiue rejected his appeal.Meletios then appealed to Constantinople. There the Patriarchal throne is vacant, and Dorotheos, the acting Patriarch, who is a strong Venizelist, forthwith proposed to, excommunicate Constantine for his breach of Church laws.While not having the weight of a Papal excommunication in the Roman Catholic Church, such an excommunication would still have been of power to make it unpleasant for the King. The Greek Government telegraphed a protest to Dorotheos, who for the time withheld his excommunication.In Constantinople, however, Veuizelos, &quot; Elevtherios, the most honoured Father of our race,&quot; is still prayed for.The Greek Government then assembled a Synod at Athens to settle the question. Nine Venizelist Bishops attended. The eleven, deposed Bishops, the question of the legality of whose deposition was to be voted on, first insisted on sitting on the grounds that the deposition was obviously illegal, and then voted it so, outvoting the other nine. They, therefore, along with the Metropolitan, are now restored to their original charges.The Government have now cut off the monthly subsidy of 60,000 drachmas which they used to allow Constantinople, where, however, it is being collected by the local Venizelists.Quite recently the Holy Synod and the Lay Council of the CEcumenieal telegraphed to M. Venizeios asking him to assume the defence of the &quot; Unredeemed &quot; Greeks at the forthcoming London Conference.Printed by Etke and Spottiswoode, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.0,4,
