Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.Teleqmm from Viceroy, Jlome Department, to Secrctaru of Stale for India, dated17th February .192.1.Following is weekly telegram :--Section 1. Functions in connection with war memorial and laying ol&apos; foundation stone of Legislative Chambers passed oil&quot; very successfully.Section 2, Punjab debate passed oil&apos; very satisfactorily. Resolution moved by Jamnadas Dwarkadas was as follows: (I) To declare the firm resolve of the Government of India to maintain that the connection of India with the British Empire is based on the principle of equal partnership and perfect racial equality, Indian lives and Indian honour being held as sacred as British lives and honour ; (2) to record his opinion and express regret that the martial law administration in the Punjab of 1919 departed from these principles, and was calculated to deeply wound the self-respect of the Indian population by subjecting them to unnecessary hardship and humiliation ; (3) to mete out deterrent punishments to officers who were found guilty of improper exercise of their powers, and to take steps to relieve the Indian revenue of all payments towards the pensions, gratuities, or compassionate allowances to such officers; and (4) to satisfy himself that adequate compensation is awarded to the families of those killed or injured at the Jallianwalla Bagh or other places on the same scale as the compensation awarded in the case of Europeans who suffered or were killed during the Punjab disturbances, lie moved resolutions in admirable and moderate speech. After discussion, in which home member and Commander-in-Chief took part, moved proposal withdrawal of clause 3, and this was carried without a division. Remaining clauses were then carried unanimously. As regards last clause, home member intimated that Government of Punjab would be asked to deal generously with cases of persons and relatives of persons imjured and killed at Jallianwalla Bagh. General tone of debate very good, and Government may congratulate itself on result.Madras.-Liltie of interest to record about non-co-operation. A marked decrease in activities of leaders. Attempts to persuade students to follow, example oi Calcutta have hitherto met with no great success, but there are evidences that campaign is about to be intensified. Students Non-co-operation Association formed, and premises secured for National College. At present there is no reason to apprehend that spread of Calcutta contagion will be serious. In districts, non-co-operation movement made little progress among students, though from two districts it is reported that some students have left their work. In Malabar political leaders are embarking on a campaign for tenancy reform. The movement is fraught with considerable potentialities, and (? give)s room for some anxiety, though so far practically no progress made. Both Khilafat and Nationalist Committees at Madras have resolved that the elections for municipalities and local boards should be exempt from the ban governing participation in the Legislative Council elections. The men went back to work at Buckingham Mills, and everything is now proceeding smoothly.Bengal.-School situation fully reported in separate telegram. Below the surface things did not go quite so smoothly for non-co-operation during J)uke&apos;s visit as they hoped. Transport was not paralysed, the Hartal was only (? partially) successful, and failed as demonstration-students began to get uneasy at complete absence of arrange-ments to employ them or continue their education. Das&apos; change of front suggested to be due to fact that Gandhi has convinced him that non-co-operation movement has now progressed so far that British Government is (? beaten), and does not oppose it. A matter of striking demonstrations of power with continued Hartals will suffice to bring Government to its knees, and cause it to surrender in next few months. On these lines Swaraj will be gained in one year. Idea is that Gandhi clings to Swaraj as mental discipline, and believes, when Government has surrendered, western civilisation will go with it. He still shrinks from violence, though admits it as a. probable consequence if Government do not yield quickly. He is anxious to postpone evil day, but indicates that he believes it to be inevitable.&apos; Das not averse to violence in early stages, but has no wish to bring about chaos. Pal and Ali Brothers look forward to violence as first step in&apos; programme of forcibly destroying present Government, but wish to postpone until it can be general and effective. At recent 3411 &apos; 100 2.21
election in Tipperah, an illiterate fruit-seller was set up as candidate for Legislative Council, but, in spite of rigorous (? vigorous) effort of school boys and non-co-operators, was defeated by young Zamindar.Bombay. Intense campaign on platform and in Press to induce students to leave schools and colleges throughout the month of January. Not more than 50 or GO boys actually left in Bombay in early stages, but latterly movement has had considerable success. Ail colleges seriously affected, and excitement spreading to Poona and Konkan. Mow far registration of would-be non-co-operators due to ebullition of feeling, which will evaporate when students called on to leave colleges, difficult to say.Belvi of Belgaum has retired from the non-co-operation movement again. Under pressure from Gandhi he had given up practice as a pleader, but since his return from Nagpur Congress has resumed practice and fallen out with leaders of non-co-operation movement. Five Mohamedan J ustices of the Peace reported to have resigned office. Non-co-operators are getting at the Bhils with ostensible object of taking up temperance and forced-labour questions, but elements of danger in movement owing to inflammability of these people. From a few districts reports show that difficulty may be experienced in collecting land revenue. There has been partial failure of crops in these districts, and movement is possibly attempt to secure usual remissions of revenue. Social boycott is being brought to bear to force servants to leave the service of landlords.Section o. Three days&apos; Hartal observed at Sukkur during visit of Commissioner, Sind, owing to income tax grievances. Lajpat Rai, the President Elect of All-India Railwaymen&apos;s Conference, has resigned, and Baptista has also vacated chairmanship of Reception Committee, owing to strong feeling amongst the railwaymen, who apparently refuse to identify promoters with political parties. Railway strike on Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway has been separately reported.Section 4. United Provinces. Attempts are being made to boycott an important district exhibition in Moradabad. Agitation against provision of supplies and carriages to officers on tour is prominent in places. Schoolmasters, Patwaris; Chaukidars and students show restiveness; though with first three classes trouble mainly economic.Section 5. Students at Benares again move, organising non-co-operation against educational institutions encouraged by visit from Gandhi; 200 men in Ouclh and Rohilkhund workshop struck work on the 10th. Attempts made to hold, up mail train outside station and interfere with the mail train driver, who was injured. City magistrate struck in face by brick. Commissioner on arrival found two Indian barristers addressing large mass meetings. Police arrangements made to enable trains to proceed. Many left work owing to intimidation. Commissioner reports trouble temporary and will subside. Crowd, estimated in press message at about 70,000, probably an exaggeration, drawn from Lucknow and surrounding districts, assembled to hear Gandhi, who addressed railway strikers, saying he could not advise them to strike or not to strike. Addressing students, told them to take to spinning wheel. Muhammad Ali, speaking to students, declared that if they fail to adhere to movement, India will get Swaraj by aid of agriculturists.Section 6. Bihar and Orissa. In recent weekly telegrams we have drawn attention to increased vigour in non-co-operative movement, but latest news from Commissioner of Tirhat Division chiefly concerned, shows a distinct change for better. A very welcome fall of rain improved agricultural prospects and sent the raiyats to their fields. In Bhagalpnr Division, on the other hand, situation not improved. Movement appears to be spreading in two districts, and temperance movement referred to in previous reports in full swing. Latter has been characterised by certain amount of intimidation and picketing of the liquor shops. New excitement in educational centres in Bihar and Orissa. At request of Minister of Education, instructions issued to the district magistrates that when intimidation or other unlawful means of discouraging students are attempted, police protection should be given if asked for by responsible educational, authority. Already reported from. Muzaffarpnr that an improvement is noticeable as result of action taken. Attempts being made to stir up disaffection among Dafadars and Chaukidars. &quot;Bihar Provincial League formed under auspices of Hassam Imam, which will provide means whereby many persons hitherto inclined to extreme views in politics, but definitely opposed to non-co-operation, may give utterance to their opinions. Babu. Dip Narayan. of Bhagalpur visited coalfields, and announced that non-co-operative and labour
associations would be formed, It is thought that development foreshadowed in. Nagpur Congress Resolution on the eve of fulfilment, and that labour will be exploited for political ends.   At moment, however, situation seems to be quiet.Section 7. Assam. Students caught the strike contagion from Calcutta, but no forcible obstruction to boys wishing to attend -school, or any other breach of peace. Feeling about Khilafat question very strong in. Surma Valley, and Mohammedan officers on tour frequently asked to resign.North-West Frontier Provinces. No developments in political, situation. Several agents of Swadeshi goods from down&apos; country noticed in Peshawar, but met with very little success in procuring orders. Several M alias in Malisud country definitely preaching non-co-operation, and dissuading tribesmen from taking Government contracts and from supplying Government troops. Jan Muhammad Junejo, who headed Siud Muhajarin, arrived in Peshawar oi route Afghanistan, with ostensible purpose of: taking relief to the destitute Indian Muhajarin. All will not be allowed to cross frontier. Syed Habih Gul, editor Siasat, who delivered inflammatory speeches at Dera Ismail Khan, has been removed across Indus as he was intending to proceed to Bannu. Lai a La j pat Rai also excluded under Defence of India Rules. Information received that lie was to address a large meeting at Peshawar, and, in view of Hindu and Sikh quarrel inevitable, excitement would be dangerous to public safety. Notice under rule sent. La j pat Rai apparently did not attempt to cross Indus. Should he -do so will be stopped.Delhi. - Owing to enforcement of Seditious Meetings Act, large number of Delhi citizens on 9th held meeting at Chaziabad, United Provinces, under presidency of Dr. Ansari. Resolutions were passed declaring that new Legislatures did not represent people iu any way, repudiating Delhi municipal address, reaffirming non-co-operation resolution, and approving villaging organisations and enlistment of volunteers for Swaraj propaganda as propounded by Congress. Gandhi arrived Delhi on 12th, and reported, to be likely to open Arya Vedic Institute on 14th.Punjab. As a result of serious rioting between Sikhs in Golden Temple, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, some 24 people received injuries, one being killed. Case registered under section 140 Indian Penal Code. In view of the recent troubles connected with some of the Sikh shrines the Punjab Government decided to move Legislative Council to appoint a Committee to examine question generally and to propose state legislation.Section 8.--Conditions in Central Sikh districts continue to cause anxiety. Gandhi about to visit Lahore and Amritsar according to latest information.Section 9. General.-Following are main comments of leading Indian papers on Duke&apos;s personal appeal in inaugurating Indian legislature. Leader.&apos;Speech, though not startling was inspired with spirit of goodwill. Amrita Bazar Parrika says Royal message is barren and is not capable of soothing lacerated heart of India. Tribune says British statesmanship has lost au opportunity of conciliating India through mouth&apos;of Royalty which will be recorded by History as among its greatest blunders. Vernacular Press of Bombay expressed disappointment at Duke&apos;s speech and King&apos;s message, which they say have utterly failed to produce any pacifying influence. English-owned and moderate India-owned papers comment very favourably on speech. General effect of personal appeal on those who heard it already reported.Section 10. How deep this feeling has penetrated will be tested on 15th, when we will debate in Legislative Assembly on the question.General situation is as reported in concluding portion of last wreek&apos;s telegram. Replies are beginning to come in from Local Governments to letter which was summarised in telegram of 29th January, and. on receipt of these we shall review-whole position and. formulate measures to be taken.
