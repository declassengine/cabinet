IS DQOUIJgTO IS ?H3 PHOPgRTY OF HIS 3RHANMK) ;&amp;J5STY&apos;S GOV^jeSMT) SSOR3T. 00FY No,0 A B IN B T,DISCONTINUANCE OF TH3 MINISTER OP--Iht^ot;---^-Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.Tho Shipping Controllers Memorandum (C.P.2598) does not in ray Judgment advance any adequate reason why tho Admiralty Transport Department, now incorporated in the Ministry of Shipping, and the distinctively Admiralty portion of the work mentioned by himj should riot revert entirely to the Admiralty.It Ms all along been understood, and is contemplated by the Act establishing the Ministry of Shipping, that at the end of the war1 this Would be the case*The work to which I refer is the following(1)   liilitary and Naval transport work for the   conduct of which by the Admiralty Transport Department the Board of Admiralty has remained responsible *. and still is responsible, but Wnich the Shipping Controller proposes to transfer elsewhere.(2)   The management of vessels, such as Oilers, Colliers, etc, for the service of the Fleet.IvhUitary and Naval transport worlt, both in this countryand abroad, has always been mainly carried out &quot;by NavalTransport Officers.   Ivfoch of this work on foreign stationshas ib cessarily to be done under the general superintendence ofthe Senior Naval Officers of the stations.   From the natureof the work it is clearly the most convenient arrangementthat the central administration should be under the directionof the Board of Admiralty.   When, owing to the great increasein the requisitioning of vessels for carrying supplies forthe Government and the Allies, the Ministry of Shipping was created in&apos;1917, the direction of the transport work wasspecifically retained by the Admiralty.   The instructions issued ..
isguod explained that the Admiralty remained responsible for all &quot;essentially Naval work,&quot; and this terra was interpreted as including, intor alia, all Military servioes connected with the sea-transport of overseas expeditionary forces, the management of requisitioned vessels employed on Naval services, and tho control, &amp;cM of the Naval Transport Staff.   Those instructions still remain in force&apos;.   The provision of Military transport by the Director of Transports on behalf of the tfar Office has always worked -with great smoothness and goodwill in tho pasts and the Admiralty have not heard that the Army Council desire any change.As regards the management of Admiralty-owned and Chartered Oilers and Colliers, the Admiralty are far from satisfied with the way in which the work has been oarried out, which has shown that an independent Department cannot keep in sufficiently close touch with day-to-day requirements to serve the Fleet efficiently.   In particular, the Admiralty are convinced that the prosent system, under which the management of the Admiralty Oilers has been turned over to a Commercial Firm as &quot;middlemen,&quot; is expensive and inefficient, and they are anxious to resume- their direct management as early as possible.   I understand that the Shipping Controller will raise no objection to this, whatever the decision be on his main proposals.GENERAL LIQUIDATION OF MINISTRY OF SHIPPING- ffAH /fORK. The Admiralty regard it as not very material under which Department this work should be placed until it is finis 1b d. All that is required is a Parliamentary and Ministerial Chief, as presumably the staff hitherto engaged on the work will remain until.it is finished.   It Fight be left to the -Treasury to decide which Department should accept responsibility /
responsibility.NE3D FOR MORE DEFINITE STTPWISION OF TUB GENERAL OF TIE MERCHANT SERVICE.The Admiralty concur and have long been of opinion that the ferine Department of the Board of Trade should be charged with a definite responsibility for supervising the general interests of the British Mercantile Marine, instead of merely administering the Merchant Shipping Acts, A separate Ministry does not seem to be required, and it is a mistake to suppose that this is the function of foreignMinistries of Marine, which are in reality the foreign Admiralties.    But the proposal that the Department responsible for the supervision of the interests of the Mercantile Marine should also be entrusted with the work of chartering and managing Government Ares sols seems to theAdmiralty to be wrong in principle.     A Department whioh itself is engaged in business should not be responsible for the general care and protection of that business.   A Department which is responsible for the observance of the Factory Acts should not itself manage factories.   Uor should the Department to which the Mercantile I far lie looks for protection and advice itself be engaged in shipping business. If it is so engaged, it cannot expect to be regarded as adisinterested arbiter and protector.To sum up, I propose that the Naval and transport work of the Ministry of Shipping should revert to the admiralty on 1st April nest, and that the general supervision of the interests of the Mercantile Marine should be undertaken bythe Board of Trade.(Intd.)
