(P 985) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 2085Wtii February 1921.(Received .18th, 3 p.in.)209 S.   Following from Dobbs, dated 15th February&quot;On 13th February, Tarsi, having learnt that motors had crossed the frontier, sent Amininizam to tell me that it was not impossible that Afghan Government might accept settlement of tribal questions on general lines of my private draft, but they must * first know British intentions regarding other clauses o? Afghan draft Treaty. Although I still consider that the best tactics would be to get Afghanistan first to accept our view definitely regarding tribes,! decided, in deference to the Secretary, of State&apos;s instructions, to comply with Tarsi&apos;s suggestion. 14th February Nawab and I had private meeting with Tarsi and Amininizam. I said that, in view of impasse reached at official meeting of 2nd February, I could not reopen the official conversations and go officially through other draft clauses, unless I first put forward officially my draft clause 8, hitherto only privately mooted, and received some kind of official assurance that its acceptance was possible. On the other hand, if Tarsi could give me a private assurance to the same effect, I was prepared to inform him at private conferences of British, views on other clauses, and, if possible, to arrive at private agreement on those clauses. Whole draft treaty thus privately agreed upon could be then rapidly reconsidered at official conferences. If no private agreement could be reached, we should revert to official impasse of 2nd February, and British Mission would leave. I asked him which course he would prefer. (? He replied) &apos; private conferences.&apos; &quot;Second part follows. . -
From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Depart incut, 201617th February 1921.(Received13 pan.)Clear the line.2.13 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   My immediately preceding telegram,   Following from Dobbs: &quot; Part 2. He then said he could give me a private -assurance that Afghanistan would accept settlement on the lines of my private draft (wording of which, I explained, might require, modification under instructions from my Government) if satisfied as to other clauses. He said almost in so many words that it was all question of money, and repeated Persian line &quot;let us have less tact and more money.&quot; He said also Afghanistan was in great difficulty and did not know where to turn.&apos; I then promised to hasten whole treaty at a series of private conferences, but said I must have few days to get my ideas and proposals clear. I will telegraph my proposals as soon as possible. It is evident that light will be now about financial assistance, and it would save time if I could know early, first, whether it would be permissible to base subsidy, in order to save Afghan amour-propre, mainly on services rendered by Habibulla in preserving neutrality; second, whether any increase is within bounds of possibility in view of increase in the cost of commodities, and of the fact that the Afghans do not now ask for any assistance in kind proposed/in aide-memoire,&quot; 3. Whether it could date from conclusion of the Rawalpindi Treaty ? I would not, of course, suggest any of the foregoing concessions without a severe struggle. I trust that the procedure of the private conferences will not be objected to. My experience of Tarsi, at Mussoorie shows it is the only way to get an agreement. At the-beginning of the meeting I confronted Tarsi with our latest information regarding Jamars plans, receipt of the treasure for distribution among the tribes, &amp;c, and said that if his activities were allowed during the negotiations, it might bring them to premature end. Tarsi pretended ignorance, but offered to arrange another meeting of me and Jamal, at which I can talk to him straight on the subject. I said L: thought this would be useful.&quot;Pobbs has been asked to submit proposal in more, concrete form,,
