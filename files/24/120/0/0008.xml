W.-E.The War Office,19th February, 1921.I. Present Situation in European Russia and Caucasia. i. With the annihilation of General WrangeFs Army in the crimea, and the elimination of the West Russian and Ukrainian levies, which were operating east of the new Poland frontier, the Soviet Government have disposed of all organized adversaries. The Bolsheviks are contending with wide-spread hostility on the part of the peasant population, which causes them considerable embarrassment. This peasant hostility is not, however, organized, and it appears at present to take the form of passive resistance to Soviet administration. It cannot, at present, be regarded as a serious menace to the stability of the Moscow Government.Although the immediate object of the Soviet Government must be to remedy the terrible economic condition of their country, there are few signs yet that they are prepared to sacrifice their aim of world wide revolution, which they are seeking to attain by propaganda aided by military pressure where circumstances are favourable.2. Oh the Russian Western front the recognition by Russia of the independence of Finland, Esthonia and Latvia has left her with a seaboard of but 80 miles in the Gulf of Finland which, moreover, is closed by ice for a great part of the year. Such a situation must be intolerable to a great nation, and although Russia is too much occupied at present to attack the new States, there can be no doubt that she must eventually burst out to an ice free seaboard on the Baltic, absorbing in so doing the States of Latvia, Esthonia and Lithuania either with or without their concurrence, or the concurrence of anybody else.3. Poland though she has successfully resisted the Bolshevik attack and has imposed a peace on Russia which gives her more territory than the Allies were prepared to grant her, makes no attempt to conceal the fact that she regards the peace as only a truce. Though each State suspects the other and appears to be firmly convinced that the conflict will be renewed, it is more probable that Russia will be the aggressor. There is a ready-made casus belli at any time in the Zeligovski movement which, notwithstanding official denials, Poland has apparently supported. Coupled with these dangers is the fact that Poland blocks trade between Germany and Russia, which is probably an essential element in the economic reconstruction of Germany.It is the accepted policy of Great Britain and her Allies to maintain the independence of Poland as defined by the Treaty of Versailles,-and should Russia attack Poland we must be prepared to receive a new demand for assistance. It must always be remembered that a land-locked Poland with no independent access to the sea is militarily unsupportable and helpless commercially.In the Caucasus the Bolshevists, though still hampered by risings of the Cossack peoples in their rear, mutinies of their troops and by revolts in Daghestan, have installed a Soviet Government in Azerbaijan which is independent^ only in name. There are, however, unconfirmed reports that feeling against the Soviet Government is gaining ground in Azerbaijan among the Tartars. Meanwhile, the Azerbaijan Government  has  allowed  the   Bolshevik  troops freedom  of movement through(B21/100)   100  2/21  H&amp;S,Ltd.  8975wo
their country, an opportunity which the Government of Russia turned to account by combining with the forces of the Turkish leader Kiazim Kara Bekir to enforce the submission of Armenia (but see paragraph 7).Georgia alone remains, and there can be no doubt but that she will fall into the Russian-system on the same terms as the Azerbaijan Republic in default of assistance from the Entente Powers or open support from a reconstructed Turkey. When this is accomplished, the Tiflis Baku railway and its extension to Alexandropol will be at Russia&apos;s disposal, and she will be free to move troops to the old Turkish frontier as in 1914.5. The situation in Persia and Trans-Caspia has been dealt with inmany papers and it is unnecessary to do more than repeat that we must anticipate the eventual reinforcement of the Russian forces on the southern shores of the Caspian and a possible advance into Persia from Enzeli, Tabriz and Astarabad, which it is probable the British force in North-West Persia has momentarily prevented.II. Present Situation in Turkey in Asia.G. The Turkish Government has delayed ratification of the Peace Treaty, and in the meantime three important events have occurred, namely, the defeat of Armenia, the elimination of Wrangel, and the political overthrow of Venizelos. The Turks must now be elated, and are represented by a body of able and persistent adventurers who will not fail to turn to full account any opportunity which is offered. It may be instructive to remember in this connection Enver&apos;s return march to Adrianople in 1913. This he was able to make owing to the outbreak of hostilities between the erstwhile allies Greece and Bidgaria.7. The two militant Turkish parties which Tjre working for the revision of the Treaty of Sevres are : (a.) The Committee of Union and Progress, headed by Enver and Talaat. (6.) The Nationalists, headed by Mustafa Kemal.Although the Committee of Union and Progress, as represented by E nver, Talaat and Jemal, have apparently thrown in their lot, for the time being, with the Bolsheviks, recent reports show that they are not quite satisfied with the Bolshevik programme as far as it affects Turkey.In an interview, dated the 2nd September, 1920, with an agent, Talaat, after giving a romantic reason for Turkey&apos;s action in joining the Central Powers, states that the Treaty of Sevres was driving the Turkish Nationalists into the arms of the Bolsheviks, and that Enver had been given carte blanche to organize Moslems from Turkestan and to incite them to embarrass England in the East. He, Talaat, did not approve of the conditions which the Soviet Government was anxious to impose, but had no fear of Bolshevik propaganda among the Mohammedans. He considered that his influence was sufficient to put an end to the unrest in the East, and that the struggle of Europe against Bolshevism would be made easier by the support of the Mohammedan Republics bordering on Russia, by which he no doubt meant Azerbaijan, Daghestan, Turkestan and perhaps also Persia and Turkey itself. He could count on the support of the Mohammedan inhabitants living in Russia, and considered that the permission to organize these territories granted to Enver was a weapon which lie, Enver, could use more readily against Moscow than with Moscow.Although this is obviously meant for British consumption, yet the mere fact that Tallaat wishes Great Britain to hear these views shows that he looks upou the Turko-Russian alliance with some aliarm and may be willing to join England against Russia, provided he gets back to power. In this connection it is worth noting that Jemals envoy to Mustafa Kemal, apparently expressing the formers views, stated that, provided the Allies agreed to certain modifications in the terms of the Treaty of Sevres, all Turks were willing to come to terms with them.The evidence in our possession appears to warrant the conclusion that the Nationalists, though still anxious to secure Russian money, arms and ammunition, and also to intrigue with and to obtain assistance from Italy, have -found that the use of Russian forces to recover Armenia has proved a double-edged weapon. The Russians, who feared a junction between the Nationalists and the Azerbaijanis, as a result of Kiazim-Kara-Bekir&apos;s, rapid advance into Armenia in November, 1920, retaliated by Bolshevising what was left of Armenia. Nationalist uneasiness at the gradual Bolshevik penetration into Anatolia appears to be steadily increasing, while the Bolshevik hold over the Nationalists seems to be stronger.
While maintaining an outward semblance of unanimity of purpose, the Russians and both militant Turkish parties appear jealous of each other. The Russians are playing for a Russian Trans-Caucasia, and Russian influence in Anatolia. The Committee of Union and Progress are playing for the consolidation of all the Turkish speaking races (in fact for Pan-Turanian ism). The Nationalists are fighting for an independent Turkey. Both Turkish parties hope to be able to throw off the Russian connection after attaining their ends.8. In dealing with the Turks it will be well to remember that Mustafa Kemal and Enver are rivals, that Enver has already been discredited by the Entente, and that his influence is probably greater in Russia than in Turkey itself. Any arrangement that is made with Turkey will have to be carried through with a representative Government, and this can only be obtained by amalgamating &quot; Young Turks&quot; and &quot; Old Turks.&quot; A. new head will be necessary, and it seems probable that this will best be provided by Mustafa Kemal himself, whose recognition should have the effect of driving Enver and Jemal into obscurity or finally into the arms of Russia to carry on their intrigues and personal ambitions in Central Asia, thus eliminating their influence on the Turkish problem proper.III. Existing Military Resources oe  A. Russia.B.-Turkey and Trans-Caucasia.A. Russia.9. The relative military resources of Russia and her neigh-bours are compared in the following table.   Relative strengths are expressed for convenience by numbers representing rifle and sabre fighting strengths as the size of the formations vary, and, therefore, a comparison by formations is apt to be misleading. v It should be noted that whereas the fighting strength figure of the Soviet Red Army is 396,000, the feeding strength of military personnel in the Army is about 1,000,000 : Neighbouring&apos; States.		Fronts.		Soviet Army.		Rifles and sabres.			Present grouping on respective fronts.	Available reserve.Finland........ Esthonia Lithuania       ......

From the above table it appears that so long as the Red Army remains loyal the Russians, profiting from natural jealousies and the war weariness of her neighbours, have sufficient military resources to attack at least any one of their hostile neighbours between the Baltic and the Caspian Sea with a reasonable prospect of success.11. As regards Trans-Caucasia, there are great natural obstacles to be overcome in military operations, and these are even more important military factors than the actual&apos; number of troops which might be available.   Generally speaking, it is doubtful whether the Soviet Government could enforce its will on Afghanistan by military operations in the face of real national resistance on the part of the Afghans.   It should, however, be(8975)
quite practicable for it to employ sufficient forces to occupy and control the whole of Northern Persia, in view of tht fact that the Persian Government has practically no armed force at its disposal. Th j probability of the Bolsheviks occupying and controlling Northern Persia has been strengthened by the announcement of our early evacuation of the country. The Persian Government is already treating with the Bolshevik Government on lines proposed by the latter. This is merely the first step towards the over-running of Northern Persia by the Bolsheviks.12. It would appear that the Soviet Government can only maintain itself in power by force of its army. The Bed Army, by reason of its nature, must be kept in full emplo3unent. otherwise it will re-act on the Government. Hence we may expect to see that army in perpetual activity until the ambitions of Russia are satiated. In this connection a most important point to he considered with reference to the Russian Army is the want of clothing and boots. This disability just now will do more to render the forces innocuous in the coming spring than any shortage of arms and ammunition. Every endeavour should consequently be made to prevent stocks purchased by Russia from reaching their destination.B. Turkey and Trans-Caucasia.13. The Nationalist Army in Turkey may be divided into two portions :(1.) The Eastern Army under Kiazim Kara Bekir. (2.) The Western Army under Mustafa Kemal.Mustafa Kemal is nominally Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Armies, but he is believed to have little power over Kiazim Kara Bekir, who appears to represent the faction which is in closest alliance with the Russian Bolsheviks. There is little chance now of any serious rising on the part of the Armenians, and the retention of Kiazim-Kara-Bekir&apos;s Army in in the Alexandropol area is probably to check Bolshevik armed penetration into Eastern Anatolia.14. In the Western Army under Mustafa Kemal there are availableto meet the Greeks or to threaten Lieut.-General Harington/s command on the Ismid front three Turkish Army Corps or about 28,000 combatants, which might be reinforced from the corps in the Sivas-Samsun and the corps in the Diarbekir area. The state of the communications and the necessity for keeping troops in these latter areas limit the numbers available for reinforcements, and it is believed that the maximum force which could be employed by the Nationalists in the west can for the present be put at 30,000 regulars and 10,000 irregulars.15. Turkey also has forces operating against the French in Cilicia and concentrating against the British in the neighbourhood of Jezireh on the Tigris. The function of these forces is probably rather to keep alive the Arab hostility to France and Great Britain for the present, than to undertake any direct operations on their own account, but they will inevitably seize any opportunity which may be offered to profit by the situation. In view of a possible agreement in the near future between the French and the Nationalist Government, it is probable that the 4,000 rifles reported by Constantinople to be on this front may be made available for the western front.IV. Present Situation of the Allies at Constantinople and in turkey in Asia.16. The Allied troops in the neighbourhood of Constantinople amount at present to 15 battalions, of which 6 are British, 8 French and 1 Italian, plus 1 British cavalry regiment. The Entente is therefore dependent on the Greek Army in Asia Minor, which amounts to 8 divisions, or 80,000 rifles and sabres, and is holding a line from the Black Sea, north of Ismid, to the southern end of the Smyrna enclave. Latest reports from General Headquarters, Constantinople, state that the Greek Army appears to have recovered from the political crisis caused by the fall of Yenizelos, though some falling off in the higher leading is to be anticipated. The fighting efficiency of its units may be considered unimpared, but it is still impossible to say what will be the final outcome of events in Greece, and we must still reckon with the possibility, and indeed probability, that the Greek Government will be unable to maintain the army in anything approaching its present strength. There may also at any time arise a fresh crisis which will affect the efficiency of the Greek Army.In Constantinople and the Straits the situation during the past two months has given increasing cause for anxiety.   The Russian refugees from Wrangefs Army, over
whom the British have no control, and who have not been completely disarmed, have become restless through inactivity and want, and are proving a fair field for Bolshevik propaganda, which is very active. These military refugees amount to 69,000, and it is probable that about 15,000 of them still possess arms. It is known that a number of the senior officers of the Don and Kuban Cossacks are intriguing with Bolshevik agents, and as the men are loyal to their officers, the danger of a cowp de main against Constantinople itself cannot be ignored. This possibility is increased by the new French policy of handing over the feeding, &amp;c, of all Russian refugees to a Russian Committee in Paris.Added to this danger, Constantinople contains large numbers of disappointed Turkish ex-officers and officials, who are approaching destitution, and a number of fugitive Venezelist officers and adherents, who are bent on making trouble. *The latest appreciation of the Turkish situation by Lieut.-General Sir C. H. Harington, Commander-in-Chief, Army of the Black Sea, is attached as Appendix A.V. Future Contingencies.17. As regards the Baltic States it has been shown that Russia must eventually absorb these completely or reduce them to the position of provinces of Russia. No vital interests of the British Empire appear to be threatened by such action and it does not appear to be an issue which the Empire should pledge a single company of soldiers to influence.18. As lor Poland, in contrast to the situation in the Baltic States, the British Empire cannot stand aside without making an effort to maintain its independence which is a vital condition of the Treaty of Versailles. It appears certain that the Soviet Republic will sooner or later attack Poland, and the Allies will be called upon for assistance. The present resources of the British Army are not sufficient to add its quota to Allied armed assistance even if the people of Great Britain would tolerate it. Further, in the opinion of the General Staff the procedure should be confined to influencing the situation by endeavouring to remove the causes which are most likely to induce Russia to attack. The steps recommended -to this end are the following : (a.) Assist Poland to make herself strong by giving her permission to buy such stores and material in Allied countries, or even Germany, as she can pay for.(6.) Use every means to prevent Poland from adopting an aggressive and consequently foolish policy.(c.) Discourage Polish assistance to the White Russian and Ukrainian movements if they become important again.(d.) Prevent or impede the re-equipment of the Bolshevik armies.19. In the Caucasus the Russian Bolshevik Government, if it decided to pursue such a scheme and to diminish its commitments in other directions, is in a position (vide Part 2) to re-establish its previous frontier. Though communication by sea with Trebizond could be prevented by the Entente navies, and land communica-tions west of the Nakhichevan-Kars railway are poor in the winter, there appears to be no reason to think that the Bolsheviks could not establish themselves even at Erzeroum or on a line west of Erzingan through the Giaour Dagh to the Black Sea, which they reached in 1917, unless the Turks can be persuaded to oppose them with united forces.It will be remembered that before the Russian debacle in 1917 the Russians had established and maintained an army of about 250,000 men on this front and though they might not at present spare this number, there is no reason why, given time, the Soviet Government should not reproduce the same result as was accomplished in the Czarist regime. Once established on the above line the Bolsheviks would be in a position to choose their own line of advance either westward in support of the Turkish Unionist and Nationalist forces or southwards into Mesopotamia and Persia, by the routes leading from Erzeroum to Van and Mosul.In his report, dated the 7th January, Colonel Stokes from Tiflis reports that a large number of troops had left Trans-Caucasia for Russia by train, after plundering Baku, and, on 31st December, Moscow had announced that the Army would be reduced to one-half the present strength by the middle of 1921; on the other hand, Mesopotamia report that Baku has been heard conversing with 12 new unlocated wireless telegraph stations.   It is not improbable that the Bolsheviks are circulating the reports referred
to by Colonel Stokes in order to mislead. Too much weight must not, therefore, be attached to Colonel Stokes&apos; reports on this subject, and it seems not unlikely that the Russians are preparing an offensive for the spring of this year with Trans-Caucasia as its jumping off ground and Persia as its first objective, to be followed, perhaps, by an advance into Mesopotamia if conditions are favourable. The easiest line of advance for such an undertaking would appear to be via Enzeli and Hamadan.20. As regards Mesopotamia and Persia, it is outside the scope ofthis paper to discuss in detail this situation, but there is ample evidence to show that the Bolsheviks are pursuing relentlessly their aim of striking at British power in both these countries. This they will continue to do by turning to account the instrument for propaganda placed in their hands by the terms of the present Turkish Treaty. Thus they may increase the likelihood of a recrudescence of the Mesopotamian troubles of this summer, which would force us to despatch large reinforcements if our position is to be maintained.iVI. Conclusion.21. An endeavour has been made to show that in Europe the situation is not such as will necessarily involve British military commitments, but the disappearance of Wrangel, the capitulation of Armenia, the imminent threat to Georgia and the downfall of Venizelos confront us with a situation in the Middle East with which it may be beyond our power to cope without a change of policy.22. In the opinion of the General Staff recent events have shown clearly that whatever may be the outcome of the present crisis in Greece, it is unsafe to rely upon the Greek Army to cover the Allied position in Turkey. The temporary success of the recent operation by the Greek Army in Asia Minor, which consisted of a reconnaissance in force by one Army Corps of two divisions to the line of the Anatolian railway between Eskishehr and Bilejik, followed by a withdrawal to its former line, must not be allowed to influence our distrust in its ability to cover this position. It would appear that Mustapha Kemal had granted a suspension of hostilities in this area, and it may be that the Greek thrust caught his army at a time when, owing to its want of discipline, it was somewhat disintegrated. On the other hand, should the suspicions of General Headquarters, Constantinople, be correct, that Mustafa Kemal and the Greeks are in collusion, the value of the Greek successes is even less.The General Staff are, therefore, of opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Government, must be prepared either to (a.) Send reinforcements to Constantinople. (6.) Withdraw the existing British troops, or (c.) Re -adjust the Allied policy.The first alternative, owing to the present state of the British military resources is out of the question as a permanent measure. As regards the second, however desirable from a military point of view, a question of high policy is involved, and in any case a temporary reinforcement to effect withdrawal might be necessary. The General Staff, however, believe that a drastic revision of the territorial terms of the Turkish Treaty in respect of Smyrna, the province of Kars, and possibly of Thrace, would induce the Turkish Nationalists to break with the Russian Soviet Government. &apos; In short, the change in the Government of Greece, though it alters the situation of the British and Allied troops temporarily for the worse at Constantinople, gives the opportunity to make gracious concessions to the Turks, and so wean them from their alliance with the Russian Bolsheviks, by this means recreating Turkey as a buffer State between the Entente Powers and Russia, and removing some of the principal underlying causes of unrest throughout the British dominions in Egypt, Mesopotamia and India.
APPENDIX A.APPRECIATION OP THE TURKISH SITUATION BY LISUT.-GENERAL SIR C. H. HARINGTON, COMMANDER-IN-0IIIEP, ARMY OP THE BLACK SEA, CONSTANTINOPLE, 14th JANUARY, 1921.Political Situation.1. The Nationalist Government stands for tho Turks. The present regime at Constantinople is a detached improvisation.2. It is impossible for the Nationalist Government to exist independently for very long by itself. To ensure its continued existence it must either ;-(a.) Exchange its former bondage to Germany for an even more exacting bondage to the Soviet.(b,) Adopt the temporary expedient of compounding with Constantine, which would presumably implySoviet sufferance, (c.) Accept the terms of the Entente.3. As regards the above courses: (a.) As always, Russia is still the nightmare of Turkey.(b.) To compound with the Greeks would be a counsel of despair, probably involving the cession to Greece of Constantinople in exchange for concessions regarding the fait accompli in Anatolia.(c.) If the Entente terms were considered by the Turks to be compatible with their future Nationalist existence, the natural course would be to accept them, through the agency of Italy. To modify these terms, the Nationalists are wrongly playing a game of bluff with the Constantinople Government and with the Entente, instead of throwing themselves on the mercy of Great Britain, who for them stands for the constructive power iu the Entente. The great factors in this game of bluff are :  v(i.) Anti-British propaganda, which certainly plays into the hands of the Bolsheviks, (ii.) Hopes of the eventual disintegration of the Greek Army.(iii.) Por the present, Bulgaria seems to be out of action, and America merely holds awatching brief, as far as can be seen here, (iv.) The final eventual issue is between the British Empire and Russia.Strategic Situation.4. Though it is as yet too soon to state categorically what the future line of Russian advance will be, bearing in mind present state of Soviet agreement with Persia, Constantinople is threatened by Russian envelopment through the Caucasus and Bessarabia.5. Turkey cannot offer effective opposition to the Greeks at the present time, or to the Russians in future.6. The Nationalists can create military embarrassment for Great Britain and Prance in Upper Mesopotamia and Cilicia, though this will only react against themselves, vis-d-vis, Russia.7. Roumania,&quot; Bulgaria and Greece can eventually be disposed of by Russia in detail, failing some important diversion.Tacitcal Situation.- 8. Local situation at Constantinople is delicate, though from latest information serious efforts are being made by the French to cope with the Russian refugee problem. Local Turks are being tested to the limit of endurance, and the British position here would become intolerable in the event of a Greek collapse or substantial co-operation between the Nationalists and Russians.
