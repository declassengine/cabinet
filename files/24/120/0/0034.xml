THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PHOP2HTY Or HIS BHIT^NIC IUJ3STY*3 GOVBBi^BWT),G R E T.Copy NoCABINET,WmX SURVEY Of THE STATE OP PGR V03IBMEED E1ST FEBRUARY, 1981.(Olroulated by the Chief Secretary fpir.Irel.ana).I submit for the consideration cf the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 21st instant,GENERAL STATS OF THE COUNTEY.Statistics of Outrages,Although the total number of outragos reported for the weok is slightly in exooss of that for the previous weok, the number of armed attacks upon the forces of the Crown fell from 26 to 16, and the casualties to the Grown forces (2 killed.and 9 wounded) are the lowest recorded for any week of the present yoar.   The sixteen armed attaa&amp;s consisted of ten ambushes, four attacks on occupied police barraoks, one assassination and one case of attemptod assassination^    The assassination was that of a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who was murdored on the 14th instant while returning alo?ie to Nenagh,06. Tipporary after paying a hurried visit of a few hours to his mother at Ballywillian, seven miles sway.   Thisconstable was a witness in an important murdor trial whiohis now pending and the removal of his evidence was no doubt the motive frtr his assassination.   The other fatal casualtywas that of a Constable who was mortally wounded in anambush at Ballough, Balbriggan District, Co. Dublin on the
13th instant.The ambushes during the week included three attacks on trains, the most serious being that at Upton Station, Co. Cork on the 15th instant, which resulted in the death of six oivilian passengers one of whom was a woman, and the wounding of six soldiers ana five civilians.   The ambushers lost two of their number killed,and several are known to have been wounded.   Two other train attacks, one near Askeaton, Adare District, Co. Limerick on the 17th instant, and the other at Lisselton, Co. Kerry on the 18th instant, were frustrated without mishap to the Crown forces, but one oivilian passenger fa girl) was wounded, on the former occasion.   The other ambushes during the week were half hearted affairs and resulted in no casualties to the Crown forcese   In one case which took place near Mourne Abbey, Mallow Listrict, the rebels themselves suffered heavily losing four of their number killed and eight prisoners0 An even more disastrous encounter from the rebel point of view took place on the 20th instant at Lisgoo&amp;d Midleton District, Co. Cork-   A party of the Hampshire BQgiment surprised a body of armed civilians in a house and at onoe prooeeaed to engage them.   With the assistant of a body of police under the commend of the County Inspector who quickly arrived on the scene they surrounded the house and after an engagement lasting over an hour succeeded in setting it on fire.   Thirteen rebels were killed and the survivors eight in number, three of whom were wounded were compelled,to surrender.   Among those killed was the Comma^ant of theliiMidleton Company of the Irish Republican Army.   Eighteen rifles and other firearms of various kinds, together with a large quantity of bombs and ammunition and a motor oar were oaptured.    :.&apos;he only casualty on the Cro?m side was
one 3oldier wounded.   This incident is by far the most serious reverse the rebels have yet sustained and is likely to have a very chastening effect on their morale.   The occupied barracks attacked were those at Gowran and Callan, Co-iKilkenny, Ballyporeen, CcTipperary, and Oharleville, CcOorko   The attack in each case was beaten off without loss to the garrison*Seven Sinn Fein murders of persons suspecte &apos; of having given information to the Police or Military Authorities were reported during the week.   In one case the murdered man, who had previously been wounded, was dragged out of the South Infirmary, Cork on a stretcher while unconcious and shot dead.Minor outrages for the week included 47 raids on mails and 5 raids for arms.   The number of raids on malls was considerably higher than in recent weeks,Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 71 for the week,Trials of Civilians by Court Hartial,Fifty-three trials of civilians by Court Martial tookplace during the week and resulted in thirty-four convictionsand nine acquittals.   The following is an analysis of the sentences imposed in the convicted cases:2 sentences of penal servitude (3 years and 10 years)14      &quot; &quot;   imprisonment withhard labour (2 months to 2 years)8      &quot; &quot;   imprisonment withouthard labour (2 months to 2 years)1 Fine of  50 with the option of 4 months imprisonment1   &quot;     &quot;    LO,   &quot;     &quot;        &quot;     &quot;   3      &quot; &quot;3 Fines of  .10 and forfeiture of ammunition,1 Fine of  10    &quot; &quot; motor cycleQ1 Fine of  5, Total    3T&quot;
In one of the renaining cases the accused was bound over in his own recognizances of  50. to keep the peace, and in the other two the sentences were remitted by the Confirming Officer.   Except in one case all the convictions were for offences connected with the presant disturbed state of the country, the majority of the charges being based on tho possession of arms and ammunition or of seditious literature, Internment OrdersLNinety-three orders for internment were made during the week, bringing the total number of persons now interned to 1,784.STATE CF  THE POJMS FCRCES.The week&apos;s recruiting for the Royal Irish Constabulary shows considerably better figures than for the previous week. The number of resignations has been exceptionally heavy, but I am informed that the majority of the men who have resigned are recent recruits who have expressed a desire to be allowed to return to ordinary civilian occupations.The usual particulars of wastage and recruitment for the week are as follows:t-4-

ESCAPE OF PRISONERS.

I regret to state that one of the prisoners convicted of having taken part in the atrocious murders of British Officers on Sunday the 21st.November succeeded in effecting his escape from Kilmainham Prison on the night of the 14th.instant, together with two other prisoners who were awaiting trial on serious charges.  A military enquiry is being held into the circumstances of the escape which appears to suggest complicity on the part of the several members of the military guard of the Prison.  An enquiry is also being held into the escape of another important prisoner from Derry Prison (a civil prison) on the following day.

CAPTURE OF IMPORTANT SINN FEIN DOCUMENTS.

An event of the week to which I attach great importance was the discovery of one of the secret headquarters of the Sinn Fein organisation in Dublin, which resulted in the capture of a number cf documents which reveal an intention on the part of the more desperate and extreme leaders of the rebol conspiracy to carry their campaign of incendiarism and anarchy into some of the largest industrial centres of Great Britain where they are believed to have a considerable following of active sympathisers among the Irish element of the population. It is to be hoped that this criminal design has been frustrated as the result of its public disclosure in the course of the recent debate in Par1iament.
