(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP EIS BRITAOTO MAJESTY1^ GOTOUMJT).OABIIB1, T.SECRET. &quot;Memo random fry tho First CoK&amp;ifi innqy j3jM ojjto*On the 15 th of January, 19SO&amp; application       made toSir Lionol Sarle by Lt. General Oo&amp;ringuon, acting on behalf-the Guards1 Memorial Oonaalttee, for assistance In finding a site la the Weat end of London, for a proposed memorial to the Guards Division.    Several sites were considered, hut were for one reason or another found to be unsuitable for a memorial on the scale contemplated, and, ultimately it was suggested that tho site in St. $amQsls Park, opposite the Horse guards parade, on which it wag intended to place, a statue to Lord Kitchener, should be granted to the Guards0    Tho Kitchener Memorial Committee agreed to forego the site in favour of the Gruarda, hut before giving my consent I referred the proposal toa Committee composed of Sir Lionel BarXe, 2ir George Framptcn,-R*A*, Sir Reginald Blo&amp;field, EcA. , Mr. R0J* Allison, the Chief Architect of my Department, and myself,    Uhis Committee X appointed some time ago to advise me cn questions connected, with sites for statues and also on matters of designs of memorials, eta., to whioh my approval is required and their advice was that the site in question could well be allotted to the Guards, Is at that in view of the fact that the memorial wa3 likely to be an important one they agreed with my Architects, that it should form part of a larger scheme of alteration of the roadways in this part of St, Jameses park which has always been considered to be desirable.On 2nd. August last, I informed the House of Commons in answer to a question put to me, that the site, opposite the Horse Guards Parade had been granted to the Guards for a memorial..,P
memorialj and that I would have drawings showing the proposed alterations placed in the-Tea * Room at the Eov.se for members to see, to enable them to.have an opportunity of expressing their Viewso   9?ke whole&apos;poheme would, involve considerable alteration to the ?ark5 but would not result in any diminution of the area inside tho railing and would in  act, increase it, and I would also proposo to have grass plots laid in front of the India Office&apos;, Foreign Office, etc, similar to those in front of the Office of Works,   A, number of trees would also have to bo removedp but those are mostly very poor unthrifty spool-mens whioh are never likely to do well9 and they would be ultimately replaced by more than an equal number lining the new roadway.   I had not contemplated the possibility of apply-ing to Parliament for funds for the carrying out of this larger scheme in the immediate future, and the Guarda Committee state that thoy are unaule to mako any contribution, having been able to raise barely sufficient for the memorial alonet (about &amp;2O.000);; but I conceive that it may be possible to undertake suoh a work as a scheme for the relief of unemplcy-menta   I am again being&apos; questioned in the House of Commons as to tho nature of the alterations contemplated5 and in view of the pledge which has been given that the House should be consulted before any alterations aro undertaken in tho parks; and also in view of the fact that Considerable controversy may possibly arise, X feel that I ought to acquaint my colleagues of the proposals which would, I thinkP result in a great im-- 1prcvement to the Park,, and I hope that they will be able to. ...      ,..      , . i&apos;.give their support to the scheme,- I may mention that the King is strongly in favour of placing the G-uards Memorial on the site in question,(Sgd.)   liJHED MCND.Office of V/orka,   &apos;S,W,.  8th9 February, 1921.
