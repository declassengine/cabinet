SECRET.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Sec return of Stoic for India, datedIlk March 11)21.Weekly Report.   Suction I.   Punjab,.....Occurrence at Nankana Sahib lias over-sliatlowecl everything else. Sikhs are bound lo be inllanied to a dangerous extent by murder of co-religionists, but it is hoped sympathetic attitude taken by Government will have a steadying effect. In some qu trters attempts made to throw responsibility on Government officials, But Punjab Government lias issued a disclaimer and stated their determination to do their utmost to bring criminals to justice. Fanaticism of Sikhs also indicated by continued seizure of shrines by A akali Dal party, in (? which) undesirable elements have enlisted.

Delhi. Some Sikhs endeavoured unsuccessfully to proclaim Hartal on receiving the news of Nankana Sahib affair. Their failure has somewhat embittered their relations with Mohamedan agitators, who again are unpopular with a section of Hindus for advising Delhi confectioner member to take and retain his seat iu Legislative Assembly. Real basis for general ill-feeling appears to be the increasing difficulty of raising funds for agitation. Rival patriots accuse each other of corruption.Section i. Judgment pronounced in Delhi burial case on 1st March. Abdul la and one other accused sentenced to three months&apos; simple imprisonment and to furnish security. Other two accused acquitted. Half-hearted Hartal organised in afternoon on news of conviction being spread and. indignation meeting held at Gliaziabad outside Delhi.Bengal.---Attendance at schools and colleges satisfactory; magisterial enquiry into Kalighat riot not yet completed.

Mass meeting on 27th largely attended by persons from all over the province, and resolutions in favour of complete Home Rule carried with enthusiasm. Probably viewed with disfavour by Burman deputation and more responsible leaders of young Burman movement. Non-co-operation openly threatened at this meeting. Supporters of Home Rule movement involving-separation from India and (? Indians) absent from the meeting. (? Indians;, however, continuing their activities, and judgment of the Chief Court upholding under section 153 (A) Indian Penal Code, the conviction of editor and printer of Rangoon Mail was made occasion for much noisy agitation.Section (3.

Leaders promised to use their inlluence, hut would give no guarantee. Deputy Commissioner issued orders under section 11-1 prohibiting&apos; persons entering civil lines from city except for good reasons, because he feared possibility of another demonstration at District Court during hearing of case in which Dr. Paranjpye is showing case against order prohibiting picketing liquor shops.

Governor sent message to Council regarding Nagpur disturbances, in which he repudiates false statements regarding Government policy) and states Government will use all lawful and reasonable means for enforcement authority by taking action within law against offenders, and invites support from all responsible persons against movement, directed towards subversion of authority Government.Section 7. North-West Frontier Province. At meeting held at Baunu on 20th by Local Congress Committee, very objectionable anti-Government speeches made, and.non-payment of income tax advocated. Khalifat Committee is widening area of meetings. One held in Bakka Khel limits and more proposed among other Waziris. They are also now openly anti-Government and objectionable. Deputy Commissioner proposes to giv-3 Khalifat Committee written notice forbidding holding of meetings anywhere in the district without his previous sanction.

General. Separate telegram sent on school situation by Educational Department shows how movement has worn itself out. Gandhi in recent tour in United Provinces has emphasised following conditions as essential to early attainment of Swaraj, namely :-(1) Unity between Hindus and Mohamedans; (2) Adoption of non-violent methods ; and (3) The spinning wheel.lie has held aloof from wilder elements and conspicuously avoided the Kisan Sabhas. We have been threatened with two serious strikes, one in the Telegraph Department, and the second in the railways. We made preparations, but first is now delinitely off, and the second has been postponed pending discussion.Though we consider it necessary to report all incidents of which, information is received, too much importance should, not be attached to isolated events. In our opinion, improvement noted in last week&apos;s telegram generally maintained, but Sikh movement is causing anxiety as before.
