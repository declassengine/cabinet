KRITAT^lO jjAJ CT1 3 GOTOMT-NT),GQvi&amp;MOT OF I&quot;RTL.A3TD ACT. *   -MejiK ra^vVarn by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I circulate herewith a Memorandum on the pro:ress&apos;of the arrangements made for bringing the Government of Ireland Act into operation and on certain points requiring early decision by the cabinet *1. in pursuance of the directions gi-ven by the Cabinet onthe 14th January last, the preliminary work for bringing the Government of Ireland Act int* operation has been commenced.I have caused circulars to be issued to all the public departments concerned, drawing attention to the administrative changes effected by the Act, the financial adjustments, arrange--ments for the transfer of officers, and the adaptation of statutes that require to &quot;be made in preparation for the transfer of services to the new Governments-.   Pach department has been requested to examine its position in the li^ht of these changes, and to report -to the Under secretary the alterations ana adaptations that appear to then to be necessary-   These reports will provide the material upon which will be framed Oruers in Council giving statutory effect to the preliminary arrangements and the adaptations required.The-work has already been taken in hand by the several departments, and there is no reason to aoubt that it will be completed without any serious difficulty in sufficient time to admit of the transfer of Irish services to the new Governments within the period allowed for this purpose by the Act, viz., prior to the 2nd Karen 1922,   It i:ust, of course, he borne in
mind that the date of the -e transfers depends not merely on the completion of transfer arrangements on the part of the United Kingdom Government-, but also upon the. new Governments bein^ ready to take over and to carry on the services -when transferred.Accordingly, it is no1&quot; possible to suggest a provisional time table f^r brin^in^ the Act into operation.   Assuming it to be the intention of the Government that elections for the new parliaments shall be held at the earliest possible date, then the first and most important work, to be completed is the adaptation of the existing eleotion laws (including the application of pcB,) to the elections to the Houses of Commons and the formulation of schemes for the eleotion of senators. This wordc is bein-i; undertaken by the Irish Local Government Board and the Clerk of the Crown and Kanaper,   who are the existing authorities mainly concerned with parliamentary elections under the present system.   A conference of returning offioers (under sheriffs) has been held by the Local Govern-ment Board, and they have been instructed in the methods to be followed in counting the votes, etc-, for p      elections., The Board has already undertaken a similar-duty in connecti on .with Irish local elections to which this system, applies.Proclamations summoning the new parliaments and writs of eleotion and other formal documents are also in preparation. From the progress that has been made in this direction, it may be stated, with some degree of confidence, that the preliminary ies will be co/npleted by the end of March, and, accordingly,  &apos; any subsequent date oould be fixed as the first appointed day. The same day, mi^ht be fixed as the day upon which most of the provisions of, the Act are to come into operation, inducing
provisions as to the netting up of ministerial departments and appointment of ministers, the establishment of a Joint - Exchequer loarel and Civil service CO-^ittce.   There are,--however,,certain important provisions which must remain sus-pended until a later date, viz.,.the new financial provisions, the transfer of services, and provisions for the abolition of the present supreme Court and, the establishment of the new Courts.   Time must be allowed for the new Governments to get into harness and survey the ground before undertaking the responsibility, consequent upon change from the old financial, administrative, and judicial system   to the new. 3. A very important question arises as regards the firstelection, viz., are the elections to be held and the parliaments to-be established simultaneously in Northern &apos;and Southern irelan-..   This question has already been before the Cabinet and is aealt with in a Cabinet.Memorandum (Appendix to C.P.2444, p^irs. (l) and (3)),   It has nor been raised by Sir Henry Robinson, the vice President of the Irish  ,ooal Government Board, as a result of the information which he h^s obtained from the returning officers.   He sug,,ests that much would   be gained if the Northern elections v/ere helc in advance cf those of the South.   The prooedure suggested is that on the , first appointed day a proclamation \-ould be issued siononing the Northern parliainent, that the 1fortrern Parliament would meet on the day named in the proclamation (say, six weeks ,  from the date of the proclamation) and would be opened formally about a fortnight after the first meet in,;.   The seiof: course would be followed in the case of the Southern parliament, after an interval of thret. months from the Northern proclamation,   sir Henry Robinson,, the Vice President of the T,ocal Government Boaranticipates thatM      3      &quot;*
r     251by that time conditions in the wouth will be more favourable than they are likely to do in spring or early juimner.   Ho effective legislative or administrative action could be taken in the iiorth until the -outhern Parliament and Government had been established, but during the interval ministerial depart-ments &quot;would be set up in the north and a Cabinet forced, and the Northern ministers would be fully e-aplojeA in .;,:.e paring for the ests.bli Plains nt of a \,orkng administration and. in formulating a pro^ranno of legislation..uhe groat auvant^cs claimed for this course are that the actual establishment of the Parliament&apos; and Government on in the Ilorth will be inclispu^abla proof- that the Government of Ireland Act is a reality and tho independence of Northern Ireland an accomplished fact, and that it would demonstrate, as nothing else would, to the whole &apos;. oild, and to uouthern Ireland In particular, the inlineSmand importance Ox the powers that have been&apos; dole gated by the **ot&apos;.-  It would not a--pear to be necessary thai, the Order fixing the first a] pointed day should fix different dav:s for Horth and South,   The Bug^etst ion would be carried out by i* ailing a pro-c laoatibn on the common aj pointed day&apos; summoning the Lor them I aril&apos; -nent, and vithholding for three months the istue of a similar proclamation summonin,; the oouthern parliament.   This would not be in strict, accordance with the opening words of the first section of the Aot whioh provides that &quot;On and after ;ihe &quot; ap-pointed clay there shall be established for southern Ixelan\d...a^^larlinmentj etc.,, and there shall be established for Northern Ireland a Parliament, etc.&apos;&quot;;   but it is submitted than; the with-holding of the proclamation in Southern Ireland could not effectively by called in question, and an eiqress discrimination between Ilorth and .jOUth in the Order itself is to be avoided, if pos3ibl9tf
For the purposes of summoning the new Parliaments a new apt ointment to the Office of Lord Lieutenant must be made and a decision of the Cabinet is sought as to the varson to be appointed,   Letteis latent of appointment in the new form and instructions have already teen prepared, a.,4 subject to the settlement of one or two technical points th9.se are now ready.It seems desirable that oonmiunioations should be opened at: soon as pos,-. ible with some o. the person^ designated, to fill the offices of idnisters of Northern Ireland, in . connection vith several matter &amp; which will require immediate -consideration and preliminary action on their part; for instance, the arauguration of a system of Government finance in -Northern Irolandt which under the iict must be a counterpart jf the financiel system 01 the United Kingdom Government $ This will involve the establishment of a Consolidated Pund and Exchequer and the ap; ointment of a Comptroller and Auditor General.   The Ministers designated v ill also require expert assistance to enable them to arrange the details of Parlia-rflentary procedure on and after the fix-at meeting of the  arlL-Ament and to formulate standing ciders.   It is suggested  hat the Speaker might be approached vith a view to his- plan in. /at their diapOL:al ne services of one 01 more of his officers for these purposes^.Cabinet authority is sought for the taking of these steps. .   Dhe appointment in Ihe nev; form to the Office of Lord Chancellor should te made ^imrjJLtaaeouily ^ ith the abolition of the existing juprevie Court and the establishment of the new uupie-;ie Courts, a change whioa oannot be effected for some considerable time,  but before that date it 7/ill be necec,,ary to a; point a Lord Chief Justice of Northern&apos; Ireland seeing thatthe
the approval of such Lord Chief Justice is required for the transfer of existing judges to the Northern oupreuie Court, ihe Act directs that such Lord Chief Justice shall tie appoint-ed at least one month before the abolition of the existing Court,, and as the transfer arrangements will occupy several months and \ ill demand close attention on the part of the Lead of the Northern Judiciary, it would seem that this post should be filled at an earlj/ date   A Cabinet decision is necessary a6 to the person to be ^pointed and the time of his appointment o &apos;(Intd.)
