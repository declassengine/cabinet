(1).           29 th January, 1919.My Lord,          I beg  to  submit  the  following report on the work ofthe Pood Production Department for the week ended 28th January,1D19:                  The  Weather  and Condition of Crops.          Compared with the  extremely wet weather of the previousperiod there was some  improvement during the past week.   Insome districts ploughing was possible on suitable land and frostfacilitated the carting of  roots ond of manure.                     LOCAL  ORGADilSATIOlv DIVISION .               Work  of Agricultural Executive, Committees.Prosecutions.   A  farmer at Weston Turville in Buckinghamshire,who had been served  with two cultivation orders by the Committeeand who h^d msde no  attempt to carry them out, has been fined  5(yond  10. 10. 0. on each summons for his non-compllence with thenotices.Determination  of Tenancies,  During the week 4 Orders have beenmade, b^ the Board  determining tenancies on account of bad f^rm-Ing in respect of  605  seres.Allotments.    Since  April 30th lost 452 local authorities hoveagreed to acoaiire  under the Cultivation of Lands order 5,147  acres(64,446 allotments),   During the: week, in addition  to the landmentionrd above,  17  loc^l authorities have undertaken to  acquire-further areas  amounting altogether to 231 acres, which willfurnish 2,504  allotments.
I                   Land Drainage.          The necessary preliminaries to the formation ofDrainage Boards for certain districts In Nottinghamshire dr&amp;jby main watercourses are well advanced.   An engineer, instilby the Nottinghamshire Commissioners of Sewers/has Inspectedthe Devon, Carr Dyke, Smite&apos;, Fairholm Brook, etc. and hascorroborated the report of the Board&apos;s Chief Engineer, as tocondition of the streams&quot;; end the necessity for cleansing ondgrading-   He agrees also as to the desirability of the work being done by the Commissioners instead of by a new authoritycreated by the Board of Agriculture The Commissioners have adt;his report and have decided to put. his recommendations into etat once.   The existing Devon and Smite districts are to been larged to include tributary streams, and as,, this system hasoutfall the whole Is to be amalgamated and made one drainagedistrict.   The Fairholm Brook area will constitute a separatidrainage district.   The total area which will derive directbenefit from the cleansing of these streams Is estimated at 7acres, and the approximate cost of the works decided upon will]amount to  8,150*                   HORTICULTURAL DIVISION,Fruit Section.  Ten acres of land for n demonstration fruit pljhave bern selected at  the Holbeach Crown  Colony, and arrangemejprior to planting *re  nearing completion,.Marketing of Surplus Produce.   Satisfactory arrangements have!teen made to settle difficulties, which have, arisen between  the)Eseex County Marketing Society and the Wlckford Small Holdings!Co-operative Society,          At Coggeshall a public meeting has  been held,, as  aresult  of which a Village Committee  has  been  formed  and  sharestaken in  the County&apos; Society.
Instruction and. Advice.  Conferences have been attended at Ayle8hamand Harbston (Norfolk), in Kesteven, and at Grantham (Lincoln), whenthe questions of soil working,  intensive cultivation and successionalcropping were fully discussed.    Demonstrations on the pruning of fruit trees have also been given at these places,                         TECHNICAL DIVISION.Reduction of Sheep in the South and West of England.    A reporthss been submitted to the Board on an enquiry made by the technical committee into the extent and causes of the reduction of sheep inthe western and south-western counties.   The area said to bechiefly affected and covered by the.enquiry, comprises Hampshire,Oxfordshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire,Somerset, Devon and Cornwalli   In these counties the net reductionin sheep in the year ending June 4th, 1918, as shown by the LiveStock Returns, was 160,000.   The reduction has taken place almostentirely in sheep on arable land, and seems to be most serious InHampshire, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire.          In some arable districts the change is not due to circumstances arising out of the war, but has been going on for someyears, the chief reason being scarcity of labour, accentuated by thedisinclination on the part of younger men oh the farms to take upshepherd&apos;s work.  This has led many farmers to, change from hurdle  sheepto grass sheep, which require less attention and labour, and theCommittee consider it to be the main reason for fearing a continuedreduction in sheep stocks.  Other causes to which the reduction in sheepis attributed are -  (1) the ploughing up of grassland;   (2) scarcity.of concentrated foodj   J3) high prices obtainable for ewes;  (4) the  PoodControllers action  in fixing the same price for all  classes of mutton and  lamb,   (5) high  cost of hay;  (6) the poor root crop of 1918.
         The removal of some of these &quot;temporary&quot; oauae-g will njdoubt tend to arrest the general reduction of sheep, but unlesssomething can be done iu.,regard to such causes of reduction asscarcity of skilled shepherds,--and-the alleged tendency to  curtaithe root area, it is probable that any future increase will be mainly in grass rather than in hurdle sheep.  Suggesliens  madecorrespondents for dealing with this problem include;-  The altstion of the meat control by the adoption of a differential scale of prices according tc the class of sheep;  (2) Prohibition oftsale for slaughter of ewe lambs for a period of years;  (5) the growing of more forage crops ta replace roots.         .In forwarding the report, the Committee re commended \thalin the event of the prohibition of&apos; sale for slaughter of ewe laij(from hurdle sheep) being decided upon,&quot;it should be restrictedsuch a proportion of ewe lambs as would be sufficient to maintalia permanent ewe flack on the farm.  A furthersuggest!on that  has been made referred to farm agreements;  in Hampshire an almostuniversal clause in such agreements is that a specified number iewes should be kept on the farm, but this clause has1 come  to be generally disregarded.  The Committee thought that it would notbe impracticable to secure a revival of the clause, or at  any  ra!of a modified clause,                       &apos; &apos; * &apos;   -v-  , ,     With regard to the &apos; supply &quot;of labour they suggested thatthe. situation might be relieved to some extent by the draining owomen as shepherdesses,                      *        &quot;   &apos;           &apos;               LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier .,Labour.  The Instructions issued by the War Office lastweek have prevented to some extent the inconvenience that  was  be caused owing to soldiers of Agricultural Companies being 3*ecall&amp;for demobilisation without any notice being given to the employe!
Difficulties are occurring in manning the Board&apos;s horses,  tractors,threshing machines, etc. as there are no &quot;previous employees&quot; toreturn from military service, and Agricultural Executive Committeescannot, therefore, obtain labour until agriculturists are more gener-ally returned to civil life,Demobilisation.  A large number of additional names of pivotal menin agriculture have been sent to the Department of Demobilisationduring the week, bringing the total up to 28,470.&apos;         The Board have been notified that agriculture has been given a higher priority in the demobilisation scheme, agriculturists nowranking for release second to coal miners.  It is to be hoped thatthis action will result in a very large number of agriculturistsreturning home at an early date in order to be available for the heavywork of spring, cultivation that lies ahead,                          Women1s Branch.         Most of the unemployed women In the south of England havenow been absorbed,  There is still unemployment In Derby, Durham, theWest Riding of Yorkshire and Warwickshire.  It has not always beenfound advisable to bring women from the&apos; north of England to the south,because of the varying, conditions under which the work is carried out,although absorption of the unemployed women in the north - where the weather conditions make outside work practically  impossible just now -Is somewhat difficult.         The demand for skilled workers continues. In response toadvertisements inserted in the farming papers.  Many of the vacancies..however, prove to be unsuitable, being already known to the ^omen&apos;sCommittees, and not filled for various reasons.         Arrangements have been made for from fourteen to twenty women?ito be trained in tractor work by the Agricultural Executive Committeein Glamorganshire, these women to work in the county when their periodof training is completed.  This is the result of  the excellentwork done by women working in the county who were sent from the Oxted
Tractor School, and ;vho were the first women to be employed uptractor work in Glamorganshire.Womenrg. Institutes.   A school of Instruction, at *hich 16 stuwere present, was held last week at Oxford.   Several Universilecturers addressed open meetings.   Ten new Institutes have bstarted during the week.                    . &apos;. /                     CULTIVATION DIVISION.Tractor Scheme/   During the week ended 25th January, 4 tractowere sold;  and the number under the control of the ExecutiveCommittees &quot;is now 4,187.   Eight ploughs were consigned and onewithdrawn;  the total number with the Committees  is now 5,329.      ;    During the treek ended 10th January, 2,451 acres were ploughed and 126 acres cultivated,          New bottoms for Cockshutt ploughs are being issued tomany, counties.   &apos; - -   - - - -          The Executive Committee for Worcester&quot;have given notito most of the contractors in the county who were&apos;undertakingmechanical cultivation for them.   Arrangements are being&apos; madeoverhaul all tractor? and implements affected, and to ensure tcontracts in hand will be executed.Horse Scheme.  The sale of surplus horses  continues;  those solduring the past week numbered 607.   Except in one Case,  inCarnarvon, good prices were made.  -&apos;At Newcastle  38 horsesrealised (oh an average) 76 guineas each;   at Nottingham - 56realised 66 &apos; guineas each, and at iixeter 75 realised 55 guineaseach. ,  A number  of in-foal mares&quot;realised  120 each.Steam Tackle.   The acreage dealt with during the past week ^asfollows:-  ploughed 673 acres, cultivated  348 acres.   Total1,021 acres.       &apos;              &apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;  &apos;
                        SUPPLIES DIVISION.Army Manure.   The dump of army manure at Eelmoor near Aldershotis now stated to be reduced to 1,000 tons,  and the service ofbarges which has been worked on the Basingstoke Canal by arrangement with the War Office will cease very shortly.   Thequantity of manure supplied to farmers and allotment holders InSurrey and Hampshire by this service has amounted roughly to15,000 tons,   The price charged&apos;has been 4s.6d. per ton.   Thesupply has been much appreciated, particularly by small holders whowould otherwise have been quite unable to obtain any sufficientquantity of farmyard manure,Official Samples under the Testing of Seeds Order;. .&apos; A largenumber of, official samples of seeds are now being drawn fromseedsmensr warehouses and shops in various parts of the country.These, samples,are tested at the Seed Testing Station, and theattention of  the seedsmen interested is drawn to any markeddiscrepancy between the result of the official test and that onwhich the declaration for sale is based.   For the present it isnot intended  to institute legal proceedings for default under theOrder; as the warnings are having good effect.Seed Oats for Shipment to France.   Arrangements have been madewith the Scottish Board for the supply of about 3,500 tons of seed oats from Scottish merchants.  These will be shipped from east coast ports.  It is hoped that the first cargo in  the north of England may be ready for shipment In the course of the next-ten days.  So far, the germination and bushel weight of thesamples are proving satisfactory.Wart Disease.   A communication has been received from the KentAgricultural  Executive Committee relating to measures proposedby Professor  Salmon of 7/ye  College for the prevention of  the spread of wart disease in Kent,   These measures  consist  inprohibiting the planting of potatoes in ground  which is  infected,and insisting on the land being laid down to grass for  a  period                                -7-
  of at least ten years.   There are obvious objections to this  method of treating infected premises and areas because (a) it  is essential that preventive measures should not involve the  reduction of the acreage under potatoes in England and Wales,  and (b) the period of ten years under grass has been constantly  proved to offer no security against recurrence of wart disease if  the land Is planted with susceptible varieties after that period,            The preventive measures now in force, which Include the  control of the varieties of potatoes to be planted in Infected  areas, and of the movement,of &quot;seed&quot; arid the inspection of growing  crops of immune varieties with a view to the certification of  those which are reasonably free from rogues and suitable for seed  purposes, are directed to check the spread of  the disease and  at  the same time to avoid any material reduction  In the acreage under  potatoes in England and Wales.              &quot;/&apos; 1                 *X              &apos;     71         -   X desire to place on record my obligation and thanks  to the Commissioners and the Officers of the Department for  their  courtesy and consideration to me while I have been Director-  General.   I am glad to feel that, although I  am giving up that  position, I am not.entirely severing my connection with those  with&apos; whom I have been working; and,, as an Adviser to the Board,  I look forward with.pleasure to future intercourse with its  Staff.              ,       ......     I am,                                     My Lord,                                        Your obedient Servant,                                             Director-General,The Rt, Hon.
