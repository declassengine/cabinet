Arrangements are being made through the War AgriculturalExecutive Committees for the selection of suitable -Custodians fovthe Light Draught Army mares that are being transferred by theWar Office to the Board for distribution for breeding purposes.The County Light Horse Breeding Committees and the HuntersImprovement Society have been asked,to take similar action inregard to the mares of Hunter type that will be leased out.          The War Office informed the Bo^rd that it was anticipatedthat there would bo 10,000 Light Draught mares  available for distribution and 2,000 mares of Hunter type.   On present information)it appears more p?obab3e that the total number of marea suitablefor putting out for breeding purposes will be less than 3,000*                     Statistical Division.     Stat1,sjfcieel Branch,  The Live Stock Committee found that muchfewer cattie and sheep had been slaughtered during December thanin November.   The total number of cattle in Great Britain on thecth January is estimated to be some 300,000 :.cre than a year *go,while that of sheep is probably 400,000 grafter.   As tne total of pigs is estimated-at about 335,000 more than in January, 1918, thelive stock position is regarded as Bn.tisfaeto&apos;*y.          The Committeealso reconsidered the forecast made threemonths ago, of the supplies to come forward for slaughter thisseason1.   For the first three months (sinoe October) the resultshava proved very close to the forecast, and the Committee saw noreason to altar th*ir estimates for the nwxt nine months, oxceptas   regards weight of cattle, which, in view of the, improvedoutlook for feeding stuffs, should probably be better thananticipated in November,          A preliminary conference has taken place with members ofthe Scottish and Irish Departments of Agriculture to consider the steps to be taken in respect of. possible claims by farmers underPart I of the Com Production Aot, 1917, especially the- methods                                                           to
to be adopted to check the aoreages claimed for by farmers,    Ascheme was outlined, but requires further consideration,    It isproposed that the work shall be  performed locally by the CropReporters,          Progress may be reported in connection with the settling  Iof the new districts of Crop Reporters;  the chief task performedduring the week being the settlement of the salaries to be attached 1to each district.   This task has been finished, subject tc minor adjustments which may be found necessary after examination locally. IThe Inspectors are interviewing possible Reporters throughout thecountry.     Agricultural Wages Board.   A meeting of the Committee on61 Farming Costs and Cost of Living11 was held on Thursday,  23rdJanuary,          The proof reading of Mr,  rage&apos;a Report on wages andConditions of Agricultural Labourers has been completed and thematerial sent to the Printer for supply.   The Report should appear ;in about two weeks.          One additional whole-time Inspector, Mr. R.K. Park, hasbeen appointed this week.          During the week 109 cases of complaint of non-payment ofthe minimum rates were received, the largest number from * singleoounty being 15 in the case of Worcestershire4,  10 cases were sentto Inspectors for visit;  enquiries by correspondence were made in152 cases;  and 16 cases wsre completed.   Reports were veeeivedfrom Inspectors in 25 oases.          Information has now been laid In ene of the eases in which Iproseoutlon is being undertaken.                                    \            gfflggfl&amp;i flffPyftqla     Survey Branch.                    1           3he Board hjna- received a number of enquiries as tothe basis upon which the redemption money in reapect of corn rentsshould be calculated^   Under Section 10 (3) of the Tithe Act,1918, variable corn rente aro brought within the redemptionprovisions of that Act, except those contained in the first schedule to the Act which la^c down the methods fof theascertainment of the compensation for the redemption of titherentcherge.   Thus in case3 $$re, in default of an agreement between jthe parties as to the amount, the Board determine under Seotion 4 (l)of the recent Act the amount of tho compensation for redemption,the Board are given no instructions by the Act as to how todetermine the amount of the redemption money, except that it shallbe *fair compensation for the redemption&quot;.   The Branch,have submitted for approval the proposal that the method adopted in-arriving at the &quot;gross annual value&quot;, which is tho basis for theredemption cf tithe rentcharge, shall be applied, with thenecessary modifications, in arriving st the basis for theredemption as well as for the conversion of corn rents.           Among the cases completed during the past week is analtered apportionment for which application was made by the GreatEastern Railway Company for the purpose of defining their liability in respect of tithe rentchtfrge in the parish of Palgrave (Suffilk).           The miscellaneous duties carried out by the Branchduring the past week included one field survey in Battersea, London,in connection with a oompulsory redemption of tithe rentcharge in                                                             that

The third of the aeries of deputations that is being organised by the Joint Committee to visit the &quot;Soiling11 experimentsthat ave being so successfully carried out at Havper Adams College,Shropshire, took place on the 24th instant and consisted of selected representatives from the Counties of Anglesey, Cardiganand Pembroke.  The deputation was accompanied by the AgriculturalExperts from the Bangor and Aberystwith ^University Colleges,Reports have been received from members of the, deputation fromGlamorganshire and Carmarthenshire that visited the College on the20th December last.   All speak in the highest possible terms ofthe work that is being done at the College.          Zt is hoped to be able to organise discussions on thereports to be furnished by the respective deputations from the counties represented.          Arrangements Are being made for a member of the Glamorgandeputation to give an address on the &quot;Soiling&quot; system, at the nextmonthly meeting of the Glamorganshire Chamber of Agriculture.          A large number of requests for the Committee*e publicationshave been received during the week,                     jprdnanae Survey,          Maps were despatched as follows:-              War Office         836              Air Ministry       016              Admiralty         15*1              Overseas           286              Other Services     217   /                    Establishment Branch.,          Attention must be drawn again to the serious difficultyattending the Board1e operations unless an early solution can befound to the problem of the Board&apos;s of floe accommodation.)          The incorporation of the business of the Pood production department in the normal organisation of the Board is bound to be greatly hindered whilst it remains necessary for that Sub-Department with ite large staff to carry on its business in officesdistant from Headquarters.          The greatly enlarged scope of the Boards duties rendersit necessary still further to extend their offices and the board are now about to occupy a suite of rooms in yet another building  -Whitehall House, Charing Cross, - for the accommodation of an administrative and olerical staff engaged on a soheme for thedestruction of Rate.          Ho business can be successfully conducted under suchconditions as exist at present and the position is one which mustbe remedied at the earliest moment in the public interest.Portions of the Board1s staff are at present housed in 16different sets of buildings, in many cases at some considerable distance from Headquarters.                                                           What
          &quot;What teems the moat practical solution of the difficulty,   Ias stated in previous reports, is that arrangements should &quot;be madebp the Ministry of Munitions to give up to the Board the buildingwhich was specially built and prepared for the Board1s occupation(Armanont Building), and which was lent to that Department at theoutbreak of war.   tt would then bfi possible to accommodate thewhole of the board&apos;s staff in.that building, and in the housesadjaoent thereto in Whitehall Place which form  the headquarters of the Board at the present moment.          Such a move would enable the Board practically to surrenderthe whole of the accommodation they now oocupy in offices in whitehall, parliament Street? victoria Street, St. Jameses Square,and elsewhere, and effect a substantial saving to the Exchequer inmore than one direction.                    Land, Reclamation.          Practical Surveys of two large areas, one in the Wash andone in Cardigan Bey, are now being carried out t&amp;ith a view toreclamation work being undertaken.   The staff are collectinginformation as to other areas reported to bo ready for reclamation,and in preparatory work in connection with ths acquisition of land,supply of hutments, tools, etc.   An application is being addressedto the Treasury for sanction to the appointment of an additionaloutdoor staff - inspectors and engineers.          The normal work of the Board continues on lines  asindicated in previous Reports.Secretary.89 th January, 1919.
