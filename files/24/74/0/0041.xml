      CIVIL LIABILITIES (DEMOBILISATION) SGHSKE.Memorandum by the President of the Local Government Board.     1.   The War Cabinet havo given general approval to ascheme, which was prepared in accordance with a recommendation contained in the Second (interim) Report of the Committee ontho. Demobilisation of the Army, for the continuation and extension of the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Scheme toofficers and men demobilised from His Hajestyfs Forces:  thoscheme has also been aocopted, subject  to some minor qualifioa-tions, &quot;by the Treasury,  A question-, however, arises ad to theDepartment whioh should bo responsible  for the administratively action of  tho scheme,          It appears to me that the Hinister responsible shouldbe the Minister responsible for demobilisation and not thePresident of the Local Government Board as at present.          In the past the civil  Liabilities scheme has been administered by the Kilitary Service (Oivil Liabilities)Department.  This Department is an independent department and isnot a branch of tho Local Government Board, although$i theePresident of the Local Government Board has hitherto been responsible to Parliament for the administration of theDepartment,  ,     3.   The President of the Local Government Board accepted this responsibility in view of the connection of the work withthe administration of the military Service Acts.          The now scheme however is essentially a scheme ofdemobilisation, and I hope that the Minister of Labour,who is responsible to Parliament for the scheue of demobilisation,will be prepared to take over the Department.     4.   As an additional reason for transferring theDepartment to the Ministry of Labour it may be observed thatthe new Scheme is filoaely connected with the question ofofficers1 resettlement, and the Department of Demobilisationthemselves propose that the scheme should be reobnsidered fromthe point of view of officers1 resettlement on the lines setout in paragraph 5 of Sir StephensOn Kent*s memorandum of 4th January.          If the transfer were effected, the Department ofDemobilisation, instead of merely having aooosa to particulars of individual cases (which Sir Stophenson Kent has suggested  , ;is in itself desirable), would be able  to deal with each oasein all its various aspects concurrently.                                0, ADBISOH.                                        16. 1. 19.Local Government Board,          Whitehall,  S.W.  1.
