MINERS&apos; CLAIi... KiR.. ADVANCE IN 7,&apos;AGES AND REDUCTION                         IN HOURS ETC.     The Miners&apos; Federation have made a demand to the coal controller for an advance of 30 per cent on earnings plus warwages,  i.e. 30 per cent on the earnings resulting from the ordinaryoperation of the sliding scales, with the war wage of 3/- per day in addition,  A3 usual they have stated that they have reduced their demand to the minimum which they oonsider reasonable., andthey have expressed no willingness to discuss any other figure.They have also put forward the following claims under the heading of demobilisaticn:-     (a) That this Conference demands that all demobilised mine         workers shall he fully discharged from the Army and Navy.         and, as soon as they are able, and desire,  to resume work;         shall be zaiaatated in the mines they left at the time         of enlistment,     (b) Any such mine-workers not abl--.&apos; to perform a normal day1 s         work shall be paid th.-.: full wages appertaining to t.ho ;         grade to which they belonged, or would hav-.. belonged had         they not enlisted.     (c) Demobilised mvn who.are partly disabled and unable to         follow work in the mines shall be trained for other         suitable occupation,  and paid during training an allowance         equal to what they would have earned in or;about the mine         had they not been disabled.  The allowance to continue         after training until suitable employment is found.  The         oost of training and allowance to be at the expense of the         State.     (d) Demobilised mine workers and men who arc displaced to make         room for men ^returned from the Army or Navy shall be paid-;         from St at? Funds,  . an out-of-work allowance equal to the         wages th*.y would have  earned had th-vy been employed in and         about the mines,     (e). In no oase shall wages or allowance interfere with pensions         to which suoh discharged soldiers and sailors are, or may         be, entitled,     fft) All matters coming within the above proposals shall be         first dealt with by the Joint pit Committees of mine owners         and mine &apos;. orkers,  and if neoessary, be submitted to the         District Joint Committee.     (g) In order to make easier&apos;the realization of these demands         we press the Government to amend the Pines Eight Hours         Aot so that &quot;six&quot;  hours shall he substituted for &quot;eight&quot;         hours in that&apos; Aot.         Also for this purpose, and in the interests of miners in        ; partioular,  and the community in general,  we urge the         Government to proceed at once to the Nationalisation of   m      all mines and minerals,.!. C RET.(h)
     (h) That the Executive Committee  interview  the Prime         Minister or some other Government  representatives, on         these proposals,  Failing a satisfactory  answer a         further Conference be convened to  determine  the         policy to be adopted to realise these demands,-     2, The claim in respect of wages  was put before  theController of Coal Mines on the 9th January,  The  other pointswer e sutmitt ed To&quot;Tfie id ni st er........of&quot; Lab our, the president of  :the Board of Trade and^intld. &quot;J!p.ae.....Secretary on the&quot;&quot;31st Januaryandanundertaking has been given to the Liners&apos; Executivethat the Government1s reply ocvering all the points will begiven if possible by the end of this week.                    Wages and Hours,     3. The demands for increased wages and reduction in hoursare of a very far-reaching oharEtcter and if oonceded  wouldinvolve very great increases in the price of coal.  It  isestimated that the wage demand alone would  amount  to  about40 millions per annum and that probably about 3/6  to  5/-- perton would have to be added to the present price  of  coal onan annual output of about 250 million  tons. It  is  impracticable to estimate what additional cost would be involved  by theadoption of the^reduced working hour a&quot;,  but it is  clear thatthe concession would still further greatly  increase the priceof coal.     Mr. Smiilie in the interview referred  to admitted that,unless double shifts were worked (a proposal with which semeof the districts will not agree) or unless  there is some otherchange in working arrangements, it would involve a  decrease in output&apos; of about 25 per cent and he claimed  at the  same time thatthe minera&apos; rate of pay must be, made up so  as to enable him to earn as much in six hours as he &apos;does in eight.     The&apos;claim for the 6 hour day is made in respect  of surface workers as well as underground workers,  and it isclear therefore that it is based on considerations  other thanthe disadvantages of working below ground.  One  reason putforward by the miners was the deaire that the reduced hoursshould be put into force in order to absorb labour.4.
    4.  The earnings of the different  classes  of  workmen intho different coalfields show the  greatest  diversity,  and  itis impossible to make any safe generalisation  upon  a National&quot;basis.        The following figures are  taken from typical collieriesin each coalfield j-        Speoimens of Weekly Wages  Earnings  of  different        olasses of persons employed at Coal Mines taken        from typical undertakings  in all Divisions  except        Sootland,  Yorkshire and North  Midlands (Not. yet  -       , received).i PRE-WAR:!i Including&apos;Includ- Includ- subse-    I ing     &apos;ing 2nd; quent     jfirstI scale in-!

The miners1 last increase was in June 1918., when a furtivewar wage of l/6d. per day was conceded.   Immediately followingthat advance, and to some extent in consequence of it,  the-other trades (engineering, shipbuilding, explosives etc,) received by arbitration an advance of 3/6d0 a week - 7d. per  day -  and in Dec-ember 1918, by which date there had been a marked increase in thecost of living these same trades received,  arain by arbitration afurther advance of 5/- per -reel: - lOd. per day0  Assuming that the advances given last Summer left the two groups approximately level as regards war wage advances (an assumption  which is opnn tocuestion in view of the considerable&apos; sliding scale advances pre-viously received by the minors) it will be  seen that the minersare behind to the extent of 5/- per weekc    This  is something very different from their claim, for 30 per cent on earnings.,,     8.  If the pro send demands, which are put forward under amore or less direct threat to cease work, are conceded the effectsarc bound to be far-reaching.   Apart from  the enccura.nem.ent itwould give to the advocates of &quot;direct action&quot; in other trades,theaddition to the price cf coal per hundredweight  (as sold to thesmall consumer) will be serious and  will be  all the more resentedbecause the Unemployment Donation at its present high figure willbe running out and a largo portion of the Indus tr-MLcommunitywhich has been earning hldv wages on munitions work  during thewar period, will be forced, down on a lower  standard of life0Furthermore, the widows of  soldiers, disabled soldiers end soldierwho  arc not able  to obtain  employ went will  also doubtless shot;their resentment  at an  Increase of coal prices,  Tho Treasury woulbe concerned withi&amp;% effect on  Hie position  of the cxoortHtrade.of British coal, while  the position  of the  railways  (already deep-ly-In debt owing  to the wage increase given to the railwaymen],would,be  seriously  compromised by the addition to the price ofcoal.     Some estimate of  the  effect upon  tho cost of iron andsteel arc., in  consequence ivoon  shipbuilding  and other essential industries dependent- upon  these- commodities  may be gatherer from the  following  facts -    (a)   Every ton  of pig  iron requires 2*02 tons of coal          or-its equivalent  in  cokee   This  means  S/- per  ton          extra on pig  iron  and about 15/- per  ton on the         price of steel.                                                            (b)
          (b)  Kearly all the ironstone miners are members               of the Miner&quot;&apos; Federation and would de-^nd               the same increase.          (c)  Consequential increases would follow in the               wages of cokemen and blastfurnacemen.     9,   Thus the re-st .rt of industry on a competitivecommercial basis is bound to be hindered by any considerable increase in the price of coal and by the resultant increasein costs of other commodities; the difficulty of findingemployment for The demobilised forces will be correspondinglyincreased,     10,  The question at. once arises, how are the demands to be dealt with? The claim is openly a claim maue to theGovernment and the Government (as representing the community)are justified in savin;;, that the Miners1 Federation,  inputting forward claims that the rest of the community shallcontribute a large addition to miners&apos; wages, are not entitled to say that they shall themselves fix the amount ofthat contribution and hold up the country if it is notconceded.  The Government can properly reply that the questionwhether, and if so to what extent, miners&apos; wages should befurther increased and the question whether hours shall bereduced are matters which should not be determined by the claimants; they should be dealt with in the same way as theclaims of other trades - by proper enquiry into the facts and circumstances of the case,     11.  The argument in favour of insisting upon an enquiry is unanswerable on grounds of public policy&apos;, but the effect upon the attitude of other trades of any failure so to treat the miners ought to be considered.  It cannot be expectedthat important trades such as the engineers, shipbuilders,chemical workers, building trade operatives, textile operativesand others,  will continue to have recourse to arbitrationif the  miners, by &quot;direct action&quot;, can secure from theGovernment any terms they like to submit.  Nothing is moreunpopular among the Trade Union organisations thanpreferential treatment to any particular section.&apos; If it issuggested that the miners will cease work rather than submit their claim to an enquiry it will be necessary for theGovernment to decide at once to take the public fully into their confidence.  The effects of a stoppage would, of course,at the present period of the year, with stocks at their presentlow level., be most, serious.  Bearing in mind the fact that  theground upon which the Government would take their stand would binsistence on an enquiry as a means of determining what in--crease if any should be given, it may be confidently predictedthat public opinion would be solidly behind the Government,&apos;while the other Trade Unions although they might he sympathet-ically inclined towards the miners if their claims were refusedpoint blank, would not be prepared to see the whole of industryshut down (and their own families put to grave discomfort)merely because the miners had been asked to submit their claim to impartial investigation.
     lk,.  It -will be necessary therefore to ensure atan 6&apos;-rrly stage that the pros6&apos; and the public fullyunderstand what is the point ot issue - not with aview to prejudicing the merits of the miners&apos; claimsbut solely to explain what the claims are and to whom they are made and to state the  reasons which make itexpedient that the claims should be investigated by ani mp ar t i al tr i bun al,     13.  The procedure which ia proposed is that theGovernment should intimate- to the miners that thereis no desire to view unsymp .thetically their wish toimprove their standing and conditions of life.  Theyshould be offered at once whatever amount by way ofadditional war wage is due to them on the ground of increase in the co^t of living since they receivedtheir last advance,  lor example tney. might he offered the .same automatio cost-of-living scale whichhas been accepted by the National Union of Ra.il way men,i.e, a scale which would give the miners an advanceof 1/- per week for each 4 per cent increase in thecost of living since June 1918, i.e. 5/- a week,In practice tnis vould mean practically l/- per dayon the war wage,   &apos;  14.  With regard to the other questions - includ-ing the balance of the r,ages-claim and the reductionof hours it should be point d out that the^e are of apermanent character and would affect not only the coaltraae but also the whole position, of the industrial life of- the country, and it is suggested, therefore that the miners should be informed that the government intend to establish at once a strong, representativecommittee on which the miners would nominate theirown representatives to enquire into the matters raised..     15,  The proposed ooinmittoe should be empoweredalso to enquire into the  rages of the various grades of coal miners.  The -wages of some of these grades have always been low and there wold seem to b:? a case forspecial consideration in the case of the men in thesegrades.     15.  The terms of reference should be sufficientlywide to enable the Oovm-dttee to consider such questions as the organisation of the working of the pits, theuse of tubs, improved haulage, etc... These arc matterswhioh have always been subjects of contention betweenthe workpeople and the management and for many years it has been alleged that the output of the minescould be increased if improved facilities were avail.-aable.     1*7,  Finally the Committee could,, if the Govern-ment so dosire, or tho miners pressed it, be askedto report on the /                                      future
future position of the coal industry under which head theywould of course be entitled to consider any scheme that may besubmitted to them in the way of joint control of the industry,national control, or nationalisation.  In this vay they couldexamine the organisation of the industry including cost ofproduction and distribution, selling prices and profits, andit would be open to them to make recommendations on theseheads*     18. It should be an instruction to the Committee to dealfirst and expeditiously with the claim on &apos;ages and hours ofwork, and present and interim report on these questions0     19. The miners&apos; case does not stand alone - the railwaymen are putting forward another large claim for higher%ages and the manner in which the miners&apos; case is dealt withwill set the paee for the railwaymen.     It is considered that the time has come when the-G;v -nmrnent should determine that direct negotiation on wagesand other claims (accompanied by threats to stop work)between Government representatives and the irade Unions must give place to a more judicial method of settlement and since,in&apos; the present case, the employers concerned cannot themselvesnegotiate owing to Government control of their property, theonly course open to the Government is to insist on an enquiry.-   &apos;                Demobilisation Claims.     20. The. claims made by the miners in connection withdemobilisation, if granted, would -put them in an exceptionaloosition compared ?ith the rest of the citizens of the country*     (a) Their first claim is for complete discharge on         demobilisation, whereas all other soldiers are         technically kept in the Reserve in order to provide&apos;         for any possible emergency in connection with the         peace negotiations.     -(b) They demand that a mine worker not able to perform         a normal days&apos; work is to have the full wages that he         could have earned as a miner*  This does not seem         to- refer to men disabled or partly disabled, - because -         these are dealt with in the newt demand, and therefore         it would appear that a miner, apparently able-bodied,         is to be guaranteed a full days wage whatever work         he does.     (c) They ask that a partly disabled man unable to work         in the mines should be traine  for another occupation         and, during the period of training and until suitable         employment is thereafter found for him, is to receive         a full -riner&apos;s wage.  In the ordinary case of a         disabled soldier receiving training the amount of         benefit- is 33/- per week, with certain allowances in         the cases of men who have families.  No reason is         suggested for giving the miners exceptional treatment         in this respect.     (d) They claim that a man displaced fro - the mines to         make room for a returned soldier shall receive a full         minerfs wage.   This compares with an out-of-^or/k         donation to people in other trades in similar Position                                                           of
- 8 -211      of 29/- a week,,  Further, no suggested term is put to the period      during which this out-of work donation is to be paid..     21. These demands are obviously extravagant in character.  Itis suggested that the reply of the Government to the miners shouldpoint out these differences, and explain&apos;that the scheme which is applicable to all the rest of the country must be equally appliedto the miners.(Signed)  E.
