LOCAL uLBiClIONo IH Tii): YftAii 1919. .---.......................----------ranclum by the President of. the Local government Board.          For the past three &quot;yean there have been no elections of local authorities in this country. *  Vacancies as they have occurred,have been filled, by co-option.   The elections will,however, recommence this year.          The first elections are those of the County Councilswhich take place in the first&apos; week of u/larch-.   These arefollowed by elections of urban and rural district councils andboards of guardians which take place at the beginning of April,,and the elections of municipal borough councils and metropolitan borough councils which take place in November.          The proposal has been made whether, seeing that the personnel of these local bodies has continued so long withoutchange, it. would be desirable to provide that there should be complete new elections of the whole of these local bodies inthe present year.   An additional argument, in favour of thisis the fact that the electorate has been remodelled andlargely increased under the Representation of the PeopleAct, 1913.          The system under which these bodies are electedvaries.   In the case of the county councils, metropolitan borough councils and a certain number of district councils and boards of guardians the whole body of councillors andguardians retire together every third year*   In the case ofthe municipal borough-&quot;1, and the majority of district councils and guardians one-third Of the councilloro end guardiansretire each year, the third being those who have beenlongest in office, and their places are filled by a newelection.                        *          County councils and borough councils have inaddition aldermen who are co-opted by the oouncil.   Thealdermen are elected for six years and one-half of themretire every third year.          To carry the foregoing proposal into effect a 3illwould be necessary to provide . for;.the whole of the aldermenand. councillors to go out.  of of i ice on the ordinary day of retirement in the present  year one! for a complete new election.It would al &apos;-o be necessary to nr tee provision for the reintro-duction of the  \y--tem of retirement by thirds (or in the caseof aldermen the retirement by halves) in subsequent years.:so as to determine which individuals shall retire In &quot;eachyear.          The Municipal Corporation&apos; Association, who were consulted on the subject in the. Autumn were opposed to any interference with the anrual system of election on theground that it would -*poil - the continuity of administration j-and it i-j therefore likely that the borough members ofParliament will be pressed to oppose the complete retirement of member&apos;- of a borough council.          The existence of the new electorate will be used by the opponents of the,3111 as an argument in support of theircontention.   They will allege that the uncertainty as to how
the new electorate may vote mqkea - t the more important thatthe constitution of the whole of the council should not beplaced in their hands.                        :.          There in. a good deal to be said for a complete newelection on the ground of prolonged tenure of office, thepresence of a new electorate and that a number of councillorshave been co-opted whom; it would be difficult to continue in^office whilst certain elected members are compulsorily&apos;?retired, and both my immediate predecessors in office were infavour of a Bill, to this end, but looking to the fact that itis not possible to get the 3111  ;n time to affect the QOuntyCouncil Aldermen and to the anticipated opposition of the  !boroughs 1 am inclined to confine the Jill to the case;&apos;ofcouncillors and leave out the reference to aldermen.  .Thiawould allow in the cose of the boroughs the half of thealdermen who have been the shortest time in office to remain for another three years, and&apos; so to some extent would meet thedesire for continuity. &apos;  A Draft 3111 on-the lines proposed is annexed.       &apos; ;\&apos;&apos;   &apos; ;          The Bill rnustbe passed early in inarch if it. is to affect the spring elections of District Qfeuneii- uareliftna.Councillors and Guardians.                            \)C, ADDI30H.GOVERNMENT 30AHD, Whitehall, S.W.1.29,1.19,
