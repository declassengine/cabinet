WAR CABINET.,SECRET.G.T,679j.            iLA2EJ? 1 R TRAIT3P ORT ATI Oil   JttJERI CAN TROOPS IN                         &quot; BRITISH &quot;SHIPSr( M jS2r andUTQ by; Ior d Re ad ing.)      The.Cabinet will remember that a somewhat seriouscontroversy arose in October of last year between theUnited States Government and the British Government as tothe rates to be charged for the transportation of american troops on British ships,   The matter was before theCabinet on October 9th,. when by resolution it was decidedthat it should be left to me to settle it with the UnitedStates Government,   Since that time delay has occurred due in the first place to Mr, Secretary Baker1s wish to awaitray return to Washington to discuss the matter and in thesecond to the postponement of my return.to the United Statesowing to the visits first of Colonel House and later of president Wilson to Europe *   Eventually Mr. Secretary Bakersent General Hines ever here, with full powers to settle thematter on behalf of the United States Government.      It had previously been agreed between Mr, Baker and methat the rates of transportation should be based u$br. trie-actual cost to the British Government of the use of 7ess elsfor this purpose.   The difficult question was to ascertainthis cost. .  At my suggestion General Hines immediately upon his arrival placed himself in communication with Sir JosephHaelay and Sir Graeme Thomson.   He has had all the figuresplaced before him and the result of his examination of them is that an agreement has been arrived at with my approvalon behalf of the British Government which disposes satisfactoril-of all matters in controversy^      The important rate under discussion was that for the transportation of the American private soldier, which isnow settled at  16 per man.   This is considerably less thanthe original figure put forward by the; British Government tothe IT. S.Government, namely  2 , but is in excess of th--- ratesuggested, by the U.S.Government., to- the British Gov^rnm^nt,based upon British Blue Book rat^s, which it was computedwould Jp**  10 to  11.   The diff *rt*nce - between the  16 and 2? rate-  is of course partly due tc a reduction in the warrisk Wi-sscd upon actual instead of as hitherto conjectural.figures.   The rate of  16 is not a precise arithmeticalcalculation but represents the figure proposed by GeneralHines after close examination by Kim of the details submittedto him by the. British Government.   This proposal was brought before me by Sir Joseph Haclay and Sir&apos;Graeme Thomson and Iunhesitatingly approved its acceptance after hearing theiropinion in favour of the proposal.IIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY  OE HIS  3EITAEEI0 MAJESTY&apos; S GOVlHRmOT -
          I desired, however, before arriving at a&apos; final  conclusion with General Hines, to be convinced that he  was really satisfied r/ith the proposed terms,   Ths  following personal telegram, from me to Mr. Baker, United  States secretary for &apos;: ar, states the substance of my  interview with General Hines:         &quot;  I am delighted that General Hines and I were       able to settle the transportation rates question       yesterday after a detailed examination, by&apos;-him of       cost to British Government.    As I told you when       you -ere here, British Governments desire was to       arrive at conclusions which would leave U, S..       Government really satisfied that the rates to be       charged are fair and equitable rates representing       not more than true cost to British Government,       I repeated substance of our former conversation       as detailed above to General nines. -   He gave me       the most satisfactory assurances upon these points.       Ke explained to me that it was only by detailed       examination of figures that one could arrive at       true cost, that all information had been placed       before him by the British Government and that he       was quite satisfied on behalf of the U0 So Govern-     &apos;. ment with the conclusions proposed.    He added       that just as British Government did not wish to       charge more so the U.S, Government, did not vish       to pay less than a fair.rate representing not more       than cost to British Government,            The proposed conclusions are based upon actual       figures mainly ascertained and indeed only ascor-       tainabie since the original figures were placed       before U. S. Government,    &quot;Upon these mutual  , r       assurances of satisfaction with the conclusions,,       General nines and I signed the agreement..  I world       add that the British Government highly appreciates       your having sent General Hines with full powers:  &apos;       he was evidently imbued with a desire to arrive       at the true facts from which to draw fair and       equitable conclusions.            I shall hope soon to see you in \T&apos;s shington * &quot; .        General Hires has also assured me that immediately on his return he will take steps to wlace the settlementof this controversy before the &quot;American public in as favourable a light as. that in which he himself regards it.i\n official statement for Press publication will be shown to me by General nines..   This shall be cabledto the British Press,2P ?hitehell Gardens. S..-.1.     February 13. 1919.
