Wo have been called upon by the Treasury to out down the       Annual Estimates for the year 1919-20 to the lowest possible amount       and this process  of curtailment has been carried out in conference       with the Treasury           I an  not sufficiently acquainted with the position in regard       to unemployment to offer an authoritative opinion, but I under-       stand  that there is a tendency for unemployment  to increase and       private enterprise is not proceeding as rapidly as had been       anticipated.  In the oircnimstances,  I would ask for a decision from       the  War Cabinet as to whether or not my Department is to take       immediate  steps to proceed with l&amp;b large emergency programme.           The necessary expenditure would probably have to be mot by       means  of Supplementary Estimates,    Supplementary Estimates,       in any case, will appear to be necessary for my Department9 and       any expenditure under this emergency programme could be met in a       similar way                          *                                      (Sd, ) AMiUD MOID,.H.M. Office of Works, &apos;    13th February, 1919.
