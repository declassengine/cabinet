        .    SjgJTRICTION OF IHTOKTS.MEMOE/iNDUM BI Tffl&quot;ppJsiiSi OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.       In addition to the cessation  of  imports  from  enemy  countries, restrictions hs?e nad to be imposed  during the war  upon imports from Neutrals and Allies on  accounts of the short-  age of shipping and for Exchange reasons.  Under this arrange-  ment all articles placed on the restricted list were only  allowed into the country through the  issue of a licence.  On  the cessation of hostilities the number of separate entries on  this list numbered about 150..   .     i During the War there have  alse been  further limitations.  of imports into this country tnrough  the establishment of export  restrictions by the countries of origin and through the short-  age of-shipping,  which automatically  had  the  effect of largely  reducing imports.       SinM the Armistice the Shipping position has rapidly  iaprot&amp;d,  so that now there is  probably more  tonnage available-  than there are goods to be carried. -Therefore practically all  restrictions upon imports could, so far as -shipping is con-  concerned.  be cancolled.   But there still remains the question  of the balance of trade;  and a  further and perhaps mo e import-  ant question has developed since the Armistice, on which strong  representations have been made  to the Board of Trade.       The difficulties which surround many of  our inchistriea in  re-establishing themselves approximately in the position that  they occupied prior to the war has led  to the request tharthe  free flow of imports into the country should be restricted,  so far as these industries are  concerned, until they have had  an opportunity of overcoming, partially at least, the dasabui-  ties which have been placed upon them owing to the war,  More-  over there are the industrial businesses \mich have been  created  or expanded,  owing to the necessities arising from  shortage of imports,  and perhaps under (fovernment encouragement;  and here again it is suggested  that time should be givendor  them to  further their plans before the imports which would  prejudice  their development are allowed to enter freely.  In  both cases it is  urged that if  this is not done the provision  of employment for demobilised soldiers will be gravely  prejudiced,  A good illustration Is afforded by the motor oar  industry.   This has been almost  entirely.taken up during the.  war by Government Work.   Some important companies have not-mnc  the outbreak of mx made a single car  of the  types for moh  they had gained their names.  They have not been able to -  prepare  new designs,  still less  to manufacture new models,.
If foreign oars are allowed to come in freely, oven withthe existing customs duty, before the British makers have time to revert to their ordinary trade, tho foreign manurac-turers who aro offering new models will be able to create agood will, which will make the recovery of the British Makers1position difficult and slow. American Manufacturers inparticular have boon much lose affected by war work than british Manufacturersi and it is believed that they could easily flood the British market with their cars.  Moreoverlarge numbers of Army vehicles will shortly be put up forsale, which is a further reason for preventing the marketfrom being glutted with imports.     As additional illustrations, mention may be made of rubber tyres, Agricultural Implements, Boots and Shoes,Cotton hosiery and glovos, Manufacture of Saccharine,Optical glass and Optical Instruments, and many other oasesmight be cited.     The countries that would bo chiefly affected by therestriction of imports are the United States and Japan aridboth aro equipped to export to this oountry on a large scale.Japanese industries havo not been di3organisod, on thecontrary they hav^ dovolopod * and Americans are far losedisorganised than ours.     Moreover tho change in tho Trade balance broughtabout by the war is great in the caoo of the United Statesand Japan, as shown by tho figures below:-                             (In  1,000).United Statos		Japan	1913 Imports into U.K. 141,658 Exports from U.K. 59,-153	1918 1515,979	1913 4,388 14,827	1913 25? ,-8855 7,373Excess of Imports 82,199	489,557	10,439	16,510                       Exoss3 cf exports.     It- is true that the 1&amp;18 figures include imports on war account, which are very large in the case of the tinitodStates, and cannot therefore be compared fairly with those for 1913 which are solely trade figures, but, obviously,it is of groat Importance that imports from theso countries should be kopt down.     It may further bo noted that the present New Yorkrate of exchange on London is only $ 4.765 to  1 againsta par rate of 4.867; i.e. sterling is.at a discount ofover 2 per cent.     In Japan British currency is 5 to 6 per cent bolow par.This means&apos;that, a loos is incurred on all remittances tothe United States and Japan.
      Against this moreover we cannot set a-satisfuctorrgeneral trade position.
