      iiiPLSl-iSNTARY MEMORANDUM  W  TKS  FOOD  CONTROLLER OJJ  THSfeiBTiv^v------&quot;                    &apos;    .....&quot;            SITUATION AS AFFECT ,D  67 INDTJ3TRL.L  UNREST,        ^$ndustrial unrest,  I had already,  on the 10th February,J^^0J^$J^ a  Memorandum on  the general  position  of food supplies  in  thei^Ms^5T  an interruption of railway  and other transport services^ It will probably be sufficient to  supplement this by notes  on  some of the special points raised  at  yesterday&apos;s  meeting of  the  Cabinet: (1) PR3TECTION OF HERDS OF  CATTLE  Dj 0: EM  COUNTRY,       &quot;The possibility of giving such protection is, of course, mainly a  question for the police and the  military authorities^  I  have fur- nished to  the Committee on  Industrial Unrest a statement of the numbers of cattle, sheep and pigs in  each  county,  and It will be possible for the local  police and military authorities, by communication with  the Livestock  Commissioners, to conoert  any local measures  for  protection that may  be practicable,  I very much doubt, however, whether  it  is really practicable to protect herds  while in the open country*  It seems improbable that sufficient  force would  be available for the purpose while the  cattle are scattered,  and  there would  be great difficulty  in feeding them  if the;/ were collected. All that can be done  is  I think;      (a)  To  authorise the  Livestock Commissioners, In  any  special      case where this is feasible  and necessary  to collect  the cattle      and  arrange for their protection,      (b)  To  arrange for any  increased  killings  that may be necessary,      to  take place principally  in districts that are likely to be      dlsturbod,    -  A meeting of Livestock  Commissioners has been held this  afternoon when theso points were dealt  with.      Arrangements are also being  made  to maintain the  supplies of meat, so far as  possible, in the  event of  a strike fas was done  in the  case of a recent strike on the Great  Western Railway)o (2) THE POSSIBILITY OF LOWERING  PRICES  :      The  suggestion made by  Mr, AifrTEen Chamberlain has he en under investigation in respeot of each food of  which the Ministry held  stocks; and stops  have been taken,  or are  on the  point of being taken; which will; I hope, result In a reduction  of  prices of margarine  and of bacon (though the latter reduction  will  depend  upon whether the  Y/orld pricec cLo in fact fall),  I think,  however, that the anticipated  industrial unrest will make it harder  and not easier to proceed rapidly with this natter,   To meet a  widespread  strike it  is  essential to  induce whole- . wholesalers and retailers to carry large  stocks;  to hold out prospect  of  an early fall In prices is the most direot way  of preventing  thorn from doing this-STt3&apos; THE DISTRIBUTION OF BEER  :   &quot;&quot;&quot;rEe Cabinet decision to allow an increase of 25$ on a statutorybarrelage was notified to the trade and the public on February 4th*  Asthe process of manufacture and distribution occupies a period of from10 to 20 days for the lighter classes cf beer and longer for the heavi-  ones, the full effect of the concession cannot be felt by the publicuntil another week or ten days,  This explains why the  advantage  isnot already being felt,&apos;4) GENERAL FOOD POSITION :     As is stated in my &quot;Memorandum of 10th February, the general  din-tribution of food is relatively satisfactory,&apos;and given a maintenanceof road transport, there should be no impossibility in preventing  serious&apos;ocal shortages for some weeks at least.  The supplies of flour held  by-he Ministry of Food are particularly well distributed and, in addition,die recent issues of flour (which have been higher than at any previousperiod) indicate that probably the trade and  the public are well stocked,London itself has probably flour for 3j to 4  weeks (in the hands of thotakers and of the Ministry) and about 14 weeks&apos; supply of WHTKVT,   It has*lso ample supplies of bacon  and good supplies of frozen meat.  detailed information, as to the Ministry of Food stocks of flour, frozen meat,Preserved meat, bacon and sugar, in each town, has been furnished  to  the
- A* i\* ,\tlCommittee on Industrial Unrest/ and has also been sent to each of the Food Commission era..        For practical dealing with W&amp;a. local shortages in tho  -event of a strike, action must clearly, be decentralised, andthe Ministry of Food will act through the Food Commissioners andthe Livestock Commissioners, whose business it has always been to see te the distribution of food and who have been givendetailed instructions for the purpose.Ministry of Food,   11th February 1919,G.H.
