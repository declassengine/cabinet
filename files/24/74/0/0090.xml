  .....LQIS L^fHDJf^li8 v- Property of   ^NTKMBIQ^S THE   :                 &quot;349mm OF THS board OF TRADE,                     January.  1919.      I circulate for the  information  of the War IVibinet  the following &quot;brief account  of the  work of the Board of Trade during the month of January 1919,, which deals  only with  a few or the more important questions likely to  interest my colleagues and i&apos;docs not  profess to he an account of  the ordinary departmental work of the Board, or to include all,,the important questions  considered  by the Department. 10th February, 1919,                                    A.H. STAKE!.                   GOMUSBQB AND INDUSTRY.     The Board of Trade have issued a general licence underthe Trading with the Enemy legislation authorising personsin this-country to trade with Palestine and Syria.  Theyhave also a granted a licence to the Levant Company to exporta quantity 01 Manchester goods, boots^ clothing &amp;c*, to constantinople on an undertaking that the goods will not be disposed or on arrival there without the permission of theBritish Authorities.  The question of granting licences to other approc-iwBritish firms on similar terms is beingconsidered in consultation with the Allied Authorities atConstantinople,     Certain very heavy indreases of import duty were intrd-introduced into the Brazilian Budget Law for 1919 without notice and came into operation on 1st January.  The British exporttrad6 mainly&apos; affected is that in earthenware which isimportant and i3 looking to South America as an increasinglyvaluable market after the wara  Grave apprehension is felt by British pottery manufacturers at the enormous increases of duty and much resentment is expressed at the fact thatthe increases on Chinaware are smaller with the result thatBritish earthenware will be unable to compete with Continentalchinaware (which before the War was largely exported byGermany ana Austria.)  The Board have asked the ForeignOffice to make urgent representations to the Brazilian Govern-ment with a view to the suspension of the new duties.      -During the month the General Licences for manufacturedgoods issued on the signing of the Armistice were revokedas from 1st March next in consequence of an undertaking Igave to restore the prohibitions temporarily removed in order to give due weight to the interests of home manufact-manufacturers before finally relaxing control over imports.  since this undertaking was given very numerous applications have been received objecting to licensing any imports of articles which applicants are able to produce.  The whole questionof licensing subsequent to the restoration of the prohibitionsis under consideration.
     ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOW BEING MADE,  WITH TREASURY SANE-TION. FOR AN EXHIBITION IN LONDON OF TIMBER GROWN WITHINTHE EMPIRE (INCLUDING HOME GROWN TIMBER)  IN OCTOBER NEXT.     SIR JOHN SNELL IS INTERVIEWING REPRESENTATIVES OF ALLELECTRICITY UNDERTAKERS WHO DESIRE EXTENSIONS OF PLANT,WITH A VIEW TO SECURING THAT ANY EXTENSIONS MADE SHALL,AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, CO-ORDINATE WITH THE  NEW PROPOSALSFOR THE SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY,   WITH THE SAME OBJECT.THE DEPARTMENT CONCERNED WITH LOANS TO LOCAL authorities for ELECTRICITY PURPOSES HAS AGREED TO SUBMIT ALL such applications TO THE BOARD OF TRADE,     FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND DEALTWITH ON THIS MATTER,,   THE AMENDMENT OF THE COURTS emergency powers ACTS TO PROVIDE, INTER ALIA, FOR THE dissolution of PRE-WAR AND EARLY WAR CONTRACTS, WITH OR WITHOUTDAMAGES, WHEN THEIR PERFORMANCE HAD BEEN MADE ONEROUS BYTHE WAR, IS UNDER CONSIDERATION,   IT IS URGED THAT THECOURTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL THECIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, INCLUDING ANY OFFER WHICH HADBEEN MADE FOR THE MODIFICATION OF THE CONTRACT,   THO board are IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE LORD CHANCELLOR REGARDING.I&amp;E^.QUESTION.     A DEPUTATION HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERATION OFMASTER COTTON SPINNERS1 ASSOCIATION REGARDING ORDERS ONTHEIR BOOKS FROM HOLLAND, SCANDINAVIA, AND SWITZERLAND,WHICH THEY ARE UNABLE TO EXECUTE OWING TO THE withholding of EXPORT LICENCES.   IT WAS SAID THAI, FOR SEVERAL REASONS^WORK IN OONNEXION WITH THESO ORDERS CANNOT BE PUT IN HANDUNTIL PERMISSION HAS BEEN GRANTED FOR THE EXPORT OF THEGOODS, AND IT WAS URGED THAT FROM THE POINT OF view BOTHOF AFFORDING EMPLOYMENT AT THE PRESENT TIME AND OF EXPEDITEING A RESUMPTION OF NORMAL TRADE, IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE ITHAT ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE MADE TO PERMIT GOODS TO be shipped TO THE COUNTRIES MENTIONED.     CONVERSATIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THE BOARD OFTRADE AND SIR PHILIP NASH WITH REGARD TO THE POWERS OFTHE TWO DEPARTMENTS IN CONNEXION WITH THE ESTABLISHMENTOF A MINISTRY OF FAYS AND COMMUNICATIONS.PAPER CONTROL.     THE SCANDINAVIAN SHIPPING SITUATION REMAINS EASY,AND NORTH ATLANTIC RATES HAVE NOW BEEN REDUCED TO A more reasonable LEVEL - ABOUT ONE-FIFTH OF THE RATES RE-CENTIY DOMRA&amp;OD*   THE NEW RATES WILL PERMIT THE INTRO-DUCTION OF A NEW AND SALUTARY COMPETITION WITH SCANDIN-AVIAN CHEMICAL WOOD PULP a(2)
     The amounts paid into the Controller^ accountduring January total  397,035,13.3. comparing with 6177980 for December and  127,000 for November.     The competitive offers of Scandinavian paper arecausing unrest and discontent among consumerc xn thiscountry who urge the removal of all restrictions on imports of manufactured paper.   The Department has taken up the attitude that licensed imports oi paper shouldnot be increased until the British Hills have been afforded.an opportunity of resuming operations.                    COAL CONTROL.     Tho miners have put forward a demand for a six-hourday and an increase or 30$ on present wages, excluding  ,&apos;the two war wages amounting to 3/- per ton.    The matter has been referred to the War Cabinet:.     The steps which wero taken to represent to Ihe ItalianGovernment the objections from the point of view of theBritish oo&amp;l trade tc the proposed Government monopolyin coal in Italy have been so far successful that th*proposal, if not abandoned, is left in abeyance.   Thamatter is toing followed up with a view to securing therescission of the decree and the restoration of normalrelations between British exporters and Italian importersas from the 1st Harch, on which date the chartering oftonnage becomes free.     Communications have passed between the Coal controller and tho Foreign Office on the subject of the terminationof the Norwegian and Spanish Coal and Shipping Agree-ments.   It is hoped that both agreements, which involvecertain obligations as to coal prices, will be terminatedat an early date.THIBET; CONTROL.     All control of imported hardwoods is to be removed from 1st March.   Stocks of such hardwoods held by the timber Supply Department, will, as far as possible, be disposed or m convenient lota by auction sales, tnefirst of which is expected towards the end of February.
      It  is prebable  that all control of imported softwood will be removed, *t tho one. of March, but-no  alticuncemsht hao  yet wen made.  before the control  is removed it Is hoped to arrange for the purohaso ahead of about six months1 aupply in  order to safeguard the position.  The maxi- mum prices for imported softwood are about to be reduced.      Maximum $rices  $or imported pitwood hava been  reduced as from 17th Mruary by a Notice issued under the Rtwood Order, 1918, on 28th January.      Permission will also be given to purchase and bring in pi two ad from Spam, Portugal, and Newfoundland to Bristol Channel Ports for the South Mas Collieries, and from Scandinavia and Finland  in sailing ships to north itfast Coast Ports.      The windin^-up  of the Departments opera- tione in producing home-grown timber will noces- sarily continue for  some time, perhaps a year. It was necessary during the War to purchase ahead, ttd the Departs&amp;nt holds many millions ef cubic feet oz standing timber, of which it will be  necessary to dispose either to the orig- finally  sellers or the  Timber Trade, or in other case8 to work as originally planned, according to circumstances.                       BBS.KM     A meeting of the Dyes Trade and LicensingCommittee was held on tne 30th January at whichvarious matters of policy and procedure were considered.-  It was decided that the import ofdrestuffs after the war should be controlledthrough a central importing and distributingagency which should be under the direct super-vision of the Licensing Sub-Committee.  Tha pre-cise form of this agency is at present underconsideration.(4)
