asponsibility for the Administration of  the        Civil Liabilities Scheme.Note for the War Cabinet by SIR AvC. GEDDES;as Minister Co-ordinating Demobilisation.       I wish oo call attention to the necessityof an immediate decision of the question which department of State is to be responsible for theadministration of the Civil Liabilities Scheme *which is at present controlled, by the LocalGovernment Board *   I understand that the Presidentof the Local Government Board is of opinion that thescheme should be under the. control of the Ministryof Labour through the Director General of CivilDemobilisation and Resettlement; and I think thatthere would be great advantages in this arrangement.The essential point, however., is that it should be definitely settled without delay which Department isto be responsible as the present uncertainty is hamperingadministration and is prejudicial to the interests of applicants.       It is important also that an early decision should be arrived at on the allied question of theAdministration of the Retail Business Licensing Order,1918, as to which I have forwarded a separate memorandum in my capacity as Minister of National Service,                             (Signed)  A, 0 . desire-.Ic2,19.
