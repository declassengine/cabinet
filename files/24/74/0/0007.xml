IIWII iii).....MM..... ilium.......Hi i mm &apos;          The Sugar Beet Growers* Seolety Is a propagandist body whichraised    a guaranteed fund kt  10,001 amongst its members in order topromote the sugar beet industry in England, and to make enquiries asto the most suitable means of getting a faetory started.    The society in the first instance conducted a number tf experiments en the growth of sugar beet on a Otittftafa&amp;ve&amp;y large scale and on the composition ofthe produce, and investigated a number *f estates which were in themarket from the point of view of their suitability as sites for a factory and as centres for sugar beet growing en a large eo&amp;le,          2t is agreed that a modem sugar beet enterprise requires anestate attached to it on which it can grow a eonsiderable acreage of sugar beet under Its own control in order to regulate the suppliescoming forward to the factory.   As a result of the enquiries theSociety fixed upon an estate of 5,600 acres at Kelham, near Newark, ascombining most of the facilities required for the enterprise.   Aooneiderable portion of the estate 1B itself suitable for the growth ofthe crop.   It is the centre of an agricultural district from which the-bulk of the supplies oould be expected to be grown by the farmers-&apos;in occupation, having regard to the nature of the soil and the style ofagriculture followed.   The communications both by rail and water are good, and the estate include8 a convenient factory site on the banks of the River Trent,    As the price at which the estate oould be acquired was a cheap one,  one of the members of the Society acquiredtfys estate with the purpose ef handing It over to the Society.   Anapplication was then put before the development Commission for a ,loanip enable the Boolety to acquire the estate,  the intention being toget the   tat8 ready for sugar beet growing and to proceed with the  .erection of the factory as circumstances permitted.,   The Beard ofAgriculture approved of the scheme and eventually the Treasury, throughthe Development Commissioners, advanced  125,000 for the  purchase ofthe eetate, It being understood that a soheme for the erection of thefactory and the manufacture ef sugar,  ad soon as the termination of &apos;the war permitted ef building, would be submitted by the Scoiety.Should the Society fail to obtain capital from the public in order to erect and conduct the factory the Board of Agriculture expressed thefrintention ef seeing the experiment in the commercial manufacture of sugar carried through, either as a purely State enterprise or by someother means.   Meantime,  the management of the estate was handed overto the Board of Agriculture as mortgagees in possession,  they holdingthe estate as security for the purchase money which had been advance!by the Treasury to the Society.   A further loan  Of .640,000 was madeby the Development Commissioners as working capital for the farmingof the estate.   Possession was acquired on port of the estate atLady Day, 1918, and ooneiderable progress has been made in bringing the estate into a sound      condition of cultivation.   The estatewas very well bought and could undoubtedly be re-eeld at  the presenttime at a considerable profit.
           In July  1918  a  deputation from the Society waitedupon  the President of the Board of Agriculture in order to pressupon  him the need  for immediate action with a view to raisinga crop of  beet and erecting a factory for the manufacture of sugar in 1920, and as an  outcome of this deputation in which themembers of the Society  stated that they were in the position toraise capital if the Government submitted an equivalent amount,a scheme was prepared and submitted to the Board of Agriculture.After discussion  of the  details of the scheme the Board ofAgriculture submitted the revised proposals to the Treasury onthe 4th September.           The basis of  the proposals was that the Society and theGovernment should provide equal amounts of capital to the extentof a  maximum of  250,000  each, the latter amount to include the.sums  already provided by  the Treasury, - 5125,000 for the purchaseof the estate and  40,000 for the purpose of equipment of theKelhara estate.  An experimental period of ten years was to befixed during which to test out the possibilities of the sugar  *industry in this country  and during that period interest wouldbe paid on the capital  subscribed by  the public at War Loan rates.The State would only receive interest on its capital in so faras the profits permitted  after due provision for depreciation hadbeen  made.  A point of  considerable importance in the soheme wasthat  the depreciation during these ten years should be taken at such  a rate as would write off the excess oosts of building andequipment  during the abnormal war period.          At the close  of the experimental period the jpuhlio-subscribers and the State would remain holding oapibtal to an equal extent but the iirtere&amp;t on the Stated oapltal Vouldthereafter be limited to  the current Government rats of interessees-fr &apos;on loans.  Any deficits during the experimental period in theinterest due to the Covernr ant would be funded and receiveinterest or be paid off only after the share capital subscribedby the public had been paid 15$.  According to the soheme themanagement was to be in the hands of the public subscribers butthe Treasury were to appoint a financial representative on theBoard with a power of veto respecting such arrangements as therate  of depreciation and  of dividend.  In case of liquidation atthe close of the experimental period the assets would be sharedequally between the Government and the public shareholders.          On these terms, if the scheme were completelysuccessful, the State would subscribe capital on which it would,receive its normal rate cf interest but no more.  The publicsubscribers would receive a War Loan rate of interest for tenyears and then all the profits made by the enterprise.  If the Ischeme failed the State stood to lose the excess oo3ta ofworking during the experimental period, including the payment ofiaterest on the money subscribed by the public and a half shareof the loss on realisation of the assets.  The public subscribingcapital were guaranteed a r&amp;r loan interest for ten years, butthey would have to share  in the loss on realisation, diminished,however,  by the writing off during the war period of the warcost  of building.          On receipt of this application at the instance of theDevelopment Commission the Treasury referred to a proposal whichhad been seceived by the Development Commission from the Co-operative Wholesale Society to undertake the erection cf a sugar
t) 5  faotory  on condition that  the  Development  Fund would  guarantee aI sum equal  to  half the losses incurred during the  first  five years  up  to  a  maximum of  50,000. and asked that enquiries,should he again  addressed  to  that &quot;body in  order to  see if  they were prepared  to  conduct  the &quot;business on the same or similar terms.. The Board of  Agriculture- have been unable to obtain a definite proposal from the  Co-operative  wholesale Sooiety,  and therefore re-submitted the  original proposal of the Sugar Beet Growers&apos;  Society  to the Treasury.          As to the general  prospeots of- sugar beet growing in  this  country, I am adrised that it  may be regarded as  quite  certain that  sugar  beet of hjgh quality can be grown by farmers in this country  at  a oost  which will compare favourably with that grown elsewhere.  There  can  be  no doubt,  again,  but that the crop would form a  valuable  item in  the systems ef English farming in  many parts  of England,  It  would  be of vs&amp;ue to the farmer as  a root  crop which  he could sell  for cash;   it would encourage  higher cultivation  and  more intensive  manuring,  and so re-act on ai:, the  crops in the rotation;  and it  would  add  to  the employment of labour on the land.          As to the possibilities of  manufacturing  sugar  at a profit  if  the beet were procurable from the farmer at prices comparable to  those  paid in Continental  countries, 1 am  unable  to pronounce a  judgment.   It is precisely on  that  point that a commercial experiment  is  necessary;  but I am so convinced of the value of  the crop to  agriculture,  if it became  successfully established in England, that,  in  my  opinion,the State ought  to support an experimental trial of  the manufacture,.  The difficulty of inducing the  capitalist to  undertake  the whole risk of the experiment is made far  greater at  the present time by our entire uncertainty as to  the  course of the  prices of  sugar in the future, and  as to the oosts of labour. The  capitalist is in this further  difficulty,  that unless he has  a factor?  ready  to utilise the sugar beet he  cannot  make contracts with the  farmer to  grow it.  The farmer,  on  the other hand, will not begin to  grow the crop.until he has an  assured market. Eaoh party feels that  at  the outset he is at the meroy of the ether as  to price,          X  am  of opinion that the scheme as proposed affords a more  satisfactory  working basis than any other  likely  to bo  proposed.  The Kelhsm estate has been very well bought,  is entirely suited to  the purpose and is in itself a considerable asset to  the credit of  the enterprise.  It may be possible to insist upon somewhat more  favourable terms as regards the State loan in ;bhe proposed agreement,  but I  support that agreement as providing  a not unfair  basis  of joityfc  aotion between the public  and  the State.  Though  the  State are  debarred from anything more than a  bare interest  on their loan, the  public will have to provide capital at risk and oannot  receive more  than a *7ar loan rate of interest during the experimental period,  though they would obtain all the benefits  of the  enterprise should  it  prove successful.R.E.
