INTERIM REPORT BY BRITISH DELEGATE.MY LORD,                                           Paris, January 17, 1919.    The  Report, submitted herewith,  which has necessarily been prepared undercircumstances of great pressure, sets out;       I. The  action taken by the Inter-Allied Commission to deal with the immediate          needs of German Austria. -     II. The  salient economic facts as to  the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and          its urgent difficulties, as presented to the Commission  in  the course  of          their enquiries.    III. Recommendations for future action.    Though  the Report is made by myself alone (the other representatives will, Iunderstand, also make individual reports to their Governments), there will, I think, befound to be little substantial difference between our views.    No attempt is made, in this Report, to give  a definite statistical  review of thesituation.  Neither the  time nor the staff have  sufficed for the  preparation of this.I have a mass of statistical material which can be worked up later. There are alsoa number of important  papers  (particularly  those dealing with  German-Austrianfinance) of which only single copies  were furnished.  Dr. Taylor has the originals, andis arranging to  have copies made and supplied to  the other delegates immediately.     I give in an Appendix a list of the  members of the Commission, with a time-table of its journeys and a table of rations in  Vienna, Prag, and Buda-Pesth.                                     I have the honour to be,                                          My Lord,                                              Your obedient Servant,                                         (Signed)    W. H. BEVERIDGE. To the Right Honourable     The Earl of Reading, G.C.B.                                 REPORT.            I. PROVISION FOR  IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF GERMAN AUSTRIA.    Provision for the immediate needs of German Austria, in respect of cereals and fats, has been made by the decision of the Commission of  8th January, as set out below :               Inter-Allied Commission on Relief in German Austria.    Resolution for additional emergency supply.          The information collected by the Inter-Allied Commission up to the present.      indicates:           (1) That the surplus of cereals now in sight for German Austria (including                the 4,000 tons of wheat which  are being sent under the Resolution                of 27th December 1918) will be&apos; exhausted at or about 20th January.          (2) That the difficulties in the way of obtaining supplies from neighbouring                countries are such as to make it impossible to count on such supplies                with certainty as a means of meeting immediate needs.          In view of the imperative necessity of avoiding any actual interruption  in      the supply of cereals to  Vienna and other  districts of German Austria, it is      resolved that, in addition to the 4,000 tons already being sent, another 20,000-      of wheat or  other cereals, 2,000 tons of  fats, and 750 tons of condensed milk    A (35)7383-2  Pk 9 150  2/19 EfcS                                          A
      should he sent forthwith from Italy or from stocks  on ships, on the following      terms:           (a) Of the total of 24,000 tons, one-third shall  he horne on the allocation                 of Italy, France, and the United Kingdom respectively.  The 2,000                 tons of fats and 750  tons of  condensed  milk shall be similarly                 divided.          (6) The  whole supply shall be secured bv increasing the present deposit of                 18,000,000 kronen to 150,000,000* kronen, to be  held by the Italian                 Military Commandant at Innsbruck for  the three Allies mentioned                 above in equal shares.          (c) The  supply shall be divided between the different districts  of German                 Austria as may be determined by the Commission.          (d) The  supply will  be made in the first  instance from Italian  stocks,                 except in so far as by special arrangement use is made of stocks in                 Italy or on  ships in southern  ports owned by other Governments.                 The Commission will appoint a sub-committee to remain at  Vienna                 after the  return  of the Commission to  Paris, and to carry through                 the detailed work of arranging for supply and distribution.          It is estimated that with the additional supply  the needs will  be  covered      up to about 8th February.          This arrangement is provisional, and will be cancelled or revised  so soon      as regular arrangements  are  made  by the  Associated  Governments or the      Commission for dealing with the financial questions involved in the relief of      German Austria.          It is understood that when the American representatives are  in  a position      to undertake  participation in the above shipment they shall carry such share or      may add  to  it as may be  determined by the Commission.  In the  absence      of ability to  participate at the present moment, the American representatives      interpose no  objection to the stated plan, but call attention to the legal fact that      these stocks cannot, be replaced by the Entente through purchase by loan from      the United States Treasury.         Vienna, January 8, 1919.    Though it became evident at the outset of the Commission^ work that supplies offood must be furnished to German Austria at  once in order to prevent actual acutestarvation, and though with the assent of the  other delegates a preliminary supply of4,000 tons was  ordered  up by  the Italian delegates on  27th December, it  was notpossible  to agree on the decision  set out above till just  before the  Commission^return from Austria.  The  importance which  the American representatives were, by treasury rules,  compelled to attach  to  financial conditions and  to the attempt toobtain immediate payment for supplies, and the desire of the other delegates to avoid,if possible, any action in which the- American representatives could  not  fully share,led to a postponement  of action  till the last possible moment.   It will be seen that even now the food is supplied  on  account of the  three European Allies alone, thoughthe possibility of subsequent American participation is contemplated.    The supplies now authorised, with those available in German Austria itself, will cover requirements up to about 15th February (in place of 8th February as stated inthe resolution).  There may, indeed, be some difficulty (in view of the late decision andof transport delays) in getting the  first  supplies up  in time to avoid  an immediatedeficiency.   I hoped that we should have been able^to leave behind  in Vienna someofficer familiar with food administration and with the  deliberations of the Commission,to guarantee  the effective  execution  of  our work.   As it is, the best possible&apos; has, Ithink, been done with the means available :     (a) By sending Major Bethel 1 (now  in charge  of the British Military Mission in           Vienna), together with representatives of the Italian Military Mission, down           to Lai bach to secure the  opening of  the  Trieste -Vienna route across           Jugo-Slavia.  This has, I  hope, been successfully accomplished.     (b) By  leaving  in  Vienna  an  executive  sub-committee.  Major Bethell will           probably be the most active member  of this sub-committee.  I asked him.           to regard himself as directly  responsible, so far as the British Government           is concerned, for seeing that the supplies arrived in time, and to take every           necessary step  for the purpose,  with  the assurance that it would be           subsequently ratified.
    I should add that a train of food supplies, sent hy the British Commander-in-Ohiefin Italy for the relief of Vienna (presumably as the result of a report made to him by colonel Summerhays and Major Bethell), arrived in Vienna yesterday (accompanied by120  British  soldiers),  and  that  a  second train is promised.  These supplies  areadditional to those recommended  by the Commission, but will be  distributed under-Major BethelTs directions ; co-ordination will thus be secured.    It will  be necessary to come to a decision  by 1st February at  latest,  and ifpossible before, as to supplies of food for German Austria after .15th February.    It will also be necessary to make some financial,arrangement whereby GermanAustria can  pay for the supplies received.   This will undoubtedly be a matter of thegreatest possible difficulty.   It  is  not dealt with at all in  the present report because,as-stated, I have not yet received  copies of the necessary financial documents.  I will submit a separate note  on the subject later.               II. SALIENT ECONOMIC FACTS  IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    The direct mandate of the Commission was to provide for the immediate needs of vienna.  They had no  hesitation in coining to the conclusion that relief was urgently required, in the light of the  information furnished  as to supplies, rations, deaths, anddisease, of their personal inspection of markets, public kitchens, &amp;c , and of examinationof unofficial informants.    It appeared  possible in the discussions  at Berne that the necessary relief for german  Austria  could be  obtained  most easily  and  rapidly by drawing on the neighbouring countries of Czecho-Slovakia and Hungary, and the  original  object ofthe Commission in visiting Prag and  Buda-Pesth was to investigate this possibility.The result  was  to show that each  of  these countries  was itself threatened withexhaustion of supplies  at an early date, and each made a demand for imports of cereals and  fats.   The  Czechs asked for  supplies to be sent immediately,  and put  theirdeficiency of cereals up  to  the  next  harvest  at  450,000 tons;   this figure seemsimpossibly high,  and  the  Commission incline to the view that 250,000 tons is themaximum that can be  required.  The Hungarians put  their deficiency of cereals inthe parts of Hungary  not occupied  by the various Allies at 150,000 tons, and theirdate for exhaustion of present stocks as the end of April.  The deficiency in GermanAustria is probably in  the neighbourhood  of 400,000 tons.  Taking the  lower figure for Czecho-Slovakia, the total deficiency of cereals up to the next harvest in the three countries under review may be put  provisionally at 800,000 tons ; that is to  say, thisis the quantity which must be imported either from overseas  or from other parts ofEurope.   In addition,  there is a very serious deficiency in each  country of fats, milk,and meat; the only prospective surplus is that of sugar in Czecho-Slovakia, which isone of the principal sugar-producing districts of the world.     The visits of the  Commission  to Prag and to  Bada-Pesth,  however, did muchmore than merely show an immediate or prospective  deficiency of food in  those places as well as in Vienna.   They confirmed completely the impression received at Viennathat the question of food cannot be  treated  apart from other questions, and that theshortage of  food is little more than  a symptom of a social and economic disintegration,so- complete and so strange as to make adequate description almost impossible.  Here,at least, nothing more  can be attempted than to set out a few of the salient facts.             A. The Desperate Position of Vienna and German Austria.     Vienna, with its two-and-a-quarter million inhabitants, from being the  capital ofan Empire has become tne chief town of a State which outside it numbers  less than six million inhabitants; it is an enormous head on the body of a dwarf.  The territory of German Austria, moreover, even apart  from  questions of size,  is singularly littlequalified to support a large capital; it contains only relatively small industrial diotricts(chiefly in Styria and the neighbourhood  of Vienna) ;  even of the rural  areas  largeportions are mountainous and relatively unproductive (Tirol, Vorarlberg, Salzburg, &amp;c).The part of Austria now claimed  by the Czechs, while it contains only about one-thirdof the total  population of Austria,  accounts for 90 per cent, of the coal production,80 per cent, of the iron and steel, 90 per cent, of the cotton, 95 per cent, of the sugar,and practically all the wool and ceramic trades.     The principal industry of  Vienna was the manufacture of clothing and ornaments.Its importance lay in its position  as a centre of government, culture, finance, commerce,and  transport.   For  none of  these services to be rendered by  Vienna is there atpresent any demand.   It  is  not  clear to  what extent  the  world  will have a use for                                                                          A 2
Vienna in the future.   Even assuming that the Associated Governments are prepareddirectly or indirectly to grant  a  loan  to German  Austria (which appears no lessnecessary as a means of enabling it to start trade with its neighbours than as a meansof obtaining imported food), it is quite an open question whether any adequate security for the loan is available, either under the heading of present properties or under thatof prospective earnings.  German  Austria is a bankrupt with no assurance of  everbeing able to earn money again.     At any rate the most hopeful  outlook  for Vienna (and so for its creditors) lies in restoring  its  importance as a transport and trading centre ; this in  turn probablydepends upon restoring as much as possible of the previous economic unity of Austria-Hungary, despite its  political  dismemberment.   A  movement for  an  &quot; EconomicConfederation of the Danube,&quot; which would also be for German Austria a movementaway from Germany, may thus be  both financially and  politically desirable from thepoint of view of the principal Allies ; whether the feeling between the different Statesthat must compose  the confederation is  such as to  allow of its being realised in any reasonable period of time is another question.     Meanwhile  a tendency for still  further dismemberment is showing itself in the shape  of movements in  the Vorarlberg,  the  Tirol, and  other parts of German Austriato set  up separate  Governments and to cut themselves free  from the  incubus of vienna.                   B. The Breaking Off of Economic Relations.     The  dismemberment of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire  and the  occupation ofvarious parts of it by allied military forces, as carried out at the moment, are producingan economic chaos.   Territories which were  formerly part of a  single economic whole,depending upon one another for  essential commodities,  are now separated by politicalboundaries or by military lines of occupation, which in each case tend  to becomeeconomic  barriers.  The immediate  cause of the German  Austrian food  crisis, forinstance, lies in the loss of supplies from Bohemia and from Hungary.  The Czechs,being  no longer compelled to feed  German Austria,  very  naturally raised  theirrations.   They were clearly entitled  to do  this, since their former rations were whollyinadequate, but the position of German Austria was at once made desperate.   Hungary,again,  which used to feed  Austria,  now finds most of her fat and an important part ofher  cereals cut off through  the occupation of Southern Hungary by the Serbians;according to the Hungarian officials there is  an immense surplus of maize  and of fatpigs in the occupied provinces, which cannot be got to Buda-Pesth because the militaryline of occupation  is treated  as an economic barrier.   Again, while  Buda-Pesth  isalready very short  of  milk (the supply  being now  40,000  litres a day as against400,000),  it is stated that a further reduction of 6,000 litres was made a few days agosimply through the action of the Czechs in occupying a sugar factory to which a largemilk-producing establishment is attached.     Another striking instance of the breaking of  connections  was given by M. Kunfi,the Hungarian Minister for Public  Welfare.   He stated that a number of Hungariansoldiers,  having lost limbs in the war, had been sent to Buda-Pesth to get measuredfor artificial limbs and then had returned to their homes  to wait  for the  limbs to bemade  and sent to them.  The artificial limbs were now  ready and waiting at Buda-Pesth, but as the owners in many  cases were living within the  Serbian  or  Roumaniansphere of occupation, they could not receive the limbs.   The legless and handless menwere on one  side of the military line and the artificial limbs were on the other side.     Apart from such extreme cases, however (which may  not be typical), it is clearthat the setting up of so many separate States each of which, in its uncertainty as to&apos; the political  future, uses  every  opportunity of bargaining  with its neighbours---prevents  the formation of ordinary economic relations ; or if such are formed they are constantly liable to interruption through misunderstandings and  trivial disputes.     The  Jugo-Slavs, for instance,  at a recent conference on the opening of the Trieste railway for traffic to Vienna, refused at first, on  the ground  that the Viennese were holding up supplies of salt and sugar for them.   In each of  these cases enquiries by the independent British representative  present showed  that  there  was a simple misunderstanding which was at once adjusted; but for the presence  of the represen- tative, however, the misunderstanding  might easily have continued and the railway have been blocked.     The  Czechs gave as another instance  that the renewed operation of a number ofcoal mines was being blocked because all  the working plans  were in Vienna and theViennese would not part with them.
    Again, at the moment, the Czechs could find  coal for more locomotives if theyhad them,  and are asking  to have locomotives lent to them by the  Entente fromthe number which Germany has to surrender ;  at the same time German Austria and hungary have  more  locomotives  and waggons than  they can use,  because theyhave no coal.    It is quite clear  that the successful revictualling  of all these territories will depend on the re-establishment of readiness pf  the various districts to deal freely with one another irrespective of political claims and temporary misunderstandings.  It willnot, however, be sufficient merely  to get this  accqpted as  a general principle.  for practical purposes it seems essential to have something in the nature of an. independent(i.e., Inter-Allied) Commission to deal with the continual small disputes that are boundto  arise.                       C. The Lack of Goal  and  Transport.    All the three countries visited by the Commission (German Austria, Hungary,Czecho-Slovakia)  are  being  paralysed by want  of  coal and  by breakdown oftransport (Avhich  is in part a consequence of the  coal famine  and is in  part dueto  independent causes such as deficiency and disrepair of rolling-stock).   Viennais  subject  to the  most drastic restrictions on heating, light, transport, and  manu-facture, but even with these  restrictions is consuming more coal  than it  can  nowobtain daily from Czeclio-Slovakia  and  elsewhere.   According  to  the  estimates of the  American  officers, who made  a special investigation of the coal  question,Vienna was expected to exhaust all reserves of coal by the end of January.  Hungaryis  in some respects worse off  for coal  even than German Austria, through the cutting off of imports and the occupation by Serbians, Roumanians, and Czechs of its mostimportant mining districts.  The  supplies  available for the area still retained underHungarian administration are equal only to half the drastically reduced requirements ;the manufacture of gas in Buda-Pesth has had  to be discontinued; the railway service is  reduced  to one train a day each way on main lines, one train every third day onbranch lines, and no trains at all in one large district (Debrezen).     The Czechs  should have  plenty of coal, but say  that  in fact  they can  onlyprovide the inadequate supplies now being sent to Vienna at the  expense of urgent rquirements of their own.   They are  faced with a falling production owing  to the spread of Bolshevism and strikes, and (as a special  cause) owing to the  occupation byPoles of a number of mines in Eastern Silesia (Ostrau-Karvin).     When asked what steps could be taken  to increase  the  production of coal the czech authorities gave the following measures in the following order :      (i) The occupation by the Allied military force of the mines  in Eastern Silesia,           and also the sending of   some Allied  troops to the principal Bohemian           mining districts (Kladno) as a means of combating Bolshevism.    (ii) The supply of wire cables and other  materials of  machinery with which the           coal mines were now insufficiently provided.   (iii) The provision of sufficient food and clothes for  the miners.     The consideration of the  coal problem, as  of unemployment, leads directly to thetopic of Bolshevism.                               1). Unemployment.     The problem of unemployment, particularly in Vienna and Buda-Pesth, is reachingportentous proportions..  It only escapes notice at  the moment through preoccupationwith  more urgent questions  and  through ihe  extravagant  provision of  relief.  it represents, however, a source of immense social danger for the near future.     The man-power of German Austria and Hungary has been engaged for four years &apos;in the production of war ; it is now, at least in  the towns, producing practically nothingat all.  The armies are demobilised; the munition works are stopped.   The shortageof coal and transport  and  the maintenance of the blockade make the resumptionof ordinary industrial activity on any large scale impossible.  The workmen are being maintained in idleness by unemployment relief.  In Vienna all  unemployed workmenare receiving 60 per cent, of their previous pay plus an allowance for dependants. InBuda-Pesth men are receiving 14 kronen and  women 10 kronen a day, figures which,even at the reduced value of the krone, are very high in relation to previous earnings.The Governments find the means to make these payments by continual recourse to the printing of more paper money.     It is unnecessary to elaborate  the evils of such a situation, and the certainty ofdemoralisation, disorder and bankruptcy involved in its continuance for any considerable     A 7383-2                                                             A3
period.   There has not as yet been any public disorder in Vienna (where the people are dulled by slow starvation and patient by nature), but there has  been  occasionallooting  in Prag and Buda-Pesth, and the development of rioting, if nothing is done toprovide real employment as Avell as food, is only a question of time.                      E. Fear of Bolshevism and Disorder.     Wherever the Commission went-but particularly in Prag and Buda-Pesth-they found a constantly repeated expression of fear of Bolshevism arising, both out of the hardships to which the workmen Avere being subjected and as the result of agitationfostered from Russia.     The expression of the fear was generally followed by a request for the presence ofAllied troops.  M. Kramarsch (whom we  interviewed on the day  before he was shotat) was  extremely emphatic in his fear, and  President  Masaryk was also prepared to welcome such intervention.   Buda-Pesth,  at the time of our visit, was in the throes ofa political crisis, and  though the issue there did not concern the Bolshevists properlySO&apos; called (but was  an issue between the bourgeois and the social  democratic parties)the spectre of Bolshevism was always present to the minds, of  everybody.  The onlypublicly armed force in Plungary now is entirely in the hands of the Social Democrats,and quite  undisciplined.   The Minister of  War, M. Festetics,  told me that  he veryseldom issued an order now, because every order issued by him was submitted by thesoldiers to  a Soldiers&apos; Council to  consider whether or not they would obey it.   At any moment there is fear that the extremer Social Democrats may become Bolshevists, orthe soldiers themselves may go over to a party of robbery and violence.  There seems,indeed,  little  doubt that if Buda-Pesth is left to itself it will sooner or later explode,and the only difference of opinion that I have heard is as to whether the explosion was likely to take place in a few days or in a few weeks..     I recognise that the remedy of military occupation is not  one that  should belightly adopted, but it is difficult to feel any security without it.     I am inclined to  suggest for cpnsideration that at any rate an appreciable force ofEntente troops (say 5,000 or  10,000) should, by agreement with  the Czechs, be sentto Czecho-Slovakia, which may be regarded  as. an  island, of Allied feeling and. com-parative stability surrounded on all sides  by disorganisation  and  threats of disorder.Troops using Czecho-Slovakia as a base would  be able to deal rapidly with disorder in the neighbouring  districts  (Eastern Silesia,  Buda-Pesth, Galioia),. and a smallstiffening of Entente troops would enable  the Czech troops themselves to be emplyed to a considerable extent by increasing their prestige.     Any permanent safeguard against disorder must clearly be sought, not in military occupation, but in the  restoration of  economic security;  that  is to say,  in  theimmediate  provision of the minimum of food, clothing, and fuel,  and in the resumptionat as: early  a date as possible of ordinary industrial activity.                     III. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION..     The cessation of war without the  restoration of peace  in Austria-Hungary^combined with its political  dismemberment,  has produced a state of general economicparalysis.  It seems  difficult  to  avoid  the  conclusion that, in order to  prevent  a collapse of  the social order comparable to  what  has  occurred in Russia,  the  Alliesmust practically, if not formally, treat the war with all parts of Austria as finished,and must give positive help in reconstruction there.  The reason for this is not thatthe Hungarians or  G-erman Austrians deserve special consideration, or have  a claimto avoid suffering  as Northern France and Belgium suffered.  The real  grounds aretwofold:      (i) The war  is  in  fact  so  completely finished, as far as these countries * are           concerned, and they are so completely smashed,, that war-time standards           of inhumanity are no longer applicable.  .    (ii)  The further spread of disorder in  Europe is  a  danger to  the Allied countries           themselves.     A third  ground  was advanced  by  representative  men,  both in  German austria and in Hungary.  In each  case  they  stated that  if  they were left alone and  onunfriendly  terms with their  immediate  neighbours (Czecho-Slovakia.  Jugo-Slavia,Roumania) since  it  was impossible  for  them  to  stand  alone with their reducedterritories  and economic impoverishment they  would be  bound to fall into close relations with Germany, which would thus get  a material  accession of strength.  If,on the other hand,  German Austria and Hungary could enter on reasonable  terms into
a close economic relation with their neighbouring States-an &quot;Economic Confederation&apos;of the Danube &quot;-the whole might form a group of  connected States  too  clearly&apos;differentiated in character ever to join Q-ermany as a whole,yet with sufficient internal&apos;cohesion to prevent any one member of the  group breaking off to  join Germanyalone.   A permanent equipoise would be produced in the south to German power inthe north.     This argument touches the fringe of very large and much debated questions, andI only give it for what it is worth.  In the mouths of most of those  who  used itit was certainly not a threat, hut an expression of their own desires.   The making,in effect if not in form, of an earlier economic peace in the whole of Austro-Hungary,and thus leaving Germany alone to the last,  would be  a  simple continuance of  the strategy which terminated the war, by a  succession of armistices  at different dates.     Assuming, however, that, whether  with  this  in  view   or  not,  the Associated Governments are prepared to treat the war as ended so far as is  necessary to  prevent both extreme privation and disorder, the following programme of action is suggested.                              PROPOSALS FOR ACTION. A. General.     1. Two general principles should be accepted  and publicly announced by the Associated Governments  of France, Italy,  the  United Kingdom, and the  United States irrespective of  the peace negotiations, viz.:      (a) That all the territories formerly part  of the Austro-Hungarian Empire should            be enabled  and assisted to  obtain the indispensable minimum  supplies            of food, fuel, and other primary commodities up to the next harvest.     (b) That without  prejudice to political  claims  there  should be  an immediate            resumption of supply and interchange of  such  commodities between all            those territories, irrespective of any lines of military occupation under the            armistice.  !   &apos; 2. The application of the  first principle will be  conditional upon the  existence  in  the  territory  concerned of  a   Government  sufficiently  stable  to  guarantee the  execution of any conditions laid down by the Associated Governments as to  payment  for and distribution of the supplies.      3.  The  application of the second principle will be subject to the right of  each  Government to retain within the territories for whose  administration it  is responsible  such supplies as are necessary for the support of the population  there.      4. An Economic Commission should be appointed by the Associated Governments  charged with  the  duty of securing  the  practical application of the two principles  named above, under the  direction of those Governments.   The Commission should  have headquarters, with a staff and offices, at  one of the capitals concerned,  with  branches  in the other  principal  centres.   Its  special functions would include the  following:       (a) Determination, in consultation  with  the Governments concerned,  of the             requirements  of  the  various   territories for   food, fuel,  and  primary             commodities and of the means for meeting these  requirements.        .  :       (b) Dealing with any difficulties or disputes arising as to the interchange of  these              commodities between different territories.       (c) Making the  necessary local  arrangements for &apos; import of  supplies  required              from overseas, and for inland transport.       (d)  Execution of financial arrangements made to  secure payment for supplies.       (e), Assisting, so far as necessary, Allied Governments within its area to obtain              supplies of raw material and other commodites, which, though not primary              commodities in the sense  described  below,  are required to enable their              industries to be developed.       5. While the Commission will deal with both  Allied and enemy Governments  within its area, a distinction will naturally be made between the two, at least until the  Allies are prepared completely to raise the blockade for  all  these territories.  The  former, besides being directly  supplied with food and other essential  articles, will be  enabled and assisted to obtain, either officially or by  opening the ordinary channels of  trade, all  such raw materials as are necessary to  secure rapid reconstruction  and
development of their industries.   The latter will obtain  only &quot;primary commodities,&quot;i.e., commodities deemed to be indispensable in order to preserve life and public order,and  will obtain them only under strict control.  The term &quot; primary commodities &quot;will  be defined by the Commission under the directions of the Associated Governments.It may clearly include, besides food and  fuel, clothing (so far as this is necessary toenable indispensable work to be done), wire rope and  other material for mines, oil,copper, &amp;c, to restore transportation facilities.  The definition of primary commoditieswill  naturally be varied from time to time according to circumstances; in particular itwill  vary according to the degree to which the Associated Governments are preparedto assist late  enemy countries to prevent unemployment and the consequent  risk of disorder.   In this way the blockade of German Austria and of Hungary  could beraised gradually and by a strictly controlled process.     6. The Commission will not deal with permanent political issues, its whole purposebeing to secure prompt action on urgent economic difficulties which cannot wait forthe solution of the  larger problems by the Peace Conference, but it should clearly bekept in close touch with political questions.  Probably a political  officer or  officers should be attached to it  for liaison purposes.  The working of the Commission will,of course,  involve  the  recognition  of  provisional &quot; Governments,&quot; or at least of administrative authorities for each of the districts dealt with, and the laying downaccordingly  of  definite  administrative boundaries.  This  can and must  be  doneexpressly without prejudice to the ultimate settlement of political claims.     7. The Commission  should deal with German Austria, Hungary, Czecho-Slovakia,Jugo-Slavia and  Serbia, and Roumania.  It probably  should  not  deal directly withGalioia and Poland ; though parts of these  territories were  formerly included in the austro-Hungarian Empire their present orientation is towards Russia.  The questionof precise spheres of action is, however, a matter for further consideration.     8. Unless the domestic objections to military occupation of any of the territories in question are deemed to be insuperable, a certain force of Entente troops should be concentrated in Czecho-Slovakia  as  a  base, and  sent out from  there as required tosupport the work of the Commission.B. Special.     9. Goal. The increase of the coal supply of all the districts in  question must beregarded  as the most  urgent  of  all  the  problems   to  be solved.   The  meansavailable are :        (a) Supply of materials and machinery to  the mines.       (6) Supply of food and clothing to the miners.       (c)  Suppression of disorder, if necessary by a display of military force.       (d) Supply of additional labour, if necessary that of prisoners.     10. Finance. German  Austria must  be placed in a position  both to  purchasefood from abroad and to treat with its neighbours (if  necessary by  paying for rawmaterials  to be supplied to them from abroad)  in exchange for other food  products(such as sugar in the case of Czecho-Slovakia).   The financial problems of  hungary and  of Czecho-Slovakia will  also  need to be  dealt with, but have not  yet  been sufficiently examined.     11. Food Imports. A very rough estimate has been given above that  GermanAustria, Czecho-Slovakia, and Hungary (excluding the occupied portions) will need toreceive from outside something like 800,000 tons of cereals before the end of August.It&apos;is impossible  to say bow much of this will  need to come as import from overseasuntil it is known how much can be obtained from neighbouring countries, in particular the  Ukraine  and Southern Hungary.   There is  said to be a surplus of grain in theUkraine, but there are two difficulties in utilising the surplus one, that the Poles andthe Ukrainians are fighting on the main line of railway by which the corn could  cometo Austria, and the  other that the Ukrainians are said not to be prepared to  sell cornfor gold or any other form of money, but only to  barter it for useful commodities, suchas clothes.  The more completely these two difficulties can be surmounted  the lesswill  be the need for overseas  imports.  No final programme can  be made  at themoment, but an import running into some hundreds of thousands of  tons of food aloneseems  indispensable, and a provisional programme for  immediate action could  beprepared after brief further enquiry.

Mr. Loree (did not proceed beyond Berne).        France.            M. Haguenin.         Italy.            Signor Labriola (remained at Berne).    United Kingdom.In addition,  Mr.  Picart and  other  members of the American  Legation staff  at  Berne,  and  Mr. R. L. Craigie, of the British Legation, assisted in the work there.    The Commission, most of  whose members left Paris on Sunday night, the 22ud December 1918, metfor the first time at Berne on Tuesday, the 24th, and on the same day began discussions with representativesof G-erman Austria and Vienna, who had been at Berne for some time.  Daily conferences were held till the following Monday,  On Tuesday, the 31st December, the Commission left Berne  for Vienna, arrivingthere on Thursday afternoon, the 2nd January. On Sunday night, the 5th January, they travelled to Prag,spent  nearly two full days  there, and&apos; travelled back to Vienna on Tuesday night, the 7th January, arrivingon the 8th January.  The arrangements for temporary relief of  German Austria were practically completed on the same day, and at night the  Commission left for Buda-Pesth, spent there nearly two whole days (asat Prag), and returning on Friday night, reached Vienna on Saturday.  Four  members of the Commission(Dr.  Taylor, the  two French delegates, and myself)  left Vienna  on the following day (Sunday,  the12tli January) for Paris, which we reached  on  the  15th  January.   The principal Italian  representative,Signor GiutfHda, unfortunately fell  ill at Prag,  and had to be left behind there.   He  was, however,nearly well again at  the  time of  our departure from Vienna.  Signor Oblieght waited at Vienna for his return.    Captain Gregory and Mr. Gibson have gone on to Trieste, Agram, and  Belgrade with a view to testingthe Hungarian statements as  to food supplies in ihe occupied portions of Southern  Hungary.  A Sub-Committee  has been left by  the  Commission at  Vienna  to carry through the detailed arrangements forsecuring that the  promised supplies arrive and are distributed.     12, Other Imports. There  are  urgent  requirements  for a  certain quantity ofclothes, hospital  material,  and  some  of  the  indispensable materials of  industry.Requirements for raw materials have been obtained, and are being examined.   Theywill certainly outrun  both the probable supply and the means of inland transport.     13. Inland  Transport. While it  is impossible to  estimate  at  the moment  thetotal quantity of  overseas imports  that will  be required, it is  pretty certain that theavailable means of inland transport from  the  south will not  be sufficient to provideeven for the minimum requirements of food, clothing, and primary commodities, andwill fall altogether  short of allowing any import of  ordinary raw materials or feeding-stuffs.   The  possibility  of meeting the requirements  of  the  Czechs  in these  tworespects depends  on the  possibility of  opening the  Elbe to navigation.   The plan should be adopted if  at all possible.  An alternative-of opening up  the left bank  ofthe River Rhine-is probably less satisfactory.

The foregoing table gives the rations at present in force in Vienna, Buda-Pesth, and Prag respectively.    It will  be seen that the  Viennese are markedly worse off than either  of  the  other two, though tillrecently Prag had much the same rations as Vienna.    The independence of Czecho-Slovakia has been signalised by  a  very large increase of  the rations of flour and of  sugar, but these can certainly not even now be regarded as excessive.    The investigation has clearly shown that Austria has been slowly starving for eighteen  mouths or so.Its leaders made the mistake of conducting  the war on the military front alone, and forgot the  borne front.    The Viennese  rationing  system  is very complete in so far as  cards and registration of customers isconcerned.   Unfortunately a  very  large proportion of such  food as  is available is not distributed throughthe rationing system, but  becomes  the subject of contraband trade,  and is bought  by the rich secretly atextravagant prices.   The  German Austrians, in fact, appear totally  to  have  failed to solve the problem of bringing under control their home produce.    It was not easy to get a clear  idea of  the Prag rationing system (since the Czecb officials  are in manycases  somewhat new to their work), but it is  probably not mucb more efficient than the Viennese system inlespect of bringing food under control,  and  is less complete in respect of rationing and registration.APPENDIX  B.
