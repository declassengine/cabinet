29th January, 1919.



To the Members of the War Cabinet,

Gentlemen,

       I have the honour to convey to you, in the name of the above Committee, the accompanying Resolution which was passed at a largely attended Meeting this afternoon.

Yours faithfully,

(Signed) SIMPSON JOHNSON

RESOLUTION.

The Temperance and Social Welfare Committee of the Wesleyan Methodist Church views with consternation the Ministry of Food&apos;s recommendation in favour of an increase in the output of beer and protests against the action of the Food Committee in issuing a general licence authorising the purchase of barley by every person holding a licence under the Finance Act 1909-10 as a distiller of spirits, free from the restrictions contained in the Cereal (Restrictions) Order 1918; as the effect of such licence to distilling will be to replenish the stocks of raw spirits to remain in bond to mature. On ethical and humans grounds this Committee deplores such ? in view of the terrible shortage of food and the threatened famine in Central and Eastern Europe before the next harvest; and on economic grounds in view of the action of the United States in favour of prohibition and the consequent greater industrial efficiency with which this country will be faced in competition with America; and on the ground of the ? to public order during the period of demobilisation.
