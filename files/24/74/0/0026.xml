Memorandum by the Postmaster-General.I-.    The continuance of the censorship of telegrams and lettersmust &quot;bo decided on grounds of opioiaeroial policy; but there arecertain important considerations in favour of its early relaxationox abolition to which I desire to draw attention.8,Censorship necessarily means.delay to.all telegrams and letters censored.  During the war, owing- tQ the existence of other factors, such as:the congestion:.Q  traffic on tho cables, thoirregular sailing of mail ships,  etc., the censorship delay hasnot been very material;,  but,- with the. return&apos; of. normal conditions^it is already provoking groat complaint, especially as regardstelegrams,3odureBesides the actual delay involved in the censorship proce-the censorship restrictions cause delay fey increasing theamount of traffic on the cables.  The use of codes is prohibited^except as regards a few public codes which have been speciallyauthorised, . Messages in these codes have to be decoded after beinghanded .in,.which In itself means, delay and considerable expense *4,    The private codes which were largely used by the commercialcommunity before the.war are -entirely prohibited. &apos; The cablingpublic are pressing for their re-introduction; and the EasternTelegraph Company, whose&apos; routes  (serving practically the whole empire except Canada anu-the West Indies) are at present seriouslycongested, think that if such codos&apos;were:again&apos;allowed, iheirtraffic would be reduced by SO per.cent; or. say- about 25,000 wordsa day.  This-would mean a material relief, and&apos;would,appreciablyreduce delay.  It would also very considerably reduce the cost  ofcabling,5.    The delays on telegrams to India and the East are anythingfrom 4 to 7 days,- and large numbers of messages have to be sentover part of the distance by post..  Sftme relief may be afforded by the repair of broken cables,  but so long - as the prohibitionof private codes continues, I fear a reasonably efficient service will be impossible, as the cables cannot carry the traffic  Our,&quot;:trade with the East is being seriously hampered by the absence  ofswift communication and I anticipate that the Government will be  &apos;strongly pressed, to relax the censorship when&apos;Parliament meets,6*    Apart from-this consideration,  to be -effective,  censorshipinvolves the continuance of tno  present prohibition on:travelling&quot; -and the conveyance of letters by passengers, which on return to normal&quot;&apos; conditions will be difficult to enforce.  The cost.&quot;Of the censorship staff throughout the&apos;-Empire must also be. considerable.I would therefore urge that the  censorship should be removed atthe earliest possible date that  is consistent with commercialsafetyo(Signed!
