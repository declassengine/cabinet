SECRET.                               .-;  GOVERNMENT                   MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.Eeport for Week  ending Wednesday,  January 22,  1919.                         PART  I.-ACTION  TAKEN..     Mr. G. H. Roberts has returned from Paris.  During his short visit he conferred with the Prime Minister and with the British and Allied Representatives on the Supreme Council of Supply and Relief.                             RATIONING AND  QUEUES.     The  Commissioner  of Police of  the  Metropolis  has  addressed a letter to the Ministry  stating  that  &quot;he views  with great  concern the possibility that,  with the cessation  of the rationing system, the food queues outside shops may recur.     &quot; The Commissioner is satisfied that the old queues were an evil, the importance of which it is difficult to overrate.  They became centres of disaffection owing to tired women working upon each others feelings and so enhancing  the  general sense of grievance felt at the time.  For  this  reason he realises that the service rendered by the  Ministry of  Food  in  introducing  arrangements  whereby the  queues  were automatically abolished was a service of the very first importance.     &quot; The Commissioner trusts  that the Ministry may be  able  to repeat this  service by maintaining the requisite arrangements of distribution and  supply  until  such time as the recurrence of the  queue trouble  will have become a virtual impossibility.&quot;     The Commissioner of Police has been informed that the Food Controller regards the prevention of. queues as of  the highest  importance,  and that it is proposed to maintain the system of registration of customers until supplies are sufficiently plentiful to make it certain that the system might be  abandoned without risk of inequitable- or inadequate distribution of food.     The Food Council. Meetings of the Council  were  held  on Thursday, January 16th, and  Tuesday, January 21st.    The Council  agreed that, with a view to disposing to the trade stocks of Norwegian canned fish held  by the Ministry, the current  maximum price should be  maintained until May 1st, with a possible extension to  July 1st,  and  that  the  embargo  on the importation of Norwegian fish should be retained until May 1st.    It was reported that a considerable  quantity of Army stocks of frozen rabbits would be available for sale,  and that the Board of Trade were proposing to carry out the sale.  It was decided to draw the attention of the Board of Trade to the fact that the Ministry of Food possessed a  complete organisation for  the sale and distribution of this commodity and would be willing to undertake the work.    The price of molasses is to be reduced  to  161. per ton to wholesale dealers and manufacturers, after a month&apos;s notice.  It was agreed that no compensation would bedue from the  Ministry to holders of stocks.    The Board of Agriculture desire the Ministry, in the interests of agriculture, toallow the feeding of game birds with damaged grain.   The Council have accordingly decided to advise the Food Controller to revoke the Feeding of Game Order, 1917.    In view of the abundant supplies of oatmeal it is proposed to revoke the Oatmeal(Restriction) Order which prohibited its use  for other than human food.  . The Council considered the question of  allowing the export, without  licence, ofparcels  of  foodstuffs  valued  up  to 21. to  British  possessions  and  extra-Europeandestinations.  . It was decided  to  inform the  War Trade Department of the objectionsto the export of flour, but that otherwise the  Ministry were prepared to agree.    It was agreed that the Repatriation Officer might  publish the statement  thatBelgians returning to their country are permitted, to take packages of foodstuffs up to12 lbs. including not more than 2 lbs. of coffee.

      Various questions relating. to potatoes were  considered by the Council.   With  regard to claims for abnormal  wastage it was decided  that blight should  not be  considered abnormal wastage, and that the agreed prices were for sound ware potatoes  only.  For the settlement of claims it was decided that a central committee should be  appointed consisting of two representatives of the Ministry, and a representative each  of the Board ol Agriculture, the  Central Agricultural Advisory Council,  the Con-  sumers&apos; Council, and the Finance Division.  The  Zonal Chairman  would adjudicate  on cases within his area but the final decision would rest  with the Committee.   With  regard to the price of  potatoes in Scotland it was  agreed that the Food Controller  could not further increase the price to Scottish growers.      Lord Bleclisloe submitted a memorandum on the question of the revocation of the  Sale of Sweetmeats (Restriction) Order.  It was agreed that the  Order, which limited  the sale of sweetmeats to the smaller  shops might be revoked, assuming the arrange-  ments proposed for distribution sufficiently protected the small businesses.      It was reported that the  Sugar Commission  did not consider  that  it would be  possible to release control of sugar supplies before the autumn. :      . &apos;      The proposal of the Shipping Controller  to release British tonnage from requisi-  tion was considered.  The  suggestion that the  Freight Department of  the Ministry  should open a chartering office in the City which should  make arrangements for the  chartering of tonnage for all foodstuffs was approved by the Council.  Such,  an office  would also be able to co-ordinate  the  chartering of tonnage on  behalf of the Allies.  It was further decided to ask the  Shipping Controller for a formal assurance that  the latter will ensure that  adequate  tonnage shall be available  for  the carriage of  foodstuffs required  by the  Food Controller, and that freights for the carriage of the  Ministry&apos;s purchases shall not exceed the present Government stores rates whether  they are carried by liners or by tramps.     The Imports Board. As the Canadian  Government offer no  objection  to  the re-exportation of bacon supplied from Canada  it  has been decided to ascertain from. the Swedish Trade Office if the Swedish request for 10,000 tons of bacon can be met in part by Canadian supplies.     It was reported that as three ships  assigned  for the March-April  Australasian shipping  programme  were now required by-the  War Office  for demobilisation purposes, 10,000 tons less meat during those two months would  be  shipped, thereby necessitating a transfer of this amount from June to July-arrival.  &apos;   .     It was decided  to  inform- the Treasurythat.no.. credits:, will :.be -required by.the.; Ministry for  purchases of condensed milk  in Canada during January, February, and March, and that it will be possible to refund 1,000,000 dollars to the  Treasury,     The  Board approved  a. proposal  to purchase  an additional 500 to 1,000  tons of butter from the United States..                             *                           .....   i               ,trT.     The Central Agricultural Advisory Council.- A meeting  of the Council was held on Tuesday, January 21st.  The disposal  of the 1918 crop of potatoes-was discussed;, and the officials  of the Ministry were  urged to do everything possible to move the. potatoes quickly, since the producers  were convinced that many potatoes which  were sound wdien put into the clamps were now becoming unsaleable, and the seed  potatoes were wanted for planting.     The serious spread of wart disease in  potatoes was also discussed, and a resolution was passed to the effect &quot; That this Council views with alarm the recent great  increase &quot; in the number  of outbreaks of wart disease among potatoes, and urges the Board of &quot; Agriculture to  adopt at  once the most drastic measures for preventing the use of &quot; seed tubers from infected districts.&quot;  It was suggested  that the inspectors under the Board of Agriculture should take steps to isolate infected areas and prevent seed potatoes from being exported from them.     The desirability of  establishing  standards for  every  description,  of milk  product on the same lines as for butter and milk was discussed, but it was  decided to postpone this question until the policy of the Government with regard to milk control should be settled.                                                                         i     The  Consumers&apos; Council. - The  Council  met  on   Tuesday,  January 21st.Mr. Hyndman moved the following resolution:            &quot;In view of the probable continuance for some time of the existing short-..   -   age of ineat, and the  exceptionally  large quantities of fish now to be caught in      the  North Sea-owing to the  suspension of  fishing over a very wide area for      more than four years-which to a great extent would make up for. the lack of
       meat, the Government ought/immediately to  release and lit up for the fishery       service the 3,000 steam trawlers at the disposal of the Admiralty, and encourage       the building and equipment of more ; that steps  be  taken forthwith to improve       the quays and harbours  (as well  as the facilities of railway transport  in the       shape of cars fitted with chilling  appararus, &amp;c.) so as to be ready to cope with       the  increased  supply;  that the whole department of  fisheries  should be.    &apos;   reorganised, centrally and locally, by the State in consonance with the demand       of every branch of the fishing industry; and that in order to ensure prompt       and effective improvements in the management of this  crucially important       business, a  Minister should be appointed to  control the  entire development in       the national interest.&quot;    The resolution was passed by the Council.                         DEMOBILISATION OF PIVOTAL MEN.    With regard to demobilisation of pivotal  men  in  food  trades it has now beenarranged that the Ministry shall  receive a total allocation of 9,000 men, the officialforms to be finally completed and placed in the hands of the Demobilisation Departmentby Monday next the 27th instant.-V---&quot; &quot;V,-  -        -;     .....SUPPLIES AND  DISTRIBUTION.&apos; &quot; -*    Bacon. Imports  are still in excess of  requirements, and the stocks in the handsof the Ministry are accumulating.  The Army requirements are still on a reducedbasis.    Cheese. It is hoped that ample supplies of cheese will be available after themonth of April.    Cocoa.--Shipmenfcs and arrivals of raw cocoa continue  to be very satisfactory.  Ameeting of the Cocoa Advisory Committee was held yesterday when it was decided toallow importers to export 25 per cent, of  their imports, and to raise the quantity ofcocoa powder at present allowed to be exported from 100 to 300 tons.    Dried Fruits. The Ministry of Shipping have provided freight for 18,000 tonsof currants which  are  reported to be leaving,  or have  left, Greece.  This quantity ofcurrants will be sufficient to make a distribution, and it is anticipated that a reductionwill  be made in the retail prices.in the near future.  Three steamers, the &quot; Caterino,&quot;the &apos;  Moora,&quot; and  the &quot; Waltham &quot; have already  sailed from Basra with about  13,000tons of dates.  It is hoped that a distribution of dates will  be made early in March.    Meat.-- Notonly do the supplies  available justify the present scale of rations,but it seems  that they will warrant an increase in this scale in the near future.   It isof interest to note, however, that the  reports received, from the Live  Stock  Com-missioners show that, in almost every-area the full ration is not being taken by thepublic, and this is attributed to the following,  amongst other, reasons :      (1) The  absence of restrictions on the purchase of offals, rabbits, poultry, &amp;c.;     (2) The  plentiful supplies of pork in some districts ;    (3) The  disinclination  to buy frozen meat when the  supplies named above are           readily obtainable ;    (4) The. inability  of  some  classes .of  the community  to purchase meat  at the         -  present prices.    As regards (2), it is necessary to make the comment  that the revocation -of thePigs Sales Order  has naturally led to considerable  inequality in the  distribution,  ofthe supplies of pork.   The pigs are absorbed, in the nearest market, with the resultthat many of the  large  industrial towns, particularly London, are very short of this class  of meat.  With regard to (4), strong  representations  are being received, asking for differential prices to be prescribed for imported meat.    The supplies of live stock coming into the market are  now subject to fluctuationsbrought about by the operation of the sliding  scale of prices.  At the commencementof each month, when the higher  price becomes effective,  fairly good supplies of livestock find their way to the market, but the quantities offered in the latter part of each.month are proportionately small.  ,4  There is still  a certain  amount of objection to the use of  frozen meat, but thiscomes more from the  butcher than from the,  consumer, and in-  some cases is,merelyobstruction on the part of the retailer who  does not desire to handle it...    / -
    The supplies in store remain at  a very satisfactory level, and no difficulties inconnection with the provision of storage are now arising.    Oilseeds. -Practically all purchases of oilseeds and oils by the Ministry of Foodhave ceased, owing to the large supplies accumulated here, and the general tendency towards lower prices.  Tallow, oleo oil,  and premier jus have  been released from control, and can be handled subject to  an observance  of  the  maximum pricesregulations.               ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.    An Order, dated 16th January .1919, amending the Imported Onions Order, 1918,reduces the price applicable on a sale by a licensed broker in the  first instance, andon a sale by retail.             PART  II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD  POSITION.                                    IMPORTS.    The total imports of  the principal foods and feeding  stuffs in the week endedJanuary 18th (231,200 tons) were above the average  of the first three  weeks of thecurrent calendar year (220,600  tons), the first  20 weeks of the current cereal  year(186,900 tons), and the 52 weeks of  1918 (191,800 tons).   There was  again a goodsupply of  wheat and flour  (135,300 tons as equivalent flour) and a great  improvementin other cereals  (41,900 tons).  There were good imports of  bacon (16,900 tons),lard (2,500 tons), butter (3,200 tons), and tea (4,300 tons), but  the imports of cheesewere again less than  50 tons.  Fruit arrived in larger  quantities, especially apples(5,700 tons), bananas (1,100 tons), and oranges  (8,900 tons) as  well as  2,100 tons ofonions.    The totals for the first 20 weeks of the cereal year beginning 1st September 1918are compared with the corresponding period of  the preceding year in  the followingtable: Total Imports for first 20 weeks of Cereal Year. 	1918.

Meat. In the week ending January 11th an average number of cattle and sheeppassed through the markets in Great  Britain, and  the  estimated supply  of  home-fedmeat was about 15,000 tons,   The quantity of refrigerated meat released was about,500 tons.  The figures given in Table Bl show a reduction in the average  for thefour weeks ending January 11th.  This is due to the falling-off of  supplies in the christmas week, and does not indicate a reduction in the current consumption, which appears to be slightly above the ration quantity.    Jam. In view of the proposal to de-ration jam, special interest attaches to therecent returns from manufacturers, which  show the total  civilian  output of  jam inDecember as 20,800 tons, including 7,600 tons of marmalade.  The prospective output
for  January is  put at  31,600  tons,  including  20,000 tons of marmalade, and  for february 29,400 tons, including 20,300 tons of  marmalade.   The stocks on 31st De-december are returned as 18,300 tons, including 3,600 tons of marmalade, while stocksof pulp are returned at 35,800&quot;tons., a considerable increase on the stocks in handon 30th November (28,000 tons).  -   &apos;              &quot; &apos;, ,    The  total output  in the year 1918 was 338,000  tons&apos;, including 87,000  tons. ofmarmalade, as  compared  with 285,300 tons in  1917-18.  Excluding army supplies,the output in 1918 was 271,800 tons, equivalent to 4&apos;4  ozs. per head per week.    The consumption of manufacturers&apos; jam (including marmalade) during the paRtthree months may be estimated as follows : 	October, ,	November.	December. ;Stocks at beginning of month -Output during month.....

Stocks of meat were enlarged  in  the week ended 11th January by 5,000 tons, or per cent., while stocks of canned meat were reduced by 1,600 tons, or 6 per cent.,and other meat by 1,800 tons, or 16 per cent.   Stocks of condensed milk increased by ,800 tons,  or 10 per cent.;  otherwise there were no material changes.    The quantity of bacon stored by the Ministry of Food has increased from 18,100tons on December 14th to 52,200 tons on January 1.8th.
