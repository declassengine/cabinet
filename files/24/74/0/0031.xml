A. nrhls do his  brita&apos;:FAY OF THE POLICE,(MEMORANDUM CIRCULATED  BY  THE  HOME  SECRETARY).4w      I have received from the  Commiesloner  of  Police a resolution passed by the Representative  Board of the  Metropolitan Police Forceasking for an immediate and substantial increase  of wages and basingtheir claim on the sstimated  increase in the cost of living.   Thesame demand also figured in the resolution recently sent to theGovernment by the National Union of Police and  Prison Officers.      The Commissioner of Police, in forwarding.the resolution from  ;the Representative Board, draws attention  to the  need for obtaining the best recruits possible for  the Police  Force,  having regard to thespecial.position in which they  are placed, the  temptations to whichthey are exposeds and the responsibilities of their duties in pre-serving public order and security; for  these reasons he thinks that a&quot;slight further increase af pay would not  be inappropriate and wouldassure a superior class of man&quot;.   To give effect to his recommendation the Commissioner makes oertain  proposals into whioh I need not nowenter.1m1MM1      The War Cabinet will remember that  on the  occasion  of the PoliceStrike last August a substantial increase of pay was  given to theMetropolitan Polioejwhioh was believed to  meet their  grievances inthis direction in a generous manner.   From a preliminary examination.of the figures in my Department, it would not appear  that a strong case FCV an increase of pay can be made out on the  ground of the in-creased cost of living.   On the other hand, the sonsiderationsmentioned by the Commissioner of Police are very important and ought not to be disregarded by the Government.    The question,  however, of  -increasing the pay of the Metropolitan Police cannot  be entirelyseparated from the general question of police pay throughout thecountry as the rates payable in London have an immediate  effect in  theprovinces and in Scotland.      I have discussed the matter with Sir Ilevil Macready, and he .makes the suggestion, with which I agree, that there  should be an inquiry by an impartial body into the whole question of police payboth in London and in the rest of the country^ and  that the best formof inquiry would&apos;be one made by a Committee consisting mainly, if not-entirely* of members of Parliament.      I should be glad if the War Cabinet would  authorize me to grantsuch an inquiry and to announce at once that it  will be made.E.S.30th  January, 1919.
