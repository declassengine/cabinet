U/Jj, CAB IMP.G.T.6797.              MControl of. Building for Land Settlement *11          memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture                           and Fisheries.          In the course of some correspondence respecting building forLand Settlement the JVirst Commissioner of -forks claims, in accordancewith a decision of the War Cabinet (1/.C.496 iain.12), that the functionsof his Department cover the whole of the building work, -advisory andactual, that might be entailed in tho scheme of buildings for small -holdings for the County Councils,          The position is as follows:-    (l)  liy Board is responsible for the approval of all schemes  presented by County Councils for the creation of small holdings  including the acquisition of land, the erection of houses and other  buildings thereon, the alterations of existing, building&apos;s, roads,  fencing and other work of adaptation.   The Board have to defray the  excess cost cf the work in so far  as it will not be  met by tha rents  charged.   In order to- exercise due supervision I have appointed an  architectural staff who are about  to issue a series  of type plans to  the  County Councils as a basis for the work of their architects,  together with particulars of standard fittings and materials for  whioh my Department will obtain due1 priority,   I understand the  County Councils are approaching my Department with a request t*5  submit to them the names of suitable architects whom they can employ  for  the purpose, a matter with which my architectural adviser, i^r.  Lawrence Weaver, is specially qualified t? d9al*    (2)  On the Small Holdings Colonies for which the  Board is directly  responsible, some half dozen in number at present, similar work  of  adaptation and housing is required.   On two of tho  colonies tho  building operations,  interrupted  in 1918 by the Cabinet18 decision  to stop all work not  directly  required for war purposes, must be&apos;  immediately resumed,  as any further influx  of colonists  is held  up
  for lack of accommodation.    The Heath Hill estate is similarly  unavailable until the alterations for which. arrangements,&apos; are being  made.   The 7/olsh Colony is almost-without buildings.   In all cases  temporary provision by hutments is being arranged as well as pcrmonant  buildings.         Briefly, the First Commissioner of V/orks claims tho transfer ofall this work to his Department.   If his view is upheld my responsibilityas regards the provision of small holdings is ended.   Sucooss both asregards the men who take up the holdings and the finance cf the schemesturns mainly on tho buildings, and agricultural considerations weigh asmuch as architectural,   By means of our Local. Commissioners my plansaro all laid to reduce delays to a minimum in tho discussion andsanctioning sf schemes;  if a third department is to bo introduced theywill become intolerable.  The County Councils who have been accustomed to deal with the Board over such matters are working heartily with us:they will resent a new reference to the Office of  /orks.   i          as regards the building, adaptation, and repairs on tho Boardsestates, which form relatively a small matter, I cannot contemplate a procedure which will require the Director of a Colony needing a new pigstye or the alteration of his    : cowsheds to refer not merely to his chief with whom he is in regular personal contact but through him toanother Department, who will then have to despatch an officer to enquire into and carry through the business.   Such a procedure may belogical but no Department must be asked to conduct business enterprisesunder  such restrictions.   I have no wish to contest the generalproposition that the First Commissioner is responsible for the building of the Government, but I submit that such general principles must beliberally interpreted.if any ministerial responsibility is to remainand if any rapid progress is to be made with the tasks before us.  the obstacles are numerous enough without adding to them within themachinery of Government itself.14th February. 1919.
