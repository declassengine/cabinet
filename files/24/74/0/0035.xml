M.H:1 -              It will be remembered that the Bill which was    introduoed by me in November talaat could not  be proceeded with    for laok of time.   It was approved, after prolonged and    detailed examination, by the Home Affairs Committee, who also    approved the declaration as to Poor Law Reform which I made on    behalf of the Government in introducing the  Bill.              I now circulate a draft Bill which follows closely    the linee of the Bill of last See3ion, together with the    following letter to the Acting Chairman of the Home  Affairs    committee, in which the substantial points of difference    between the two measures are explained.                                       0,  ADDISON.                                      i    3 c ^.IS,Local Government Board,    Whitehall, S.W.1.LOCAL GOVERNMENT  BOARD,     Whitehall, S.W.I.        38th January, 1919.My dear Fisher,          I am writin? to ycu as Acting Chairman of the Home &apos;Affairs Committee to cay that since the intredaction of the ministries of Health Bill, 1918, I have pome to the conclusionthat the passage of the Bill and its operations as an Act willbe smoothed by the insertion of certain alterations which are shown in the enclosed draft of a Ministry of Health Bill, 1919.          The purport of these alterations (apart from a fewwhich are purely of a drafting character) ia as foilewe          TITLE.  &quot;Ministry of Health&quot; takes the plaoe of&quot;Ministries of Health&quot;, and is clearly a far more convenient titlefrom the point of view of the Department for England and wales which will be created under the Bill.

The effect of these two insertions ie  to enable workto be tranuferrs&apos;- to and frowi the Ministry of Health as oooasionarises, in addition to the transfers of work whioh were previous-ly specified in the Bill.          PAGE 3, IIM 18.   This paragraph, which reproduces in substance ths provisions which stood in paragraph 1 of the first schedule in previous drafts of the Bill, is inserted in view ofthe objections whioh have been raised to the form of the previousBill on the ground that it contained no reference to the transferof Poor Law functions not relating to health from the Ministry ofHealth.   It expresses no more than ths Declaration of Polioythat I was authorised to make.          FIRST SCHTOLS.   The expression &quot;Fire Brigades&quot; hasbeen altered to &quot;Fire Engines&quot;, and the references to Piers  and harbours and Lisjfct Railways have he in omitted as the result  ofeno^iiries made into the exact nature of the powers and dutiesof the Local Government Beard in relation to these matters sincethe First Schedule was originally dram up.          If, as I antidote will be the oase,  you feel itdesirable to bring these alterations to the notios of the HomeAffairs Committee, I hope that you will be able  to hold a meetingof the Committee for the purpose without delay;   for I am most anxious to be in a position tr introduce the new Bill at theearliest possible date after the meeting of Parliament.
