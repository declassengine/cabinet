I     ^ FORTNIGHTLY REPORT  ON REVOLUTIONARY  ORGANISATIONS^Gim^S  U  W UNITED  KINGDOM AND  MORALS ABROAD.                       ;-w-!   B71 3           (circulated by the Home Secretary.)     The outlook during the  past fortnight has beoome rather dark.    Strikes havebeen taking place all  tver the country on the question of the forty-seven hour week/ which has now  bebome almost as universal a question as the  12r$ one was lastyear.   Probably the men got the forty-seven hours tot easily,  without having tofight for it.     My Glasgow correspondent reports that the revolutionary movement iscertainly gaining ground, and he thinks that the strike thr^aton^!  for next liondaymust be very carefully watched.   He thinks (and the same viev/ is taken  bycorrespondents in other parts of the country) that one of the causes  for discon-tent is the liquor control and the high price of beer.   The extremists  supportthe present restrictions because they know that if men could congregate  in publichouses, they would not be driven to attend the revolutionary meetings.     My correspondent  at Nottingham puts the.grievances of the workers in thefollowing order:-   1. The shortage of  tobacco and beer.  ,   2. The scrapping of the various National factories.   3. The discontent among discharged soldiers and sailors ab*ut  what they call    the failure to redeem promises made to them on enlistment.     He thinks that if the men Were made to understand that these complaints arein process of being met, the discontent would subBide,     My Coventry correspondent says that Bolshevism is unpopular, but that thereis a very strong feeling with regard to unemployment and the length of the working hours.                                                         -  -     It had always been foreseen that serious Labour trouble would followdemobilisation, and the wonder is not that it has come so soon, but that it hasbeen delayed so long.    Un the 20th January, a secret meeting of  the  NationalAmalgamated Committee  was held in London to disouss the coming strikes.   After a .long discussion the meeting,  came to the conclusion that the excuse which was usedfor calling the men out in London would not justify a National Conference for deciding upon a National strike.   McMa nu3, who had attended from Glasgow,reported that he was doubtful whether the strike which was to take place nextMonday would be universal, and he advised the Committee to wait and see  thestrength of the strike before calling a National Conference,   It was finally agreed to watch Glasgow, and if it took a firm line with regard to the shorterwirking week, a National Conference would be called to decide upon a  national strike.   It was thought that the Londtn strike would collapse in a day  or two.The members attending  this Committee were as follows:-                            George Peet   *f  Manchester,                            Dingley,      &quot;   Coventry,

It will be observed that they are all extremists,  and it is, therefore not surprising that they put no oonfidenoe  n their official Union representatives,The balance of their funds, however, amounts only to  35.7s.3d.        My Liverpool correspondent says that both these Societies are very active   in Lancashire.   Their heavy defeats at the polls has decided them to con-   concentrate themselves upon this County.   They intend to found a Labour College   for Lancashire, either at Lianohester or Liverpool, in order &quot;to bring Lancashire   up to the standard of Glasgow and South Wales&quot;.   For this thoy want an initial   sum of  5,000.JOHN McLEAN.        Sinoe his release from prison,  this man has been making a series of   revolutionary speeches in Lancashire.   He appears to bo convinced that the   Social Revolution will oome this year.   His programme is for the  i&amp;iners to come   out first on some economic question;  the other-members of the Triple.Alliance   will follow suit/and then the unofficial workers&apos; committee movement will, oome   in. ,  He thinks that with the miners, the transport workers, the railway workers   and the engineers on strike, and the Army, lfavy, and Police either sympathetic   or powerless, tho Government of tho  country can be transferred to  the workers,   either peaceably or foroibly.   He hopes, therefore, that tho Government will   refuse the six hours&apos;&apos; day to the miners,        Though Lie Lean is mentally unstable, there is sufficient method in his   speeches to attract largo audiences,   fro begins by telling them that he has   been extraordinarily successful among soldiers and sailors.   He then relates   his sufferings in prison, and states that his food was drugged and poisoned,   and that he would have died if he had eaten it;  that conscientious objectors,   Sinn Seiners, and even convicts -undergo such treatment that many.die, others   become insane or commit suicide, and that the strongest have their constitutions   undermined;  that those of the conscientious objectors who died of pneumonia   had a particular bacillus injected into thorn by the prison staff.    Ho goos: on   to say that in order to koop the War spirit up, tho Government wa3 in the habit   of sending information to the Germans which would enable them to sink merchant   ships, and that the&apos; &quot;Liisitania&quot; wan  one of thoso sunk in this way.   Then he&amp; goes on to introduce the&apos; subject of  Revolution.   He nays ho does  not mind being   imprisoned, because ho is more good  to the oauso in prison than out.   It was  &quot;not Mr, Barnes who secured his release, he was released because, the Government   knew that whilo he was in prison the Socialist cause was m. king a  thousand   converts a day.   uo then taunts the&quot; Lancashire poople with being  behind the
49  4ENT FUR A SOVIET AT SHEFFIELD,     A socret meeting was held at Sheffield between the Sheffield Workers&apos;Committee and representatives of the soldiers and sailors.   Tho object was to forma Soldiers&apos; and Workers&apos; Council for Sheffield, but&apos;the idea has been abandoned forthe present.   MoManua and Murphy, who were both present, received a serious blowduring the recent Election, and they both  state that they will never stand again.Their future weapon is to be the industrial one,HSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS,     The Tottenham Branch of the National  Union of Railwaymen has resolved Wtelegraph to the Prime Minister, demanding the release  rf all conscientious objectors.   They will follow this with  a  Petition, and they intend that downing street shall be  &quot;snowed  under&quot; with postcards.   The Petition will be run by the&quot;Herald&quot;.                                &apos;IflONAL COUNCIL FOR CIVIL  LIBERTIES.     This Council has  issued a  leaflet  containing tho  words, &quot;Labour can at any minute make Government&apos;impossible, and  the workers know it&quot;.   The suggestion  is that any concession can  be  won  by  a  general  strike.  INDUSTRIAL&apos;WORKERS OF  THE  WORLD.     The members of this American  Anarchist  Association are elated at having heldh meefcing in Finsbury  Park  -  the first  in  many years.   They appear&apos;  to  be[combining with  the  extremists  of the  Electrical Trades Union and the Amalgamated j&amp;ociety  of Engineers.  OSITIOH  TO INTERVENTION IN  RUSSIA.                                 .&apos; &apos;&apos; r     Though the outcry against  intervention is loud,  the  motive  is: apparently  not Isympathy with  the Bolshevik regime,  but the  fear  of  individual  soldiers and sailors M being sent  abroad  again.   Even the  extremists have realised  that it would  be [Useless  to call a national  strike  on suoh a question.   What they hope  is to call la strike on an economic dispute,  and then use it  for the  purpose of  stopping (intervention.    Labour&apos;unrest  in France-is  not  far  behind  what  is  reported  from England.In the  24th all the workers  of the various Metros and&apos;trams  came&apos; out,  and  generallears were entertained  that  tho  strikes  would spread.    The  French  GovernmentAppears to have been dangerously indifferent to the  question of  unemployment  on^mobilisation.   One of  Clomenoeau&apos;s  intimates said recently that  the Government[as sitting on a volcano,[POLICE AND STRIKES.                    \                        J    .    At a,recent meeting  of  the  Birmingham Special Constabulary, the Lord[ayor  (Sir David Brooks)  recommended that after demobilisation of thejonstabulary  a special  reserve- should be.formed of men  who would be willingClyde and South Y/ales.   His audiences number from 400 to about 1200 person?about twice the number - that have attended Socialist Meetings,
   to come out on duty in oases of emergency.   The regular Police resent this   because they think that tho Reserve &quot;ould be used to break a Police strike,&apos;-THE PROGRESS OF BOLSHEVISM ABROAD.        The present position as regards the spread of Bolshevism appears, to be as   follows:-        In Russia there are signs that tho present Oligarchy in Hoooow may be de-   throned before very long.   Hitherto they have suoceeded. in putting down in-  surrections such as that of Yaroslav and in terrorising the bourgeoisie, but from   intercepted letters it is clear that disaffection in the Red Army and Uavy is   growing.        Bolshevism is sproadingcin German Austria and to some slight-extent among   the Czecho-Slovaks.        In Germany, its position is obscure.   The Spartacists have been beaten in   Berlin, and the Government appears to realise the danger of Bolshevism, but at   the same time there are signs that they are prepared to take the risk of   Bolshevik outbreaks in Germany if only the poison may spread among the Allies.        On the other hand, the Governments of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Holland,   Italy and Spain are now thoroughly awakened to the danger.        The Danish Government is preventing Russians from entering the country.   The Swedes are taking steps to root out the local Bolshevik agenoies.   The   Norwegians appear te think that the movement will make no progress unless the   Allies aro driven out of Russia or the Spartacists are successful in Germany.   The Swiss Government is taking stringent measures&quot;.   After expelling the Bol^   shevik Legation they set to work methodically to investigate the revolutionary   movement in the oountry and they,have arrested a considerable number of persons   and intorned them in a fortress.   At the same time, they appear to have   information that a freBh revolutionary movement is brewing.   In. Italy,   Bolshevism appears to have had a set back, but matters change so rapidly in that   oountry that this may be only, temporary.   The position as regards Spain is not   encouraging.   There is a great deal of Bolshevik propaganda in and about.   Barcelona, and as soon as it was decided to arrest the Russian leaders with a   view to deportingjthem they disappeared.   Nevertheless, the Government is fully   alive to its danger and is seeking British co-operation&apos; in tracking down foreign   emissaries.        Great efforts are being made by Belshevik propagandists to penetrate&apos;France   and England,   Only a few days ago, the Swiss Police found nearly a,ton of   Bolshevik leaflets and pamphlets printed in English and French in some secret   printing press, which has not yet been discovered;  but the propaganda has berne   little fruit as yet, for in the unrest which is accompanying the process of   demobilisation there is as yet no trace of any political motive.        In Bulgaria alone Bolshevism seems to have made no progress.                                                B .H .T28th January, 1919.
