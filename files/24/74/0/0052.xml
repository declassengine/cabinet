     *                       MINISTRY OF SHIPPING.                  ASSISTANCE TO GENERAL DEMIICIN  AT NOVOROSSISK.        .  \*\\    6 7-ly/i ^deference to War Cabinet  decision No.502 of 14thm_______,^P/pre^^r//1918, in which it was approved &apos;&apos;to establish touch   with Denikin at Novorossisk and afford him all possible assistance   in Military material/1 the Army Council on the 24th January   requested the Shipping Controller to provide tonnage for Military   material, principally ammunition and clothing, amounting to   about 14,000 tons, from the United Kingdom, and one ship is   now under orders to load.  In addition they have asked for   the shipment of large quantities of Mechanical Transport from   Italy and France.  Further quantities of Military stores are   to be shipped from Salonika and Egypt, and one ship is already   under orders to load.  The material for which so far requisitions   have been received will require the use  of about 5 ships of   5,000 tons deadweight each, and if the quantities, outlined   by the War Office materialise, further shipping will have to   be placed on service.  In addition two shiploads of mules   from Salonika have been asked for, and mules are noF about   to be shipped.        The Shipping Controller third-is it right to call the attention   of the V/ar Cabinet to the request of the Army Council and  the   action being taken by him, in view of the discussion which took   place at a meeting of members of  the British Empire Delegation   held at Paris on the 20th ultimo regarding the general question,   of assistance to Russia, the decisions at which might to some   extent be taken as modifying the  previous decision oi the ftar   Cabinet. K      The decision referred to is  as follows:-      It was  agreed:.(1)  That the  Prime Minister and the Secretary of State       for Foreign Affairs should  make it clear at,the       conversations that we could not agree to a continuance       of intervention in Russia or of Subsidies to the       forces of the other Allies  engaged in operations
   with this object,    If,  however,  some effort could   be made to bring the contending parties  in Russia   together, which the British Empire Plenipotentiaries   could regard as satisfactory,  such as summoning   the various parties to meet for example  at Salonika   or Lemnos, the withdrawal of the  British Empire   Forces at present  in Russia would not be immediate.Thst as regards any steps which the  Great Powers might   think it necessary to take in order to protect   against invasion any independent  state about to   be set up, we should be  ready to  co-operate.
