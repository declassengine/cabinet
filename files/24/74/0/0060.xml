COMMITTEE    ON    FINANCIAL   BISKSATTACHING TO0     THE    HOLDING   OF    TRADING   STOCKS. To THE EIGHT HONOURABLE CHRISTOPHER ADDISON, M.D., M.P., Minister of Reconstruction. SIR,     1.  We have the honour to submit our Report upon  the  matters referred to us.   The1 first  meeting took place on the 14th February, 1918, and in all we have held  thirty-four meetings and  examined  seventy- one witnesses.  A list of the individuals, firms,  associations and chambers which have  assisted us in our deliberations will be found in Appendix A to this Report.     2.  The great industries connected with  steel, iron, zinc, copper, lead and tin have been very adequately represented, and the same is true of cotton, spinning and weaving.  The timber and leather trades have also tendered evidence.   In addition to evidence  tendered by  manufacturers, we have heard witnesses repre- senting merchants,  including some important firms with experience  in both branches.   Corporate  opinion has been collected  from  the  following Chambers of Commerce amongst  others,  London,  Manchester, Birmingham, Halifax, and Huddersfield,  and from the Manchester Importers&apos; and Exporters&apos; Association, the Wholesale Textile Association, the Federated Forgemasters, the Federation of Master Printers, the Central Council of  Controlled Firms, the National Chamber of  Trade representing the distributing trades and retail shopkeepers, and the Federation of British Industries.   The  last  named represents about 73*0 firms, 120 large associations and about three thousand millions of capital.  Its official representative stated that the views he was submitting  embodied in his opinion  &quot; practically the whole  of the manufacturing thought of the country.&quot;     Other  angles of view have been obtained from the Trades&apos; Unions, the Labour Party, the  banker, the accountant  and  the  taxing authority (the Board  of Inland Revenue).    We  do not claim it would have been impossible in the time to have heard everyone; but we spread our net wide by acquainting all interests through the Press or by letter of our existence, and we have refused to hear nobody.  In the circum- stances we have thought it best, in the interests of the State and the trade of the country, not to  protract our sittings,     3.  It has been difficult, when surveying the field of our enquiry, to avoid traversing questions under more detailed examination by other Committees.  Obviously the supply,  distribution and  control of raw materials and existing financial facilities, are matters which bear an intimate relation  to the holding of stocks necessary  to  manufacturers and merchants.  Those questions  are,  however, in the more immediate province of two important Committees.  We have tried not  to trespass on the fields of their labours, beyond what was necessary to a correct apprehension of the problem  assigned to us for investigation.     4.  The great central fact brought to our consideration is the enormous rise in the prices of raw  material and goods.  To quote a few instances from the evidence:                                                                    1914.        1918.                                                                   s.  d.         s. d.

Mahogany, per sq. ft., has risen from bd.  to 2s.  6d.     We do not accept responsibility for the typical character of all these quotations, but they represent, on I lie whole not unfairly,  the movement of prices.     5.  No such rise as this has been known in our generation.   To find a parallel we must go back to the struggles of Europe in the Napoleonic era a time from which lessons may be learnt, although  the con- ditions of labour and employment were widely different, and markets had not become cosmopolitan.   Times of high prices are usually followed by times of depression;  and it is urged that such depression is the  more certain and acute when the main cause is the ravage  and waste of war.   Without entering upon debatableground, five main causes can be  adduced as likely to operate  in the reduction of general prices.  Insurance of^War risk necessarily disappears, whilst the carrying capacity  of the world, on  the  restoration of normal conditions, will probably be ultimately in excess of trade requirements.  This means a lowering of  freights. Thirdly, labour on demobilisation will be more plentiful than during the war, with the result that there will be a fall in wages compared with the rates prevailing during the war.  Fourthly, after the war, the demand for military material ceases, and the country&apos;s capacity for production is switched on to the supply  of staple commodities, now standing at scarcity prices.  Fifthly, if the wise recommendations of the recent Committee    (21329.)  Wt. 40580-687.  5000.  1/19.  D &amp; S.  (J. 2.
on Currency and the Foreign Exchanges obtain acceptance, there will be a &quot; steady and continuous reduc-tion &quot; of the increased issue of Government Notes until an effective gold standard is attained.   To thesecauses may be added a sixth,   Confidence has a potent effect upon trade, and want of confidence reacts uponthe trader.   Bankers are fearful of lending.  Enterprise is timid of borrowing.     6.   For these and other reasons the trader of this country, expecting a fall in general prices, is reducinghis stocks to a minimum.  His view, moreover,  is  that wherever high profits are now  being made, owing tothe rapid rise in prices, they should not be spent  or dispersed in any way, but held  over to meet what h%regards as inevitable future loss.      &apos;                                                                l-*     It  has  been argued, to reassure the trader, that falling prices do not necessarily injure him.   Hegoes on buying and selling.   If  he sells cheaper he buys cheaper, whilst the rate  of profit may  remainsatisfactory.   Undoubtedly  there is a measure of  truth  in this argument.    Much may be achieved  byprudent operations.   The  loss during a period of falling prices is certainly not so great  as has been  put to us by many witnesses.  And the level of prices in the future is hardly likely to be as low as that prevailingbefore the war.  Yet we consider, on the whole, it has been established that this apprehension is well founded,and a considerable drop in present inflated prices is  likely to affect prejudicially many of our staple  industries.In  some cases profits may  merely return to their pre-war  level, but  in many  others.there is  likely to beactual loss.     7.   A natural  corollary to this apprehension is  that the trader  should wish to take a very  conservativevaluation of his unsold stocks.   As he fears  future loss,  he desires  to carry  over the bulk of  his excessprofits, and he urges that the Government share of those extra profits (80 per cent, plus the Income Tax onthe balance of 20 per cent.) is so great that the amount to be carried over is wholly insufficient to meet the anticipated losses which will fall entirely upon him.    The bulk, therefore, of the evidence before  us has centred around questions of taxation, which,  though not actually mentioned  in our terms of reference, are inevitably involved in them.     The trader puts forward three lines of  possible relief:         (1) Lower rates of taxation during the war.       (2) The Government  to bear a  share (out of the taxes now  received) in any losses after the war.       (3) A re-definition of &quot; profits &quot; now  chargeable to taxation, by way of the allowance of special reserves             as  expenses in arriving  at profits, or more particularly by the adoption of principles  of valuing             stocks, when making up periodical accounts,  other than  those generally  obtaining in industry             hitherto, or admitted by the taxing authorities.     It is here necessary to turn aside and make a brief examination of the principles underlying valuation.    8.   The custom of  business is to ascertain the result of its trading from time to time by a survey of its operations.   Commercial  practice has fastened upon a  year as the most convenient period over which thissurvey  should extend;  and the practice of  accountancy has been  to  regard profits  (or losses)  as  arisingfrom the sales during this period.   (In an economic world otherwise constituted, traders might have preferred to hold that the profit or loss of the year is the result of everything bought or done in that year, in which casethe profit of the year might not be determinable till some years after.)    The ideal method of making  up the Trading  Account of the year  might be to charge it only with thecost of the  goods actually sold in the year (corresponding to the sale prices credited in that year) and tccarry to a separate account all expenses relating to  goods not sold during that year, as in suspense on accountof the next year5s trading.   In practice this course is  inconvenient, for no one can say at the time of purchasewhen the goods unsold will be sold.    The same effect however  (viz., that of  confining the trading profit to the sales of the year),  is obtained by  a  contra-entry  representing the goods unsold at the end of  the year.    As the entry for Stock which appears  in a Trading Account is merely intended to cancel the  charge for the Goods purchased which havenot been sold, it should necessarily represent the cost of the goods.  If it is more  or less than the cost, then the effect is to state the profit on the goods  which actually have been sold, at an incorrect figure.  From the gross profits resulting from this account fall to be deducted charges on  account of the diminished value ofthe capital assets of the business through wear and tear, &amp;c, actual  or anticipated losses on debts and other expenses, which entail some  periodical evaluation  to get  the  net  profit.  The general overhead working expenses are of course usually charged as applicable to a particular period of time and  fairly represent thecharge which should be made against the sales of the year.  From this rigid doctrine one exception  is verygenerally recognised on prudential grounds and is now fully sanctioned by  custom,  viz., the adoption of market value at the  date of making up  accounts, if that value is  less than the cost.  It is of course  ananticipation of the loss that  may he made on those goods in the following year, and  may even have  theeffect, if prices rise again, of attributing to the following year&apos;s results  a greater amount of profit that thedifference between the actual  sale price and the actual cost price of the goods in  question.    9.   The ground has now  been cleared for an examination of the &quot;base stock valuation &quot; theory, whichlias engaged much of our attention and nearly all that of our witnesses.  We will endeavour to state it withfairness stripped of occasional inaccuracies  of thought- and extravagance of claim.    Business  is a  matter of continuity extending over a  considerable period of  time.  Long and prudentviews are necessary.  Apart from the disturbance of war, the raw material in certain trades, and more rarelythe finished or partly finished goods in other trades, are subject to great variations  in value.   When  warsupervenes this uncertainty of values permeates further into industry.    The advocates of the base stock theory of valuation hold that profits made on selling Article A cannotbe  ascertained,  with strict. accuracy,  until  Article  B,  which  was bought to replace A,  has  been sold.Similarly the profits made on selling B are not ascertainable until Article C has been sold.  In other wordsthe division of profits into short periods of  time gives illusory results.    In a manufacturing business of a given magnitude there will  always be a certain quantity of raw material,goods in process and finished goods.  Similarly,  in a merchant&apos;s business, there will be a certain  quantity of stock  in trade.  For convenience  sake we. will call these quantities &quot;the immanent stock.&quot;             Ip    The idea of the base stock valuation system  is  to take this immanent stock at a low figure.  At the com-mencement  of business  the  figure  must be  the  actual cost.  But so.  soon as normal profits accrue a portionthereof is devoted to writing down the immanent stock,  and this process is repeated until a conservative,and  sometimes a nominal,  figure is reached.  Bankers  pursue  a  somewhat  similar policy.  They writedown their buildings to perhaps break-up value.; they take a conservative view  of doubtful debts, and theywrite down  their holdings of securities to beyond the dictates of ordinary caution.    The object of both trader and banker  is to stabilise profits, though there  may  he a mixture of other jttxotives.  A bank cannot  afford to  show declining  profits; secret reserves are necessary against undisclosable
 losses.  A business does not like to exhibit its profit (or loss) to rivals.  Both are afraid of  undue greediness in shareholders  or  partners asking for larger distribution.      Everyone will  admit that good times should lay by  for bad times.  Any criticism, therefore, of these methods is mainly  directed against the form they assume.   Accountants, with a few exceptions, consider that these practices misrepresent the facts.  In  good  times large  profits  are made.  If it  is desirable tojnake reserves against the.future, part  of  the  profits  realised should be  set aside  as reserves and  so de-Vominated.  If  goods have been  bought for  50 and their market price has not fallen below  50  at the time of striking  a balance, it is a misuse of language and a travesty of fact to write their value down to  20 out of profits made by selling something else.   The correct  procedure, it is maintained, is  to  place the difference of  30&apos; to reserve.   The other side retorts &quot; No, I always require  a certain quantity of these goods; they are  like my plant and buildings; and I write them down to a value which I consider will hold over a term of years.&quot;  The accountants reply, &quot; Surely you get into a quagmire of  inaccuracy.  Buildings and  plant and machinery have recognised  allowances for depreciation; your &apos; immanent  stock&apos;  will vary with the magnitude of your business.  Why make a prudential reserve by assigning a value to it which is known to be at variance with market value ? This stock is not plant, but  is destined  for sale and is being sold continuously.&quot;  And referring particularly to the contention that the profit on Article A is not ascertain- able until Article B, which replaced it,  has been sold they add that they cannot accept any relationship between the successive sets of transactions.   They also observe that looseness of  language leads to looseness of thought.  A capable manufacturer keeps his records so that at every stage he knows what his raw material and goods in process have cost him.   The assignment of values to the stock which bear no relation to its cost tends to obscure  his survey.     The complaint is  often made by the base stock valuation school that an  insistence on the system of valuation at cost or market value is really to force business to write up values.  The boot is on the  other leg. No  writing up takes place when  material is valued throughout at  what it  costs  or at market,  whichever is less.  On the contrary, the claim to value  stocks at a base figure is a claim to  write them  down at the expense of profits.     10.  Before reviewing generally the evidence or suggested measures  of relief,  the Committee propose to advert to the concession made by Government in what is usually called the &quot; White  Paper.&quot;     There are two main concessions one concerns those who have employed the more usual methods of valuing stock, and the other those who follow the base stock method.     In the first concession an allowance is made for the fall in value of stocks held in the last accounting period to the extent to which they are realized in the succeeding two years.  In the second the base stock  method is recognised where it  is the practice of the trade.  It is more convenient to commence by examining the grounds upon which this second concession is based.     There is, so far as we are aware, no statutory definition of  &quot;profits.&quot;   Mr. Clark, the official witness from the Inland Revenue, in his evidence before us, referred to three cases.   The Sun Insurance Company v. Clark, which Went  to the House  of Lords.   Smith v. The Lion Brewery  Company, and the  Usher Brewery case.   In the first case Lord Moulton used the words &quot; we have it by our own reasoning and I think by the action of all commercial men that the proper way to ascertain profits  .   .   .&quot;     Lord  Justice Farwell in  the second case said,  &quot; the expression &apos; Profit of  a trade&apos; bears its ordinary signification as used by business men in business.&quot;     In the third case  Lord Loreburn said &quot; profits and  gains must be estimated on ordinary principles of commercial trade.&quot;  All these three dicta base the ascertainment of profits on commercial practice.  And it appears that in  the absence of a statutory definition the  Board of  Inland Revenue has felt itself  unable to contest the base  stock system of valuation where it has prevailed.  As the practice is  repugnant to the views which Government  and the majority  of this  Committee hold as to the correct system of accounting (cf. also preceding paragraphs 8 and 9 of this report) this concession has not been extended beyond the  point of obliga- tion.   In all there have been about twenty-four applications from various branches of industry to come under this concession.   Fourteen have been  rejected or not pursued by the applicants.  In five the practice has been established for sections of  the stock and details regarding the others are in course  of settlement.     In our judgment industries which have obtained this concession have established no  further title to relief. They will commence the post-war period with stocks valued considerably below their market price.     11.  As the vast bulk of the industries of the oountry will not have  the benefit  of this concession,  it remains to examine the one which we have first mentioned.     The witnesses who came before us as representatives of industry considered this concession unworkable and wholly inadequate unworkable  because the  physical identity  of the stocks sold cannot in practice be ascertained; inadequate as only relating to one set of sales.  The Board of Inland Revenue,  we understand, hope to be able  to overcome the  first objection to the satisfaction of the trader.   That is to say, a business will not be required to prove that the particular stock sold is that which was originally held.  For example, if the stock at  the end of the  last  accounting   period  was  .1,500 tons,  and  1,000 tons  were sold  in the succeeding two years, the concession would cover  the  whole  1,000  tons, whether  they  were part of the original 1,500 or not.  Indeed, the official witness went further.  He expressed the personal view that if the sales were only 1,000 tons during the  two years the business should be allowed to  take-the remaining 500 tons at their market value at the end of the two years, and date back this  loss just as if they had  been sold.     We consider it essential when effect is  given, by the promised  statutory regulation, to the undertaking in the White Paper that these points  should  be clearly conceded.     12.  Whatever be the decision on this question, the claim that the relief given by the Government should be continuous and^  cover  more than losses occasioned by the sales of the stock  held at the end of the last accounting period is really the crucial question for determination, and runs like a connecting thread through- out the evidence adduced before  us.  We propose to summarise the arguments advanced in  support of this claim: -(fp         During this war^ there has been a phenomenal rise in prices.  As the cost of  production lags some-       what behind a rise in prices,  capital during a period of advancing prices makes unusual  and great       profits. This has been indisputably the case during the war.   The great industries of the country have       been most prosperous.   Owing  to the exigencies of the State immensely the greater part of their profits       has been diverted to the National Exchequer.  After the war there will eventually he a very heavy fall       in prices.   Possibly the fall will not bring trade prices to the previous level, but  it will be unquestionable-       ably very great.  As the cost of production does not fall as  fast as prices, capital will suffer unusual       and great losses.  These losses  capital will be unable te sustain, for the State has absorbed the reserves       which capital would otherwise  have accumulated during the antecedent period  of prosperity.    21329                                                                                          A3
        &apos;   Capital further adds that the action of the State has been altogether capricious.   Industries which      as a whole have been in the habit of keeping large undisclosed reserves by means of base stock valua-      tions have been allowed to retain them, whereas  everyone,  in  these exceptional times, would have      adopted the same practice.  The limitation of relief to a few has given rise to a sense of injustice.    13.  There  is,  we think,  no complete answer to this last contention.  The State has allowed the basestock valuation in&apos; certain industries only, because it was in  effect bound by existing case law to make thfl^admission.  It could not have done, otherwise without recourse to special legislation.   In all  industrieiJfwhether receiving this concession or not, it has left untouched and untaxed the reserves accumulated prior tothe war period.   On the main issue, the real reply is that the State must take its revenue where il can find it,and that in subsequent times of depression it has no hidden cache from which to repay losses.  The State isthe taxpaying community.  If the more prosperous of that community fallen evil times, and if assistancecan only be rendered by additional  demands on the less prosperous, the position is irremediable.    14.  Is, then, the problem set us insoluble?  We do  not think we can usefully address ourselves to morethan a part of it.  There are certain to  be some cases where  the drop  in prices will be very  great.  If it isnot in such cases practicable to avoid grave losses by a resort  to &quot; futures &quot; and forward contracts, we thinkthat it is undesirable to foster the presumption that businesses have a  claim in all  circumstances to be keptalive by State aid.   Should the business be of such importance to  the  country as to justify its sustention in face of  all loss, the question would have to be considered on  its merits as a thing apart from discriminatorytaxation.   Ordinary remedies devised  for normal cases would be unsuitable.    We are likely to be attacked in another quarter for not suggesting  any relief to  those who pay no ExcessProfits  Duty.   Much may be argued  in favour of a similar  right to assistance.  Our reply is that, in ourview, the State  is not acting here  as  a charity organisation  society.   Rather,  borrowing a simile from the cattle and poultry yards, it is endeavouring to keep in good condition its milch cattle and the geese that laygolden  eggs.    15.  We might also  be expected  to provide relief for cases where a business  has denuded itself of itsimmanent stock, at the instance of the Government, to meet immediate needs.   Such cases hardly fall withinthe terms of our reference, but we think they have an equitable claim for consideration, which is best preferred to, and granted by, the department of State to which the assistance was  rendered, and which can judge the merits of the claim.                                         SUGGESTED REMEDIES.     16.  The more hopeful line of approach to  a  partial solution of our problem lies in a consideration ofthe present rate  of duty.  An 80 per cent, duty encourages  extravagance, for a manufacturer or merchantthinks lightly of increased expenditure  when only one fifth  of the increase falls upon him.  Enterprise isdiscouraged, the reward being paltry.   Little margin is  left for renewals, development and capture of newmarkets, to say  nothing of reserves against bad times.  When we put  any suggestion for relief to a witness,and coupled with it an alternative of a simple reduction of the duty to 60 per cent, or 65 per cent., we cannotrecall a single case where he did not plump for the reduction.   Indeed, if the rate had been left at that figure,  little would have  been heard of the base valuation argument,  and this Committee would never havebeen called into existence.  We are of opinion that, if the rate had not been raised  beyond, say, 65 per cent.it would have been wholly reasonable to expect and require that taxpayers should  furnish from  the balancesuch reserves as  are adequate to  meet  the difficulties which this Committee is called upon to consider.  Andwe think that there is much force in the contention of witnesses that the revenue accruing from such a rate would have been little, if at all,  lower than that obtained from an  80 per cent. rate.     It  is difficult, now that the war is in effect terminated, and the situation of the  taxing authority is underreview, to formulate any proposals, particularly when we are necessarily in entire ignorance of the  intentions of the Government.  We prefer  as a remedy, provided it could be  made compatible with the current require-ments of the Exchequer, that the  rate of duty,  for the  accounting period approximating to the year 1918,and now in the  course of  assessment, be reduced to 65 per cent., on the understanding that the duty so given up is retained in the business,  and not distributed.  We regard it as  most desirable that the position ofbusiness should be  specially strengthened, when entering on the threshold of a  period in which markets haveto be reorganised or created,  and in which industrial conditions are in a high degree uncertain.  This pro-vision would be without prejudice to  the concession of a still lower rate for any future periods, if the stateof the Exchequer permits.   It is necessary to add this qualification, because,  while  the reduction to  65 percent, for a period that lies in the future, entails no such  loss  of revenue as must follow a reduction in respect-of a period which lies in the past, and has been already under the anticipation of the higher rate, any materialreduction  below 65 per  cent,  in  future  periods,  though beneficial  to  industry,  would, in our opinion,undoubtedly diminish the aggregate yield to the Exchequer.     Such  a reduction for 1918 might  well  be  accompanied by a  withdrawal  of the first undertakingprovided in the White Paper, for the  latter was, after all, largely  consequential upon the raising of the duty to 80 per cent.     .17.  If, however, in the  present state of the National Exchequer,  the course we suggest is impracticable,and the actual cash must be available  to the Government, we recommend that a portion of the duty now to bepaid  be regarded not as  a  final payment of tax, but as a  suspensory reserve, held on joint account  by theGovernment and the taxpayer.   The portion so reserved should be  represented for the time being by a specialkind of War Loan,* which would  be so held for five years.  Thereafter this reserve would revert entirely to the State; or, in circumstances to be set out below, would become wholly or in part (with accrued interest)the property of the taxpayer.     The advantages of this scheme are threefold:          1.  It affords tangible evidence  to  the taxpayer of  a definite provision made by the  State towards             prospective post-war losses.       2.   It fixes  a maximum limit to the Exchequers ultimate liability on account of such losses.       0        3.  Capital experiences great difficulty in the financing of its  business  during this period of inflated&apos;             prices.  Relief  is at present afforded by excess profits earned, but not paid in to the Government             until eight or ten months after the close of the year under assessment, and by excess profits             earned but not  paid in during the  running year. &apos; The existence of this reserve affords valuable             collateral security, for it reassures the banker at the moment when anxiety is acutest, i.e., when             profits are declining to a critical figure.     We suggest that the amount of this reserve should be 20 per  cent, of the average excess of profits above                      * It will be necessary to consult the Treasury on the feasibility of the scheme.
the standard in the last two years under the charge to Excess Profits Duty.   (The Chairman and certain members of the Committee are of opinion that this percentage should be considerably greater.)   When thelast payments of duty are being made, the scrip of the special war loan to which we have referred would begiven for the sum so computed, and ordinary tax receipts for the balance.    The circumstances in which, as we suggest, the reserve should not revert finally to the Government, butwholly or in part to the taxpayer, are as follows :      The taxpayer must show, at the end of five years after the war, that his average annual profits over thatperiod are  less than the amount of  the  percentage  standard to which he was entitled, or would have been entitled, under the Excess Profits Duty, and that these deficiencies have been connected  with holding stockat falling prices (as distinct, for example,  from bad management or  reduced turnover), during that period.He would then be entitled to relief to the extent of 80 per cent, on those deficiencies, and  the  war loan, withaccrued interest,  would revert to him for the amount of. that relief, but for no greater sum than the amountof the reserve.  For example:  A company has an excess profit of  40,000 in the last two years of the duty,or an average of  20,000.  In  its final payments to the Exchequer,  20 per  cent.,  viz.,  4,000,  would rankas Reserve (under war loan).    Its profits standard, for Excess Profits Duty, was  15,000 (i.e., its profits in 1912 and  1913),  or, say,15 per cent, on its capital of  100,000.  If, after the war, its average profit is  12,000, it has no claim, eventhough losses have been made at various times by sales on a, falling  market.  But, if the profit falls belowthe percentage standard*&apos;(6 per cent, on  100,000  ^  6,000),  and amounted, say, to an average of  5,200,it would get relief as follows:                    Five  years&apos; Profits...................... 26,000                  Five  years&apos; Percentage Standard...............    30,000                 Deficiencies   ........................    4,000                 80 per cent,  thereon.....................     3,200     3,200 of the  4,000 in suspense reverts to the taxpayer.  If, however, the profits amounted, say, to anaverage of  4,000 only, it would get relief as follows:                   Five years&apos;  Profits...............     ......   20,000                 Five years&apos;  Percentage Standard...............    30,000                 Deficiencies   ......     .................. 10,000                 80 per cent, thereon......    ...............     8,000        Relief confined to the sum in reserve..................    4,000    It may be well to explain here why the relief proposed should not extend beyond 80 per cent, of the de-efficiency.  It will be obvious that if the deficiency ranked for relief in full, a trader, who found he was likely tobe a claimant, would have no incentive to trade properly and keep his deficiency as small as possible, for theState would bear it all.   We, therefore, consider that some incentive must be given him, which will, in effect,protect the State from such an abuse.    18.  We do not  pretend that the remedy  we propose with the limit suggested meets all the possible orprospective losses on  a falling market.  But it is obvious that any relief must be limited and severely con-ditioned by the financial position of  the Exchequer  in the  difficult years following the war,  and by  theburden  that would be thrown upon other classes of taxpayers called upon to make good the charge to  theExchequer resulting  from the relief.  Hence,  we cut  out altogether from consideration all  trading concernswhich,  though  adversely affected by the fall in prices, still  make relatively  good profits,  and deal only with those which are genuinely hard hit over an extended period, relieving them to an extent which paysmore  regard  to  the paramount needs of the Exchequer than to  the degree  of misfortune  of the taxpayers.Any attempt to make the&quot; relations between the taxpayer and the State  in the matter of relief on a fallingmarket  exactly parallel to and consistent with  then- relations in taxation during the war on a rising  market,is not practicable; and,  if it were practicable, does not  commend itself to us as in itself an aim to be pursued, t    19.  We have had  under consideration variants of the above suggestion:        (a)   in the method of arriving at the reserve.      (6)   in the grounds and conditions of relief.    Under (a).   Granting the necessity for reserving a specific amount, other methods have been put forward for arriving at it in practice.    One method would compute the reserve  as a proportion of the concluding stock coming under the duty,on the ground that a remedy for difficulties arising through stock values should be closely  associated withsuch values.   The chief objection  we find to this system is, that the amount of stock with which businesses arelikely to be left at the end of  the  duty will  be very  variously affected by  the war conditions,  and somebusinesses will be holding practically none.  A second method would compute the reserve as some proportionof the &quot; inflated values &quot; (i.e., the difference between  pre-war prices and war prices) upon a &quot; normal &quot; stockfor each business.   Such a method involves  very intricate and often impracticable  computations  on the accounts of every business, and throws a burden of work upon taxpayers and officials which would, in the finalevent, in a majority of cases prove to be work  thrown away;  for it would be  devoted to the computation of areserve which is not effectively  required;  For these reasons, the suspensory reserve should,  in  our opinion,have a readily calculable basis, such as the basis of actual excess profits suggested above.    (b).  In View of the fact that the point to be provided for is the loss on stocks on falling  prices, it wouldbe natural to direct the relief towards proved and specific losses from this cause.   It may not be difficult for a merchant whose materials are  unchanged  in  character from  purchase to sale, to  pick out specific itemswhere his  stock cost  a  certain sum, and was subsequently sold at a loss; but for a manufacturer  using rawmaterials passing through various stages of manipulation the problem is much more difficult.9) *  The percentage standard in the case of businesses not carried on by companies is 8 per cent., but in the case of new businesses(ie. businesses where there  has not been one pre-war trade year) the percentages are 9 per cent, and 11 percent., for companies andother businesses respectively.  In all cases the rates 9 and 11 per cent, apply to new capital introduced.    f  In this direction the ingenious suggestion has been made to continue the Excess Profits Duty, that is to arrange to give trade inbad times what has been  taken in good.  Indeed this suggestion sometimes goes to the length of recommending that the rate forexcess profits be reduced gradually from 80 per cent, to 20 per cent., and for the recovery of  excess losses to be increased graduallyfrom 20 per cent, to 80 per cent.  The State not having  the purse of Fortunatus, would be in the  awkward predicament of repayingfrom an empty pocket.
.   ; We have preferred to provide for the extremes of bad trade, where the losses are due inferentially andby clear indication, but without detailed and specific proof, to the cause in question; this course appears tobe fully justified by the terms of reference which cover &quot; serious financial losses &quot; only.    20.  We have had under consideration the point that some businesses, which have elected to adopt thereserve method,  would find it undesirable to keep the matter open for five years, and would wish to close thewhole transaction during that period.   We suggest that they should be entitled, on giving notice within twomonths of the end of the third year, to take the average trading results up to that date, on the lines indicatorabove, and to have a  claim upon three*fifths of the reserve only, bringing the matter to a final issue at thWpoint.   The same right would exist at the end of the fourth year, up to four-fifths of the reserve.    21.  It is not possible for our suggested  remedy to have application simultaneously with that promised by the Government under Paragraph  I of the White Paper; and we should accordingly  have recommendedbut for one consideration, that the latter be cancelled.  The Government undertaking relates to the losses uponone set of sales, viz., of the stock in hand at the end of the Excess Profits Duty, without regard to the generalprosperity of the business in  the long run.  It may well be that businesses having  a claim under the white paper,  on the faith of which they are now  resting, will never even expect to be so depressed as to come within  our proposal.   We therefore suggest  that undertakings given in the White  Paper  (made clear, aswe recommend in paragraph  11) should stand; but that each business should state, when making its returnfor assessment for the last period, whether it proposes to come under the White Paper, or, waiving all  rightsthereunder, to come under the  five-year war loan system of relief.  This election is free  from the objectionwhich would attach to an option after the event.    22.   In conclusion, we desire to  acknowledge with cordiality the  services of our Secretary, Mr.  R.

Ilecewber  fsth,  1918.                                        *Subject to reservation below Reservation by Mr. CECIL BUDD, Mr. EENEST R. DEBENIIAM,  Mr. G. BINNEY DIBBLEE and                                   Mr. A. J. HOBSON.    In signing this Report we have accepted the position that for the  purposes of ExcessProfits Duty, Parliament has decided, with a limited  exception,  that stocks must be valued &quot; atcost or market value.&quot;    We feel that in general the effect of this decision has been to bring into account as profits,during a period of especially heavy war taxation based on profits, the provision made againsta fall in stock values, by firms and  companies who have, for many years, adopted the base stockprinciple of valuing,  and very largely to appropriate the results of such prudence for  theservice of the State.  This has certainly resulted in hardship in individual cases, where a small number of prudent firms, who have observed this practice, have not been able  to establish thatit had been the custom of the trade.    To maintain the stability of trading concerns and particularly of Joint Stock  Companies,we regard it as desirable, for the  future, that all firms and companies so electing, should be permitted to  adopt the base price method of stock valuation, independent  of taxation; but theprices  must not be lower than they have actually reached &quot;at cost or market value &quot; withinthe trader&apos;s experience.    We  are of the opinion that the base stock method of eliminating  from trading profits thefluctuations  in stock values, is preferable to the creation of reserves from profits enhanced byrising markets,  and using up such reserves  against losses in  falling1 markets,  as the more accurate  ascertainment, and  more equal distribution of  actual trading profits, over a longer period than one  year, which  results from the^method we  advocate, stabilises the business  andenables loan, or preference capital,  to be obtained on better terms.    Generally also  we are of opinion that the  Report does not  sufficiently recognise the un-doubted  fact that the annual or  semi-annual profits on which  the Excess Profits Duties islevied are reputed and not real profits.  A subsequent fall in prices may  prevent these profitsbeing realised, and thereby an equitable  case for the return of a certain portion of  the Duty is established.    We  also desire to state that if the remedy proposed  in paragraph 16 cannot be granted,then we are of the opinion that the limit proposed as to the amount of the reserve in paragraph 17is too low, and that it should be at least double.
     In our opinion it is equitable that the State should make a better,  though still inadequate,provision for the losses due to the fall in  stock values, the State having&apos; received much the larger share  of the profits during the  rise in values.  It  is in the interests of the State to promoteconfidence in the trader,  so  that he may  devote his whole energy to carrying on his business with enterprise  and thereby give  the largest amount of  employment to labour during thereconstruction period.     A lack of confidence,  due to  a desire to minimise his losses on stocks taken at inflated values,and possibly sold later on at lower values,  tends to limit the  trader\s operations.                                                  &apos;  (Signed)    &quot; CECIL L.
