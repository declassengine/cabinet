The Admiralty have now brought the matter forward again.-   They take, the view that as man&apos;s pension has been earned, it   should not be affected, by, nor should it affect, any other   payment the man receives in respect of duties performed, whether   in the service or out of it.  They therefore recommend that these   men should receive the full monthly increment to their war   gratuity.         The War office take the other view.  They Call attention   to the policy as regards Commissioned Officers and stand firmly   to the original decision to grant these men only half the   monthly increment to their gratuity.         The Gemmittee failed to reach a decision on this matter,.   (Soldiers-&apos;-&amp; Sailors&apos;-pay Committee 45th meet in --, Minute   February 7th 1919), arid it was therefore - decided &apos;         That in&quot; view of the conflicting attitudes adopted by.         the Admiralty and Y.&apos;a&apos;r office respectively, the question         should be referreu. to the War Cabinet- for decision.                                   gor the Chairman      -  .                                     / aA \  m T  IFA &apos; HVT.VT-.TAT3 \
