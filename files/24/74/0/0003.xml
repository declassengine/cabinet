TT55^     I 5-      OIL FUEL RESERVE.       VI     PETROLEUM: PRODUCTION IN RUSSIA.     ^^JOTemorandum for the War Cabinet by the EirstALL                 &apos;.     SEA LORD&apos;          This Memorandum is forwarded in accordance with                   War Cabinet 517, Minute 3.          A Statement is attached showing the approximateproduction of crude petroleum of the principal oil producing countries from 1900 to end of 1916.     Figures obtained from various sources how some variations, but the statement may betaken as approximately correct.     It will bo 3EEN that theRussian production in 1916 exceeded 9,000,000 tons.          The.Russian production is to a large extent consumedlocally for steamships, railways, factories and other industrial and domestic purposes.    The exportable surplus of allpetroleum products from Russia is only a small percentage  ofthe total product and largely consists of lubricating andlighting oils.    In the years preceding the war there was no&apos;import of fuel oil&apos; from Russia into the United Kingdom.   It isdoubtful therefore whether in the most favourable circumstances as much as even 200,000 tons per annum could be secured andit may be pointed out that the price and available quantities.of -Russian fuel oil, before the war, at no time admitted ofany proportion of Naval requirements of fuel oil being met from Russian  sources of supply.          In  regard to the figures in the enclosed statement relating to Roumanian production, the quantity of all productsavailable for export.has varied from 400,000 to 900,000 tonsin the years preceding the war,  and may be taken at about.00,000 tons when the wells are again restored.    Of thatquantity about one-fourth can be assumed to be fuel oil, onthe basis of pe^st experience.
            It will be seen that from these two sources  of  supply  not more than say 350.,000 tons of oil fuel,  on a very  sanguine  estimate and disregarding price,  is at any time likely to be  obtainable from Russia and Roumania and in ordinary  circumstances  probably much less.     In normal  course,  before the  war,  a  certain amount of Roumanian fuel  oil was  usually available a,nd  the Admiralty was occasionally in a position to place  part of  its contracts in that market,  but as pointed out above no  fuel oil was obtained from Russian-            There is of course the  further question of the  possibility of the Dardanelles passage being blocked as was  the case during the late war when no supplies of oil were  obtained by this country from Black Sea Ports.            We must therefore continue for a long time to come  to look to the United States,  Mexico, and Persia for the  bulk  of our supplies.     The latter may be expected to increase  in the course of the next few years from possibly 700,000 tons  .  to about three times that quantity if developments take place.
