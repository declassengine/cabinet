TRANSLATION 0? NOTE FROM MARSHAL FQ H.       In execution of the Resolution cf London of Deoember 3rd, last, Generals Diaz and Franohet d&apos;Esperey have,  at the  request pf Marshal Fooh,  formulated their proposals relative to the occupation of Austria-Hungary.       The following preliminary remarks result from the examina- tion of these proposals.       (a) Line of demarcation.       As the question of the occupation of the whole of the territory of the  Dual Monarohy does not arise,  there can he no sbject In dividing these territories :.nto two  large regions In which the Italian Command and that of the Allied Armies of the East might,  respectively,  extend their authority in complete . liberty.       It is not therefore necessary to consider the tracing of a line of demarcation from the Northern frontiers of Austria to the Adriatic.       (h) The Occupation of Vienna.       In view of  the importance which such a step would have from    a political point of view, it could ftnly be decided  upon, should- the occasion arise,  after a special agreement  between the Allied Governments.       (P) The occupation of Budapest.       &apos;0n the other hand the occupation of Budapest is necessary (although doubtless insufficient in itself)  if we wish  to have the means of enforcing on Hungary the terms of the armistice of November 3rd especially with regard to the Army of Machensen.       The occupation however oannot be effectively completed until General Franchet d(Esperey shall have the necessary means at his disposal.       These considerations being admitted,  the only questions of dispute raised by the comparison of the solutions presented by the Generals Diaz and Franchet d&apos;Esperey are those relating to the occupation of Laibach and Fiume.       Moreover experience of recent events&apos; has shown the. importance of regularizing and defining the actual situation which results from the application of Articles III and  IV of the Armistice of  November 3rd with regard to the occupations on the Adriatic Coast.       These various questions are examined below.       (d) The Occupation of Laibach can only have one object viz. the maintenance of order.       This is being maintained by the present  Serbo-Jugo-Slav garrison; Italian intervention coulc only aroiise conflict.       Therefore everything is in favour of maintaining  the status quo.
      (e)   9UPayisn-0- Iiume.      In order to do away with  every cause  of  conflict  the  safestsolution would be to set up a strictly neutral regime at Piume,to organise there for.example an inter-allied  occupation underthe orders of an American General who would be directly subor-.dinate tc the Higher War-Council.      Such a solution would become necessary in the  last resort,should it appear impossible to  reconcile the interests  concerned.      As matters stand at present it would  appear preferable to arrive at an agreement by the adoption cf a scheme based uponthe following principles :-    - The occupation of Plume shall be Italian and shall be  .under the command of General Diaz.    - At the same time there shall be constituted at piume  ana/u.tpnpm U mbase for the needs of the allied armies of the East,under&quot;the&apos; command of a French General and directly subordinateto General d&apos;Ss^rrey.    - / he French General appointed shall be put in possessionwith the aid of the Italian Command, of part of the  port, ofthe installations and machinery necessary for  the organisationand for-the functioning of the  base, also of a cantonment zonesufficient for the establishment in working order of the Franco-Serbian, detachment attached to  this base.      Further,  the General Commanding-in-Chief the Allied armies in the East shall have the exclusive control of the  railheadFiume-Agram-semlin, the utilization of which-he shall direct.      (*) The Adriatic Coast.      In order to avoid all disputes in the future it wouldappear expedient definitely to  lay down (l) that the occupationof the territories defined by Article III of the Armistice,both on the Italian frontier and on the Adriatic, also  theoccupation of Albania (with the exception of Scutari)  shall beentrusted to the Italian Command.  (2) That on the other hand the occupation of territories on the Adriatic- coast, not specifically mentioned above, and with the exception of theterritory of Fiume, shall be under the General Commanding-in-Chief the Allied Armies of the  East,whose duty it will be definitely to fix the conditions (composition of inter-alliedgarrisons distribution of local commands between the Allies)with a view to establishing there with complete impartiality,a regime of order and neutrality.      The above are the proposals which Marshal Foch considersthat he  should submit to  the decision of the Allied Governments.(Signed)    FOCH..
