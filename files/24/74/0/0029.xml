Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)

FOOD PRODUCTION ?, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 29th January, 1919.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food ? in Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Forty-seven applications for loans for agricultural ? were received by the Department during the past week. The ? value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present ?, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£3,508.

COMPULSORY TILLAGN.

A staff of 47 Inspectors is now engaged in carrying ? inspections of holdings in accordance with the Regulations made ? the Corn Production Act. The reports already received are ? examined with a view to recommendation for the exaction of appropriate penalties in cases in which a default without reasonable ? is found to exist.

PROGRESS OF FARE WORK.

Climatic conditions were again unfavourable to progress during the week. Rain has been general throughout the country and ? ground is in most places in such a condition as to prevent ploughing or other field work. The consequence is that, as compared with ? last two seasons, field operations are at the moment backward.

Favoured by the comparative mildness of the winter ? have thriven well and in most parts of the country there is a reasonable reserve of fodder for spring feeding.

The demand for artificial manures continues fairly ?, though from some districts there are reports that farmers are playing purchases in the hope of prices easing off as the season ?. The Department&apos;s County staffs have been instructed to ? farmers that there is no likelihood of any reduction in prices ? the current season, and that in order to avoid congestion of traffic later  on it is advisable to secure supplies as early as possible.

^lax  Growing in  1919.           From the renorts received by the Department it apoears that farmers are showing a much greater disposition tc son ffcax since they bacame aware that the Government had fixed the prioes of scutohed flax of thfl 1919 crop.   The -prospects of a large acreage being sown this 7.ear are now good, Tmt it is not, however, anticipated that the Bowing will be as extensive as in 1918,labour Disputes.          In several districts the earnings of the scutchers on pieoe rates are relatively low, owing partly to the scutchers working shorter honrB.   In these districts somo&quot;discontent has arisen amongut?the soutchers, and the Department have in&quot;Individual oase&amp;;  hrcu&amp;hjtheir Inspectors, advised millowners in cases where .the scutchers1learnings are specially low through the flax being of poor quality,jto pay the scutchers, on time rate.   Seme millowners have acted  . on this advice and this appears to have had the effect of abating the discontent.          The Workers&apos; Union has made an application for a revision of the rates of wages for scutchers fixed by t*e wages Arbitration Court last jiugust..  The Department have replied that, on the Information before then, and in view cf the fact that the current rates represent the findings of an Arbitration Court which had fully enquired into the matter, they do not feel justified in recommending a revision of the rates.   The Department pointed out, however, that it was open to any of the workers who might consider that they had a grievance warranting such s.tf, course, to make direct application to the Ministry of Labour for further Arbitration.                     1AIITTUMCL OP LIVi&apos;i STOCK.         During the period from 21st to P.7th instant, inclusive,212 applications for licences to slaughter or exnort heifers,55 applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks, and140 applications for licences to export miloh cows were received.
