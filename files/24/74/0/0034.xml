POLITICAL  INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,    --                     -           FOREIGN office.SPAIN /007&quot;.\  g;                              memorandum                                          ON /                          THE SITUATION IN  SPAIN.    ANY expression of opinion on the Spinish situation must at present be extremelyprovisional, as the whole position is uncertain and very different views are held about it.This much, however, is agreed on all sides : that Spain is passing through a dangerous and difficult time.    There are four grave uncertainties which cause anxiety.  They are      1. The parliamentary and  Ministerial situation arising out of the fact  that Count           Romanones is at the head  of a rather  insiomificant Cabinet  formed out           of his  own  small  party, and  is  entirely  dependent on  the  goodwill of           other parties for the maintenance of his position.    2. The Regionalist. and especially the Catalan, problem.    3. The industrial situation and the prevalence of crime and Bolshevism.    4. The problem of Morocco and  Spain&apos;s relations ,with France, and to some extent           with Great Britain.    As to the first, all that can be said at present is that Romanones, who had justsucceeded in forming a Ministry when the last memorandum (Spain/006) was  written,has remained in office; has got himself invited to Paris, where he met  President Wilsonand M. Clemenceau and other Allied statesmen; has no doubt gained some  prestige in spain by these interviews, though the excitement  caused by the announcement of hisjourney naturally led to some reaction; has  appointed a Commission to deal with theRegionalist problem, and, in spite of the refusals  of  Conservatives,  Socialists,  andCatalans to sit on it, has  got a report of it framed  by a sub-committee of which SenorMaura was chairman; and finally, that he has met Parliament and appears, by to-day&apos;s(23rd January) English papers, to have shown  firmness, as in  spite of opposition  fromall sides to his proposal to refer this thorny  Regionalist question to a presumably  finalextra-Parliamentary Commission, he carried his print and obtained a very large majority on making  it clear that  he would not otherwise remain in office.  The Conservativesrefused to face another crisis, and supported  him  in the division.   Obviously a PrimeMinister  who has  the most difficult  problems to deal  with and only  a  tiny partypledged to his support is in a precarious position.   His colleagues, like M. Clemenceau&apos;s,are of little  account.   Like  M.  Clemenceau, his position  and power are personal..But,  as Clemenceau owed his accession to office  largely  to the fact that he plainlymeant business  and  had burnt his  boats  and could only  go on until he  won thewar, so Romanones, though  no Clemenceau, at least stands out in  solitary eminenceamong Spanish statesmen as the only man who never concealed  his faith that Spain&apos;future lay with the Allies, and paid  for  it by the loss of office.  That is obviously as great a strength to him now as it was once  the reverse ; and  it seems  likely that theinstinct of national self-preservation will be strong  enough to maintain in power, at  least as Foreign Secretary if not as Prime Minister, the man who is more likely than anyone else to get a friendly hearing for Spain from the victorious  and now all-powerful Allies.There is general  disappointment in Spain at the poor figure the country has been left to cut by the failure of her statesmen to see her true  interests during the war.  But thereis also a pretty general feeling that, if anybody can save  her from the natural results ofher  weakness and  folly, it is obviously the  man  who had no share  in them, or atleast less share than any  of the others.   Common  sense will therefore be a strong  forcein favour of Romanones.   But in Spain  common  sense is by no means always stronger than personal intrigue on the one hand or fanatical extravagance on the other.  Happily,these dangers to some extent  counteract each other.  Political intriguers, attached tothe old system of lobbying, corruption, and make-believe, which dies very hard in Spain,are at least frightened by the twin portents of Separatism and Bolshevism, and thereforehalf inclined to help Romanones to run the machine, lest presently there should be nomachine to run.  On the other hand, the Extreme Left and the Regionalists, if they are&apos;faced by the threat  of  Romanones&apos; resignation, may be forced to ask themselves whate...V173
  that would lead to, and/in particular, whether it might not lead to the return of Dato&apos;8  Conservatives, who are the strongest party in the Chamber, and whether the man who  put down the revolutionary strikes of August  1917 with such vigour and success, and  who has recently reasserted  his intention of resisting all  encroachments on the sove-  reignty of the State,  would be any  improvement on Romanones from the point of view  either of the Socialists or the Regionalists.   So a prudent  political betting man would  probably bet on Romanones remaining for at least the period of the Peace Conference;  but he would show his prudence by not laying very long odds !       2. Meanwhile the  Regionalist problem is urgent, and  there seems to be a general  agreement  that  feeling is too  excited  to admit of its being shelved for an indefinite  period by promises to  enquire, consider, and report.   It is true that British observers  with long experience of Barcelona  report thatthe agitation does not  appear to interest  very greatly anyone except journalists and  politicians.  But, on the  other hand, when  one hears, as one does privately, of  wealthy men of business, past middle  age, going  back from abroad to Catalonia with the avowed intention of shouldering a musket if need be  for Catalan rights, it is obvious that the situation contains elements of danger.  And the  extreme  demands  of  the  Catalans naturally produce an anti-Regionalist reaction at  Madrid  and elsewhere.  The last  memorandum gave an account of these demands as  submitted to Alhucemas just before his lall.      Directly Romanones  took  office disorderly  scenes occurred in  connection with  Regionalist  meetings  at Barcelona aud Bilbao,  at  least  one person being killed and  several wounded.   The  Bilbao meeting  demanded the complete restoration  of the  old  fueros, or  local  rights  of self-government,  enjoyed by Biscay  before  1839, and  an  immediate fusion of the three Basque local councils into one  rnancomunidad, like that of  Catalonia.   In consequence  of these disorders  and of parliamentary difficulties  the  Cabinet suspended the sittings of the  Cortes and announced its readiness to  grant  autonomy subject to a reservation of the absolute sovereignty of the Spanish State, and  of its right to correct  any  encroachment  on that sovereignty on  the  part of any  Regional authority.&apos; With this object it announced the  appointment of a representative  Commission with the  duty  of  preparing a measure to be submitted to Parliament at  once.  The Commission included most of the leading Spanish statesmen  of all parties,  but many refused  to sit, including not only the Republicans and Socialists but also  Dato, the Conservative leader, and his colleague Besada.   So also  did  the Catalan  Regionalists, though  their announcement of their decision  admitted  that the majority  of their assembly had been in ftvour of accepting seats, but had yielded to the strong  opposition of the minority.  Nevertheless the Commission sat, and included two Prime  Ministers besides Romanones, as well as Cierva, put in to conciliate the army, and such  other leading statesmen as  Alba  and Sanchez de Toca.  They appointed a committee  under Maura to frame a scheme  for autonomy,  and this has worked so expeditiously  that it  has drafted a scheme of some kind which will presumably be the basis of  the  labours  of  the - extra-Parliamentary ( commission of fourteen,  to which the Cortes,  on  Romanones&apos;  insistence, has,  if the &quot; Time.j&quot; report (23rd January)  be correct,  &quot; delegated legislation on Regional  autonomy.&quot;     i No one will envy  the fourteen  their task.  For tnere  are three sections of opinion,  all clamorously demanding satisfaction, and it is  impossible  to satisfy them all.  First,  there  is a  strong Centralist and anti-Regionalist element, naturally  at its strongest in  Madrid  and among the statesmen who have worked  the  existing system.   Dato, for  instance,  who refused  to serve on  the Commission,  has hinted that  he  and his party  have their  own  solution of  the  problem to offer.   Indeed, they have  appointed a  committee to report on the  question.   And numerous public bodies, among them  the  local councils of Castile, have made strong protests against the Catalan  claims.   Even  at Barcelona itself  a  very large  meeting has  proclaimed its loyalty to  Spain.  Then  there are the two wings of the Catalans themselves.  Cambo is a man of business, and  wants &quot;Home.Rule&quot; in order to give  tree play to Catalan  competence  and deliver it  from the  dilitoriness,  red-tape, and  corruption of Madrid.  And this is the attitude of  his moderate supporters.   They want practical reforms,  and  certainly  not revolution or  Bolshevism.   Cambo has made  very  large  demands, but is evidently prepared  for a  compromise.  For instance, he is said now to be willing to  accept the  South African  relation of Region to Sovereign State instead of the Australian, which was the proposal  made by the deputation to  Alhucemas; that is, that Spain should  retain  all powers  not expressly granted to Catalonia  instead of the reverse.   But  liberal as the Govern-  ment scheme is believed to be, it seems to be universally believed that the Catalans will&apos;*  reject it, at least in the first place.   Their mancomunidad and local  municipalities  are  to meet in a few days  ; and even if Cambo now wishes to make real concessions to the
&quot;Government, he may probably, like other agitators, find that he has aroused passions which lie cannot control.  And his Left Wing  does  not really  want what he  wants. The Labour leaders and Socialists mean to use  the cry for autonomy as a  lever for  at least a Constituent Cortes and the destruction of the Monarchy either by a parliamentary or  by  a violent  revolution.   Cambo stands, as he says, neither for Monarchy nor for Republic, but for Catalonia.  He wants the carriere  ouverbe for financiers  and men  of business like himself; and he thinks Catalonia could do her own  business much better than Madrid does it for her.   This is not at all what the Republicans are thinking about, and some  of them  denounce  Cambo&apos;s autonomy as a  capitalist game,, and  say  that workmen  will not be taken in by it.   Cambo has therefore a very difficult  game  to play.   He has  to  raise the nationalist or regionalist flag  high enough to create enthusiasm and make all clases forget  sectional and  economic differences, and yet not so high as to raise expectations which  will  deprive him of the  power of  compromise. His position is somewhat parallel to that  of both the  Ulster and the Nationalist leaders in Ireland with reference to their Labour wings.  Rut he is a man  of will  and ability, and he may succeed in retaining the necessary control.     3.  Meanwhile the whole country, and especially  Catalonia, where the constitutional guarantees have been suspended for a month, is in a  state  of unrest.   A  great many strikes have occurred, but the  fact - if it  be a fact that, as one paper says, they have all been absolute failures may or may not  make for order and peaceful  industry  in future.   Private reports tell amazing stories of the frequency of murderous assaults  in railway carriages, and newspapers assert  that over thirty employers have been murdered  - at Barcelona during the last six  months.   Russian agitators and anarchists in German or  Bolshevik pay are  constantly fomenting disturbances.  Many  of them have  now been expelled from the country.   No doubt their doings and all other kinds of disorder are  greatly  exaggerated by  the press, which,  in  all countries, for its  own  obvious purposes, is accustomed to magnify drunken brawls into alarming riots accompanied by outrage.   But the evidence of the disturbed condition of Spain  is by no means  all newspaper  evidence, and  cannot be  explained  away.   Nor is there  much that  is surprising in it.  All Europe is at the moment suffering from a shortage of food supplies and a super-abundance of supplies of cerebral excitement.   Spain has suffered less from this than other countries, but  her food is  now scanty and dear, and her  Government has always been corrupt and incompetent.  Such a  country is  obviously a  favourable soil for Bolsheviks, if they can get over the natural apathy of Spaniards.   But there is this to  be said :  foreigners easily exaggerate  the alarm because  they come from more orderly countries.   High Spanish authorities declare that the present state of Barcelona, for  instance, is  nothing: to  cause  special  alarm.   It  always  has been  riotous  and disturbed, they say.  Indeed,  for the moment, thanks, no doubt, to  martial-law and the presence of a large body  of  troops  and  a  warship, the Prime  Minister is. able  to announce that the city is quite orderly.  It is to be  noted  that  no difficulty has  been heard of as occurring with  the troops ; and the  general belief of well-informed persons seems to be that there would be no difficulty in putting  down a  revolutionary rising if one occurred.  But hitherto nothing more serious has occurred than the prophecies and threats of Senor  Lerroux and others as to the immediately impending revolution which have been heard so many times before, and  which have, as before,  been falsified by the absence of any serious attempt when the appointed day came round.  There have  been some rather sinking demonstrations of  loyalty  to the King,  and it is  quite  certain that he would not allow himself to be sent on his travels so easily as his Royal brothers of Germany.     4.  The  fourth  problem  which  confronts  Spain  is that of.Morocco.  As to  this there  is little that is new to be said except that  Spain now  officially and  publicly admits by  the mouth of the  Prime Minister  that the  existing  state  of things  in Spanish Morocco  has  long been a scandal and cannot be allowed to continue.   He has announced a  change  of  policy there,  the first  open act  of which is the  decree, issued on the 9th December, divesting the High Commissioner of his military functions. The admission of failure by the  Government and the press is,  of  course,  accompanied&apos; by fears, often felt if only occasionally expressed, that  the  penalty of failure will be a forced  disappearance  in favour  of  France.   Some   Spanish newspapers go so far  as frankly to admit that  Spain,  having  failed  as a colonising Power, must give  up her attempt to be one.  This, however, is  not the general attitude, which rather claims the retention of all that Spain has already and the termination in her favour of the  present international regime at Tangier.   Occasionally even  the old claim to Gibraltar makes itself heard, but  official conversations  officially  repudiate  any intention on the part of Spain to reopen  that question, and even when a feeler is thrown out as to an  exchange
of Gibraltar for Tangier, it collapses at once before the obvious  objections of Englishsentiment, the feelings of the people of Gibraltar itself, and the improbability of Franceconsenting  to  substitute  a first-class Power for either Spain  or  an  international committee at Tangier.     Obviously  as things  stand, if changes in  Morocco are proposed just now it willnot  be by  Spain.   For  the best she can expect is  the status  quo.  Well-informedSpaniards have  some fears but no hopes  of the  Peace Conference.   They  note  thatM. Pichon said in the Chamber  on  the  29th  December : &quot; We shall have to arrangeour  situation in  Morocco, to free ourselves in  the Shereefian Empire from the inter-national restrictions  imposed  upon us by the Act of Algeciras and the subsequentConventions&quot;; and  though  this  language is  vague  they  cannot find it  reassuring.Naturally, they  turn  to England  and  ask her  to continue  for Spain  the good officeswich France by which Spain  was  enabled  to rescue from French ambitions what shestill  holds in Morocco.  No  British Government  would think of disposing of Spanishrights  without Spanish consent.  But British  interests in  Morocco are less important than her interests in other places.  And  Spaniards may well reflect on the opportunitiesthey have lost, and worse  than lost, during the  last four years,  when  they might havemade their North African possessions a means of securing Franco-British friendship and did,  in fact, do just the reverse.
