THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY &apos;S  GOVERNMENT.SECRET.        FIXING OF POST-WAR PRICES  FOR  IRON  AND  STEEL.                                 Subsidies during War.     For the last 2,\ years of the war the  prices of pig iron and finished steel were fixed by the Government at a level considerably below the actual cost of production, the Govern- ment making good the difference to the makers by the payment of subsidies.   As long as the war continued and the Government was practically the sole purchaser of goods made from iron and steel, this  system, which stabilised the cost of raw materials  included in munitions, guns, ammunition, &amp;c.,  was maintained  in order  to avoid constant changes in the terms of  a very large number of Government contracts, and also to prevent profits and wages increasing in a &quot; spiral circle.&quot;                              Policy re stopping Subsidies.     The  position was,  however, completely altered with  the signing of the armistice, when  the  Government  ceased to  be  the  chief purchaser  of  iron and steel goods. It  had been  anticipated  for  some  time  that a  difficult  position would  arise  at the  end of the war owing to the existence of these subsidies, and in September, 1918, an  Inter-departmental  Committee,  under  the  Chairmanship of  Sir Clarendon Hyde, was appointed by the Minister of Munitions to consider the question  of their removal.  This Committee had held several meetings before the armistice was signed, and was generally of the opinion that the subsidies should be removed almost immediately on the cessation of hostilities, and that prices  for private trade  should rise by the amount of the subsidies. The National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers, however, were  strongly opposed to the immediate abolition of subsidies, as they feared it would have disastrous effects on the trade. On the  one hand they feared that so large an increase in selling price would check demand at a critical moment.  But their chief argument against the immediate discontinuance of the subsidies  was the fact that the consequent increase in price would necessitate a big increase in wages, which, in the  iron and steel trades, are based  upon the selling prices of pig  iron and steel.  This  would involve further  readjustments of price, and lead  toprolonged negotiations and unsettlement in the trade.  Moreover, it was pointed out that any considerable increase of wage rates in  the  iron  and  steel trades  would affect wagesthroughout the  whole country. *                           Withdrawal of Subsidies by Stages.     In  view of these various considerations, it was  agreed between  the Federation  of iron and Steel Manufacturers and the Ministry of Munitions that the  system  of subsidies should be removed in two stages.  It was, therefore, arranged that the existing subsidies should  continue  unchanged until the  end of January, 1919,  and that  until  that datemaximum  prices for  home  trade should  remain at their existing  level, and that  onFebruary 1st, 191*9,  the direct subsidies on shell should, be removed and a new schedule of steel prices fixed from that date.  This first change  would not have any effect on  wages.    * To a certain extent the amounts paid in subsidies had already been included in determining the ascer-tained prices for the purpose of the sliding scales, and to this extent the removal of subsidies and the throwingof the increased cost on to the selling price would not increase wages.   The subsidies  paid on pig-iron, forexample, had been included in  calculating the ascertained pig-iron  prices, and similarly, the direct subsidy on steel-making in the case of steel prices.   But in the latter case the amount of the subsidy paid on the pigiron used in making steel, which averaged about  2 10s. per ton of  steel, had not been included.  With theremoval of the subsidies this additional  2 10s. per ton Would have to go on to the sliding scale, and big increases in wages Would automatically follow.  The trade unions concerned  were acquainted with the position, andhad agreed to the view that  indirect subsidies should not be included in arriving at the ascertained prices.But it was recognised that the position would be  quite different when these indirect subsidies were put on to.the selling price.   (C1616)  100  1/19  H&amp;S                                                         A
     It was further proposed that all the remaining subsidies, including the pig-iron sub-subsidies, should be withdrawn on May 1st;  but in view of the difficulties that might ariseowing to the operation of the sliding scales, if costs had not been reduced by  that date,the makers asked to be allowed to bring the matter up again and represent to the Ministertheir reasons for continuing the subsidies or some part of them after that  date.  to illustrate the meaning of this arrangement the effect will be to raise the home price of plateswhich at present is  11  10s. a ton to   14 after February 1st, and unless a fall in costsubsequently ensues, to  16 10s.  after May 1st,     A schedule of maximum steel prices for home trade, to  come into force on February1st,  1919, when the steel subsidies are to be withdrawn, was issued on December 2nd,and  is given in Appendix A.   The price of pig iron is to remain at its present level untilMay 1st, but conditions are too uncertain to allow of any attempt being made  at present to fix prices after that date.                            Export Prices and Drawbacks.     In the case of exports fixed prices  were agreed  upon with the trade which should be free  of subsidy.   This principle was adopted in order to meet the objection of America,on the one hand, that it would be possible for British merchants to export cheap  subsidisedsteel if the prices fixed had been merely maximum  prices with freedom for the exportersto charge as low a price  as they like;  and the general  objection of the other Allies, onthe  other hand,  that  differential treatment would be accorded to different countries  andin different  markets if the prices had  been minimum prices with freedom for  exportersto fix any prices they could get above the scheduled figures.     Export prices have therefore been published for pig iron, unmanufactured steel,  andcertain classes of semi-manufactured steel, based upon the maximum home prices plus theamount of the Government subsidy ; and arrangements have been made with the Board of customs and Excise to collect drawbacks equivalent to the difference between the export prices  and the maximum home prices.   When the exporter is also the manufacturer thedrawback is paid by  deduction  from the subsidies due  to him by the Ministry.   Whenthe exporter is not the manufacturer he is required to pay the drawback when he presentshis export licence to  the officials  of the Board  of  Customs and Excise. * The schedule of Export Prices is given in Appendix B.     The cost of the scheme in subsidies is estimated at say  7,500,000 for the six months from November to April, of which part will be recovered in drawbacks on exports.     The proposals outlined above were  put before the Advisory Committee of Employers&apos;Council representing  the consuming industries at a meeting held at the  Ministry onNovember 18th, and the meeting expressed general agreement with them.                                  Labour Position.     In order that Labour might be, made fully conversant  with the proposed policy, ameeting was held at  the Ministry  of Munitions at which representatives of the TradeUnions and  of the Employers&apos; Associations were present, when a statement was madeof the  arrangements proposed with regard to the gradual removal of the subsidies oniron  and steel.  The extent to which the existence of the Government subsidies had beentaken into account in arriving at  the  ascertained  prices for the purposes  of the  slidingscales was explained as well as the reasons for the proposed increase in prices on February1st and on May 1st respectively.  It was explained why no advance in wages would follow the removal of subsidies on February 1st, although an advance in those wages  which are based on the selling price of steel would follow the proposed removal of the subsidies onpig iron on May 1st, unless in the meanwhile the cost of production had been reduced to-such an extent that no increase in the price of steel need take pilace, notwithstanding theremoval of the subsidies.   This contingency is, however, not likely to arise.   The Minister-asked that the responsible leaders of the trade unions would give their serious considerationto the situation and consult with the employers in the industry with a view to arriving atsome plan for dealing with the situation that would arise  next May.     No attempt has been made to fix prices for manufactured goods (including machinery)either for home trade  or for export.  It was originally hoped that it would be possible to collect the export drawback on manufactured goods; but the machinery devised for thecollection of the drawback for other classes of iron and steel depends upon the existenceof (a) export licences  and (b) fixed prices.   As export licences were in operation for onlya limited number of manufactured goods, and there were no fixed prices in existence formanufactured goods, it was felt that even if the machinery could  be set  u[) (which, was,
 doubtful), the amount of money involved was not sufficient to warrant the labour and expense, and the setback to industry generally that the collection of the drawback would involve in this case.     Special  agreements have been entered into with the galvanised sheet  and  tinplate trades both large exporting industries under which the manufacturers concerned will repay to the Government a fixed sum per ton of steel delivered to tinplate and galvanising works, equal to the total subsidies paid by the Government on the iron or steel in question,. whether used in products sold at home or abroad.  In consideration of this refund the Government has agreed&apos;to waive all right of control of prices for export to neutral markets, and to private buyers in Allied and Colonial markets ; provided that the prices for home trade and for Government orders from Colonial and Allied countries are subject to the approval of the Ministry of Munitions.   This  last provision  leaves the Government free to make bargains with Allied Governments if occasion should arise.                                Advisory Committees.     A Standing Committee of the Iron and Steel Manufacturers, consisting of one repre- sentative from each district, has been appointed to advise the Ministry of Munitions on all questions relating to iron and steel.  Local committees have also been appointed consisting of the Area Steel Committees, to which, may be added representatives of the Ironmasters and of the Consuming Industries.  These committees have been set up to assist locally in the  transition  from war to peace conditions, and  will  deal, in  the first place, with any complaints of unequal  distribution  of subsidised iron  and steel.  The Central Steel Committee has been constituted the final Court of Appeal in  such cases.                               Prevention of Hoarding.     In order to discourage the piling up of stocks of steel during the period of subsidies to be sold later at higher prices, an order has been issued to the effect that no person  may increase his stock of steel beyond the basis level of his stock held on October 31st, 1915, or October 31st, 1918 (whichever is the greater), by more than 100 tons, without obtaining a  permit from the Ministry of Munitions.  These permits are to be granted  freely to all applicants  on condition that a certain sum per ton, equivalent to the amount of the Govern- ment subsidy, is to be paid by the stockholder to the  Government on all excess stocks held on April 30th, or at such time as  the subsidies are finally removed, over the basis stock plus  100 tons.   Persons holding less than 100 tons in stock  are not required to apply for a permit.                                 Prospects of  Trade.     It is satisfactory to note that at the present time the iron and steel trades, with the exception of  a few firms engaged in the  manufacture of special steels,  are busily occupied on peace orders and expect to be full up ^with work for some time to come.   One of the effects of the  policy adopted of gradually increasing prices has been to stimulate the placing of orders at the earliest possible moment,  and the present satisfactory state of the  iron and  steel trades is largely due to this cause.                                  Policy of Allies.                    ,     It is interesting to note the policy adopted in other Allied countries.  In the case of the United States maximum prices were fixed,  based upon  an  economic level, but  it is understood that after the end of December the control of prices ceased.   France proposes to protect  her new  iron and steel industries in Alsace and Lorraine, and is endeavouring, as far as possible, to keep out supplies from outside and  make use  of her  old and her prospective new iron and steel works.  During the war steel prices in Italy were fixed by the Government far above the economic value in order to discourage non-war work.  Withthe fall in freights British steel can now be delivered in Italy at a quarter to a third of theseprices ; but the Italian Government proposes to purchase all imported steel and allocate to consumers at home prices which  are to be allowed to fall in accordance  with  thedecreasing  cost of production in Italy.Ministry of Munitions,      15th January, 1919.
