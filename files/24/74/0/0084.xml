His(45 7)At fDISPOSAL OF NATIONAL FACTORIES.ffiJMORAItDUM FROM THE MIITISTSR OF 1MIITIOHS.f^01.   On January 8th, the. War Cabinet considered aMemorandum by Sir Eric Geddes, Ho. G.11. 6601, on thedisposal of national Factories..   In that memorandum it was pointed out that the National Factories for.disposal could be roughly classified as follows   Class A. (about 16 to 20). Factories which it            may prove, necessary to retain perman-            ently.   Class B. (about 85). Factories which are suit-            able for use as industrial concerns.   Class 0. (about 25). Factories which are not            suitable for industrial purposes but            which will probably be required dur-            ing the transitional period as magazines            or stores, or for breaking down ammun-            ition.   Class D. (about 115). Factories which will revert            to their original owners and to.their            pre-war uses,2,  &apos;It was decided by the War Cabinet that -   (a)  The Ministry of Munitions-should be authorised        to proceed, subject to their discretion as to        what factories should be maintained for arma-        mont production, with the sale of the 85 fao- -        tories mentioned in Class B. of. Sir Erie geddes        Memorandum (pa-per&apos; G. T, 6601)  giving preference,        other things being equal, to Trade Unions, Co-        operative Societies&apos;, and Local Authorities with-        in the limits of legitimate local enterprise.        In these transactions the Ministry of Munitions,        should consult the Minister of-Reconstruction        as hitherto.   (b)  The State will not compete with private enter-        prise in the manufacture of articles of general        trade.3C   A provisional list of the factories included in class A., referred to-above as factories which it might prove necessary to retain permanently, is attached to
                         -this;.Memorandum.   The  principle  on which this  list  was pre-pared  was  that  of ,rstainingat^least one  manufacturing unitfor  ej;ch o   the main types&quot; of  ralniticns  v&amp; th which-a  modernarmy. i s o quippe d.4.-;.  &quot;  It.&apos;appears to  me ,that  it would be  an indefensiblestep merely  tc  retain  this large  number  of factories  indofin-itely, as  potential&apos;  units of munlti.cn mmufacture,  with or. all  nucleus- staffs just sufficient in  number to keep themachinery  in repair  and.in good  order.   If this policy were adopted, the  Government  would  certainly  be attacked;  and indeed in  particular cases has already beon attacked,  for maintaining  these  largo  industrial-units  in a  state of comparative  inactivity,  without making any attempt  to utilise their latent manufacturing capaotiy.   I thereforedesire to  obtain a ruling from the War Cabinet as to  whether some of these Class  A, factories  might not bo  disposed of either by  lease or by  sale to  private firms of recognisedstanding,  subject  tc certain stringent so. d well-definedconditions with regard to the  storage of  the essentialportions of  the plant  and machinery required for-the marai-facture of munitions,  and subject also to  an undertaking that the finn taking possession of the factory will re-convert it to the manufacture  of  munitions whenever&apos;requiredto do so by  the Government.          I have therefore divided the Class A. factoriesinto two sections.   Section  1  contains  the three royal ordnance Factories;  the Royal  Aircraft. Establishmentandthroe factories for  the manufacture of machine  guns, ofspecial types of .small arms  ammunition and of  box-raspirator3which in the opinion-of tho Beoretary of State  for War should for the present at any rate .be. retained definitely inGovernment possession and under direct Government control,;
It is the remaining 15 factories In Section. II  which,  i suggest) might with advantage be disposed  of,  if  favourableopportunities present themselves for diverting  them  to industrial-purposes,, subject to satisfactory  conditions  withregard to their reconversion.on demand  to  the manufactureof munitions.5;    it should be pointed out \bs).t\ at  the present,time,the. Army Is in possession of enormous stocks  of all  theordinary types of munitions of war, such- as,  guns, howitzersammunition, rifles,, machine guns, etc*  etc.   These stocksere so great that It may be  confidently  asserted  that  forseveral years to come Woolwich Arsenal  and Enfield,  v/with the ,..oyal Aircraft Establishment,&apos; Farxiborotygh,,  and a fewsmall units of explosives manufacture,  Will provide  amplemanufacturing capacity to meet all peace-time  requirements.The stocks in hand would, also provide the  necessarymargin of safety to meet tho requirements  of  a  large Armyin the field.&apos;during the short period of  about three  to sixmonths that would elapse before the national  factories which had been disposed of under conditions Indicated in .the preceding paragraph could once more  be brought into  -full, production.&apos;6,    The National Ordnance Factory, Nottingham maybe  cited as a case in point.  This factory was  provision-ally place 1. in Class A.,.  mong the factories  which Itmight prove necessary to retain permanently,,  and  it  isthe only national factory for; the manufacture of  ordnanceincluded in the Class-leaving out of  consideration.Woolwich Arsenal,.  Tho Nottingham factory  is  one  of  thebest equipped factories in  the world  for the  manufactureof guns up to a  calibre of  6&quot; and: howitzers up to acalibre of 9..2&quot;.    .     ^               (.3).  &apos; -
     While there are other national factories, suchas those at Lancaster and at Hunslet, to which the gun-manufacturing plant from Nottingham might be transferred,their general lay-out and equipment would not render them effective substitutes to the Nottingham factory.     Messrs. Cammell, Laird S? Co., who have beenmanaging the Nottingham factory for the Government dur-ing the war, have put forward definite proposals forits purchase,  with a view to converting it at once to industrial production and retaining&apos;as far as possiblethe staff and workpeople, with whom their relationsduring the  war have been extremely good.   The firmwould be willing to purchase the factory, subject tothe following conditions :-   (a)  the firm to store the surplus gun-manufacturing        plant in the factory itself and look after it        at t he G- ov o government rit1 a expense;   fb)  tho firm to re-convert the works into an-        ordnance&apos; factory at any time when required to        do so, and to find the management as at pres-        ent, provided that the Government compensate        them for the breach of outside contracts and        secure them against consequential losses.7.   The case of the Nottingham Ordnance Factory has :been-given as a typical instance.   Messrs. Beardmore &amp;Co.,  are&apos;,  however, considering the desirability of put-ting forward proposals of a similar nature with regardto the National Projectile Factory, Cardonald,.. which hasbeen under their management during the war and which is another national factory provisionally included in ClassA,   Proposals  of a similar nature may very well be madewith regard to other factories included in the list.8.   One of the reasons which led the Ministry ofMunitions to recommend in the first place that a certain
number of national factories should for tho present beretained by the Government, was the uncertainty withregard to the decisions- which night be come to at thePeace Conference on the question of the manufacture ofarmaments by private firms.  It was felt desirable toretain a balanced nucleus of munition manufacturing capacity, in case it should be decided that any futureproduction of armaments was to be carried out by theGovernment alone.        As against this argument, it may be pointedout that.if a private firm were prepared to take overa national factory whether by lease or by sale, subjectto satisfactory conditions with regard to the storageof machinery and tho reconversion of the factory tomunition production, it would always be open to theGovernment to take possession of the factory in any future national emergency x. d convert it at once to themanufacture of. munitions.  In the event of a decisionon the part of the Peace Conference against the productionof munitions by private ,firms, some similar  arrangement will undoubtedly have to be arrived at with the privatearmament firms,&apos; by which they would undertake to storetheir munition manufacturing plant, end give the government lien on it in case of any future emergency*          Arrangements such as I have indicated wouldp*nce the Government in. the position of having  at its disposal, in addition to the ordnance factories andany other national factories of which it might bo
decided to retain control,- a large latent munition pro-due ing capacity in the country which could be calledupon at a momentTs notico and oould be rained to. fullproductive activity within a period of three to six months.9.   After full consideration of the present posi-tion, I therefore desire to obtain the following rulingsfrom the ITar Cabinet   fi)  that national factories provisionally included        in Class A Section II,  as shewn in the attached        list, may, if considered desirable,  be disposed        of by lease or sale to  private firms of recog-        nised standing., subject to satisfactory con-        ditions with regard to  storage and periodical        inspection of the machinery and plant, and the        re-conversion of the factory to the  manufacture        of munitions at any time when the Government may        -require it, the firm also tD give an undertaking        that any such factory would not be used for ar-        mamont production without the consent of the        Government in writing.   In each, case it would        need to be clearly shown that all peace-time        requirements could be fully met from other        sources at the disposal.of the Government and        that- the stocks in existence provided an ample .        margin of securityv  (ii)  that negotiations may be entered into forthwith        for the disposal of the national Ordnance Factory,        Nottingham&apos; and the National projectilb Factory,        Oardonaldy on the lines indicated above *10   In this Memorandum the requirements of the Armyand of the Air Force alone have been taken into consideration,as the Admiralty,.- with the exception of high explosives ofwhich&apos;the- naval consumption is comparatively small, are notdependent on these sources of supply.   The Memorandum hasboon referred in draft to the Secretary of State for War,and I understand, that he is in general agreement with it.-ll,iiol9,
