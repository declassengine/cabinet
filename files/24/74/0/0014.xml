The strength of the various women&apos;s Corps on the11th November was 79,300, the total demobilised up to the23rd January being, 3,694.  Officers and Members of theW.R.A.P. are not being demobilised at present.             Further progress has been made in forwardingrelease orders to Unit Commanders for Pivotal Men; butthe numbers shown in the analysis as released are stilldisappointing.
                In  addition  to  the  ordinary Civil Employment    Form,  a  considerable number of  applications has been    received from Employers  under the  speeding up  JDirect    Contract1  system.   The  total number of applications of    this description received by the Exchanges amounts to    592,944, and of these 519,224 have been endorsed,,                The excess of the numbers arriving in this    Country  on leave over those returning was 22,518 during    the week ended  18th January.    The total excess since the    date of  the Armistice now amounts  to 121,996,  The number    of Officers and mon demobilised whilst on leave reaches    44,773,    This  is  14,773 more than a week ago.UNEMPLOYMENT,                Unemployment is still  increasing at the rate of    roughly  70,000  per week.   The  total number of Out-of-Work    Donation Policies  remaining&apos; lodged on the 17th January    amounted to 519,000, and of these  Policies 62% are held by    women  and  girls.   Details  will be found in the Appendix of    the unemployment in Industries  covered by the  1911 and 1916    Acts,  comparison being given with  a week ago and a month ago.    These  are  summarised below;-                    Percentage  of Unemployment in  Industries                    ____covered  by the  Acts cf 1911. &amp; 1916,    20th December,                     4,59,&apos;;    10 th, January.                      7,80;.    17th, January,                      8,76;C                Unemployment in the Engineering and Iron Founding    Trade  continues to rise, the total now being  159,000 or  11.48?
53Unemployment in Shipbuilding is now 10.024, and having regardto the urgent necessity for increasing the output of Merchanttonnage, special enquiry is being made into this.       Owing to the large number of Policies issued to soldiersat Dispersal Camps, a comparison of Policies Lodged to PoliciesIssued is not a very useful one.   If, however, the SoldierPolicies are excluded, the percentage is the same as theprevious week, viz,, 66%,       The Divisions in which the most unemployment is foupdare the West Midlands, and the North Western,   In the formerunemployment is now 242 per 10,000 of population, and in thelatter 181.   In certain areas of these Divisions unemployment is now in excess of 500 per 10,000 of population.       A large number of payments made on the 14th and 15th.January have been analysed to show the number of payments which have already been made on these Policies and the followinganalyses these payments into four*periods of time;-                              Payments on 14th &amp; 15th,                              _January,__        1-10 days               -  30,5 %       11  -  20  &quot;                   25.4       21  -  30  &quot;                   24.3       Over   30  9                   19.8HOLDING.       The financial proposals with regard to the developmentof housing aooommodation in the Urban areas of
54Bngland and Wales are agreed upon; but no definite decisionlias been arrived at so far as Scotland is ooncerned.    The building season is a short one in England and Wales and in Scotland, even shorter, and the time is rapidly approach-ing when operations for this year sh: uild bo actively put inhand,   -  Delay has&apos; been.experienced in placing the order for building bricks decided upon at a meeting of ministers on 20th December last; but the difficulty in this connectionhas nor; been overooms, and the Ministry of Supply is immediatelyplacing orders.     Orders for a certain quantity of doorsand window frames havo also boon placed by the Ministry ofSupply on specifications furnished by the Lgcal GovernmentBoard, and it is hoped that the Office of Works in consultation&apos;with tho Local Government Board and the-Ministry of supply will be able to divert,.certain unexhausted contracts for officefurniture to the manufacture of sets of furniture, etc, forthe houses to be built,    The release of the Officers and   admen and Quarrymen inFrance; and also the return of road construction material is urgent,     This remark applies especially to the release ofthe Road Officers of the various Local Authorities, .as theimportant work of road making and road repairing is seriouslyheld up&apos; pending the return of those Officers,    It is being dealt with by the War Office,                          (Signed) Brie $eddes.
