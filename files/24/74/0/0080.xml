     Proposal for neutralising Germany1s  advantage from a depreciated ftark and for collecting  an indemnity. &quot;        If, as seems probable, the German lark willbe more depreciated-than the British pound or the Frenchfranc, Germany will have an important advantage in thecompetition in manufactures exported.          German exporters will obtain more Marks in exhange for the Pounds, Dollars or Pesos, for which her .exports are sold, and consequently she will be able toproduce, more cheaply.   The depreciation of the mark will act as a subsidy on exports of manufactures.          Importing countries with protective Tariffswill be able to defend their home production in part, but no Tariff can be made so elastic as to protect fully againsta fluctuating exchange, and countries having no Tariff and perhaps production will be flooded with German manufacturesat the expense of the manufacturers and labour in alliedc ountri e s.          It is therefore of Interest to all manufacturingcountries to find a means of neutralising the advantage toGermany of cheap labour due to a low Mark, and it is ofespecial interest to the Axlies if at the same time they can find a method of collecting part of the indemnity due fromGermany,          Eioth objects can be accomplished to&apos;a materialextent by imposing upon Germany an export tax on manufacturedgoods payable in the currency of the ccuritry to which thegoods are sold.          The tax should be an ad valorem duty deductedby the purchaser, from, the price of the goods, and should bepaid by him  to his  Government.                            i          The Allied Governments collecting these taxesshould pay the amounts Into a pool for division amongst theAllies in part payment of the Indemnities,          But it would be necessary, or at least desirablealso to provide that neutral Governments do likewise.          Neutral Governments, such as some in S. Americaor Sweden or Spain may hesitate to impose and. collect sucha tax for Allied account.                              ...          If the allies are agreed - and the measures proposed are for the protection of all of them though in varying degrees - they .could compel compliance by refusingotherwise.to allow  the particular neutral&apos;s currency to bodealt .in. ive. exchanged over London, New York and Paris, &apos;-which would  effectually prevent, or greatly hamper external trade being  carried on by that neutral.The
          The measure of compulsion proposed was put inforce and -administered during the war by the Finance Sectionof&apos;the Ministry of Blockade for other purposes aad has been provedsuccessfulo          Perhaps an example will best illustrate the working ofthe method proposcd:-          In order to fix the tax to be put upon the german exports, we  must compare&apos; the probable future values of thevarious currencies with the pre-war values.          Let us assume that v/hon the international exchanges - .are freed from control, the relative values of dollars, Francs,and Marks to the Pound sterling will compare with pre-warvalues (omitting all fractions) as follows           Post-war                   Pre- -tar/            ^4                          5            27 francs                   25 francs.            30 marks                    20 marks.          Before the war, if Germany sold  1 worth of goods,she received $5, which she could turn into 20  arks:, out ofwhich she paid her labour and made her profit;  if (on therelative values assumed) she now sold  1 worth of goods, she would receive $ 4, which she could convert into 30 Marks,out of which to pay her labour and make her profit.   she would, thus get 30 Marks for that which she formerly sold for20 ma rks.          To gain the  same amount for her labour and herprofit she could afford to sell the same goods at 20 Marks,worth $oVo instead of $4, and thus under-sell the Britishproducer.          It is true that the alteration in  the cost of rawmaterial and labour will cause a variation  in these figures,but  if British Labour  is as we hope to receive higher wages,the  proportion may be  even more favourable  to German exportsenterprise, notwithstanding higher costs of raw material.         How then */oulci the proposal  operate  in  such cases?         The proposal  is to.place an  export tax  upon the 1&apos;s  worth of  German manufactures equal to  the  differencebetween  ji33 /3  or $4, i.e.  .66  cents.          This  66 cents would  be paid  as a  tax by  the Americanimporter *nd collected by  the  United  States Government  2ndplaced  to the  credit of  tho allies  on account of  the indemnity,and ultimately, no  doubt,  it  would be  used to reduceEuropean indebtedness  to the  United  States.          If  the  same course  is followed in respect  of  all german  exports  credits would  be  obtained by the  allies in  many foreign currencies  which  would unable them to  repaytheir indebtedness  to  neutrals, and  so more quickly  restore the pre-war  international  values  of  their  currencies.          The.amount  cf  the  tax  upon  German exports  shouldbe  fixed for  a  short  period of years  and  should be  revisedfrom time to  time  so as  to  meet  the  real  difference  In thevalue of the  currencies.
          The tax is not intended to be prohibitive, ii   9 9ois intended to prevent an undue advantage in employ--merit of her people which Germany will otherwise-secure fromthe depreciated Mark.   It is intended to secure paymentof part of the indemnities in a manner independent of andin addition to any other methods which may be found to be practical *          During the recent election, promises were made(1) to insist on an indemnity.,, and (2) to protect essential industries.          Tariffs are but poor weapons against depreciatedcurrencies which provide export bounties expanding orcontracting according to necessity.;  combined, however,with such export taxes as are proposed,, essential industriesmay be reasonably protected.          Nor is it easy to collect indemnities withoutdamage to national industry.          Some territory, some gold,, some foreign securities,some merchant shipping; and some raw material..may be surrendered, but these items will pay but a small dividendon the total claims,          i.&apos;hat else remains except payments not. in marksbut in outside currencies?  The method proposed provides the outside currencies besides the means of protecting the Allies&apos; essential industries and The workers engaged.therein.against unfair competition by German laboursubsidised by an internationally depreciated markg
