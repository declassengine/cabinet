Meetings of the Council were  held on Thursday, January30th, and Tuesday, February 4th.    The following modifications in the Meat Rationing Scheme were approved :       (1)  The amount of  meat now supplied to butchers, which is just sufficient  to            cover the ration of  four  coupons at 5d. each, will be  increased by one            ounce in the case of live stock and  by Id. in value in the case  of dead            meat.  This will require an additional supply  of 5,000 tons of meat            per month.      (2)  The ration to the public will still be by means of the existing four coupons            at &amp;d., but the public may be  supplied with any amount beyond the            value of their coupons which the butcher with whom they are registered-            may have available  after honouring  the  coupons  of his registered            customers.      (3)  No coupons will be required  for meat meals in hotels, but bulk rationing-            will  be maintained.      (4)  All further checking  of coupons at the Central  Clearing House  will be            abandoned.    A (33)7383-1  Pk 9  150 2/19 . E &amp; S .                                         A
    In view of the strong desirability of providing a two-ounce ration of butter for as long as possible, it was agreed that     (1) the Food  Controller should personally press the Chancellor of the Exchequer           for early sanction for  the purchase  of 11,000 tons  of  butter  from the           Argentine; and    (2) that all possible steps should be taken  for the purchase of 1,000 tons of           butter now  available  in the United States.    Imports Board. It was reported that shipments of  butter from the Argentine are held up on account  of a strike at Buenos  Aires and  that 1,800 tons are awaitingshipment.    The. Board were  informed that the  War  Trade Department had  expressedwillingness to  facilitate the export of foodstuffs abroad.   A reduction of freight  rates on commercial cargo from U.S.A.  and  Canada  was reported, the  neAv rates being-$1.00 per 100 lbs. and 50 cents per cubic foot at  ship&apos;s  option ; these rates came intooperation on January 27th.    A proposal has  been received  from Sir John  Beale that 30,000 tons  of baconshould be sold by this country to Germany, and that with the cash obtained  a  further30,000 tons should be bought in North America, 5,000 from Canada, and 25,000 from u.S.A.   These  further  supplies should not be used   for consumption in  UnitedKingdom but  should be used for relief purposes in  Europe, being replaced  as  sold by further supplies from North America, thus creating a revolving stock of 30,000  tons for relief purposes in  Europe.   This  proposition  is  under discussion with  H.M.Treasury.    The Consumers&apos;&apos;  Council. The  Council met on &quot;Tuesday, February 4th.  Proposalsfor the decontrol of condensed milk  in April or May next were approved.  The council were informed that the price of  condensed  milk  had already been reduced, and thatit was  hoped  to bring it down  still further before decontrol came into effect; andfurther, that the Milk Section would impress  upon  manufacturers the absolute necessityof having reserve stocks of condensed milk in hand at the short periods of liquid milk.A considerable drop in  consumption was expected, and it appeared quite safe to releasecontrol in two or three months.    The Council received  an assurance that  there would be no deterioration in thequality of  margarine  when control  was removed.  Margarine will, continue to be manufactured  only under  licence from the Food Controller.   The  conditions of thelicence provide for strict supervision by the Ministry of  the quality of the raw materialused, and a weekly test  of  the  resulting product.   If a satisfactory standard is notmaintained, the licence will be withdrawn.    The Council postponed consideration of proposals for  the decontrol  of baconsupplies.    Mrs. Keeves and Mr. AV-atkins were  appointed as the CounciPs representatives onthe Committee appointed by the  Ebod Controller to inquire into the abnormal wastageof potatoes.                            SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION.     Meat. The modifications in the Meat  Rationing Scheme approved  by the FoodCouncil, which are  the first  in the  direction of decontrol,  will result in a certain-measure of competition  between retailers in  respect of the unrationed  meat.  Theywill also be useful as an indication  of the extent of  public requirements at the present level of prices.     The present labour situation gives rise to grave apprehension that the distributionof foodstuffs may be affected.  Every effort  has been made to  fill  up all the provincialstores to the  fullest extent possible with frozen  meat in order that the  necessity for transport may  be minimised if a general strike should  occur.  Unfortunately fewcargoes have  been arriving, but stocks remain at a satisfactory level and there is nofear of these proving inadequate for some time to come.  &apos; &apos;, Margarine.-In view of the supplies of raw  material available, and of  the factthat this country is  now able to manufacture sufficient for all its needs, it has  been decided to withdraw, as from  March 2nd next, all restrictions  on the purchase  of margarine by the public, and to restore to dealers the power of obtaining their supplies from whatever source  they prefer.     From; February 16 to March  1  individual  consumers, catering and residential establishments and institutions, must continue to  obtain their supplies from the dealers
with whom they are now registered, using the coupon  or preliminary demand note, asthe case may be, but without limit as  to  quantity.  As from March 2nd coupons and preliminary demand,  notes will  be required for  butter only, and dealers, consumers,catering and residential establishments and institutions, will be free to buy margarinewithout restrictions of any sort as to quantity or source of supply.     Tea. The  Food Council  has decided  that the  3,000;000  lbs.  of China  teapurchased by this Ministry shall be distributed under the name of &quot; Controlled ChinaTea.&quot;  The tea will be distributed through the ballot  on the lines  of the distributionscheme at present in operation,for National Control Tea.  The wholesale price will be is. 9\d. per lb. (less  duty), and the maximum retail price 3s. 4cd. per lb.&apos;  Wholesalersand retailers will be free to blend the  three grades which have been purchased, or tosell them in their original form, in accordance with the varying demand in differentdistricts.  AMiofesalers will  be remunerated for their services by means of rebates,and the same general directions as to distribution, subject to the variations mentionedabove, will  apply to Controlled China Tea as to National Control Tea.  No retailer,however, may sell Controlled China  Tea unless he  is in  a  position to supply  on demand National Control Tea.     Another sale  of tea for export  only has been held this week, and  all qualitiesoffered met Avith a ready demand owing to the increased export  facilities to Holland.     Dried Fruits. A distribution of some 12,000 tons of various dried fruits will,  bemade next week.  It has been  found possible  to make a  general reduction in  themaximum price of  dried  fruits, and  the Dried Fruits (Retail Prices) Order  has been amended accordingly.  The new prices  will come into operation on February 17th,1919.  The principal reductions are from Is. 2d. per lb. to  Is. per lb.  in the case ofraisins and  sultanas, and to  lOd. per lb. in the case of  currants.     Considerable quantities of Persian dates have arrived, and a distribution will bemade shortly.     Cocoa. Shipments of  raw  cocoa  continue to  be very  satisfactory,  and some,000 tons have been distributed to manufacturers during the past week.     Coffee. Licences for export have been granted by the War Trade Department atthe instance  of this Ministry  in  the case  of  various coffees, which the  SamplingCommittee have found, unfit for home  consumption.     Milk. The improvement in the general position  of milk  supplies has been well maintained throughout the country in spite of the severe weather.  Adequate suppliesof condensed milk were immediately available in  the few emergency cases  in which,owing to temporary  shortages, they were required.     The Milk Control Board have agreed upon a memorandum setting  out the presentsituation and  the  problems to  be  solved, which, together  with  definite proposals, isnow under  the Food Controller^  consideration.   The Consumers&apos; Council  haveexpressed the conviction that &quot; it is absolutely necessary to exercise permanent controlover the  production and distribution of  milk.&quot;  The Central Agricultural AdvisoryCouncil on the other hand  have passed  a resolution  to the effect that it is essentialthat a definite statement should now be  made that the Government do not propose to institute permanent  State control of the wholesale trade in milk.     The following minor measures have recently been taken :        (a)  The Milk Board  have sanctioned contracts for 15,000  churns of the new              10 gallon standard type.   Contracts for cheese  appliances up to a  cost              of 20,0001. for sale to farmers and factories are also being placed to meet              definite orders received by the Ministry.       (b)  The  Milk Board have  agreed upon  [a poster  of  &quot; Recommendations to              Farmers &quot; to ensure cleanliness of milk.       (c)  The Central Milk Advisory Committee has been strengthened  by the addition -              of two members to represent the interests of  the London and Provincial              Master Dairymen&apos;s Association and the Retail Dairymen&apos;s Mutual, Ltd.     Fish. The supplies of  white fish landed from trawlers at the two principal.fishing ports in the East of  Scotland  Division (Aberdeen and Newhaven) for the four months ending the 25th of January, have exceeded those for the same period last yearby about 650 tons.   This is largely owing to the increased areas available for fishingdue to the withdrawal of restrictions  by  the naval authorities.   There has been a keen demand for the fish, with the result that maximum prices  have ruled.  A number oftrawlers  and  drifters have been released  by  the  Admiralty, but  only a small
 proportion of these are. as yet engaged  in  the  fishing; the large  majority have to be re-fitted.      During the period, the  1.7th  to the 31st of January, 15,1.73 boxes of fish were landed at Fleetwood equivalent to 948 tons.  Fleetwoocl has now 19  boats released by the Government, but only 5 of these are working at present.      The strike of the Grimsby fishermen was settled on the  18th of  January, and the situation is therefore relieved.   The number of vessels which have landed their  catch since that date is 1.16, the catch amounting to 82,586 lbs., all of which has been duly allocated.      Central Clearing House.-As a  result  of  the  changes in the meat rationing arrangements recently decided upon,  instructions have been given that the Central Clearing House  of the Local Authorities and  Rationing Division, at which retailers coupons  and returns were checked,  should be  disbanded.   It is expected that  the work will  have come to an  end, and the  whole of  the staff transferred to  other Government Departments by February 15th, which will be the effective date for  the cessation of the services of the staff.  It was hoped that the National  Health Insurance Commission would have been able to take over the whole of the displaced staff as from February 15th;  but  this  has proved impossible  and it will  probably be necessary to resort to  the ordinary procedure (i.e.  Ministry of Labour and Civil  Service Conunis- sion) in order to provide for those clerks for whom other positions are not immediately available.                ORDKRS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE  REALM REGULATIONS.     (1) The Jam (Prohibition of  Export) Order, 1919,  dated 28th January   1919, prohibits except under licence the export of any jam from Great Britain to Ireland or the Isle of Man.     (2) The Oil and Fat Compound  (Maximum Prices) Order, 1919,  dated  30th January  1919, fixes, as from 17th February,  the wholesale and retail maximum prices for Oil  and  Fat compound.   The term &quot; Oil and Fat compound &quot; is defined, and restrictions are placed on  its sale unless it complies with certain requirements.     (3) The Beer (Prices and Description) Order, 1919, dated 5th February   1919, comes into force on  24th February and revokes the Beer  (Prices  and Description) Order, 1918, from the  same date.   Maximum prices are fixed for  all classes of  beer, bottled or otherwise, classified according to their  original gravity, whether on sale in a public bar or elsewhere.  Beer may now be obtained at a cheaper price.     (4) The Intoxicating  Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order,  1919, dated 5th Feb- ruary 1919, applies as  from the 1st  January  1919.    It permits an increase in the United  Kingdom of  25 per cent, in the statutory  barrelage  as determined under the Order of 1917, and allows a higher&apos; average gravity of two degrees.     The following Orders have been revoked as from 31st January 1919 :        (1) The Raw Beef  and ljtaw Mutton Fat (Licensing of Purchases) Order, 1918,             as amended.  This order prohibited dealings in these fats  except under             licence.       (2) The Home Melt Tallows  and  Greases (Requisition) Order, 1918, as amended,             which gave power to requisition all  home melt tallows and greases.      (3) The Tallow and Dripping (Restriction  of Export and Import)  Order, 1918,             which restricted export and import between Great Britain and Ireland.      (4) The Hone Products (Requisition) Order, 1918 ; and      (5) The Bones (Licensing of Purchasers) Order, 1918, as amended.  These two             Orders  gave the Food  Controller power to  requisition bones  and             bone products, and prohibited dealings in the same except under licence.                            ENFORCEMENT OF  ORDERS.   . The  total  number  of  prosecutions reported   during  the  fortnight  endingJanuary 25th is  1,114, of which 1,039  resulted in  convictions.  The  average fine for england,  Scotland and Wales was  U. 13s. lid., and for Ireland 4s. id.  Prosecutionswere reported under 67 different Orders.    Special attention is being given to  cases of profiteering in spirits, e.g., at Huyton-with-Roby a spirit merchant  was fined 200Z. for selling a  reputed quart  bottle ofwhisky on two occasions at a price  above the maximum.    A butcher was fined lOOLat Middlesbrough for selling at excess prices, sellingwithout coupons, and selling to unregistered customers.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF  THE  FOOD  POSITION.                                     IMPORTS.    The imports of the  principal foods  and feeding-stuffs in the week ended  1stFebruary  (176,000  tons), though considerably  higher than  those of the preceding-week  (.120,200 tons), are still below the average of the first five weeks of the year 1919(191,600 tons), or of the first 22 weeks of the cereal year (183,400 tons). *   -There was an improvement  in the import of maize (21,200 tons), sugar (28,600tons), and lard (4,500 tons);  and there  were good  imports of meat (14*800  tons),tea (2,700 tons), and cocoa (3,000 tons), as well as eggs (1,100 tons), onions (6,600 tons),and apples (6,100 tons).   The quantity cf oranges (11.400 tons) was the largest weeklyimport during the current season.    A summary Of the principal  imports since 1st September is given in the followingtable:  Total Imports for the first 22  weeks of Cereal Year (1st.

Meat. Supplies of home-killed meat in Great Britain continue to decline, those for the week ended 25th January being estimated at 12,200 tons.  For  the four weeks ended 25th January, home supplies  at 13,700 tons represented 62 per cent,  of  total supplies, as compared with 76 per cent. Si year ago, and 85 per cent, in January 19.1.6.After a month&apos;s experience, it appears that the ration of  approximately  .18 oz. is notbeing fully taken up by the public.  This is probably due to various causes, the  chiefof which are  the  contraction  of  the purchasing power of the  industrial classesemphasised at  present by the prevalent industrial disputes,.the high proportion offrozen supplies,  and lastly, the supplies of meat of different  kinds  now availableoutside the ration, which in the week ended 25th January are estimated at 3,400  tons,or over 1.8 per cent, of the ration quantity, equivalent to an additional 3  oz. per  headoutside the ration. -    Flour. Table B (1) shows a very considerable increase of  the quantity of  flourdelivered from  mills or transferred to  agents ; the  average for  the  four  weeks endedJanuary  25th&apos;gives on the scale adopted in Table C (2)  an index of 108i-, the highestrecorded for a similar period since 1917.  Statistics of the amount used  by bakers orsold retail are no longer available, but it may be  presumed that a large  part of theheavy deliveries of January have gone to replenish the stocks of bakers and dealerswho had allowed these to become depleted in anticipation of an improvement in thequality of the flour.  The deliveries over a period of  12 weeks are still about 4 percent, below those of a year before.    Other Foods. Of  the  quantities of other foodstuffs passing into  tradeFs handsfor consumption as indicated in B (1) the most notable feature  is the increase in the issues of sugar preparatory to the raising of the  ration and the increase of supplies to manufacturers  at the  end of  the month.  If  Irish  consumption  of   butter  and margarine  be omitted, the estimated quantity for Great Britain is  below that  basedon the present total ration of 6 ozs.   With the home production  of butter  at a    A  7S8S-1                                                                 B
minimum, the chief source of evasion of the ration is removed, and the consumptionof margarine under  the  present  ration justifies  the proposed  removal  of  thiscommodity from restrictions.  The  small  quantities of  tea  in  ballot  for  publicconsumption are not  due to any shortage of stocks in the country, which  indeed  arevery high (Table D) but are the result&apos; of supplies to the trade in the second half oflast year being above current requirements, which are estimated at about 2,400 tons per week for the civilian population of the United Kingdom.     In the case  of cheese (which is not given in the table), there has recently been amarked decrease in the supplies passing into consumption.  In recent weeks estimatedsupplies for civilians in the United Kingdom have been about 1,850 tons, or just  over1&apos;5 ozs.  per head per week, as  compared  with 2,500  tons weekly  in November  last,and an estimated pre-war consumption of 2*6 ozs. per head per week.                                    STOCKS.     The movement in stocks of meat and  provisions in the week ended 25th Januaryhas generally followed the course set in recent weeks ; bacon  stocks have increased afurther 12 per cent., and canned  fish 7 per cent.  ; on the  other hand, cheese stockshave declined a further 14 per cent.; fish (not canned), 10 per cent.; lard, 5 per cent.,and  condensed  milk 5 per cent.   The stocks of the last two articles are, however,high, as also are those of meat and bacon.
