Beyond that period It is clearlyimpossible to make any forecast*                    TRANSPORT     Every step possible has &quot;been taken to ensure sufficienttransport for distribution  of essential foodstuffs.   The ministry are in constant and close touch with the Railway Executive, theExecutive of the National Union&apos; ef Railfmen, and the Read transport board, and every assistance is promised in the.transport of food should the. present Railway and ether Transport services be dis-located by the threatened strike*.     In the event of the Railway transport seriously breaking down,the Road Transport Board, in view of the present distribution of foodstuffs, are satisfied that they can meet any reasonable demands upon them.   The Road Transport Board have registers of motor andother vehicles in every district.   The Pood Commissioners andthe &apos;Transp$t&apos;t Officers of the Ministry are represented on allDivisional and Area Transport Boards, and have been Instructed tcarrange locally with such Boards any necessary transport, includingthe question of priorities.     The Ministry of Munitions, -who control a number of lorries,have also agreed to give the Read Transport Beard all assistancethey can in the transport of food*     The War Office have also agreed to plaee at the disposal ofEood Commissioners such personnel and transport as may bo availsable, having regard to military requirements.   Assistance fromthe military will, however, enly be applied for if there is aserious emergency in any area and the civilian transport available is insufficient to cope with it.                      SUPPLIES.     Generally speaking, the distribution of the stocks of essential foodstuffs gives no immediate cause for alarm shouldrailway communication be suddenly interrupted*     Flour.     The Ministry1a stocks of flcur are large and ttidolydistributed,.  Steps are being taken to increase stocks in twodistricts (the North and East cf Scotland and North Wales) where theposition is loss satisfactory.  Bakers and dealers arc stated tohave good supplies of flour; while millers on an average have four weeks&apos; supply of wheat in hand,
     The recent action taken toy the Wheat Commission to increasethe distribution of flour has proved satisfactory,  the weeklyrelease of imported flour having risen, as the result thereof,from 70,600 sacks a week to over 180,000 sacks, while the weeklyrelease of G.R, Flour has Increased by some 40,000 sacks.     The shortage of Ministry stocks of flour in Scotland baabeen overcome, 40,000 tons having been placed In Glasgowf   U&amp;epresent stocks in S&amp;st Scotland are being Immediately increased.     Bacon,  The Government stocks of imported bacon amount to5(1,000&apos; tons (or about seven weeks1 normal supply).   They are dis-tributed throughout tho country (with the exception of North and3outh Hales and South Midland Divisions) in satisfactory quantities,the stocks toeing hold at ports and in all largo urban centres.  Forthe fact fortnight the hulk of tho arrivals have been going inlandfor storageo  Immediate steps h&amp;vo beon taken to send sufficient supplies to North and South Wales and tho Kidland Divisions,  maddition to tho Government steaks there is widely distributed amon^-st wholesalers about 14,600 tons (or two weeks normal supply).Retailers also have about a weok^s supply, in hand.  Further, asregards rural areas, maay of the population are self-suppliers,     Milkt  Arrangements have been made with tho Roan  transport board&quot;&quot;to e&quot;nsure as far as possible a continuance of supplies of milk to largo urban centres, though naturally this would be one of thepoints of greatest difficulty should any dispute occur*   There areample stocks of tinned milk in the country and they are woll dis^ri*buted*                         HOARDING     The Pood Controller has had under his consideration the question  iof revoking the Pood Hoarding $rder, so as to increase the distr-distribution of foodstuffs in tho interior of the country and relieve theoon&amp;ssttfon at the ports.   He has already granted concessions tohouseholders to stook not more than a sack of flour, two dozen tinsof milk, and a side of bacon, and he does not consider it advisable to go further at the present time.   Any further relaxation of theOrder might seriously Interfere ?.*ith the equality of distribution and act to tho prejudice of the leas v/ell-to-do members of thocommunity in localities where for any reason there was a temporaryshortage of any commodity,   Kor is It thought that suoh relaxationwould materially relieve this congestion at the ports, which is dueto the great increase of imports consequent upon the cessation ofhostilities,   Hand difficulties of transport, and the   shortage.of labour, both at the ports and at warehouses,                       ADDITIONS L  uRBjtNGStoBHTR.     All wholesalers and retailers throughout the country have beenasked to keep their stocks on as high a level as possible.     Food Commissioners have been granted powers to decrease theasiount of any existing ration, and to ration any article of food at present unrationed.     Food Commissioners have already power to requisition any article of food held by any trader and instructions have been issued to themreirtnding them of this power and Instructing them to use it to meet any local shortage,.     Food Commissioners have been informed of all Government stocks in their Division, and have been instructed to move any of these stocks to meet any emergency.     Generally, Food OoMimis si oners have been entrusted with full discretion and poYJers for seeing that the essential foodstuffs intheir Divisions   are sufficiently and equally distributed,MINISTRY OF FOOD,    10th February, 191P,G.H.
