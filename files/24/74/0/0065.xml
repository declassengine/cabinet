THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN ITALY.

Recent Cabinet Crisis.

Signor Nittin late Minister of the Treasury, seems to have realised ? fully than his colleagues the dangerous situation which must arise the cessation of hostilities unless adequate arrangements were made forehand for dealing with demobilisation and the transition from war peace-industry. He had accordingly been pressing for the replacement certain Ministers by more active and capable men, the Ministers in ? being in particular - the Minister of Industry and Commerce, ? Ciuffelli, the Minister of War, Zupelli, and the Minister of Posts Telegraphs, Fera.

? the close of the last session (Dec 1st) Ministers had agreed that reconstruction of the Cabinet was necessary and had placed themselves ? disposal of the President of Council. Orlando, however, perhaps ? to the absence of Nitti on account of illness, delayed action. Premonitions of the break-up were given by the resignations of Callenga, Secretary of Propaganda - nominally because the need for his office no ? existed, but really on account of his attitude to the Jugo-Slav ? - of Callenga&apos;s coadjutor, the Republican, Comandini, and of the ?, Chiesa, Commissioner for Aviation, whose department was transferred to the Ministry of War.

There followed the resignations of Dari, Minister for Public Works, ? on Dec. 3rd) on account of illness and bereavement, and talk the imminent resignation of General Zupelli from the Ministry of War. On Dec, 27th the crisis came to a climax with the resignation of ?solati.    


A rapid patching up was effected just in time for President Wilson&apos;s visit (Jan 3rd), for which it was considered important to &apos;present a united front&apos;. The place of Signor Dari was taken by Signor Bonomi, a member of the same political group as Signor Bissolati (Reform Socialist), whose functions (Military Co-operation and Pensions) were temporarily transferred to the War Office. The other Reform Socialist Minister, Beronini, who had tendered his resignation was in the end induced to retain his office of Public Instruction.

Thus the official notice was able to represent the patched-up Ministry as having undergone no change in political complexion. At the same time it was represented that ? resignation indicated no irreconcileable difference of opinion between his views on foreign policy and whose of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

This official assertion hardly carried conviction and was not ? out by Bisselati&apos;s interview with the Morning Post (Jan 8th). Bisselati there explained that whereas ? insisted on clinging to the letter of the London Treaty, he was himself convinced that the wise and statesmanlike course for Italy was at once and before the Conference met, to abandon Dalmatia entirely to the Jugo-Slavs on condition that Italy retained the whole of ?, with Fiume as a free port under Italian rude. He was further for ? Greece by giving up the ?, Italy obtaining in compensation the concession of the coal-mines at Eregli (Heraslea), and he preferred to the Brenner frontier a line further south, which would avoid the inclusion of any considerable German population: He had, he said, warned Sonnino both against the burden to Italy involved in her presence on the Dalmatian mainland and of the probability of a diplomatic defeat at the Conference, where he would have to encounter the opposition of Wilson and the unwilling assent of France and England.

-------.....;.....ft?!the   The meeting was arranged by the Italian Society of Nations&apos; organ-isation, &quot;The Italian Family for a League of all Free Nations&quot;.   Itwas a ticket meeting, and the body of. the hall and galleries were relatively quiet. If not very sympathetic;  but the large numberof subscription boxes, which could not be closed to their ordinarytenants., bed been necked by Bissolati&apos;s adversaries, who hadevidently made up their minds to prevent his speaking andsucceeded in doing so.J [lowed to deliver on Jamil, but the text of which was published in if Press made all equivocation impossible.  The resignation of the Minister of the Treasury followed on Jan. 16th, gnor Nitti had,  it seems,  announced his intention of resigning before gnor Orlando left Jr/r the  preliminary Paris Peace Conference.   Hiseoision appeara to have been mainly determined by the very ur.satis-satisfactory nature of the reconstruction effected.    The Ministers whose placement he regarded as most essential - Ciuffelli (Commerce),upelli (War) and Fera (Posts &amp; Telegraphs) - were all retained.    He  also said to be in substantial agreement with Bissolati on theuestion of foreign policy.  The reconstruction which  now followed - all  the Ministers havinglaced their portfolios at the disoosal of the president of the Counoil,as effected in a great hurry on Jan 16 &amp; 17 in order that Orlandoight be back in Paris for the first General Meeting of the Conferencen the 18th,   In his choice of Ministers Orlando seems to have beenaided aliaaat entirely by parliamentary,considerations with an eye tohe Elections which are promised for the-&apos;Spring.  The Ministry is how constituted as follows.     President of Counoil            Orlando.     Minister for Foreign Affairs    Sonnino.               &quot;  Colonies            Oolosimo,               &quot;  Finance            Meda,               &quot;  Marine             Del Bono. -         &quot;     &quot;  Industry  &amp; Commerce  Ciuffelli.         &quot;     &quot;  Food &apos;              Crespi.         &quot;     &quot;  Public Works       Bonomi (vice daring),               &quot;  Posts &amp; Telegraphs Fera.

For one year Under Secretary to Minister of Treasury. Beyond this no political experience. A cautious banker of the old school - safe but unenterprising.

G General Caviglia. Not a political appointment. Commanded 8th Army in the final successful offensive. Said to have displayed administrative ability in re-organising the territories occupied after the battle of the Piave.

Riocio. Neapolitan lawyer and journalist, made Under-Secretary of Interior by Sonnino and acted as Minister of Posts &amp; Telegraphs under Salandra. Prominent representative of the Fascio (League of National Defence) and belongs to the Right.

Fradeletto. A Venetian. Culturea; Radical in polities; not taken very seriously.

De Nava. Minister of Industry and Commerce in Salandra&apos;s Government - a man of capacity and energy. Of the Right.

Gfrardini. A native of Udine which he represents in the Chamber; acted as Commissioner for Refugees from invaded Provinces. Now to Offic?      
1 j.   II     Faota.,  ^jOn^-frf&apos;THcl.1rtrti^*a--Twt&apos;-aoi.j.T^ lieutenants--and  stipoort -ru. XJ?i*dmontese - once Mayor of  Dinerolc   Held various offices  in                                * Gi-olittils Governments.. Character  of the r.sw Ministry,   .....................................-I...,,...........i,.     The new combination commands no confidence.    It oo^eaaJs to be merely d signed to secure the  position of thf Government in Parliament and is not fudged capable of dealing successfully  with the- very diffi- oult problems connected with demobilisation and reconstruction.    The most noticeable feature in it is the inclusion of Signor Pacta - obviously with a view&quot;to balancing the defection of Signor IHtti and his followers and of the Reform Socialists by conciliating the Giolittians, who arc still  believed to dominate the Chamber.  The GiolSttian element will also be useful in the rmakin;-&apos; of the coming elections, for which the Government is said to be already pre oaring, and for which Radical organd foretell the fixing  f an early date. &quot;Orland    says L&apos;Units, &quot;is pre nor in,? tc repeat in Italy Lloyd George&apos;s coup de main,  bringing in the elections as a surprise as soon as the new electoral rolls are  ready and while the majority oi the officers and the younger olasses, to whom the franchise has been granted, are .under arms, and therefore unable to vote, with the old - constituencies and the old electoral methods, for the benefit of all the old Giolittian P parliamentary camorra&quot;. &apos; Revival of Party Politics,.    Since1 the armistioe, the  ^parliamentary &quot;blocs&apos; former:  for war purposes have begun to  break uc.  The Mjnione Parlamentare \  - a soalition of Clerioals, Cioiittians and Rrdioals, which once  numbered 1.20 members - has dissolved.    &quot;Its oadual members, Radicals  for the most part,  have  gene their several ways and only the Giolittian nucleus is left  and this nucleus has prudently abandoned the  group name&quot;   (A.P.S. Dec  11th).    Similarly the ffasclo (League of National  Defence) has  been aban- abandoned  by its members from the Left and Left  Centre  (Reformist Socialists, Republicans,  Radicals) and &quot;will  soon be reduced  in its
turn to its ?, the Right Centre, which used to be led by Grippe, but is now entirely identified with Salandra."

On the other hand there has been a rally of Left groups in a new &apos;bloc&apos;, called &apos;the Democratic Entente&apos; ? chiefly with after-war aims, which steadily gains in strength and has already more than 100 adherents. Is is non-Ciclittian Radical and was preparing to support Orlando in his interpretation of foreign policy and internal reforms.

After Bissolati&apos;s resignation the &apos;Uniene Socialista&apos; (Reformists-met and passed a resolution condemning the Government foreign policy and prohibited its member from supporting the Government in Parliament. Bonomi and Berenini are thus disowned by their party. The Reformists are by this action brought nearer to the position of the Official Socialists and will at any rate be in ? in the next session.

The views represented by L&apos;Unita (Mazzinian and Patto di Roma in foreign policy), seem to be gathering supporters among the more intellectual and ? Radicals who desire to return to-party platforms and the break-up of the war &apos;blocs&apos;.

General Situation.

As regards foreign policy Bissolati is himself convinced that the solid public ? of the ? is behind him. Rome, he says, inspired by bureaucrats and controlled by the Censorshio, shouts for Fiume and Dalmatia, the rest of the country is indifferent or even hostile. The extreme democratic movement in the industrial North is opposed by an imperialist and reactionary foreign policy. Witness the serious riots which occurred in Milan on Jan. 17 in connection with a pro-Dalmazian meeting at the ? Theatre get up as a counter-blast to Sissolati&apos;s ? of the previous Saturday (Jan. 11th). "Socialists and workmen organised a hostile demonstration outside the theatre. The police charged the crowd which defended itself with stone-throwing. Fifty arrests were made." (Times. Jan 20th).

The unemployed problem is formidable - especially in manufacturing centres such as Milan and Turin - and delay over demobilisation    
?tailed by Sennino&apos;s Adriatic policy and by the forward policy in ?politania, aimed at recovering the territory abandoned early in the ?, is producing a dangerous ? of mind among the workers. As to ? probabilities of a &apos;Bolshevik&apos; revolution opinions differ greatly. ? is said to take a serious view of the danger. Bolshevik ? is said to have been distributed in Italy by Wrangel, formerly Russian Naval Attache, but this is perhaps to be doubted. Ministers are obviously anxious, as is also the Vatican. Hence perhaps the movement towards a Concordat with the Quirinal and the consent given ? the formation of a Parliamentary Catholic Party (II Partite ? Italiano), which has just put forth a very comprehensive and highly democratic programme obviously designed to take the wind out ? the sails of the Official Socialists.

Orlando&apos;s attempt to concilate Socialist support for his new Government by offering a portfolio to Cabrini (Socialist Right Wing), ? defeated by Cabrini&apos;s refusal.

The proposal in Italy is even gloomier at present than it is else-where. The well-?-do classes, with the exception of an intellectual Minority, appear to be intoxicated with victory and &apos;to think of nothing but crushing the Slavs and dishing the Socialists.&apos;

The mass of the people are disgusted with the muddling of the Government, the delay in demobilisation, in payment of pensions and ? promised life-policies, and are in a dangerous temper.

The best it would seem that can be hoped is that Signor Nitti she should, while in opposition, gather round him a strong ? of Radical and Labour representatives and replace the present Government Defence worse befalls.
