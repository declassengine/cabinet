Rear-Admiral Kiddle reports that the Italian Government declines tosupport Admiral Mola who agreed with the other Admirals in considering safe conducts for requisitioned ex-Austro-Hungarian ships unnecessary.   Admiral di Revel makes differculties: and endeavours to take a leading part in the controlof these ships, and to seize everything ashore and afloat for italy.    Ships allocated by the A.M.T.C. for other dutiesarrive at Venice with troops and re-embark stores and troops,-and ships allocated for repatriation of troops and transport offood are used as troopers for the Libyan Campaign, in flatviolation of orders from London.     The, Foreign Office state that the Italian Government has agreed not to conduct negotiations for the purchase of ex.Austro-Hungarian ships until the Associated Governments come toa decision in the matter at the Peace  Conference, and thatwhile the report of the formation .of a &quot;Lloyd-Adriatico&quot; Lineis premature, foreign firms have been negotiating for thepurchase of, or interests in, enemy ships.

Agraio, cannot yet be recognised,                      BLACK SEA AND MARMORA     Unrestricted trade with Serbia and Rumania is now per-mitted, and the blockade of the Dardanelles is relaxed accord-ingly.   The Admiralty agrees to the raising of the blockade of Turkey, Bulgaria, Czecho-Slovakia and South Russian ports,and the. Allied Blockade Committee will decido as to thisshortly.     With reference to the repatriation of German troops,  theCommander;in Chief reports that one ship has sailed for Malta,and that the remainder are still at Constantinople pending adecision as to the port-of disembarkation.   He has taken upthree more ships and is fitting them as transports,   Theshipping therefore available for transporting enemy troops is sufficient for 15f400.   The estimated number is 26.500 made upof 9000 from the Constantinople area, 8000 from Nicolaief,1500 from Poti, and 3000 from Trans-Caspia.

Tlie French Government is not infavour of abolishing the system for Greece, but unices it is tobe applied to all countries,- there seems no reason for apply-ing it to Greece, nor is there any reason from the Blockadepoint of view...     M. Venezolos would like British Port Control abolished atall ports (including Piraeus) except Lemno-s, Imbros andTenedos, and should we agree to this, he will ask the: french to abandon their control at Corfu, and the Italians to evacuatetheir troops from that Island.
