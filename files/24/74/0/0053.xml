BRITISH NAVAL ASSISTANCE IN NORTH RUSSIA.            Admiralty Memorandum for the war Cabinet.          The requirements for British Naval assistance in north Russia cannot be considered to be affected by thedecision of the Peace Conference in Paris on 22nd January to invite Representatives of all Russian groups to meet theRepresentatives of the Allies on Prince1s Island in the sea of Harm or a.          The only event which could modify the ftaval require-ments would be the immediate and permanent cessation ofhostilities by the Bolsheviks.          Recent events in the Archangel area, where our military forces have been forced to retire,, give considerablecause for apprehension.   The Bolshevik forces appear to bewell organised, their numbers of men and of guns are increasing,,and their successes are likely to encourage them to pursue their offensive on this front.          Meanwhile the Allied Military forces are steadilydiminishing, and it is understood to have been decided thatno further Military re-infer cements are to be sent to north russia.          It is expected that the Dwina and Vaga Rivers willbe clear of ice in May, and it appears probable that theBolsheviks Will then make a determined effort to retakeArchangel with the assistance of their River Force of armedgunboats, which had been considerably developed towards theend st the last season of open river.          The situation will be the same if the Governmentdecides upon the evacuation of North&apos;Russia, and will call foreven more Naval assistance than in the case of an offensiveby us, since the population of the occupied territory will&apos; 1probably turn against us as soon as they realise that Bolshevikoccupation is impending, and the retirement will have to be conducted in large measure by water.          While, as has been stated, the Rivers are usually opento navigation in May, the approaches to Archangel are not free from ice until June or July.          There is therefore an interval during which theNaval assistance must depend solely on the forces now at archangel, before re;-inforcements  can arrive from England.          This had been foreseen by the Admiralty, and inaddition to the Monitore already at Archangel, four River Gun-boats were 3ent and arrived before the navigation closed.          It is necessary now, in order to avoid grave riskof disaster, to prepare and equip a considerable number ofcraft which should arrive at Murmansk in May, in readiness toproceed to Archangel immediately navigation opens.i  IfCraft/
            Craft  of  special natures are required.   In many  cases  they are now  actually available in England, but would  in  the ordinary^shortly be returned to their owners.    It  is  necessary  to  maintain the requisition of these craft, and  to  proceed at once  with their preparation for service.    In  other  cases the  craft were in various stages of construction,  but work has  been stopped and it is necessary to resume it  without delay.            The principal craft required are:-                  30  Tugs for towing barges,                  10  Steam Launches,                  50  Self propelled Barges,                  30  Steel Lighters,                  10  Troop-carrying small steamers,                  9    -do-        of specially light draught,                  6  Hospital Boats.            It  should be realised that the provision of these  craft  i3 necessary  whether the policy eventually decided upon  for North  Russia is an offensive  or an evacuation;- and that  the only case in which it would be superfluous is the cessation  of  all hostilities  with the Bolsheviks.    If such should  occur we shall have incurred some expense to no purpose, but  if  the hostilities  continue, we should risk a serious disaster  if  the provision asked for is not made.            War Cabinet authority is therefore asked for the  Admiralty  to make such provision as they consider necessary  for River  Operations next Spring and Summer in North Russia,  observing  that an immediate decision is required in order to  secure the vessels  now and to prepare and fit them for this,  special service  in  the time available.(Signed)   R.
