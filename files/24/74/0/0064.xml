KEELING.     Mr. Keeling is probably the last Englishman who has arrivedhere from Petrograd, having left there on January 9.   He  is amember of the Printers&apos; Trade Union in this country, and,  while inRussia, was a member of the Printing: Trade Union there.    Duringthe last year he has spent most of his time in Petrograd,  but during last summer and autumn he travelled extensively in  SovietRussia.   Having been&apos;received everywhere as a working man, hehas been brought into very close touch with the-real feeling ofthe workers, especially in Petrograd, and his observations aretherefore of peculiar interest.Working Classes in Petrograd.     During the last two months there has been an increasinglystrong feeling against the Bolsheviks amongst all classes  ofintelligent workingmen in Petrograd, Moscow and all other  centres..In the early clays of the Bolshevik Revolution practically  allthe Trades Unions were enthusiastic supporters oi the new  regimeas the Bolsheviks promised everything and the working men werekeen to try new experiments.   Latterly, however, it has become more and mor-  clear to them that the Bolsheviks&apos; experiments haveended in absolute failure, and it may be said that there is not asingle Trades Union left in Petrograd vtiich really supports the
present Govern,:!it.  .  Nominally,  ox  course,  trey remain Bolshe/ilcrjthat  is due to the fact  that  they do not  know what  oji--.. to c&quot;o.last  TvOT^december mejubcra  ox  the  Trades  Unions  were  forced to  sig.i  a paper answering two  questions: Are you  a  Communist,  or. are you in sympathy with the Communists?   In December the  coercionpractised by the Bolsheviks became still  more severe,  and  all theTrades Unions were again  forced  to sign a paper  merely answeringthe question &quot;Are you  a Communist?&quot;.      One factory may be quoted as  typical ox  practically allthe factories in Petrowrad.   At  the Synodalnaya there are atpresent 500 employees.    Originally  half  ox  them had. been  Bolsheviksbut the foreman told Mr.  Keelin.;.  that there  were now not more than3 genuine Bolsheviks out  ox the  whole staff.   They  had. to pretend that  they were Bolsheviks, as the Bolsheviks  had all the runs andammunition.   &quot;Everybody  is  sick  of  it,&quot;  said the foreman  ox  thefactory to Mr. Keeling,   &quot;We have to sin;n the paper saying we  areBolsheviks or we cannot live.   Why  don&apos;t the British  peoplecome  to help us?&quot;      In the Putilov and Obukhovsici works  practically everybodystruck just before Christmas, and cries were  heard of  &quot;Down withthe Bolsheviks&quot;.   In  these two works only half  ox the originalnumber of workers remain  and  they only  turn  out  10;&apos;.&apos;  of the originalamount of work.   The  Treugolnik  factory, the chief  rubberfactory in Petrograd,  only turns  out  15$  ox  the  original output..      Mr,  Heeling was acquainted \ith members  ox  the  staff  of  the&quot;lirasnaya Gazeta&quot; (Reel Gazette1&apos;), one  ox the chief  Bolshevikpapers in Petrograd.   Members of the staxf,  as,  for example,the chief photographer, told Mr. ICeeling  secretly that they were no more in sympathy with  the Bolsheviks than  he  was  himself,  butth.it  they had. to earn  a living somehow.
K JJ W     All factories are no\r under  the Soviet  of People&apos;s Economy,The Commissars are men who were not much  ;&quot;oocl at  their own xrork,as it is difficult to *et good men to  serve  at the factories  insuch a capacity.   In Petrograd one ox the Commissars in  a factory Came to Mr. ICeelin;; and asked him when the British were coming.   dr. ICeelin;  replied that he had no idea and knew no more than the Commissar himself,  whereupon the Commissar  said:&quot;I hope they will come soon, for  this position is. intolerable.Even though we are in the Soviet  we get no more to eat&quot;Conditions in the Villages.     Mr. Keeling travelled extensively throu h the country and made a special point c&apos;. raking enquiries  into the conditions  inthe villages he passed through.   When the Poverty committees were first set up by the Bolsheviks they  were chiefly composed ofthe riff-raff ox the villages, strengthened  by Bolsheviks fromthe towns, hut before long respectable peasants came to the con-clusion that it would be wiser to join the Poverty Committeesthemselves so as to exert their influence in them;   This has ledto a great change in the Committees themselves, and the Bolshevikare now very much disturbed at the lack of  control they have  overthe Committees and are making another efxort to centralise the  -work oi the Poverty Comrittees from Moscow.     Mi&apos;. Keeling said that vhen he was passiiv. throu; . theoountry districts last summer he noticed  that the.peasantrygenerally were very hostile to the English and in many oasestold him that ii the English tried to Invade their oountry theywould join the Bolshevi?:s against them.   When he asked them,  why they were hostile to the English  they replied in most cases thatit v/as because the Pnglish meant  to take  possession of Russia and take away from, them everything they had.   When he returned tothese districts a few months later he noticed a very remarkable
  change.   Instead of being hostile to the English the pa&amp;sants  said they would be only too pleased ii the Baglieh came andtp-, delivered them from the present appalling state of affairs.  They are prepared to accept any form of government which will  free them from the Bolshevik! and mako life again possible.       Mr. Keeling added that he had during the last few months  noticed a very strong revival of religious feeling.   At the  beginning of the Bolshevik Revolution people generally thought that  the Church was no longer necessary as the Bolsheviks obuld  provide them with everything.   It was only the women who still  clung to the Church,   The Bolsheviks, however, made a great-  mistake in their attempt to cfestroy the Church altogether,  and especially in the country the persecution and warder of  priests created an extremely bad impression.   In some cases  T&amp;ioh Mr. Keeling knew of himself priests had been murdered  by the Bolsheviks for refusing to remove the ikons from their  Churches.   Even in Petrograd the Churches are now being  attended by 1men almost as much as by women, and the priests  are becoming more and more bold in their denunciations o.r. the  Bolsheviks.   At Christmas time outside St. Isaac!s Cathedral  a priest addressed the people in a sermon in which he denounced  the Bolsheviks, and, much to the surprise o\ everybody, nothing  was done to him.   It was oommonly known that the Bolsheviks  had intended to prevent the celebration oi Christmas, but  when it came to the point they dl1 not dare to take any  steps in this direction.       To sum up:  Mr. Keeling&apos;s general conclusions were as  follows:       (1)  There Is g?.?owinc hostility to the Bolsheviks both in            the country &quot;and in the town3.       (2)  The Red Army is quite untrustworthy and could make
 iff                                                                 270     no stand against a woUndisciplined army.(5)   In ease Oi&quot; Allied intervention the Bolsheviks or,aid     not possibly arouse/any national reeling arainst the     invaders.(4)   The people generally are thinking less and less about     politics and are prepared to aocept any regime whioh     would save th.;m from the Bolsheviks.(5)   The Grerrhans-are still play in:  with Bolshevism in     Petrograd with the object of continuing the chaos    ;    -     in Eastern Europe until they feel themselves sufficiently :     strong to c^erihrow the Bolshevilcs and restore order them-.     selves;(6)   If the Allies denot intervene themselves the Germans certainly     will later on, and they -sill -be e&amp;tfcuil^laally received     by aiihost all. claeee.8.
