Dear Prime Minister,                 I  send  yfsu  the proposals for Land Settlement.                 The  Reconstruction  Committee on Land Acquisition,.      apptinted by the  Prime Minister in 1917, made  oertaln      recommendations whioh have &quot;been well received  not only by  suoh      bodies  as the  surveyors Institution, but by the Press,      including the  Westminster Gazette and the Daily kail.                 tot I  want is a Bill on those lines, applicable to      all acquisition of  land far public purposes,  i.e. not only land      settlement,  reclamation, and  afforestation, but railways,      schools,  htusing, etc.                 The  Lord  Chancellor is, I  believe,  in favour of  such      a Bill, and  I  should  like him to  introduce  it  in  the House of      Lords forthwith.                 The  standard of market-value  adopted is that of      price as between  a  willing  seller and a willing  buyer.   No      allowance is to be  added  to  value for oompulsory acquisition.      No increased value  fan be  claimed for special  adaptability.      Large  reductions  are  also proposed  in the  costs  and charges       of acquisition.                 It is not proposed to use  the valuation under the      Finance Act, 1909,  except  as evidence of value.    With this I       agree,  and think  that,  as  evidence,  tho valuation would be      most  useful.                 If a Bill on these general lines were  brought in and       carried, it  will  govern all  proceedings for compulsory      acquisition.   If no general legislation is proposed, then      Land  Settlement,  Housing,  and Railway,  as well as Water supply,      and Schools, will oach require speoial clauses in their       respective Bills.

112          $and Settlement fcr ex-Service men is a national duty,and the State must be prepared to bear a considerable pa?t of the initial coat.          No decision on the subject wae reached by the Governmenttill Dectmber 31, 1918.   But the extteae urgency of the question had baen pressed on the Cabinet by the pros!dent off thtf Board ofAgriculture in October, 1917, and again in two Memoranda in May,1918.   The abeence of any decision has hitherto prevented theBoard and the County Councils from taking definite action for th^acquisition of land.               (1)  PRgyABATIOHS,          She following preparations w*re made in 1916.  (l)  Notions w*r? issued In the Press (September 3) addreoeed       to glshe-owners, asking them to offer land for settlement       purposes.  (2)  Circulars were sent (September 13) to Trustees of Charitable       Lands and other public bodies, inviting offers of land.          The response to (l) and (2) has been considerable;   the       lend offered has been classified in counties and passed on       to County Councils.    Offers of 34,000 acres have been       received,   In some cases the land has-been surveyed,  and       either rejected or provisionally accepted.  (3)  Commissioners were sent round to interview leading members       of County Councils to stimulate their activity in securing       similar off en, pnd in notifying all land ooming into  tho       market or falling vacant.  (4)  $he Ecclesiastical Commissioners, at the rwquost of the       Board, have allowed their estates to be surveyed, with a       v$ew to seleoting suitable plots for settlement.   4,600       acres have already been selected for inspection, and the       work ia proceeding.  (5)  A Division of the Board has been formed to deal with Land       Settlement, divided into Branches, (a) Local Authorities;
    (B)  labftur  and  training;   (o)  aeleotion  of land;  (d) horticulture-    culture  and email live  stock;   (e)  supplies and &quot;buildings.    The  heads of these  Branches meet  once  or twics a  week to    complete their  preparations in consultation. (6)  The  staff of  men  in the  service of the Beard qualified to    report on the suitability  af land has  been strengthened, so    as to  admit of  rapid  action, as scon as  the Board or tho    County Councils are placed in  a position to acquire land. (7)  A  Bill has bean prepared by  the Board, amending the Small    Holdings Act, 1908, in details Which practical experience    proveB to be neoessary,  and carrying into effect  purchase  of    land for oash and for annuities. (8)  A  Commissioner is on the 7/estern  Front obtaining evidenoe    from Army Corps XV. as  to  the  number ef  men wishing t$  go  on    the  land\ the type  of holding  they  desire, their  experience    or inexperience, their command 6r laok of capital.  The    reeult will,  it is  hoped,  produOe a sample from which some    general  guide as to the extent of the  demand  may  be derived.     The Commissioners estimate is 135,000  men from  the Western    Front  alone. (9)  Tho  Board is  working  in  olose touch  with the War Agricultural    Committee on the Western Front, so  as  to secure to intending    settlers as much praotioal instruction in the industry  as    possible while  they still  remain in the  Army.  Booklets    containing  useful instructions have been prepared, and  havo    boen oirculatod to  the  men through  the Commandants of the    Agricultural Companies.(10)  An organisation has been sot up in suitable oountios  whioh    will be  available for giving instruction in horticulture,    fruit  growing,  and  the  minor industries  of agriculture*(11)  The  Board has called tho attention of  County Councils to the    farms  (20,000 aoros)  of which  they  aro now in possession under
114          the Defouoo of tho Realm Regulations,      (12)  Tho Board is in communication with tho v/ar Office and the          Directorate of Lands as to the suitability of any land in          their possession under, tho Acquisition of Lands Act.                    (2) PROBABLE.,,DiiSJlAm),SX)R LAND.           Tho demand for land, will probably come  from the following classes of men, who may be divided according to thoir experience ar inexperienoo.i,Men with previous experience of agriculture or horticulture.      (l)  Sons of small farmers who hitherto have lived with and             worked for their parents.    These men would be capable             of managing a holding up to 40 aores, and would             probably command s*me capital.      (2)  Agricultural labourers anxious to settle on holdings             sufficient in size to maintain themselves and their             families (as a rule not less than 20  aores), but             without capital.      (3)  Agricultural labourers partially disabled, who will             want small grass holdingo for a cow,  pigs, or pcultry             to supplement their penrions.      (4)  Agricultural labourers, net disabled, wishing to work             for wages in their own distriot, but  desirous of             obtaining some land, say % to   acre, with an untied             cottage.,Men without previous experience of agriculture cr horticulture.      (l)  Men, not disabled, whe prefer an open-air life to             sedentary occupations.      (2)  Men who for medical reasons desire to live in the             country.           I anticipate that the largest demand will be under A(3) and (4).   Between 280,000 and 300,000 agriculturists have joined the Services;  allowing for casualties, there are some 220,000 to be demobilised.   But agricultural labourers,  as a rule, are too familiar with farming difficulties to attempt to support themselves from land, unless it is exactly suitable in quality and situation. They will, therefore, prefer to supplement wages by tho profits of holdings, rather than to depend on holdings as their sole souroe cf livelihood.
115             (JT)   AGENCY FOR AO^TISXTIOK.          In order to meet the demand for land,  the Governmenthas to decide whether it will att centrally through the Board and war Executive Committees, or locally through the County Counoils,The Cave Committee agreed in the recommendation that the CountyCounoils would he the best instruments for the acquisition ofthe land required.          One argument in favour of this oourse is that themaohinery is alroRdy. to a large extent, on the Statute Boole andin familiar use.   3he present method ef acquiring land for smallholdings is that, if County Counoils are unable to acquire landby agreement on lease or at a purchase price which they areprepared to pay, they may make eompulsery orders for compulsory acquisition   If the Board of Agrioulture confirms the Order,it appoints the arbitrator, who determines the rent or thepurchase price.   The award is binding on the landowner, but theCounty Council, if dissatisfied, may withdraw.          In the case of allotments, Borough and Urban Distriotand Parish Councils are empowered to acquire lend for thepurpose on lease or by purchase, either by agreement orcompuleorily.   Parish Councils exercise compulsory powers only through County Councils.  The procedure for the compulsory acquisition of allotment land is similar to that in the caseof small holdings.          County Councils are already able to acquire land byagreement or compulsion, either on long lease or by purchase for cash.   Legislation has been also framed for purchase ofland for perpetual annuities charged upon the County rates.Zn the same Bill a provision is inserted enabling a CountyCouncil to acquire land and let it for allotments to a perishCouncil,
lis          So far as County Councils are concerned,  they will,  ifthe legislation is carried in respect of annuities,  be  able  toacquire land either by agreement cr ccmpulocrily -     (l)  6n lease for 35 years renewable at their  option;     (2)  by purchase for  cash;       and by voluntary purchase for annuities,  which could  be         used f-r the extinction of tithe rentcharge.          It is thought that the voluntary sale  of  land for  annuitieswill be adopted on a considerable scale by such  bodies  aa the ecclesiatical Commissioners, the Charity Commissioners, Hospitals,Schooio, Colleges, and glebe-owners.   The total amount of land  hellby these bodies exoeeds one million acres.          Annuities will also be, it is hoped, useful in cases wherelandowners desire to redeem the tithe rentcharge on their property.The County Councils v/ill be able to purchase the land on an  annuity,and Queen Anne*s Bounty, who receive the redemption maney forclerical tithe rentoharges, are prepared to accept  these annuitiesin lieu of tithe rentcharge.   A landowner will  thus be able toextinguish the clerical tithe rentcharge with the annuities  receivedfrom a County Council.   As such tithe rentoharges  are  payable inmeat of the agricultural districts, this power may  stimulate the offer of land in many parishes.          Holdings for ex-Service, men may also be. provided bylandowners.   They can supply land in small quantities more  immediatelycheaply, and effectively, than any public body.    They would-,  it isbelieved, be prepared to d. s^.   But they cannot be expected  todefray the whole cost, at present prices, of building cottages andadapting and equipping the land.   Acting en the report of the CaveCommittee as sanctioned by the Government, the Bill framed by  theBoard gives facilities similar to those conferred on County  CouncilBto landowners to borrow money for the purpose of cottage building,
117equipment, and adaptation.   Tc the loan would &quot;be attached specialoonditions requiring the landowner to obtain the approval of theBoard for the rente that are fixed, and to give to the tenantssecurity of tenure tn the principle of the Scottish Land Acts.          Land may also be provided through tho Board -  (l)  Under the Sailors and Soldiers (Gifts for Land Settlement)         Act, 1916.   Under this Act the Board ha3 been offered         approximately 1,000 aores at the presont time.  (2)  Under the Small Holdings Colonies Act,  1916.   Under this         Act the Board has acquired by purchase or long lease         5,838 acres.  (3)  Under the Small Holdings Colonies (Amendment) Aot, 1918.         Power is given to the Board under this Act to aquire         an additional 44,000 acres on lease or by purchase for         rentcharge, but not by purchase for cash.   1,726 aores         of land are being acquired under this Act at the present         moment.  (4)  Under reclamation schemes (G.T.6277),  for which the War         Cabinet has sanctioned an expenditure of one million         pounds.   Areas in Dorsetshire, Yorkshire, and North         Wales might be begun at an early date, but would not be         available for occupation before the following year.         The labour of German prisoners might be profitably         employed in read-making and clearing.  (5)  Under drainage schemes (C.223), for which the Board has         asked for a capital expenditure by the Government.         Here also the labour of German prisoners should be         employed.          It is difficult to estimate the amount cf land which mightwithin eighteen months be made available under (4) and (5), butit would&apos;probably amount to not less than 70,000 or 60,000 acres.          At present the Board has no direct power to buy landfor cash, and it is very desirable that it 3hculd have this power.   The Board is often in a position to negotiate onfavourable terms with large landowners, and it nay be foundnecessary to act in cases cf default of a County Council.   Itis also desirable that the Board,  if it cannot rent land cr buyit on a rentcharge, should be able to purchase land for cashon which to form groups of settlers under a Director, for training
118purposes or for immediate settlement.          The Bill framed &quot;by the Board provides the necessary powers in these respects.     (4)  REASONS K)R THE CHOICE ptff COUNTY COUNCILS AS AGflNTS.          The Board of Agriculture are satisfied that the worlc  of acquiring land, selecting the tenants and managing the holdings,must be decentralised, and that the best bodies for this purposeare the County Councils.   The Cave&apos;Committee arrived at the sameconclusion for the following reasons:-  (l)  The County Councils are already the statutory authorities     for the provision of small holdings under the Small     Holdings and Allotments Act, 1906.  (2)  They have had ten years&apos; experience of the work,  and the     small holdings they have created have, with few exceptions,     been remarkably successful.   The arrears of rent on the     200,000 acr^s which have bom acquired have been negligible     and tho work has beon dene at praotieally no cost either     to Imperial or local funds.  (3)  Th^y have been pressing the Board for the last two yearB     for permission to acquire land for the settlement of ex-     Service men, and it is due to the refusal of the  .  -Government     to allow borrowing during the War that land has mt been     already acquired.  (4)  The local knowledge cf the Councils will enable them to     acquire land more readily and more cheaply than it  could be     done by a Government official, and they arc in a far     better position to sift the applicants, select the  tenants     and manage the holdings.          The Board&apos;s decision on this question has been criticised in the Press on the ground that County council arereactionary bodies composed of landowners and farmers who arehostile to the small holdings movement.   In the Boards opinion,this belief is entirely mistaken.   County Councils ara  the mostdemocratically elected bodies in the country, and, if they do not represent public opinion, there will be an opportunity cfaltering their composition next March, when they will bere-elected.   Moreover, the Board have abundant evidence that theyare really anxious to provide land for all suitable applicants,
and that they feel a special obligation towards the men wholeft their counties for service in the Forces.   The onlyreason which in the past caused County Councils to hesitateabout providing small holdings was the fear that a heavy charge would be placed on the rates.   This fear has been removed by thedecision cf the   Government that the whole of the loss which must inevitably be incurred in creating small holdings under presentconditions will be borne by the Exchequer.   County Councils will,therefore, in effect be acting as the Board&apos;s agents, and atthe Board&apos;o expense;  and with the removal of any fear cf a charge on the rates there is no reason to expect from them any failure to carry out the policy cf the Government.          If County Councils were not employed fcr the local administration of the scheme, the only possible alternativeswould have been either that the Board should do the whole ofthe work thenselves, or that some other local bodies, such as theWar Agricultural Executive Comritteea, should be entrusted with it.   The first course would have meant tho appointment of anarmy of Government &quot;officials, which would have been mostunpopular.   We should lose the- benefit of the local knowledge and unpaid services cf the r/members  of&quot;the County Councils, andthe administration would be much more oostly and much less effective,   Moreover, the supersession of the County Councilswould be vigorously resisted in Parliament, and it is very doubtful if the necessary legislation could be passed.   Theother alternative is open tc still greater objections.   If thework is decentralised at all, it would be impossible to passover a popularly elected body, to whom Parliament has alreadyentrusted the work, in favour of ncminated Committees,responsible to nc constituents, who were set up fcr an entirely different purpose.   Moreover, the War Executive Committee are
composed of farmers to a much greater extent than the CountyCouncils, and it is difficult to imagine any &quot;bodies who  would&apos;beless sympathetic to the small holdings movement.          At the same time, the Board recognise that CountyCouncils will have to reoeive clear guidance and  definite instructions from headquarters, and that their administration mustbe closely watched and supervised.   The necessary organisation for this purpose is being established, and the Board have no intention of allowing any unnecessary delay in the provision ofland fcr suitable ex-Service men by any County Council.    TheSmall Holdings Act contains powers enabling the Board to act indefault of County Councils, and these powers will be exercisedif necessary.   In addition, the Board will, under the Bill nowbeing framed, as well as under the Small Holdings (Colonies)Acts, have power to take immediate action if the  County Councilsfail to satisfy all reasonable demands.          It has been stated in the Press that the policy of^establishing small holdings colonies has been abandoned, but thisis not the case.   It is true that the Board think that the mainresponsibility for providing small holdings should be placed onthe County Councils, instead of attempting to meet the whole ofthe demand for land by the establishment of colonies by the Boarddirect.   But this is because the majority of applicants for small holdings desire to obtain land  near their own homes and inthe districts they know, rather than  to be placed on a colony.in  some  other part of the  oountry.    Moreover, the word  &quot;colony&quot;seems to have unattractive associations for many of the nen.They regard  it as analogous  to  penal  or epileptic colonies, and consider that it involves  some  form of  institutional life,whereas  their principal desire  is to  become independent  cfcontrol  and  discipline.    At the  same time, the Board recognise the advantages of establishing  small  holdings  in group3 which
are sufficiently large to enable co-operative organisation to be developed and which will provide social life for thesettlers.   The County Councils have therefore been urged to acquire   large blocks of land in those, districts v/hich are specially suitable for snail holdings, and the Board themselveswill acquire more land for the group or communal holdings ifthe  demand justifies it.   The system offers specialadvantages to men who want to start in a small way.   They can  got the benefit of advice and instruction from the Directors;  theycan obtain help in the cultivation of their land by hiring thehorses, implements, etc, on the central farm;  they can make useof the co-operative organisation for the purchase of their requirements and the sale of their produce;  and they will haveopportunities of earning money by working in their spare time  ontht; central farm.           (5)  TRAINING OF IHSXP^RI^NCI^ Wl.        There remains the very important question of how thesemen whe have had no previous experience in either Agriculture  orHorticulture may be trained for the industry with a reasonable prospect of success.   Plans have already been put forward for  thetraining of officers.   A section of the Board has born formed todeal with the subject generally.   Steps have been taken to organise,with the assistance of the War Office, preliminary training in agricultural operations on tho Western Pront prior tc domobiliaa-tion.   In this country it will bo supplemented by work on reclamationwhich  is, in its later stages, of the nature  of agriculturaltraining, by groups collected on farms owned and directed by the beard  cr on lands on which War Executive CommittoeB have entered ,,and Vy the cultivation of the lands attached to some  of the trainingcamps, where large numbers cf men could be trained in agriculturalopt rations, as well as instructed in  the principles of the  industry.
the Board is also re-opening some of its tractor and ploughingschools.   Steps are also being taken to place men with individualfarmers or market gardeners fcr training.   For this purpose it isessential that the cadres of the Agricultural Companies should be temporarily maintained.   For the same reason certain of the trainingcamps, with their hutments, and canteens, and land, should be kept inexistence.   On both points, the Board are in communication with theWar Office.   The training period for unskilled men should be long enough to give them every reasonable prospect of success.   It willalso  serve as a test of the genuineness of the man&apos;s desire for an agricultural life.   The first three months of training will be in thenature of apprenticeship.   During this period it will be necessaryto pay to farmers some portion of the minimum wage which they willbe required to pay  to  the men.          For all the  small agricultural  industries suoh asgardening, poultry  or  rabbit-keeping, an  organisation 1ms been  setup in almost all the suitable districts of the  country, which will  .enable men to receive  a  certain  amount  of instruction and training,and direction.                     (6)  CREDIT  FACILITIES.          The provision  of credit  facilities  which will  enable tenants  to  start  their industry  successfully  is important.    InI all  the  schemes  of  the Dominions,  credit  forms a considerable feature.   But  the  problem is  easier,  because there is  the  security of the  allotment of land.   .1           The existing scheme  cf agricultural credit  in thisjcountry, which  has  been  in operation for the  past two  years,I operates through local banks with a State guarantee.    It has not been largely used;   not  much mere than  30,000 has been advanced, and the Ions upon thia sum has net greatly exceeded  40,   A State guarantee to  the banks would probably afford the simplest                                 11.
means of providing credit, but credit facilities may sometime8be best afforded through remitting or suspending rent for twoor three years, and it is undesirable, in the opinion of the beard, that in the majority af small loans credit should be givenin tho form of cash.   It should rather be in the form of livestock, implements, eerde, fertilisers, etc          There will be a numb r of applicants for small holdingswho are well qualified by experience and personal capacity, but who have not euffioient capital to stock their holdings and providefor working expenses during the first year or two.   In suchcases the Board proposes that County Councils should be empoweredto advance loans up to an amount net exceeding the amount ofcapital in cash, stock or implements possessed by the applicanthimself.   For instance, if a man had  100 of his own, he mightobtain a loan cf  100 in addition, so aB to provide him with sufficient capital for a holding of 16 acres at the rate of  12an acre.    Such loans would be repayable within a short period,say 7 years, the annual repayments being collected with the rentcf the holding after the first year.   The Board do not considerthat a man with no capital of his own can expect to be financedand provided with a holding at the coot of the State.   A con-sidcrable number of ex-Servico men will have some capital in the form of t&amp;e gratuity payable to them on demobilisation.                     (7)  ERICH OF LAS).          There is the supremely important question of the price to be paid for land required for settl m nt purposes.   It hasbeen contended in the Press that th re is grave danger that landmay be purchased at excessive priceo and that consequently the rents of these small holdings will be prohibitive.   But the pricepaid fcr the land is not the real difficulty.   It is the high
eoat of adaptation which will at present make it ImpoBsioio to charge sufficient rents to recoup tho outlay, and the CountyCouncils will therefore fix the rents on the basis of what Gheholdings are worth and not on what they have oost, the differencebeing paid by the State. -  From the point of view of the State itis, of oourse, essential that the price to be paid for the land should be reasonable, and tho real difficulty is to settle thestandard of what is a reasonable prioe.   It is oontended by somethat the Government and Local Authorities should be empowered toaoquire land at the pre-war value;  T*ut it is difficult to see how this could be justified or how the pre-war value oould be ascertained.   As to the valuation made by the Inland Revenueunder the Finance Act 1909, I have seen the Chief Land Valuer,who states that &quot;total values&quot; of agricultural land are uselessas the basis of land purchase.   j&amp;oreover, much land has been sold several times over sinoe the war began, and to take it fromthe present owners at prices considerably IOSB than they paid for it only a year or so ago would be rightly regarded asconfiscation.   tt is true that the prioe of the better quality of land has risen considerably, perhaps 20^;  but  itB value forcultivation has also risen.   Juost of the purchasers ofagricultural land during the last two years have bought it inorder to cultivate it themselves, and they paid the price  theydid because they thought they could make a profit  by itscultivation.   If the state now requires it, also  for cultivationpurposes, it  is difficult to see why they should pay a less price.A good deal of the land which County Councils acquire for  smallholdings will be purchased a  public auction, and  the price which land fetches at auction is  a fairly good  indication  of  itsmarket value.   The  Board intend  to  exercise close supervision over all proposals for  tjie aoquisition  of land by  County Counoils,and they will refuse to sanction  purchases at prices whioh in
their opinion are in excess of the market value.   But  suggestions that land should he acquired at less than the present market valueraises great difficulties, and are inconsistent with tho JSlectionmanifosto and speeches of the Government.   If loss than market value is to he paid, how much less?  how is the prioe to heascertained?  and how is the proposal to he justified?          I do not propose in the Band Settlement Bill  to deal withthis question of the basis of compensation for the following reasons -     (1)  The existing procedure of arbitration for ascertaining  compensation for land taken for small holdings has as a general  rule not resulted in extravagant awards.     (2)  Prom inquiries I have made of Looal Authorities and  others, I think the present ptfice of land, though higher than  before the war, will not hamper land settlement, as the present  prices of agricultural produce should enable correspondingly high  rents to be obtained.     (3)  I agree with the view expressed in the Second Report of  the Committee dealing with the Acquisition and Valuation of  Land for public purposes (Cd. 9229),. that the Lands Clauses Acts,  even with the amendments in the Small Holdings and Allotments  Act, 1908, are not satisfactory and should be replaced by a new  Code, but to embody such a proposal in the Land Settlement Bill .  would overweigh the Bill and hampor its progress.   Further, I  think that the amendment of the law in this respect should bo of  general application for all public purposes, and I suggest that  the Lord Chancellor might be asked to bring in a Bill for this  purpose.                &apos; W  THB PROPOSED LAKP SBTTL&amp;ffKT BILL,            The following are the principal proposals in the Land  Settlement Bill now in course of preparation -     (1)  The County Council should remain the body primarily
responsible for providing land, subject to action by theSmall Holdings Commissioners if tho Councils default.  a council should bo required to constitute an AgriculturalCouncil with sub-o omit toes possessing oxooutivo powers to dealwith small holdings and tho other agricultural functions of a council.   The constitution of the Committee and sub-committeeBtc be the subject of a scheme approved by the Board on the linesof the Education Aot, 1902, and t* comprise at least one nomineeof the Board.   (2)  For two years Councils should be authorised to make orders for compulsory acquisititn without the present requirement of th..&apos;ir confirmation by tho Board.   This will enableimmediate entry on land and  save a d^lay ef at     l^ast threemonths,   (3)  The arrangement sanctioned by the Cabinet whichguarantees Councils ftr six y^ars against any less *n smallholdings will remove the main  obstacle to action by CountyCouncils.   (4)  For two years thv, existing prohibition of acquisiti-n ofland unless it can b^- let at rentB t^ oover the cost will be suspended.   This is neoessary, as tho cost cf adaptation willbe very high.   At thv. end cf  the six years&apos; guarantee th*; state will valu.; the small holdings  and mak- g*^d t* the Councils thedifference between their value and oost.   (5)  Landowners can adapt land f*r settlement more speedilyand generally at less c-st than local auth-rities.   They shouldtheref-.ro bo encouraged during the n:xt tw-^ years t- do  so both as regards small h-ldings and  cottages with one aero t&quot;  half anacre by a o:.ntributi-n by the  State  -f the difference betweenthe c:.8t of adaptation and the consequent increase in value.  Allholdings sc provided tr- be subject f*r at least ten years topr-visions securing fair rent  and fixity  cf tenure rn the lines                         15,
  of the Scottish Land Acts.     (6)  For two years the Board should frr reclamation, drainage,  and afforestation, have tho same powers cf prompt acquisition of  land as are giv^n to Cunty Councils.   If the; 60,000 acres  authorised t;. &quot;be aoquircd f :r small holdings colonies undor the  Small HoldingB Colonies Aots 1916, 1918, oannr-t bo obtained                                                           i                                                           i  voluntarily, tho compulsory provisions should apply and payment  in cash be auth. risod.     (?)  Tho Bill will provide f^r voluntary purohase for County  Council annuities.   If thuso give a return slightly highor than  C ns-ls, this arrangement should prove acceptable to corporations I  such as Ecolesiastical C-mmisei nors, Colleges, incun&amp;onts, etc.     (8)  Assistance in live-stock, seeds, manures, etc, will have-  to bo given tr cx-Svrvioo nu-n and to women whi havo enrolled for  land wrk during tho war.     (9)  Some amendments will be necessary to facilitate provisian  of allotments.          I think the great demand will be ftr untied cottageswith one acre&apos; to, half an acre.   This  is striotly a housing matter for the Local Government Board, but so linked with the settlementprogramme as regards rural areas that  the Bill should cover theGovernment housing proposals.   The previsions a8 to promptacquisition of land are equally applicable to housing.   I am in communication with the Local Government Board on this point.                                          R. a.
