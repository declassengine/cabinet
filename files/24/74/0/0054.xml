Jets document  is  the  pnomTx M ^s britannic maj^styis ^ov&amp;mmm).WAR ..CABI2CT.1                       A    ISTRY......QOMlAROHi             f Memorandum by the UndeSj^o r e t ary of Btate f or Air) ^             I have carefully considered the question cf the organisa-     tion that should be maintained in peace time for Invention and     Research;             Before the war each of the great Spending Departments     had its own Invention Branch,  whioh considered any invention     submitted to it solely from its own point of view.  During the     war the whole question cf Invention and Research was centralised     under one Department which was under my control at the Ministry     cf Munitions.             There is great danger that,  with the disintegration     of this Department, the Government participation in Invention     .and Research will be allowed to relapse into the same condition     of rather narrow conservatiam as before the war.  One of the     facts brought to light by the war is that almost anything can     be invented, provided that the need for it is great enough and     the inventive brains of the country are sufficiently eonoentra-     ted upon it.             A great many most important ideas which have been     evolved through the War, and are partially developed, ought     undoubtedly to be followed out to their logical conclusion, bub     may quite easily be dropped.  An instance is the project of     giving greatly increased mobility to the fighting Divisions -     and rapidity cf movement is vital to suceess in war - by the     development of tanks and cross-country tractors.  It would be     a great disaster if progress in the Navy, Army or Air were     retarded, especially at the present time, by faulty organisation     of research.             A research Department, capable of meeting our present     needs must have the following qualifications ;-         (l) It must not be split up into small independent Sections -     at the Admiralty, War Office,  Air Ministry, etc. as was the case.     before the war,  It is evident that waste of power and delay,     must be the result cf such an arrangement.  On the other hand.     it must be  represented in each. Department so as to be in constant     close tench with their requirements and&apos;&apos;wife their technical     &quot;officers.         (2) It must have sufficient status&apos; to carry out its work     effectively and independently.  Considerable pewer of expendi-     ture must be given it if action is to be taken with promptness-     and secrey,   i       ,  As  regards the organisation required, I recommend  the   I formation of a research Ministry, with a Council which would     include senior representatives of the Navy,- Army and Air     Services.  These officers though they would belong to theI    Ministry cf Research would be members  of the Board of Admiralty,*)   the Army Council and- the Air Council,  and should thus be in     the closest touch with the Department  to which they are affiliated.     It might also be desirable to include  a representative of  the     post office.             The report of a Committee which was considered by  the     War Council on 15,1.19 recommenced the creation of a Commission     to deal with Rewards to Inventors with power to make awards up     to  .5,000 to any one Inventor.  A alight extension cf. this s.....EC R 33 TG..To 6753,y
principle to cover the expenditure by the Ministry of asimilar sum on the Development or purchase of an inventionwould give it the necessary financial powers..     If it were decided that it was undesirable to form anew Ministry it might  be possiblo to create a similar organ-i sat ion for Research under tho Ministry of Supply,, withoutthe necessity cf forming a now Ministry, if tho organisationof tho Ministry cf Supply were such that it could be adapted to Include rosoaroh, i..o.., if it contained a Board ,of repro-sortativos of the lluvy, Army and Air Sorvioos with a statussimilar tc that described above under whom a Eesearoh De-partment might work side b; side with the Contracts department in this case the responsibility for research would rent witha Controller General instead of a Minister..  I personal7/attach so much importance to the nood for -emphasising Ro-search that I should recommond tho formation of a Ministry.-     The above suggestions for the organisation&apos;,of theEeseagoh itopartment are tentative.  Tho object of this paper is primarily to urge that the encouragement of Hesearch is at the present time- especially vital to ths efficiency of theServices, and that unless vigorous action is taken, there isdanger that research will die down, and that like other vic-torious countries wc shall lapse into a state of complacentinactivity.                         -  (Signed)- J.JB-.B...
