POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE  DEPARTMENT,                             FOREIGN OFFICE]                                        GERMANY/033.0*                   MEMORANDUM       THE  INNER  CHANGE IN GERMANY.                                 SUMMARY.    1. This memorandum  examines, in  the light of data furnished by the  german press  and  German periodical literature, what truth there  is in  current assertionsthat &quot;there has been  no real  change in Germany,&quot; that &quot; the revolution  is a  meremask,&quot; that &quot; there is no shadow of repentance.&quot;    2. Two questions  must be distinguished:  (1)  Has a change  taken  place in thepolitical ideals of the  German people ?  (2) If so, does this  political change imply achange in moral  judgment?   With regard to question  (1),  Germany  is  really in process of becoming democratic, because the power has passed  to  a set of men whohave always believed in democracy.    3  The  change is not in the first  instance a conversion of  individuals  but atransference of the  directing  power.   Yet  a mass of individuals  also have been ledto change their beliefs or their professions.    4. Quotations as to the haste with  which multitudes repudiated their  allegiance tothe  old system.    5. In many people the shock of  defeat really did produce a  break-up  of  theirpreconceived ideas ;  quotations.    6. Revival of the tradition of 1848.    7. Many, perhaps the  majority  of, Germans, still  at heart monarchic, who willnevertheless accommodate themselves to a republic.    8. The discredit brought on the Hohenzollern dynasty by the Kaiser&apos;s flight makes a restoration of the dynasty in Prussia impossible, and, unless monarchy is restored inPrussia, it cannot be restored in the rest of Germany.    9. In any  case the German  people is determined to have popular democratic government, whether under the forms  of a limited monarchy  or of a republic.    10.  The. psychological, ground for  the  idea that  there has been &quot; no change &quot; isthat democracy was regarded as a  panacea, for all  moral  evil.   Now, therefore,that Germany has become democratic and  various changes in her attitude which had.been regarded as essential concomitants of democracy have not  appeared, some people are  disposed to deny that any change has taken place at all, instead of revising  theirown presupposition with regard to the sovereign? virtues of  democracy.    11.  Does the political  change to democracy imply, in Germany&apos;s case, a change inmoral judgment ?   So far, we can at  any rate  say that the  Socialists in power navealways denounced  the old regime&apos;s &quot; policy of violence &quot; (&quot; Gewaltpolitik &quot;).  A changewithin a country which consists in the abandonment of &quot; Gewaltpolitik &quot;  for ideals ofinternational goodwill and human solidarity is a change having  moral quality.    12.  The charge which may be brought  against the German Majority Socialists, inrespect of their conduct during  the war, is not that they expressed approval&apos;of thenational imperialism, but that they took the line of weakness  and compromise.  their defence was that Only by a German victory could the territorial  status quo of July 1914be maintained.    13.  Reasons for thinking it likely that the Socialists, in a future German republicwould adhere more firmly to their professed principles.    14.  Quotations  from non-Socialist democratic writers  admitting the  accusation of&quot; militarism &quot; against the former Government    15.  Admissions as to what Germany&apos;s conduct would have  been in the  event of aGerman victory.      [1012]                                                          B1
    16. The idea of building up a new world-power repudiated.  -  17. It is true that to-day there is a general refusal  in  Germany to  admit thatGermany bears any exclusive or predominant guilt for the origination of the war andthe manner of conducting it.    J8. A share-in-the-guilt (&quot; Mitschuld&quot;)  is  admitted, and individuals  urged  toexamine themselves as to their own personal share.    19. It is important to distinguish beliefs as to general principles and beliefs as to matters of fact.  Germany does not yet believe that the facts were what we allege.    20. Until the true facts  are  recognised in Germany, relations between Germanyand the rest of the world  cannot be satisfactory.   During the war the facts were hidfrom the  German  public by an  opaque wall of  censorship, or a distorting medium offalse suggestion.   Reasons for hoping that the true facts will in consequence of therevolution become known.    21. Charge against the present Government that it is the old militarism in disguiseis derived from German Bolshevik sources, for which any Government which attempted to put down mob-rule would be &quot; militarist.&quot;    22. Danger to the present  regime from general mental  unsettlement.  A greatdeal depends upon how soon the  distribution of food can be  regulated and regularindustry restarted.    1. In view of the assertions which are still common that &quot; There has been no realchange in Germany,&quot; that &quot;The revolution is a mere mask,&quot; that &quot; There is no shadowof repentance,&quot; &amp;c, it seems  worth while to examine some of the evidence on thissubject furnished by  the  broad  facts of the situation, and  by the German daily andperiodical press.  As to the latter kind of evidence, it might be  contended that the impressions of individuals who have recently  visited Germany are  surer  data  thanthe presentation of things  in the German press.   This, however, is not altogether true.Whilst the evidence derived from the press no doubt requires to be supplemented byother  lines of enquiry, it has to be remembered that the  press  both reflects extensiveelements in popular opinion, and has itself a great part  in making that opinion.  the impressions of a traveller may be  coloured by  his  personal  idiosyncrasies and the chance which  determines what  particular  individuals  he  meets.   The number  of individuals with whom any one traveller converses will in any  case-be much smaller than the&apos;public served by  the principal newspapers and periodicals..    2. In  examining the current  assertions  we  have  to distinguish  two differentquestions : (1)  Has a real  change  taken place in the political ideals  of the Germanpeople ?  And (2)  If so, does this political change imply a change in moral judgment?    One may say at once that to answer the first  of these questions in the negative isto be  blind to the broadest  facts of the  situation.   Germany  is  about to  become a democratic country in the fullest sense of the  word, unless the  process, now going through,  is disturbed  prematurely  by a  reactionary  counter-revolution,  or  by aBolshevist movement which destroys democracy in favour of a &quot; dictatorship  of theproletariat.&quot;   The party for the time being in power-the Social Democrat party arenot recent converts to a  belief in republicanism and democracy.  They stood for these things long before the war, and, so far as their professed ideals went, throughout thewar.  The difference  to-day is that the party  which before  was prevented by the superior power of the  ruling class from realising its programme has now got  the power in its  hands or at any rate such power as it is possible  for  any Government  to  have,at a moment  when there are large anarchic  elements  in  the country (such as the masses of soldiers without occupation and workmen  unwilling  to  work) over whomthe Government has only a shadowy control.                                      J    3. Even if in the class which has riches and academic education there are numberjwho remain still to-day attached in heart to the  old form of the State, the  important point  is that it is no longer by this class that  the  German State is directed.  Tilchange in  Germany is  not, in the first  instance, a  change of heart in individuals]but a transference of the directing power  from one set of men to another.   Yejeven in the  case of individuals, between the group of obdurate reactionaries and thegroup of those who are democrats  by old conviction there is  a mass of men whose!views fluctuate according to the  circumstances  of the hour,  and of these a  large&apos;number,  probably,  have been carried by recent events from  a  belief in  autocracyto a belief  in  democracy.   And  in this body we should  have to  distinguish a great variety of shades between  those, at one extremity, converted in the  most genuine sense.
and those whose assumption of the democratic character is an insincere accomodation to fashion or convenience.    4. The  indecent haste with which multitudes repudiated their allegiance to theold system, as soon as it fell, provoked bitter comment in Germany.         &quot;Since the  days of the revolution hardly any  voice  is  lifted, however    modestly,  in favour  of the old  Prussia.    What  has happened  to  all  those    who a  few months ago made such proud and often  injurious  parade of  their    Prussianhoocl, and who were sure that  this State  of theirs  would -stand firm and    unshakable in the  fiercest storms?  Is their sorrow, their shame, so  deep that    they can no longer  find a single  word of deprecation,  of  defence, against  a    criticism which shoots beyond every reasonable mark ? &quot;         (Friedrich Thimme, Librarian of  the Prussian Upper House, in &quot; Deutsche             Politik &quot; for the 22nd November, p.  1479.)         &quot;Is it dignified,  when  the  &quot; Kreuz-Zeitung,&quot;  forty-eight  hours  after the    revolution, jettisons the motto round the cross, to which it  owes  its name, &quot; With    God for King and Fatherland?&quot;  Is it not  pitiful to see  the red flags waving    on  the  hotels of the imperial capital ?  Do  we not  see  people  who, during the    war, even  if it  did  not bring them to the battlefield, amassed  a  fine collection    of orders and decorations,  as the representatives of the  various war  charities,    now pose  as fiery  convinced republicans ? .... It  is bitterly hard  to  digest    the fact that those who for four years on end identified themselves with a policy    based upon our  hope of victory, who advocated unrestricted submarine warfare,    who remained for long during  the war  in  the  Pan-German League,  now try    to  stab  in the  back those  who  stood for the  same views, and act as if they    themselves never had had any other ideas except their present short-sighted ones.&quot;         (Gustav Stresemann, the National  Liberal industrial magnate, in &quot;Deutsche             Stimmen &quot; for the 1st December, p.  788.)         &quot; Without  a greater degree of clearness as  to  what  precisely &apos; democracy &apos;    means,  I should  be  loth to join the  great  democratic trumpeting which now    resounds from every corner  of Germany, all the more  so because  in the society    which immediately after the revolution hastened to disclose its democratic  heart,    quite a  number of somewhat doubtful masks, so  far as the present phase goes, are    mingling in the ferment.            (Paul Rohrbach in &quot; Deutsche  Politik &quot;  for the  6th  December, p. 1539.)    5. Even if, however,  a  large number of  people take up the democratic cryin order to be in the fashion, the fashion  could hardly have been started unless  therewere a powerful body of sincere  believers in democracy.  Hypocrisy, to be  plausible,implies  the  real existence somewhere of the type  which  it counterfeits.   It  seemsindubitable  that the change which has  taken  place  in  Germany is real  and   vast.The power  has come into the hands  of those who  always  believed  in democratic government, and a great mass of men, witnessing the frightful  catastrophe  to whichthe old policy has led, turn to the democratic standard as to  the one hope.    The collapse of Germany shattered  in the great majority of Germans a  whole system of beliefs which had been up till then an essential part of their being, and theshock weakened the hold of all other preconceived beliefs upon  them.  They were ina state to doubt everything which had  seemed to  them true.  Under, such conditions it is easy to  understand that in many  a genuine change of political ideals took place.         &quot; The war  has  not only shattered  the  external  framework,  changed  the    distribution of power in the world, shaken the  social  and economic order  to its    base, but  raised afresh those questions  which  concern the inner life.   For the    moment we are still wholly absorbed by the actual process  of collapse and break-    up, of establishment  and reconstruction, in the outside world.  But all the time    we have the feeling that within us, too, there are roots being torn up, that the air    is full of questionings, that the depths have become more obscure, a vague feeling    of giddiness, longing, privation,  urgent demand, far-off promise. .... Does it    not seem as if we should have to  relay, reconquer, fortify  in some new way, all    the deepest foundations of our life ? And if we look round and let the most honest,    the most ardent  utterances of the time speak to  us, we are aware of a passion of.    -search,  still without  aim and without direction, hut springing from  an urgent
    inner necessity.   What honest man can pretend to co-ordinate intelligently and    peaceably within the framework of his preconceived belief all the impulses, aims,    duties, and deeds of this rushing time ? . .         &quot; Over  this  agitated earth there  is no  clear vault  of sky.  A battle of  the    spirits is going on in the air above-humanity, nation, brotherhood, home, reason,,    sacrifice,  heroism,  justice,  freedom,  power,  love,  honour so  many different    ideals, so many profound clashings and contradictions, and no phrases drawn from    the traditional stock can  enable us  to surmount them.&quot;                     (Gertrud Baumer in &quot;Die  Hilfe,&quot; for 14th November, p. 544).         &quot;Hundreds of  thousands of people are still halting  in doubt whether to join    in the march towards Socialism or stand fast with the bourgeois parties.  Hearing    the war-cry  &apos; SocialDemocraey versus Bourgeoisie1 that certainly is the form  in    which &apos; Vorwarts&apos; would give forth the war-cry many may come to suppose that the    concentration of the bourgeoisie is determined  simply  by the motive of protecting    capital.  Such   people may  easily  be  driven  by  the demagogic methods  of    campaigning into the opposite camp.&quot;           (Gustav Stresemann in &quot;Deutsche Stimmen&quot;  for 1st  December, p. 786).    There has unquestionably been a  conversion of  the  German, people to the  idealsof democracy in the sense  that the party which upheld  such ideals has becomedominant in  the country,  and  that large masses  of people,  opposed  before  thecatastrophe to democracy, have changed round to desire it or  profess to desire it.    In. &quot; Die Hilfe &quot;  for 5th December (p. 583), Friedrich Naumann wrote :          &quot; In the case of a good number of young people, and even of some older men    and  women, the  emotion  uppermost  at  the moment is  a kind of sanguine    exhilaration, which  we welcome, since  it facilitates the  transition to new things.    When one does what has to be done  it is best  to do it with a glad heart.  The    optimism in question arises from our newly-won political  freedom.  One can feel,    in dealing with  these people, what a  sense  of well-being it gives them to have    escaped  from  the old compulsion.  Even  with  individuals, who were formerly    shining examples of dynastic loyalty (&quot; Kooigstreue &quot;), one may sometimes  detect    in them a real feeling of relief, now that their life no longer goes on monarchic    lines.  If in the case of some of them we have only  external conformity, in that    of&apos; many others  a development which had  already proceeded  some Avay  Avithin    them has reached completion.  They feel happy at having rallied to the type  of    democratic man.&quot;    6. It must be remembered that&apos; there were  memories in the back of the Germanmind  which gave  a  hold to  the democratic idea ; .it was not something wholly alien.Over and over again  during the last weeks the idea has been uttered that Germany isnow resuming the movement broken off untimely after the revolution of 1.818.         &quot; Only  a week ago  it [the  National Constituent  Assembly] seemed   to all    responsible people an impossibility, for what it means is  that  the things which we    hitherto held sacred and eternal everything, frontiers, national existence, political    constitution-become matters of question and discussion.  The National Assembly    makes us once more  a  &quot;natural people&quot; (in the  18th-century sense of the term.)     a people that makes a wholly fresh start, taking its  destiny into its  own hands-    and determining its form.  By the convocation of the National Assembly,  which    will terminate the war carried on  by the German  Empire  and endured by the    German  people, and lay the foundations for a  new  future, the  whole political    history  of the time  from  1848 to 1914  is  wiped  out!  .... The National    Assembly of the  German  people in  1918  [? 1919J  is a continuation  of the    Parliament of the Paulskirche.&quot;              (Walther Schotte in &quot; Deutsche Politik&quot; for 15th November, p. 1446).         &quot; We must hoist the old flags and colours of the first romantic German  dream    of freedom,  for our task  is to link on again  German history to  the work of .1848.   - That is not difficult for  one whose youth was steeped  in  democratic memories    from  the year  of storm he  has  only to turn  over the pages of his childish    copybooks.....                                       -         &quot; In these days we must read Freiligrath [the revolutionary poet of the early
     19th century] and draw upon his passion  to give colour to the unfamiliar phrase     &apos; German Republic&apos; &quot;     -   ; .         (Theodor Heuss, &quot;Deutsche Politik&quot;  for 22nd November, pp. 1475, 1477).     In many men no doubt  the democratic tradition, although overlaid by the newJsentiments which attached to  the Empire created by Bismarck, had retained a latent vitality.   The case of Wilhelm Heile, who collaborates with Naumann in the editorship of &quot; Die Hilfe,&quot; is interesting:          &quot; For my part, so long as I have been  able to think, I have always been a     convinced republican, but I.had honourably made  my peace with the  idea of a     monarchy tempered by the constitutional limitations for which England  furnishes     the pattern.  Hence I held Naumann&apos;s conception of a union of democracy with     monarchy to be the happiest solution possible under the  special  conditions of     Germany.   For this reason I could now were it possible to forget for a niomenjt     the darkness of the hour,  to forget that the turn of events has sealed the final loss     of the war-1 could now exult from the bottom of my  heart at the fulfilment (such     as  I  had always longed  for,  but ceased to  expect) of my fairest  and boldest     youthful dreams.&quot;                                     (&quot; Die Hilfe &quot; for 14th November, 9, p. 543).     7. At a time when  great changes are taking place in men&apos;s thoughts, and various emotions contend for the mastery in them, the extent to which sentiments of attachment to the old dynasties or the monarchic idea still prevail in the general bewilderment and anxiety  must be  very doubtful.  To suppose that  all  the old sentiments of attachment have  ceased to exist would, of course, be absurd.  Just as many people, who before the  days  of  Bismarck were republican  in sentiment,  accommodated themselves, like Heile, to the imperial regime, so, wTe may be sure, multitudes would accommodate  themselves  to  a German  republic  without  losing  all  their  inner attachment to the old dynasties.  The account  of things  given by Paul Rohrbach may be  noted, though one has  to remember that Rohrbach,  having been the exponent of ambitious schemes of  German Weltpolitih, which would meet  with  little sympathyfrom a Socialist Government,  may be  to some extent prejudiced in his  estimates of popular feeling.         &quot;If it were possible  to get an answer to the  question  to-day,  whether the    majority of the German  people  is monarchic or republican in sentiment,  the    result  of the enquiry would  be in favour of the monarchic idea.   And in this    respect, there would be little difference between Prussia and South Germany.   In    Prussia itself the Eastern districts are, generally speaking, more conservative in    feeling than  the West, but even  in the West one would hardly find a majority    consciously republican. Nevertheless it is impossible to suppose that the  fallen    monarchy can ever  be restored.   It could not be restored in Prussia, and therefore    not in the other federal states,  nor in the realm as a whole.&quot;                                       (&quot; Die Hilfe &quot;  for 21st November, p. 557).    8. Rohrbach. goes on  to point out that the reason why it could not be restored in Prussia is that by a historical accident at the critical moment the house of Hohenzollern lacks any representative who commands public respect   So far as the ex-Kaiser goes, it is plain that his flight to Holland has largely caused  the feelings  of loyalty which bad been felt towards  his person to  give place  to  bitter contempt.   &quot;Vorwarts,&quot; 30th November),  quotes the utterances of Dr. Steiniger,  a champion of the monarchic idea, in &quot; Der Tag,&quot; to show how even in conservative circles the  action of  William II. is regarded:         &quot; No words can be severe enough for the mode of  the Kaiser&apos;s departure.    His action was unkingly,  unsoldierlike, unmanly, and of a kind to deal a mortal    blow to the dynasty and the monarchic idea.  No monarch has the right to act as    he has done.  No monarch may run away from his office like a schoolboy, leave    his soldiers and officials exposed without  any guiding star to the most  poignant    conflicts of soul and conscience, and drive the ship of State without a leader into a    wild sea least of all in the gravest hours of a world war.  One who has to repre-    sent a past of 500 years, rich in successes and memories, like the last Hohenzollern,    commits by such conduct an inexpiable sin against his dynasty and his people.   If    he believed it no longer possible for him to maintain himself amongst his troops,      [1012]                                                            C
     there was sufficient opportunity afforded him at the front  of  securing  new glory     and new strength for the monarchic idea by a worthy kinglike end to the dynasty.     He has also to bear the blame, if his conduct  furnishes a fatal  example to other     monarchs.&quot;     9.  Even if Rohrbach is right in believing that the majority of the German people would still  prefer a monarchic form of Government, it seems unquestionable that only a negligible minority would  desire to go back to autocracy.  &quot;Whether the Head of the State is the crowned representative of-one of the old dynasties or an  elected  President, the great bulk of the German people are determined to have a Government which-rests upon popular election and is responsible to the people, which represents the will of the majority  of the nation without class prerogative.   The  National Assembly has been chosen  by direct, secret, and universal  suffrage given by men and women alike on the proportional representative  system.  The Socialists have not secured  a majority  by themselves, but a decisive majority is held by the democratic bloc,  which includes  the Socialists.  The new Demoliratische Partei comprising the old Progressives (who might be  described  in our  phraseology as  Radicals*), and a large part of  the old National Liberal party have inscribed upon their  banner the motto  &quot;Everything through  the people,  everything for the  people.&quot;  They and the Socialists alike are agreed that henceforth the will of the majority of the nation, expressed by universal  suffrage, is to be accepted as the decisive authority in the political field.     It is certainly the fact that up to the  time  of the revolution Germany was not a democratic  country, in so far as the direction of the State was in the  hands of a clique without effective popular control.  The Prussian House of Representatives was elected by  methods  which made it  representative of the Junker caste  rather than of  the people  inhabiting  Prussia  as a  whole,  and although the Imperial Parliament was elected  by universal suffrage, it failed, partly through the political constitution of the Empire,. still more through  its own want;  of  initiative and energy, to exercise tie measure of control which is  exercised, for instance, by the British Parliament.  It waj sometimes described, not without some truth, if with some exaggeration, as nothing but an  ineffective &quot;debating  society.&quot;   It  is no less certain that  by  the revolution Germany  has set  about establishing popular  assemblies which, in virtue of  P.E., will represent the people  more  truly  than  the  British Parliament  represents the people,  and will have the constitutional power to replace any Government which forfeits their confidence.  If this latter state of things  cannot be described by any other name than democracy, we must say that Germany is really changing from  an autocratic into a democratic state.     10. What the result of  this change will be in the  sphere of political morality is another question, but when we  are asked to believe that a change of  this kind in any people will have no appreciable  consequences,  when we are told  that &quot; there is no change  in Germany,&quot; &amp;c, reason is staggered.     It is perhaps possible to see the psychological ground for these assertions.  People have habitually talked during these recent years as if the whole moral evil in Germany arose from its not  being democratic, as if democracy would be a complete cure  for everything, would,  in fact, be identical  with a moral change of heart.   Let only the democracy be a genuine democracy,  it was thought, and  Legion would be  exorcised. The public utterances of statesmen in England  and America gave Germany to under- stand that if she wanted to give real proof of repentance she must put down her present militarist  rulers and place the power in the hands of the people that  would be the test.  When, therefore, the  transition to democracy took place, and changes in the German mind which had been regarded as the essential  concomitants  of democracy failed to appear, we can understand  that  many people  should be thrown out in theii judgment.  A natural line for them  was to say, as is common in some quarters, &quot; This is  not democracy  at  all.&quot;   It  would perhaps, have been wiser to  question whether that connexion which their minds had established between democracy and right moraljudgment was true  to fact.     All that democracy means is that the Government is controlled  by the will of the of the majority of the nation.  There is nothing in the nature of things  to guarantee that the will of the  majority of a- nation in regard to its  dealings with  other nations will be morally good.   Narrow nationalism,  aggressive imperialism,  vindictiveness,pride, suspicion, may sway the great mass of a nation, just as they may sway a militarist clique.  In arguing, therefore, that Germany is  really and truly becoming democratic,    * In German &quot; Radikal&quot; means rather what we term &quot; doctrinaire&quot; or  extremist.  The word was ofWduring the war used to distinguish the Social Democrat Minority from the Majority Socialists.
one is not trying to decide the question  whether Germany  has  become  good.   when a nation&apos;s ideas as to the kind of political constitution which is  profitable for it, whichpromotes  its  own happiness, undergo a  complete reversal, that no  doubt means an internal convulsion, if not a  change of heart, at any rate a change of mind which musthave immense consequences.   One of those consequences  may be that it views its relations with other nations in a new light, that it adopts different moral standards for international  dealings.  Is such a consequence following the democratic revolution inGermany ?  This will now be considered,    11. The  answer to the question whether a change in the standards of moral judg-ment has taken place in Germany will depend not upon the  bare fact that Germany hasbecome democratic, but upon the kind of ideas which actually prevail in the majorityof the German people as distinguished from  those which  prevailed  in the old  rulingcaste.  We cannot, therefore, answer it satisfactorily  till the men put in power by the popular vote  show what spirit they are of.   All that  we can say at present is that theSocial Democrats are  for  the  time being predominant, that it  seems certain that the ideas for  which Socialism stands will have  a  great  share  in determining the  futureactions of the German State, and that Socialism in  Germany has regularly opposed the Gewaltpolitik (policy  of violence) which was followed by  the old  regime  in itsdealings  with  other  nations, and  stood for  peace and  the solidarity of mankind.What, therefore, has just been said with regard to the change of mind in Germany asto the desirable form of political constitution at home may  be said equally with regardto the change in the ideals of  international action that what we  have is not so much the conversion of individuals to new views as the transference of power  to another set of men, whose principles (so  far  as  international  relations went)  had always beenunexceptionable.   Only whereas the change  of belief as to  the  desirable  form ofgovernment is not necessarily a change of heart,  since it may be determined by  purelyselfish  considerations, a change which replaces in international dealings the principlesof Gewaltpolitik by the ideals of goodwill and human solidarity must be recognised as having moral quality.    12. The principles of Gewaltpolitik have always been repudiated by the great bodyof Socialists (the party contained a right wing whose views  differed little from those ofthe Geioaltpolitikej-&apos;) and by a certain section of the  bourgeoisie.   The charge to whichthe German Socialists as a whole laid themselves  open during the war was not that  cheyexpressed approval of the aggressive national  imperialism, which  was the  guiding principle  of  the filling class as a matter of fact, they continued to protest against it but that  they  did not actively oppose the Government, that they voted credits forcarrying on  the war, and either tamely accepted the  official view of the facts of thewar, or failed to denounce abominations.   (They did express disapproval of the peace of Brest-Litovsk, but continued  to vote&apos; war  credits.)  They  may  be  charged withweakness and  compromise,  not with subscription to  inhuman imperialist theories.Yet even with regard to the accusation of weakness, one must remember the defence that they always put forward.  They said that, wherever the original blame for the war might have lain, the enemies of Germany had now announced the intention of  cutting off from Germany territories which had formed  part of the German Empire when thewar began. They, therefore, had no choice but either to help the German State to victoryor be parties to its territorial diminution. And it is perfectly true that the powers at warwith  Germany  did make no secret  of  their  intention to take away from Germanyterritory which had been  attached to the&apos;Empire&apos;in  July  11)14, and that the only way in which  this intention could be frustrated, when the war had  once started, was by aGerman victory.  The German Socialists took their  stand  as the upholders  of thestatus quo of July  1914.  If  we are  right  in holding that that status quo was unjust,they may be  morally censured for helping to defend it.     But what ought the German Socialists to have done ?   They ought, it may be  said,to have urged  Germany&apos;s making the required sacrifice of  territory and power.  Thatmay be true, but so long as it seemed possible for Germany to maintain  by victory the integrity of its pre-war frontiers (and it was possible only by victory, once the war had begun),  there  would need  to  have  been in the German  Socialists a  willingness  to subordinate national desires to the general principles of justice  such as  is nut commonamong  men, for them to have refused war  credits to  their  Government on moralgrounds.     13.  When we  consider whether the new  Germany is  going to be guided in its international dealings by loyalty to the principles of  justice and freedom, we must ask whether the German Socialists will show, when they  have the chief power in the State,a firmer  adherence to the  principles they have always professed than they showed
 under the conditions of the war.   There seems reason  to expect that they will.   For,. in  the first place, by their overthrowing of the old Government, they did brace them- selves in the end  to  an act  of will,   kven though such an act of will is tardy, and,. like Hamlet&apos;s, brought about by the compulsion of a desperate, emergency, nevertheless, it breaks the spell which has paralysed the agent up till then, and secures for his future activity a new freedom from inhibition.  In the second place, the motive for compromise, which existed  during the war, the hope  of securing the territorial integrity of the German Empire, exists no longer.   The Socialists and  Democrats in the new Germany will not be  hampered by,the unhappy results of the old state policy a status quo, which it was immoral to defend and dreadful to give up.     14  It is hardly necessary to  give quotations from&apos; Socialist  sources to show the vigour with  which the party  now in power  repudiates,  as  morally evil, the policy of  the old Germany with regard  to other nations.  One  may point out how similar utterances are  now commonly found in other than Socialist organs.   Wilhelm Heile, Naumaniis coadjutor,  writes  in &quot;Die Hilfe&quot; (November  14th, p.  542) of the men of the old system  as the  arrogant, high and mighty, self-seeking representatives of that policy of  domination  at  home,  of violence  both  at home and abroad&quot; (&quot;jener Herrenpolitik im Innern und Gewaltpolitik naoh innen  und nach aussen&quot;).     Dr. Friedrich Thimme describes the character of the old policy as follows :           &quot;After  Bismarck&apos;s  fall that tendency immediately  asserted itself in  the ,-,   policy  of  the German Empire, which we have  come to  know as specifically     Prussian ;  with a base too restricted and not sufficiently secured, the ship of State  .  . was launched impatiently and vehemently upon the high  seas of Weltpolitik and     &apos; naval   policy,&apos; whereby the England, upon whose friendship  Bismarck  had     always been able to count, was converted into an enemy. . . .  With a democratic     Germany,  which would have shown itself accessible to the will of the people, the     world might have come to terms.   Militarist Germany, which held obstinately to     the maxim that States could only be maintained by the same means  by which  they     had been founded, and  which  therefore logically strove to  increase more and more     the  amount of  force it could bring  to bear, drove  us however peaceful its     intentions  may really have been into the great world war.&quot; . .  .       -;                    (&quot; Deutsche Politik &quot; for the 22nd November, p. 1481.)     The cause  of Germany&apos;s breakdown, Thimme insists, was &quot;the excessive assertion of  the military principle &quot;  (&quot; die Uberspannung des militarischen Prinzips &quot;).   Even the imperialist  Dr. Iiohrbach writes that, while Prussia  had rendered great services to Germany, it  has, &quot;through the New-Prussian  militarist type  &quot;(&quot; das neupreussische militaristische Wesen &quot;), &quot; which was a product predominantly of Prussian soil, done immense harm  and was  mainly  responsible for the  catastrophe  which has befallen Germany.&quot;-(&quot; Die Hilfe &quot; for the  5th December.&quot; p. 585.)     Not so long ago almost  all Germans outside Socialist circles professed to be wholly unable to understand what foreigners meant when they  spoke of German &quot;militarism.&quot; They said that &quot;German militarism&quot; was  nothing but the   invention of malignant liars.  So far as the nation lias moved from that position  to the position  represented by  such admissions as have just been quoted, it can hardly be denied that we have an alteration of  moral  judgment, which, if not a change  of  heart, is a recognition  that something was  wrong.   The  case of Hans. Delbruck, whose good faith  there is no reason  to  doubt,  is. significant,    lii  the  October   number of  the  &quot; Preussische Jahrhiicher,&quot; he wrote with  engaging frankness :          &quot; All 7ny political writings hitherto have gone upon the presuppositions which     have been traditional in politics and have been  held valid for thousands of years-     upon the idea that the State is essentially ordered Force and its highest law that     of self-preservation. ...   But  what if after this war  we are entering upon a new     age  of the  world, in which the old Force theory  will be replaced by quite  new     conditions  of international life ?  What if an ordered Force comes to be established     by the consensus of the peoples and excludes in the future the outbreak of Avar?&quot;     15. Perhaps still more remarkable utterances are those which check the tendency to complain of what  is being  inflicted upon Germany  by the  thought what Germany would have done in the event of a  German victory.  For this is to recognise, even in the act of suffering treatment thought to be unfair, that the will of the enemy is no worse than Germany&apos;s will was before the catastrophe.
     Naumann  writes  in  his  journal published  in &quot; Die Hilfe&quot;  (under date  the19th November):          &quot;We  must keep on  reminding, ourselves how  the  Germans would have     behaved if they had won the victory.   Amongst us, too, there would have been     no lack of mad violence (&quot; Tollheit &quot;), and it is by no means certain whether, in     the event of a victory, we should have had any statesman to show the moderation     which Bismarck showed in 1866 and 1870.&quot;     A Social Democrat writes  about the great shipmaster Albert Ballin, who died onthe 9th November, in the midst of the first revolutionary outbreak at Hamburg:          &quot; He was  quite free from  the national  conceit,  which supposes we have a     right to  set ourselves up morally above other nations  and therefore makes us     blind to things.  A month  before his death he wrote against the wave of public     indignation:  &apos; One needs only to picture what we should  demand, if  the case     were reversed.   We should  certainly  not  refrain  from  marching into Paris     and London,  dictating  peace in Buckingham  Palace, and  annexing  everything     from the Urals to the Bay of Biscay.&apos; &quot;                   (&quot; Sozialistische Monatshefte &quot; for the 26th November, p. 1078.)     16.  A new Germany which so judges of the spirit of the old Germany is not likely to embark upon new grandiose  schemes of  aggression.   Apart from the moral considera-tion, we find the recognition  that  it is  no longer physically possible for Germany torealise the old projects of  Weltpolitilt such as  the much talked  of  Mitteleuropa.Naumann, the chief prophet of that idea, could hardly be  expected, even to-day, to regard  it as having been morally reprehensible, since all he  ever claimed was  thatMitteleuropa would constitute a World Power on an equal with the British Empire andthe United States, which Germany by herself could not do.  But he writes to-day:           &quot; All hope, ail optimism must  be  concentrated upon  preparing for a better     future.  And it must be clearly understood from the outset, that we cannot think,     that we ought not  to think, of building up a new world power.  That is  a spoilt     chapter, closed and done with !   We must see to it that we become great in  the     &apos; goods and gifts  of peace, in the sphere of  national  well-being,  freedom and     manners &apos; (Imperial proclamation of 1871).  Our carriage must be shunted on to     other lines, and directed to ideals which are purely economic and cultural.&quot;                                    (&quot; Die  Hilfe&quot;  for the 19th December, p. 612.)     17.  It seems, therefore, that we have a real change of direction in Germany, implyingnot  only  a  different conception of the  kind of political constitution  profitable for germany, but a different mode of  judgment  in international, relations.  But this is notto affirm that  we  have  everything which  the people  expected, who  looked for a&quot;repentance&quot;  of  Germany.  What they desired was that the  prevalent opinion inGermany should admit clearly that the guilt  for originating this war rested exclusivelyor predominantly upon the Central  Powers, that the Germans in the course of the  war had done  deliberately abominable things for which there was  no parallel on our side.It was because they do not  yet find this  admission (except  in the case of a  fewindividuals such as Kurt Eisner or Dr. Muehlon or F. W. Forster) that they declare intheir disappointment that there  is  &quot; no trace of  a repentance,&quot; and even that  therevolution is a sham.   Now it is  quite true that we do not yet find  in Germany anygeneral acknowledgment of Germany&apos;s peculiar guilt in the origination and conduct ofthe  war.   The Majority  Social Democrats, who are now in power, whilst they have always denounced the old Government for its autocracy and militarism, and whilst theydeprecated, for instance, unrestricted submarine warfare, always maintained that  theenemy Governments were equally, or more, guilty.  It does not seem that the revolutionhas  made any appreciable change  in their  views in this respect. At the time indeedwhen  Eisner published  the  Bavarian documents with regard  to  the diplomatictransactions  immediately preceding the  war, a cry was wrung from the &quot;Vorwarts,&quot;which was in effect the admission of an especial  degree of guilt  attaching  to  theold German Government:           &quot; We were told  that Vienna&apos;s  ultimatum to Serbia had not been known in     Berlin.  A lie !  That  Berlin had  admonished Vienna  to  exercise  self-restraint.       [1012]                                                           D
    A lie !   On the contrary, Berlin egged Vienna on.  William said  in his proclama-    tion &apos; In the midst of peace the enemy has fallen upon us.&apos;  A groundless, audacious,    despicable, shameless lie!  And does this gang of wretched murderers, which has    really come off very easily in the  revQlution, thanks to the magnanimity of the    people,  still  dream that it  will  be  able to re-establish its  blood-stained, lie-    besmirched rule ?                                           (&quot; Vorwarts &quot; for the 25th November.)    At the same moment a number of  newspapers seem to  have spoken in the same sense.  At any rate, Rohrbach, who will have none of such admissions, writes angrily:          &quot; The newspaper people  strike a  blow against the body of their own nation,    by stupidly, falsely, unscrupulously shoving the &apos; guilt&apos; for the war upon Germany.    A few months ago they were  setting forth  the proof to the contrary.   Is it that    they want  to coax  the  enemy to be kind to us ?  The enemy only despises  such    procedure.&quot;                                (&quot; Deutsche Politik&quot; for 29th November,  p. 1506.)    The very fact -that writers  insist with  vehemence  that Germans must not  allowthemselves to be driven into admitting  a peculiar degree of guilt implies a certainweakening in that direction.         &quot; To be sure it may seem like harping  too much on the same string to go on    discussing the Russian  Minister of&apos; War [Suchomlinoff], Edward VII&apos;s policy of    encirclement, Poincare, the apostle of revanche, but we really ought not to a low,    against our better knowledge and conscience, the suggestion of the world, just    because the superiority of power against us grew too great, to  force us into the    position of the guilty  party (&quot; auf die Bank des. Angeklagten drangen&quot;).                       (Rohrbach, &quot;Deutsche Politik&quot; for  1st November, p. 1378.)    18. But, generally speaking, whilst  German writers -of  democratic  or  socialisttendencies  are  ready to admit a  share in the guilt,  they will  admit no more  thana share:          &quot; It is absolutely unbearable to have to see, day after day, those who now have    the power in Germany [the writer is thinking, no doubt, mainly of Eisner] fouling    their own nest.  We ourselves have fought emphatically enough in all conscience    against the old system, briefly described by the names of Tirpitz and LudendorfT.    We are the last  to deny the  share of guilt (&quot; Mitschuld &quot;) for the outbreak and    protraction of the war which  rested upon the men of the old system.   But when    people go  beyond  the honest and  conscientious acknowledgment of Germany&apos;s    share of  the  guilt to make themselves champions of  the Entente lies, and simply    shut their eyes to the guilt of the Entente politicians, much greater than, or at any    rate as great as,  our own  .... that  is not only an incredible political folly, in    view of its effect upon the Entente, but  must drive a blush of shame and anger into    the cheeks of every German.&quot;                                  (Heile,  &quot; Die Hilfe &quot; for 19th December, p. 612.)    It is plain that  Eisner&apos;s revelations  produced  a wide impression.   A Socialistwriter speaks of &quot; the wild fury against the criminal authors of the conflagration whowere unmasked by the Bavarian Government&quot;  (Heinrich Schultz,  &quot; Die Glocke &quot; forthe 30th November, p. 1102).  And even in quarters  where  no more  than  a share  ofthe guilt is admitted  there is  sometimes a readiness to take that share seriously  in individual self-examination.            .         &quot; The awfulness of this interminable war has stirred up our conscience.  We    come at last to  asking ourselves:  Did we ourselves not leave something undone    which might have prevented  the terrible  thing ;  does not each of us  singly bear    a share of the  guilt (&apos;Mitschuld&apos;)  for what happened?. . . .   The  destiny  of    nations is  not  a fate which passes on  over our heads, but we are called ourselves    to shape that destiny  by creative power and devote our whole  souls to the work.    We begin to understand the old Bible  story, which saw in the  ruin of nations the    judgment of God ...   It is not enough simply to prove that the haphazard and
     high-handed  policy (&apos; die Zufalls- und Machtpolitik&apos;) which we  followed  has     carried us into the abyss, that things must be different in  the future; it  is not     even enough to fix our eyes on the right goal; what is before all else necessary is     to have the clearest perception of the  way that leads to it  ... .  Certainly Hiller     is right when he says:  Let each man confess:  I did  not  prevent  the war of     1914; . . .  . the organised proletariat did  not prevent it; organised Christianity     did  not prevent  it.   And then let each man resolve :  Every war which threatens     to break out hereafter I will prevent....   He who makes this confession and this     resolution ceases  to shed hot tears, to utter  wild rhapsodical curses ;  he sets about     cool, methodical,  concrete work.&quot;         (Wally Zepler, &quot; Sozialistische Monatshefte &quot; for the 10th December, p.  1142.)         &quot; In  this  dark hour we  must  recognise and acknowledge that we stand     on  the brink of the abyss.   Perhaps we  have  deserved our fate  in  the sense     in which every nation deserves its fate.  We bear  a share of  guilt  (&apos; Mitschuld &apos;)     for  the epoch  of William II,  and a  share  of the guilt for the  course taken     by the  revolution.   But it  is  unworthy  and  hysterical to  exaggerate  out of     all   due proportion  our share of guilt in the  origination and  the  conduct of     the war by cringing self-abasement before our enemies, to ask for the lash with     cowardly  bent back, like  a  slave.   That  is  Oriental, not  German.   It is both     unworthy  and politically  futile.   It is  infinitely more  important that  every     individual  should examine himself and  set before  his  own conscience what     measure of guilt  for the collapse rests upon  him personally, how far he himself     was  a corrupt creature of his time.   And out of this self-knowledge, which need     not  be lachrymose  and &quot;unmanly, the resolve must immediately grow,  never     again to fall into the old mistakes, but to go to meet the  dawn of a new time as     a new man.&quot;              (&quot; munich Neueste Nachrichten &quot; for the 31st December, evening.)     19. How far, we  may ask, is it  true to say  that  there  can  be  &quot;  no  shadow ofrepentance &quot; in the  Germans till they have admitted, not only their share of the guilt,but their peculiar or predominant guilt for  the war and the atrocities committed duringthe war ?     It is important in this  connection to  distinguish between beliefs as to general principles and  beliefs as to  facts.   In  almost  all current  controversy as to  whetherGermany has &quot; repented &quot; or not these two things  are confused.  There  is  still ageneral refusal in Germany to believe, or at any rate to realise, that the things which wecharge against the Germans  were ever done.  In the matter, for instance of the Belgianatrocities, the mode in which things were represented at  the time by the  GermanGovernment still holds the  field  in  Germany.   And, obviously,  people  cannot repentfor things which they  believe never took place.   On the other hand, a  failure on thepart of the Germans to distinguish true and false in matters of fact is not the same asa moral perversion which leads men to call good evil and evil good when they see them.     20.  The evil principle which we charged  against  the  old German government under  such  terms  as Machtpolitik, Geiraltpolitik,  militarism,  aggressive  nationalambition, are, as  we  have  seen, acknowledged by the men  now in  power  to havecharacterised the old regime, and are emphatically repudiated; so long as they remainin power, we can expect that the new Germany will be guided by another spirit thanthe old Germany.  Is it necessary that they  should not only hold right principles,  but have a true view of the facts which occurred  between  July 1914 and November  1918 ?It must be allowed that the relations of the new Germany to ourselves and  the rest of theworld can never be completely satisfactory  till the true facts are generally recognised in Germany.  On the other  hand, to be indignantly astonished because the true facts are  not  recognised in Germany to-day seems to  show  a crude  understanding of human psychology.  Some people seem to have expected that the moment the Germansfound themselves  defeated,  or the  moment they became democratic,  their beliefsas to a  whole number of events during the past four-and-a-half  years beliefs whichthey had held as palpable truths would instantly change.   Why should they ?  Howdoes a German  defeat or the  establishment of a German republic  constitute  decisiveevidence of the German atrocities in Belgium, or of the fact that the &quot;Lusitania &quot;  wasnot crammed with munitions of war, or of the ill-treatment of British prisoners ?   the channels of information open to us on our side have made many facts seem to  us plainin broad  dayhght, from the sight of which the German public  has been shut off by an      [1012]                                                            E
 opaque wall or a distorting medium of continuous false suggestion.  There was nothing in a German defeat to bring these facts instantly for  Germany within the&apos;field of unimpeded vision.   Indirectly, indeed, one may hope that the defeat  of Germany will dispose the Germans in the end to recognise that the &quot; Entente lies &quot; were to a large&apos; extent  only too  true.  That  may happen in  various ways.   In  the first  place, the prevalent belief  in  Germany as  to the facts of the war is  derived  from the official presentment of things, and by the defeat the German people has found out that its uld rulers were liars.  &quot; Wir sind belogen und betrogen &quot; was the cry which went up, when defeat was  first confessed.   The process of logical thought, when  it  has had time to reach its completion, may lead the Germans to recognise that the authority which they found mendacious as to the military situation was mendacious also in its presentment of many other things.   Secondly, it is likely that in the near future many new documents will leap to light, and that the removal of the censorship will allow many of those who witnessed the German misdeeds at first hand to speak out the truth in Germany.  The disclosure  of the Bavarian  documents by Eisner was probably only the first-of a whole series of similar shocks which will be administered to the German people. But all this will require time to work, and at a moment when the Germans are faced with acute distress and terrible possibilities of personal suffering, although it would no doubt be morally finer if they were  occupied  with pondering their degree of  responsibility for the sufferings inflicted on other people&apos;s children, it  is  perhaps humanly natural that the sufferings of their own should occupy the forefront of their thoughts.     21. One must recognise that when people accuse the present German Government of being a militarist Government in disguise,  they can appeal  for confirmation to utterances  publicly  made  in Germany.    Daumig,  for  instance,  an  ex-editor  of &quot; Vorwarts,&quot; is reported as having said in his speech -at the Workmen  and Soldiers&apos; Congress in Berlin on the 18th December : &quot; It is an illusion  to believe that militarism is actually disposed  of.  Its spirit is still very much alive.  You  can detect it  even in this hall! &quot;  It is, however, important to realise  from  wdiat circles such utterances proceed.   They proceed either from Spartacist (Bolshevik) circles,  or  from men at the extreme.left  of   the Independent party,  like  Daumig, largely  in  sympathy  with Bolshevism.  For them any Government which attempted to  coerce mob rule would  be &quot; militarist.&quot; and &quot; reactionary.&quot;   The correspondent of the.&quot; Manchester  Guardian,&quot; the  notorious M. P. Price, similarly reflects  the Bolshevik view  of  things  when  he reports  from Berlin (&quot;Manchester  Guardian,&quot; 16th January):  &quot;The  formidable military machine,  which  seemed to  be crushed  for ever, has  risen  again  with astounding rapidity.....Germany is now under the  control of  the same  elements which applauded and carried on  the war,&quot; &amp;c.   If, however, we make our picture of Germany by combining everything bad which the Bolshevists say about the Government with everything bad which, the Government says about the Bolshevists, the picture can hardly fail to be a very black&apos; one.     As a matter  of  fact, the hope of Germany&apos;s escaping the  pitfall of reaction on one side and the pitfall of anarchy on the other, of becoming  an orderly state of democratic character with decent principles  of international behaviour, lies  in the  prevalence of the elements represented by the Ebert-Scheidemann Government.  Scheidmann himself may be personally too vain, fluent, and  flexible to possess a high moral authority, but Ebert seems a solid sensible man, and the wav in which his  Government since  the revolution has contended with a situation of desperate difficulty will perhaps some day be recognised as a very fine  performance.  By.  the Bolshevists and many  of  the Independenta it  is  accused  of being bloody and tyrannical,, by others it is accused of having been weak in its shrinking from the application of armed force, in its fear of bloodshed.  Probably, when its record is reviewed in the  light of its ultimate outcome, it will appear that  it has committed various  mistakes ; yet mistakes will be seen to have been almost inevitable when the difficulties and dangers of the situation are taken into account.     22.  It remains doubtful, of. course, whether the moderate elements will succeed in retaining control.  The  number of convinced Spartacists in Germany is  certainly not large,  and  the great bulk  of the people are  prepared, according to their present intentions,   to back  up  a  Government  comprised  of Majority Socialists or sincere Democrats.   But the great danger of the situation consists in the psychological effects of violent  change upon large masses of people.  The  ordinary man everywhere  is carried by habit through the routine of  every day, and when his routine has once been broken up by exciting experiences, he finds it very  difficult to readjust himself to the rhythm of normal humdrum life.  Thousands of people all over Germany, especially in the large cities,  are  in this  condition of nervous unrest.  The large numbers of
returned soldiers and sailors without occupation are only very imperfectly amenable toany sort of discipline, and the problem of  inducing them to return to regular civil lifeis a very graye one  for the Government.   The Government has not sufficient materialpower at its disposal  to avoid  compromise of various kinds  with the elements  ofdisintegration.  In these circumstances one must recognise that the danger of Germany&apos;sfalling into anarchy and chaos is a very real one.
