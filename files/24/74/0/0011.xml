WEEKLY APPRECIATION OF MATTERS OF NAVAL INTEREST. - No. 6.

Week ended 25th January 1919.

ADRIATIC.

Admiral ? having suspended the sittings of the Adriatic Committee, the British, American and French Admirals reported their opinions independently to their respective Governments. It was decided that these Reports should be considered in conjunction with the views of Marshal Foch, but it now appears that the French Government prefers the views of the three Admirals to those of the Marshal.

Several British ships have been mined in the Adriatic, and the Italian Government has been informed that unless their sweeping operations are attended with better results, the advisability of sending British Colliers to those Waters will be taken into consideration.

The British, American and French Admirals, not being satisfied with the conduct of the Italian Authorities as regards the allocation and running of enemy merchant ships, and considering them to be administering the position unfairly, the Italian Government has been informed that we will not sanction the acquisition by private Firms of interests in enemy vessels, and was requested not to deviate from the policy of the ?. Since then there has been a distinct disposition on the part of the Italians to defer to our instructions, and the Italian Admiralty Staff, which has been endeavouring to treat the Admirals&apos; Committee as under its jurisdiction, now agrees that the Committee&apos;s decision is final.

DANUBE.

The allocation by the Allied C-in-C. of enemy monitors to the Serbs marks the commencement of the Serbian Navy, that Power never before having possessed vessels of war. The monitors will be employed on the Danube, and the organisation of a Naval Service is in the hands of Captain Haggard, R.N.

BLACK SEA AND MARMORA.

General Franchet d&apos;Esperoy will arrive at Constantinople on February 5th. General Allenby leaves Haifa on February 4th to meet him, and they will confer with the High Commissioner. General Allenby is being provided with a Cruiser and Escort, and his visit is to be made as impressive as possible.

Great insecurity and disorder prevail in Constantinople and we are assuming charge of police and situation, and contemplate also assuming control of the prisons in view of the deplorable condition of the prisoners. We cannot assume military control of the City without Allied consent.

General Milne, who is responsible for order in Constantinople, but is subordinate to General Franchet d&apos;Esperey, will shortly proceed to Batoum, Baku, and Transcaspia, to investigate the situation, with special reference to Bolshevist aggression.

Liman von banders has boon sent to Prinkipo.
