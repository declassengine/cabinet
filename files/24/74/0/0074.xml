The  three principal Trade Unions exclusively concerned with the  organisation ofrailway servants are the National Union of Railwaymen, the Associated Society of Loco-motive Engineers and Firemen, and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, and of these, thefirst and third have drawn up programmes containing demands involving considerablealterations in the remuneration and in the working conditions of the railwaymen.   Theearly connection of the  Society of Locomotive Engineers with the movement is not clear,but in the later stages  the Society has worked in close  touch with the National Union1;of Railwaymen.    In 1914, at a conference held at Swansea,  the Executive Committee of the NationalUnion of Railwaymen brought forward&apos;proposals for a national policy to be pursued byall Trade Unions whose members were connected with any branch of the railway service,whether in the traffic departments, in the workshops, or on the clerical staffs.  difficulties were encountered in securing the co-operation of the other trade unions concerned, buta definite programme was adopted by the National  Union itself of which the principalpoints were:     (1) An 8-hour day.    (2) Nationalisation of railways.    (3) Due representation of the workers in the  management.                     ;    (4) An increase in wages of 5s; a week.

     Throughout the war, the National Union of Railwaymen, while observing the &quot;Indus- trial Truce,&quot; steadily kept in mind the national programme, and towards the end of the year 1917, different bodies of members of the Union formulated suggested programmes. On 21st August, 1917, the President  of the Board of Trade gave a pledge to the railway- men^ unions to the effect that sympathetic consideration would be given to the intro- duction of a shorter working day for railwaymen at the earliest possible moment after the cessation of hosilities.     In November, 1917, a conference of  official representatives of the Union met at Leicester to decide the final form of  programme.  At the conference, Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P. (General Secretary of the Union), in a preliminary speech advocated the nationalisa- tion of railways and other means of  transport, and a share for the workers of control on the lines of a Joint Industrial Council.  Other more advanced views were expressed, hut general stress was laid upon the  desirability of nationalising the railways.  The programme .as finally agreed upon was as follows :      Hours. That eight constitute a  working day and 48 hours a working week.     Wages. That all advances  given as war increases be converted into permanent wages.     Guaranteed Day and Guaranteed Week. That a guaranteed day  and a guaranteed         week be established on all railways.     Overtime. That double time be paid for all overtime.     Sunday Duty (between 12 o&apos;clock midnight Saturday and 12 o&apos;clock midnight Sunday).         -To be paid for at the rate of double time.   Sunday duty to be independent         of the guaranteed week.     Night Duty (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.). That night duty be paid for at the rate of time-and-         a-half.     Piecework, Tonnage, and Bonus Systems. That all piecework,  tonnage and bonus         systems be abolished.     Mileage System. That on these systems where  locomotive men at present work         under a mileage clause, 120  miles to constitute a day&apos;s work on passenger trains         and 96 miles  on goods trains;   all mileage over and above this be paid for at         an equivalent rate.     Rest. That the period of rest between each turn of duty be not less than  12 hours.     Hybrid Grades. That hybrid grades be abolished.     Standard Rates of Pay. That conditions of service for railwaymen  be standardised         upon all railways in the United Eingdom.     Management of Railways. That there be equal representation, both national and         local, for this Union upon the management of all railways in the United Kingdom.     Although urged at the Leicester  conference to take immediate steps to carry out the programme, the Executive Committee continued to observe the &quot; Industrial Truce &quot; until after the signature of the armistice on the 11th November.   Strong representations were then made that the Government should  at once redeem the pledge given in  1917  that an early opportunity should be  given to the railwaymen to discuss and  negotiate a reduc- tion in the working week;  it was upon this &quot; plank,&quot; the 8-hour day, that the attention of  the railwaymen was immediately  concentrated.  The Executive  Committee formally terminated the  &quot; Industrial Truce,&quot;  so far as the National  Union  of Railwaymen was concerned, in order to  devote itself to the furtherance  of the National Programme, due notice being sent to the Board  of Trade, Railway Executive Committee, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and the Triple Alliance (of Railwaymen, Miners, and Transport Workers).     Negotiations with the Government were undertaken by the National Union of Rail- waymen, and on 5th December, during the progress of these negotiations, there was a threat of a general, though semi-official, strike  on all the railways within 48 hours, unless the demand for an 8-hour day  was conceded.  On 6th December, the President of the Board of Trade announced that the Government had conceded the principle of an 8-hour day for all members of the wages staff.   (The decision does not affect  the railway work- shops in which the hours correspond with those in the engineering trade, and are at present47  per week.)   The actual application of the 8-hour day was postponed until 1st February to  enable the necessary re-arrangement to be made, and the details  of the scheme to be worked out.     The more radical of the changes  demanded in the Leicester programme, namely,&apos;the nationalisation  of the railways,  and a share of the railway servants in the control of the
RAILWAYS WERE UNTOUCHED BY THIS CONCESSION, AND BEFORE THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE APPLICA&quot;TION OF THE NEW HOURS WERE COMPLETE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL Union of railwaymen PASSED RESOLUTIONS CALLING UPON THE GOVERNMENT AND  THE RAILWAY companies to CARRY OUT THE MEN&apos;s FULL DEMANDS, AND THREATENED TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION to ENFORCETHEM.    ON 30TH JANUARY THE ENDEAVOURS WHICH HAD BEEN  MADE  TO ARRIVE AT satisfactory arrangements FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE 8-HOUR DAY RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENTSIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE, SIR HERBERT WALKER, ON BEHALF OF THE railway executive COMMITTEE,  AND MR. WALTER HUDSON, ON BEHALF OF  THE NATIONAL  UNION of railwaymen:     &quot; THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 8-HOUR DAY FOR RAILWAYMEN IS TO BE GIVEN EFFECT TO AS FROM 1STFEBRUARY, ON THE basis OF THE EXISTING CONDITIONS OF SERVICE, AND WHERE IT IS  NOT FOUNDPRACTICABLE TO REDUCE THE WORKING HOURS TO EIGHT, OVERTIME WILL BE PAID FOR ALL TIME WORKEDAFTER THE EXPIRATION OF EIGHT WORKING HOURS.    &quot; IN CALCULATING THE EIGHT HOURS TIME ALLOTTED for MEALS WILL  NOT BE COUNTED IN CASESWHERE TIME HAS HITHERTO BEEN SO ALLOTTED, FOR EXAMPLE :     &quot; (1) A MAN HITHERTO BOOKED ON AT 6 AND WORKING CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL 4 WILL, IF BOOKED           ON AT 6,  CEASE WORKING at 2, or IF HE WORKS LATER WILL BE PAID AT OVERTIME RATE           FROM 2.    &quot; (2) A MAN HITHERTO BOOKED ON AT 6 AND WORKING UNTIL 5, WITH A MEAL HOUR BETWEEN           (SAY) 12  AND 1,  WILL, IF BOOKED ON at 6  CEASE WORKING AT 3 (WITH AN HOUR&apos;S MEAL           INTERVAL), OR IF HE WORKS LATER, WILL BE PAID AT OVERTIME RATE FROM 3.    &quot;WHERE A MAN&apos;S WORK has BEEN ARRANGED ON A WEEKLY BASIS.OVERTIME WILL BE PAIDAFTER 48 HOURS&apos;  WORK, AND AS REGARDS ALLOTTED MEAL TIMES, THE PRINCIPLE SET OUT IN EXAMPLENO. 2 WILL APPLY, i.e., ALLOTTED MEAL TIMES WILL NOT  BE COUNTED IN CALCULATING WORKING HOURS.    &quot; The ABOVE IS WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE &quot;RIGHT OF EITHER SIDE TO CLAIM DIFFERENT ARRANGE-MENTS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS NOW PENDING.&quot;    A MEETING WAS ALSO HELD WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ASSOCIATED SOCIETY OF LOCO-MOTIVE ENGINEERS AND FIREMEN, AND A SIMILAR AGREEMENT COME TO AND SIGNED BY Mr. J.BROMLEY.    A FURTHER OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT STATED THAT IT WAS HOPED THAT A PRELIMINARY meeting would SHORTLY BE HELD FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE MEN&apos;S DEMANDS FOR ALTERED CONDITIONS OFSERVICE AND RATES OF PAY.    THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME OF THE RAILWAY  CLERKS ASSOCIATION IS OF MUCH LATER ORIGIN,AND IS IN  CLOSE CONNECTION WITH THE QUESTION  OF &quot; RECOGNITION.&quot;   IN NOVEMBER LAST THEASSOCIATION ALTERED  ITS RULES SO AS TO ENABLE IT TO ORGANISE THE SUPERVISORY AND ADMINIS-TRATIVE STAFFS, SUCH  AS STATIONMASTERS, INSPECTORS  AND AGENTS, AS WELL AS THE CLERICAL STAFFPROPER, AND IT NOW CLAIMS TO REPRESENT 70 PER CENT, OF THE RAILWAY  CLERICAL STAFFS AND NEARLY60 PER CENT, OF THE SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE  STAFFS.   On 10TH JANUARY THE ASSOCIATIONFORWARDED TO THE RAILWAY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE  THE  PROGRAMME  WHICH IT HAD DRAWN UP.The ITEMS OF THE PROGRAMME MAY BE SUMMARISED  AS FOLLOWS :      Working Hours. A 38-HOUR WEEK FOR DAY  WORKERS, AND A  34-HOUR WEEK FOR NIGHT        WORKERS.  ABOLITION OF &quot; SPLIT TURNS.&quot;  A  WEEKLY HALF-HOLIDAY.  OVERTIME PAY        FOR EACH DAILY HOUR OVER  SEVEN.  DOUBLE PAY FOR WORK ON PUBLIC  HOLIDAYS.  A        fortnight&apos;s HOLIDAY ANNUALLY, AND ANOTHER  CASUAL SEVEN DAYS.    Salaries. A MINIMUM SCALE RISING FROM  70 A YEAR FOR BOYS OF 16 TO  160 FOR men        OF 21,  AND   230 FOR MEN OF 28.  AN ADDITIONAL  20 FOR CLERKS IN THE LONDON AREA.        For AGENTS, STATIONMASTERS, INSPECTORS, AND  OTHERS not GENERAL CLERKS, A SCALE  of        SALARIES RANGING FROM  250 A YEAR TO  850,  WITH ANNUAL OR BIENNIAL  INCREMENTS        BRINGING THE MAXIMA FOR THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES TO AMOUNTS VARYING FROM  350        TO  1,000.     The PROGRAMME ALSO INCLUDES DEMANDS FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF THE STAFF  ON A JOINT        BODY TO DEAL WITH PROMOTIONS ;  THE PROVISION OF SICK PAY ;  THE GRANTING OF AN        ADEQUATE UNIFORM ALLOWANCE TO UNIFORMED MEMBERS OF  THE STAFF;  AND THE PRO-        VISION OF DETACHED RESIDENCES WITH AMPLE GARDENS FOR STATIONMASTERS  COMPELLED        TO LIVE NEAR THEIR STATIONS.     NEGOTIATIONS UPON THE PROGRAMME HAVE  BEEN HITHERTO HELD UP OWING TO difficulties arising UPON THE RECOGNITION OF the RIGHT OF  THE RAILWAY CLERKS ASSOCIATION, TO ACT OHBEHALF OF THE SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFFS, BUT ON 5TH FEBRUARY IT WAS ANNOUNCEDTHAT FULL RECOGNITION HAD BEEN ACCORDED TO THE ASSOCIATION.    (C 1656)                                                                 A 2
                              II-PRESS COMMENTS.                          (1) Labour and Socialist Press.                              (A) Peace Conference. League of Nations.     The Labour Papers are still doubtful as to the form which the proposed League of Nations will ultimately assume.   Will it be a  true League of Peoples, or an Alliance of the Entente Governments?  The &quot;Labour  Leader&quot; fears that the latter forecast is most likely to be correct.  The formation of a true League requires that the principal powers should  be imbued with a genuine international  spirit, but already  the small nations are protesting  that  they have too little voice  in the deliberations.   Again, the exclusion of Germany from the  Conference leads several papers to take a sceptical point of view.  In addition to the  &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; and the &quot;Call,&quot; Mr.  Brailsford, inthe &quot; Herald,&quot; also says that to exclude Germany will be to drive her forward to a general Social revolution which would destroy in a year what a generation could scarcely build up again.  &quot; Justice &quot; looks upon the whole Conference as a farce, where the representatives are spouting platitudes about a possible League, while the German Social-Democrats are making war on the Poles with Hindenburg as Commander-in-Chief.     With the  exception of Mr. BrailsforcTs article, the  &quot; Herald &quot; is fairly hopeful as to the result of the Peace  Conference.  It thinks that President Wilson is winning, and this is largely due to the support of Mr. Lloyd George and the other British delegates, but most of all because of the pressure of  Labour and Army opinion. German Colonies.     The proposal to entrust the fate of the German Colonies to the League is considered to be a hopeful  sign by the &quot; Bradford Pioneer.&quot;  Mr. Lansbury  in the &quot;  Herald,&quot; urges that it is the business of socialists and labour men to make their voices heard against any annexations on  the part  of Britain  or her Colonies.  It is the opinion of  Mr. Lansbury that the British  representatives want to do the best thing for the world, but are frightened that the British press and public opinion will not be content to come out of the war without more territory.  The &quot;  Herald &quot; advocates as part of its policy, the inter-nationalisation of the waterways, the so-called strategic points, and the  rich exploitable areas.                                    (B)-Foreign. Russia.            &apos;     The majority of the papers express their satisfaction that the Allies have at last con- sented to meet the  Bolsheviks.  The &quot; Herald &quot;  and the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; consider thatthe proposed meeting at Prinkipo is the best  compromise that could be expected since M. Clemenceau is determined that no Bolshevik shall enter  France.   George Lansbury in the &quot; Herald &quot; hopes that Lenin and his friends  will not allow a false sense of pride to keep them away ;   this is the first chance&apos; they have  had of  meeting Allied statesmen face to face and clearing up the horrible stories of outrage and murder with  which they have been charged. - Mr. Joseph King, in the &quot; Labour  Leader,&quot; says that if the Soviets accept the severe terms, it  will prove their readiness to be  reasonable, and live in a society of other nations.     Concerning  the reason for this change of policy towards Russia, the &quot; Herald &quot; gives the credit to both Lloyd George  and President Wilson.   The  &quot;Call,&quot; however, thinks it i*s not  due to  any  change of heart on the part of the members of the  Peace Conference, but  to  the persistent agitation of the socialists of England and  France.   According to &quot;Forward,&quot; the real  reason  for the proposed  Conference with  the Bolsheviks, is that these made it known that in exchange for peace they  were not averse to reconsidering their attitude to such  parts  of  the Czarist debt as were held outside  Russia.  The &quot; British Citizen &quot; and &quot; Justice &quot; still argue  that the  Bolshevik Government should not  be  recognised.   The  &quot;British  Citizen&quot;  suggests that Mr. Lloyd  George&apos;s  proposal may have arisen because he breakfasted with Mr. Henderson. European Food Situation.     According to the &quot; Herald,&quot; whatever else is going on in Russia, it is certain that the people  are starving.  This carrying on of war by starvation is considered as horrible a method of barbarism as the bombing of defenceless towns.   In the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; Mr.  C.  R. Buxton points out.what an immense peril for  the independence of nations is the  control of food supplies by a few strong powers.  Armies are  no protection against this &quot; Economic Suasion.&quot; The remedy is to secure that this formidable weapon is placed in the right hands, namely, in those of a true League of Nations.
               (2) Daily Press on Demobilisation and Discharge.There appears to be little criticism again this week of Government schemes.(G1656)                                                               A a                                (G)-Hotne Affairs.Industrial Unrest.    This subject occupies a large amount of space in the papers this week.  Two pointsespecially are emphasised.  Firstly, the need for unity of action, and secondly, the lackof an ultimate object towards which Labour should strive.  In the opinion of the &quot; labour leader,&quot; the ruling classes are reaping what they have sown.  They have taught the appealto force, and workers are now appealing to industrial force.  The &quot; Call&quot; welcomes theevidences of unrest as a first step towards the Social revolution.    Unity of action is the theme of an article in the &quot; Herald,&quot; by Mr. Robert Williams.He thinks it is  clear that direct action for -example, a 5-hours&apos; stoppage is frequentlymore  effective than five  days  of argument.  One thing  is needed, however, and  that is&quot; Unity of Command.&quot;  The Triple Alliance seems to him the most likely body from which to draw the necessary leader, and &quot; who could be more indicative of the spirit of proletarianrevolt than Smillie ?&quot;  It is clear to Mr. Robert Williams and to Mr. J. Ramsay Macdonaldin &quot;Forward,&quot; that in formulating their various unconcerted demands, the workers  will betaken in detail and smashed separately.    &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and  &quot;  Justice &quot; regret that the  magnitude of the strikes is not justified by the triviality of their immediate aim.  They look in vain for an appreciationon the part of the workman of the underlying cause of his affliction.  These papers imply that the goal towards which the workers should be striving is &quot; Social Democracy,&quot; andthe &quot; Labour Leader &quot; says that it will be  the work  of the Independent Labour Party to direct the spirit of unrest into the right channels.    In  the opinion of &quot; Forward,&quot; theLabour movements policy should include the Internationale at one end and the workshop atthe other; and it will be the work of the Independent  Labour Party to proclaim an industrial policy which will appeal to the intelligent workman,  who has no intention ofbeing a slave either to Capitalism or the State.   The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer,&quot; on the  otherhand,- believes that the industrial unrest is indicative  of something more than a desire forshorter hourSj &amp;c.  On the Clyde, and in Belfast, the appalling housing and sanitary con-ditions nave helped to create a revulsion against the existing system, and to awaken the desire for a fuller life among the workers.    &quot;Forward &quot; considers that the 47 hours was attained too easily, and therefore wasnot appreciated but only led to further demands, and &quot; Justice &quot; points out that the eon-tinuance of such concessions in  peace time will  depend under a Capitalist regime onthe state of the markets.    Those papers which  refer  to the unofficial nature of the strikes do  not think, on thewhole, that the workmen have acted wisely in throwing over their official leaders although,as Mr. Ramsay Macdonald admits, in &quot; Forward,&quot; the official trade unions failed in their duties during the war.  &quot; Justice &quot; adds &quot; It is time the official Trade Unionists bestirredthemselves to meet the new conditions ;  for no good can  come of a state of affairs in whichSyndicalists, while appealing for industrial unionism and  even for One Union, are pursuingcourses which tend to weaken the existing unions.&quot; Police and Railwaymen.     The &quot; Herald &quot; notes that the one thing that really worries the rulers,  is that thepolice can no longer  be depended on  as a weapon  of Capitalism.  The argument againstrecognition of their union namely that they are a semi-military body was used  aboutrailwaymen a generation ago.  The same  paper anticipates a railway strike in  the nearfuture, since the Coalition Government which promised Nationalisation during the election,has now been  returned with such an overwhelming majority that they seem to feel no longer forced to concede anything to Labour. National Factories.     The &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; the &quot;Herald,&quot;  and the &quot;Bradford Pioneer,&quot; continue  to protest against the Government policy.  In the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; Sir Leo Chiozza Money definitely advocates a system of State  Socialism especially in reference to the coal industry. &quot; The tremendous advantages of State Socialism as exhibited in the Government Depart- ments  of Munition, Food, and Shipping, are clear, even though they  were bureaucratic  and hastily improvised.&quot;
                        (A) Discharge of Munition Workers. Employment Outlook.     In the opinion of  the &quot; South  Wales News&quot; (29th  January)  the unemployment menace has been exaggerated;  the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;&apos; (29th January) also thinks that the unemployment figures, although higher last week,  are not large enough to cause serious apprehension.  The papers concern themselves more with  the unemployment among women than among men.  In one Manchester District the &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; (30th January) states that  there are  3,000 men and 6,500 women unemployed out  of a population of 300,000.  Fifty per cent, of the women are cotton operatives and will be reabsorbed in the mills when the supply of raw material increases.  At Woolwich, reports the  &quot; Newcastle  Chronicle&quot; (30th January),  a considerable number  of women  have registered for posts as day servants but less than half as many have registered for &quot; living- in&quot; domestic service.   &quot;The Times&quot;  (29th January)  reports that  unemployment has become so serious in the Nottingham lace trade that  a Committee has been appointed to prepare a scheme for reduced working hours. Benefits Suspended.     The &quot; Daily  Chronicle &quot; (3rd  February)  states that six discharged munition girls were offered posts as housemaids at Kirkby Stephen, but refused on the ground that the wages were inadequate.  The Ministry of  Labour thereupon  suspended payment of the unemployment benefit.                          (B) Demobilisation of the Army.     The &quot; Manchester Guardian&quot; (30th  January) is  not yet  reconciled to the new demobilisation scheme.  It  says that we have now, to a large extent, adopted the French system publicly condemned by Sir E. Geddes, of demobilising by classes, in inverse order of age.  According to the  &quot; Liverpool Post&quot;  (27th January) the attitude of the men abroad towards demobilisation has greatly improved, since the position has been explained to them, and they now recognise that demobilisation must be slow and systematic.  The &quot; Birmingham Post &quot; (31st  January) reports that a member of the crew of a Dover Mine- sweeper has been sentenced to two years&apos; imprisonment for making  a speech criticising the demobilisation scheme. Employment.     The  &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; (29th January)  points out that the next few months are critical for the harvest and implies that the shortage of skilled agricultural labourers may have serious consequences.   &quot; The  Times &quot; (3rd February) reports that the National Council in the Pottery Industry passed a resolution protesting  against the recent decision that no more pivotal men are to be demobilised as such, and warning the Government that the lack of pivotal  men will entail a dangerous amount of unemployment later on. The  &quot; Daily Express &quot; (1st  February) states that a great chemical industry is to be set up at Workington which will ultimately employ 4,000 hands.Army of Occupation.    The following criticism appears in the &quot; Daily News &quot; (30th January): &quot; The numbernamed for the Army of Occupation exceeds expectation and it is not the least of thescandals in connection with the late election that no frank word on the subject was utteredby the Government.&quot;
                PART  III. GENERAL TOPICS AND DISTRICT  REPORTS.                                 .  (^4) General.Industrial Unrest.    The  existing industrial unrest has occupied considerable attention in the papersduring the week the  &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; and  &quot; The  Times &quot;  being the most im-portant:   their comments fall roughly under two heads, (i) the  probable causes of the unrest;  (ii) the policy to be adopted towards it.  The  &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; thinks that the recent concessions which the workmen have obtained  by means of &quot; force &quot; have led them to believe that  such means can he made successful use of indefinitely ; but inthe long  run it is as true of Labour grievances as of any other, that force is no remedy ;however  sympathetic one may feel, that is no ground for  yielding to intimidation.  &quot; the times &quot; lays more stress  on the idea that it is the deliberate intention of the unofficialpromoters of the strikes to terrorise the public, and to bring about a state of affairs suchas exists in Russia to-day.   The &quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot; however, recognises that labour has just  grounds for complaint.  Labour does not get its full share of the good thingsof the world, and the balance sheets of companies during the war have shown what profitshave  been made out of the need of the people;  of  late years,  also, there has  been an increasing desire for greater&apos; economic freedom ;  and the more advanced strikers clearlywant  trade union control  of the important industries.   Further, it seems that the workersdespair of securing any reforms through the new Parliament; and the recent experiments in State Socialism have not left the happiest impressions behind them.    These continuous strike-threats can lead but to one result, the destruction of Govern-ment  authority.  As a remedy, the &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot;  says that it is the duty ofthe new Government to show that violent methods do  not pay : there is a big programmeof housing and social betterment to be carried out: and now there is no excuse for apathyor delay.  Again, the majority  of workers struck because of a genuine fear of future un-employment, especially for demobilised men ; it is, therefore, the duty of the Governmentto meet its debt to the discharged, soldiers.   As most of  the demands are reasonable, theGovernment should, speed up the process of industrial conciliation and arbitration, making it possible for demands  to be considered  through official trade union channels.   Oneserious factor is the false position the Government  has  created for itself by refusing toapply the principle of the Whitley Report to State industries.    The  prevailing note in the press appears to be approval  towards the policy of non-intervention adopted by the Government: they  attribute the actual &quot; lightening strike &quot;methods  to a revolutionary minority.Individual Views on Labour  Unrest.    Sir E. Geddes attributes the causes of  unrest to the suspicion and distrust, and the lack  of knowledge by employers and  workpeople of each  others difficulties.  Mr. WillThome in an interview at Barrow said that if the men would give the 47-hour week  afair trial, within four  months there would be a possibility of the 44-hour movement becoming a national one.  Mr. W. A. Appleton, writing in the &quot; Evening Standard &quot; (3rd February)says  that the demand for Government intervention  in disputes which affect production for export, exposes the unscrupulous attitude of the unofficial strike leaders.  The Govern-nient would have to continue the policy of  subsidy which means borrowing at high ratesof interest and increased taxation : if this is justified to preserve national existence, it is.not justified to promote industrial laxity.   The official  trade union leaders are  anxiousto secure for their members a just reward for their labour, but they know that the rewardcannot exceed the market value of the product.  The  immediate result of the currentdisturbances will be higher prices for food and other necessaries.  If the workmen refuseto  keep  their contracts, manufacturers will  stop producing, trade will stagnate and un-employment will inevitably follow.  He does not think that there are as yet sufficientfacts  to prove that a six-hour day is a practical possibility.Rousing,    The &quot; Nation &quot; last week published extracts from the &quot; Report of the Royal Commissionon the Housing of the Industrial Populations of Scotland,  Rural  and  Urban &quot; and from&quot; Scottish Mothers and Children &quot; (Carnegie Trust 1917) :  the conditions in the Lanarkshiremining districts appear to be exceptionally  bad.  At a meeting of the West Ham TownCouncil on 29th January, the disgraceful housing accommodation was said to be responsiblefor the unhealthy condition of the children.  Will Thome  stated that private enterprise
could not cope with the increased price of material and that  Government aid was im-perative.  It was decided  to  prepare  details  of  uninhabitable houses and vacant landavailable in the borough and  submit a scheme to the Government.  The &quot; Daily Mail &quot;(30th January) publishes an article  on &quot; Village  Decay.&quot;  Among other evils, marriageis totally prevented over  wide areas  for  lack of cottage accommodation.  The  paperconcludes that the hopes  of speedy Government intervention are groundless, &quot;for thetalking stage is in full career,&quot; and meanwhile the evil grows palpably worse every day.Joint Industrial  Councils.     At a  recent meeting, held  at The  Labour  Ministry, of  the  General  purposes committee  of  the Baking Joint Industrial  Council, it was  resolved  to establish  asub-committee  to draft a scheme  for the abolition of night  work.   If the committeeagree that legislation is not necessary for the time being,-application will be made for the repeal of the 12-hour-old Clause in the  Bread Order ;  if Committee agrees that legislation is necessary, the  12-hour clause is to be continued till such legislation becomes operative.It was also  resolved to ask for the necessary powers to give  effect to the decisions of theBaking Joint Industrial Council when so requested by the Council providing the Govern-ment is satisfied that such decisions are not contrary to the interests of the community.     The Joint  Industrial Council for the Silk  Trade has agreed to a three months&apos; trial of the 49-hour week.  The A.S.E., however, refuse to accept this, and claim that their members must be paid on  the 47-hour week basis.     At Birmingham a meeting was held on 29th January between the Midland Counciland the National. Union of Manufacturers and trade union leaders at which it was decidedto reject the Whitley Report and to set up local super-industrial councils representingall trades for promoting settlements  and improvements.     It is reported that the employers in the jewellery trade in Birmingham have withdrawntheir membership from the Jewellery Trade Industrial Council.     The resolution passed by the Council for the Potteries is referred to in Part II.Miscellaneous.     With reference to the recent demands set forth by the Miners Federation at Southport,a meeting of the  Management Committee of the Federation of British Industries discussed the  subject  on 22nd January. It was decided to send the following resolution to theGovernment: That no action should  be taken with reference to the  granting of these demands until  the fullest information as to their economic  effects on British industry has been obtained.     The &quot; Herald &quot; quotes from the new working conditions proposed by Division No. of the A.S.E. remarking that &quot; these speak more clearly than anything  else of the new.spirit and the new demands.&quot;  This district includes Birmingham, Leicester and Coventry.They ask for a 40-hour week  at a skilled  time-rate  of   6 ;  further, if the Trade union unemployment  register reaches 1\ per cent.,  the unions are to  reserve for themselves the right to order any reduction  of  hours  they consider necessary the weekly wage toremain unchanged.  &quot; Thus they  ask to enjoy the comparative security of tenure whichhas hitherto distinguished the salariat.&quot;                               (2?) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.     The situation in London is serious ; both the district and the tube railways being closed down.  An  agreement has, however, been arrived at, which it is hoped will result in a resumption of work.     It is reported that several members of the  Glasgow strike committee are shortlyarriving in  London to induce the  engineers to  strike.   The Executive Council of theAmalgamated Society of Engineers, on  3rd February decided to  suspend the district com-mittees of Glasgow, Belfast and London ; those who voted in favour of a strike are to be suspended for two years.   Although Sam Bradley informed  the  Press that he fears anengineers&apos; strike,  this is not the opinion of the majority particularly at Woolwich ;  theExecutive Committee are said to be dead against a strike.     It appears that there have been no complaints just recently relating to the discharge of skilled men and the retaining of dilutees.West Midlands.     Unrest has not, as yet, broken out in this district,  and it is not thought likely thatunconstitutional action will be taken.  The shop  stewards in Coventry are  likely to take steps to improve  the organisation of the workers,  it is being urged that the clerks should
be made to join a union.  Mr. Tom Dingley, who is in close touch with the Clyde leaders,strongly urges a down tools policy in connection  with  a shorter working  week.  Theemployers in the Birmingham Engineering Trades have agreed to examine every complaintdealing with diluted labour, and to ensure as far as possible, the employment of skilled *workmen.Yorkshire and East Midlands.    So far as Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire are concerned, there is no indication that the existing labour unrest has the support of the workers.  In the hosiery,lace, and even the coal mining industries, the workers are content to entrust disputes totheir official leaders, and this in spite of  the fact that very  considerable unemploymentexists in the two former trades.   The members of the  Notts  Miners Association havedecided to demand the substitution of shovels for  forks.  Trouble is anticipated at theLeeds Corporation Electricity works, where the labourers are demanding an immediateadvance of 5s. a week.  As a result of the quiet attitude of  the Leeds engineers towardsthe 47-hour week, the employers&apos; have allowed the  men to begin work up to 15 minutesafter the  authorised time.  Every section of the textile workers throughout the WestRiding is awaiting the employers&apos; reply to their demand for a 44-hour week.North-Western.    The rebel element in Manchester appears to be  making strenuous efforts to bring the engineers  out;  several of the  revolutionaries from the Clyde and from Belfast spoke at manchester during the week-end.  There is a strong body, however, who are averse to taking action for a shorter woxking week, unless  it is official with strike pay.  the officials, also are entirely against a strike.  The cotton workers in Lancashire are aiming at securing a 44-hour  week with no reduction of wages.  Trouble has arisen among thecardroom  operatives,  who claim that  the employers should pay tenters for lost  timethrough lack of material, even when these are sent home.  The question has been  con-sidered  by a Joint Committee consisting of both sides, and  a  satisfactory settlement is probable.    The  Liverpool Boilermakers,  Electricians,  Shipwrights and Joiners are stated  tohave requested the Mersey Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation to make  ademand for a 40-hour  week immediately.  The reduction in piecework prices  owing to the shorter working week  is causing much  anxiety among the boilermakers at Birkenhead.    At a  meeting of Liverpool railwaymen held on 26th January, under the auspices ofthe National Union of Railwaymen Vigilance Committee, the Prime Minister was severelyblamed for indefinitely postponing negotiations on the Railwaymen&apos;s national programme.The meeting decided to support the London men to take drastic action on 9th February,unless their demands are conceded.    Up to the present, conditions in Barrow are still tranquil, the shop stewards who arein favour  of a clown tools policy, have been overruled by the steadier section.  At theNational Conference held at Barrow on 31st January, a resolution was passed in favour ofa 44-hour  week ;  a further meeting is to be called before any action is taken.  .Northern.    The situation remains unchanged on the  North East Coast.South Wales.    ^Unrest is general  throughout the  district, and a considerable number of strikes arein progress. A. meeting  of the  A.S.E. was  held on 29th January, and although  somedrastic suggestions were made, no strong resolutions were passed.  It was suggested thatthe employers should  be asked to grant a 40-hour  week, or, failing that, a 47-hour  week with  1 a day minimum wage.  The  employers&apos; and men&apos;s representatives are meeting this week. It is believed that the industrial trouble in South Wales is fostered by the teaching  in secret classes of Syndicalism and Bolshevism;   this probably refers to theCentral Labour College classes,  those connected with them are especially aggressive in this district.Scotland.    There is an improvement in the situation at Glasgow and many workers are resumingwork.  It is said that  the movements  of the A.S.E. in London are being closely watchedby the rebels,  who are spreading the rumour that  London will support the Clyde.  TheGovernment is strongly advised not to release the arrested leaders until normal conditionsreturn ; by the end of the week it is anticipated that the revolutionaries will be defeated.
PART  IV.......DISPUTES. (a)  Involving&apos;a Stoppage of Work. Report from various Sources.             The most serious strike now in progress is that of the motormen on the London Tubes,         who are demanding that tho 30 minutes&apos; break for a morning meal, which they have been         accustomed  to  under  the 9-hour  day,  shall be  retained  under the 8-hour  day.  The         Metropolitan Railwaymen came out in sympathy on 4th February.   An agreement has been         made; which it is hoped will result in a resumption of work.             The strike on  the Clyde continues, although a  number of  men are already returning         to work.  In Belfast the situation  is still grave..             The strikes of boilermakers on  the North-East Coast and of ship repairers on the  Thames         continue.             There are a number of strikes in  progress in  South Wales,  in  almost  every branch  of         industry.  These include a strike of practically the whole of the South Wales members of the         Electrical Trades Union,  which began on 3rd February in support of their demand for a 47-hour         week and a  basis wage of 2s. and Is. 9d. per hour for the various grades.   Strikes involving         several thousand men occurred during the week at collieries in the Amman Valley (Anthracite         District), Llanbradach, and Landore, &amp;c.   TheDowlais miners resumed work on 28th January,         the management having granted all their demands.            At Barrow on 30th January, about 300 carpenters and joiners were out as  a protest against         the existence of a premium bonus system.  At Birkenhead about 400 riveters, shipwrights and        caulkers struck on 28th January at Messrs. Cammell Laird&apos;s.  A large number of smelters are       . put in Lanark.  There has been no indication that the  strike of the 4,000 boilermakers in the         Bristol Channel Shipyards has been settled.  The boilermakers at Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff,        Southampton, returned to work on 31st January pending a joint Conference.   The puddlers    \   at Netherton agreed to resume  work on 3rd February.                                   1(b) Not  Involving a Stoppage of Work.                                           -           ,Reported from, various Sources.           . The London electricians threatened to strike in London on 6th February unless the Govern-        ment brings in a Bill for a national 40-hour week and sets free the.Clyde strike leaders.&apos;  Certain        sections of the National Union  of  Railwaymen, notably London and Liverpool, threaten to        strike on 9th February as a protest against the Governments alleged dilatory method of dealing        with their national  programme.R.
