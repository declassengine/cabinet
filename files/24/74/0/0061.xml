Tho Weather and. Condition pf Crops.          The woathar during last waek continued very unfavourable fu;farm werk, ploughing and oultivating boirtg at a standstill throughoutalmost the whole oountry.   The frosts experienced in most districtsgave farmers an opportunity for carting manure, out farm workgenerally ro mains very backward everywhere.          Tho reports received do not suggest that autumn sown wheathas so far suffored to any considerable extent from the wot andchangeable weather.             Looal Organisation Divislrn*     Work of Agricultural Sxeoutiye Committees.          In view of the signature of the Armistioo and of the faotthat the powers under the Defence of the Realm Regulations which theAgricultural ilxeoutive Committees have exercised on &quot;behalf of the board will shortly he replaced by the provisions of Part IV. of theCom Production Act, 1917, the future organization of the j&amp;oqutiveCommittees has been for some time under the oareful consideration ofthe Board,   A Circular Letter has now been issued to the Committeesoutlining their future constitution.   It will still be nooOBsary tohave an Executive Committee in each oounty, but as it is very desirable that there Bhould bo nt? friction between those Committeesand tho Statutory Committees of the County Councils it has boendecided that&apos; County Councils shall be invited to nominate a majorityof the 12 ranmbors who will constitute the Sxooutivo Committee, theremaining 4 to &quot;be nominated by the Board.          Pending the appointment of those new Committees the presentCommittees are asked to continue their wsrk, and with a view to theirguidance the future policy of the Department is outlined in the letter in spite of the changed situation there is still urgent need that theincreased arable area should bo maintained and the Committees aretherefore urged to stimulate produotion in all possible directions,making a special effort to secure maximum yields from the existingarable land while at the same time improving pasture and meadow land.          The attention of the Committees is drawn in the Letter tothe possibility of a reduction in their staffs;  the cessation ofhostilities has removed the neoossity of a oompleto olaBBification ofgrass land with a view to the issue of ploughing orders and has also decided the Department to dispr.se as B:;on as possible after thospring cultivations of all Government traotors and horses for use ontho land, the heavy expense rf Government cultivation making itdesirable tc replace the present schemes by private enterprise at as early a dato as possible.          Owing to tho fact that the Food Controller has revoked the feeding of Game Ordor the Beard have revoked the Pheasants  (Rearing)Order, 1917, which prohibited oxcept under licence the hatching androaring of pheasants by any artificial means.   Tho revecati-n cfthese Orders will enable game farmers and preservers to startt-poratiens for the forthcoming season and tho action is regarded aswise as it is generally agreed that pheasants receiving a  small
quantity of grain in covert do far less harm to growing crops than the birds which are not fed.

Yorkshire (West Riding). A much neglected farm at Upper Greatland has been bought by an experienced farmer who has appealed to the Executive Committee to assist him in getting possession of the farm forthwith. The present tenant, to whose ? management the derelict condition of the farm and buildings is due, refuses to quit until he is paid £35 valuation and will not agree to a valuer. Although he is under notice to quit he can hold until 1920, and the Department has accordingly authorised the Executive Committee to take possession of the farm forthwith; the Committee intend putting in the prospective owner as their agent and he will cultivate it at his own expense until such time as the purchase is complete when the Board will determine the tenancy.

Prosecutions.

A farmer at Tyr-Capel in Breconshire has been fined £25 for failure to comply with a cultivation notice served upon him by the Executive Committee.

Allotments.

The Board&apos;s Inspectors have been active in conferring with various Local Authorities seven of whom have undertaken to acquits 65 acres which will provide 753 allotments. Nine other Local Authorities are acquiring altogether 61 acres out of which 697 allotments will be provided.

Determination of Tenancies.

During the week 6 Orders have been made by the Board determining tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 386\\3//4 acres.

Land Drainage.

Essex. At the Suggestion of the Executive Committee and with their assistance the Rainham Level Commissioners have been carrying out since the summer of 1917 the cleansing of the Mardyke. The total length of waterway to be cleared was 24 miles and of this 15\\1//2 miles have been completed by the Commissioners who have employed prisoners of war for the purpose. Owners liable have cleansed about 1\\1//2 miles and 7 miles remain to be cleansed. The cost of the work carried out by the Commissioners to the present time is about £1,500, and the remainder is expected to cost about £700. The river and its tributaries drain an area of about 30,000 acres and it is expected that the result of the work of cleansing will be to make more productive 6,000 acres of arable land and to improve 10,000 acres of pasture land. The river which rises not far from Brentwood falls into the Thames at Purfleet.

In connection with the drainage of the Wentloog Level in Monmouthshire about 4,000 yards altogether of ditching have been cleared out by the Commissioners who are employing prisoners of ? for the purpose. At this rate, it is stated that some 15 to 20 miles ought to be accomplished in one year. One of the effects of cleaning out these ditches, coupled with the casting out of Collister Pill, is to lesson the water in the flooded areas of Beridewell, Undy Common and Caldicott Moor.

    
Fruit Section, w            The annual *     meeting of  the  Spalding Bulb&apos;Growers was      attended during the week,  and as a  result  of an address  on  the      future  of Fruit Growing, considerable internet in  the Soft  Fruit  .      prospects has &quot;been aroused and the  question cf increasing the acre^i-      is to he reported on  by the Committee.               A demonstration of pruning was given at Fakenham (NorfolkN      to an audience of 35  growers.   notwithstanding a  heavy  fall of      enow, great interest  was madntained,&apos;  winter spraying, summer      spraying,  the effect  of grass en trees, end matters  concerning      diseases were also subjects discussed.               Two meetings at Tiverton (Devonshire) have  been addressed,      one on  the renovation of orchards and the  second regarding  oommon      peats and methods of  control.      Agricultural Basket^               V/illow growing s&amp;ntrce at  Newark, Sutton-on-Trent,      Becklngham and Gainsborough hare been inspected.               Heavy and continuous rains since  October  have resulted in      flood conditions,  bo  that  the labour available for cutting  has not      been fully utilised.    It  does not  however seem likely that crops      will remain untut beoauee  *        (l)   labour has been obtained through County Executive             Committees,        (2)   Men are now returning from the Army.

A  Conference  oonver ed  by the Horth^mptonshire Horticultural      Sub-Committee,  of Pan*l  Gardeners, Horticultural Representatives      and delegates  from Allotments1 Associations,  was attended during      the week.k             The meeting  was fully representative of the  county, and      discussed in particular means for obtaining additional land for      allotments,  for which there appears to be  still large demands.              The  shortage  of farmyard manure in the district was also      considered  and advice  given on the  importance of green manuring      as a substitute,  and  on  the use  of artifioial manures.

21) 3          If the PiXecutive Committee decide to make no furtherploughing orders, it ie evident that the great part of the land thathas been ploughed in this district will be allowed to revert to grass.With this possibility in vier/, arrangements have form made for a closer inspection of the area, with a view to the Beard being in aposition to advise farmers as to suitable seeds mixtures,     Farming on the Weald.   The suggestion has been made to the Bo^rdthat enquiry should be m-de as to the beet nethed of dealing with heavy clay land on the Weald.   At present much of this lnnd isindifferently farmed, and opinions differ as to the vny in whichit should be made more productive,   It is suggested, cn the one hand,that the land should be left chiefly in grass, and - devoted to stock-rearing or dairying;  on the other hand, the West Sussex AgriculturalExecutive Officer maintains that most of the land should be broken up,and put under rotational cropping, with the inclusion of long leys.The Technical Committee have appointed a Sub-Committee to visit thodistrict and investigate the whole question.                             Labour Division.     Demobilication.   The total number cf names of &quot;pivotal&quot; menin agriculture sent to the Department of Demobilisation and resettlement is 29,792,   The list closed on th- 31ot ult.          Comparatively few of these men  have so far &quot;boon released.and urgent representations are being made by the County AgriculturalExecutive Committees that the return of the -&quot;pivotal&quot; men should be expedited.   On the other hand information received from tho MilitaryAuthorities shows that to date nearly 30,000 agriculturists have beendemobilised^ but this total includes men released from AgriculturalCompanies.     Soldier Labour.    The soldiers of Agricultural Companies arebeing&quot; dexioVilieed^by the Military Authorities at a rapid r&amp;to and employers who have nc previous employees to return from the forces or whose former employees are with Units in the East vrill have difficulty in obtaining substitutes until agriculturists are more generally demobilised.                              Women&apos;s Branch.          There is no great unemployment among women of the Land Army,except in the North.   The Agricultural Executive Committee inOxford has infomed the Tenon1 s Coir-.itt.ee that there are manyvacancies for nilkere in the County which cannot be filled by men.The Organising Secretary has been informed, of the Counties wheree3:illed milkers are available .

The women who desire to continue will be visitedpersonally, in order that tho Women&apos;s Committees nay ascertain thoirwishes as to tho kind cf work they prefer, and if the Departmentagrees to.the recommendations of the Comnitteo, it is hoped toarrange Inter for further trainings, through the County Councils, tcfit the women fcr worl;,on snail holdings or us skilled labourers inthis country or in the Dominions.

Education Branch,   An unauthorised announcement in the press that the Board&quot; were offering a special grant for the assistance ofthe poultry industry has necessitated the disillusionment ef anumber of interested enquirers.          Much attention has beon given to a scheme for stabilisingand readjusting the salaries of Research workers and teachersconnected with agriculture.            i          A number- of enquiries have beon received regarding tho borasupon which grants will be available for schemes of rural agricultural

A  conference was held with the  - Principals  of Agricultural Departments of Universities and Agricultural Colleges  on the question of increased teaching facilities to meet the  emergency cemand mi demobilisation.   Most of the colleges c*o.f expect  to be.able  to meet-the demand without assistance from the Board but one or two will probably  apply for- an additional grant for extra teaching staff.   Extra accommodation will be required by others; this can, it is thought be met inmost cases by the provision of Army hutments.          21 formal applications for free Government Scholarships under the Officers Agricultural Training Scheme have been received up to date.   An early meeting of the Departmental Selection Committee Is being  called to consider these and any pthers which may be received.          13 formal applications for farm training allowances have been referred to County Education Committees.          Enquiries regarding the Soheme continue to be very numerous, and it is expected that many formal applications will come to hand shortly through the Ministry of Labour (Appointmts department). Many applicants for free Government Scholarships appear to have formed the impression that there will be numerous salaried postsavailable in agricultural education.

Meetings of the &quot;Administration&quot; and &quot;Cottages&apos;&apos; Committees, the &quot;Selection&quot; Committee and of the Board itself have been held.           The Board adopted recommendations of the &quot;Selection&quot; Committee (1) with regard to the filling of vacancies among representative members of District Wages Committees, (2.) that it was desirable to appoint one additione.1 representative of local employers, ond one additional representative of local workers rt^ the Yorkshire/District V&quot;ages Committee.   The Board also decided to give the Yorkshire District Committee on opportunity to be heard in regard to this proposal as required by the 1 iegulaftions.
             Sir  Henry Rew  presented a  report from the  &quot;Administration&quot;*&apos;  Committee  dealing  with    (a)  Action  taken for  enforcement  ef  the   minimum rates,  (b) questions  raised  with regard to tho  eoope  of the   rates,  (c) A question raised  aB  to the  granting of  ermltB  of   Exemption.             It was reported that prosecutions for non-payment of the   minimum rates  were pending In 10 oases,  and that tho information   had been actually  laid in two of tho ;cases, the hearing of  the   first  of which was expected to take  place on the 14th February,   336 complaints of  non-payment of the minimum rates had  been   received in the last three weeks, and appropriate action was  Ye ing   taken.    Arrears of wages had been secured fpr workers  amounting   for the last threy weeks t$ over  300,  and for the last two months   to over  750.             Lord Kenyan presented  a report from  the &quot;Cottages&quot;   Committee  dealing  with the deduitione by certain District  Wages   Committees under the &quot;Benefits and Advantages&quot; Order in regard tf   the maximum amount at which the  provision to a worker by his   employer ef a  defect-free cottage may be reckoned as part  payment   of minimum wages in lieu of payment  in  cash.    The recommendations   flf the Dorset,  Shropshire, Wiltshire and Anglesey and Camarvsn   District Wages Committees in  favour  of  adhering to- the  3s,  maximum   in their areas was adopted, as was also the recommendation of the   &quot;Cottages&quot; Committee that the Board*s previous determination ef   2/6 in respect of  Herefordshire  should  remain  unaltered.   A   recommendation from the  &quot;Cottages&quot; Committee that the value Qf   2/6 should be  applied to the  whole  of  Somerset was directed t? be   referred to the District Wages Committee for their consideration,   and the Board  considered and  approved  a report from  the Dorset   District Wages Committee with regard to certain Individual cottages   which  they had certified as defective,  and for which thoy  had fixed   deductions to  be made from the maximum value cf 3s.             The  Board decided to make  Orders fixing minimum  rates   for boys in Brecon and Radnor, varying  certain of the overtime   rates  for boys In  Oxfordshire, and  amending their &quot;Benefits and   Advantages&quot; Order, s^ as to give power  to the  Board  to  ascertain   and determine  the  value  of any  &quot;Benefit or Advantage&quot; in any area   where  the District Committee  for that  area failed to do so within   a reasonable time.             Considerable discussion took  plaoe on the  resumed consider-   at ion  in regard to the question  of   fixing  special  minimum rates for   market-gardening workers in Essex.    It was eventually  decided that   the Board&apos;s Notice of  the 15th October  last be abandoned,  and to  give   Notice cf Proposal to provide that  the  minimum rato  payable to male   workers of 21  years of age and  ever  employed  in market-gardens in   Essex  be 36s.  per  week  of 54  hours  in  Summer and 48  hours  in Winter   in lieu of the rates at  present  applicable.             A general discussion  took place in regard  to  the question  of   fixing rates on the basis of  oustomary hours and on  speoial difficul-   ties to which  attention  had been drawn in connection with  the   enforcement of the B^ard&apos;8 Special  ClasBOB Orders.   It  was arranged   that a Committee of the  two sides  should go  into the whole matter and&apos;   report to the  Board,                            j
          The value of Milk, Potatoes, and Board and Lodging,provided as part rpayment of minimum rates, as determined undeithe &quot;Benefits and.

During the week 161 cases of oomplaint of non*payment of the minimum rates were received, the largest number from a single county being 25 in the case cf Yorkshire;16 cases were sent to Inspectors for visit;  enquiries bycorrespondence were made in 121 cases;  and 13 cases were completed^   Reports were received from Inspectors in 16cases.

The applications for redemptionreceived continue to show a steady increase both, in number and the amount of the tithe rentcharge affected;.   Mustapplicants appear to be reluctant to go to the trouble ofobtaining particulars of the rates and land tax payable in respect of the titiie rentcharge. which they desire to redeem,   Consequently, in cases where the Baard arerequired to determine the amount of the compensation forredemption,  it is nece:sary xsr the Board tnemseovfts tcascertain these particulars either from the titheovmec orfrom the local rating and taxing authorities,,          The applications received under theCopyhold Act, 1884,  incluae a requisition under Sectitn 53of that Act involving an enquiry as to the boundaries of certain copyhold property now in course of enfranchisement-.13c

Information is reaching the Committee from many districts   as to the serious damage done by Rate.             A report has been reoeired from the Committee&apos;s   representative for -she Allendale (Northumberland) district that   Mammitis or &quot;Udda?

He further states   that the disease has become more ocmmon during the last six or   eight years than it was 20 years ago and that *altheugh 30$ more   cows are now kept than formerly, the percentage of caaeB and of   deaths is greater than it was at that time&quot;.    The  attention of the   Chief Veterinary Officer te the Board has been drawn to this matter,            &quot;Weekly Notes&quot; No* 27, has been issued during the week.                      Established ^raneft.            Much time continues to be spent in the endeavour to provide  : adeoaate accommodation fo? the staff of oetftain sections in the   Board.   At the moment i&apos;&amp; is urgently necessary to allooate further   office accommodation to the Fisheries Division,   This need was   contemplated s^me weeks ago and was made the subject of representations   to the Office ef Works.   The Board have now been offered by the   Offioe of V/ovks the tempomry occupation of No. 6, St. Jameses Square,   SfWJ.. which it is thought may offer the means ef bringing together   one or two ether sections which w.ie now unsuitably housed elsewhere.   Such houses, however, are not well adapted for offices;   they ave   built as fivet class residences, have large and palatial rooriB which   do not len$ themselves readily to adaptation as effiooe usually.            It is to be earnestly hoped that this ever-present   difficulty of accommodation may bs seriously taken in hand at a   very early date with a view to the concentration of the whele of the   Beard1-&apos; s staff in the manner suggested in previous reports.
