CIVIL   AERIAL   TRANSPORT   COMMITTEE.   INTERIM  REPORT  OF  THE  COMMITTEE  AS  TO  THE  INTERNATIONAL                      ASPECTS  OE  CIVIL  AERIAL  TRANSPORT.To the Air Council:-   1. By our terms  of  reference we  were  invited inter alia to consider the development  and regulationof civil  aerial transport from an international standpoint.    We have been informed by the Foreign office that in the opinion of that Department, if it  is desired to set on foot negotiations for the  conclusion of anInternational  Aeronautical Convention, no  time should be lost in approaching certain Allied and friendlyGovernments.   We  therefore think it desirable to submit an Interim Report on this branch of our subject at once.   2. At the outset  of our  enquiry  we found  it necessary  to divide the subjects covered  by our terms ofreference  under various heads, and to  refer  these different heads  to special committees for  detailed inves-investigation.    One of the branches of enquiry so referred comprised  international and  legal  problems,  and special  Committee No. 1, who have dealt  with these problems, have presented a report*  which, as far asit concerns international questions, has  generally been approved by us.  We think it will be found convenientthat we should enclose herewith this Report  in its entirety, and that we should draw attention to certainsalient points which  seem to us to call for emphasis or comment.    We shall deal in a further report withthe latter  part of the report  of  Special Committee No. 1, which  is  concerned  with questions of municipallegislation.   3. It  will be  observed that the Special Committee, in considering the first&apos; part of their  subject, havetaken as a basis  the  Draft International Convention drafted by the  Conference  held at Paris  in 1910(Appendix A  to their report).  This Conference  was unable to complete a  draft  convention  for ratification by the Contracting Powers, mainly owing to a conflict of opinion  between  the British and  German dele-gations as to  the right of each State to the  sovereignty  (or  to  the exercise  of  control  and jurisdiction,whichever term  be preferred) in the air space over  its territories.    In  our  opinion this question  of sovereignty is one upon which agreement between the Contracting Powers is vital  in the future interests ofcivil aerial transport.   4. It  is a question on which it is possible  to hold different opinions :  indeed,  some divergence of view with regard to it has  manifested  itself on our Committee.  It must, of course, be admitted that a state must  assert some rights of sovereignty  in the air space over  its territories, since otherwise no legal control could be exercised over aircraft  in flight at however low an  altitude, but it is possible to take  the view-either (a)  that State  Sovereignty  should be asserted usque ad coelum, or (b)^that State sovereignty  shouldbe asserted only up to some prescribed level  of altitude, above which the flight  of aircraft  would  still be practicable, and that above that altitude the air should be free to all, just as  the high seas outside the limits of territorial waters are free to all.                                            e   5. From   the purely  business point of view of the prospects of civil aerial transport, in times of peace,the latter  view has much to  recommend it.   The commercial advantages of air  traffic are to be expectedmainly from  rapid uninterrupted  flights over long  distances, and these advantages would be clearly bestsecured if  aircraft above a  certain altitude were allowed to fly freely in any direction without let or hindranceimposed upon them by  the  municipal  legislation of the States  over  whose territories they might  pass. *     *      *                             ***      *      *      *       *      *     *   G. The  argument, however,  for  the  doctrine of State sovereignty in the air space usque ad coelum isin the main a  military one.   Military considerations dictated  the opposition of the, British  delegates tothe proposals pressed by  the  German representatives at the Conference in Paris in 1910, and we understandthat the views  of the Foreign Office and  of the naval and  military advisers of the Crown  are unchanged.To give to foreign aircraft, as a  matter of acknowledged international law, the right  to fly  at will over theterritory of  the State would be to give them undesirable opportunities for espionage,  and generally to limit&quot;the  elementary right.of  a State to  take each  and every measure  which it considers  necessary for self-preservation, &quot;t   In time  of  war, moreover,  the  doctrine of the &quot;freedom of  the  air &quot; above a  certainaltitude would  give  rise to most embarrassing questions  for neutral  States.   They   would  actually  be exposed to  the risk of having aerial  battles fought over their  territory  without being  able to claim thattheir neutrality had been infringed.    The case of the upper air  presents no true  analogy to the case of thehigh seas outside the limits of  territorial waters.   7. The  experience of the  present  war has merely served to  increase  the force  of these considerations,and we agree with the Special Committee that the doctrine  of State sovereignty in the  air  space usquetd  coelum,  on  which this  country acted before the  war, and on  which, along with neutral countries, it stillacts,  is sound,  and should be adopted as  the basis alike  of  international  agreement  and  of  municipallegislation.   8. As far as the doctrine of sovereignty may be applicable  to  territorial  waters,  we  agree  with theconclusion of the Special Committee that the air space over such waters  must be considered from the same* Sec Appendix 1. p. 19,t Foreign Office memorandum enclosed in despatch to H.M. representatives abroad of 29th July, 191&quot;*.
point of view as the air space over the land of the  State.   We  desire, however, to  point out  that  tinquestions  of sovereignty over and of any extension  of the  limits  of territorial  waters  are primarily  [\concern of the Admiralty,  and that military rather  than  civil considerations must be regarded as of majolimportance in this connection.          *     *      *      *     *      *      ***      *      *      *      *     *    10. We approve tho detailed conclusions  of  the  Special  Committee set  out in Appendix  A  to  theiireport.    The technical regulations  contained in Annex  C of  the  Draft International Convention (setAppendix A) were referred  to  Special  Committee No. 2  of our Committee, and wo further  approve thciidetailed  recommendations.   Recent  developments in  the  science and  practice of aeronautics have rendered necessary some  amendments of  regulations agreed to in 1910, more particularly since such regulations wertat that date considered from the aspect of the use of airships rather than of aeroplanes.    11. In paragraph 10 (i)  of Part I. of their Report the  Special  Committee  have  touched  upon atimportant question which was  not  considered by the Conference held in Paris in 1910.   We  think that the possibility of  damage done by foreign aircraft visiting this country is a matter for careful considerationwhen it is remembered that, unless an aircraft is itself damaged, the  owner of it is in a peculiarly advan.tageous position as regards escape from the legal consequences  of his act.    We  agree  with the  SpecialCommittee that, if  some system of  insurance could  be mutually arranged between the Contracting Powers,or at least between  H.M.G. and the States whose aircraft are  most  likely to visit this  country and oveiwhose territories our own aircraft are  most likely to fly, such an arrangement would be of distinct advantagtto civil aerial transport.    12. Having regard to paragraph 10  (ii) of the Report of Special Committee No.  1,  we hold  a  strongview  that some international agreement which  will  permit of  the utilisation of aerial routes immcdiateljafter  the war is of urgent importance for the  purpose of  encouraging  civil aerial transport, and  that there.fore early steps  should be taken to enter into the necessary negotiations.    13,   *       *      *       *     Mr      Mr      *      *      Mr      Mr      *      Mr      *     *Mr      Mr      Mr      Mr      Mr     M-       Mr      Mr     *      Mr     Mr      Mr      Mr      it for the Civil Aerial Transport Committee.

70ijo              CIVIL  AERIAL   TRANSPORT  COMMITTEE.                        FINAL  REPORT   OF   THE  COMMITTEE.    The  Air Council.                                          INTRODUCTION.     1. The terms of reference under which we, the Civil  Aerial Transport Committee, were appointed ai%  is follows :       To consider and report to the Air Board  with regard  to :     1. The steps  which should be taken  with a view to the development and regulation after the War ol         aviation for civil and commercial purposes from  a domestic, and  imperial, and  an international         standpoint.     2. The extent to which it will  be possible to  utilise for  the  above purpose the  trained personnel and         the aircraft  which  the conclusion of  Peace may leave surplus to the requirements of the  Naval and         Military Air Services of the United Kingdom  and Overseas Dominions.     2. As explained in paragraph 2 of our  Interim Report on International Questions, the subjects coveredvely these terms of reference were  of such a wide  character and required so much detailed investigation thatK( re thought it advisable to divide  them into five headings, which were referred to five Special Committees.  &apos;hese headings were broadly, as follows :     1. Questions of Law and Policy.     2. Technical and practical questions  as to the possibilities of. performance  of aircraft and  as  to theseleiraer1]       requirements of aerial services.   3.  Business questions relating to the position of the aircraft manufacturing industry after the war, the       probabilities of the establishment of aerial transport services and the steps which would be necessary       for  the maintenance of this industry and  for  the development of these services.   4.  Questions of Labour arising in the aircraft manufacturing industry and in aerial transport services.   5.  Problems of scientific  research and the special education of expert designers, engineers, and pilots. he successive chapters of this.Report follow the above headings.   3.  These five  Special Committees  have all  presented reports to us, and these reports have been care- ully considered.    They contain the results of much labour and careful enquiry, and  though our  general (inclusions in the present report may not always be wholly in agreement with those expressed in the Special oinmittees&apos; reports, we have  attached them as *Appendices to this Report, in the belief that they will be ofpeat assistance to  the Air Council in the study of the various problems connected with civil aerial transport.   4.  In view of  the fact .that our Interim Report  on  International Questions dealt with the first  part of he report of Special Committee  No. 1, it would seem the most convenient course to commence the  present eport by setting out our conclusions on the problems of municipal control and legislation treated of in thescond  part  of that  Special Committee&apos;s report.  Many of the  regulations which will govern aerial-transportsill be  applicable to foreign aircraft as well as to our own/and  regulations of this character  should, in thejvent of some International Convention being arranged, be in accord with the terms of such Convention.                                         CHAPTER I.                                 Municipal Control and Legislation.   1.  The necessity for some legislation as to aerial transport is  sufficiently  indicated in the report of tecial Committee No. l.t  We adopt the view of  that Special Committee in approving the general linesupon which the  Aerial Navigation Bill (see Appendix  B to their Report) is  drawn.   Before proceedinglo a detailed consideration of its  Clauses we offer the following general observations.   2.  We think that the claim to full  and absolute sovereignty should be emphasised in the preamble to theBill for the reasons already suggested in our Interim Report.   3.  The Bill itself is drawn in such  a manner as to  leave to  Government  Departments  power  to issueregulations and to  clothe them with a considerable discretion as to the scope of these regulations.  The Billis drawn has taken the Merchant  Shipping Acts as  the  model for many of its Clauses, e.g., as to registration,certificates  of  airworthiness,  and  collision regulations.   For  this reason it is  proposed in the Bill that theHome  Office should  be responsible for  general  regulations as to  flying and for matters in which the policeire concerned, and the Board of  Trade for adminstrative regulations of the kind indicated above.   4.  The  Special Committee have expressed a definite opinion that all the powers and duties of regulatingferial transport should be assigned to the Air Ministry.   This proposal offers certain  advantages  in groupingI one  Department officials and experts responsible for  the  issue and administration of regulations, which111 the  present case must to a great extent be governed  by naval and military considerations.    As  an illus:(ration, it is only necessary to refer to the  close connection  between prescribed  landing places  for  foreignaircraft and prohibited areas.   As against the  proposal the analogy of railways and  shipping seems logically&apos;o point to the desirability of assigning aerial transport to the  Government Department primarily concernedwith trade  and commerce, i.e., to the Board of Trade.  If the  former view,  which we consider the       * These follow the Final Report and reservations as Appendices I. VII. on pp. 19 ei seq.  Appendices to the reports of theSocial Committees follow each of these reports and are lettered A, B, etc.       t Sec App3ndix I. p. 19.
  preferable one, be adopted,  some legislation in extension  of the Air  Force (Constitution)  Act,  1917, wool)  seem to be necessary to enable the Air Ministry to create the organisation required to deal with civil as distinct  from military  flying.                         ,   .      5.  The Clauses of the  Aerial Navigation Bill  itself have been closely examined by Special Commits  No. 1.    We do not propose to  deal with them seriatim,  and think it better to state that, generally speaking  subject to two modifications noted below, we  approve of  the detailed conclusions arrived  at by the Special  Committee.      6.  Of the general regulations contemplated in Clause 1,  those  which  will  prescribe prohibited zones  and landing  areas for  foreign aircraft are probably the most important.    We have already referred (inour.  Interim Report, paragraphs 5 and 9)  to the desirability  of liberal treatment in  the  admission  of foreign  aircraft to this country.      7.  The Bill adopts as the criterion of British nationality in the  case  of  aircraft the nationality of the  owner.     (See  Clause  2.)    Probably the  most difficult  problems as to nationality will arise in relation to  ownership by companies, and we desire to  draw particular  attention to  the recommendations of  Special  Committee,No. 1  as  to  the conditions  on which aircraft owned  by Companies should  be deemed to be  British  aircraft.    The provisions as to  registration  do not call for comment.      8.  We note with  approval the recommendations of Special Committee No. 1  as to limiting the necessity  for certificates  of airworthiness (see Clause  4 of the Bill).   The Clause as originally drawn would involve tht  possibility of individual aircraft  being subjected to stringent  tests  and  examinations,  which  in our  view  would be unnecessary, and  which, to  be of any use, would require to be repeated at very frequent intervals,  The question is one of considerable importance,  since the recognition of foreign certificates in the cased  international flying is  a matter which must be dealt with in any International  Convention.      9.  As to  certificates of  competency  for  navigators (see  Clause 5), we find ourselves not in  entire agree-  ment with &apos;Special Committee No. 1,  who  in their report approved Clause 5 of the Bill as originally drawn,  We  think that, while  it should be obligatory on all  navigators in  charge of  aircraft  carrying goods or  passengers to possess  certificates of competency, and while the appropriate Government Department should  have power to require  certification of  navigators in all  cases, it should be  left to such  department to decide  whether or not certification of navigators of,  e.g., private aircraft should be  enforced by  regulation.  It seems to us that the safety of the  public will probably be sufficiently  ensured by the interest of  the private navi- gator in acquiring  sufficient  skill to ensure  his own safety.  Since  certificates  of competency will be  required on  all occasions when  aircraft  of any kind are used  in flying over  foreign territory, the number of private navigators not taking out certificates  will  probably  be small,  in the  event of no regulations  being issued applicable  to them.    The  absence  of obligatory  certificates, in the  first instance, in the case of the private navigator,  seems to us to be  reasonable,in the interests of  the early development of civil flying.     10.  The  collision  and signals of  distress regulations, to the provision of  which Clauses 6  and  9 of the Bill  are directed, have already  been referred to in Paragraph  10 of our Interim Report.   We have approved the view  there  expressed that the collision rules of  the Royal Aero Club  should  be taken  as a basis for the collision regulations.   Signals of distress  regulations  are at  present the subject of expert enquiry, hi view  of the fact that  regulations of both these kinds  must be discussed  primarily  from  the  international point of view, we  do not think it advisable  to offer recommendations  of  a more  detailed nature than those contained in  Appendix A to the  Report of  Special Committee No. 1.     11.  The  recommendations  of  Special  Committee  No. 1  as to regulations relating to identification and aircraft  papers  (see Clauses  7 and 8  of the  Bill)  and as to Clauses 10  and  11  of the  Bill do  not appear to call for  any comment,                     .                  v.,     12.  Clause 12 of the Bill is of the greatest importance as affecting the general rights  of landowners in the. air space  over  their land.   This right has generally been recognised in English law to extend usque ai coelum,  and, although  some authorities have held that the right only extends to a height sufficient for the reasonable enjoyment of the  land, any  application of  the usque  ad coelum  doctrine in its entirety would be fatal to  the development of  aeronautics.    The Clause  as originally drafted in the Bill  relieved the owner of aircraft  from liability for  trespass in respect  of his flight over land in the British Islands, but preserved the common  law rights and  remedies  of persons in respect of  injury to property or person caused by the aircraft  or by any  person carried therein.    We agree  with  Special Committee  No. 1 that the clause does not proceed far enough in determining the  respective rights  and  liabilities of the owner of aircraft  and the landowner, and we adopt the suggestions of the Special Committee to extend the provisions of the  Clause in the manner  indicated in their report.    These suggestions may be looked  at from  two points of view, viz., the remedies of persons on land for trespass or material damage to their property and their remedies for nmsance.     Admittedly  persons on  land are practically powerless to ensure   their own  safety by precautionary measures against damage caused by the fall  of aircraft  or of  objects  carried  therein.  It &quot;is a  matter of some  doubt whether under  existing principles  of  law persons  suffering  such  damage  would be called on to  prove an affirmative case  of  negligence  or  intentional  trespass.   It is possible that the Courts might hold  aircraft to be  within the class of  those things which  the owner keeps or uses at his peril.    We think it preferable that  the  principles  applicable  should  be defined by legislation rather than that  they should be left for solution  by  a series of judicial decisions; we think, too, that as far as damage  done  by  aircraft is concerned the deprivation  of the landowner of what is almost certainly an  existing right of propertyshould be compensated  by what will be in effect an insurance of himself and his property against such damage. Nor do we think that in practice the  expense of insuring  himself against third party risks will  prove very burdensome to the  owner of aircraft.    As affecting the question of nuisance or trespass to the property  of the landowner in the air space above his land,, we  have  given  careful consideration  to  uhe possibility of defining some altitude, flying below which would involve a civil liability  on the owner of aircraft.  We have come to the  conclusion  that to  attempt to prescribe any such  altitude is impracticable, and that it will be sufficient to protect the landowner by giving him a specific right of action  for damages for actual nuisance caused  in breach  of  flying regulations  in themanner suggested by&apos;Special  Committee No.  1.  Sin^-e nuisances by aircraft are most likely to arise in connec-
* See Appendices IT. and III p. 41 .55    with the ascent from and landing  at aerodromes,  we recommend that special attention should be paid to   flying regulations applicable to  such ascent and landing.   13.  We do not  desire to  add anything to the  recommendations  of  Special Committee No.  1  as  to   lUSes 13-22 inclusive and Clause 24 of the Bill.   pi. With regard to Clause 23, which defines, as between the United Kingdom and the remainder  of the   pire. the extent to which the provisions of the Bill  are to apply, we desire to emphasise alike the import-   e of uniform legislation, so far as possible, throughout the Empire on aeronautical matters,  and of avoiding   . appearance of dictating to the Dominions or  of  infringing in any  way their local  autonomy.   In our   iV) the clause rightly applies universally throughout the Empire the provisions of an international charac-   -namely,  those relating to registration, collisions,aircraft papers,  and signals of distress-and  we hope   jH.M. Government will take steps to circulate the Bill, in the form in which they may themselves adopt   (o the various Dominion and Colonial Governments,  so  that the latter  may have an  opportunity of con-   ering whether they will adopt it,, with or without modifications to suit local  conditions, for their own terri-   ies, and, if so, of expressing their views as to the means  to be  employed   for  applying  it  to those   tories.   15. In  the  remaining paragraphs  of their Report Special  Committee No.  1 have  dealt with various   suggestions  relating to aerodromes.   We  approve  their recommendations, and  we would emphasise  the sug-   jtion made  in paragraph 11  of Part II. of their  Report that the clauses necessary to give effect thereto   mid be added to the Bill.                                           CHAPTER II.   Imicol and Practical Questions as  to the Possibilities of Performance of Aircraft, and  as to the  Require-                                      merits of Aerial Services.   1. The  reports of Special Committee No. 2*,  which are primarily concerned with the practical possibilities   aeronautics from a scientific and technical point of view, are in the main of  so highly technical a character   omake them unsuitable for  detailed examination in this Report.  Attached to them will be found a series  of   endices. the gener 1 effect of which has been summarised, so far as it appears possible to summarise it, by   Special Committee. We desire to record our view that the detailed reports  contained in these appendices   resent the  results  of much  experience and of much research by those most competent to express authori-    opinions on the  subjects with  which they  deal,  and that  the conclusions  at  which they  arrive are   ied upon  the most reliable data ascertainable at the present time.   2. We agree generally with these conclusions,  and strongly support the view that the carriage of mails,   passengers, and of certain  classes  of goods  by aircraft will present no difficulty from the  technical point   view.   We are confident that demands for aerial services to provide such  carriage will arise immediately   the conclusion of  the war,  and that it is imperative that  every  endeavour should  be made to prepare   these demands.   3. It is scarcely  necessary to point out the extreme importance to this  country of  being first in  the   I in the matter of aerial transport.  We concur  with Special Committee No. 2 in thinking  that an experi-   ntal service should be organised as early as possible, but this recommendation  should not  be  understood   implying that all other aerial services that may  be suggested  should await  the final results of the experi-   nt.  On the contrary, we think that special measures should be taken,  whether by direct  State effort or   the encouragement of individual enterprise,  with the object of commencing  the schemes of transport men-   ned by Special Committee No. 2  at as early  a  date as possible on the.conclusion of the war.   4. Owing to the  absence of any reliable data to serve  as a guide, it  has  been  impossible for  Special  inimittee No. 2 to frame any estimate of the running costs  of aerial services under peace conditions, and  isequently of the volume of  aerial traffic likely  to be  forthcoming.  The reasons for their inability to deal   ly with this part of  their subject are  clearly given in their final report, and we  recognise that they are  iclusive,  and that  no good  purpose would have  been served by putting forward estimated  figures of run-  ig costs which, from the nature of the case, would necessarily  have  been almost wholly the results of  esswork.   Nevertheless,  it seems  worth while  to  draw  attention  to  certain considerations affecting  the   te, if .only with  a view to pointing out the  factors which must limit the costs of aerial services if they   to hold  their own&apos; in competition with alternative means of  transport, and which are likely to limit  the  &quot;land for them.   5. It is necessary to distinguish with reference to  alternative means of transport (the alternative means   &apos;g surface transport) between developed and undeveloped  countries.  In developed countries the govern-   Wvantage  of aerial over surface transport must be  speed.  The extent of  the advantage  will vary with   effectiveness of the alternative  means, but  where alternative means exist  it must be assumed that they   he improved and rendered fully effective.   In undeveloped countries  the  advantage  will  lie with  the   2s of transport best calculated  to provide  access to points previously inaccessible, and the absence of   I or railway communication must add vastly to  the  commercial importance of the ubiquitous flightwaysf-w air.  In the  case of countries in or between which surface  transport  facilities are interrupted, as, for  Me,  where there is the interruption of a sea passage, both the factors above mentioned should operate  w advantage of aerial transport.   6.  In the paragraphs  which follow  we have regard chiefly to developed countries where aerial transport  ^led on to eclipse the speed  of surface transport.     High load and speed are antagonistic elements  in  the  problem.    To  secure high  speed, the com-  Jcial load must  be kept within  narrow  limits.  From the figures  submitted to  us  it would appear not to  eed 25  per cent,  of the total&apos;loaded weight of an aeroplane.  That is to say,  that the loading efficiency
idor the ratio oi&apos; useful load to gross weight  in an aeroplane is only poor.   On this account it would ethough  aeroplane  transport must always remain  auxiliary to surface transport, and that speed mustbe in the end the predominant factor of advantage.    8. Comparing the train  with the aeroplane,  the  train as a traffic  unit  of movement is large.must, therefore, be wider intervals of delay for  the accumulation  of loads between successive units tthe case of  the  aeroplane.  The aeroplane is a  small unit, and therefore a flow of urgent trafficgiven by a  constant  succession  of units from the aerodrome, with  consequent time  economy.  Theplane affords the better  time-saving the longer  the journeys, because in long journeys the time lost bethe home and the aerodrome is a less appreciable factor; the saving of  time  from speedy flight only coacts  this loss for journeys in excess of  some minimum  distance.    9. The  absence  of a track is a great  financial advantage.   The expenses standing in lieu thereof!less, viz., the cost of landing grounds, wireless  installations, weather-reporting  services,  and signalliroutes at night or  in  fog.  The cost of landing grounds will  only be a small factor  per &quot; aeroplane  milany  reasonable  commercial scheme of transport, but as aeroplanes become increasingly reliable  the for alighting grounds will not be wholly removed, since safety is a paramount condition ; moreover, muengined  machines, desirable  as  they are from the point  of view  of safety,  are  commercially justifiewhen the loads are great enough to warrant aircraft of this  size.    10.  In canvassing the  traffic expectations of the immediate  future,  a  distinction may be drawn bepassenger and goods  traffic.    Passenger traffic divides itself into  two distinct sections, that which  moves for business and thatmoves for pleasure.   Business traffic will turn primarily  on  speed  and reliability, and will consist of&apos;and  outward traffic where rapidity of movement is an important consideration.    Economy of timegreat importance  to  many business men who. find absence from their regular place of work disadvantaAs it becomes possible by aeroplane to fly 400 to 500 miles out and home  within the day, and  to give a able interval for the conduct of business  between the flights, so  it  becomes likely that many businesswill  avail themselves  of the opportunity.     The occasional use  of single machines for rapid journeys  in  any  direction rather than along aroute, carrying occupants who pay special  fees for the high speed,  will  probably  be one of the eariincreasing lines ,of development.  It will educate the public and prepare  them for regular services.  this be undertaken immediately peace comes, and would not  be open  to the  same objection  as any preiattempt  to run a daily service to scheduled time.      j --J.-,:..^  .   With regard to  passenger traffic generally, the question of safety in connection,  more particularlyaeroplanes  will be of the highest importance.    The large number of accidents  which occur at the ptime arc, in our opinion, chiefly  due to inexperience and  taking risks during training and  practicewould not be justified in ordinary times.  This subject is no doubt constantly  before  the authorities iexperimental departments  connected with  aeronautics, and  investigations  are, it is, understood, beingstantly  made into the cause of accidents by the Accidents&apos;  Investigation Department of the Air  MiImprovements  are continually  being made with the object of reducing accidents, and in  the  orcourse of events it is not too much to  expect*a large reduction  in. their number at the conclusionwar.    Thus the  chief  deterrent to flying becoming universal  will  be  removed  without   any  remarinvention being made.     11. Pleasure  traffic  will depend on  novelty,  comfort arid safety.   Plight may  afford pleasure iri ibut pleasure&apos; traffic  will be seasonal in.  character, will depend  largely  on weather, and will be more the more irregular it  is.  There is likely to be small regular  demand, which  will grow as flight movebecomes a habit.  The demand in the immediate future  will probably  not be extensive,  owing to  thebut it would appear  practicable  to open routes from well chosen centres.     12. Goods traffic; will be for (a) mails and (b) general goods.    Commercial  considerations are no!only ones to be taken into account in determining upon  an aerial  mail.  It is not indispensable thacost of  a letter  by aerial mail should  be fully borne by the service, if Imperial or other reasons demand the use of aircraft shall  thus be developed.  Mails offer a most promising class of traffic, because ihe lobe carried is reasonably  uniform, the weight small, and the demand for  speed great.  The  prospectsaerial mail will  be best  when the conditions referred to in paragraph 5 above as operating to  the advantsaerial transport make themselves most markedly felt.     It has been shewn in the interim  report of Special Committee No. 2 and  in Appendix E  appended ththat in the case of services between London and large provincial towns a flight of at least three hours, aaverage, say, of 100  miles an hour, is required for the speed of an  air-mail service to reveal itself, aoffer a  sufficiently marked saving of time over land transit; on an oversea journey, such as the passaDublin, the saving  of time is much  more  evident.   It would  appear  necessary to charge some such fIs. or more per letter for  an inland air-mail to prove remunerative.     The cost of electric  cable communication, say, to Johannesburg,  at   8 10s.  per  100  words  (a metaking about 24 hours to reach its destination), can be contrasted  with the  cost,  say 2s. 6d., of  sendiletter of 5,000 words to  the same spot in six days by aeroplane.   The  London mail could  in the  futur(conveyed to Calcutta in four days,  as against 16 days, the minimum at  present.  These instances ilhiS:the  intrinsic utility of air services, apart from the value of making closer links within the Empire atigiving support to the construction of aircraft so as to be ready for war emergencies.     It is more difficult to settle the reasonable expectation of general goods traffic,  which must take theof express parcels, usually of small weight. Furs, lace,  jewels, precious  metals, extracts, essences, valfeathers, etc., might be carried  by air because of their  high value; also rare and out of season fruits
c  iris&apos;(lilthenulledl:W ,blo8, flowers, and  perishable articles generally.   Newspapers and periodicals  afford scope for aerialit ajjy, because news grows stale quickly.  Drugs, dyes, chemicals,  medicines,  optical  and surgical  and    instruments  will be so carried, as often these are wanted quickly.  Wherever, for want of some article,    endangered or industry is at a  standstill,  as where some spare part or tool  is required  for a machine,    roplane will  afford  the quick remedy, and its flight  will be  profitable.  Cinematograph films,  gramo-    records and  commercial samples may figure in the class  of  goods  carried by  aircraft.    Their rapid    ution will quicken  exchange, and  this will  react to  increase the volume of traffic,  but the whole series    strations above  given tends only to show how limited the total volume or weight of aerial goods traffic    ly to be in developed countries.     The technical appendices to  the reports of Special Committee No. 2 contain interesting information    the respective capacities of the airship and the aeroplane.  We think it advisable to make some  general    trison,  from  the commercial  point of view, between the two classes of aircraft based upon this informa-     or this purpose the  largest type of airship is taken as an example, since it is found that as the  size    airship increases the ratio of its useful load  to gross weight  improves, e.g., for a  ship of sixty tons    thirty tons  of  disposable load are  available.  This represents  roughly nine  times the load carrying    ity of the largest modern  aeroplane.  The prime cost per lb. of  disposable load in the case of  an air-    s estimated at almost one-half the  prime cost per lb. in the case of an aeroplane.   The  economic limit    ? journey without landing is about 1,000 miles in  the  case  of  an airship, as against 500  miles in the   li an aeroplane.   The  airship, therefore, has the advantage of a greater load  capacity; but its speed,   1 present conditions  is  slower, being probably not more than 60 m.p.h.  In this respect the performance   ) airship on overland routes would appear in general to be open to keener competition from rail transport.   ie other hand, on sea routes the  airship will, save in  contrary winds,  have a marked advantage  over   iships as to speed.   As compared with the aeroplane, the cost of  handling and  housing airships  will be     and, until open air mooring is fully developed,  the   regularity of  airship  services   will  be more   sely affected by high winds than that.of aeroplane services.  In journeys in which speed is not the most   ial factor,  and particularly where passengers  are being carried, and safety is consequently  a paramount   leration, the airship offers advantages over the aeroplane in  the  way  of comfort,  ease  of navigation,   ily for  safe flight at low altitudes,  and high ratio of disposable  load.   1 On the  question  of  landing grounds along aerial  routes,  there was some divergence of opinion in   al Committee No. 2, and it will be observed that the interim report of that Committee is only signed by   Holt Thomas  subject to a reservation on this point.  While  we agree with the majority of the  Special   committee in not  feeling able to  recommend that chains of landing grounds should necessarily be laid out   gular  and comparatively short-say  ten-mile-intervals  along  aerial  routes, especially in  developed   dies,  we  consider,  nevertheless,  that  the  advantages  of  lines  of  landing grounds   on  certain    routes hereafter  to  be  laid  out would be  very  great,   and  that  such  lines  would  largely    the  development of  civil aerial  transport.   In  undeveloped countries  regular   chains  of landing   ids  at  suitable  intervals  along  aerial routes  will  be  indispensable;  and in  such   countries  thepri pent expense will be less material in view of the comparative  advantages which aircraft will enjoy in   etition with other forms of transport.  Regular sea stations for the landing of aircraft are at the outset   &quot;il if  trans-oceanic  aerial  transport  is to  be seriously attempted.  It is recommended that when ques-    l laying out, maintaining or abandoning landing grounds for military purposes have to  be considered,    should be had,  if possible, to the probable needs of civil aerial transport hereafter.  The establishment   iding grounds  within urban areas&apos; should not necessarily be precluded, and the  institution of  rapid transit Oi nes between aerodromes  and town centres, such as Post Offices, would be of great value.   Developments   oplane design may permit  of landing safely and conveniently within a narrow compass in the future; and   s already been  indicated, a central  situation for an  aerodrome  for civil  aerial  traffic has  considerable   rtance.y,,re:   5. We recognise, however, that military considerations must override all others,  and, though we have   arily dealt with our subject  matter mainly from a commercial point of view, we would emphasisee Importance : first, of the need that all established commercial air routes with their aerodromes and land-   laces should be  suitable&quot; for strategical and  tactical use in the event of war; and, secondly, of the need   lie rapid convertibility in  the same event of some types of commercial aircraft to military  uses.   We   it offer  detailed suggestions on these points,  which appear  to be peculiarly  within the province of the   Ministry;  but we record our strong opinion that it is vitally necessary, in the interests of national safety,   all air routes established should conform fully to military  requirements, and that the development  and   ifacture of types of commercial aircraft should for  a  long time be governed by the  requirement that   should  be  in  some manner of  effective military  use, and that this requirement should be satisfied even   e cost of a serious diminution in the commercial  value of both routes and craft.     With regard to the marking of aerial routes we agree  with the practical suggestions of Special Com-   !e No. 2.   It will be  observed that the Special Committee do not recommend the institution of a general   to of marking for the  whole country,  but  suggest that if companies operating commercial routes provide   own schemes of marking, these should be subject to some  central control for the purpose of avoiding a   He confusion arising from  the employment of different schemes.  We are  of opinion that it will not be   isary for the State to  lay down any definite scheme for the provision of route marks.  Probable improve-   s of signalling by directional  wireless  and  of other methods of signalling from aerodromes by night  and   fould seem to  make it inadvisable to  embark upon the organisation  of any universal system of arbitrary  ungs.stwI   In concluding that part of our report which  deals with the  practical possibilities of aerial transportesire to draw attention to the great importance of Meteorology  in  connection with  aerial  routes  andces generally.   The  interim  report  of  Special Committee. No. 2 deals more particularly with the dis-organisation of meteorological information,  and we propose  to  touch  upon  the  problems  of meteorological!rch at a later stage in the present report.  The practical  suggestions  contained  in the interim report  of&apos;al Committee No. 2 and in Appendices G and H to that report can be used as a basis  for a system  ofWological stations which, in our opinion, should be organised immediately after the conclusion  of the war.Tovision and ^management of  such a system are matters  which we think should be left to the State and private enterprise.
                                            CHAPTER  III.Business Questions Relating to the Position of  the Aircraft Manufacturing Industry after the War, thtybilities  of the Establishment  of Aerial  Transport  Services, and tlie Steps which would be Necessary^                Maintenance of this Industry  and for the Development of these  Services.    1. Special Committee No. 3* were concerned primarily  with business questions  relating to  the posit^the aircraft manufacturing industry after the war, with the probability of the establishment of aerialbport services and with the  effect which the  establishment of  such services might have on the maiutenafijthe manufacturing industry.    2. The Special Committee were impressed  with the importance of keeping alive the aircraft niamiljing industry in the interests of National Defence.  In order to enable the industry to respond to war ftgencies, they expressed the view in their first report that the services of the industry should continue temployed for the design and development of Naval and  Military  aircraft  and for the  carrying out olnational construction of aircraft for the future,  and that this would enable the design and construction olcraft for civil transport purposes to grow on  a sound and permanent basis.   At the same time, in  theitJreport they gave their reasons for believing that the development of  civil aerial transport services reasoJto be anticipated at the end of the  war, if no special steps are taken to foster it,  will not be sufficient tolthe manufacturing industry alive, and will not for some years  to  come  involve  any  appreciable voiuralorders being placed with the producers in this country.    3. We see  no ground for disputing this  conclusion, for though,  as we have said  in paragraphChapter II. of this  Report, we are confident  that demands for aerial services to provide for carriage oftpassengers, and  of certain classes of goods will arise at the end of the war, we  apprehend that, as wellsaid at the end of paragraph 12 of the  same chapter, the total volume of aerial goods  traffic&apos;to be antieiJwill be very limited,  and that even on the  most hopeful view of the probable extent of the demand for acarriage of mails and passengers, the number of aircraft required to  meet it will be small in comparison!the vast number now being produced for the purposes of the war.                                     I    4. The aircraft producing industry  in this country has developed during the war in a  phenomenal mailsolely owing to the unexampled demands of the naval and military authorities, and  has grown to considejdimensions in Canada also, where before the war it did not exist.                                     I    5. This great industrial organisation, amply equipped  as  it is with  capital,  material, machinery, esjknowledge and  trained labour, is  in   anything but a secure  position.   Fostered  as  it has been wlthe exceptional conditions  of the last four years, it must wither, and very rapidly, in proportion as thesetions or their equivalent cease to obtain.    6. We are thus led to consider a question raised by  General R. M. Groves at the meeting of our;mittee at which the first report  of Special Committee No. 3 was presented,  the  question, namely, olimportance in the widest  national and imperial interests of the development of the use of aircraft afterjwar.  If it appeared that the public interest  was not involved in the continued and extended use of aircthe dwindling of the aircraft manufacturing industry, with whatever  hardship to  individuals it  mightaccompanied, would not be a national disaster, but we could not  neglect  the possibility that no less vita!interest than  the  safety of the State itself might be concerned in the matter.  Accordingly we invited SfjCommittee No. 3 to report further to us on the question raised by General R. M. Groves.    7. The supplementary report! of Special Committee No. 3 appears to us to go to the root of the v.and we agree with that report in believing that  the development of civil aerial transport  services, in ordlcreate a  market for the manufacturing industry and consequently to enable it to maintain its  power oilduction and of progressive improvement in design, to the extent and for the  reasons given by the  mCommittee, is essential for  the  safety of the Empire.   We agree that aerial transport  services cannolldeveloped by  the  ordinary commercial methods so as to  secure the required result, and that State actiojsome kind in developing  aerial transport services is  therefore unavoidable.    8. As to the form of  State action to be taken, it will be observed that two main alternatives are by the Special Committee under  the heads of :-                                                    ij     (a)&apos;  State assistance to private enterprise.     (b)  State ownership  or participation in the ownership of aerial transport undertakings.The Special  Committee have not felt able to advise  as between the two alternatives;  and, similarly, we Ithat the problem, raising as it does issues  far larger and graver than  at the outset of our enquiry we fllhave  expected to be confronted with, is  one for His  Majesty&apos;s Government itself rather than for us to aimine upon.  The  choice involves the consideration of political questions, labour  questions, and question!national finance upon which a Committee constituted as  ours  is,  is hardly competent to  advise, and  wjseem appropriate for Cabinet decision.  We confine ourselves,  therefore, to saying that,  in  our opinion,form of State action to be taken  may be either of  those  described under heads (a) and (b) above, or  a combination of  the two, but that the decision in  the  matter must  rest  with  His Majesty&apos;s GovernrojThe  arguments for and  against each of these alternatives are  fully  set out in  paragraph 7 of the  snpfmentary report of the Special Committee.      9.

in-to emphasise the importance of a general scheme of main air-routes being planned in advance, so that aerial services come to be put into actual operation they may be in harmony with the scheme.10.  While considerations of national security afford the all-important reason for advocating  State action the development of aerial transport services, other advantages,  also to  be hoped for from such develop-t should not be overlooked.   Among the most  important of  the national benefits to be hoped for areeased facilities  for  friendly intercourse  with foreign  nations,  and, still more,  the improvement in  inter-nuuiication between the widely-scattered countries which make  up the British  Empire.  So far as theernments of the self-governing Dominions and of India are  concerned, it will  be for those Governments,-bom copies of this Report might, we suggest, be forwarded, to determine their own attitude in regard to problems presented by the subject of our discussions.  Whether they  decide themselves to  run  or to with  the British Government or each other in the running  of  aerial services, or not, it is in any case hoped that by arrangement with the British  Government they may be willing  to  give  all necessaryities for  the arrival and departure of British aircraft.    Such facilities would  include the  provision ofdromes and landing places or  the grant to the authorities  controlling British aerial services of the  rightcqnire them for themselves.  The Dominion and Indian  Governments would, we hope, also be willing,ss they were running State-owned aerial services of their own, to allow the British authorities to tenderheir Post Offices for the carriage of their mails, and  generally to operate  in their territory on the  same s as their own  citizens.  It has already been shown that the longer the  distances which it  is desired tor rapidly the greater are likely  to be  the  commercial advantages enjoyed by  aerial  transport for such oses as the carriage of mails as compared, e.g., with rail and steamer transport, whence it  appears thatDominions and  India, owing to their great geographical  area and  the  wide  distances which,  in  manys, separate  their  inmortant  centres  of population,  offer a fruitful  field for the development  of civilnautics. 11.  It requires  but little imagination  to envisage the possibilities  of  aerial communication  in such a try as Canada,  where the journey from Halifax to &quot;Victoria is one of nearly 3,000 miles, passing through centres  as Quebec,  Montreal,  Ottawa, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Vancouver, or in Australia, re a journey round the coast  from Brisbane to  Perth, through   Sydney,   Melbourne,  and  Adelaide is tly  longer,  or  in the Union of South  Africa, where a journey  from Capetown  to Johannesburg is one00 miles, and leads on to  Buluwayo or Salisbury, and thence across Northern Rhodesia, and  what was German East Africa, to British East Africa, the  Nile Valley,  and Cairo. It  is obvious how important aring  the improvement in inter-imperial communication  is likely to  have on that greatest of problems, problem  of  the  future relation to one another of the self-governing States of the British Empire. 12.  We are of opinion that in all matters of inter-imperial aerial traffic, as, for  instance, in  the formula- of such a scheme, of main aerial routes as is referred to in paragraph 9,  in so  far  as these routes extend nil  the limits  of  the  British  Isles, joint or  co-operative action  by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the eraments of the Dominions and of India should, wherever possible, be secured. Id  In the case of the  Crown  and other Colonies and Protectorates, the British Government is in a Ion more directly  to control the development of civil aeronautics and to secure the facilities in the way of &quot;romcs,  landing grounds, and the like,  that it requires  for the  transport in which it may be interested. any cases the Crown and other Colonies  and Protectorates, being&apos;of great geographical extent, offer the  favourable opportunities for aeronautics  that we  have  noticed in  the case of  the self-governing aions and India.  Some of  their governments may be disposed to assist  the formation of aerial transport  nies or to start  aerial services of their own.  These would be  matter  for settlement between them and  ritish Government,  but it seems to  the Committee to be likely that such  services would be valuable any remote parts of the British Empire, not only for postal, but for general administrative work, while setting up of organisations of this kind  would form valuable links in schemes of long-distance services acting the  United Kingdom  with  other parts of the Empire, and would, moreover, encourage the  design building of special types of machines suitable for  use,  e.g., on large rivers or  lakes.  In all countries, in Ji other means of communication are few and difficult, aerial  services  would  be particularly  valuable urposes of exploration and survey, owing to the remarkable developments brought about by the war in it of aerial photography.  The apparatus used has reached so high a degree of perfection that map-making. ecorrection of maps  already made,  by means of aerial photography  should  present comparatively little Wty.  Aircraft should also provide a valuable means of  aiding research in zoological  and other physical ces in many parts*of the world.  In setting up aerial services  in remote parts of the Empire the State d, we think, if necessary, assume the duty of providing  such  landing  facilities and of marking such [s as may be necessary for certain main lines.  The acouisition of the necessary land would not,  except [dnear large towns, be a matter of any great cost  or difficulty, li So far as the policy of His Majesty&apos;s  Government is  concerned,  we  desire  to lay  the  strongest pis on the necessity, to which Special Committee   No.  3 have  called attention in the last  paragraph of [supplementary report, of an early decision.  To postpone decision until after  the  war might well be jow the manufacturing industry to  languish for lack  of  orders,  and  thus  to  lose the  means  of Pg out any  policy  that  might eventually be  determined   upon.  -  If,  therefore, - His  Majesty&apos;s foment  accept  our main  proposition that  the fullest  possible development of civil aerial transport les  immediately  after  the   war is  a national  necessity,   and that it  cannot  be achieved without [action,  it will  be  necessary  for them to  settle at  once what form that  action is to  take.  If it I  take  the  form  of  assistance  to private  enterprise,   it  will  be  necessary  for His  Majesty&apos;s I-foment  to enter into communication  with  the  promoters   of   such  enterprise,  and  to  satisfy  elves as to the  sufficiency of  their  proposals.   If it  is to take  the form of direct State ownership  participation  in  aerial  transport services, it  will be necessary to settle precisely what services  are to  lertaken, and to prepare in advance all the measures  necessary for bringing  them into  operation im-  tely on the declaration of peace!  In either  event, the negotiation of  a Convention, at  any rate with  Hies, as recommended in our  Interim Report, and, probably,  the arrangement of agreements with themwn and other Governments of the Empire, to regulate  inter-imperial  and international flying,  wouldmo be indispensable preliminaries to action, and should, we venture to suggest, be taken in hand as soonfflsible.
  Questions of Labour Arising  in  the Aircraft Manufacturing Industry and in Aerial Transport Sen    1. Special Committee No. 4,* who  were concerned with labour questions connected with the prodand  use of aircraft, have  submitted a  majority report,  and a  minority report signed by the cliaMr-. H.    Wells.    2. We find ourselves in agreement with the majority&apos;s conclusion (from which Mr. Wells does notd&apos;that there are no distinctive labour problems specially affecting the industry of aircraft production ascapable of being differentiated  from those great problems connected with the relations between einjand employed generally, and in the engineering  trades in particular, which are at the preseni time re-such  close attention from other bodies  better qualified to deal with them than we are.  Similarly, wtwith the majority of the Special Committee that  the case is the same in regard to the labour to be eniin aerial transport services, which, for our present, purpose, we feel can hardly be differentiated from laboployed in other transport services. Nor do we feel that the manufacture and the prospective civil use of aigive rise to special problems peculiar to themselves in connection with the education, in the ordinary senseword,  of the workpeople engaged  therein as distinguished from expert designers  of aircraft and flyerstraining is discussed  in Chapter V. of this Report.  -  3. With a view, however, to securing that pride of craft on the part of the workman which is imivrecognised as desirable  in the aircraft industry,  in common with all other industries, we desire  to empthe necessity  for co-operation between employers  and employed in order to establish mutual  goodwill,standing,  and sympathy  in their common enterprise.  We recognise that much has already been doneidirection, but we consider that further  development and systematisation are necessary, and that theresj,bility for  this further development rests in  the first instance mainly with  the employers.    4. It is hardly within our province to attempt to indicate what precise steps should be taken toward-desired object; but  we would venture to suggest  that the popularisation among the  persons  occupied in industries concerned with the production and  use of aircraft of the great achievements and  still greater]bilities of aeronautics is specially worthy of  attention.    5. The question of  the employment in aircraft manufacture of discharged soldiers  and sailors,  i&amp;dealt with in Mr. Wells&apos; Minority Report, has, we observe,  been referred to another body, viz., tlielAdvisory Committee (Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades),  whose  report (No.  X. of the  &quot;ReportsOpenings in Industry Suitable for Disabled Soldiers and  Sailors &quot;J  has  been  issued to the public \Employment Department of  the Ministry  of  Labour in collaboration with the  Ministry of Pensions.                                            CHAPTER  V.    Problems of Scientific Research and the Special Education of Expert Designers, Engineers, and Pikkl    1. Special Committee No. 51 were concerned with the  problem of research in aerodynamics and mlology, the  sciences primarily  connected with  aeronautics, and with the problem of the,special scientific Jtion of expert designers, engineers, and pilots.                                                      I    2. Subject to the following  observations, we agree generally with their views and recommendations!we desire to lay special stress on the urgent necessity of  the  compilation of  the  bibliography and trJembodying the results of the scientific work which has already been done in aerodynamics, to which then in paragraphs 1 to 4 of their interim report.   The material available  is  voluminous but scattered.  Milit  would require for its full interpretation the assistance of various individuals who have originated or diJparticular enquiries;  and, as things stand at present, it is  a  matter of great difficulty for  a.  scientific ingator to inform himself  accurately as to what  has  already  been ascertained with regard to  any par!branch of aerodynamical  science which  he may  be studying.   It  is  an  indispensable preliminary to [Iscientific research in  aerodynamics that there should be a complete and reliable  treatise on the subject!constantly  up to date as the science progresses,  and thus  containing  in  convenient form  the&apos; whole Mlknowledge available at  any given time.  To the three main sources of existing information mention the Special Committee in paragraph 2 of their interim report we should add a fourth, viz., the  experienelknowledge of the  expert designers  now  employed by various aircraft manufacturing firms.             f    3. With regard to the method of carrying on in  the future (1) tests and investigations of finished!ducts in the shape of aircraft engines and sundries, and (2) further research including physical model jfull scale research (the subject  dealt with in paragraphs 6 to 9 of the Special Committee&apos;s interim repojappears that the choice lies between the work  being done either (a) by an organisation such as the conteropjresearch association of the  Society of British Aircraft Constructors and Aeronautical Society, which shoijfinanced by  the Society of  British Aircraft  Constructors with the assistance of grants from the Depart!of Scientific and Industrial  Research,  or (b) by a Government authority such as the National Physicalmtory,  directly financed  by the State.   We would recommend  that  the first alternative be adopted if ]mbut, failing that,  the second alternative should be resorted to.    ^ 4. With  regard to meteorology, while we agree with all that  has been said by the Special  Committee-desire to call special attention to the necessity, mentioned by them in paragraph 13 of their interim  reportensuring, co-operation between  the  Meteorological Office and  the Authorities controlling the  meteorofrfstations in the Dominions.  It is not, indeed, only the self-governing Dominions  that  are  concerned in&apos;1matter.  Similar work done by the Governments  of the Crown and other Colonies  and Protectorates maj1be of great importance, particularly in the case of long-distance routes  passing through remote parts of empire, and we  would recommend that everything possible  should be done  to strengthen  and increase efficiency of the meteorological offices  of the Colonies and Protectorates.   It would also be desirable that&apos;* See Appendix VI. p. 66.t See Appendix VII. p, 71.CHAPTER IV.
 tlU be taken to co-ordinate the work of the Meteorological Offices of groups of  Colonies and  Protectorates graphically close to one another, as,  for example,  the East  and West African groups  of  Colonios andelectorates.  Combined results are likely to bo more  valuable than the unco-ordinated results of the work number of comparatively small stations. 5. In regard to Accident Investigation, while we agree with  the Special  Committee in  paragraph 16  of r final report that  a distinction may legitimately be drawn between privately  owned aircraft and aircraft ryiug passengers for hire, we  think, nevertheless, that the  appropriate  Government  Department should A power to order an official investigation  to be held, if it is thought necessary in the public interest,  in lease of serious accident, no matter what class of aircraft may be involved in such accident.  EnquiriesMi, at the discretion of the appropriate Government Department, be conducted through the agency of  an [official body, such as the Public Safety and  Accidents Investigation Committee of the Royal Aero Club and  nautical  Society.  It appears to us that the knowledge that  a State authority was empowered to hold  an estigation  into any  case qf serious accident, if it thought fit, would give  the public a sense of security, and j thus be to the advantage  of the aerial transport industry  rather than otherwise.  It does not seem i&amp;ssary to  apprehend that a Government authority would hamper the Industry  by  directing unnecessary iijries into a number of trifling accidents arising from easily ascertainable causes.                               CONCLUDING  OBSERVATIONS.  l..In  conclusion we desire  to  point out  that  preliminary  action  has already been taken by  several our Allies  for the  purpose  of  preparing  for  civil aerial transport,  in  some  cases  by the institution [experimental postal services.  It  has been reported,  also,  that  enemy countries have moved  in this direc-  Wc  consider it of  vital  importance  that  the British Empire  should not be  allowed to lag behind her nations  in  this   movement,  more  especially  as this might  have a very serious  effect upon the wan of the  Empire  with regard  to  the international aspects of aerial transport.  We would urge that [re is a large amount of preliminary work  which could be commenced  at once.  In Chapters II.,  ,and V.  of our Report we have already indicated the urgency of  the  following  matters :-Preliminary Itiiries as to routes, landing grounds, and aerodromes, involving in the two latter  cases consultation with  I authorities; the  necessity  for  preliminary discussion with the Dominions and our Allies on the broad tstions of  principle  dealt with in  the reports of  Special Committee No. 3;  the  immediate  establishment the Bureau in aid of  Research  as suggested in the report of Special   Committee No. 5.   We consider, I that it is a - matter of urgent necessity  to establish  a  system  of Propaganda  throughout  the   3  in order to convince the whole nation of the vast  importance and  possibilities  of  aerial transport    familiarise the Governments and the  local  authorities with the subject.   There  is evidence of the Illation of such a system in enemy countries.   In  order to carry out these views  we therefore recommend that  a  special  branch  (commencing fquite a  modest  scale) should  be formed  at  once for  the  purposes  specified  under the  Air Ministry,  insure that all necessary preliminary action be taken without delay-definite responsibility being im-  i upon the  Air Council.  We would venture,  further,  to suggest that  any executive authority which  (be  established for the purpose  would be greatly assisted if an advisory panel could be formed of gentle-  nwho have given time and thought, and have expert knowledge of the problems  dealt with in our Report,  I who could be consulted as occasion demanded by the executive authority on questions arising in the course Is work.                                   .  3. The Committee desire to express their warmest thanks to Mr. Dougal Malcolm, Secretary, Mr. Tindal ipson,  Assistant Secretary, and  Mr. Harper,  Technical  Secretary, for the admirable manner in which I have  discharged their duties, and for the invaluable assistance which they  have rendered, both to  the   1 Committees and to the Main Committee, in compiling and  drafting their reports.Signed by: -I John Baird (Acting Chairman).

I think it would he unfortunate if a Report of such importance  as that of this Committee wereforward  without someone  taking  upon  himself the task of expressing  an entirely different groundwoipolicy  towards civil aerial transport to that set  out in the Interim Report of this Committee, confirmedis by further applications and developments in  the Einal Report.    -    We  are in the midst of a war of which the  concluding terms  cannot yet be foretold.  It is only natuithis time that warlike considerations  should predominate in our minds.  It is only natural  that theof insecurity should drive us towards seeking greater security  in  great  warlike measures.    That wenation and empire,  should establish our security upon a  firm  and  self-supported  basis is  acceptedcardinal  principle.  But  we are in the  midst of a war of which the  confessed object is to make thenworld  secure,  to render the appeal to the  arbitrament of war for the future of less resort and of lass and whether this object will be achieved or not is still unsettled.    Apart altogether from the mere terms which will bring this war to a conclusion, there are reactionsing which will profoundly alter the circumstances of international relationships with the peace. Some fatin these  reactions are already  apparent and  effective.  There is the revolution  in Russia, the advance in power  of labour, the political arrival of woman.  I think it is fair to say that  these factors  tend towardinternationalism of a new order, one result of which must be the collapse and  discredit of the  old diplotfIt is fair to expect that the secrecy of international  negotiations  will be done away, and with  It most ofsuspicion which secrecy always arouses ; the system of bargain and counter  bargain will be largely impossThe world and they that dwell therein must cease to be regarded as the  business assets of national firms    2. I write in the spirit of hope.  Such  a view of the future  must make the claim to aerial  sovereijwear a different aspect from that  suggested by&apos; the  Interim Report of this Committee with its  annexessovereignty of the air  is in itself  an academic  or  theoretical  question.  Each nation must be  supposehave the sovereignty in the air over its territories.  The practical question is the only important  one.is the  sovereignty  to be asserted and  exercised?  Is each nation to make its own laws and  fix its ownrand regulations, and  then, by a process of bargaining one with  another, to  secure concessions  and seta series  of more or less  favoured-nation treaties or conventions, or are the nations as a whole to agree usome  international  code  of laws,  with rules and regulations  to   follow, to  be applied  openly and  eqiiamong all nations  upon some mutually  enforceable sanction?  If causes  of offence are to be removed,second alternative is the only acceptable one.   I think, therefore,  that  in taking any steps towards the eslishment of laws or of rules and regulations  for civil aerial transport at this time care should be taken to any commitments  which  would hinder the  adoption of  the second  alternative at the  earliest favour!moment.  The door should be left open for the widest  possible conference and the most general accej* See reservation&apos;appended.

The establishment, maintenance and operation of all aircraft belonging to the State  or used for            State purposes irrespective of the particular uses to which they are put or the particular Govern-^&apos;el3         ment Departments for which they are worked (e.g., Post Office);s.  1l0Bl    2. The establishment, maintenance and operation of all aerodromes and landing grounds belonging to            the State  (I would emphasise that the State  ownership  of  aerodromes  and landing grounds            should be extended liberally  beyond bare warlike or strategic requirements);TJ I 4eeeqrede (tom3pt3.  The establishment,  maintenance and operation of all  auxiliary services  essential to aeronautics    such as weather observation and reporting  (in conjunction with the Meteorological Office),  wire-    less telegraphy,- signalling, distinguishing of routes, etc., because such services must be common    to all users of aircraft and can only be effective on a  national scale ;4. The ultimate control and responsibility for the  central  research and  experimental station.   (It is    suggested that, apart from private effort, the Government should establish a central research and    experimental station on a large scale and fully equipped to meet all the needs of the industry and    the State under a representative constitution.) 3.  There are two other selfish reasons for this policy :   (a)  The strategic position of this country in relation to the air differs  fundamentally from  the  strategic     position in relation to the sea.  So long as the shores of the North Atlantic are occupied by the leading     civilised peoples so long the British position is  advantageous as  a  centre of sea power.  But if air     power is to usurp to any degree the place of sea power-and this seems probable so long as flight over     land holds appreciable advantages over flight over sea, which is  the case under conditions  as  they     exist to-day so the position of a country placed centrally as regards land must be superior  to the     position of a country placed centrally as regards water.   The  German  aims of  Central  Europe,     Central Africa, and the Berlin to Baghdad approach to Asia are  seen to  be the more sound and the     more  dangerous as this idea is carried to fruition.  The  very scattered and discontinuous character     of the countries constituting the British Empire  becomes  an obstacle to the  development  of aerial     transport  and aerial power.  The  British Isles  are badly  placed for  aerial communication.  Other     nations bar the access to the great land masses associated to  form the British Empire.   A clear right     of way free from restriction across France and Italy  and Spain  is  essential to effective progress in     inter-colonial air communications.   Our self-interest, therefore, as  a great Power lies towards an     international settlement of air sovereignty. (b)  And for similar considerations our interest as a commercial and industrial people must lie in the same     direction.   The right to pass across other national  territory without let or  hindrance, relief from     varying terms  and conditions attaching to flight which may be  onerous and irksome, the absence of     Customs restraints or tariff  restrictions, and  generally the  absence  of the  apparatus  for  hampering     or artificially routing trade are all wanted.  On all these grounds it is submitted that the case for     an international settlement  is strengthened.therefore, dissent to the somewhat selective and particularist suggestions of the Main Committee approving,bout qualification, the report of Special  Committee No.  1. 4.  I can only  suggest that warlike considerations equally led to  the decision  to place the  control of  civilial transport with the Air Ministry, whose prime function  must  be warlike,  the   conduct  of war or of irations for  war.  The case for civil control of civil aerial transport was submitted to the Main Com- ;ee in the following memorandum (except for some slight  amendments) :- (a)  Civil aerial transport cannot be discussed apart altogether from military aeronautics.  There must be     many aspects which they have in common just  as there must be many  aspects in  which  they are     opposed.  The policy and outlook of the one have no necessary connection with the policy and outlook     of the other.   The control,  therefore, cannot be simple and  complete in  a  single hand. (b)  The root principle  of any allocation of shares in  the  control  must be to  provide separate representa-     tionof  opposed aspects and policies, to secure  adequate  and impartial  consideration,  while  at &quot;the     same  time securing common treatment of those aspects and  policies which are at one. (c)  On the analogy of  railways, shipping, canals, tramways, etc., the Board  of Trade, in its capacity as     a Ministry of  Communications, would be the fitting department of the Government to be concerned     with the commercial.and civil aspects of aeronautics.  On the contrary  analogy of the decision of     the Main  Committee, shipping should  be brought under the control of the Admiralty, and railways,     roads, and canals under the control of the War  Office in  times of  peace.   Such a step could not, I     think, be  contemplated.         The recent reorganisation of the Board of  Trade into a Ministry of Commerce and a  Ministry     of Public Utilities might be carried a stage further,  and  transport  utilities   placed  together  as  a     definite integral group  of the whole? forming a Ministry of  Communications,  and leaving gas, water,     electricity, and other supply services only to be  comprised  among public utilities.  (d) The need  for a unified and single control of those matters  which  are  similar in character and purpose     applies  with equal force here.  There are mariy common considerations relating  to the regulation     and control of  traffic quite  apart from the particular means  by  which the traffic  is carried.   The     Board of  Trade has in  the  course of time built up  an organisation and practice  for  dealing  with     these questions which a slight development would extend to cover  aerial transport.  Especial refer-     ence  may be made  to such questions as rates  and charges, preferences,  classification of commode     ties, efficiency  of and necessity for service, accidents and accident prevention,  trade agreements, etc.,     all of which have a commercial bearing rather  than a merely technical bearing.  (e) The Air Ministry would continue to be responsible for all those aspects of aeronautics,  other  than     commercial, being extended  and  developed to  the best  advantage and  generally for all  technical     aspects.   Its particular&apos;responsibilities would,  I think,  be  properly extended from purely warlike     responsiblities  to cover  : 
IS     (f)  In addition to the purely commercial questions the  Board of Trade  would appear to be the p^          Ministry to be responsible for          1. The licensing of aircraft  and pilots;          2. The investigation of accidents relating to aircraft employed for civil use;          3. The establishment of rules and regulations for aerial  traffic,  including  safety requirements)!              passenger services;          4. The licensing and inspection of aerodromes and  landing grounds  not belonging to the State.          The Air Ministry  would adopt the rules  and regulations of the Board of Trade in connection i          State-owned aircraft and aerodromes.  The rules  and regulations for aerial  navigation  and condj          generally would be a joint undertaking.  The technical inspecting officers of the Board of Trade won          be presumably seconded from the Air Ministry.  A close  relationship of  the two would necessari          exist.     (g) Finally, the administration of the law and the prosecution of  offences against the rules and regut          tions for aerial navigation or aerial  traffic would be carried out by  or  under the supervision of I          Board of Trade.  It is essential, I think, that there should be  a clear distinction  drawn between ciri          and  military administration,  particularly in relation to the enforcement of law and  order.  It wol          be an  eminent departure from constitutional practice to set up a Government Department chiefly          an executive character and primarily to carry out the work of operating aircraft for the State, \t          then permit it to undertake  the  administration of the law which  it  may itself fail to observe orfe          undertake  duties of an administrative character on behalf of privately-owned aircraft in which Sfil          and  private interest might very well be in conflict.     With this explanation,  therefore, I dissent from the recommendation of the  Main Committee that the in Ministry should have its scope and powers extended to cover civil aerial transport.     5. I submitted  to the members of Special Committee No. 3 a memorandum  setting out a connected sea of views on the question of the demand for and supply of aircraft after the war which failed to secure adonlk Without traversing  that memorandum which is on record, I think that the report of  that Committee and I report of the  Main  Committee on the subject fail to distinguish sufficiently between the actual output of air- craft by factories and factory capacity for aircraft production.     My understanding of the situation is  that aircraft of types suitable for civil use will not comply sufficient! closely with the requirements of aircraft of types for warlike purposes  to make  them effectively  interchatjt- able,  and that  aircraft of civil types  will only serve for purposes auxiliary to  military  employment prop That being so, a capacity to rapidly increase  the output of machines of military type is the desideratum,rafts than the continuous upkeep of large fleets of only partially serviceable aircraft.     It is agreed that there  must be an establishment of aircraft kept  up  wholly for military purposes ail fixed at such strength as the Government from time to time  deems essential to the national  safety.  Beji that the most material object to be assured is a capacity to produce  swiftlya sufficiency of aircraft to meetfli extravagant demands of war.     Experience in the present war has shown that many factories  and industrial  plants ordinarily engaged. upon work of a useful arid wealth-producing  character can be adanted to the  production of aircraft or parts cf aircraft  when occasion compels.   It is, therefore, strongly urged that a proper scheme should be worked til for the  co-ordination  of such factories and industrial plants as are suitable to an enlarged production before- hand, so that the change-over on the  outbreak of war may for the future  be instantly effective.   Forti purpose it may  be that modifications  should  be introduced in the lay-out and tool equipment which while net seriously prejudicial to the tasks of peace, would enhance efficiency for  the tasks of war.  Reserves of tot patterns, jigs, drawings, etc., should be held in readiness against the day of change, and should be constant overhauled and kent up to  date.     To  the extent to which auxiliary factories and industrial plants can in this way be brought  into account to bridge the enormous gap between  the normal peace and war requirements of aircraft so the problem eft aircraft  industry after the war becomes more manageable.     6. In addition to the omission indicated in the preceding paragraph, I regret that the Report of  the: Committee omits  any reference to the economic  limit which must be placed upon the expansion of aeronanfc seeing that there  is little prospect of  the immediate commercial  return  from  the operation of aircraft W sufficient to support  an adequate programme.   The burden of armaments has been heavy in the past, birf trend  of this war has been to build up a material equipment  of artillery, tanks and  other  devices for ward on land which must afterwards remain a costly addition to  the establishment. Unless, therefore, somesfef! can be taken to  limit armaments as the outcome of this war, the burden  looks  like being greater  than can borne with an army on a Continental scale, a preponderating  naval  and  aerial fleet on top of  the debt cW. consequent on the war itself.  Here,  again, until the conclusion  of this war can be reasonably foreseen, hard to pronounce for any definite policy, but a hopefulness of  outlook  is not to be put  aside as unjustil There are limiting conditions to the aircraft industry which deserve notice in  a report  of this  kind.     7. Nothing that I have said will,  I trust, be  taken  to detract from  my  concurrence  with  the i necessity of taking all measures which may be necessary for the safety and security of our  Empire in whaW situation may arise on the close of this war.    &quot;So many  points are dealt with directly or by implication in the Report of the Main Committee with ^] I  am in accord that  I have signed that Report, but my signature must  be qualified by the  observations seto&quot;in this memorandum.

APPENDIX   I.76                            Report  of  Special  Committee No.  1.jperms of Reference :-   To advise as to policy and necessary legislation, with special reference to-       (1)  The attitude to be adopted by the State with regard to national sovereignty in the air and inter-           natipnal questions connected with aerial transport.       (2) The question of  State  ownership (if  any) or of necessary State control  and  regulations as to           Customs, Quarantine, and Aliens.       (3) Necessary amendments of the common and  statute  law as to the air space covering private           property and as to compulsory purchase of land for aerodromes and landing grounds.       (4)  The principles of liability for damage caused by or  to aircraft.                                             PART I.            National Sovereignty in  the Air and  International Questions.   1. In considering this branch of the enquiry referred to them  by the Main Committee the Special Com-Jiittee have found it necessary to view the subject from  two aspects.   The first  of these relates to the generalItitude which it is thought  that His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt at any future International Confer-ice with regard to aeronautics and the second to the more detailed terms of any Convention that H.M.G. mayJe fit to agree to as one of many contracting Powers.  The Committee  recognise the fact that it would notI within the province  of the Main Committee in any  sense to prescribe to H.M.G. a complete policy govern-Ig their action at  any future International Conference.  This policy  is clearly dependent  partly upon  factors[inch do not fall within the terms of reference to the Main Committee,  as,  for instance, the relative strength [the European Powers at the end of the War and the  development  of aircraft for attack and defence on land)d sea.  In presenting their recommendations the Committee desire it to be understood that these should regarded  only from the point of view of the effect of international  policy  upon the use of aircraft for civillid commercial  purposes.2.  **  3.  The Committee do not think that, from the point of view of civil and commercial aeronautics it wouldiof much advantage to include in this report anything in the nature of  a  study or history of the much-Isputed question of sovereignty in the air  space.  They have  had the  opportunity  of considering variousIpers  in  which the right of the  State to  sovereignty in the air space over its territories, as opposed to theIctrine of the &quot; freedom of the air &apos;,&apos; is discussed.***  4.   It seems that throughout the period of the International Conference in Paris  in  1910 and up to thejrtbreak of the war H.M.G. had always maintained the position  that  every  State  should  claim full  andMute sovereignty in the air above its territories and territorial waters, and that this claim was disputed bypain of the other negotiating Powers, notably  Germany.   Since  the outbreak of war the principle of StateIvereignty over the  air has been generally claimed, and, except by Germany, recognised;  Holland, Den-Vk, and  Switzerland  have&apos; consistently regarded  the passage  of belligerent  aircraft over their territory as&apos; unneutral act,  and taken active  steps to  vindicate their rights.  5.  *     *     Mr      Mr     Mr      Mr     Mr     Mr     Mr      Mr      Mr      Mr      M-      Mr  6. It will be observed that the recommendations in the preceding paragraph do not touch upon the vexedlestion of territorial  waters.  The Committee have come to the conclusion that the claim of the  State, as[pressed in that paragraph, should apply also in respect  of  the  air  space  above territorial waters, but inp of the present uncertainty in  the determination of the limits of such waters, the Committee also recom-Md that the claim in this respect should be made applicable to any waters now or hereafter to be claimed[territorial waters.                                 j*afflippf^     \\\\ n \ l  iWIflii........... 11........           j  7. With regard to the detailed  terms of any future International Convention relating to aeronautics, theImmittee derived great assistance from a Report  of a  Sub-Committee of  the  Committee of  Imperialpence, dated 17th July, 1913.  In this Report were reviewed the terms of the  Draft Convention prepared injis at the International Conference held from May 18th to July 29th,  1910.  This Conference was  not ableIcomplete a draft convention for ratification by the contracting Powers, owing mainly to a conflict of opinionpeen the British and German delegates as  to the right of each State to the sovereignty of the  air over itsptories.  The contention of the British delegates  has already been  referred to in paragraph 4 of the presentP&apos;t.   The Draft  Convention,  as it stood when the International  Conference finally adjourned  represents1 limits within which the conferring Powers  were able to agree at the time of adjournment,
    8. In the Report of the  Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence the Draft Conventiiset out, and in a parallel column are placed the amendments and  modifications  suggested by that  Sub-Colmittee.  The Committee have thought that the most convenient method&apos; of dealing with international problemof civil and  commercial aeronautics was to consider  the  articles of the Draft  Convention  seriatim togethtwith the amendments and modifications proposed by the  Sub-Committee  of  the  Committee  of  ImperiDefence.  A translation of the text of the Convention prepared  in  the  Foreign ^ Office  by  Lord  Drogbjjjtogether with  the observations of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence and  of this Committee thereon is set out as Appendix A to the present report.  With regard to the three annexes to the Codvention which frame rules respectively as to nationality  and  registration marks, characteristics of aircraft and Rules relating to aerial navigation, the Committee,  in view of  the technical details involved and recent development of aircraft  from  the  scientific  point  of view, have thought it  advisable to refer theto Special Committee No. 2 for investigation and report.    9. At the end of the Draft Convention of 1910  will be found four recommendations which do not form part of the  text of  the Draft Convention itself.   Of these  recommendations, the  subject matter of thetwo appear  to the Committee to relate to  matters which fall within the scope of Special Committee  No.With regard to No. 3, the Committee have made a recommendation. With regard to No. 4, the Commithunderstand  that the  Conference of  1910  contemplated an International Board for  Aerial  Navigation whitshould act as  a permanent link  between the various Governments, and should collect information with a vitto the revision of the rules of the road and for questions of international  importance, but  that the  BrilDelegation did not  consider  that the time was ripe for  a permanent institution  of this kind.   In  presecircumstances it is evident that  the  possibility of establishing such an  International  Board  is  consideratmore remote than it was in  1910,  and  the Committee  do not feel that they can usefully make any  defiairecommendation on the subject.    10. Two  points have arisen for consideration which  do  not touch upon  the  text of  the Conventiitself:      (i.) It appears to the Committee that questions of  damage caused by foreign aircraft visiting this count        will have to be borne  in mind in connection with any future Convention.   For  the purpose        ensuring reparation for such damage  it might  be possible to require  all foreign  aircraft to inet        against risks of damage to  third  parties as a condition of their  registration  or  licence, as the a        may be.  The Committee think that this point  should be considered by H.M.G., particularly  in vi        of  the possibility of some mutual system of national insurance being ultimately arranged.     (ii.) As a matter of policy it will be for H.M.G. to  decide which are the Powers with  whom they        wish  to enter  into an  international agreement  of the nature contemplated in the draft conventit       **************                                               PART II.                             Government  Control  and  Legislation.    1. The control of aerial navigation after the war in the United Kingdom and  the  Empire is  a matwhich will necessitate some legislation.  Before the war the control of aerial navigation in the United Bdom was dealt with by two Acts  of Parliament,  the Aerial Navigation Act, 1911  (1 and 2 Geo. 5, C.4.)the Aerial Navigation Act, 1913 (2 and 3 Geo. 5, C.22.).    Under the first  of these two Acts  powerconferred upon the Home Secretary to prohibit the navigation of aircraft over  prescribed  areas,  and  an Orby the Home Secretary under that Act, dated 22nd September, 1913  (S.R.  and O., 1913,  No. 1090) [hibited the navigation  of aeroplanes over so much of the County of London as lay within a circle, the cerof which was Charing Cross and radius of which was four miles in length.   The  Act of 1913  extendedpower of  the Home Secretary to regulate, aircraft and provided  for compulsory  landing  of  aircraft comfrom  any place outside the United Kingdom.   Orders  and Regulations made by  the Home Secretary dafi1st March, 1913 (S.R.  and O., 1913, Nos. 228 and 243) made  provision for (a) prohibited areas;  (b) portFof the coast line prohibited to  aircraft from abroad; (c) landing areas for aircraft  from abroad; and (d)ditions imposed on aircraft from  abroad.   On August  2nd, 1914  (S.R.  and  0., 1914, No. 1117),  an Oijwas made by the Home Secretary prohibiting navigation of all, except  Naval and Military, aircraft overwhole area of the United Kingdom.  These Acts, Orders, and Regulations represent the only legislative emments made before the war. Some similar legislation had been passed in other portions of the British Emp    2. In anticipation of the  early development  of aeronautics, the Home Office, in 1911,  prepared  an kmNavigation&apos;Bill,* which represents what in that year would have been  the basis of  a complete code of Wcontrolling aerial navigation.  This Bill, a print  of which  is appended to this report as  Appendix Bbeen  of the greatest assistance to the Special Committee  in this  branch of  their enquiry, and thoughaeronautical developments render modification of some of  its  provisions necessary,  the  Special  Commiapprove of the general lines on which the Bill is drawn.    3. It has appeared to the Committee convenient to deal in the body of this  report  with the  gentprinciples on  which Government  control and  legislation should be based and to relegate to a third Appei(Appendix C) their recommendations as to matters of detail and their suggestions as to such drafting mmcations of the Bill as they think may be of assistance to the Parliamentary draftsman.    4. In the Preamble to the Bill will be found an assertion  of sovereignty and rightful  jurisdiction of Crown over the air soviet on all parts  of H.M.   Dominions  and  the territorial waters adjaithereto.  With regard to this assertion, the Special Committee  would refer  to Part I. of  their report, fgraphs 2-6 inclusive, in which  the  international aspects of  the assertion are  dealt with.*1 This BUI was in a preliminary stage of preparation and had nob been adopted by the Home Office or tho Government
w77    5.  It will be observed thai; the Bill contemplates the following Government Departments  as  taking part jn control and regulation :-the  Home  Office, the Board of Trade, Customs, and Post Office.  Of these the two last named are only concerned with particular provisions relating to Customs and mails.  The Bill pro-I poses that the Home Office should act in  imposing and enforcing general  regulations,  while to the  Board of Oracle are assigned duties as to registration, certificates of different kinds, and regulations regarding collisions, salvage, and  matters ejusdem  generis.  In so far as the powers of the Board of Trade are concerned the Bill ;s drawn largely upon the analogy of the Merchant Shipping Acts.  The creation of a new Air Ministry will afford a convenient opportunity for conferring on that Ministry the powers of the Home Office and Board of Trade to regulate aerial navigation.  The advantages of assigning to a single Department of State the regula- tioii of all matters  relating  to civil  aerial transport are manifest, and the  relevant clauses of the Bill will! require amendment accordingly.    6.  The Committee  propose  next to  deal  with the questions of principle arising  on the different clausesjof the Bill. Clause 1.                                               .    In connection with sub-section (1)  (b) of this Clause and any regulations which may be made thereunder, attention is called to the Committee&apos;s recommendations in Part I. of this report relating to Article 19 of the Draft International Convention,  and particularly to the additional rule  which the Committee  suggest should te inserted  in that  Article.  It appears to the Committee that  some caution  should be observed  in the pre- scription of areas for the  landing of foreign aircraft, so that, while every reasonable encouragement should be given to the  visits of foreign  aircraft,  reciprocal facilities should be secured for our  own aircraft landing abroad.   It has  to  be borne in  mind  that as the geographical area of the British Isles is comparatively small, it is  to  the advantage of  this country, from  the purely commercial point of view to secure free access for her aircraft  to foreign territory.  From this point of view, therefore,  a  liberal policy in  the  matter of inter- national aerial navigation for  civil purposes is indicated.   Certain verbal amendments to this Clause are sug- gested in Appendix C. (Clause 2.    The Committee appreciate the  fact  that  the broad questions of nationality and naturalisation  are being Idealt with independently of aerial navigation.  As  a matter of principle arising on (d) they think that in the lease  of companies the  true  criterion should be that the  effective  control of  the  company  for  all purposes [should be vested in British  subjects.  They refer to their recommendation on Article 3 of the  Draft Converi-  lion as equally applicable to the sub-section in question.    With regard to the ownership  of aircraft by  subjects  of British Protectorates, the Committee adopt the  suggestion of  the legal  advisers of the Colonial Office that a clause should  be added to the Bill empowering jlis  Majesty, by Order in  Council, under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act  to  apply the provisions  of the Bill, jiith any necessary adaptations, to Protectorates  and Protected  States.   The India Office  should be consulted las to whether the proposed  new clause would be  applicable to India as it stands or whether it would require Modification to apply it to the Native  States. hose 3.    The Committee think  thatVfollowing the precedent of the  Merchant Shipping Act, 1894,  the Bill should lipressly provide for local  registration in the various British Possessions. muse 4.    The Committee feel that the  question  of certificates of airworthiness is one which requires close atten-    .  Regulations  as to certificates of navigability and  reciprocal recognition by the contracting Powers of Inch certificates were contemplated in the Draft  Convention of 1910.  It appears to the Committee that for    purpose of ensuring safety for the ordinary population it is better to  provide for the competency of pilots hj stringent  regulations rather than to  run the risk of  hampering the  development  of  civil  aeronautics by liinposing on  all aircraft onerous conditions  as to tests and examination, which might possibly be imposed fritliin the  terms of- the Clause.   At the same time the  Committee  think  it reasonable  to require  that Passenger machines plying for hire must be of types the airworthiness of which has been officially certified. pe Committee therefore recommend that the provisions  of Clause 4 should only be made applicable to types   ; passenger  machines  plying for hire,  and  that this  should be made clear in the Clause itself,  and not left   exemption under the regulations.  Even  in  the case of types of  aircraft requiring  certificates of air-  worthiness the  Committee  feel that the regulations  should be  so drawn as not to hinder the  development of    m in the early days of civil  aerial transport.  The Committee think  that these conclusions  should  be  lerne in mind in the settlement  of any future Convention.  pause 5.     The Committee approve this Clause.  pause 6.     The Committee, while recognising the necessity for -collision  regulations, are  not in  a position to make  fcommendations  as to the details of such regulations, which fall within the province of Special Committee  To.  2.  In so far as the clause proposes alternative  sub-sections, the Committee  approve the second alterna-  pe sub-section (3).  As to the  alternative sub-sections  numbered (4)  the Committee are of opinion that it   1 advisable  to retain the principles governing both  the alternatives.    As  to sub-section  (5),  subject  to a  [rafting amendment noted in  Appendix C, the  Committee approve this provision, omitting- therefrom the  Wer of seizure  and  detention  as being unnecessary.  They  consider that infringements of the regulations  l&apos;e sufficiently  dealt with under the other parts of the Clause.  \kuse  7.     The Committee approve this clause  subject to some  drafting amendments suggested  in Appendix C.  \huse  8.     The Committee approve  this Clause, but they  express the view that private aircraft flying  in their own  hntry and not for hire should be expressly exempted from the obligation  of carrying  logs.
OUme, !).    Subject to the details of these regulations being considered by Special Committee  No. 2, the Commit^approve this Clause.Clause 10.    The Committee approve this Clause subject to the exceptions already suggested by  them in their reconj.mendation to  Article 33 of the Draft Convention.  (See Appendix AOClause 11.    The Committee recommend the substitution of an  alternative  clause proposed by the Secretary to ft,Post  Office, which is set out in Appendix C.Clause 12.    This Clause is very  important to private  landowners.   It  proposes to deprive  the  landowner of lyfrequently asserted right  to the air space over his land  usque ad cesium.    To retain  this doctrine injjjentirety  would be  fatal to  civil aeronautics.  On the other  hand, to allow  unrestricted flying  over  privityproperty at all altitudes would interfere with  the reasonable  rights of landowners.  The  interference wonljtake the form either of trespass or of nuisance.    The  Committee think that the  following recommendations  would,  on  the one  hand,  give  reasoiialjprotection or compensation to landowners and,  on the other, impose  on aviators  no  obligation which colnot be covered by  insurance at reasonable rates, and so avoid hampering the development of civil aeronautics.    The Committee therefore recommend that the  Bill should provide as follows :       (a) No action for trespass  should  lie except for material damage  to person or property, whether camel         by flight ascent or landing or the fall of objects from aircraft.     (b)  That this right of  action for trespass should include  one for injury caused by  the assembly of perseis         on the landing or ascent of aircraft  elsewhere than at authorised aerodromes or  landing places.     (c) That the obligation on the aviator in an action for trespass  should  be absolute, negligence not being         a necessary element in his liability and &quot;  unavoidable accident &quot; no defence.     (d)  That an action for nuisance should  lie for  damages only, and  then only  if  breach of flying fegi         tions is proved as well as actual nuisance.     (e)  That special flying regulations should be made   in  connection with  the ascent and  landing from         or at authorised aerodromes and landing plaices,  and for  the  area  around the  aerodrome or landing         place over which aircraft  must necessarily be  at low altitudes.   Nuisance  and injury to the value         of property caused by the  existence of aerodromes and landing  places are met  by paragraph llhl         this report.      (f) That the power of seizAire and detention proposed in Clause 12 should be limited to what is necessirj         to establish the identity of the aviator and  his aircraft.     Reasonable apprehensions  may  be entertained of nuisance being caused by the frequent flight of aircnll at low altitudes along regular routes, but the Committee are not  at present in  a position to make  any xem mendation as to limitations of altitude being  prescribed by regulation. Clause 13.      The Committee think that it is inadvisable to name in the Clause a fixed percentage for salvage rewalj but that the amount to be paid should be left to the discretion of the appropriate tribunal. Clause 14.         5      The Committee approve  this Clause. Clause 15.      The Committee understand that this Clause contemplates regulations which will minimise damage to * craft while under detention. As to the nature of^such regulations the Committee  have obtained advice fro Special Committee No. 2.  It  appears that the main causes of damage to aircraft under such  conditions be (i.) weather, (ii.) interference by spectators. Without making suggestions  in  detail the. Committee ttt that the regulations should provide that the person detaining the  aircraft should agree - to any reason! proposal put forward by the pilot for the avoidance  of damage, e.g., mooring the machine head to wind,fli the assistance of  earth-screws  or stakes, if such are available, and arranging  for  a  guard or other sutf means of preventing damage  by spectators.  It seems  that  the mooring  of the aeroplane is more imports than its protection from the rain, in cases where the aircraft is only to be detained for some hours. Clause 16.      Subject to  a  note in  Appendix C the Committee approve this Clause. Clauses 17 and 18.      Subject to a  drafting amendment in Clause 18, the Committee approve these Clauses. Clause  19.      The  Committee think that the language  of Section 2 of the Aerial Navigation  Act, 1913  (which cU corresponds  with this clause)  should  be substituted.  Recent experience  has shown  the  danger of forei0 aircraft flying over prohibited areas of strategic importance.  The Committee think  that the regulations CO; templated and, indeed, the Clause itself should be made more drastic, and that anyone&quot;flying over an &amp;&apos;  prohibited for naval or  military reasons should be  liable to be fired  at by  a  Commissioned Officer in char(j of an anti-aircraft gun, in his discretion, even without a preliminary signal, in a case of urgency.  Clause 20.      The Committee think that this Clause contains useful  provisions which might  well be  extended  to  British&quot; Possessions, subject to the right of the legislature of any such Possessions to alter them.  Clauses 21 and 22.      The Committee approve these Clauses.
till    $use 23.     The  Committee think that Clause 23 would  be clearer if re-cast, and that it should provide that the Actttei  &amp; regulations should apply, mutatis mutandis, throughout all British Possessions, unless and until the legis-    ture of  any British Possession otherwise provides, subject to the exception that local legislatures should not    empowered to  modify provisions of an international character, that is to say, those relating to registration,    jisions, aircraft papers, and signals of distress.WMflse 24.     It appears to  the Committee that certain provisions in the Bill, at lease those contained in Clause 12, should    ly  to aircraft belonging to His Majesty.  They, therefore, recommend that this clause should be so drafted    to make the Bill applicable to aircraft belonging to His Majesty,  except in so far as  any part thereof,   [her than Clause 12, may be excluded by Order  in Council.     7. It will be  observed that the Bill contains no provisions dealing with aerodromes or landing places.   lie Committee have considered the question whether all  aerodromes (including Flying Schools)  and landinghi&amp;ces should be State owned.   They have come to the conclusion that this is not desirable, but that, whileitjrivate persons and companies should be allowed to establish and own aerodromes and landing places,  theseateMould be subject  to Government licence, inspection, and regulation in some form.  It seems to the Committee     reasonable regulations will go  a long way towards preventing injury and annoyance to the  public,&apos; and     at the same time protect aircraft owners from frivolous  claims and proceedings.  As experience accumu-   jtes the  regulations will, no doubt, require modification and different regulations will be appropriate accord-     as the aerodromes and landing places are in populous  or sparsely-populated districts.  In licensing aero-   iomes the State will, no doubt, have regard to strategic considerations, and  provision  should be made that   jien war is imminent any privately owned aerodromes that may  have  been  allowed to be established, with   jieir equipment, should  at once be  available  for military use.  1  The Committee have already touched  upon the necessity of  some  flying regulations applicable particu-&quot;   ply to aerodromes.   With  regard to this and any other  regulations for preventing injury and annoyance   jjthe public, they  do not offer detailed suggestions, but  they think that  Section 126 of the Factory and    rkshop Act,  1901 (Special Orders) furnishes a satisfactory precedent for the scope of the powers to make  Ifffulatione. to be conferred on the  appropriate Government Department.     8. The consideration of aerodromes and landing places  involves the question of the compulsory acquisition    land for their  establishment.  The Committee are of   opinion that the  Government  should be given  liimilar rights of compulsorily acquiring  land for  aerodromes and landing  places as it  has for acquiring land  M military works.  Private  persons wishing to obtain powers for the compulsory acquisition  of land for    establishment  of aerodromes must proceed by way of  private Act  of Parliament  or provisional order.  Such powers would, presumably, have to  include powers to  cut down trees,  remove wire,  or  perform other    liar acts on adjoining land not acquired.    9.  It  is scarcely within  the province of the Committee to reoommend alterations in procedure relating  to the  compulsory  acquisition of land.  At the same time they think that  it would  be of great assistance to    development of  aeronautics  generally if  the determination  of the amount of compensation  payable  to    landowner could be made the subject of a more simple  and less expensive procedure than that at present  aiployed  in private  bill legislation.   The Light Railways Act of 1896 affords a useful precedent for the avoid-  mce of some of the  difficulties.  With regard to the amount of compensation payable to the landowners the  [rinciples  of the Land Clauses Acts have been construed to  the  landowners advantage through the estab-  lishment by recent judicial decisions of the doctrine known as  &quot;special adaptability,&quot;  whereby  the land-  iraer  can, in fact, obtain a sum representing a value greater than the ordinary market value of his  land  irhere he can show that the land is specially  adapted for the purpose for which it is being compulsorily taken.  This judicial  doctrine has in  some  instances  increased the amount payable to  landowners, and it is one which  the landowner might pray in aid successfully in the case of  the compulsory acquisition of land  for an aero-  Irome.  The Committee think that the  application of this doctrine should be specifically excluded.    10. The  Committee  have also  considered the  subsidiary question of claims for compensation by persons,  (he value of whose property has been impaired by reason of the establishment of an aerodrome in the vicinity.  They think that claims  for such compensation should be entertained at any time within five years from the   e of the establishment of the aerodrome, and that such compensation should be payable from  State funds   the case of an aerodrome established by the Government  and by the proprietor in the case of a privately owned  aerodrome.    11.  The Committee think that  the matters referred to in  paragraphs 7 to 10 inclusive,  above, should be the subject of legislation, and that as they are all matters affecting the development and regulation of aero- nautics from  the general point of view, they  can well be dealt with by the addition of further clauses to the Aerial Navigation Bill under consideration.    In conclusion, the Special Committee wish to record their warm appreciation of the assistance rendered by the  Secretaries, upon whom has fallen much work, which has been so  ably  carried out  as  greatly to facilitate their proceedings.

    Those members whose names are marked with an  asterisk  append  the following  reservations to jReport:-                                                                      &apos;:    We concur in the Report with the reservation that in our opinion State ownership of aerodromes and laning places is necessary in the interests of national defence and highly desirable, also, for commercial purpose                                                     ,                (Signed) J. Whiteside McCay.                                                                            W. P. Schreiner.    I desire to add a few words by way of  reservation  to Clause  6  of Part  II. of this Report, so far asaffects Clause 12 of the Home  Office  Bill.    Oar recommendations seem to leave it open to an aviator to fly over private  property at  any heightlikes unless actual material damage is proved, and even if a nuisance is created the aviator is still free illkeeps within certain regulations, the terms of which we have not considered.    In  my view, though the whole doctrine of the fight of the  landowner to property in the air to an indefinite height must be  curtailed, still, I am clearly of  the  opinion that the public will demand,  and rightly,limit above which (except under stress of weather)  aviators must fly  above private property, and  that anpersistent flying under this height should be  preventable by injunction.    The actual height should,  I think,  be the subject of consultation  with the other  sub-committees,,fc.probably somewhere between 2,000-3,000  feet would  be fair.                                                                   (Signed) W.  Joynson Hicks.     I concur in the Report with the following reservations, which are only made with the object of avoid&quot; restrictions which may hamper development  of  a new mode of  transport, of which very little is  known the present  time, whereas,  as experience accumulates, it will be easy to make such regulations as may necessary :- Part I., paragraph 1.     Whilst it is necessary to confer upon the  Home Secretary or other  authority the right to prohibit navigation of aircraft over prescribed areas, I  should favour the expression of an opinion from this Commit! that the prohibition of  flying over London should  be repealed,  also the regulations as to  aircraft coming i England.  Many of the regulations  made were made naturally for war purposes.   Compulsory landing of craft in England, for instance, must affect British aircraft more than any other, as it is probable that if co pulsory landing is insisted upon in England,  compulsory landing will be insisted  upon in other  countries It will be easy to make such regulations when circumstances  show that it is  necessary.   The  Committ moreover,  suggest that the powers  at present wielded by the Home Office and Board of Trade will be co ferred upon the Air&apos;Ministry,  in which  I quite concur, but it makes  it  more necessary to leave the n authority a free hand  to make such regulations as circumstances may prove necessary in the future. Part II., paragraph 6,  Clause 5.                                                             *     I see no reason at the present  time for requiring any Government certificate for private flyers, nor! restricting the use of the flying machine in this respect any more  than a motor car or boat,  especially as t public is protected by the fact that the  flyer himself is always running a greater risk than anyone else.  1 conditions  of the  Aero  Club certificate have in the past been quite sufficient. Paragraph 6, Clause 12.     Ditto.  I am not in  agreement with the Committee that  the Bill should  provide any  regulations as the altitude at which pilots should  fly.   I see no reason  to  suppose  that  in  the  immediate  future mo machines will be  in use at aerodromes than were in use previous to the war, and if  circumstances show th a great many more machines are in use, to the danger or annoyance of  the public,  such regulations as w be  necessary may then be made.  To hamper  at the present time a new development with regulations, whit might be quite unnecessary, would probably restrict development. Paragraph 6.  Clause 14.                                 .                                &apos;     I am not in agreement with  giving the Police such powers of search of aircraft and the persons there although it might  be well to give the Secretary of State power to make regulations on this point in the futu should they be necessary. Paragraph 7.   .  I am not in agreement with any control whatever  over aerodromes  and  landing places at the prese time other than  the powers which existed before the war, and  which have proved quite satisfactory  up to t present time.  Any control  must tend  to hamper the establishment of private grounds and landing place which is undesirable in the early stages of development.    The above reservations I have made solely with the object of  permitting as free as possible developntfof the use  of aircraft.  I do not,  however, foresee  any such development in  the immediate future as  vnecessitate regulations  other than those as existed  before the  war, and, in the absence of more  compleknowledge of  the  subject, I would suggest that, wherever possible, conditions  should be left as they are anour experience of the subject has so  accumulated that we have a definite knowledge  of what regulations aexpedient and desirable.(Signed)  G.

An aircraft is only governed by the present Convention if it possesses the nationality of a contracting State.  None of the contracting States shall permit a free balloon or airship to  fly  over its territory  unless  it complies  with the above condition, though special and temporary authorisation-. tion may be granted.                     Article 3.  In determining the nationality of aircraft, the  legislation of each contracting State shall base its decision either on the nationality of their owner or on his domicile in its terri- tory; the State has, moreover, the  right of requiring that the owner, if a national, shall also be domiciled in its terri- tory, and it can place on its national register aircraft owned by foreigners  domiciled  in its territory as well as those owned  by its own nationals.  If the aircraft belongs to a corporate society or joint-stock company it  can only acquire the nationality of  the  State where  the company&apos;s head  office  is situated.  In cases where the aircraft belongs to several owners the proportion of co-prpprietors who are nationals of the state or are domiciled in its territory must be at least two-thirds.                       Article 4.   When the aircraft possesses the nationality of  one of the contracting States in conformity with article 3, none of the other States can confer their nationality upon it.                       Article 5.   An aircraft will lose its nationality if the conditions under which it was granted cease to  exist.                       Article 6.   The State which confers its nationality  on an  aircraft shall  enter the latter on a register.   In  cases where the aircraft&apos;s usual station is in the terri- tory of another contracting State, the latter will immediately be notified of its registration.                       Article 7.

Articles 19 and 20 were left undecided by the Paris Con- ference.  In  1913, the Sub-Coirimittce of the Committee of Imperial Defence  suggested  the  insertion of the following Articles in tho Convention:     1. Each contracting State  shall  permit for so long  asthe present Convention is in force the aircraft of the other States to fly  within the  limits of and above its territory, subject  to   the  restrictions  laid  down in  the following rules :-   2. Each  State shall  have the right to impose restrictionson the navigation of foreign aircraft, and, more particularly, to forbid such navigation so far  as it deems necessary in order to guarantee its own security or that of the lives and property of its  inhabitants.   These restrictions shall be  applied without any inequality to the aircraft  of  every  other contracting State.   It is, however, agreed  that on. personal grounds, indepen- dent of  its nationality, a State can  exempt an  aircraft of any other contracting  State from  any one of the restrictions imposed in virtue  of the first paragraph.  3. Moreover, each State can forbid or  regulate the cross-ing  of  its frontiers,  provided that the principle laid downin  rule 1  is not violated,  and that in  every  case, exceptwhen aerial navigation is forbidden, the  extent and localityof the places where the passage of the frontier is permittedare  such  as to give access  to the  neighbouring contracting states.  4. In cases of accident verified by  an authority of thecountry where an  aircraft  has been compelled  to land, theright of access, which under  the provisions of rule  2, para-graph 1, might be forbidden,  cannot be  refused.-  The provisions of rule 2, paragraph 2, do not  apply tothe measures which, in extraordinary circumstances, a state may take to safeguard its security.  5. The contracting States undertake to adopt or  to pro-pose to their legislatures such measures as may be requiredin order to make the  private law  of their country  conform to the above provisions.  The proposed rule suggestedby the  C.I.D. Sub-committee approved  The  rule  proposed by  the C.I.D.  &quot;Sub-Committee  limitsa contracting State&apos;s right of restricting navigation by  theaircraft of other contracting states,  and prohibits  it fromdifferentiating as between  dif-ferent   foreign   contracting states.  This  proposal is opento the objection that one con-tracting  State might use its powers  of  restriction   moreseverely  than   others,    but nevertheless could not on this account    be    differentiatedagainst by the others. To meet this   objection   the  SpecialCommittee would propose  to insert the following after  thesecond  sub-paragraph:    &quot; It  is,  however,  agreedthat  any  contracting  state may refuse to accord to anyother  contracting  State any facilities which the latter doesnot  itself accord  under  itsregulations.&quot;  &quot;It is  also agreed that on personal grounds,&quot; &amp;c,  &amp;c.

Regulations  respecting Lights.                                      ARTICLE  1. .Acceptable.       The regulations concerning lights must be observed from    Acceptable.                sunset to sunrise in all weathers, and during that time no                other light must be shown which could be taken for one of                the prescribed lights.
Acceptable.Acceptable.Acceptable.       ARTICLE 2 Lights to  be  carried by  Airships.  An airship  under way, that is to say,  moving  under itsown power, must carry :    (n.) At the  bow, a brilliant   white  light arranged in        such  a manner as to throw an uninterrupted beam        over a horizontal arc of 220 degrees, that  is to  say,        from right ahead to 110  degrees on each side.  (tV.) On tlie right, a green light arranged in such a manner        as to throw an uninterrupted beam over the whole        of a  horizontal arc of 110 degrees,  that is  to  say,        from  right ahead to  20 degrees abaft the beam on        the left.  (c.) On the left, a red light arranged in  such a manner        as to throw an uninterrupted beam over the whole        of the horizontal arc of 110 degrees, that  is to  say,        from  right ahead to  20 degrees abaft the beam on        the left.  (d.) The three  lights white,  green,  and red-must be        visible in  each vertical plane corresponding to then-        respective  zones  in  each   direction,  comprised        between  the vertical  downwards and the line&apos; as        nearly as possible approaching to the vertical,  and        making an angle of  at least  30 degrees above  the        horizontal.  (e.) The green and red side lights must also be provided        with  shields or screens, arranged in such a manner        that their light cannot be seen on the opposite side.  (/.) The white light  must be visible at a  distance of at        least  4 kilom. and the green and red side lights at        a distance of at least 2 kilom. on a dark night with        a clear atmosphere.  (g.) An  airship  shall,  moreover, be  provided  with  the        means of showing occasionally a white light astern,        if overtaken by another  aircraft.   ARTICLE 3. Lights  to  be carried by Flying Machines.  The  rules relative to lights are, in principle, applicableto flying  machines, but,  as a temporary concession, they need only carry a single  lamp or  beacon, arranged in sucha manner as to show a green  light to the right and a  redlight to the left.  The  angles  of visibility in  the horizontal  must be those laid  down in  the case of airships.  So far as  the  angles ofvisibility  in the vertical  and  the minimum radius of visitors-bility of the lights are concerned, it is simply recommendedthat the  regulations  prescribed  for  dirigible balloons befollowed as closely as possible.    ARTICLE 4. Lights  to be carried  by Free Balloons.  Free balloons  must always carry ready  for  use a whitelight,  which must be displayed on the approach of anotheraircraft.                   II. Audible Siijnals                       ARTICLE  5.  (a.)  During fog, mist, snow, or heavy  rains aircraft must,by  day as well  as by night, make use of powerful, discon-tinuous, audible signals.  (b.)  In the same circumstances,  free balloons must also make use of such signals whenever they are in the neighbour.hood of  motor-driven aircraft.  (c.)  The above regulations only  apply to  flying machinessc far as is practicable.  The  regulations  containedin this  Article   are  substan.tially those which are in force at the  present  time for  thenavigation  of naval  airships,and  except  that an additionalregulation  should  be   madeproviding  for   a top   light,throwing   an  uninterruptedbeam in  a  vertical   directionupward,  the  Special   Com-mittee approve this Article.  The  present regulations  inthe case of naval and military flying  machines  provide  forport   and  starboard  lights(red and  green  respectively,but showing in each  case  a white  light   straight   ahead)and a white tail light.  Difficulty is experienced  in preventing  the lights beingmasked when viewed from cer-tain angles, and investigation is  proceeding for the  purposeof overcoming this difficulty.  It will be observed that therules laid down in this Articleare not so precise as the exist-ing   regulations,    and   theSpecial Committee recommendthat  the  international rulesshall be so drawn up, in con-sultation  with the flying  au-thorities of the Allied  Govern-ments,  as  to  include more definite  provisions as  to  the lighting  of flying  machines.  The  Special Committee  re-commend that the white lightreferred  to   in  this   Articleshould be displayed  by  freeballoons  at all times   duringthe   period   mentioned   inArticle 1.  As  regards  paragraphs  (ft)and (b) the Special Committeeare of opinion that paragraph(ft) should be made  applicableto airships and free balloons,and that paragraph (b) shouldconsequently  be deleted. &apos; With  regard to paragraph(c)   the  Special   Committeeunderstand that the&apos; difficul-ties  of providing  a   satisfac-tory audible signal as  betweenflying  machines  are  insuperable-able,  and that therefore  thisparagraph cannot stand in it&apos;present  form.   Tt is under-stood, however, that  the  pos-sibility  of   providing  aero-nlanes with magnetic  or wire-less signalling apparatus  isnow being investigated,   andshould  any  simple  system besuccessfullv devised the  Spe-cial Committee think that aninternational  regulation   en-forcing its use would  be desir-able.

A motor-driven aircraft  must  always keep at a distance of  at least  100 metres  from  another  aircraft  in  every direction, whether horizontal,  vertical,  or oblique.                        ARTICLE  7.  Motor-driven  aircraft must  always mako way for  freeballoons.                        AETICLE  8.  When two motor-driven  aircraft  are flying  on  courses which cross  in such a way as to  give reason to fear a  collisionthe aircraft which sees  the  other  on the right of  its owncourse must give way to the other  aircraft.  When, in  accordance  with the  above rule, one of  the air-craft has to change  course, the other  must keep  its owncourse and maintain its  speed.                        ARTICLE  9.  Every motor-driven aircraft which, in accordance with theabove rules, has to give way to another aircraft, must, if circumstances permit, take care not to cross in front of theother aircraft.                       ARTICLE  10.  When two motor-driven  aircraft meet head on or nearly so,  following opposite or almost opposite courses, at altitudeswhich only differ slightly, so  that a collision is to be fearedeach must turn to the right so as  to pass the other on itsleft.                       ARTICLE  11.  Notwithstanding any  of  the rules  laid down in the pre-ceding  articles, every   motor-driven  aircraft  overtakinganother must steer clear of the latter&apos;s course.  An aircraft overtaking another is an aircraft which nearsanother on a course  which meets  the  latter&apos;s  wake  at anangle of more than 20 degrees that is to say, which  is  insuch a position  in regard to the aircraft which  it overtakesthat it could not,  at night,  perceive either of the latter&apos;aside-lights.   No later change in the position of the  two air-craft can make the aircraft  which  overtakes the other con-sidered to be  crossing the latter&apos;s  route, in  the sense  ofArticle 8, nor can such change relieve  it from  the  duty ofsteering clear of the latter&apos;s course  until it has absolutelypassed  it.                        ARTICLE  12.  Whenever the necessary  manoeuvres  are not specified inthe preceding rules, the aircraft which have to manoeuvrecan do so vertically  as well as horizontally.                        ARTICLE  13.  In case  of  imminent collision,  the two aircraft  mustmanoeuvre as best they can.  In particular, the highest musttry to ascend and the other to descend.  When they are on the same level and crossing one another,whichever sees the other on the right of its own course mustascend, and  the other must descend.                        ARTICLE  14.  When an airship has stopped voluntarily,  it must displaya  conspicuous black ball;  it is  then subject to the  samerules as an  aircraft under way.  If  it is no longer  under control owing&quot;to  a  breakdown of  anv kind, it must display  two conspicuous  black ballsplaced vertically one above  the  other; it will  then be treatedns  a free  balloon.  At night  in both cases, it shall only display a white light,and shall  be treated as a free balloon,            IV. Landing and Distress Signals.                         ARTIfLT! 15.  When an  airship is about to land it must   By day, display a triangular red flag on the underside ofthe car.

Observations and Recommendations of SpecialCommitteo No. 2  of tho Civi Aerial Transport  Committee,   Articles 6 to 13 inclusive.  These   Articles,   althoMthey contain rather  more 4tailed provisions  as to thepojsibilities  of collision, closeliresemble  the  regulations fojpreventing collisions in the airdrawn up in 1912 by tho EojtAero Club,  which are in foilin the United Kingdom at thepresent time.  The  Special  Committee anof opinion  that  the  rules cjthe Royal  Aero  Club siform the  basis of the collisioirules in  any  future  Convet.tion, with the  addition of thefollowing  two  suggested rufedealing with the  possibility olcollision     between    flyjmachines  and  airships:-  1.  A flying   machine  rayalways keep at a  distance of tleast 200 metres in every diret.tion  from an  airship.  2.  Flying  machines  m&amp;always make way for airsland free balloons, and airslijjmust always make way forfeballoons.

(a,) In case of distress,  when above land  or sea, an air- ship must, so far as possible   By day, display a triangular red flag on the underside of the  car,  in addition to  the two superposed black balls mentioned in Article 14.  By night,  wave or flask  a white light,  and at the samo time extinguish the  side lights.  By day as well as by night, it can, in addition, make  useof an audible signal.  (6.)  A free balloon in distress must   By day, display a  triangular red flag on the underside of the car; and  By night, wave a white light.  By day as well as by night, it can, in addition, make use of an audible signal.   Wing  Captain Groves,  R.N.,  a member of Special Com- mittee No.  2, appended the following reservation to these recommendations:    Article 2 (/&apos;.) &quot; This Article prescribes for airships dis-  tances of at least 4 kilom. and 2 kilom. at which the white  light and  the coloured  side lights respectively  are  to  be  visible on  a dark  night with a clear atmosphere.   In  my  opinion, in view of the increased speed of aircraft,  the  rule should be amended  so as to  provide, minimum dis-  tances of visibility of 6 and  3  kilom respectively th  the  case of small airships,  and of 8 and  4  kilom  respec-   tively in the case  of large airships.  Such an amendment   is desirable  when the  very short time which  a  modern   aeroplane  takes to traverse, e.g., a distance of 2 kilom.,  is taken into account.&quot;   Lieutenant-Colonel 0&apos;Gorman, a member of Special Com- mittee No. 2,  appended the following reservation to these recommendations:       Audible Signals. &quot;In  so  far  as  these signals  are   intended to warn  aeroplanes of the presence of airships or   balloons, such signals are of little value, and if the avoid-   ance of collision with aeroplanes is one of the chief reasons   for carrying  such  signals  on airships then it  is not worth   while to impose the carrying of  the appliances for making   audible signals  on such craft;  a wireless or other signal   of more universal utility would be far preferable in time   of fog.&quot;   Special Committee No. 2  appended the following general note to their recommendations:     &quot; It will be observed that the Draft Convention contains   no  regulations as  to flying into  and out of aerodromes.  Although the general rules of the air  would apply to such  , flying, it  seems to the Special,Committee that  some aero.   drome regulations of a quite general character should be   made the subject of  international agreement.   Such   regulations as have been drawn up in the United Kingdom   are not completely satisfactory,  and the  Committee  are   not in a  position  to recommend  a detailed code.   At   certain stations the following system is in vogue for  con-   trolling inward  and outward  traffic.    Large movable   arrows are employed,, which can be illuminated at night,   and which indicate always the  direction of the  ground   wind; or, in the absence of wind, the best lie of the land.   This enables pilots who arrive to land head to wind, while   those who staTt away on a flight also do so head to wind.   Some additional  and equally simple rule  is necessarv to   prevent the possibility of  collision  between  a machine   which is spiralling down to reach the aerodrome and one   which is gliding in straight ahead, and also between in-   coming and outgoing traffic and any machine which might   be  making  practice  or  pleasure  flights  above   the   aerodrome.&quot;   Note. The following four recommendations were inserted at  the  end of  the Draft Convention for the  purpose of putting  on record the  views  of  particular delegations. although at the time the  provisions proposed had not been accepted as practicable by the Conference as a whole:-                     Be commendations   In  addition the  Conference makes the following  recom-  mendations:     1. That the Governments shall endeavour to indicate by         clearly  visible marks certain points which  can be         used as landmarks  by  aeronauts, and which should          be  placed  on the  ground, or on buildings  such as          railway stations, &amp;c   2. That the Governments shall mark visiblv and uniformlv          high  tension  electric  wires,  and the  supports of          aerial  cables, and  shall  indicate their position on         aeronautical maps of the same decimal scale in  each         country.   3. That the  regulation  of radio-telegraphic communica-         tion between aircraft,  the earth, and shios.  as well         as all Questions  of teqhnique and financial adjust-         ment, shall be submitted  to the forthcoming London         Conference on radio-telesraphv.   i. That the  Governments shall  study  the question  how         far it  would be useful to set  up an International         Board  for  Aerial  Navigation, and consider what         powers should be conferred on such a Board.      Observations and  &apos;   &apos; Recommendations of SpecialCommittee No. 2 of the Civil Aerial Transport Committee.  With regard to  paragraph(a)  the Special Committee areof  opinion that  this  para-graph should be re-drafted soas to  provide for signals simi-lar  to those mentioned in the irrecommendation in relation to article 14, but they think thatthe provision  as  to audiblesignals  by  day  and  nightshould be preserved.  With regard to  paragraph(b)  the Special Committee ap.prove these regulations.  The Special Committee arefurther of opinion that a shortregulation  should  be  addeddealing with  distress  signalsby  flying  machines,  whichmight take the form of  smokebombs or Verey lights.      Observations and Recommendations of SpecialCommittee No. 1 of the Civil Aerial Transport Committee.

                                       APPENDIX  II.                   Interim   Report   of   Special   Committee   No.   2.                                          INTRODUCTORY.     The Special Committee were requested to advise as  to  the  practical possibilities  of  aeronautics  from a  scientific and technical point of view, with special reference to certain  detailed subjects, which of necessity     for consideration in  connection with this branch of the Main Committee&apos;s enquiry.  Before these detailed  subjects are dealt with, the Special Committee think it  advisable  to  emphasise some  general  considerations.  Since aeronautics  represent in their  civil and commercial aspect an untried field of enterprise,  it is impossible  lo arrive at  very  definite  conclusions in many  of the. subjects considered by  the Special  Committee,  par-  licnlarly owing to the fact that the technical and scientific data at present obtainable are applicable to air- icraft used only for naval and military purposes, and to conditions of flight varying widely from those which I will prevail after the  war.  In this connection,  it should  be remembered that  the  whole trend of design  lias been towards efficiency in the  fighting machine, and, consequently,  there has been little opportunity for  research and enquiry into possibilities of the commercial uses of aeroplanes and airships.     Hhe same considerations apply to those branches of the Special  Committee&apos;s enquiry  which deal with   ie practical  running  of aerial services on  commercial lines.     With  regard  to the detailed subjects assigned for consideration by  the  Special  Committee,  these have-.  been in  most cases referred either to small sub-committees or individual members of the Special Committee,  and the present report is  intended to present the conclusions which can be drawn from the materials supplied    this manner.   The Main Committee will observe that  it has not been possible as yet to cover the whole  lekl of enquiry, but it has been thought that the conclusions at present reached can conveniently be sum-    arised in an interim report.  It  is, therefore, proposed  to deal  with  the different  items of the terms of    ference to the Special Committee in order.    The  possibilities  of  the employment of aircraft at present  and  in  the  near  future  in  transporting     passengers, mails, and parcels with the estimated  limits  of  their range, weight, carrying capacity, and     running costs, based on the assumption of  reasonable  State regulation of air traffic, and the probability     or otherwise of the use of privately owned aircraft  by  individuals  for pleasure or other purposes.                                      TYPES OF AIRCRAFT.     In considering the possibilities  of the employment of  aircraft for purposes of the transport of passengers,    nails and parcels, the Special Committee directed an enquiry*  to be made as to (i.) four existing  types of  j aeroplane, and (ii.) rigid airships.  These were  made the subject of reports by Col. 0&apos;Gorman and Mr.  Bair-  Istow, as to  the aeroplanes, and by Wing  Captain Maitland, as  to the airships, which  are  appended to the   present Report as Appendices A.  and B.   With regard to aeroplanes, the following  four types were  selected,  l,ra. :-       (i.)  The PTandley-Page, with 250 h.p. Rolls-Royce engines, and the &quot; America &quot; flying boat.      (ii.)  The de Havilland 4, with 250 h.p. Rolls-Royce engine or 230 h.p. B.H.P. engine.      (iii.)  The R.R. 8, with the R.A.F. 150 h.p. air-cooled engine.      (iv.)  The Sopwith &quot;Pup,&quot;  with an  80 h.p.  Le Rhone engine.    These types were selected to cover the whole range of well-known machines with a view to estimating the    possibilities of transport from existing data,      Colonel 0&apos;Gorman and  Mr. Bairstow presented the  following general  conclusions to the Special  Com-    ffiittee on the hypothesis  of aerial transport in still air.      A. It is profitable, so far as  fuel consumption is concerned, to fly high.      B. It is profitable, so far as  fuel consumption is  concerned and  so far  as the cost  of aeroplane  construc-          tion is concerned, to use a heavy loading of the wings.      C. Since  high-wing  loading  means  fast  alighting, the provision of  first-class grounds will, it is con-          sidered,  lead to economy of transport.   Your  Sub-Committee contemplates landing speeds upwards          of 60 m.p.h.  This does not refer to seaplanes or flying boats.      D. High speed of  flight is in direct conflict with great weight carrying capacity.      E. It  follows from D  that,  in selecting  the flying speed of the aeroplane to be used, a compromise must           be struck between the value of (a) fuel and labour economy  and  (b) speed or time saving.      F. As illustrating E,  a lightly loaded aeroplane, such  as is commonly  used  now, cannot possibly at           120 m.p.h.  (low level speed)  fly 1,000 miles, that is to say, there will be no lift available to carry even           the flyer; whereas, at 80 m.p.h., no less than 30 per cent, of the gross  weight of the aeroplane           becomes available for crew and  commercial load.      Cr.  The comparatively small  importance of rapid climbing in commercial  air work will make the  possi-           bilities of combining high speed and weight-carrying  much better than  those  of the modern  service           aeroplane.  .      H. The cost of production of aeroplanes  (taken over the range of  variations of type presented by the fouriViJI       service  aeroplanes selected and based on quotations for large quantities) is roughly proportional to           the total crew and useful load carried ; and this in turn is equally proportional to the total gross loaded           weight  of the aeroplane, viz., at war prices about^ 900 per every 1,000 lbs. of gross weight.       With  regard  to conclusion F,  it  was  pointed  out by way of  explanation in  a  supplementary note    M  the  end  of  Appendix  A)  that  a  comparison  is   drawn  therein  not  between  two  performances    I one machine, but between performances of two different machines, one  designed to fly at 120 m.p.h., and    foe other at 80  m.p.h.  Particular attention  is drawn to the tables annexed to this Report.:0!1* Witli regard to the types of aeroplanes selected, it should be noted that this enquiry was directed in July. 1917.t Not printed, see note on p. 2.
    These conclusions were discussed by the Special Committee, and  a further  report  was asked for fr^Col. 0&apos;Gorman and Mr. Bairstow as to the effect in a 1,000-miIe journey  of  an  adverse wind on the choice of tho flight speed of an aeroplane.   This further report is appended as Appendix C.  The table attacheddthis further report sets out the available weight of crew and commercial load per 1,000 lbs. of total loadedweight, as affected by adverse and favourable winds over the journey named.    In making any  definite recommendations as to commercial transport by aeroplane the Special Commithave felt that,  for the reasons stated in the beginning of this report, it is impossible at the present stage tofuupon any particular type, and, therefore, they&apos;  present the following general  conclusions from  the technical point of view.                                 CONCLUSIONS AS  TO AEROPLANES.     (i.) That for commercial success speed is probably the most material factor.     (ii.) That for commercial success the speed needed depends very greatly  on  the conditions  of eoinpet^j          methods.   Between large centres connected by  direct high speed railways, ground  speeds of          miles per  hour are desirable; but for linking places between which the railway service is slow %         interrupted by sea crossings, lower speeds will be found commercially practicable.    (iii.)  That, at present, stages of about 500 miles would  be the normal  limit,  but that it will be desiralt          from the commercial point of view that stages should be as long as possible.    (iv.) That it is  desirable  as speedily as possible to develop the existing facilities for night flying, especi          ally for the carriage  of mails.     (v.) That heavy loading  is necessary*for commercial success, but, since this will  involve a high           speed, development of land and  air brakes is  necessary.    (vi.) That in  view of  certain disadvantages of high landing speed, efforts should be made to keep loadit;         as low as possible consistently with securing a commercial rate of speed  and to  provide for aeo         dromes and landing places possessing the best possible surfaces, and that it may well be hoped thai         future inventions and improvements in  design will enable a lower landing speed to be attained wil         out sacrifice of flying speed.                                             AIRSHIPS.    With regard to airships,  the report of  Wing Capt. Maitlaiid is appended to this Report as Appendix 1The Special Committee desire to draw special attention to the  fact that in airships above a certain size tlproportion  of available lift, i.e., crew, fuel, ballast, passengers and  merchandise,  to total  weight increaserapidly,  rising to&apos; as much as  50  per cent, in the case of a rigid airship with a gross lift of 60 tons,2,000,000 cubic feet capacity, and, therefore, from the commercial  point of  view there are obvious advantage in having airships of large size.  Further,  the conclusion can be drawn from that report that increase in siscan be readily  accompanied by increase in speed,  as the weight  of  additional engines would occupy a vei]small proportion  of  the  extra lift.   The proportion of disposable lift in the case of non-rigid airships islesat least in the case  of non-rigid airships of  the largest size at present known.  The Special Committee hatcome to the conclusion that for commercial  purposes the  rigid  type offers  certain  advantages over therigid.  In a further report  (Appendix  D) Captain  Maitland works out some  valuable statistics as to the eiof adverse wind and  ascent in a 1,000 mile  journey.                                             PRIME COST.    It is practically impossible to  give any  satisfactory estimate of running costs of  either type of aircnfrom  existing  data.   With regard to the prime  cost  of  machines,  Appendices  A  and  B contain  cunshowing the relation of gross weight to cost and useful load to cost, based on approximate war prices.-    General  figures relating to cost must be considered as indicative only; the weight of an aeroplane is ma definitely fixed quantity, and the amount of commercial load  depends on the length of journey.  An upplimit  to  the  amount of commercial load  is given in Appendices  A and  B  under  the  name of  &quot;disppable load,&quot; this term including both crew  and fuel.   A lower  limit  is obviously zero  when  the  journey is,long that the whole  of the &quot; disposable load &quot; is  absorbed by  the crew and  fuel.    Figures qualified as above are :                                       Prime cost  per lb.   Prime cost  per lb. of     Prime cost per lb. of                                       of gross weight.    disposable load.          commercial load.        .  Aeroplane (High Speed)  .........   18/-            40/-            Upwards of  40/-           Aeroplane (Low Speed)............  18/-            30/-            Upwards of  30/-           Airship (Rigid) .....................   9/-            18/-            Upwards of  18/-                                           MAIL SERVICES.    The question of the carriage of passengers or  of goods has  not yet been  considered by  the  Commit!except from  the technical point  of view of the range and weight-carrying capacity of aircraft generally, vthe Committee hope  at an early date to report further on this important branch of their subject, and on iclosely connected question of the probability of  the use of privately-owned aircraft by individuals.  In regarto wliat  follows, with respect to  air mail services it should be understood  that the Committee consider tl)in so far as the useful load-carrying capacity of the aircraft is not fully occupied by the transportation of mait should be  employed in the conveyance of passengers and even of small parcels of valuable goods.    It has been pointed out above that it is desirable from the commercial point  of view that stages should as long as possible.  This principle is  illustrated with  peculiar clearness in the case of mail services.London-Paris air  service, for example, should be effected in 2$ hours, or less, as against, say, seven noaby the land or sea route.   An air mail service would here enjoy a very evident advantage as compared fany other.  With longer Continental flights, such as that from London to Paris, and then on to Turin, great                                     * Not printed, see note on p. 2.
pavings of time should be possible us compared with existing means of communication.  In  the  case  of  theItalian  mail, the time saved might amount to as much as a day.   The longer the flight the  more important&quot;I sine time  saved, and, consequently, the better are the prospects  of  an aerial mail  service.   There  is,  forExample, nothing impossible, given the proper  facilities, in sending mails by air from London to Calcutta in  our days, as against sixteen days (minimum), or from London to Johannesburg in six days as against nineteen.e  \rhen the importance to business of  full and rapid communication, and the great cost of trans-ocean cabling  s borne in mind, it appears  perfectly  reasonable to anticipate that people will be willing  to pay a price  per  mice for letters carried  by aircraft sufficient to make these long distance air mail services commercially rvrofit-  ble. A cable message of 100 words from  London to Johannesburg to-day, at  2s.  6d. a word, costs  8 10s.,  nd  24  hours at least usually elapse between the despatch of a message from London and its delivery to  the  iddressee.   A letter  of 5,000 words need not weigh more than an ounce or two.  If such a letter could be sent  ii six days, even at 2s.  6d. an  ounce,  the saving in cost would be enormous, and the extra time taken by  his  means  of communication as compared with the cable would in many cases be more than  compensated for  iy  the  avoidance of the risk of misunderstanding inseparable  from the  use of  the  necessarily  abbreviated  anguage of cable messages.    The case is naturally different as regards air mail communications  within  Great Britain.  In the  case of services from London to large provincial towns, it may  be  said to require a flight of at least three hours, at in average, say, of 100 miles an  hour, for the speed of an air-mail service to reveal itself and for  this speed   offer a sufficiently marked saving of time over  land  transit, remembering that one must reckon the time mson in establishing the land connections of an  air service.   When an oversea journey is made, such as the] massage across  the Irish Sea in a flight to Dublin,  the saving of time offered by an air service is much more evident,  and the same  holds good in the case  of cross-country  routes, e,g.,  from  Cardiff  or   Bristol to Southampton,  where express rail services are  lacking. Attention  is  drawn  to  Appendix E, outlining a scheme for an experimental air-mail  between London  and Glasgow.  Mr. Murray, criticising this memoran- lam at the meeting of the Special Committee on October 12th,  considered that a load of 100 lbs. of mails per machine, and not 1,000 lbs., was all that  could be hoped for, at any rate, in the early stages of such a service. \&apos;o definite figures have  been arrived at, so far, as to the financial aspects of an air-mail service.  In Appendix 1, just referred to, Mr. Holt-Thomas&apos;s estimate of 4s. 8d.  a mile for overhead  charges and running  costs or an  air-mail  service between London and Paris (as outlined in his  lecture before the  Aeronautical  Society in May 30th, 1917) was adopted in the absence of other  data.   So far as a service in the United Kingdom sconcerned, assuming  the  correctness of Mr. Murray&apos;s view  that only a very  limited  volume  of express nails would be available (having regard to the excellence  of existing methods  of communication), then  it rould  become  necessary to charge some high fee, such  as  Is.  or more per letter, if there is to be any hope [fan air-mail service proving remunerative.  The Committee, however, are sanguine enough to hope that Mr. ![urray&apos;s estimate may  be somewhat too conservative, and  the matter is being considered in greater detail.    In view of the great advantages anticipated in suitable instances, the Special Committee definitely recom- mend the institution of experimental mail services without waiting for the end of the war, if this is consistent rith Naval and Military interests, but Mr. Murray desires  to record his opinion  that the out-of-pocket cost, if any, of such  experimental&apos;services, should be  borne, not  by the vote for the  G.P.O., but by that of the Department most immediately concerned, presumably the Air Ministry. .  The possibility of little-known or unexpected inventions modifying the lines of present development.   The Special Committee concur in the following conclusions drawn up by Lord Montagu, Mr. Lanchester, ind Mr.  Wells on this branch of their inquiry.   &quot; It is considered that, whilst there may be considerable  development  in the  appliances  for  flying at present known and available, namely, the aeroplane and  the airship or dirigible balloon, and in the engines fey use, these developments afford no prospect  of more than a quantitative modification of existing conditions.   &quot; So far as the aeroplane is concerned,  there is every  probability of considerable improvement.    Such lings  as an  increased use of folding wings, a device already used by  the R.N.A.S., minimising the storage itipacity required and improving braking mechanism under which  head  we may include reversible engines jind propellers, and other forms of brakes-diminishing the amount of space needed for landing, may be anti- ipated.  Beyond this, it is thought, that an all-round  improvement in  efficiency and weight-saving may be [tspected.   These improvements will probably only  slightly modify the general outline of the problem.   The ielicopter has been  considered, as well as  possible  combinations of airship and aeroplane.   The latter  alone [terns to involve the remotest possibility of affecting present practice to any serious extent.   &quot; On the question of fuel, every effort should be made  by  State  aid or State encouragement to  widen the   3 of fuel production as much as possible, and to prevent the  enormous interests  in connection with  auto- tobilism, both on land and in the air, being dependent upon fuel  of any one given kind, especially  if that belerived from  overseas or foreign  sources  of  supply.   Attention  is called to the  fact  that fuel supply forlircraft cannot be considered apart from the fuel supply  of  motor vehicles of other kinds, i.e., private  cars,fuses, lorries, etc.  Whereas on the fuel question, as in  the case of the machines themselves, there is no sign  present  of  any revolutionary development, the  fact must be  recognised that it may  at  any time becomelossible by chemical discovery to produce  volatile hydro-carbon fuels in great quantities at comparatively  small w.  While  it cannot be definitely asserted that undiscovered  methods  of  synthetic  production exist,  it isflown that in the matter of chemical discovery the possibility is  always  there, and  it is not possible to say,pen speaking of fuel, that the future can  be forecast with any degree of certainty.&quot;     *   In addition to these conclusions the  Special Committee are of opinion that the following lines of inven-jjon are of great importance to commercial  aeronautics, viz., the gyroscope and its incidental uses, the turbineptem applied to combustion engines, and directional wireless.

The Eules that will be required for aerial traffic regulation, routes,  and zones, signalling and lighting    routes and landing places, night Hying,  wireless communication,.dissemination of meteorological mim    tion, safety  appliances and prohibited areas, illustrated by one or more actual routes assumed to being    by an organised aircraft service.                                        RULES OF THE AIR.    With regard to rules  for aerial  traffic regulation, viewed from the point of view of domestic control,!Special  Committee  approve of the existing code of rules drawn up by the Royal Aero Club.  These rules jappended as Appendix F. to this report.  These rules are aimed mainly  at preventing collisions in the aiiyisome  additions will be necessary  to  deal with problems arising  from the  ascent from and descent to atijdromes.  The Special Committee  will report further on such additions  when they have had  the opportuiof considering certain military and naval regulations to be applied in the  case of existing aerodromes.  ^regard to traffic  regulations from  the international point of view, the  Special Committee are  proposing\report to  Special Committee  No. .1, particularly  as to certain proposed  regulations contained in  the 3rdAnnex to the Draft  Convention of Paris of 1910,&apos;which will require revision in  the light of the recent develop.ments of aeronautics generally.    The Special Committee do not  at present make any recommendation as to different altitudinal zonesji]different types of aircraft,  although  they recognise that in the future  some regulation on this  subject tbecome necessary.                                    AIR ROUTES GENERALLY.    in  considering the planning  and definition of particular air routes, certain general  considerations aigiIn the case of a  commercial aerial service the route will generally begin or end at some large town or centrlof population; but its course may  vary in accordance with  the  needs  of intermediate  towns in a populatf!country and in accordance  with the factors of prevailing  winds and landing facilities in the case either/long journeys over undeveloped countries or  of long journeys over the  sea,    In the two latter instances the necessity  for a planned and defined route is  sufficiently obvious, for in itcase of a flight over, e.g., Africa, the provision of landing facilities on  a liberal scale is impracticable, aniithe case of a flight  from America to Europe  prevailing winds  will play a. large part in,  fixing  outward 4homeward  tracks.  In the  United Kingdom,  or  at any rate in  England, present and future  military reqoiments will involve the creation of a  large number of landing grounds, but where mails have  to  be delivertlthe provision of  definitely marked routes  is  necessary  for the  sake of economy, speed, reliability, and  said]of navigation.                                LANDING GROUNDS ON AIR ROUTES.    As to the provision of  alighting grounds, the Special  Committee have not felt  justified in committitlthemselves to a  definite recommendation that landing places  are required  at  fixed  distances  along  aeroutes.  What it is thought will  happen, in  the ordinary course of development, will be  for main aerodroto be established in the neighbourhood of the large centres of population,  and then for these main aerodroto be connected  by  the institution of subsidiary aerodromes near smaller  centres of  population; while purlemergency landing  grounds along the various routes  will be placed, not so much with the idea of their beingifregular intervals&apos;, but rather with a view to providing safe alighting  points  in localities where the nature(jthe country might  render dangerous an involuntary descent.    To illustrate the problems which may arise  as to aerial routes, the  Committee desire to draw attentionl]certain  conclusions which  may be drawn from reports obtained  from   their members as to  certain specil]routes arbitrarily chosen.   These  reports were submitted to the Committee by the following members         (a) London Edinburgh Glasgow Dublin London.   (Major-General Ruck.)         (b)  London to the Riviera.                             (Mr.  Holt Thomas.)         (c) London to South Africa                           (Lord Montagu.)         (d)  The Atlantic  Route.        *                      (Commander  Porte.)         (e) London Norway Sweden-Russia.               (Major-General Ruck.)    In drawing  up these reports  it has  not been possible to work out in detail  the precise provision that wlbe required on each  for signalling and lighting and for other  matters mentioned in heading  III. (quotaabove) of the  terms of reference to the Special Committee.  Decisions  as  to what is required  in these respecijon particular routes can only be arrived at  by actual experiment, and the Special Committee have therefi)confined themselves to such general propositions as can be affirmed with some measure  of confidence  in I&apos;light  of existing knowledge.                   LONDON-EDINBURGH-GLASGOW-DUBLIN-LONDON.     As to (a) it appears that, so  far as the existence of  landing grounds is concerned,   the most  attract!route northward at the present time would  follow the line of the Great Northern and  North-Eastern fways, via Berwick.   In so far  as the route to Edinburgh is viewed in  the light of direct  transit, regardlesintermediate stops,  this line offers the  greatest advantages on the score  of time-saving;  but when the posbilities are considered of linking up important  centres of population,  a route to the  westward covering, e.fBedford.  Northampton, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield, and Leeds may be preferable.  As against this roiit should be  mentioned that in some conditions of weather pilots prefer  to proceed  along the coast as farpossible.   The creation in the future of further landing facilities may considerably modify  conclusions asthe best route to Edinburgh from the commercial point  of view,  and the possibility of planning a  roigenerally to  the  westward of the East  Coast line must not be lost sight of.     The route from Edinburgh to Dublin might pass Glasgow and Belfast, via Kilmarnock, Ayr, StranraeBelfast, Portadown, Dundalk, and Drogheda,  On this section the route  is more or  less  undeveloped as far&apos;landing grounds are concerned.     From Dublin to London the route  might follow the track of the mail steamers to Holyhead,  and theithe line of the present London and  North-Western Railway, via Chester  and Crewe, assuming it to be a,pof what would  ultimately become  a&apos; West  Coast route to  Scotland,  via Manchester   and Liverpool. present there are objections to  a West  Coast  route  to Scotland, owing to the  mountainous  nature  oftcountry north of Carlisle and the absence of landing  grounds. In fact, the most direct line from North )M
 Tjondon would turn  off near St. Asaphand go straight  to  Birmingham,   handing  facilities&apos; from  the[jljtary point of  view  already  exist  on this  route from  Torn Hill, near Market Drayton,  through  Birming-  i, Coventry, Rugby, and Aylesbury.                                  LONDON  TO THE RIVIERA.   As to (b), the route from  London  to the Riviera, this does not  call for much comment, except that  itIjll probably follow the line of Paris, Dijon, Lyons, aud Marseilles, showing  a saving of time from LondonLMarseilles of something like  seventeen hours.   An alternative route would be to fly from  Avignon direct  to[alines, leaving  Marseilles and Toulon on the right, thus effecting a considerable saving in distance.                                 LONDON TO SOUTH  AFRICA.   As to (c) the routes from London to South Africa, Lord  Montagu furnished  particulars of an  Eastern   3, via Marseilles, Naples, Crete,  Egypt,  and the Valley of the Nile, and Northern Rhodesia, and a Western lie, via Bordeaux, Gibraltar, and the Sahara, Lagos, Angola, and Rhodesia.   The total  distance of the astern route is some  7,800 miles, and the  Western route some 7,210  miles.   On  a theoretical basis of a ieed of 80 miles per. hour and continuous flying for twenty-four hours per day, the time taken by  the Eastern ,u(e would be 4 days  1J hours, and by the  Western route 3  days 18 hours.  Lord  Montagu pointed  out in his jort  that  meteorological  conditions,  generally speaking,  favoured  the  use  of  the Eastern  route  from the piled Kingdom to South Africa and the use of the Western  route on the return  journey from South Africa     United Kingdom.   Whichever route may  in the future be found to be the better, or whether it may be mind desirable to operate  both, the Committee can at this stage only recommend that a practical experiment liiiild be instituted on either or both routes  at as early a date as possible. The Eastern route would appear  lie commercially the more important,  and would pass  mainly over British  territory.   &quot;It  would be easy  to aggerate  the importance of  this latter consideration in connection with future commercial aerial traffic aierally, but for the purposes of conducting  an experiment there are obvious advantages  in  having  to deal Hi territory under the  jurisdiction  of His Majesty rather than with foreign territory.                                   THE ATLANTIC ROUTE.   As to (d), the Atlantic  route,  Commander Porte pointed  out in his  report that for some time to  come a rect route  from Ireland to  Newfoundland and vice versa  will be found impracticable.   He suggested that the   possible solution of  the Trans-Atlantic  route at the present time and for many years  to come, would be  use the so-called &quot;Azores&quot; route, employing San Miguel, the principal island of the Azores,  as a landing ion.  To avoid the great distance of a direct flight from the United Kingdom to San Miguel, he recom- Bided a route from  London  via Paris,  Madrid, and Lisbon,  the distance from  Lisbon  to  San  Miguel sing 775 miles.  From San  Miguel to Newfoundland is 1,346. miles, although this distance could;be reduced  1,015 miles by calling at Flores, another of the Azores group.  The use  of Newfoundland  as a terminus  sents great difficulty owing to  continual  fog on the banks&quot;and around Newfoundland itself.* The effect of  is fog is to. make a journey westward to Newfoundland liable to the  danger  and uncertainty  involved  in  lying to come down to.land through the fog.  The same difficulty does not occur in the  eastward journey   i Newfoundland, in that the pilot can lay  his course by the compass and would within a comparatively short   )d find himself outside the fog area.   Commander Porte&apos;s  conclusion is  that,  at  any rate in the immediate future, it would be  preferable  to fix   l New York as the Western terminus of  the  Atlantic route.   The distance  from  San  Miguel  to  Long  [and is roughly 2,250 nautical miles, and Commander  Porte suggests  that  for the purpose of dividing this   ; distance into&apos;reasonable stages, it would be  necessary to design and arrange for &quot; Sea Stations,&quot; in the   pe of long ships of, say, 600 ft., with a clear upper deck of 400 ft., fitted with wireless and the-necessary  tailing apparatus.   Such an arrangement would  make possible the use of aeroplanes rather than seaplanes.   While  Commander Porte is a high authority, the Special Committee do not feel  that  they possess suffi-   nt independent information to enable them to express a confident opinion with regard to his conclusions.   So   as these are based upon  the prevalence of fog on the Newfoundland coast,  Major Taylor is disposed to think   1 they are open to question.  Major Taylor&apos;s impression, based upon his study of the subject, is that the sea   I prevailing off the  Newfoundland coast are low in altitude  and do not extend far inland.   Any further   fence that could be obtained on this point would be valuable.*   Here,  again, the  Committee  can only  recommend  that a  practical  experiment  should  be instituted  as  \ as  may be possible, all available information as to the weather conditions likely  to be encountered that  f be in the possession of the Meteorological  Office or of the Governments of the II.S.A.,  Canada, and New-  udland having first  been  studied with a view to undertaking the experiment with the best  chances of success.   This route would  appear to be a particularly suitable one for an experiment with airships as well as with   planes,  the  distance  in a direct  line from the East Coast of Newfoundland  to the West Coast  of Ireland   % no more than could be accomplished in favourable weather by airships already in existence.iratfarheri piifWa                                    LONDON TO RUSSIA. As to  (e), the route from the United Kingdom  to Russia, via  Norway and Sweden, it was suggested to Committee that  a service might be  conducted from  London  to  Yarmouth by  aeroplane,  a distance,roximately, of 100 miles; by seaplane from Yarmouth to Christianssand, a distance of  approximately  450bs; by  seaplane from  Christianssand to Stockholm, crossing  the Swedish lakes, a distance of approxi-lely 360 miles; and, as a final stage, from  Stockholm  to Petrograd by seaplane,  a  distance  of approxi-ely 450 miles, crossing the Baltic and continuing up the Gulf of Finland.  The  total  distance would be*it 1,360 miles.  The progressive reliability of  aeroplanes will probably, within a short  period, render  the of seaplanes unnecessary.  this route, also, might afford a favourable opportunity for the use of airships.*See the heading &quot; Aerial Routes &quot; in the final report of this Special Committee and Appendix B to that report.
                                MARKING OP  AERIAL ROUTES.    As to the marking of aerial routes, several recommendations have been made.    Wing Captain Groves  has suggested that all main  routes should be marked at intervals of five miles bstrip, 200  feet  in  length  and 16  feet  in breadth  (formed of chalk or  small stones treated with so;white mixture), each mark pointing exactly along the line of route.   He  recommends, also, that alongsjjeach mark should be an alphabetical letter, 50  feet in  length, to indicate the routes to which  they belong&quot;while, in addition to these letters, each mark should have  its distinguishing  number,  in  figures 1G feet hisIn clear weather these figures would not be required by the pilot, but  in thick weather, rain, or  other adveconditions, they would  help him to discover his exact  whereabouts.    Lieut.-Col. 0&apos;Gorman,  after considering the memorandum by Captain Groves, suggested that main raihjjroutes should be identified  by various combinations of dots and dashes formed by lines  of chalky stones, bithe representative of the Board of Trade expressed the view that there  would be serious  difficulties in \\practical working of this proposal.    Generally speaking, and  in the light of the information before the Special Committee, it  would appethat in  anything like favourable weather, a pilot  has  no difficulty in finding his way  from point to  nojijcorrecting his compass course by visual observations of prominent  landmarks,  and  by following  railwajwhen they are on his line of flight.  This applies particularly to  the  aviator who  flies  frequently over angiven route, as, for example, in the case of the &quot; ferry  &quot; pilots who  take new machines by air  from Londoto G.H.Q. in France, or to  Montrose in  Scotland.  These pilots find it so easy to steer an accurate course!compass and visual observations of  landmarks and railways that they  have, apparently, never even considerthe need for artificial markings.    When clouds are low, however, and an aviator may have to fly as low,  perhaps,  as a few hundred  feet&apos;order to correct his compass course by an observation of the ground, it is considered  that  artificial markinwould be extremely useful;  and one  suggestion which has  been made,  and which meets  with the  approvalthe Special Committee, is that the roofs of railway  stations  or sheds should  have their  names  painted irthem in letters large enough to be distinguished by the pilot of an aircraft.  It would be of great advanti,that these letters should be brightly illuminated at night.    The Special Committee recognise that while it may meet the case for a military aviator to find his is from one  landmark  to another, or to follow some convenient railway, even should this take him a little frhis course, a commercial pilot,  carrying mails,  say, from London to  Paris, will find any deviation fromtdirect line reflecting itself - adversely not only in his time-table,  but also in the matter  of  fuel  consumptrIt may be thought necessary, therefore, by  those who operate such commercial services,  to lay  down sovery  clear system of landmarks, so as to ensure an absolute adherence by  their pilots to a given line of fligThe placing  of  such marks on private  ground will, of course,  be a  matter of arrangement between lanowners  and aircraft companies; though it would  appear advisable that there should be supervision  bytauthorities to prevent any possible  confusion arising through the use by various companies of different schemof marking.                                        NIGHT  FLYING.    As to night flying, at any rate on a commercial scale,  it is  recognised  that  some special  methodilluminating  aerodromes and  intermediate points,  so as to enable pilots to land and also to afford them a meaof checking their compass course, and to help them in combating the difficulties of ground mists  and fogs,wneed  to be adopted; but this question has not yet been considered in detail.                               METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION    The dissemination of meteorological information  has obviously a very important  bearing on the develoment of civil aerial transport, particularly from the point of view  of the safety and  punctuality of serviwhich will require to run to time-tables.  Much meteorological knowledge  has, of course, been accumulatfor many years by the Meteorological Office, but, as such knowledge has hitherto been required almost whotfor the purpose of persons moving over the surface of land and sea, the study of the meteorology of the upair, which  is alPimportant for the purpose of aeronautics,  is in a less  advanced condition.  The first ste,must be in the direction of collecting the required body of  knowledge and arranging for the tabulation of tdata,  as they vary from hour to hour.  This involves at the outset much  scientific  study and research,branch of our subject which falls  primarily within the scope  of  Special  Committee  No. 5, by whom, hoever, we have been  supplied with two valuable papers by Major Lyons and  Sir  Napier Shaw,  which  aattached as Appendices to the interim report of that Special Committee.    Assuming measures to have been taken for the collection of the necessary scientific knowledge, it remaito consider measures for making it  readily and easily accessible  to  the pilots  and others  concerned for  tpurposes of practical flying.   Many useful suggestions in  regard  to this matter  are  contained in Sir NaShaw&apos;s paper, and the subject has also been dealt with by  a Sub-Committee of Special Committee No. 2, cosisting of Lord Montagu and Major Taylor.  Their report, with  the  conclusions  of  which  we  agree,appended (Appendix G).   We particularly desire  to emphasise  the importance of the establishment at eamain or  &quot; terminal &quot; aerodrome of  what Sir Napier  Shaw has described as a  &quot;  Map room,&quot; in charge of person capable of explaining rapidly and intelligently to practical pilots the meteorological conditions likeat the moment to be met with in the vicinity.  Such establishments, if they are to  be efficient, presupp&quot;the frequent direct communication to them by pilots of information  as  to the conditions actually experiencby them in their  flights.   The importance of making s ich communications  should  be impressed upon pi&apos;0
  d commercial machines  should  be fitted for this as well  as  for  other  purposes  with wireless telegraphic  nparatus.  It will anpear  from a  report by Colonel 0&apos;Gorman and Major Vincent  Smith (Appendix H) that  ^requirement should  eventually present no serious difficulty, since it is to be expected that a large com-  eicial machine would not be navigated by one pilot working single-handed, but that the pilot would ordinarily  accompanied by at least one assistant who would be able to send the requisite wireless messages without  ifficulty.   The Committee have  ascertained  from the Admiralty  that there exists  a  complete  system  of Naval  [eteorological Stations in  the United Kingdom in direct   communication  with the  Admiralty  Office   in  ndon.  These stations are run  at a small cost, a staff consisting of an officer  and three men being sufficient  prday and night duty.  At most of these stations weather maps can be prepared.  Although these stations  live not been  established solely for aeronautical purposes the Committee think that their assistance  may well  (invoked in connection with a scheme for disseminating meteorological  information,  and  at least  they  can  jrve as models for stations to be established in connection  with terminal aerodromes. &apos;                                      PROHIBITED AREAS   With regard to the  question  of prohibited areas, the  Special  Committee are  not yet in  a  position to  submit a report.                                      SAFETY APPLIANCES   The Committee have taken into consideration the use of safety appliances in commercial aircraft.  These  (ill no doubt be largely  developed by experiment  after the  conclusion of  the war,  and the  Committee would  draw special attention to the different lines of enquiry with regard  to safety appliances suggested in a report  If Captain  Maitland and  Colonel 0&apos;Gorman (Appendix I), with which the Committee concur.   IV.  The  estimated number,  size, and location of landing  grounds  suitable  for  an  organised aircraft service, with the technical requirements of management staff and  maintenance and  the estimated running tost of such  grounds.                              LANDING GROUNDS GENERALLY   As stated  earlier  in this  report, the Special  Committee do not advise the provision of landing grounds at ised distances on aerial  routes, although they hold the view that in  the  case of main  routes the safety  and regularity of commercial services  will  largely depend on the  existence of a sufficient  number  of  alighting pints lying along the line of route.   Generally  speaking,  the positions selected for aerodromes or landing  grounds,  should  comply  with  the lowing conditions       (1) bear some reference to the direction of the main aerial routes;       (2) be sufficiently far,from the centres of cities to be fairly clear of houses in the direction  of flight;       (3) be unlikely  to be shut in by buildings in the immediate future;       (4) be as far as  possible clear  of railways, telegraphs, trees, and  other  obstructions;       (5) be situated  on ground as far as possible free from  mist and fogs;       (6) be provided with adequate water supply, telephone connections and good facilities for rail, tram,           &apos;bus and  motor traffic with the different districts of the cities to be visited ;       (7) be capable of  expansion.                  AERODROMES  AND  INTERMEDIATE LANDING PLACES   With regard to aerodromes, the Committee has obtained a report  from  Colonel  0&apos;Gorman, Mr. Holt- lomas and Mr. Lanchester, and with regard to  intermediate  landing places a report from Captain  E. Elvey Sobb.  These  reports are attached as Appendices  J and K.  The Committee  agree with these reports gener-(%, and consider them valuable as indicating the possible requirements of the future,  when there  has beenjtime  for civil aerial transport  to develop itself on  a considerable scale.  As things stand at present,  however, it must be borne in mind that the exigencies of the war have already led to the establishment in all parts of le country of aerodromes and landing places with an equipment fully sufficient to deal  with  any civil air traffic to be expected in  the earlier days of peace.   The  reports should not therefore be read as indicating that  it will  be necessary in the near future to set  up new and elaborate organisations with consequent heavy Rpenditure for the purposes of civil air traffic alone.  Generally  speaking,  the Committee hold the  view that, subject  to necessary  military  regulations,  it is iesirable to arrange for  the user by civil aircraft of as many as possible of the intermediate landing grounds, which are at present or will in the future be under military control.  V.  The estimated  cost of maintaining  an aerial service, including aerodromes,  sheds, landing grounds,labour, wages, running  expenses, depreciation and. repairs, exclusive of  capital charge for  the  purchase of machines on the assumption of a route of definite length and the employment of a definite number of aircraftftereon.  VI.  To advise in the  light of the answers to the foregoing questions as to  the main aerial routes whichlight be marked out and  prepared for now for utilisation by an aircraft service.
    On these two branches of their enquiry the Special Committee  are not yet in  a position to submitreport, although certain matters which fall within paragraph VI. have already been touched upon in that]of this report which deals with certain specified air routes.

Malcolm,        Secretary.December 19th. 1917.    * Mr. Holt-Thomas signs the report with the reservation  that the adoption of a  scheme of landilgrounds on all main routes is, in his opinion, essential  to  the  success of  civil  aerial  transport as regarjregularity  of service,  rapid conveyance by reserve machines in case of break-down, and the effect on (and efficiency of machines.  The landing ground  scheme, in his opinion, should be adopted, and he sees!it the probable solution of many difficulties as regards flying in fog and by night, etc.  He also puts forwithe argument that the expense of any such scheme has already  proved to be almost negligible compared wilthe cost of any service, and that therefore, taking into account the  undisputed advantage  offered, he[unwilling that this report should go out without expression  of opinion  on his part that the landing grailscheme  on all main routes should certainly be recommended and adopted.   On this  point he is bound]totally disagree with  the report, as he considers that in the absence  of a landing  ground scheme irregllarities in  aerial services may occur which may have a very dangerous effect on the future of aerial navigatjjin  the opinion  of the Public.                                   &apos;SPECIAL COMMITTEE  No. 2.-INTERIM  REPORT.

      49APPENDIX  E.91Memorandum  by  the  Assistant Secretary (Technical) on  the  establishment of an experi-mental  air-mail  service,  one  machine  being run  each  way  daily,  weather permitting,                between  London and Glasgow,  via  Newcastle  and  Edinburgh.  It is assumed that, in an experimental service, started im-inediately after the war, only a limited quantity of expressmails would be carried,  at a fee determined by the Post Office,and  that the bulk of the mails will still go,  as at present, byland. A  London-Glasgow route has been  chosen for illustrationfor several reasons.  In the first  place, it requires at least athree hours&apos; flight, at an average,  say, of 100 miles an hour,such  as that from London to  Newcastle, for the speed of  an air service  to reveal  itself  and for this  speed  to offer  amfficientlv marked  saving of  time  over   railway  transit,remembering that one must reckon the  time taken in estab-lishing  the  land  connections  of an air service. In  regard to cities which are, say, a four hours&apos; journeyby rail  from London, such  as Manchester,  it is possible to&quot;express &quot; a letter  in  London  at  a reasonable hour  in the morning, and  for  this letter which goes by a  fast train to each its  destination well before the  close of the businessJay.  An express air service on such a route, therefore,  evenit it  could cut down the time by an hour or so,  as comparedirith  the transit by train, would  only  be offering a businessnan  a  slightly additional convenience.&apos;  He  might,  indeed,ay that so long as his &quot; express &quot; letter reached its destina-lon in time to be dealt  with before the office to which it wasiddressed  closed for the day  that  he was satisfied, and wasindifferent whether the letter  was delivered, say, at 2.30  p.m.or 3.30  p.m.   But in the  case  of  a city like  Newcastle,  ortities farther North, it  is not possible  to &quot; express &quot; letters2.15 to 3.13. The aeroplane continues its  flight to Edin-    burgh.  It does not stop at Edinburgh,  the mail-bag    for that city being  dropped into a net, and the letters    delivered  by four o&apos;clock.3.15 to 3.45.

The London  mail  is carried from  Hendon                                                                  into  the city  and distributed.                                                            It may be useful  to give  an illustration  of  the  facilities                                                          offered by such an air-mail service as that described :                                                             The  Newcastle recipient  of  a  letter,  say, from  London,                                                          after acquainting himself with its contents, might be  able, inB tho1 morning Tn Londonfat any&quot; hour &quot;which&quot; might be&quot; con-  some  cases to answer immediately by telegram  or telephone,toed reasonable for business purposes, and for these letters  or   might prefer  to write a more detailed answer which  each such cities  by train in time to be dealt  with before  would go back  to London in the ordinary way by  eveninglb close of the business day.  Therefore,  by instituting a        being received  in  London the next morning.   If  the[ondon-Newcastle-Edinburgh-Glasgow  service,  and  by  so  recipient of the letter  adopted the ast-mentioned course,  thoranging this service that a business man could post  a letter  air-mail being used only one  way,  there would stillbe a cleari the morning in London or Glasgow, and for this letter  to  s&apos;lvinS 111 tin?e of a day, as compared with the existing routineliach its destination before the close of the business day, onetimid offer  the business world  a very clear facility, which not  be offered by any existing means of transit. The  use  is  assumed  of  an,  aeroplane  which,  carrying1,000 lbs. of  mails, will maintain an average speed of 100 milesii hour. It is very  necessary to consider the time occupied in estab-shing  the land  communications of  an air service.  Letterslust be  carried  from the city to the aerodrome, and  then,  the  other end, from the aerodrome to the city.  In theleriod immediately following the war, Hendon will, it mav        id,  be  the  London  terminal  aerodrome  for mailervices.   It is assumed, also,  that mails  will  be  carriedptween the  G.P.O. and the aerodrome in motor vans.  In aear or eighteen months after the war the Post Office will it hoped, have  in operation a miniature electric undergroundairway, carrying mails  from East to  West  of London, andice versa, at  a  maximum speed  of 35  miles  an hour.   Anintension of  this railway from Mount Pleasant to the Hendonlerodrome would enable mails to be carried from the G.P&apos;.0. Hendon in about a quarter of an hour. In  the provisional  time  table which  is submitted for aon don-Glasgow service, three-quarters-of-an-hour has beenflowed for each land connection and distribution of letters, made by motor vans or motor cycles.PROVISIONAL TIME  TABLE: London-Glasgow,  Glasgow-                       London.

Carriage of the mails by air from Hendon      to Newcastle.   The distance in  a straight line  is      about 250 miles; but an allowance  is made for slight      deviations on the part of the pilot, while a  three      hours&apos; flight has been  assumed for the  convenience      of obtaining  a   round  figure.   In actual working,      however,  taking the average  speed  throughout  at      100  miles  an hour, the journey  should be accom-      plished  in a little  less  than three hours.  But, as      against this, may be set such small losses of time, in      the  actual operation of  a service,  as cannot be cal-      culated in advance.  The aeroplane  does not alight      at Newcastle, but drops  the Newcastle mail in  a net,      and  continues its flight.   The Newcastle mail is then      carried  into  the city,  and may be assumed to have      been  distributed by 3  o&apos;clock.  It might be found      necessary  in  actual working  to descend at Newcastle      to pick up  letters which Newcastle firms desired&apos; to      &amp;end by air to Glasgow.   . of correspondence this routine being for a letter to be posted in  the  evening in London, received  in  Newcastle the next morning, the answer being written and posted that day,  reach- ing London on the third morning. -   By courtesy of  the  Post  Office, it is possible to  state that at  the  present time, reckoning the  mails  dispatched  both ways, a total of approximately 260,000 letters  and postcards are carried during a period of 24 hours between London, Newcastle, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. Could it be assumed that each  individual  posting represented  a  letter  weighing  an ounce, then it would be possible to state that, if approximately an  eighth of  this existing volume of mail traffic could  be transferred to the air,  there would  be sufficient  to fill one machine each  way a day -reckoning  each machine to carry a  1,000  lbs. load.  But it is  the  custom of the Post  Office to place letters and postcards under one heading, and separate figures  are not obtainable.   As to the financial aspect of the London-Glasgow air service, adopting Mr.  Holt Thomas&apos;s figure of 4s.  8d. per mile  for overhead charges and running costst. the daily  expenses of a contractor, operating one nlachine each way, would  be roughlv . 198.  As  against  this,  at  a full load both  ways fa total of 32,000 ounces), the contractor^ charge for carriage, to cover his bare expenses, would be almost exactly l d. per ounce. Assuming an  express service, with a charge to the public of 4d. or 6d. per ounce, for a fair proportion  of  letters drawn from the total of 260,000 letters and postcards which has heen mentioned  in  the paragraph above,  it would  appear that, on  a contract of carriage the Post Office could well pay  the contractor a sum which would not only cover his bare expenses,. but show a considerable profit  in working.                                          HARRY  HARPER.   10th September,  1917.    * Newcastle firms wishing to  send a letter by air  to London  would be able to post up to as late as 12.10 p.m.  This  would  allow firms in cities near  by, such  as Gateshead, Sunderland and  South  Shields,  to catch the air mail for London  by  sending  in  their letters to Newcastle bv train: or an aeroplane might visit  these neighbouring districts during the morning, collecting letters  for London, which it would bririg to the Newcastle aerodrome  in  time to catch  the London machine.  Such a system feeding the  main route might be adopted also in  other localities.    t This estimate of 4s. 8d. per mile is worked out by Mr. Holt  Thomas in his  paper  read before  the Aeronautical  Society  of  Great  Britain on Mav 30, 1917, relating  to an   aerial service  between London and paris.  The figure of .4s. 8d. is based on the  assumption of  a service by one machine each way dailv, and it is  thought that a fair analogy  can be drawn between the London-  Paris service  and  that outlined  in the present  memorandum.  Without in anv way  criticising  Mr. Holt  Thomas&apos;s  figures,  it  would appear that they rest on what may be called a conservative  basis, and  that, therefore, the expenses in the present instance  are not estimated at too low a figure.MM.:-&apos;  I                    &quot;                        E

The chief meteorological requirements for the guidance of aerial  Transport may be divided1 into three groups :     (1) Statistical information.    (2) Forecasts.       ,    (3)&apos; Knowledge of the  momentary meteorological condi-        tions along aerial  routes.(1)  Statistical information.  Most  of  the  meteorological  information  at  present Inexistence is in the hands of the1 Meteorological Office or canbe obtained by them.  Statistical information would be useful for such purposes has choosing routes and  the sites for aerodromes and  build-ings.   The statistical  information  at present   obtainabledifferentiates between areas of  50 or 100 miles square; forinstance,  between  the  meteorological conditions  which are met with on opposite sides of a mountain chain.  But thereis as yet little information  relating to the  local variations in meteorological conditions.  Statistics already collected are available for determiningsuch questions ad whether it is better to leave Switzerlandon the port or starboard hand iri  flying to Italy, or whetherit would pay to go round southwards by the  Azores&apos; in flyingto America. On the other hand,  the statistical information at present&apos;availably is not  capable of discriminating betweenthe average meteorological conditions of two  alternativesites,for aerodromes situated within a few miles, or even 20or 30 miles, of one another, except in sofar as it&apos;shows which of the meteorological conditions are likely to be the same intwo neighbouring sites.  Statistics  show,, for instance,  thatthe cloudiness and rainfall  in  two neighbouring sites  maybe the same unless  special, circumstances interfere.  On theother hand, fogginess  and windiness  depend  almost exclu-sively  on  such  local conditions that  the present statisticsare, of little use except  for  the actual station at whichobservations were made.   Perhaps,  later,  aerodromes willaccumulate their own data.   A small staff at the Meteorological  Office would collect theavailable useful information, but such a staff  would  haveto be  directed  by  someone in touch with aeronautics, inorder  that the information might be collected and tabulated in the form most useful for flying.  He would have to decidesUch questions as whether frequencies or mean values should be dealt&apos;with.   In dealing with wind&apos;statistics, for instance, it is more useful to know the number of hours, during which certain  winds  blow with certain strengths,  and from the various directions, than it is to know the mean wind velocity or direction. -  If weather stations are going to be established&apos;at terminiand intermediate aerodromes in connection with  civil aeriitransport, it will be necessary to overhaul  thoroughly tilcharacter of  observations taken, in order that special atteition may be paid&apos; to the data which are most important.  It is advisable that a system should be organised by whicobservations are taken and  recorded regularly by aeroplamtravelling  on defined routes.  The work of collecting atcomparing  these statistics,  and  the  superintendence (instruments  might  be  Undertaken by the MeteorologiciOffice.  It has been pointed out by various1 members of  the Coijmittee that  civil aerial transport will inevitably have t(be worked on international lines.  It is impossible to foncast  what  measure  of  international co-operation willpossible  after the war, but it may be pointed out that f(many years  previous to the war the International Meteonlogical  Committee has  done  successful  work in organisinjinternational exchange  of  meteorological information aninternational co-operation  in meteorological research.   Iseems certain that it would be advisable to consult with tliaerial transport&apos; authorities  in  the allied  countries before&apos;deciding on any definite  plans foiva weather  service foaerial transport.(2) Forecasting.   An extension  of the  present system in operation  at ttMeteorological Office should provide everything that can&apos; bexpected in the present state of  our  meteorological knoii]ledge&apos;.   The high average  correctness of weather forecastwill doubtless be improved.   Present si/stem.-The present system involves&apos;taking obseivations  at certain places two or three times a day, and coinmunicating  by  telegraph with a Central Office,  where th weather maps are made and the forecasts issued.  Forecast for  12 or 24 hours ahead at two or three fixed hours shout1 be telegraphed from- the Central Office to the termini m intermediate aerodromes. Directions in -whioli present system could be extended   1. Extension  of range  covered.-Weather telegrams ar already obtained from a few  distant places,  as Iceland Cairo,  and  the Azores, and from ships by wireless,   v number of distant stations could be increased and the rang extended so as  to include Russia, the Balkans, North Afr&apos;c and America.  Before the&apos; war the observations sent by^ ffirj less from ships usually arrived too late  to be  used in W forecasts, but the growing importance of messages; from t Atlantic in connection witli  aerial transport  will make
   th whilo to organise theso  reports in such a way that   messages arrive  in  timo.   For this  purpose fuller  coi   ration with the Royal&apos; Navy  and tho Mercantile Marino  ,uld bo sought.   ly increasing  in this way the number of data on which  ccasts are based,  it will ho  possible to increase tho size   e region for  which the forecast is issued and to make it  je accurate in all ways.                                /   Extension  in the number  of  weather  conditions pre-  ted. At present tho  forecasts are adapted to the needs  people on the ground  or the sea sailors,  farmers, travel-  j, etc. They might be much more useful to flying men iff( y were made to include the  heights  at which clouds are  &apos;je expected, and tho velocity and direction of the upper  ds.   The first of these has not yet been attempted, but  the data furnished by aeroplanes become more numerous  i forecasts may become accurate  and  useful.  The second,   forecasting of wind at various heights, has already been  jtised successfully in&apos; France  by  the  Meteorological  tion  there, and there is no reason why it should not  be   ied  out  even  more successfully  over a wider range  by   Meteorological Office.                   i  tuch  forecasts  would  be facilitated  by  increasing the  ilber of upper air observations and of  those on mountains.  Knowledge of the  momentary weather.  &apos;or this purpose the present system is  quite inadequate  continuous weather service   would   be necessary.   All  :ding grounds would evidently be suitable weather  obser-  ion stations, and continuous  readings and reports could  arranged for, if necessary.  in distributing information two  systems could be used.   er the observations could be communicated at frequent  lervals, say, every  hour, to- a. Central  Office, and  could  &amp; be  telegraphed or telephoned  when  required to aero-  imes,   or  the  observations  could be taken  only  when  uired and telephoned direct to the termini.  he advantage  of the Central Office is that it would have  jore  comprehensive view  of the  weather  conditions over  whole of Europe,  and,  moreover,  an expert could  be  - at the Central Office who would have the present condi-  is at  his fingers&apos; ends, and would know which were liable  i sudden change.  he chief  difficulty  which is likely  to be  experienced  in   branch of the weather service is that of communicating the observations sufficiently quickly ,to the termini.  It seems probable that the direct method would be quicker than the Central Office  method.  Another point in favour of direct communication is that tho observations taken at an inter- mediate landing-ground are only immediately interesting to the termini of tho route on which it lies.  Theso  two points appear to  us to  outweigh the  advantages of tho Centra] Office method.   If  there is a &quot;direct telephone wire along tho route&apos; or( constant  wireless communication, tlie  whole problem is&apos; greatly simplified.  On the other hand, if the ordinary tele- phone lines have to bo used, some sort of priority lor weather messages will have to be arranged&apos; if they are to be of  any real use. &apos;  Tho  type of observations which could usefully be taken at the intermediate landing grounds needs some consideration. The height of the clouds is one of the most important tilings&apos; for a pilot to know.  It would not be difficult to fit a range- finder which would give the height of the clouds at a glance.   Tho  velocity and direction of the wind at various heights5 is also important,  but it needs ia  skilled observer  to make a1 pilot-balloon ascent,  &apos;and even then the information is  not available  for  about three-quarters  of an hour  after  the balloon1 is  sent off.  It seems hardly possible to  use pilot- balloons in connection  with this branch  of the weatherservice,  unless balloons, are sent  up at regular intervals of two or three hours,, and  the last result is communicated in&apos; response to any enquiry from a terminus.  On the other hand, on la clear  day  the upper wind at any particular height would be found in a few seconds by means of a smoke-shell fired vertically and timed) so as to explode at the  right height.; One of the chief functions of the observer at the landing- grounds would be to report the appearance and disappear- ance of fog on  their own aerodrome.  This  needs no very special training, but trained and experienced observers willbe needed  at every  important aerodrome  where  upper-air work is carried out, and lalso at places from  which  local or general forecasts  are issued.   A corps  of  such  observersshould  form an  integral part of the military  or civil  air services, as, dn fact, they already form a part of the royal naval Air Service.

APPENDIX  I.                            Safety Appliances for  Commercial  Aircraft.  1,  The risk of  forced landing of aeroplanes is  the  first of  the aeroplane  will bo fouled when tho jump is taken.  More-all risks run, and for this  two remedial possibilities exist,  over,  a substantial proportion of the accidents which occurThe most important expenditure on safety and on the general  only become accidents after the ground has been reached, oreconomy of  aerial transport is the  provision of  alighting  too nearly approached for the parachute to bo useful.  Thogrounds along the  flying  routes, and  no  suggestion herein is  best position for a parachute would  seem to bo either on thoput  forward in  substitution for,  or in  diminution  of, tho  underside or on tho  side of the body, and  a comparativelyimportance of these route-alighting grounds; the second is the  flat and compact parachute case  has already been designedextension of tho use  of multi-engined aeroplanes.  Airships  for this, and has been successfully employed in experimentalwould  usually  be provided with  more  than  one engine inany case.  2.  In considering the detail  of  appliances  to  be used inconnection  with safety  on aircraft,  regard must be  hadboth to the prevention of accidents  and the best method ofdealing  with  the  dangers  arising  after  accidents have occurred, whether on tho  ground before commencing a flight,in the air,  or on landing.   It must be realised that experience shows that an  accident to. the machine by no means involves,in  the  majority  of cases,  an  accident to tho  flyer and passenger.   It is probably that the civil use of aircraft willconduce to much  greater  safety  than the  useful standardalready reached, quite apart from any appliances especially since  extreme war performance and  manoeuvring are notcalled for.  3.  Fire. The direction in which  study is advisable in all types  of aircraft is  to try to  arrange for the  main petrolsupply to  bo situated clear of the  hot parts of  the  engine!and away from  the magneto,  and  to  see that  the  exhaustpipes are kept clear of the petrol pipes, and the  exhaust dis-charge is in such a position that a  spark cannot ignite any surplus petrol  flowing away in  the case of  over-filling  of tanks, Or any vapour from exits or leakages.  In some enginesgauze boxes can be  fitted to induction pipes, and the inletducts to carburettors arranged to draw the  air from  outsidethe  structure.   4.  Experiments  have been made,  on  magnetos by making small alterations to enable them to be immersed in an inflamatory- mable- vapour, and  it has been  found that after lowering and raising the pressure on such vapour it did not fire the mixture even when  overflow sparks occurred at  the safety gap.  This preliminary study should be prosecuted, and could probably result in  the, general introduction of such magnetos.Meanwhile tho whole petrol system  is  kept clear of electrical devices, such  as magnetos and wireless,  in  case leakages of petrol should give rise to  vapour in their vicinity. A desirable feature which has  been suggested as  useful is an  arrangement for  shutting off  the petrol  from the  jet  instantly.   This might take the form of a spring-controlled mechanism acting on a  needle fitted with  a quick thread,  which,  through the action of  a spring, could be made to stop up the jet orifice. The object, which is to ensure  the engine  stopping quickly when  desired, could be effected  in various ways, and here also is a  field for  experimental development.  Incidentally this might avoid the danger of an engine running backwards if  overheated.   5. All  overflow  pipes  and pipes  between  the carburettor and the atmosphere are led well outboard, and  care is taken in the making of exhaust manifold joints to avoid the danger of their blowing out.  In the  case  of  rotary engines, which usually have no exhaust pipes, it is usual to cowl them com.flights with airships.  It may be said that parachutes would only be employed inthe case of a serious outbreak of fire, or the breakage of sonwvital  part of the machine.   In.  the  latter case it would generally  bo  problematical  whether the parachute  couldgot free in the former, the problem of fire is best dealt withby  preventive  measures.    Meanwhile the carrying out cfexperiments is  to be  encouraged.  7. Air or Land Brakes. These have a distinct promise efutility for landing in restricted areas.   Several forms of airbrake have already been tried  with more or less success.  Assoon as engines have reached a high standard of reliableness a promising form of air.brake is the variable pitch and rever-sible air-screw.  Land brakes might take the form of a plougheither operated  by  hand  or  automatically making contact with the ground.  A similar purpose would be served by wingsof variable surface or with the camber and angle of incidencecapable of being altered.&apos;   This  latter  development might come with the further increase of flying speeds which is oftenforeshadowed.  8. Instrument for Ascertaining the Attitude of an Aeroplantin a  Cloud. It is understood that considerable importance isattached  to this by pilots.  Neither the ordinary  spring-con&apos;trolled aii&apos; speed indicator  nor the spirit level can  be  relied upon for this purpose.   Only a gravity-controlled instrumentgives for steady flight conditions  the true  angle of  incidenceirrespective  of  whether  the machine  is turning  or  not.  Ithas been suggested that, but for the extreme weight of thogyrostat, a solution might be found in its  adoption, the pilotputting his machine  in  a horizontal position before  entering the cloud and  starting the gyrostat,, which would  continue to indicate the  direction  in  which the axis of the machine was  lying at the instant of  release.   More important  than this is the indication of turning,  an instrument which shows whether a turn  is or is  not being made.  This relieves us of the evil results of certain  peculiarities  of  the aero  compass,   9. Landing at Night. Landing airships at night does not present any  groat difficulty.  The best method has been found to be to  place  beacon lights on the sheds  with a searchlight on the ground pointing up-wind, coupled with steaming lights. The trail rope is also painted white.  Some  similar system, or  petrol or acetylene flares, is  suggested  for  aeroplanes, perhaps   coupled with  carrying  on the  machine  a search- light and parachute flares, to illuminate  the ground in the event of a forced landing.   10. Navigation in Foj/.-This is in part a question of illu- minating arrangements, as, generally speaking, the fog hardly ever extends beyond 2,000  ft.  from the ground, and is purely local.  The  system adopted in  France of  firing star shells to burst over the fog might also be developed along commercial routes.   Landing grounds should be selected as far as possiblepletely with metal cowls and  to keep those8 supporting mem-  in foS,css areas&apos;  and PerhaPs advantage for alighting mightbers which  may  come  near the exhaust  free&quot; from exposedinflammable material.  Any fuel or oil that may be thrown out from the engine is kept within the cowl, and if it shouldcatch fire no damage results.  Nevertheless  such cowls shouldbe drained.  The aircraft of to-day have, except in the casoof airships only,  small  margin of useful  load,  and  theirutility is jeopardised by compulsory  carrying of additionalweights.   Hence fire extinguishers do  not form  an obliga-tory  equipment  until   the  aeroplane attains considerabledimensions, but it is eminently desirable that they should  becarried if possible.  Small extinguishers should be available at  all aerodromes,  but  they must not contain  ingredientslikely to harm fabric or wood work.  6. Pararhvtes.-ln  airships, kite balloons,  and  balloons,the  use  of these, though requiring decision and  courage  onthe  part  of the user, does not offer the  same difficulties asin  the  case of aeroplanes.  It is,  however, in  the present stage of  development inadvisable to jump in a parachuteunder a^ height  of  about 500  ft.   As regards  aeroplanes,opinion is divided as to the advisability  of employing para-chutes, both for the above reasons and because there is  diffi-culty in fixing the parachute in such a position that no part ofresult from specially treating the ground to keep  a dry sur-face.  Research and experiment on the dispersal of fog wouldalso be valuable.  11.  Multiplication of Power Plant in Aeroplanes.--This has-obvious merits in large machines as a guarantee against theresults of engine failure.  Three engines  have some advan-tage over two.  Four-engincd  machines  with one  tractor engine on eachwing, and behind it, a pusher engine with the crank-shaft inthe same line, have been tried and promise well, though theyhave  not yet  been fully tried  out.  As  a  matter ef useful  information required on this classof work it may be said that it  has been found that in twin-engined machines it is not necessary to have opposite-handedengines,  but  that a machine can  be  flown quite successfullywith  two right-handed or two-left-handed engines.  This isan  important simplification for the upkeep of such craft.                                E. M. MAITLAND,                                         Wing  Captain.

93                                            APPENDIX  J.Report  by  Lieut,-Colonel  0&apos;Gorman,  Mr.  Holt  Thomas,  and  Mr.   Lanchester                           on  a  Main  or  Terminal  Aerodrome.  NOTE. This report was  drawn up in answer to a request by the  Special Committee for a  report  upon  a  main orterminal aerodrome suitable for despatching and receiving100 aeroplanes a day, with sufficient housing accommodation for a similar number.             A Main or Terminal Aerodrome.  We do not consider that it is possible to make any con-structive report on this subject on the lines of 100 aeroplanesleaving and arriving per day  and housing for 100 craft.1.  Expenditure.  The cost  of terminal aerodromes is by  no  means so  easilyapproximated to as that of intermediate grounds, for thereason that they will necessarily  be at least on the outskirts of  large centres of population.  It  is accordingly  impossibleto make any estimate of what expenditure might be involved.(It may  be possible to discover what is the  approximateground-rent of Hendon Aerodrome, also its accurate acreage(approximately  200 acres), and to indicate whether  such an aerodrome as this is the minimum which could be reasonablyused for civil transport service in  London, and whether itmay be regarded  as a minimum  type  of  terminal  aero-dromes.)2.  Size.  The minimum size of an aerodrome from the point of viewof  the alighting of single machines, is obviously the size ofthe  intermediate  landing  grounds  indicated  by CaptainRobb in his paragraph 2 of Appendix K, but the actual sizerequired at any terminal  station for,  e.g.,  100 aeroplanes&quot; leaving and arriving &quot; per day depends upon the numberof  aeroplanes  which  may be  expected  to  be  arriving  orleaving simultaneously, and it is  difficult to forecast this with any attempt at precision, since no data  exists on  which to  found an estimate  of the times of starting and arriving.If  we suppose that aeroplane  flying will for preference takeplace by daylight, then it is to be  supposed  that  the  major part of the starting will take place in the morning  and the major part  of the arriving will take place after noon, sinceon broad lines it may be said that the reasonably long flightswill  be economically desirable.  Nevertheless, where the airservice is run to districts which have not  got a good railwayservice, it  will be found that short distance air journeyscan be introduced, and accordingly a certain amount of useof  the aerodrome throughout the middle hours of  the day for leaving and arriving .is to  be expected.  Under the cir-cumstances, it is impossible to discuss the problem on a basisof  a definite number per diem without making some  assump-tion for which data do not at present exist;  we have  there-fore substituted the rate per  hour  and assumed 15 leavingsor  arrivals  per  hour, without expressing  our opinion  as  towhether this corresponds to 100 per diem.  It is thought thatan  aerodrome of  about 200 acres could handle this traffic,especially if the departures were reasonably distinct  fromthe bulk of the arrivals, but for  it to  do  so  it would  benecessary  to have active and  well organised gangs of mento arrange to clear the aerodrome of machines which mayBtop in an  exposed position, and thus leave tho  aerodromefree for other machines.  Compulsory powers of purchase orhiring in default of agreement will no doubt be necessary insome centres.3. Surface.i  In view of the extreme importance to be attached to highwing  loading  and  rapid alighting,  for the purpose  of economy in aircraft construction and use,  the surface of the aerodrome would have to be very much superior to that atpresent existing at Hendon, without actually pressing it tothe point of  being as level  as an ordinary  cricket field.Beyond that it would be imperative that all high buildingshigh hedges  and high trees in  the immediate neighbourhoodshould as far as possible be avoided.4. Soil.  It is clear from experience up to date of.aerodromes, whichare frequently on flat, low-lying land  that  drainage  wouldbe required.  Moreover,  on a certain expanse in front ofthe sheds proposed, there should be tar macadam or otherwaterproof inexpensive flooring.5. Approaches.  These should be similar to those mentioned in paragraph 5of Appendix K.6. Surrounding Country.  See Appendix K, paragraph  6.7. Preparations.  See Appendix K, paragraph 7, save that since the terminalgrounds  will be larger they  will  be proportionately more costly.8. Accommodation.  The  housing for,  say,  100  aeroplanes would  necessarily involved petrol and oil stores,  repair departments, standingbuildings for ground-men, offices, store  for the reception and delivery  of  goods, and, later, station room,  perhaps,  for passengers,  garages for attendant  motor-cars to convey theservice to town centres,  offices for inspectors  and trafficchiefs, etc., and aeroplane sheds so built as to admit thelargest probable aeroplanes.  At the inception of the service on a small scale this expense could no  doubt be deferred orminimised.9. Marking.  It is probable that no  specific  marking will be requiredfor terminal landing grounds,  because their character willbe so very obvious to fliers who are approaching the centrafor  which they are making;   but  arrangements  for  suchdevices as kite balloons for signalling the situation in timeof fog, wireless appliances and meteorological observatoryshould be foreseen.10.  Lighting.1  Paragraph 11 re lighting in Appendix K would  also applyhere.11.  Maintenance.  See paragraph 12 of Appendix K.  The  installation of housing  for 100  aeroplanes on trans-port work at the termini is clearly dependent upon a futurestate of civil aerial  transport, and  need  not be  at onceinstituted as a charge upon  the  nascent  industry.:  Suchcharge could only  be borne if alternative military and navaluse of the facilities were to. form  a means of distributingthe burden of the cost on other shoulders than  the transitcompany&apos;s.  The  eventual need of such  housing no  doubtexists,  but  the cost of such  housing will be so largely dependent on  the size of  aeroplanes used that an estimatewould  be unavoidably misleading  and would  differ at oniterminal station from what it would  be  at another  wherasmaller ciaft might be the main types.                                             23/10/17.
APPENDIX iK,Memorandum  by  Major   E.  Elvey Jtobb as  to Intermediate Landing Grounds.1. Distance apart.  Mr. Holt Thomas, in his recent lecture before the Aero-nautical Society, suggested that the  distance between eachlanding ground  on an aerial route should be ten miles, andat the  inception of civil aerial  transport the provision of landing grounds  on this  scale  would  appear essential inorder .to   minimise  risk  of   accident,   feomo  economymight bo  effected by providing  a regular  landing groundwith  attendance and  accommodation every  twenty  mileswith  facilities   for  forced   landings   midway  betweenevery two landing  grounds.   These facilities   for  forcedlandings on emergency  grounds could bo arranged by carry-ing out a limited amount of  work in the way of .removinghedges, foiling  trees,  etc.  Emergency grounds  would onlybe used in case of absolute necessity.2. Size.-  Each landing  ground should afford a clear run of 600 yardsin every  direction.   If any  serious  obstacles exist  on  the-approaches to the ground, the size of the ground may haveto be increased,  it is not essential to have a  ground  600yards square. An &quot; L&quot; shaped ground will suffice if it affordsa clear run of 600 yards in any direction, provided each armof the &quot; L &quot; is at least 300 yards wide.   Tho area of landing-grounds on this basis will average 60 acres.3. Surface.  The surface should ibe level so that machines can normallyland upon and taxi  across the ground without injury.4. Soil.   Selection will naturally be confined  to  the  line of the aerial route,  but, subject to this, landing grounds  should, as far  as practicable,  be  chosen on  light,  porous soil withnatural drainage.  Grounds with clay soil invariably requirespecial  drainage.,5. Approaches.   The  approaches-or,  at  all events, the  majority  of the approaches should be open and free from  serious -obstacles.It  will frequently  be necessary  to  fell trees,  remove hay-stacks, etc., on adjoining grounds, and  telephone  and tele-,graph  wires on roads  bounding  landing grounds will have to be -lowered  or carried underground.  Statutory  powers for those purposes will be required. 6.  Surrounding country.   This should afford facilities for forced landings in case of engine failure when &apos;&apos;. taking off.&quot; 7. Preparation.   This -will consist  ,mainly of grubbing  hedges,  piping, and filling  in or hoarding  over ditches and watercourses, level-ling, tree-felling, etc.  The  cost of  preparation will natu- rally vary according  to the  nature of the site and the amount of work involved. An average expenditure of . 1,500 will cover the cost  of preparing landing grounds.   Compen- sation payable to the owner and occupier for disturbance (other than  to crops)  will  average   500  per  ground, making  a  total  of    2,000   per  ground.   The  cost of  preparing  &quot; emergency  grounds &quot;   will  averago  750 per ground, and  350 per ground should cover compensation (other than  crops)  1,100  per ground in  all.  Statutory powers authorising the necessary  work of  preparation  in default of agreement,  and prescribing a  method of ascer- taining the-compensation will be necessary. 8.  Accommodation.   At intermediate  lauding grounds  not oised for  the recep- tion of passengers or -freight,  and  where no  provision for --carrying  out  serious  repairs  is contemplated,  the  only:accommodation required for landing purposes will be :       (a) Attendant &apos;s  hut with exchange telephone  connec-         tion;      (b) Small store for petrol and oil,   This accommodation can be provided for the average cost of  400, which includes provision for telephone connection, which will be  a serious item in some districts. 9. Cast of hire.   This  will  average  1  pen  acre  per annum  throughout Great Britain.   To this figure must be added, for  the first  year in  the case of arable,  4 per  acre, and in the case of  pasture,  1  per acre for tenant right and disturbance^ of crops.  These  figures  are additional  to  the  compensation  estimated  in paragraph 7.  This estimate is  based on actual experience with military landing  grounds, and  it should  be  stated that  the figures referred to have only  been  arrivedat  by careful  management.  Grazing  has  been permittalsubject  to  the restrictions  mentioned  below, and  certailgrounds have been  put out  of  action during the months mMay and June  to  enable them to  bo laid clown to hay,  lJsome  cases, grounds managed on theso  lines,  have shewn ismall  profit and this has brought  down  the average cost tithe figure  mentioned.   How far  it would  be possible tldeal with landing grounds on an aerial route in this  mannJis  a doubtful  question.  Grazing  on landing grounds  is Jmatter that requires very close attention,  and  it is necessarlto pen the stock or place it under the control of a shepherlor  dog.  Experience has shown that in  the daytime shecplonly should  be permitted to  graze on landing grounds oil which any extensive uso is made.-  On grounds which are no!in  use  during  tho night,  stock of  all descriptions can IjJgrazed from dusk to dawn.  If &quot;no arrangements for graziujor  laying down to  hay are permissible, the estimated costlof  hire would be   1 10s. per acre.  Compulsory powers foilpurchase or hiring in default of agreement will be necessary!10. Marking.  It is difficult from the air to distinguish landing grounds!from the surrounding  country, and they, therefore, requillmarking in ,a  distinctive manner.  A chalk circle 100 feelin  diameter and  with a band 3  ft. wide, has proved  verification effective, and  can  be  seen  from  practically  any attainably height on a  clear day.  It  is necessary to keep  the sign 1good  white colour so  that  it stands out well,  and this ii done by lime-washing  the  chalk  from  time to time.   Thsl name of the ground should also be marked in chalk letter! 15 feet long  by 3  feet wide.  Emergency grounds shoullj have  a distinctive  sign to  distinguish them from  regulafl landing grounds. 11. Lighting.   Numerous experiments  in  methods  of lighting  landing grounds have  been tried.  The  result of a  large  amount! of experience  in  night flying is  that  pilots, prefer slmplJmethods. A number of paraffin or petrol flares, arranged ij such  a manner  as to indicate the existence  of  a  landiaj ground and to illuminate the landing area,  has proved most effective method.  The position  or  number of  thtl flares can be varied in a similar manner so  as to  indicate! to a pdot the locality of the ground.  In some cases,  it isl necessary  to  indicate  obstacles on the approaches to and! exits from landing grounds by red lamps.    There are various&apos; minor details in  connection  with thJ lighting  of landing grounds  which require  consideration! as to which detailed information  can&apos; be given if required! The  above  particulars  will,  however,  suffice  to show  thai in the ordinary  way the lighting of these grounds  is simple and  relatively inexpensive matter. 12. Maintenance  of Landing Grounds    Tho grass requires cutting or&apos; grazing and the groundl rolling from time to time. 13. Summary  of estimated expenditure on preparation anoj       hiring.

Final  Report [of  Special [Committee No. 2.    Special Committee No. 2 submit the following report, dealing as far as appears possible at present,  with those  matters  referred to them which are not  covered by their Interim Report.                      AERIAL TRANSPORT OE1  PASSENGERS AND GOODS.    In considering the practical  possibilities  of aerial transport generally, the Special Committee, in their interim report, dealt  more particularly^  (see page 43) with  air mail services.  In  their present report the Committee propose to deal with the carriage of passengers and goods, including the question of the probability or otherwise of the, use of privately-owned aircraft. .    As to the  types of machines  which are likely to be used  in commercial services, the Committee desire (o.emphasise one aspect-of the technical  reports of Colonel  0&apos;Gorman and Mr. Bairstow, which, are appended to their interim report as Appendices A and  C.  These reports were furnished in answer to a request by the Committee that four widely different types of aeroplane now  in military use should form the basis  of a report as to the limits of the capacity of aeroplanes generally.  The four .types were selected so as to cover -the  whole range of existing machines, and the estimates given  of the performances to  be expected are illus- trative of the  possibilities of  aeroplanes generally.   Thus, the data set forth in these reports can be  used as a basis for  estimating the performance of the commercial aeroplane in the immediate post-war period. The  variations  in  design which commercial  services will  render  necessary are  only of  a secondary character.  There  is  no  difficulty in adapting  aeroplanes to the carriage of passengers and goods, as  well as of letter mails.  The case is different  with airships.  As far as airships  are concerned, it will  be  observedtfrom  the report by  Wing Captain Maitland, which is  attached hereto as Appendix A, that while the existing types, which  possess  a very large proportion of  disposable lift, may be  expected to prove,  within limits, suitable for commercial work, far better results could be obtained  by specially designed  airships, as the  lines  of development, up to the present, which have been purely military, have not  been  such as to produce the most suitable airship for commercial purposes.    Generally  speaking,  the  Committee are of  opinion&apos;that the carriage in aircraft  of  mails,  passengers, and goods will present no difficulty from the  technical point of view.   It would  appear from  their terms of reference, which mention the  question of running costs, ithat the  Committee  were expected to attempt some forecast  of the probabilities of the commercial success of  such  carriage.  This has proved practically impossible from the lack  of any experience of commercial  aerial transport up  to  the present  time.   The mount of business over which a civil  aerial transport company would have to spread its standing charges is therefore a  matter of uncertainty.    Moreover, in the absence of any reliable forecast of the amount of business  over  which  aircraft  manufacturers after the war  will have to spread their  standing charges, the prime cost after the war of the machines, upon which the cost of using them must largely depend, cannot be even  approximately estimated.   The Committee feel that they are safe in saying  that-, given a demand for  the carriage of mails, passengers, and goods, there are no  practical obstacles in the  way of organising aerial  services  to meet that demand.    The Committee would again point out that, in  initiating  aerial trans- port services, due advantage should be taken of the novel  facilities offered by the use of aircraft, e.g.,    (1)  In the case of mails, by competing with telegraphic services or in establishing a new type of express letter  service;    (2)  In the  case of passengers, by  competing with rail,  marine,  and road services over long distances,&apos; or where the journey either includes sea as well as land  passages,  or is  between  places  not  conveniently served by rail.    (3) In the case of goods,  by enabling ordinary merchandise, commercial samples, and even (if necessary) spare  parts&apos; of  machinery urgently required, to be conveyed  quickly  to  places otherwise inaccessible except by journeys involving great expenditure of time.    While it is quite possible that the  earlier commercial  use of aircraft  will  take - the  form of  regular services,  particularly  in  the case of letter mails, the  Committee  suggest  that  one  of the  first  methods of employing  aeroplanes  for the transport  of passengers may  lie not in the flying of craft  between cities at specified  times, but in the occasional and increasing use of single machines for rapid journeys in any direc- tion,  rather than along a fixed route,  carrying one or more occupants who may be prepared, owing to the urgency  of their business, to  pay special  fees so as  to secure the high speed of transit which will be possible by air.    Such first and  occasional passenger  work, which might  increase until it provided an appreciable but not large source of  revenue,  would  have the  advantage  of educating the  public  as to the rapidity of aerial transit-thus preparing them for  the time when regular services were started-could be undertaken immediately peace comes, since it would  not be open to the same objection  as would  any premature attempt to run a daily service to schedule irrespective of weather conditions.    After the  war, therefore,  we can contemplate the systematic organisation. of  existing resources in the shape of  aerodromes, pilots, and suitable  machines,  so that passenger craft,  flown by skilled  and reliable men,  could be hired at so much  per mile or day for  rapid journeys.   It should be  possible to arrange things so that a busy man might engage a machine for a journey from London to Dublin, Paris,  Stockholm, or the like  by telephone from  any  post office or  convenient public office.  The wide use of such a service would depend largely on the facilities being universally known and understood, and upon its being generally acces- sible  under standard conditions.  Otherwise it might become  only an  occasional convenience for people with sufficient leisure to make the necessary enquiries and  arrangements.  The  development of services of this kind in their  earlier  stages might provide an outlet for a  certain number of surplus military machines  of a typa adaptable to passenger carrying.
                                PRIVATELY OWNED AIRCRAFT.&quot;    The probable use of privately owned  aircraft will largely depend  on  the development  of  aerOnautiffias a recreation and a sport. This, again, will depend largely on the cost of the acquisition and use of aircraft;But since there will exist at the end of the war sufficient facilities in the shape of landing grounds to renJlflying by clay free from any particular risk,  although defined  routes may be lacking, the Committee suggXthat for the general  encouragement of aeronautics, the establishment of  flying clubs might be valuable. SuBclubs could be either promoted  by the proprietors of aerodromes, who would be in a position to offer  speciBtfacilities  for storing machines and providing  club premises, or could be  formed by  associations of  flyeBleaving the Services  at the conclusion of the war, rather in the manner of non-proprietary social or spormclubs.  Such  flyers might thus  be enabled  to  make rise of  aeroplanes at a reasonable expense and to himthemselves in practice.   These clubs might find employment for a  small percentage of such machines flfmay be  surplus  to  naval  and  military requirements, and  they would tend to stimulate the  design aftconstruction of pleasure and touring type machines.                                                  I                                       AERIAL ROUTES.    The Committee have considered Item  6 of their terms of reference, viz. :  What main aerial routs!might be  marked out and prepared  for now for utilisation by an aircraft service.   The Committee do nJthink that they can, in the light of information now available, usefully add  anything to their interi!report.  With regard to the Atlantic route mentioned  in that report, they  have made further  enquiriias to the prevalence  of fog on  the coast of Newfoundland  from  Sir  E.  Morris,  and  Mr.  H.  (jThomson, of the Newfoundland Railway and Train Ferry Syndicate, Ltd.  The answers to these enquiries which are attached as Appendix B,  confirm the view that the  fog  does not as a rule rise very high above tilsurface of the sea,  and  that it does  not generally extend more than a mile or two inland.             *                                                                                      i                                   AERIAL MAIL SERVICES.

In the first place, the design  and  construction of airships I lias up to the present in all countries been mainly confined to I the Services, and  where  private firms have been concerned they   have been engaged  on  producing airships suitable for [military purposes.  In taking  airship performances during the Uar  as  a standard of  future  commercial development it I should, therefore, be remembered how vastly different are the  requirements of  commercial- and passenger-carrying airships  to those which have hitherto been paramount  in the minds  of constructors.   The  modern  Zeppelin, for instance, is  designed   for  rapidity of climb,  the  attainment  of  great  heights, and the carrying  of large quantities of bombs,  speed  heing a secondary consideration.   In a commercial airship increased  speed will be necessary if a regular  service  is to be  maintained, while a height of 1,000 ft.  will be ample  for  normal  flying, though greater heights should be attainable if necessary.  The weight-lifting feature  would   be retained for  the  carrying of goods and passengers.   Existing German military airships have proved themselves capable of attaining a maximum speed.of over 60 m.p.L, with i &quot; disposable lift &quot; available for crew, fuel, bombs, etc., of over 30 tons, remaining in the  air for something like 36 hours, and  attaining a  height w-hen  over  this country of 18,000 or 19,000  ft.  There is little  doubt that a  commercial rigid airship could he constructed to-day with a maximum speed of  75-80 m.p.h.,; capable of covering 2,000 miles with a load of cargo of  12-15 tons; or 600 miles  with 30 tons of cargo (or 210 passengers ffith 50 lbs. of luggage each).  With care in  designing it should be possible to design  an airship  having the speed  named  with comparatively slight increase in engine power and of the same size as the present- day  Zeppelins.   The  Germans, owing to the necessity for rapid output, have adopted a  comparatively  inefficient form,Lirom the aerodynamic point of view,  but with an airship oiItrue stream-line  form  the higher speeds should be easilyattainable.                                             J   The fact that a number of Zeppelins have  been  brought down over this country and in France does  not  affect  the value of airships  for commercial purposes, as tho  inflamma- bility of the gas with which they are filled does not give rise to any  danger in normal  flying.  In spite of  the enormous amount of flying  which has been carried out  by  airships in this country during the war, there has been no case of  the destruction of one of these craft owing to its. catching  fire in the air.   One of the objections to airships which is frequently raised is their inability to fly in strong winds.  This  is in part due to the&apos; comparatively slow speeds which have  been obtained up to the present, for the  reasons stated above,  and which can undoubtedly be improved  upon with careful attention  to design having  that end in view.  It  is,  however, largely dueto the difficulty of handling  airships on the ground in high winds owing  to the  large surface they offer  to  the wind. There is no doubt that this  difficulty  would  be,  to a con-siderable extent, overcome by the adoption of revolving shedson land or floating sheds on  water.  The best method, how-ever,  undoubtedly, would  be to abolish sheds altogether except for docking purposes- and. maintain the airships per-manently moored out.   The many practical advantages which the airship possesses for commercial purposes are not, perhaps, always appreciated.   Present-day airships, which in no way approach the limit of size, as has already been pointed out,  have a  disposable lift of over 30 tons,  which enables them ro embark on long flights without the necessity of descending  i&apos;or replenishment of fuel.   The initial weight  of the power  plant  is, for  the same reason, of less consequence than in the case of the aeroplane, which renders efficient silencing possible,  and at  the same time simplifies design  owing to the weights not having to bo cut down to so fine a point.  There is no reason why an air- ship should not be fitted with engines as silent  as those of a motor-car.  Sleeping  accommodation can,  in any case,  be provided well away from the power&quot; plant, and  there is com- plete  absence of  such noises as the  singing  of  wires which would  detract from the comfort  of  passengers  in an  aero- plane.  In  this  connection it may be pointed out that  inthis country airships have up to the present owing to thepjjfc,^ Since -this report was presented to the Main Committee, the detailed recommendations in Appendix  E have been incorporated in1&apos;appendix A to the Report of Special Committee No. 1.   See p. 32.                                .fpeeiS Committee No    See pG35eS     Colonel 0&apos;Gorraan as to Appendix E will be found at the end of Appendix A to the Report of
limitations of output-necessarily been fitted with  enginesdesigned for aeroplanes.  The special requirements of an air-ship engine are  too detailed to be gone into here, but  greatimprovements are undoubtedly obtainable by the use of suchengines.  An airship can remain in the air however  low thospeed may be, so that the engines can be throttled down when required, thus offocting considerable economy in  petrol con-sumption;  while the fact that thei engines  need not neces-sarily be run for long periods of time at full speed has obviousadvantages from tho design standpoint.  The. power plant can  be readily split up into as many, unitsas desired-there -being  no advantage in  concentrating thoweights-and  failure  in tho * power-plant does  not  involveimmediate  descent, while  running  repairs can  easily  beeffected in  the air.  Even with landing grounds  only ten miles apart an aero-plane would be compelled to liy at a minimum height/of  about,000 ft., whereas an  airship  can cruise  with safety a fewhundred feet above the graund, which considerably enhancesthe pleasure  of passengers by  affording them an  opportunityof enjoying the  scenery.  The difficulty  which  an aeroplane pilot has in  judging thoattitude of his machine to the horizontal at night, or in fog,rniSjt,  or cloud, does not obtain in an airship, which aljiremains on an even keel.  An   airship can set out  on long flights over themarshy and wooded country without fearing  engine faifjAt &quot;intermediate stopping places it can come down to da few hundred feet  of the  ground and moor to a gnJ(or  drogue if over tho sea) to replenish fuel, without actiijlanding.   Similarly,  an airship can fly at night withJpleto  safety, navigation  being carried out by the qrd.ynaval instruments and -observations of the stars made fja steady  platform on the top  surface.  In conclusion, the commercial airship of the not-far distfuture will have a &quot; disposable lift &quot; available for crew fland merchandise,  or  passengers of 50 to 60 tons or rajIt will have a speed of 90 to 100 miles per hour, with aajaccommodation for passengers in the shape of saloon, drawilroom, smoking-room and state-rooms, with a lift giving adto a roof  garden on  the  top,  and will  be  able to remain!the air for  a week or more at a time.  After  a joxirnejlwill return  to moorings like a water-borne ship, only bjhoused in a  shed for periodic overhaul.December, 1917.E.

Morris,  to Lt.-Col, Wayland,                  dated 3rd Jan., 1918.  &quot;I  am much interested in the question of  fog  on thecoast  of  Newfoundland  in its  bearing on the  question nowbeing considered by the Civil Aerial Transport  Committee.I have lived all  my life  in  Newfoundland, and have fre-quently sailed  in the spring,  summer  and autumn  seasonsaround the coasts of the country and Labrador.  Betweenthe ages of fifteen and eighteen I lived at  a place  inPlacentia Bay,  probably the  bay in  Newfoundland havingthe highest  percentage of  fog.    puring these  years  Icruised and sailed a small pleasure yacht, and I can speak with  a certain  amount of personal experience.  Generallyspeaking, Newfoundland inland or along her  coasts has  nofog- which could correctly be  designated as  &quot;local.&apos;  Ourfpg comes in from the  Atlantic Ocean  when  the winds arebetween   North-East and south-West.   There  are  seasonswhen eye,n with a S.-W. or N.-E. wind we may not have a fog.We never by any chance  have fog when the winds are fromany point between S.-W. going  West around to the N.-E.It follows  that  as  our prevailing  winds, sometimes con-tinuously for months, are from the W. and N.-W.  we have very little fog.   I have seen  a whole  season  from  April to november pass without rain or fog.   When the fog doescome in  from  some atmospheric cause, it lies low right.down on the water, and  it is a  common occurrence to  seethe sun shining on the hill-tops and fog down on the sea.So much so is this the rule that the practice is to build our lighthouses on  high promontories from five to  six hundredfeet high.  Further, as a rule, the fog does  not penetrateinland very far, but is eaten up and  absorbed  by the land over  which it  hangs and it  is  a usual and  common dailyoccurrence to see a bank of fog outside the harbour and aglorious sunny  day inside without a vestige of fog. Further.the fog  is  perfectly white,  and although  at times thick,would.not, I fancy, be found too  dense for landing from  theair, as I think it will be found that the fog  does not reach the  height at  which  airmen fly.   Under  all  the  circum-stances,  I think it will be found that  there  are no special difficulties in the way  of Newfoundland being  the  landing station on the western side  of  the Atlantic for any aero- plane service after the war.   Further, T think on  enquiry-it will not be difficult to procure evidence to support (position.&quot;Copy of letter from Mr. H. G. Thomson to Lt.-Col. Wmk                 ,dated  Uth Dec., 1917.  &quot; In reply to your request for  further information atthe, nature of the Newfoundland  fog, I may say fromown experience that the fog does not, as a rule, rise ihigh above the, surface of the sea.   From .some littleoff it can often be seen lying on the sea like a regular Iof fog with clear sky above it.  Sometimes, too, when illbo dense on  the  water &apos;s  edge that one can hardly sship&apos;s length off,  it is so  thin  above  that the sky can,be made out.  Very often, too, there is a clear belt betwthe  fog  and&apos; the  land-the land,  as the sailors  say, &apos;ethe fog,&apos; and even when  it closes right in on the coast,only  extends a very  short  distance  inland.  I -have oftseen St. John&apos;s so enveloped in fog that the harbour cambe seen at all, whilst  a  mile or two  inland there is-brijsunshine.   &quot; In the interior there is very  little fog indeed.  I wrifrom recollection,  but  I  think  Lord  Northcliffe  di)attention to this  in  a speech he made some four oryears ago   at  a  meeting  of  - the Anglo-Newfoundli]Development Company.   &apos;-&apos; I will  try and get this  for  you  next week.  Therealso a remarkably clear  belt stretching across  the  GulfSt.  Lawrence from St. George&apos;s Bay on  the west coast.Newfoundland to Chatham in New Brunswick.   &quot; The average  of ,fog  in St. George&apos;s Bay, you  willfrom the iighthouse  percentages I send you, is so sni as to  be  practically  negligible, and  the  enclosed cor spondence and the statistics,furnished by  the Meteorologi Office some years ago shows that the fog at Chatham also  exceedingly  small, much less than either to the Ho or to the South of it.   &quot; There are many  excellent landing  places round John&apos;s,  and as  it is the  capital of the island  it jwo  probably be the best  halting place for passengers; and flight from there to  St. Greorge&apos;s Bay would  be over land all the,way, and  freer from fog  than if a landingiv made near Cape Bace and the flight continued from ther                                                 APPENDIX  C.Revised Memorandum  by the  Assistant  Secretary (Technical) as  to an Express Air-Ma             Seryice between London  and Glasgow, via Newcastle  and Edinburgh.

The service  contemplated  in  this memorandum is a purely express service.   Others will doubtless  be established,such, for example,  as  those in which large machines will carry passengers and, parcels as well as mails.  A  London-Glasgow service has been chosen for illustrationfor  several  reasons.    In  the first place,  it requires  atleast a  250  miles&apos; flight,  at an average,  say, of 120 milesan  hour, such  as  that  from  London  to  Newcastle,  to demonstrate  the speed of  an express air service,  and  forthis speed to offer a sufficiently -marked saving of time overrailway  transit,  remembering that one  must  reckon  thetime taken  in  establishing ,the land connections of an  airservice.            - .

                              Report  of  Special  Committee  No.  3.&apos;\   li The Special Committee were asked to advise as to the development and organisation of aircraft produttion from a commercial and financial point of view, with special reference to-    (1) The encouragement of the production throughout the Empire of the various types of aircraft requirel        for organised aerial services, particularly so as to ensure a sufficient margin of  supply for milil        and naval requirements.                                                                      &apos;    (2) The probable availability of capital for use in the  production of aircraft  and  in  organising aerial     .   services, and the possible necessity of State ownership or of State aid to private enterprise in %        respects,  either by direct subvention or by specially favourable treatment of some other kind.    (3) The possible necessity for some special control over the raising of fresh capital by companies or firm,        engaged in the production of  aircraft  and the running of aerial services.    (4) The possible necessity, after the  conclusion of the war, of immediate measures to protect such exist-        ing trade interests as are  dependent upon war contracts.    (5) The extent to which existing organisations, working under war pressure conditions,  will requirek        be modified in order to establish them  on a permanent peace basis.    (6) The consideration  of the cost of production of aircraft.    2. At the outset of their enquiry the Committee have met  with certain difficulties which  are necessariliinherent in the problems on which they have been asked to advise. The aircraft industry, as it exists to-day,is  an  organisation amply equipped with capital, material, machinery, expert knowledge,  and  trained labour-but at the same time  it owes its  development and its  present  position  wholly  to  the phenomenal  mdemands of the naval and military authorities.  Tor this reason it  cannot be regarded in relation to post-war problems  of reconstruction in the same  light as other  established  British industries.   There is no  past experience of  trade on a peace basis to guide the Committee,  and, since the  post-war aerial  programme of the  Government must necessarily depend  on a number of military, naval, and financial considerations, whiclit  is impossible at this  stage to forecast, and  indeed upon the result of the war itself, it cannot be expectelthat any authoritative information can bo furnished as to the probable  direct Government demand  for ail-craft on a peace basis.    3. Assuming, however, that there will be some considerable diminution of  direct  Government orden at the end of the war, the Committee  have thought it advisable to consider first of all the position of fl)aircraft industry generally at that time, and more particularly during the interval which may be expects! (o occur between  the probable diminution of naval and military orders for the Air Forces at the conclusionof peace (whatever, the  extent of  such diminution may  be)  and the renewal  of  such orders  coupled  wifesome  possible orders  for civil aerial  transport  purposes;  and,  secondly,   the  constructive  steps  whitishould be taken to bridge that interval.    4. In  presenting their  views  and recommendations, the  Special Committee  desire  to emphasise &quot;whijthey regard throughout  as  an  incontestable assumption, namely, that aerial  power will  be as  necessary fathe protection of Great Britain and the existence of the. Empire in  the future as naval power has been iithe past.   The Committee are accordingly of  opinion that it will be necessary, after the conclusion of tit&apos;War-, to take  such measures as will maintain the power of  production  in  this country,  with its attendant;power of  design and progressive experiment.  Without  continuity  it  would be  impossible  to  have  ftorganisation immediately available when required. Furthermore, if such a policy for National  Aerial Defendis  adopted  as will have the effect of maintaining the  aircraft  industry on  a reasonably sound basis, ftdevelopment of aviation for civil aerial  transport should jbe  the more rapid, inasmuch as those engaged ithe industry will  possess this power of design and production, backed  by the  necessary financial resouraavailable  for  extension  to the development of aviation in its civil and commercial aspects.    5. If the  expectation is justified that  at the end of the war there will be a  considerable  falling offiidirect  Government orders and it has to be borne in mind that even  if  the same  aerial force that exist!at the end  of the war is to be maintained  on a peace basis the falling off will be great, owing to the muttlonger expectation of life  of aircraft under  peace as compared with war conditions-the  conclusion of peacewill bring with it a reduction not only in the number of firms engaged in  the  industry, but  also, by ftcessation  of overtime and  night shifts, in the output of the remaining firms.   But, when  such establishmentsas are at present  engaged  as a temporary war  measure in aircraft building  have  reverted to  their norm;pre-war businesses, the productive capacity  of the remaining establishments may still be  more than is neces-sary to maintain the National Aerial Services.    6. With regard to the probable development of aerial transport services,  the  Special.Committee woullrefer  to the facilities which this form  of  transport will provide in letter mail services and in journeys  overlong distances, or where  other means of transport are  undeveloped or do  not furnish   direct  connection!.It.is thought that  fast aerial mail services should soon be  able to  compete with expensive  long-distance cableservices, as, for instance,  from London to South Africa.   Yet their  development  will be gradual, and thenumber of  aircraft they will employ, in the earlier years, at any  rate, will  be  small, because, even on&apos;sanguine  view of the amount of letters which  will be sent by air mail at a high rate of postage, the weighof them  will not be great, while passengers will be  few.  It  is  hardly to  be supposed&quot; that newspapers  anprinted matter will be sent in  large quantities by  air  mail for some time to come.  It has to be borne imind, too, that air routes will  be mainly  international, and that foreign countries will  expect that a sha&quot;in the business will be given to their own aircraft.   Viewed,  therefore,  as  a commercial  proposition, tiCommittee do not think  that  civil.aerial transport  is  likely,  at  least  for some  years to come, to  develoto such an extent as to involve  any appreciable volume  of orders being placed with the productive side othe industry  in this  country.   As far  as the immediate-post-war  period,is concerned, it should be remejjbered  that  machines for civil and  commercial purposes  will unquestionably  need to be  specially developed and any considerable volume of orders will have  to await the completion  of this process of  development the Committee,  therefore, come  to  the conclusion  that, while aerial transport services  will ultimately  oPhopeful prospects from  the financial point  of view,  the construction  of aircraft  for that purpose,  even
the services attain to the fullest dimensions that can reasonably be anticipated, could for some time to comeonly reach comparatively negligible proportions, and will be  such  as to be by itself wholly inadequate for themaintenance of the aircraft industry, even on a  greatly reduced basis.   7. The conclusions of the Committee  as to the first question mentioned in paragraph  3 above may besummarised as follows :    (a) The Committee are unable to  foresee any such  early development of civil aerial transport as could       by itself keep the aircraft manufacturing industry alive.   (b) It is  essential that the services of the  aircraft manufacturing industry continue to be employed for       the design and development of naval  and military aircraft,   and  for  the  carrying out  of the       national constructional requirements of the future.  If  that  is  done, then no special steps would       seem  to be  required  in  connection  with civil aerial transport to establish  the industry on a perma-       nent peace basis.   (c) Failing the  employment of the  aircraft manufacturing  industry  for the purposes and to  the full       extent above indicated, then the industry could  only be kept  alive for  civil aerial  transport pur-       poses by active Government assistance, not necessarily  in the form of  subsidies  on manufacture,       continued over several years to come.The foregoing conclusions point to the necessity of some constructive  steps being taken to  ensure  the main-tenance of the aircraft industry.    8. In considering the position of the aircraft industry on the termination of the  war the Committee have&apos;had before them an interesting memorandum by Mr. A. E. Turner, which is presented as an Appendix to thepresent Report.   9. Before offering  suggestions as to  the constructive steps to be taken, the Commitee  desire to pointout that it is of the first importance that the  task of considering  and of dealing with constructive proposals in regard to all aeronautical matters after the  war should be definitely assigned without delay to some one government Department which would, of course, only act   after  consultation with  such other GovernmentDepartments  as might be concerned.   It  appears to the Committee that such matters should be dealt withby a single Central Government Authority, but that, to be effective for  this purpose the Authority should workin.conjunction with a body representing the  Industry.   10. The Committee are of opinion  that the solution of the problem of the constructive steps to be taken, and with  it the  solution of the  problem  raised in the second  heading  of  the  terms of  reference to the Main Committee  as  to  the- disposal of the surplus of machines likely to be in the hands  of the Naval and Military authorities after the war,  should  be  sought along the lines  of so using this surplus  as to stimulate immediately a &quot;demand for aeroplanes in  some new direction.   The Committee therefore recommend:     (a) That an offer should be made by the Home Government  to   the  larger self-governing  Dominions       and  to Egypt and  India  to  supply a definite number  of Tnachines, free  of cost, as soon as they       become available,  conditionally on  these countries, in  the  meantime, submitting  approved schemes       for the formation of units of  an Imperial Air Force.    (b) That the  Government should announce that in the event of  the  formation of companies for aerial        transport services,  or other commercial purposes, they would be prepared to afford facilities for       the purchase of machines  at  a  reduced price (say, one-quarter or less fraction of the original cost)       to substantial companies.  This  will operate to facilitate the employment  of pilots who will  be       returning to,civil life on demobilisation. These two proposals  taken jointly would relieve the Government of heavy  expenses  in  providing storage accommodation for   machines which  are too  valuable for  destruction, and should also relieve the stagnation in the design  of military  types which would inevitably  occur if the  necessity of using up large stocks  of surplus aeroplanes prevented the authorities from,placing any but the  smallest possible orders for machines of new design. The design of aeroplanes expressly for civil purposes would also receive a stimulus, as the companies would early begin to find points in which the machines thus taken over  were  susceptible of im- provement from the point of view of the new use to which they were being put.    11. On the broad  question which  was raised at the first meeting of the Main Committee of State owner-- ship  against private  enterprise, the Special Committee hold the view  that the industry of aircraft productionpad transport should be  so deal with as to interfere as little as possible with individual enterprise.    12, The  foregoing paragraphs cover,  so  far  as seems possible in the light of such information as.is avail-jjhle, the  subject matter of headings (1), (2),  (4), and (5)  of  the terms  of  reference to the  Committee.  Datalire wholly lacking-by which to estimate the cost of production of aircraft or the  running costs of civil aerialJ services after  the war, and the Committee fear that detailed discussion of the subject matter of headings. (3)pad (6) of their terms of reference would  be  premature at the present  stage, and could serve no good purpose.                                                    H.

Mervyn 0&apos;Gorman, Lt.-Colonel.    1. While I  accept&apos; the conclusion tfyat&apos; present conditions do&apos; not justify the  advice that the  State hereshould immediately itself undertake the industry of aircraft production, and that, therefore, constructive steps are necessary to ensure the maintenance of that industry by the enterprise of the firms and companies  whichhold the field, I consider that before  long  the  wisdom of establishing State control of and active participa-tion in  that industry will be recognised, and practical steps will be taken&apos; in that direction&apos; for the benefit ofthe nation.    2. I do not  discern any insuperable obstacles  in the way  of an early practical  commencement of civil aerial transport  within the United Kingdom as a  State undertaking, or  under direct  State control, and  regret that it  has not been found possible to include in this report practical suggestions  for experiments inthat direction at the earliest possible moment.

G398                   Supplementary   Report  of   Special  Committee  No.  3.-     1.  The Special Committee have been  asked to consider certain points raised&apos; by Captain  Groves1 in  aMoticc  of  Motion handed in to the Main  Committee.  The Special Committee had not previously dealt with  these points because by their terms of- reference they were called  upon, rather to  advise1 as  to  the  probable  position of the aircraft manufacturing  industry in  this country  at  the  end  of the war, than  to  consider  whether it&apos; was necessary im the  general interest of the State to take special steps to foster the civil use of  aircraft&apos;.      2.  They have now considered the  further points referred to them, and desire to emphasise that it is of  great importance, in the national interest,  that the use of aircraft for civil purposes should&apos; by some means  or other be fostered to the utmost extent,  and with the utmost rapidity possible, immediately after the war.      One reason is that the civil use of  aircraft will ultimately play an important  part in  the commerce  and  transport of the future, and it is undesirable that the British  Empire should  fail,  through allowing  other  countries to  be first in the field,  to secure its due share of such commerce and transport.   ,      A second and very vital reason is that  in any future, war the air will  play a  more important part  than  ever, and unless the State is to maintain on a peace establishment a naval and military air force as large as  it will require in1 any future war, there must be a reservoir of aerial power capable of meeting a sudden demand  for  the  expansion of  the naval and military air force, just as&apos;the  shipbuilding industry and the Mercantile  Marine are capable of meeting such a demand on the part of the Admiralty.                t      3.  It has  been shown in the  previous report of the Special Committee that if the aircraft manufacturing  industry is to be  almost wholly dependent  on direct State orders for naval and  military aircraft, and  such  orders fall off greatly at the end of the war, as it is only prudent to assume  that  .they will  do, the aircraft  manufacturing industry  will dwindle with great rapidity.   Therefore,  in order to  keep  the manufacturing  industry in a state of healthy activity, and to secure that there shall be as  large as possible a number of air-  craft and of  skilled and practised flyers in  existence available to  be drawn upon  by the  State, it is vitally  important that a market should  be created for aircraft other than that  provided  by the  State&apos;s direct naval  and military orders.         ,      4.  It is  not enough merely to maintain the aircraft manufacturing industry in a static condition : it is  necessary, particularly in an industry  which is still at so early a stage  of its growth,, that  there should be  every opportunity and inducement for the  inventor and for  progressive  development and improvement in  design.  This consideration only serves to emphasise the importance of immediate steps being taken to foster  the  civil commercial use of aircraft.  Progress and  improvement  are likely to be best stimulated by  the hope  of commercial gain, as  has been shown in the history of other industries, notably that of shipbuilding.      5. The Special Committee adhere to the view  expressed in  their earlier report that it  is impossible to  foresee any such early development of civil aerial transport as could by itself keep the aircraft manufacturing  industry alive; but it follows from what has  been said above that it must be  developed at  any rate to such an  extent as will  ensure that the resulting orders will suffice,  along with such  direct naval and military orders  as continue to  be given after the war, to secure the end in view.      This end&apos; will have been achieved when a system of properly  planned and predetermined air routes has  been instituted, with their aerodromes  and  other requirements, satisfying both military and commercial needs,  between which there is no real conflict.  On these routes there should be civil aerial services wherever there  is a reasonable demand for the facilities of aerial traffic and irrespective of the test of financial success.   Such  services should ensure a  large reserve  of skilled airmen and of aircraft available for, at any rate, subsidiary  military purposes, and should  afford a market for  aircraft  manufacture sufficient to maintain the manufac-  turing industry on a scale allowing of a prompt and large expansion of the industry for war purposes.      6.  The development of civil aerial transport to the extent outlined in the preceding paragraph cannot, in  the  opinion of the Special Committee, be brought about without some State action.      The State may :       (A) Give its assistance in one or more  of many possible forms to private enterprise; or      (B) may itself own and operate or participate in the ownership  and  operation of aerial transport under-          takings.      ..                        &apos;                                                                   j      7.  These alternative policies have been  very fully discussed by this Committee, and it  is thought desirable  that the respective arguments in  support of both policies should be set out.&apos;  &apos;  Alternative (A) :-      On behalf of this course,  which is that favoured in the earlier  report of the  Special Committee, para-  graph 11,  it is urged  that, as in  the case  of  manufacture, so also in the case of the civil use of aircraft, the  hope of commercial return is  the most effective stimulus to enterprise, and that the experience of almost all  other enterprises, at least in the United Kingdom, supports this view. ^   In support of private enterprise,  whether entered into by firms or companies, it is argued  that progress  1&apos; much more  rapid than has  been found possible under the machinery  of Government Departments.   The  case of civil  aerial transport seems to be one which calls  for special enterprise  of a peculiarly  open-minded.  character.  The exploration .of the possibilities  of civil aerial transport must be  undertaken in a spirit un-.  trammelled by those methods which have  hitherto been usually associated with Government control.   Rapid!  progress in this new field of transport is essential if this country is to hold its own.      It is urged against  the  exclusive operation of aerial transport services by the State that this system would&apos; , nieah the&apos;t the State&apos; would be the only purchaser of aircraft, and that this would necessarily discourage the&quot;
 desired development of invention  and design, and might involve the  necessity  of  the  State  taking  the business of manufacture as  well as of the use of aircraft into its own hands, a course which, for the reasons given in paragraph 4 above, is to  be deprecated.     .     It is urged further, therefore,  that :-     (a) Firms or companies should without interference  be  allowed to undertake commercial services where         they are willing to  do so.     (b) Firms  or companies which undertake services  desired by the State, but likely in themselves to be         unremunerative, should be assisted by the State to  the extent calculated to provide a  reasonable         return on  the capital invested.   Such assistance might take the form of a guarantee of a minimum         rate of interest on  capital, or even of cash subsidies fixed according to the number of aircraft  and         skilled flyers kept in  continuous  employment.  Precedents  for arrangements of  this  kind are to be         found in cases where the  State has  assisted  steamship  companies by providing, on very easy terms,         part of the capital  cost of ships  constructed  to certain  approved specifications or by  subsidising the         ocean carriage of mails.     Among other methods by which the State could assist private enterprise where such assistance is required, are the following : -                     .     (1.) Charters might be granted to properly organised companies, giving them exclusive running rights for         defined aerial routes, either in the United Kingdom or in the British Dominions and Colonies.     (2) Aerodromes, landing places, meteorological stations and  wireless telegraphic installations which will j         in any case, have to be provided for the naval and military air  force throughout the country, might         be put freely at the disposal of private flyers and commercial undertakings as the roads are put at the         disposal of the travelling public.     (3) The  establishment of high-speed land transport by motor vehicles  and otherwise between aerodromes         in the vicinity of large towns and the  business centres of such towns.     (4) The  State might encourage, by liberal contracts,  the  carriage of mails  and parcels by air, or might        undertake to take up a certain proportion of  the accommodation provided for  such carriage.     (5) Facilities might be  offered for the purchase or hire,  at  low prices, of &quot;aircraft  surplus to  military         requirements at the end of the war.&apos;     (6) A  retaining fee might be paid to such owners of aircraft  as agree to hold them at the  disposal of the         State. Alternative (B) :      On behalf of the State ownership  of civil aerial transport services, either exclusively or in partnership with private enterprises, it is argued :      (a) That since  it is admitted  that State assistance is in  any case necessary for the  development of the        civil use of aircraft  to the extent necessary in the national interest, a system under which all chances        of profit are left to private companies, while the  State undertakes  a great part of the risk,  and the        certainty of expense, is the least  desirable system from the public point of view, and the most exposed        to justifiable criticism.     (b) That if the State must undertake civil aerial transport services  in the national interest, it should at        least undertake or participate in owning and controlling those services which promise to yield a profit        as well as those which do  not.     (c) That such a system  would avoid the possibility of confusion and economic waste through unnecessary        competition between private companies in a field  in which the State protected them  from loss,  and        the  certainty of waste involved in private companies  obtaining Provisional  Orders or  Private Acts of        Parliament, and in  such  directions as the expense of company promotion and the unnecessary multi-        plication of directing staffs.     (d) That State ownership  or participation with private enterprise need not be an unsuccessful  method of        development.     (e) That^while the ownership  by the  State of commercial -enterprises may lie under  the  burden in each        case of justifying its own  necessity, it may fairly be said that in this  instance the  insufficiency or        unsatisfactory  character of the alternatives put forward  furnishes the required proof, and that trans-        port has always been  one  of the  first fields in which  public ownership has shown itself successful, as        witness even in  Great Britain many municipal tramway enterprises.     (f) That, moreover, in this particular instance the matter  is so bound up  with national defence that         any   State would be justified in  going  far beyond its  accustomed  limits  in  commercial   under-        takings in  order to make certain of  creating the equipment of men and material and the sources        of production needed  for its own protection, and that whatever may be the  normally held view of         State ownership, State ownership of aerial transport services including all ancillary equipment, is        forced  upon the community as an unavoidable measure of national self-protection.     8.-The   Special Committee feel  that the questions of principle and policy involved in the two alterna4 tive views  described above raise such  grave issues that it is for  the Main  Committee  itself to judge between^ them; but in any  case it seems necessary that the steps to  be taken to secure the main object  aimed at,namely,  the  provision of the indispensable reservoir of aerial power, should be considered and determinedupon by His Majesty&apos;s Government  at once,  as it will be too  late to  consider  them after the war.  If atthe conclusion of peace direct  naval and military  orders fall  off  very greatly, and no steps have been takenin advance to  create other markets for the manufacturing   industry,   the  manufacturing   industry  willdwindle with great  rapidity and may  well cease altogether  to  exist, except  to the extent necessary  tocomply with  such diminished  naval and  military orders  as the  State may still continue to give.  It cannot

A summary by the Chairman, Mr. White  Smith,  of  the  two  reports of  Special  Committee     3 is attached.                           Brief Summary of First and  Supplementary Reports.                                       Special Committee No. 3.     The questions originally put to  the  Committee  and the  conclusions arrived at  can  be briefly stated as  allows :      What will  be the  position of  the aircraft designing&apos; and constructing  industry  at the conclusion of  he  /ar, and how far can the industry provide  for the requirements of civil aerial transport for aircraft?  It  as immediately found that, so far from there being  any difficulty in  meeting the  requirements for aircraft,  he demands for  civil  aerial transport,  for  some  time, would be quite inadequate  to keep the  industry alive.  t  was considered essential in the interests of  National Defence that the industry should  be  kept  alive.  he Committee, therefore, felt that, in order to keep  the industry in such a-condition as to be  always able to  espond to war emergencies, the services of the industry should continue to be employed for the  design and  evelopment of  naval and  military aircraft,  and for  the carrying out of the  national construction of aircraft  or the future, and this would enable the  design and construction for civil  aerial transport to grow  on a  ound and permanent basis.     In effect, while the Committee have  always felt  complete confidence in the  eventual success of civil and ommercial transport,  yet  they  felt  that, for some time to come, it could not be looked  upon to support the industry.     The other phase of the  question which is dealt with by  the  supplementary report may be summarised hat-     (a) Cost what it may,  this country must lead the world in civil aerial transport.     (b) The State must have  a reservoir  of  aerial power capable of meeting a sudden demand for expansion        of the Naval and Military Air Forces.     Put shortly, we  may say, &quot;It must be  done.&quot;   Approaching  the  question, therefore, from this  point )f  view, it  becomes  evident that,  if civil  aerial transport  is  so necessary  to national interests, every step lossible must be taken by this country and the Empire to foster the rapid development of this form of aerial power,  and by it the power of production in this country.     The development  of civil aerial transport  to the extent outlined  in  the preceding  paragraph  cannot, in the opinion of the Special Committee, be  brought  about without  some State action.     The State may :-     (a) Give its assistance in one or  more of many possible forms to private enterprise; or     (b) May itself own  and operate, or participate in the ownership and operation  of, aerial transport under-        takings.     The arguments in  support of each of  these policies have been very fully discussed by  the Committee, and are set out  fully in their Report.  It is desired that the members of the  Main Committee shall consider them in full as set out,  and for this reason no resume has been attempted.     In conclusion, the  Special Committee feel that the questions of principle and  policy  involved in  the two alternative views described above raise such grave issues that it  is for the  Main Committee  itself to  judge between them ;  but in any case, it seems necessary that the steps to be  taken to secure the main object aimed at, namely, the  provision of the indispensable reservoir of aerial power, should be considered and  determined  eon by His Majesty&apos;s Government  at once, as it will be. too late to consider  them after the War.   If at pb  conclusion of peace direct  naval  and  military  orders fall off very greatly, and  no steps have  been  taken n advance to create  other  markets for the manufacturing industry, the manufacturing industry will  dwindle frith great rapidity and may well cease altogether to  exist,  except to  the  extent necessary  to  comply  with puch  diminished naval  and military  orders as the State may still  continue to give. It  cannot last  without orders while the State is considering what steps can  be taken to develop the commercial  use  of aircraft a process that is  likely to occupy some time.

Report of  Special Committee  No.  4.*    This Special Committee  were appointed to advise the  Main  Committee upon the problems of labouland of the  technical education of artisans and mechanics,  male and  female,  arising in the development ofcivil aeronautics with special reference to :      (1)  The possibility  of setting up  a  model  type of industrial organisation applicable either to the whole        of  labour employed in aircraft manufacture and in aerial transport, or,  if necessary,  to separate        groups of labour so employed, for the purpose of avoiding the friction and conflicts which characterise        present labour disputes.    (2)  Problems connected with dilution of labour, and the rates of and methods  of calculating wages.    (3)  The.necessity for some scheme of technical education applicable to artisans and mechanics, male  and        female, employed in  aircraft  manufacture and in aerial transport, and the extent  (if  any) to which        such  a scheme should be dependent upon  State or  municipal  assistance.  &apos;  (4)  The necessity for an administrative  body or bodies  to control  the entire industry of aeronautics with        regard to labour and labour conditions,  including technical education, as above mentioned, and  the        question of the representation on such body or bodies of the  State, the employer and labour, and the        limits within which the control of such a body should be exercised.     1. The Special Committee have given their most careful consideration to the questions submitted to them by the Main Committee.  Before proceeding to deal with detailed points arising on its terms of reference, the Special Committee have thought it advisable to submit at the outset of their report the conclusions they have arrived at in relation to the four headings to which special attention is  directed in those terms  of reference. These conclusions are submitted in the form of answers to the specific questions raised in these four headings :-     (1) (a)  There is no possibility of setting up a model type of  industrial organisation  applicable  either to        the  whole  of the  labour  employed  in  aircraft  manufacture or  to  separate  groups of  labour         so  employed.    At  the  same  time  the  Committee think  that  the suggestions contained in         the  Report  of  the   Sub-Committee  of  the   Reconstruction   Committee  on   the  relations         between employers and employed (generally known as the Whitley Report) are no less applicable to         the relations of labour and  capital in  aircraft manufacture than to labour employed in the whole         group  of engineering industries.         (b) The Committee come to the same conclusion with regard to labour or groups of labour  employed         in aerial transport services; but they would suggest that,  since  at present there does not  exist an         organised body of labour employed  in aerial transport services, such  a  body might offer a  specially         favourable field for the realisation of the ideals outlined in the Whitley Report.     (2) There  are  no special problems  connected with the dilution of  labour and the rates and methods of         calculating  wages peculiar to labour employed in  aircraft manufacture or in aerial transport services         as such.     (3) There  is no necessity for any  special  scheme of technical  education applicable  to artisans  and        mechanics,  male  and female, employed in aircraft manufacture and in aerial transport  services, as        distinct from similar persons employed in other occupations;  but the  Committee  think  that any        schemes of  technical education of persons employed  in the engineering industries generally are par-        ticularly suitable to persons employed  in the aircraft industry, and that such schemes should be so        arranged as to include the technical education of  the latter class.     (4) There  is no necessity  for  the  creation of  an administrative body or  bodies to control the entire in-        dustry of aeronautics with regard to labour and labour  conditions other than the  machinery  of the        Joint  Standing Industrial Councils  recommended in the Whitley Report.     In  submitting these conclusions  to the Main  Committee, the Special Committee have divided  the main problem  referred to it into two general headings, viz., the  problem of labour in aircraft  manufacture andthe problem of  labour in aerial transport services.  The grounds  upon which these conclusions are based are contained in the following paragraphs of this report.    2. In this body of labour there were employed in 1916 about 100,000 persons, of whom about 25,000were  women or boys  under military  age.   These numbers are constantly increasing.   They  are,  indeed,growing so rapidly  with the growing demand of the Government for aircraft which demand has of late beensuddenly and very  greatly expanded-that reliable statistics are very difficult to obtain.  Even if they couldbe  obtained they   would  at  once  become  out  of  date,  as   fresh  firms  come  into  operation  asaircraft constructors.    So  long  as   the   war  lasts,  there  is  likely  to be  continuous  increase  in thenumber of  persons employed.   The  construction  of  aircraft  engines  is a  specialised  and  highly  im-portant  section  of engineering,   and it  necessitates  the  employment of  a  considerable   number of skilled  mechanics fitters, turners,  coppersmiths,  sheet-metal workers,  etc. as  well as a  due proportiij!of semi-skilled and unskilled workers.   The construction of aircraft, in which  woodwork is  at  present theprincipal factor, involves  the employment  of woodworkers of varying degrees of skill, and to meet the demandfor additional labour brought about by  the war, large  numbers of woodworkers have been  drawn  into the in-dustry from other trades, including  the building trade, furniture trade, coachbuilding,  etc.  In both sectionsof the industry (engines and aircraft) there has been  not only &quot; dilution,&quot; but also the  introduction of femalelabour to new work prior to the war.  The employmen of women has steadily extended.   ,Labour in  the Industry.* Mr. H. G. Wells, the Chairman of this Special Committee, appends a Minority Report which is set out at the end of this report.
    5. The Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee on  relations  between employers and  employed,inder the Chairmanship of Mr.  J.  H. Whitley,  M.P.. is  the body most directly concerned with the post-rar problem of the relations between labour and  capital, and has issued an Interim Report on Joint Standingindustrial Councils,  which has been published  as  a Parliamentary Paper  CD. 8606.   The  Committeesppointed to consider the position after the war of the great groups of industries classified under the head ofugineering have been content to leave this aspect of their problem to be dealt with by Mr. Whitley&apos;s Com-committee, and we feel that  a Committee dealing with the as yet.comparatively small aircraft industry, especi-lly as it depends so largely on the engineering industry, may  well follow their example.  The rapid expan-iion of the manufacture of aeroplanes and airships  has, however,  attracted  to the aircraft industry a largeind miscellaneous  body of labour whose  elements wrere  formerly   connected  with  trades  other  than  theengineering trade, and whose  members belong to  Trade Unions concerned with entirely different trades, e.g.,the  various branches of the building trade,  coach  and carriage  building and  upholstering,  cabinet making,organ building, etc.  The  majority of these workpeople are woodworkers, and while many of them  are skilledin   en, possessing the  degree  of skill necessary for their previous occupations, the skill called for by the air-  craft industry is not  a highly specialised skill, winch cannot be  used in other  woodworking industries.  It  may be that many of those who, prior to the special demand of the Government for aircraft for war purposes.   ere employed  in other industries, will return to those industries if the end of the war brings with it a great  diminution in the  demand  for aircraft; it must, however, be asumed that the aircraft industry will exist in the  future to a very much greater extent than was the case before the war, and it follows, therefore, that the  abour problems connected with the industry will be influenced by the &quot; new blood &quot; which has come into the  industry, and by  the forces  with which that &quot; new blood &quot;  is connected.   The possibility must  not be over-  ooked that in the future wood may be more or less replaced by metal in the manufacture of aircraft, and that  consequently the total number of woodworkers employed in the industry will be uncertain.      6. It is  impossible to  forecast  at present the special labour problems  that are  likely  to arise in the  industry, and it is  useless,  therefore, to attempt any detailed suggestions as to how  they may be dealt  with  when they do arise.   But there are one or two features which it  may  be worth while briefly to  mention, as  they will serve  to show in  what respects the industry differs from the ordinary well-defined industry and to  indicate the type of  problem with which those who are concerned in  the industry may be faced.      7. At the moment the aircraft industry is more closely allied to the  engineering trade than to other  trades, and  the principal firms are members of the Engineering Employers&apos;  Associations in the districts in  which  their  respective  works are situated;  the  industry is,  therefore,  linked on the employers&apos; side,  with  the  organisation of the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation,  while the skilled engineers are members of the  various skilled Trade Unions connected with the engineering trade.   On the Other hand, the Trade Unions  to which the bulk  of  the woodworkers belong (and they are numerically a  very large  proportion of the in-  tlustry) are not primarily connected with the engineering trade; they  are connected  with trades  such as the  building trades,  and they have the  associations and traditions  of  those trades.  The third class (and it is an  important one) consists of  the women, who are employed on the engineering side, the woodworking side, and  as fabric hands,  and who; in  so far as  they are organised, are members of the National Federation of Women  Workers or  of one of the general workers&apos; unions who specialise in female  members.  These three groups of  trade unions have  not hitherto been, identified with a single industry,  and their traditional interests may  tend  to be divergent.  The position is  one that calls for special consideration on the part of the employers, and it  may, no doubt, be assumed that  it is already receiving such  consideration  at the hands  of  the employers&apos;  organisations.  We feel that  it is for those organisations,  in  conjunction with  the  labour organisations,  to  consider for  themselves how the special circumstances may best be met and that it would not be helpful for  this  Committee to  attempt to advise them.      8.  How  far the  various  labour organisations within the aircraft industry may be able to reconcile their  interests, it  is impracticable  nowr to say.   Some of the  woodworkers,  themselves members  of  the various  woodworking unions, have formed  woodworkers&apos; aircraft committees in various  centres, and if  it should  happen that the women&apos;s organisations are  able  to join with such Committees, there would exist  a fairlyf  fell-defined  &quot; labour  side &quot;  to the industry, consisting, on the one hand, of the engineering section (repre-  *nted  as stated above, by the skilled  Engineering Trade Unions), and on the other hand of the woodworking  and  fabric sections (represented by some joint body of woodworkers&apos;unions, plus the women&apos;s organisations).     9.  Having regard to the special development and rapid growth  of  the industry, and to the  somewhat  peculiar character  of  the trade (being  linked with but  not  entirely  covered - by &quot;the engineering  trade as  ordinarily understood), there  may be difficulties in adopting directly for  the aircraft industry the scheme of  Joint Councils recommended  by the Whitley Committee.  The consideration and solution of these difficulties  nre,  in our view, matters  for the parties directly concerned rather than for this Committee, and we think      3.  The Committee discussed the possibility of dealing with the industry as a distinct  economic organisa-  lon, and dismissed this as entirely impracticable.   Mainly, the  industry is a  branch of engineering of  a  Similar nature to the automobile industry.   It seems impossible to sub-divide the engineering industry any-  Ihere by vertical lines of division.  Skilled and semi-skilled labour flows to and fro, in its own trade, between    e department  of engineering work and another.   Engineering  labour organisation and engineering  techni-     education, the Committee are persuaded, are each whole and indivisible problems.      4.  The Committee  find that under  the Reconstruction Committee there have been appointed Sub-Com- 0ljuittees on relations between employers and employed, and on War Pledges, while Committees have also been   ^pointed on the engineering trades; on  the  textile  trades; on the teaching of science; and on juvenile educa-)lJion in relation  to employment  after the War.   Of the bodies above mentioned, the Committee are informedtefhat the terms of reference  to the War  Pledges Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee  merelysjleal with the  legal steps that would be necessary on the assumption that all the pledges  given  to organised   labour during the war  in connection with dilution, the employment of women, and the like, are to be carried    t in their entirety, a matter which is not directly the concern  of  this Committee.    The  Committee on  ftcienee in the Educational System are as yet only at an early stage of their enquiry.  The Report  of the  fjCommittee on  Juvenile Education in relation to employment  after the war has been published as a  Parlia-   nentary Paper (Cd. 8512), and  forms the  basis of the Education Bill.
 our participation in the question should begin and end with the recommendation  that  in the consideration of the subject the parties should have in mind the principles underlying  the  Whitley  Report,  and  should approach the problems in the spirit indicated in that Report.                                        Labour hi the Air Service.     10.  The Committee have also given their careful attention to the question of the labour connected with ai- routes and services.   Exact figures of the labour likely to be so employed cannot be hoped for at the prese time, but it seems improbable that the civil use of aircraft can immediately absorb  any appreciable fraction of the trained personnel, which the conclusion of  peace may leave surplus to  the  requirements  of  the naval and military air Services.                             Education  of Labour in the Service and Industry.     11.  The Committee are of opinion that the technical education of aircraft workers cannot be  conveniently treated as a special subject; like the labour itself, the educational work is divided between the  engineering and the woodworkers&apos; trades, and the Committee see no advantage in adding anything here to the counsels of other bodies well able to deal with those matters, such  as the recently formed central  organisation for the correla- tion and improvement of engineering training.                                                   *A.

Minority Report by  the  Chairman.     In presenting the findings of Special Committee No. 4, the  Chairman would like to add a few dissentient observations.     While the engineering employers have been fully and  ably  represented  on the Committee, the ideals of labour have had  little  or no expression, and there has been, he thinks, a  disposition to exaggerate the im- poitance of the welfare of the industry in relation to the destinies of the Empire.  This is particularly marii- lost, it! the shortness and quality of the paragraph relating to the Air Services. An  excess of tenderness  for the no doubt deserving private groups that may wish  to undertake &quot; air&quot; transport at the end of the war, and an excess of financial timidity, seem to have  blinded the Special Committee to  the supreme importance to the Empire of the immediate establishment of  Imperial Air  Services at  the Peace.   For such an end the business  adventurer in air exploitation should be as willing  to face stress and ruin as our common soldiers have been to face toil and death in  Flanders.     The British Islands are small islands, and our people numerically a  little -people;  their  only  claim to world importance  depends on their courage and enterprise,  and  a people  who will not  stand up  to  the necessity  of an Air Service planned on a world scale and  taking over thousands of aeroplanes and thousands of men from the very onset of peace, has no business to pretend to anything more than a second-rate position in the  world. We cannot be both  Imperial and mean.   For this reason the  Chairman dissents  altogether from the  timid findings of the Special Committee set out in paragraph 10.     Assuming, as he does, that a boldly conceived world air service is essential to  our  Imperial  pretensions, the Chairman deplores the narrowness of outlook that has debarred  the  Special Committee from seizing  its opportunity to plan an Air Service not only great  in scale but great in spirit.  This Civil Air Service afforded the possibility of a new departure in the organisation of our workers, and the Chairman of Special Committee No. 4 appeals from that Special Committee to the Main Civil Aerial Transport Committee to consider, before it  is too late, the possibility of creating from the  first a great service with  a common spirit.  Here, at least, we could anticipate and avoid the clash of direction and labour.   It would  be  possible to associate  from  the first the entire personnel of the service with the management.   It would  be practicable and  in accordance with the more  constructive ideas that now animate labour circles  to give  everyone employed,  from  trafficmanager and pilot to groundmen, a representation upon the general management.  What is proposed here isno mere &quot; labour &quot; delegate.   What is desirable is a state of affairs in which everyone in the management will feel concerned in the mental  and bodily  welfare of the personnel, and in  which  every worker,  whether onthe directive or the operative side,  will consider himself concerned for the efficiency of the Service.  Everyone in the  Service could have a voice in the appointment of  these   suggested  representative  members  of  themanagement. There are two  chief interests in every service of public utility ; the first of these is the general community, for which, logically, a  portion of the management  appointed  by  the  State  should  stand;  the second is  the Service itself, for which stand the representatives of the directing staff and of all engaged in the Service.   In the  case  of a State-owned Service, these two elements would constitute the entire management;in  the case where private enterprise was a factor it would also provide a third  factor in the general manage-ment.  Suppose.,  for example, an aerial transport company, fostered by the State for reasons of policy by thegrant of  monopoly  running rights over given routes, or by a guarantee of a minimum rate of interest on itscapital.   It might be managed by a Board of Directors, some  appointed by  the shareholders in the ordinari way, some by the State, to watch its  interests, and some  by the employees.  If it  be admitted that such  :Jarrangement would tend to prevent disputes  and  strikes,  it is probable that it would commend  itself  to the State.  The State would have a direct interest in the smooth  and  continuous working of the  Service.  Thisinterest would be presupposed in the grant of monopoly running rights or in a guarantee of a minimum rateof  interest on capital, and the  State might even make the adoption of an arrangement of the nature suggested a condition  of its grant of such privileges.  But these possibilities have been disregarded by the Special Com-     *  Mr. Berriman signs this report subject to the deletion of the following words in paragraph 11, &quot; like the labour itself,  the educational work is divided between the engineering and the woodworkers&apos; trades.&quot;
II1niittee as a whole.  Many of its members seem to have been  obsessed by a conception of private enterpriseworking its way slowly to an efficient air service at  the  expense of casually  employed workers.  From  thefirst the workers under such conditions will be  forced into the self-protective and hostile attitude too charac-Jeristic of British labour.  Unhappily for the British employer it is incredible  that  Berlin, America, or  theworld generally will wait while these time-honoured British methods feel their way through a cycle of labour $ustments to a minimum of efficiency in a maximum of time.  The Air Service of the world will inevitably   taken out  of British hands if this is our way to Civil Air Transport.   Unless we are prepared to plannow for a great public air service, generously served by generously treated workers, it is childish to anticipate any great future for our Empire in the air.    The Chairman also regrets that the Special Committee has been unable, as a whole, to make any recom-rnendations with regard to the employment of discharged sailors and soldiers.  There are at present numerousopportunities  for the utilisation of partially disabled sailors and soldiers  in  the aeroplane factory, and  thereis no conclusive reason why much of that employment should not continue after the war, due regard  beingshoAvn to Trade Union interests.  There are many occupations,  both  in the  aeroplane  factory and in  the aerodrome,  where  physical disabilities of a not  too serious nature do not debar men from useful work in somecases  after  a preliminary period  of  practical training.  Splicing  of wire cable,  for instance, and  acetylenewelding are  sedentary  jobs requiring no great  exertion, which can be done by any man possessing the full use of his hands,  arms, and  eyesight. These jobs are successfully undertaken by women, but at the presenttime  there  are probably not  enough women trained to meet  the demand.   Many other  jobs  could  also beundertaken  by men of  this kind, such as those of storekeepers, record and  issuing clerks, watchmen,  care-takers, and  works&apos; police: also those of gatekeepers and turnstile keepers at aerodromes, and of groundmenfor keeping aerodromes in proper condition.  The intermittent nature  of aerodrome  employment makes  itpeculiarly suitable  for men whose injuries, while leaving them capable of occasional  activity, unfit them for continued hard work.   And these remarks apply not only to those engaged in actual labour, but also to  thosewho may be engaged in the management of these various  grounds.  It is to be  noted  that the Ministry ofMunitions Dilution Department is giving attention to this  particular problem,  and will probably accumulatesome valuable experiences.                            %e.    Generally, these men will be in receipt of  pensions, and  there seems to be  no  justification for the ruleunderstood to prevail in the  case  of men directly employed by Government, under which a man in receipt ofa pension is not allowed to draw in the shape of pension and wages combined more than the  rate of wagesordinarily given for work of the nature of that  in which he is employed.   It would appear that a man. inreceipt of a pension of  25s.  a week, if employed by  Government on a job for which the ordinary rate of wageswas 25s. a week or over, would draw no pension at al  while  so  employed; or, if employed  by Governmenton  a job for which the ordinary rate of wages  was less than 25s.  a week,  would draw only so much of his pension  as would bring his total weekly emoluments up to 25s. This rule must, it would seem, put a premiufnon  idleness  and upon taking service  with a private  employer rather than with the Government,  for in  theservice of a  private employer a pensioner would draw his wages and his full pension as well.  It is certainlyworth while to draw attention to this point, although it does not arise exclusively in connection with the air-craft industry.    It is possible that a difficulty may arise in connection with the employment of disabled sailors and soldiersif their injuries are such as to incapacitate them from earning Trade Union rates of wages,  owing to objec-f-ions on the part of the Unions to their being employed at lower rates;  but such objections  ought not  to be insuperable,  provided none  but ex-sailors and   ex-soldiers  in  receipt of  pensions are employed at less thanUnion rates, and provided that they  are so employed that the  wages which they can fairly earn, when  addedto  their pensions, makes up a total  emolument  equal to or greater (by  an agreed upon  amount)  than theUnion rate  of wages, and that their employment is not more  profitable to the employer.  This  is  a  questionupon which a speedy agreement with the Trade Unions is most  desirable.  What is needed is  some generaldecision upon the  rules under which disabled  soldiers shall be employed. It may be suggested that the TradeUnions should themselves propose a classification of disabled men, and should  suggest a minimum wage foreach class on the  assumption that employment will not diminish the amount of the man&apos;s pension.    There is  a third matter in which the Special Committee has failed to rise to its opportunities,  and thatis in  connection with the possibilities of developing an  imaginative   solidarity  in   the  Air  Industry and services.  To be frank  upon a matter of public importance too  urgent for euphemisms, the bulk of employers in  Great Britain appear to  be men differing rather in tenacity of character that  in breadth of outlook fromthe workmen they  employ, and they do not seem to understand that elementary  psychology  of modern in-dustrial employment.   They do not  see their duty and opportunity of mental  leadership; they decline flatlyto  be  the captains instead  of the exploiters of industry.   The modern  worker  reads, thinks,  and has  hisimagination stimulated  in a hundred ways that did not exist  in the dull round of the mid-Victorian wages-serfs&apos;  experience.   In  addition, we  shall presently be seeing the return to industry of great numbers ofworkers whose minds have been further  quickened by the  war.  It is  the interest, therefore, quite  as  muchas  the public duty  of the modern  employer to do his utmost to give the  worker a living interest in his  work,to  make him. or her, feel, not a driven &quot;hand,&quot; but a person sharing the effort and triumphs of the industry.The alternative is  that  disastrous and dangerous modern product, the professed  &quot;rebel.&quot;  Something  morethan merely technical training is wanted for a proper industrial mentality; imaginative training is about equally important.   Among other devices that should be  employed in the organisation  of a modern  industry, is a&quot; trade &quot; paper brought within the reach and attention of every worker;  a paper to sustain the  living interestof  the worker in his industry, to facilitate  understandings,  stimulate ambition,  and  keep him  or her  alive.b  the case of the Air Industry and Service,  a weekly illustrated paper devoted to  the enterprise  of, and^povations in, aeronautics, to the illustration of model works at home and  abroad, to the discussion of new methods and  trade problems, and to the impartial  discussion, by means of correspondence, of current labour difficulties, is required.   The free  and full development of  the latter feature is highly important.  Every com-petent authority upon labour troubles agrees that the essence of these troubles is suspicion, and the way out ofa suspicious situation is for management and worker alike to cultivate outspokenness and &quot; play with the cardson  the table.&quot; With this proposed trade paper  a method of tuition by correspondence and self-education  couldl)e  very easily combined.  What is here suggested is not a paper merely for the  discussion  of &quot; shop &quot; ;  itsaim and effect would be to lift every worker  in both branches of this  field out of the little rut of merelymechanical  participation into an  understanding  of the story of this new and wonderful field of human effort.
    This much the Chairman of  Special Committee No. 4 begs to add  to the report that he  here presentsHis differences from his colleagues are probably all to be traced in  the end to a difference in their and hisinterpretation of the aim  of the  Civil Aerial Transport  Committee.    Several  of the  recommendationsembodied in this minority  report have indeed been set aside by Special Committee No. 4 only because the;are judged to be beyond the scope of that Special &quot;Committee.  But the  Civil Aerial Transport Committee a;a whole, he holds, is a Committee not to make decisions,  but projects, and a freedom and  boldness  wittregard to the terms of reference and to new ideas are more in the spirit of its creation than a careful restriction  within its literal terms of reference.  He  believes that,what the Air Board wants from the Civil AeriaTransport Committee is not discreet answers to set questions, but comprehensive plans and a  general reviewof all possibilities (of which labour troubles are not the  least)  affecting the peace  future of.the  Empirethe Air.                                                                                        .,                                                                                  H. G. Wells.T al 1 jfiNovember  10th,  1917.)Aeronautics presents  as  marvellous and romantic a story  as  any in the human  record.  That  wonder amromance are in themselves a force which, to put it at the lowest level, it is unbusinesslike to waste.   Bumany employers seem unable to appreciate the role of such  a stimulant.   Indeed, some  of  them  seem tregard the proposal with terror, as an  unjustifiable illumination of the privacies  of business enterprise.    How the paper could be produced and supplied is a question  of  some  delicacy.   It might,  perhaps, jlBproduced by a  special joint  committee, representing the directors and labour of  the  industry, maintainiP.by a capitation tax upon the employer of a Id. or so per head of the number of workers employed,  and dis-tributed gratis at pay. day.  But such official papers are apt  .to  lack  the * spirit .and interest of periodicalsconducted upon more normal lines.  Probably it would.be less expensive to  the  employer  and altogethermore successful to select  one or several of  the  existing &quot;Air&quot; weeklies and,  subject to their  agreement to insert  certain definite features, to purchase and distribute in large quantities.  It would not be difficultto arrange for  an added page  edited by  a special joint committee  of directors and labour  on the modelthe added page  in the ordinary parochial magazine.  A wholesome competitive element would be introduced by allowing each  worker to choose which of the several selected papers should  be given him.    Another important factor in the consolidation of the Aeroplane Industry and Service which Special Com-mittee No. 4 has  preferred to ignore, is the use of the Cinema by the organised  industry.  This could bemade of the utmost service in  attracting young people to the industry, and keeping the general public in-telligently sympathetic with its progress.  It  is as much the business of modern industry to  cheer, interest,educate, and invigorate its workers, and keep the public in touch with its activities as it is to get machinerjof the highest efficiency.  A business  that bores or exasperates  its  employees  or  the  public  is a  badly-organised  business.
71102                   APPENDIX   VII.Interim and  Final  Reports  of Special  Committee No.  5.1*INTERIM  REPORT.   The Committee were asked to advise upon  research and the special scientific education of expert designers,ngineers, and pilots, with  special reference to certain details of those lines of enquiry which are dealt witheriatim in the present  report.  The two subjects of research and education form convenient main divisionss a basis for their report, and the Committee propose to take them into consideration in the order named.                                          I.  EE SEARCH.   1.  In classifying  the different headings into which  the general  subject of research most convenientlyalls, the Special Committee have adopted the  following division   (a) Invention in regard to aeronautics.   (b) Experiments in regard to aeronautics.   (c) Research in regard to meteorology.   (d) Accident investigation.mbein-!St,sriy-its,hisansley asithricriaiew in   2. In so far  as the headings (a)  and (b) are viewed in the light of any scheme for the encouragement and development of research, they are so closely connected that the Committee find it  convenient to dealtvith them together.   The development of aeronautical  science has been very rapid, both before and  during the war,  and,iwing to  the necessity  in  military and naval interests of keeping inventions and  data connected  with this,cience secret, the full publication of results in the interests  of the aircraft industry has been  impossible.During  the  years preceding  the  war the Secretary of the Advisory  Committee on Aeronautics  preparedbstracts of foreign scientific  literature, which were published  as  an appendix  to  the yearly  reports of theCommittee.   These reports only  contained  the results of such scientific work as had then been  published as distinct from work accomplished which far exceeded that made public at any rate in Great Britain), butven these were not available to  the ordinary investigator in a comprehensive or convenient form.  The sameemark  probably applies to similar  reports from scientific institutions on the Continent.   There now exists vast body  of information which when made available in some  well ordered form after  the  war will be ofital importance to the  development of aeronautical science.  The chief mines of such information are :    A. The Advisory Committee on Aeronautics.   B.  The Technical Offices of the Air Board.   C. The  National Physical Laboratory and the Royal Aircraft  Factory.   3. The Committee hold a strong view that as a basis for  research this information must be collected andrranged.  This will involve  considerable labour, which the Committee think can be divided as follows :-   (a)  The compilation of a bibliography and of  short abstracts  of the principal papers;   (b)  the  publication  of  an aeronautical treatise embodying  a  full account and critical  analysis of the in-       formation available;   (c)  the  publication  of  reliable text books, based on such well verified conclusions as can be drawn  from       this information.  these the most important is the preparation of the treatise mentioned  in  (b),  and the Committee  refer th approval to a report on  this question  by Sir R. T. Glazebrook and Professor Petavel, which is attached  Appendix A to this report.  They draw attention  to the  outline scheme  setting  out  the  different Appendix Jctions of aeronautical  science which  such a treatise should cover.                                        A&apos; p&apos; 77   4. It  seems clear to the  Committee  that the work comprised in headings (a)  and (b) in the  preceding uagraph should be undertaken by  the same organisation, and the question  arises   as to  the  constitution, nance, and control of  such an organisation.  The results of  the  work  so undertaken  would  benefit the overnment, the  industry, and the public, but  the most direct benefit would be that to the Government. ie sources of information are under Government control; but  the information itself is in such a scattered id disjointed form, as to be only  understandable by those who have in fact  followed the  details  step by step, ithin the Government  offices, and only  with considerable difficulty even by them.  Accordingly,  the Com- ittee recommend the  institution of  a bureau for collecting  and disseminating aero-technical knowledge in ie interests of civil  aeronautics, which, pending the establishment  of a Research  Association  for  the dustry,  should be financed  by a grant  from the Department of Scientific and  Industrial Research.   The ueau might, perhaps, be attached during  the war period to the National Physical Laboratory, and could  staffed by an expert  investigator with  assistance and the necessary  clerks.  An estimate has been received iat a sum of, say,  2,000 per annum would  be sufficient to meet  the cost, both of  the bureau and of oducing the treatise referred to in (b) in the preceding  paragraph.   The  initiation of  this work  is so im-  rtant, and the process of collecting  the  existing data must necesarily be so slow that the Committee think at the bureau should be set up without delay during the  war, accepting the view that  it will  probably be cessary to treat the information prepared as confidential, but in the hope that secret information will in S^course become available for  the  British investigator.   5. As to the publication of reliable  text  books  mentioned in paragraph 3 (b) above, the Committee doubt lether this will require Government intervention.  The  production of such text books might, no  doubt, be It to private  enterprise, but  their initiation is of  great importance and urgency, and there is danger that, &quot;the absence of an appropriate grant  from the Government, a very long time would elapse before such  a  nature would offer sufficient inducement to any private individual to make the effort to start it.   6. The foregoing  paragraphs deal  with the materials upon  which  a certain part of aeronautical research   be based.   There remain to be considered the problems of finding what machinery  or organisation shall  ry on (a) tests and investigation of finished products-aircraft,  engines,  and  sundries,  and  (b) furthera1
        research, including physical, model and lull scale.  The Committee desire to emphasise  the close association        of these two different functions of the research organisation, because the proper carrying out  of any tests ol        performance under (a) essentially involves the use of a skilled  staff such  as could well be drawn from a body        engaged in  research of the kind  indicated in (b).  The important question of the certification of the routine        products  of manufacture as distinct from experimental construction,  though closely related  to the problem        submitted to the Special Committee, falls outside their terms of reference.                               (             7.  The Committee appreciate the fact that much useful research work is being  done, and will be done        in Universities and Technical  Institutes, and they note with satisfaction  the  recent  announcement that  the        Research Department have made a grant to Professor Bryan,  F.R.S., of the University College of  Nqr$        Wales, to enable him for a whole session  to carry on aeronautical research.  At the same time, they feel that,        since it is desirable to maintain in practice the close connection between research and test work, the institu-        tion, for the benefit of all constructors, of a  Central Research  Laboratory is desirable.  Connected with such        a Laboratory the Committee recommend the establishment of  a  Central  Aircraft Test Ground and Testing        Establishment.   The  aim  of the former would be to form a  centre of  study of aeronautical problems, and        the aim of  the latter to provide  reliable  and impartial  test results to the constructors and designers of  the        country, whether on  their experimental or on-their routine  production.    The  Committee think that it is        essential that the Laboratory and the Test Ground should be  combined  in one establishment.             8.  At present the  Society of  British Aircraft Constructors  are  considering the formation  of  a Researcl        Association  in conformity with  the rules laid down by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.        The proposal to form such an Association has already been approved in principle.   No details of organisation        control, or finance are as yet available; but it is assumed that it will be in receipt of funds contributed by  tht        firms who are members of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors, many of whose individual engineer!        will  also  be represented as  members of  the Aeronautical Society on the Board of the Research  Association             9.  It is thought  desirable  that the Laboratory  and the  Testing Establishment  should  be in one place.        and the following scheme represents what the Committee are prepared to recommend in the light of theii        present information :                I.  A  Bureau for the preparation of the  bibliography and treatise proposed above (paragraphs 3 and  I                  to be established at the National Physical Laboratory under the control of, and paid for from Stall                  funds made available for that Institution.              II. A  Central Research Laboratory (see above paragraph  7).             III. A  Central Aircraft Test Ground and Testing Establishment  (see above paragraph 7).        If 11. and HI. should be, like  I., under the  control of the National  Physical  Laboratory, they should  tin        doubtedly be  established at some place where  there is ample  room for a ground of adequate  size,  if  no        on an existing aerodrome, near a centre of scientific effort, such  as London.  This  is of the essence of  tb        matter, and makes it impossible  to recommend that the establishment  should be  at Teddington,  where suffi        cient space is not available.  The funds required for II. and III. should be provided by grants from the Depart        ment of Scientific and Industrial Research and by contributions  from  the industry,  which, for this  purpose        means the Research x\association  mentioned above in paragraph 8.    Suitable  fees   might  be  charged   t        individuals for tests carried out on their  behalf  by  the Testing  Establishment.   The  results of such test        could and should be treated as confidential whenever the individuals on whose behalf they are made desire it,            10. The importance of meteorology in the development of aeronautics can hardly  be over-estimated.  Th        Committee  were entrusted only  with the question  of  research in regard to meteorology, and  they undei        stand that the question of the  dissemination of meteorological  information after it has been obtained, is bein        dealt with by Special  Committee No: 2.  The problems  of meteorological research have been dealt with iAppendices memoranda by Major  Lyons and Sir Napier Shaw, which are appended  to  this report  (Appendices B anB &amp; C   C).   In these memoranda the  Committee desire to draw attention to the following points :--        &apos;  &apos;   (a) The necessity for a closer study of atmospheric conditions at great heights.             (b) The investigation of the phenomena of mist  and fog and abnormal air currents in special localities.            (c) The necessity  for an organised scheme for improving  the supply of  information  from the  meteon                 loffist to the flyer and  vice versa.             (d) The desirability of preparing meteorological information in  a form most suitable for aviators froi                 the existing  material, not only for  the  United Kingdom, but for so much of Europe and for sue                 air routes as may be selected.             11. In  the case of meteorology, it is practically  impossible  to divide research proper from the dissemin        tion of the results of that research.  For this reason the Committee approve of the conclusions drawn by S        Napier Shaw in  paragraphs 2  and 3 of his memorandum (Appendix C), and they strongly support the othi        recommendations contained in the two memoranda  (Appendices B and C),  which  may be  summarised!        follows :              (a) The necessity for increased facilities for aeronautical research at  the Meteorological Office.             (b) The necessity  for  local  meteorological establishments at appropriate terminal aerodromes, connect;                 by telephone with the Meteorological Office and with each other.             (c) The necessity for instituting meteorological research  centres   in  connection with  Universities ai                 other centres  of education.             (d) The necessity for the  issue of suitable handbooks for the purpose of instructing flyers  in rheteorolog            12. In connection with the proposed local meteorological establishments mentioned in (b) of the precedii        paragraph, the Committee recommend that the practical suggestions in matters  of  detail put forward (, appendix letter  from  Sir  Napier Shaw  dated  August  25th, 1917  (Appendix D)  should be adopted.    Army  MeteorjjD-f     logical Stations now established  in France, and  a considerable number of Naval Meteorological  Stations W        the United  Kingdom will  serve as models for these local  stations, and the  experience gained in the formffl        will be available.  Recommendations (a)  and (d) of the preceding paragraph should be pressed upon til        attention of H.M. Government, and recommendation (c) should be brought to the notice of the  UniversitifB        and leading Technical Institutions of the United Kingdom            13. The foregoing recommendations will render necessary  an increase in  the staff of the  Meteorologies                                             t Not  printed, see  note on p. 2.
73103Office, particularly as the Committee is disposed to thiuk  that  all  the local  meteorological  establishmentsshould be under the direct control of that Office.  In the case of State owned aerodromes the matter is clearlycapable of easy arrangement between the Meteorological Office and the Department controlling the aerodrome,while in private aerodromes the advantages to  the owner of  the  presence of a meteorological station are soobvious that it is not to be  supposed tliat he would raise any objection.  Any expense consequent  upon thefpvision of these meteorological stations should fall  upon Government funds,  and the working out  of the  cessary details should be left in the hands of the Meteorological  Office.  The Committee further desire toemphasise the necessity of ensuring co-operation between  the  Meteorological  Office and  the  DominionAuthorities responsible for the organisation of meteorological stations in the Dominions.   14. It will be observed that the Committee have not dealt  with the problem of accident investigation men-tioned in paragraph 1 of this report.  They are proposing to consider  this question with the  assistance of amemorandum thereon by Mr. Harper  and Captain Hucks.  The Committee&apos;s views on this point and  their conclusions as to the special scientific education of expert  designers, engineers,  and pilots,  particularly inrelation to navigation,  will  be included  in a second report to  the  Main Committee.

November 17,1917.                                         FINAL  REPORT.    As stated in the  final paragraph of their  interim report, the  Special Committee propose to deal  in thepresent report with the subject of accident investigation, being the remaining heading of the branch of theirenquiry relating to Research, and with the second branch of their enquiry, viz., Special  scientific education of expert engineers, designers, and pilots.           -  -                                      I.  RESEARCH (continued).    15.  The investigation of accidents has  been considered by the Committee from two points of view, namely,how far such investigation is necessary in  the interests of public safety, and how far it will be of assistance inthe  advancement of aeronautical  research, and in the  improvement  of  design, construction,  and piloting.In  a general view of accident investigation the  Committee have been greatly  assisted by a detailed memo-raridum prepared for their use by  Mr. Harper  and Captain  Hucks,  which  is   attached  to this report as appendix  E.  This memorandum deals  with  the subject under  different  heads, and contains  much  useful Appendixinformation of a technical character, including a summary  of the work,  prior to the war, of the Public  SafetyE. P- 80 -and Accidents Investigation Committee of the Royal ,Aero Club and Aeronautical Society.    16.  There appears to the Committee to be a broad  distinction between accidents  occurring to aircraftcarrying passengers for hire and those occurring to aircraft  privately  owned and used.  In  the former caseinvestigation of an official nature seems necessary in the interests  of the public  and the analogy is suggestedof the investigation undertaken by the Railway Department  of  the Board of Trade of accidents of a seriousnature on railways.  The Board of Trade  enquiries are undertaken by officials possessing a wide expert know-ledge of their subject, and it seems to the Committee that the  investigation  in  the case of aircraft  should similarly  be undertaken either by or with the assistance of  experts.   The Committee, therefore, recommendthat all accidents of a serious nature to aircraft carrying passengers  for hire should be  the subject  of  anofficial investigation,  and  that power should be  conferred on  the  appropriate Government  department,whether it be the Board of Trade or the Air  Ministry, to  compel such investigation  and  to-regulate themanner in which it should be  undertaken.  In view of their opinion as to the necessity of expert assistance,the  Cqmmittee further recommend that in  carrying out their duties in this  respect, the Government depaH-ment should invite the co-operation of the  research organisation referred to in  their Interim Report.%  17. In the case of accidents to aircraft privately owned and used it appears to the Committee that investi-gation should not be made a matter of compulsion.  The information obtained  therefrom may,  however, beof the greatest assistance in the advancement of aeronautical knowledge,  and  should be regarded as an aid to research generally.  Before the war the  Public Safety and Accidents Investigation Committee of the RoyalAero Club and Aeronautical Society were  able, without possessing any  compulsory powers, to  obtain muchuseful information as  to the  causes  and  prevention of accidents.   The Committee recommend that after thewar steps should be taken to ensure  the continuance of this or  a  similar  Committee to carry on the work of investigation of accidents other than those referred to in paragraph 16, and lihat such Committee should co-operate with the research organisation in furnishing to them the  data obtained in their investigations.
                                           II.  EDUCATION.     18. The modifications in the conditions of civil life introduced  by  new  inventions  have  in the  past followed  a gradual development.   Progress in  design and construction has resulted from experience gained in everyday  use.  Eail and  road  transport are but two illustrations of  this process.   Aerial transport will probably form a unique exception  to the rule. The aeronautical  industry  was in its  infancy when the wa&quot; started, and, when peace is  declared, will find itself grown up with the advantage of a great body of accumu lated knowledge.  This knowledge will have been acquired solely from the military use of aircraft, and may not  be immediately applicable in all respects to the problems of civil aeronautics.  Some period of time will, no doubt, have to be devoted to the design of purely commercial machines.  Nevertheless, there is every reason to expect that the industry will be in a position to meet efficiently and adequately the urgent demand for more rapid transit, and  that aerial transport will  pass, though not without an awkward transition stage, into the routine of civil life.     19.  The requirements of military  aeronautics will by no means cease with the war.  The country has no doubt realised that safety requires the maintenance of two  fleets, and the  necessity of shouldering the financial burden involved in the maintenance of  an  efficient aerial navy.  We may, therefore, conclude that aeronautical construction will,  whether measured  by-the capital invested or the labour employed, eventually rank among our most important industries.  The prosperity  of  an industry depends in the first instance on the  demand for its products, and  in the long run on the efficiency of the production; it is first stimulated by national requirements, later on  by international competition.   Where  the  manufacture is a matter of old- established routine and custom, its  rise or fall is slow, but rapid where  sound scientific knowledge and high technical skill  are essential.     20.  We are thus led to the  conclusion that the demand  for the best training in  aeronautics is urgent, and that, including all classes, from the skilled artisan to  the scientifically trained engineer, and from the air  mechanic to the pilot working on international lines of communication, the numbers of men to&apos;be trained will be considerable.  At the present moment the war has emptied the Universities and Technical Colleges, and consequently &quot;there is no supply  of men whose scientific education and engineering training would other- wise have been in progress or in  course of completion.  The recommendations which follow should, therefore, be read  as applicable to a future period when the disturbance caused by the war, particularly in educational progress, has ceased.                                         Engineers and Designers.     21.  It is not proposed to deal here with the training  of the  mechanics or artisans, who, of course,&quot; form numerically the largest portion of the total; this  matter.has been referred to another Special Committee. Their training will doubtless entail &quot;the formation of  special classes at the principal technical schools, more especi- ally at those situated in the  neighbourhood of important works or aerodromes.  At these institutions classes will also be organised suitable for engineers and draughtsmen who wish to  improve their  theoretical know- ledge while engaged in practical  work.  On the other hand the engineering schools at most Universities will doubtless recognise that, just as  under present circumstances the education of  a mechanical engineer is  in- complete without some general knowledge of electrical engineering, so, in future, all  engineers should have at least  a  superficial knowledge of  aeronautical  engineering.   For the  civil engineer it will offer some instruc- tive instances  in the study of structural design,  and some  reference to aeronautical engines will necessarily form part  of any mechanical engineering course.     22.  The least numerous, but not  the least important, class  to be provided  for is that which includes the men who, in due course, will direct research, design, and  construction.  Aeronautical engineers must, in the first instance,  be fully qualified mechanical engineers,  having   had  a  sound,  practical  and  an advanced theoretical training.  They should, in addition, have had  an opportunity  of  devoting adequate time  to the scientific study of aeronautics, and  be  familiar with the details   of aircraft design and construction.   It  is evident that the period of study will be longer, and the test of  ability more stringent, than in many  other branches of the engineering profession.     23.  The Universities provide  courses in Mechanical Engineering which extend  over  three  years.   Such courses would  form a satisfactory preliminary to the more specialised training.  During this period the student intending  to specialise in aeronautics would spend his long vacation in aircraft works, and thus acquire some practical knowledge.  The fourth year would be devoted  entirely to specialised  study, and  would be followed by one or two years&apos;  experience  in  works, including a period in the drawing office and a period on an aero- drome.  After  such a training  the student would be fitted  for a  position of some responsibility,  and should have a reasonable prospect of rising, in due course, to the top  of his profession as a consulting  engineer, a managing-director, a chief engineer, chief designer, or chief draughtsman.                -  &quot;       *     24.  As outlined above, the specialised training of the aeronautical engineer would be a post-graduate course, and the question  arises as to the nature of the institutions at which such courses should be  organised.   It has already been pointed out that whatever the devolopment of the industry may be, the number of  posts suitable for  men  of the highest standard of training is  necessarily  limited,  and  it is  equally  obvious that men possessing the  combination  of theoretical aptitude and practical ability  required to  profit by such a training are  not numerous. Before the war the total yearly number of honours graduates in engineering, including civil, mechanical, electrical engineerings  and naval architecture, etc., from all the Universities in the United King- dom averaged  about two hundred.                       *                                               *     25.  It would appear, therefore, that one or  two institutions  could deal with the demand which will arise for  the highest specialised training in aeronautical engineering.  Such an institution should certainly exist in the London district, and one in the North of England or in Scotland would probably also be required.   The London school might either be : i  .  (a)  Attached to the Imperial College, where the students would have the advantage of coming in contact         with the members of a distinguished teaching  staff, and  could conveniently make use of many of the         existing  laboratories; or     (b)  it might  be attached to some research and testing institution, established on an  aerodrome, and,  in         connec^on with its educational work, be recognised by the University of London.
                                                                                                     104                                                   rs li the school were attached to tho Imperial College, the buildings  might bo  situated on  the  ground of the Central Research  Laboratory  suggested  in  paragraph 9 of our  interim report.   Those attending the school would then be under the  Imperial  College  for all purposes of teaching, but would have access to the Central Research  Laboratory for the purpose of studying  experimental work.  Such an arrangement would involve co-operation between the bodies named, the student dividing his  time between the two.I19    26. There are, of course, men  who could ill  afford the considerable expense involved by  so prolonged a period of training.  An adequate system of scholarships, financed by the Board of Education, should be estab- lished, so that no student of exceptional ability need abandon  his studies through  the  want of the necessary financial resources.   On the other hand,  many men likely to  prove  of great value to the industry  may not possess the necessary aptitude or the inclination to carry their theoretical studies to the highest point.     27. The system of education should be sufficiently flexible  to  provide  for the  full  development  of  any exceptional  ability in whatever direction it may be.  In. the present case it would be desirable for the Central Institution recommended in  paragraph 25 also to provide courses based on a sound general engineering know ledge.  Men attending these courses would  presumably be required to  have studied for  two years  at  some recognised institution, either a University or a higher Technical   School,   and   to  have  had some  works experience.     The establishment of such an Institution would involve a  considerable expenditure of capital.   No such institution is  self-supporting, the fees  forming usually but a small proportion  of the total expenditure.   A yearly sum of about  6,000 would be required.                                      Training of Flyers and Pilots.     .28. It is not possible to outline a scheme for the training of civil flyers  and pilots without first considering briefly the new conditions which will follow any extended adoption of aircraft for transport work.     It may be assumed  that, apart from  naval and military aircraft&apos;, two classes of aircraft will exist:       (a) Those owned by companies which will maintain passenger or despatch  services, or be chartered  for         special journeys.     (b) Those owned by private individuals, which will occupy a position between the yacht used  exclusively        for pleasure  and exploration and  the private motor car used for pleasure and business. These will naturally be employed on various services which may  be sub-divided into :-      (i.)  Local.      (ii.)  National.     (hi.)  International.     29. Before the war there were in this country some  five thousand  yachts  and  several  hundred thousand private cars. With regard to numbers, the privately-owned  aircraft may eventually be expected to reach an intermediate place. In many cases the owner will qualify as a flyer, and some of his employees will, presumably, be  primarily expected to look after the upkeep of the machine, but will doubtless be required to be capable oLflying it also. The owner&apos;s training will depend on the  time he devotes to  it,  and his desire to excel in it. No  definite rules can be laid down for his training; but we can  assume that a considerable  number  of pupils of this kind will present themselves at the various training groundB.     30. Those who adopt flying as an employment (apart from  a  few amateurs, who might receive a nominal remuneration, and would expect to be provided with a staff  of mechanics to keep the machine in  order) will probably be drawn from  two classes :    -     (a) The professional flyer, who will receive a  substantial remuneration, and will be the responsible super-         visor of a staff who will attend to mechanical matters ;     (b) The chauffeur-flyer, who will be expected to clean  and repair the  machine, and be capable  of flying         it when required. These classes will, no doubt, hold a certificate awarded on the successful completion of some  prescribed course of tuition in flying.   The chauffeur-flyer will, in addition, be required to possess the qualifications of a skilled mechanic, and in the event of such  a flyer taking charge of passenger aircraft plying  for  hire, there will be&apos; special obligatory tests of qualification to ensure adequate protection  for the public.     31. The three classes of commercial transport will call for  men of different training :-     (a) For local transport, proficiency in fly;ng  and knowledge of the rules of the air and of agreed signals        will be essential qualifications.     (b) For national transport, involving long journeys in  the  United  Kingdom,  e.g.,  from  London  to        Glasgow, a  knowledge of map-reading and some knowledge of  meteorology  will  be necessary  as        additional qualifications.     (c) For most international transport  routes a knowledge  of navigation and a more complete knowledge        of meteorology will  be required, in addition to the qualifications mentioned in  (a)  and (b).     It is  indispensable in all cases that there should be  a proper understanding  of  all  the instruments  nployed and of the  elements of the scientific reasons for  their use.     It is probable that aircraft used on international lines of communication  will eventually be of large size. In this case the man at  the controls becomes the helmsman, and the craft is under the command of a captain or pilot.  Mutatis mutandis] the training  required for this post is that received by the navigating  officer of a liner.  An appreciation of the functions of wireless telegraphy will also be needed.     32. The above forecast appears to indicate that a large  number of schools will be required for tuition  in flying, whether or not special flying certificates are sought.  Presumably  most main aerodromes will have a flying school attached.   The object of the tuition in such schools has in the past been to  reach the  standard
set by  the certificate* of the Royal Aero Club, and the Committee consider that there would be advantages in continuing this system.    33. In  addition, at least one school of aerial navigation will be required, at which, amongst other neces-sary subjects,  map reading, the use of the  compass, astronomy, signalling, and wireless telegraphy andmeteorology will be taught.                                                                              ^    34. The standard required for the flying  certificate should be reached after a few months&apos; training in an aerodrome.  It would imply the ability to fly  any usual  type of machine, and a  number of extended  cross-country flights would be required.  It would not imply any  special engineering training, but  merely  theknowledge required to  verify the adjustment of the rigging, to start and  control the engine satisfactorily,  andto adjust and replace valves and  minor fittings.   The courses at the school of navigation would extend over one year, at the end of which time the students would be  required  to pass  an  examination  in the subjectstaught.  The training in navigation could  not, however, be  regarded as complete  until the student could giveproof of continuous and satisfactory practical experience extending over a period of time.

1(APPENDIX  A.Report   on  the  Preparation  of  an  Aeronautical  Treatise,  At tho June meeting of the Committee, a Panel, consisting jf Major Taylor, Professor Petavol, Mr.  Berriman, and Mr. Selby  was appointed  to  draw up  some  suggestions for  a treatise  on aeronautics,  to give effect to Professor Petavel&apos;s proposal  No. 3.  The main purpose of such a treatise would be to put in a convenient form the present results of scientific inquiry  into aeronautics.   The material  for such a treatise would  be  found in the Technical  Reports of  the Advisory Committee for  Aeronautics,,  the publications  of M. Eiffel, and the papers issued from  the Aeronautical  Institutes at Gottingen, Koutehino,  and  elsewhere.     Other  important sources of  supply will be the Transactions  of the Aeronautical Society,  the various technical journals, English and foreign, arid existing books.  Such a treatise would be the work of various writers; the first step would be to find an editor, who  would, no doubt, write some parts of the book himself, but  whose main working would  be to  obtain and  edit  the various  contributions which would go to compose the treatise.  If a scheme  for issuing abstracts is  developed, it might perhaps be arranged that  the same man should act as editor for  this, but that ought not to be looked upon  as essential.  Some estimate of the time required and the funds necessaryto pay  the editor and staff must be formed.  It is difficultto do this with any completeness until  the  editor has been provisionally selected,  and some  scheme for  the contents  ofthe book has been approved.  Some portion, at any rate,  of.the cost ought to be recovered from the sale of the book.  ,It would,  no doubt, be desirable for the  Sub-Committee  toindicate the name of a possible editor, to make some sugges-tion as to the remuneration he should  receive, and, if pos-sible, to frame an estimate of the time required to write thebook,&apos; but  under present war conditions it  has not provedfeasible to  do  this.  The  Sub-Committee,   however,  have reason to  hope that Mr.  Bairstow would undertake the dutyon  the  conclusion of peace, or failing this, we may look&apos; forassistance as editor from Mr. Selby.  Mr.  Selby has prepared a schedule of the suggested con-tents of the Report,  as an  indication of what the Committeehave in view,  not with  the  intention of settling its  futurecontents now;  this must be  left  to the editor.

   Tho increase of aviation which will  bo  brought about by tho introduction of aerial transport on a commercial basis will greatly enlarge the  demands made upon both practical and theoretical meteorology, in order that the dangers and obstacles duo  to meteorological conditions may be reduced so far  as may be practicable.   These demands must bo met by both  special investigations into  various meteorological problems, and the  provision, in forms suitable to the needs of aviation,  of the information which has  been  accumulated during more than half  a con- tury of co-operative effort.  Modern meteorology has been  built  up  on  the  study of the physics of the  atmosphere, and further  advance will be attained by the same method.  The investigation of such phenomena as the foraiation of  mist and fog,  conditions which affect visibility,  turbulence in the lower strata  of the atmosphere, which are already being studied,  are types of the work required, and  other problems  will doubtless  be suggested at the meetings of this Committee.   The Central Institute, the Meteorological  Office, and  its Observatories, will naturally be largely occupied with this form of research, but ili  miay &apos;be  assumed  that, as  coon as the universities provide  facilities for the  study of  advanced  meteorology, such investigations will be undertaken  there also.  Weather  changes,  forecasts, and warnings  can only be adequately  studied at the Central  Institute, where  large- scale working  maps are prepared regularly, at which data are received several times daily and where a very complete collection of meteorological data from all countries is  avail- able for comparison study, so that the practicability  of ex- tending the period for which weather changes can be fore- told must be undertaken there.  The study  of  tho  special features  of  the  weather  in localities where winds of  exceptional violence, great turbu- lence of air currents  or  othon abnormal phenomena  occur, will be important, and this will necessitate  a  scheme of suitably  planned observations ta&apos;ken on the spot, together with their critical discussion by competent meteorologists.  While  pure  research,  the  investigation of  phenomena under well defined conditions will always go on more or less steadily, provision must be made for the  further study of the phenomena under various meteorological conditions to determine the modifications which may  be  caused1.   this extension of the work is essential in order that the results ofmeteorological  research may be of practical utility.  Intimately connected with  such  investigations are  the collection and  discussion of the material on which they are based.  Observations  of pressure, wind, temperature,  rain- fall, fog, &amp;c, have been accumulated for  many years  past, but both those of this country and those from many places abroad will  require re-discussion in order to  provide  the special kind  of information which is now required, and  which differs from that which isHised for climatic studies. Obser- vations  of the upper air  have become very numerous and are constantly  increasing;  they, too, have to be compiled and prepared for ready reference.  In this field  particularly a closer connection between the practical experiences of thfc pilot and the investigations of the scientific meteorologist is most desirable, for Avhat  is a matter of common knowledge^ to the one may provide confirmatory evidence for  which the?other has been  vainly seeking.  The present supply of data from ships will need increasing where routes cross  tho  sea, in order that tho information. available on land may  bo  extended to tho  sea area  witlf confidence; and to this will now bo added the observations made or obtained by aviators during &quot;their flights,  To com- bino these satisfactorily with  those representing tho condi- tions over neighbouring  areas  will require tho same careful organisation as was necessary for marine observations when wireless  telegraphy was first introduced, for incorrect obser- vations or data obtained by faulty instruments lead to false conclusions which  may  not be  merely  useless,  but  even dangerous.  The incorporation,  discussion  or  recasting, as may  be necessary, of the meteorological  data of foreign countries, as  it becomes  available, will also be an important duty of the Central Institute.  The speed of modern aircraft moving along  air routes will presumably necessitate some rearrangement in tho provision of  forecasts and weathen  warnings.    While  the  Central Institute will  receive reports  from a  very wide area and deduce from them the probable changes which will occur, a well-selected network of secondary  stations  will also  be necessary.  These stations  will receive, besides their own observations, reports from the Central Institute and  other stations, which will enable  them to prepare a weather-map of their  district and to  follow the iweather changes over i in greater detail than at the Central Institute.  They would be  ready to furnish short-period forecasts or warnings to aviators  in the district or on the section of a route passiu near it.   Thus the necessary  organisation will include :- (a) Central Institute; (b) Local Warning Stations; (c) numc rous Observing Stations,  besides certain Institutes.  The Central Institute is represented by the  Meteorological Office, with its observatories, where phenomena can be inves tigated and  the results  brought into touch with the  prat tical application of Meteorology,  and the existence or six observatories  dependent  on  the  Meteorological Office  in different parts  of Great Britain provides large opportunities for such  work.   At the Meteorological Office also the accumu lated observations of over sixty years from many stations at home and abroad, which have been tabulated  and discussed provide a irich store of material ready for the investigation of special subjects, and  the preparation of new data  could be economically met by an extension of the present arrange ments.  The Forecasting service will probably have to be arranged on  the basis of continuous duty, so that inquiries can  bo dealt with at any time,  and, besides the general forecasts issued at fixed hours, the Forecast Service should telegraph sufficient meteorological data to Local Warning Stations to enable them to follow the weather conditions of their dis tricts and  to give warnings of disturbances likely to affect them.              &apos; cThe  connection  between  Meteorological   Research  and Practical  Aviation  could  bo  facilitated  at   aeronautical research Centres, where a  trained meteorologist could not only contribute his own observations, but also bring thepractical experience  of pilots to the knowledge of meteorologists, and  demonstrate the  Rearing of advances in meteorology on  aeronautics.

Meteorological Ollicc,                               South Kensington,                                        London,  S.W.front                               11th August, 1917.    ,0. Malcolm,  Esq.,        Civil Aerial Transport Committee. Dear Sir,   in reply to your letter of August 4th,  I quite agree with the lines oi1  Major Lyons&apos; Memorandum  of 27tli july, l&apos;Jlv. 1  should add to tho preamble some  words about taking  ad-; vantage of  favourable meteorological conditions as well&apos;as &apos;-&apos;  reducing tlie dangers and obstacles &quot; of unfavourable ones, because, on  the whole, the weather is  beneiicent,  and its iavourablo moods are as well worth /considering as its occa- sional ill-tempers.  That, however, is merely a  matter of form. .   2. In substance, I gather, Major Lyons suggests an exten- sion of the present public meteorological service to meet the special and local needs of a regular service of aerial trans- port.  A public  meteorological  service is essentially an organised    enquire within &apos;  upon all  questions in  which the weather  is concerned.  It must  be prepared on demand to supply an answer to any question about the weather past, present or future, in any part of the world to which, in  the present state of our knowledge,  an answer  can be given. it must, therefore, have all its information and its Know- iedge ready in  advance  before it  knows what  question is going to be  asked.  iWo are quite used to that situation so lar as surface weather is concerned.  The underlying prin- ciples  of  the present scheme  of  the meteorological service are:  (I) The collection and organised arrangement of trustworthy     information  about past weather from every part of the     globe. (2) The periodical notification by telegraph of the present     weatlier  from stations  representing  as  wide an area as     possible  surrounding  the United Kingdom,  to form the     basis of maps upon which forecasts of weather are based     in accordance with&apos; the recognised teachings of ineteoro-     logical science. (3) The distribution of the  information so collected either in     summary or  detail   in  reply to specific enquiries or in     anticipation of enquiries in common form. (4) The study of the information collected in  conjunction     with that obtained  at  the special  observatories and     stations  of the Office  in order to improve, by investiga-     tion and research, the position  of the Office in relation     to replies to enquiries of every kind.   3. The  new  features   introduced by the needs of  aerial transport are, first, that  the subject of possible questions is extended  to include the  atmosphere  up to 20,000 feet,  a region that, until recently, we have studied only for the light that it  throws  upon meteorological science; secondly, that the scientific questions that arise are rather more recondite and require  more specific answers than  those  which have commonly been addressed  to us from outside the Office in tho past; and, thirdly,  that  the airman&apos;s horizontal  range is wider:  he needs to draw  upon information  from  a  wider area, and to have the information at his disposal in a com- pendious form practically  at any aerodrome and at any time of the day or night.  In other words, there must be provision for studying  the  structure and properties of the atmosphere from the  special point of view of aircraft, which  involves some extension of our organisation  for study  and  research, and for obtaining the material necessary for that study; and there must be some extension of our means of communicating general and special information  to those  interested  in aircraft.   4. What Major Lyons obviously realises is that the provi- sion for conveying information to aircraft pilots is not com- plete unless  the  pilot has an opportunity of discussing  the situation with a meteorological expert,  by which I do  not mean an inspired weather-prophet  who  makes  an oracular statement that enables the pilot to dismiss the weather from his thoughts, but simply an educated person who knows what information weather maps do, and do not, contain, and what it  means; what additional information is available and where and how it is to  be  found.   In  fact, a pilot wants access to a &quot; map room,&quot;  where he can consult a weather map just as he would consult  a  topographical  map; but as  the weather map is changeable from day to  day, and  even from hour toWir, it cannot be drawn once and for all and  carried in the Picket on a long journey;  it must be redrawn periodically on the spot, and the person who  drew it should  be there to explain its meaning.  5. At present the only public provision  for consultation of this kind is  at the Meteorological Office in London. Many useful consultations with  balloonists have been held there, hut  that  is  not sufficient  for regular  aerial  transport. Adequate information of  the same kind  is wanted in other localities.    The  recognised  provision  at present for  other places is to send  a copy of the Daily Weather Report, which &apos;.s  then somewhat belated,  and has generally to bo read with- Qut the advantage of an expert  to consult.  The &quot;alternative *o posting or  delivering the Daily Weather Report is to makea reply to a definite question sent by telegraph; but one ques-tion and one answer are insufficient, everyone wants to askfurther  questions  in  case  the answer to the first is notexhaustive, as it seldom is.  6. Assuming that aerodromes  will be connected by  tele-phone with wiiat, on the analogy of railways, may be called&quot; termini,&quot; an obvious step would be to have local meteors-logical establishments at those termini, such as Edinburghor  Glasgow, Liverpool,  Dublin,  Queenstown,  Cardiff,  Ply-mouth,  and,  perhaps,  other  places.   Each establishmentshould consist  of  a   map room &quot; in charge of an expert,who would keep  a suitable library of reference and would discuss the meteorological  situation orally or over the tele-phone with pilots and  others.    These experts  should  beattached to the staff of the  Meteorological Office and  takeregular turns of duty at the Office, so that they may be keptquite up to date both as to information and methods.  Eachexpert would require a junior as learner, or two if the station is to be open continuously.  These are the  Local WarningStations which Major Lyons enumerates under (b).  The mento  be employed on these  posts  should be men with ampleknowledge  and practice of  mathematics and physics, whohave had  a regular course of training  at a University  or technical Institute.  7. Provision of this kind  is necessary in the public interest;not only for the information of airmen, but also for all the many classes  of  the  community who are interested in  anadequate knowledge of the ways of the weatlier as affecting,eg.,  shipping  and other  forms  of  transport agricultureand horticulture and catering.  It has already been under-taken by  the  Office for the Air Services at South  Farn-borough and for tho Armies in France and Salonika.  Theprincipal difficulty that has had to be met is the lack of men with suitable training.  When the war began there were motmore than twenty all  told  on  the  Office  establishments.Some fifty more have been passed through the Office for thometeorological service of the Armies,  and many of these willbe available after the war.  8. Another different but  equally important part of the pro.gramme is the instruction of pilots and others in the methodsof modern  meteorology,  carried  sufficiently far for them toknow the kind of question to wheh meteorological science can give an answer, so that they may not find themselves at cross-purposes in consultation with a meteorological expert.  Thisrequires  the preparation of  suitable  official handbooks, andsome provision by way of lectures or  teaching for discussing the  contents with the airmen.  It seems important that thehandbooks should bo  official, because they should be guidesto the use of official intelligence,  arid  that object wants to bekept steadily in view; but it will require some pressure onthe  Meteorologcal Office to get handbooks prepared, becausewhen a subject is  developing daily under one&apos;s own hands itis very difficult to shut off  and stereotype one&apos;s knowledge ina book.  In a university or technical institute there are lolngvacations when other work is shut down, but in an office theincrease of information goes on continuously, and  to the writer the  work  gets out  of date while it is in his hands.Still, it  is  important that this  work should be done by theOffice Staff.  9. There  remain what Major  Lyons calls  &quot;  aeronautical research centres.&quot;  It would be natural that these should be organised in connection with courses of aeronautical engineer.ing  and aeronautical theory at  teaching centres universities-ties or  technical  institutes.  The aeronautical researchersshould, somehow or other, be in close communication with theaviators, but a much-frequented aerodrome in the highwayof aerial traffic is not  a good place  for meteorological ap-paratus that has  to&apos; project a considerable way  from  theground,  or that uses  steel wive, as for kites  and captiveballoons, so the communication  is best arranged  through ateaching centre which is common ground.    Moreover, thedirection of experimental  researches in  the physics anddynamics of the  atmosphere requires  not only high  profes-sional qualifications, but  also  the assistance of  a  body of students with a good deal of available time.  10. I have set  these things out at length in order  to leadup  to the vital question of your letter; by what means theCivil Aerial Transport Committee could best assist in seeing that Major Lyons&apos; suggestions should be carried out.  Thebest means seem to me to be, first, to ask the MeteorologicalCommittee, which has the  requisite experience, to set up byway of experiment at one of  the terminals mentioned a localmeteorological  establishment of this kind which I have indi-cated herein as necessary  for the purpose  which the Com-mittee has in view; and, secondly, to ask the Imperial college of Science  and  Technology  and/or the Universities or Techni-cal   Institutes  of  Edinburgh,  Glasgow, Dublin,  Liverpool,Cardiff,  Southampton and Plymouth, to set  up a teachingcentre for Aeronautical  Engineering, Aeronautioal Theoryand the  structure of the atmosphere; or perhaps a circularprepared by the Committee asking universities and technicalinstitutes to make a point of giving students the opportunityof learning those subjects which would lead to the provision which is required               (Signed)  NAPIER SHAW.
APPENDIX E.Memorandum  by Captain  B.  C.  Hucks,  R.A.F.,  and  the Assistant Secretary  (Technical),     as to  Accidents  and Accident Investigation, with an  Annex  Summarising the  Work,     Prior  to the War,  or  the Public Safety and Accidents  Investigation Committee  of the     Royal  Aero  Club  and  Aeronautical  Society.   ,l.fc is proposed to deal with the subject under the following heads:    J  Au outline of the most common forms  of accident at the       present time.  II  The  necessity for an  investigation of  accidents,  even       some of those not having serious results, with a  view       to the determination of their causes. Ill  Methods  of obtaining  reliable information. IV The necessity for  an expert examination and classifica-       tion of data obtained.  V The use to which  the results of examination can be put.                           I.               CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS.   Aeroplane accidents are, as a rule, due to one or other of the following causes, or sometimes to a combination of  such causes:    A!  Engine stoppage, etc.   B.  Errors  in Piloting.  1. Want of experience and  hur-       ried teaching.  &apos;2. Real  errors of  judgment.   3.        Rashness.   C.  Faulty   construction.  1. Design.    2. Construction.       3.: Materials.   D.  Dangerous manoeuvres.  E.  Meteorological conditions.   F.  Fires.   G.  Illness of a pilot while in flight.   Before  examining very briefly some of the accidents due to one or other of these causes, or a combination of any of them, it should be  noted that,  with pilots who  are fully experi-. experienced and know their engines, grounds,  winds and  weather signs, accidents under the peace conditions of flying should become rare. .1. Engine Stoppage,  etc.   The stoppage of an engine in  the air should not, under favourable circumstances, imply any serious risk of accident. His   mechanical  power gone,  the flyer  must  necessarily descend.  He can and must maintain the forward speed of his machine and the support  of its planes, by gliding down- ward  in a gradually  descending path; but  if  he  is  over, thickly-wooded, broken, or mountainous country, it may be difficult for him to find a suitable landing point, and he-may, should he make his contact with  bad  ground,  break some portion of his alighting gear, or perhaps damage his machine more seriously.  But if he is  dexterous he may,  and usually does, save himself and his passengers from serious injury.  To  many flyers the sudden stoppage of their engine is dis- concerting, leading them to errors of judgment they would not be guilty  of under normal conditions.   So it may happen that  at a moment when exceptional judgment is demandedof him, a flyer is not in a condition to act correctly and with unswerving precision.  When his engine has failed a flyer&apos;s first thought, naturally, is to  make a  descent  at  some  point  where  the ground is suitable,  and  where he will avoid  damaging his machine,  or injuring himself or his passengers. If he is near an aero- drome he will endeavour to reach  this aerodrome.  It has in the past happened not infrequently that an engine has failed  say through some disorganisation iri the petrol pressure feed as a  result of &quot; taxying &quot; a  machine prior to a flight not long  after a machine  has left the ground and before it has gained altitude.   The instinct of the flyer under such condi- tions is to endeavour to turn his machine in the air and glide back  to the aerodrome rather than make a landing in any field or open space which may lie within reach.  But while in the act of turning remembering that he has been more or less  disconcerted  by the sudden failure of his  motor,  and remembering  also that owing to the rapid growth of the art of flying thoroughly  experienced  pilots  are few he  may, make the mistake of gliding at so flat an angle while on the turn that  the air  pressure under  the  inner  wing  of  his machine falls  so low that it is insufficient for the support of that side of the machine;  whereupon the aeroplane begins a side-slip which may turn into a spinning nose-dive and this means that, for the moment at any rate, the craft has passed beyond the jflyer&apos;s control.  If, however, he is at a sutficient altitude when this happens, he may be able to extricate  the aeroplane from its spinning dive; but should he be near the ground when his machine side-slips he will probably be unable to regain control before it crashes.4  It  would be  safer  in  some  cases after  an  engine  has failed,  and  particularly   when  failure, takes  place  with the  aeroplane at  a  low  altitude,  if  flyers   glided  onstraight  ahead  and  did  not  endeavour  to   turn.  This might,  it  is  true,   involve  a  descent on   unsuitable ground, with  some slight   damage,  perhaps,  to  the  under- carriage, but  this would  be  far  better than losing control altogether.  A fact to be remembered is that if an aeroplane loses flying speed while moving straight ahead  it not only loses height less rapidly, but there  is tar less risk of a side- slip, as all stable machines tend, when  the flying speed h reduced below a certain point, to  take  up  automatically a safe gliding angle.  Probably the origin of  the majority  of  accidents  at  thepresent time is stoppage of the engine,  after which a flyer is frequently guilty of some error of judgment,  or of pilot. ing, or of both; and such errors are due in most cases to the anxiety of the flyer to reach some specific landing ground- - an  anxiety which  will be  all the more  acute should  engine failure have occurred when the machine is low.  This points to the fact that when airways are established, with landing grounds fairly close  together along  each route, the main cause of accidents will have been removed.  Under such improved conditions,  should an  engine fail while  an aeroplane is in flight, an aviator will not find it necessary to turn  and manoeuvre  in the air, during a  glide  without motive power, in order to reach some landing ground that is not readily  accessible.  Subject, to his  being  at  a sufficient altitude, he will be able to glide to whichever&apos;alighting place on  the  chain  of grounds  may  lie before him, and make a landing under favourable conditions on  a sufficiently smoothground.  Even with  such  landing places available, an engine may fail so soon after a pilot has left the ground that he is! unable to reach the next  alighting point,  though this may be onlya few miles distant.   Under such  conditions, assuming  he has insufficient altitude at which to make a safe turn,  heshould glide down in the open country and pick the best land-ing he can.  It is  worth while, therefore, to bear this con- contingency in mind,  and to see that the land is fairly open in the immediate vicinity of aerodromes.  Improved reliability of  engines, and the rapid growth of skill, experience, and a sense of responsibility in ground men and  mechanics,  should  render improbable cases  of  engine failure occurring almost directly after an aeroplane has left*Note by Major G. I.  Taylor.  &quot; Many accidents occur wben  an engine stops shortly after a machine has left the ground, and before it has attained a height of more than a few hundred feet:  Under these circumstances, ifthe readings of the instruments  are used intelligently,  it is fre-quently possible to turn back into the aerodrome; but what oftenhappens is that the pilot, instead  of looking at the instruments.looks only at the ground  Under these circumstances, after he hasturned  across  the wind,  the ground may appear to him if  jjfljturn has been correctly banked to be moving sideways under him and in  the direction it would appear to move if he were doing avery much over-banked turn  at a greater height above the ground.The pilotfs  instinct is therefore  to hold  the lower  wing up. andto make an  under-banked turn.   The number  of accidents due tofaulty piloting, on  the part of inexperienced pilots during a turnnear the ground, might  be. greatly reduced by better  education,and also by a greater confidence in  the instruments.,  which  arenow Mxtremely reliable.&quot;          .   appendix&apos; D.Meteorological  Establishments.
 the ground; while the careful training  of flyers should pro- vent them from falling into tho error of starting away on a flight with a motor that is not running well. li. Errors in Piloting.   Errors in piloting, so far as one can  isolate  them as at cause of accident, are not likely to involve a flyer in much/ danger  so long as he is at a sufficient altitude.  Peace flying will also remove the necessity from all civil flyers of making those extreme manoeuvres which  are called for  in  war  in darting from  or at an enemy, or  spinning down  to get out of his reach, so that all errors connected with practising theso evolutions will be absent.   The comparative leisure of peace flying should tend also to prevent accidents due to hurried teaching, or to errors of judgment on  the  part of instructors  in ordering  pupils to make flights or carry out manoeuvres for which their degree of proficiency  has not prepared them.  Rashness on the part of young flyers, and the taking of unnecessary risks, should also he discouraged more effectually when a longer period can be allowed for tuition, and when there are not the exigencies of war to justify such risks.   Errors in piloting, when an aviator is making  his contact with the ground after a flight, account for a  large number of  accidents,  though  these,  generally  speaking,   are not attended by serious consequences.  A broken under-carriage is, as a rule, the worst that happens,  and though experience shows that  an aeroplane may overturn occasionally  and  be damaged badly, its occupants generally escape.  Landing with the wind instead of against  it will often lead  to a machine being damaged by  collision through a pilot failing to bring it  to  a standstill  within the  length  of  run he  normally expects.   Another error of piloting when in the act of  descending is to alight side to wind.-    In this  case, if the aeroplane has a sideway as well as a forward  motion at the moment of contact with the ground the mnning wheels may buckle, and the breakage of the entire chassis, and perhaps the over- turning of the machine, may result.   Such accidents in landing are not always to  be laid to the door of the flyer.   It  may happen, through the  absence of any wind-vane or smoke, which gives him a reliable indica- tion, that he  is unable to judge accurately the direction of the ground wind.   When chains of aerodromes are  in exist- ence it will be easy and  inexpensive to place  on each, in a position where it is seen easily by a pilot while descending, some standard type of wind-direction  indicator. C.  Faulty Construction.           \   Accidents due to faulty construction  are becoming far less frequent owing to the increasing knowledge  and  skill  of designers and constructors,  the adoption of amnle  actors of strength, and the care which is exercised in the choice and inspection of  materials  employed.    At present, however, greatly though design and construction have improved, it is possible for a  machine in the course of the violent manoeuvres dictated by war service, to be subjected to  such  abnormal strains that some  part of it collapses  and robs  the  pilot of control.   Another risk of structural breakage which must be reckoned with is that of a rough landing having dope some damage to  a  machine-say to the rear  of  the  fuselage.  This,  if  it escapes detection  at the time, may lead afterwards, when a  machine is subjected to strain, to a collapse in flight.   Constructional risks may be encountered, even in future. bv flyers who are called upon to handle machines of an experi- mental type, the behaviour of which,  when actually in flight. is being determined by practical tests.   These  risks affect only  indirectly the general  public or  potential  passengers. who would not be introduced till long after such risks had been studied  and  eliminated.  D. Dangerous Manoeuvres.   There should be a distinction, of course, between dangerous  manoeuvres which are unnecessary and those which are called for in  learning, and in afterwards performing,  the abrupt  and often violent  evolutions which must be made in aerial  fighting.   The risks  attached to the  latter  are inevitable  while  we are at war; but in commercial or pleasure flving,  when  only  safe and  reasonable  piloting will be required,  accidents under this heading should  become extremelv rare. In the  Air Force naturally,  even Tinder peace conditions. dangerous manoeuvres must  be carried out on occasion: but  there will be  no justification for them in civil flying.  E.  Meteorological  QoncKtions.It   Certain accidents, have, it seems probable, been due  to li abnormal  atmospheric conditions, or  at least  to the dis-  comfiture of  the pilot by such conditions; and data in this  regard: though a certain amount of information is alreadv  available need to be far more extensive.  We refer to this  question, briefly, under a later beading.           tf  F.  Fires.    This cause of accident, occurring when  a  machine is  in  flight,  or when it has crashed after a bad landing,  is now  receiving the  closest attention, and. under the less  arduous  conditions  of peace  flying,  and with  the  experience  anddata  already  obtained,  it  should become  possible  very greatly  to minimise this  danger.G. lll/ness of a Pilot. -  In the Annex to the  Appendix, a case is mentioned of an accident which was assumed to be due to the indispositionof the flyer, and there have boon  other obscure cases whichhave  been  attributed  to the  same  cause.  In  war flying,,under the strain of ascending rapidly  to  high altitudes, indiving steeply, or in spiralling or other violent movements,cases  are to be  expected of giddiness, or of temporary lossof consciousness.  In peace flying there should, ordinarily,be  none of these extreme physical strains;  and medicalexaminations,  carried  out periodically, should  obviate therisk of a commercial  pilot,  while in  charge say  of a  pas-senger  craft,, losing control  of  his machine  through, anysudden  attack of illness.                             II.    Till&apos;] NEED FOR  INVESTIGATING  ACCIDENTS.  Before tho war the Royal Aoro Club  and the AeronauticalSociety,  through their Accidents&apos;  Investigation Committee,whose findings vc twenty-six enquiries we summarise as an annex,  were -is  the  process of obtaining  valuable data;while recently a committee has been  appointed by the AirBoard,  under  the presidency  of Col. 0&apos;Gorman, to examinewhen called upon, by  the Services the causes of  accidentswhich befall naval and military pilots and machines.  Hitherto, however, and  at  the  present time, an accidenthas as a rule to be very  serious,  and generally fatal, before it is investigated; and while we are at war it is  unreason-1able to  expect that each  minor mishap shall be investigated.But when  peace comes,  and  we  enter on the era of  civil aerial transport, it will  be found no  doubt that firms willinvestigate  every accident which happens  to  their craft,even  though this should be no more serious  than the coni-pulsoiry  descent  of a,n aeroplane,  made  without hurt  to anyone on an  aerodrome,  through, let .us say; some slightengine  defect.  Enterprising  firms may  be  expected,  infact,  to study the details of everything that happens whichshould  not  happen;  of every  mechanical  breakdown,  no matter how insignificant,   which&apos; serves  to  delay  or inter-rupt  a  flight;   of every  kind  of atmospheric  condition,abnormal or otherwise, which affects the travel of  a machinefrom point to point,  or produces conditions which a  flyerhas not experienced .before.   The fatal accident  is  often the worst  to  approach fromthe point  of  view of investigation.   Both  the  occupantsof  a machine,  if  there is  a passenger  as well  as . pilot,may  be killed,  while  the machine itself, as  the result ofits crash, presents in  the  majority of cases such  a hopelessmass of wreckage that nothing&quot; definite can be learned from it. But where we should leam valuable lessons under peace conditions, is from those small  accidents  which, if  theyare  not investigated and  their  causes  discovered  andeliminated, may  lead eventually to serious accidents and loss of life.   In  minor mishaps  the  conditions  are often favourable for investigation.  Apart  from any testimony which maybe obtained from expert  eyewitnesses, there are  accessiblethe statements of those actually  in  the aeroplane:  while there is also  the machine itself, which,  though  it may be somewhat  damaged,   is  rarely  damaged badly  enough toprevent a  critical examination.                            in.                   \ -;METHODS OF  OBTAINING RELIABLE INFORMATION.   The  testimony of  lay  witnesses  to   an accident whopossess no technical knowledge  is generally unreliable.   Aman  may say he heard  an explosion  in  the  air,  and then,&apos; shortly afterwards, saw  a machine  fall.  This  gives theimpression  that the accident was due primarily to engine failure.  What  may have happened,  in  fact, is that the pilot merely switched off in  the ordinary way  and that  his engine  gave  the  not unusual  exhaust  pop,  or backfired harmlessly, making the noise  the  lay witness heard.   in reality the pilot, while gliding, may have lost control of  hismachine as the result of some error of judgment absolutely unconnected with the switching off of his engine.  If  too much reliance is placed on non-technical evidence, the trend of an  enquiry may be misdirected; but  at  the  sam&apos;e time it should often be possible, by a series of questions carefully framed, to gain useful information  from  a non-technical witness.   Before the war the Royal Aero Club, jointly with the Aeronautical Society,  in their scheme of  accident  investiga-tion,  appointed technical representatives on the principalaerodromes whose duty was,  when a  fatality  occurred, to collect all details possible, to examine the machine before it &apos;was  moved,  and   to prepare a. report  which could  beconsidered-if  necessary   with  other  evidence by  the Accidents&apos; Committee. Here was the nucleus of an orgahisa-
tion,  although the fifteen  representatives  which were  allthat had been appointed, prior to the war, will need to beincreased dn numbers  after the war.  The representatives on  the flying grounds, as appointed before  the  war,  werenot accident  investigators pure and simple; their mainandi permanent occupation lay generally in some executiveor other work in connection with an aerodrome.  Accidentinvestigation was a side&apos;issue  with  them,  which-they tookup  voluntarily.  It  might  happen,  therefore, under  suchconditions  of  appointment, that they were not present onan  aerodrome when  an  accident took place.   It was withsuch a contingency in mind that more  than one accidentrepresentative was appointed on the principal aerodromes.This arrangement proved adequate in pre-war times, whenonly very serious accidents were investigated,  but after thewar it  is  submitted that the permanent  appointment ofsuitable and salaried persons will be necessary.  Their dutyshould be  to  investigate accidents  which  happen in theirirespective  jurisdictions,  and  to  report to  some  centralauthority,  such  as  the Research Association.    These in-vestigators could be stationed at chosen aerodromes,  andtit seems probable that the widening  of  the field of in-yestigation before referred to, and  an  increasing volumeof  aerial  traffic would have  the   effect of keeping themoccupied.                      j  It  is (suggested  that  the  investigators  at main aero-dromes  should have a certain number of the  subsidiarygrounds in their neighbourhood placed  within their juris-diction.  At these smaller grounds  the expert investigatorfrom the main aerodrome could, from among the staff avail-able,  appoint someone  to represent  him in the case  of an accident, and to make any preliminary  investigation thatmight be  necessary before he (the  expert  investigator)arrived.  In this way,  with permanent investigators on theprincipal aerodromes, and with these men appointing repre-sentatives  on  intermediate grounds, a system of investiga-tion might be built up.  It will be necessary to obtain the co-operation of aviatorsand to represent to  them the  value  of  accident investiga-tion.  This co-operation should take the form of  reports by flyers not only as to mishaps, but also  as to  other unusualexperiences due  to meteorological or other causes.                           IV,THE  NECESSITY FOR  AN  EXPERT  EXAMINATION  AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE  DATA OBTAINED.  In the pre-wartsystem  the Accidents&apos;  Committee of theRoyal Aero Club and  the Aeronautical  Society,  after con-si dering a  fatality and agreeing as to its view of what  had occurred,  issued a  report.    In this report, as occasiondemanded,  the Committee drew the  attention of designers,constructors, flyers,  and others to any feature of  the report which seemed of importance for the purpose of preventing the recurrence of an accident from any cause establishedby the report.  After the war, however,  when small mishaps  as well as large  become matters  for investigation,  there should be  avolume  of  material  with  which to deal which  should  be suffiently  large to justify the establishment of a  bureau,with a permanent office and staff, for the purpose  of deal-ing with accident reports.  The officials iof this bureau couldclassify  reports,  at first roughly and then in greater detail,and accumulate  by  degrees prepared data  which should,when  examined  finally and reported on, throw a valuablelight  on the question  of accident prevention.  As  to the institution  of such a  bureau,  it would seem that much  may  be  expected from the proposed  formationby  the  aeronautical industry  of  a Research Association,which it is hoped will be aided by financial grants from theDepartment  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research,  toamplify sums obtained  from the industry.  To the research work  of this Association  might, it is submiitted, be added the work of a permanent  bureau for the.examination  andclassification of  the reports which would be  obtained fromaccident investigators.   The bureau  would have  to  be infree and constant touch  with the  industry  it served (notforgetting, of  course, that  it would also be serving thepublic), and  the industry as a  whole would be  benefitedvery  greatly and the safety  of  flying increased, if therewere  proper  access,  for  well-recognised persons and  firms!to information in regard to accidents.                   *  In  the  investigation  of small accidents  and  mishaps,which would probably form  the bulk of the work, of the bureau, each  case would, no doubt,  be classified under some special heading, without  an  individual report being  issuedconcerning it, and when  there was a sufficient number ofcases  from which to draw definite conclusions, the directorof the bureau would  issue a  memorandum.  This  would bemade  accessible  to  those engaged in the  industry,  andprobably also to tho technical and general Press.                          V.  THE  USE  TO WHICH THE RESULTS OF EXPERT             EXAMINATION CAN BE PUT.  It is necessary  to  consider what  use may be  made ofaccident reports  after   they have  been  examined  andclassified,  and are  presented  in the  form of summarisedstatistics.  In the case of engines, it is  hoped that it may be possibleto  discover,  from&apos; an  examination  and  classification  of accidents,  just  what parts   of any  particular engine orengines are proved to be  most likely  to give trouble  under certain given circumstances.  With designers  and  constructors, also,  it  should  bepossible after a sufficient amount of accident data had beenclassifiedi-to point out to them,  so far as some particularmachine was concerned, that  a weakness lay here or  there,or that the testimony of pilots was that cei&apos;tain  small im-improvements were necessary to  facilitate control.  It will be  desirable, during the  immediate post-war de-velopment of commercial flying, to secure close cooperationbetween the  makers  of  aircraft  and of  engines and theusers  of such apparatus.  Apart from accidents due,  say, to engine stoppage, therewill be others no doubt caused by errors of judgment on thepart of aviators.  In  such cases, when sufficient data havebeen obtained from which to draw conclusions the  accidentsbureau  would probably  report  to   that  branch of  the research Association  which is considering the training offlyers, and suggest improvements or modifications in tuition.It is  assumed that after the war adequate  tes*ts will beenforced1 before  a flyer is given a certificate of proficiency,and particularly that he should have had  sufficient experi-ence to enable fhimi to cope successfully with any predica-ment  which  is likely  to  arise in cross-country flying,  as distinct from aerodrome flying.  One respect in which the Accidents&apos; Bureau can help inthe general work of  research  will be  in placing before the meteorological department of the Research Association  alldata it may  be able to obtain as to the part played in anyparticular accident by the atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time.  Looking into the future, one sees that four factors, inaddition to  a,  scheme of accident  investigation, are ofimportance.   These are;     1. An increase in the number  oif alighting grounds.    2. The elimination of engine failure.    3. The careful training of flyers.    4. The forecasting of the  weather for as, long  a  period        as  possible ahead, and some  system of distributing        these iforecasts rapidly to  aerodromes throughout        the country;  also warnings of approaching weather        changes of any importance.  With all these, ,the investigation  of accidents  is  either directly or indirectly connected.
83108                                                    ANNEX.Summary  of  the  Work,  Prior to the War, of the Public Safety and^Accidents Investigation                 Committee  of the  Royal Aero  Club and  Aeronautical  Society.  In 1912 the  Royal Aero  Club, jointly  with the  Aero-nautical Society, appointed  a Special Committee known asthe Public Safety and Accidents Investigation  Committee,to obtain reports as to aeroplane accidents, and to endeavourto discover the causes of such accidents, and to express ,an opinion, whenever possible, as to how they might be avoidedin future. * Official representatives were appointed  on theprincipal aerodromes, whose  duty it was, should an accidentoccur,  to  gain  all information possible concerning  it, toexamine  the wrecked machine, and to bring  before theCommittee all the information which could be secured.  Between 1912 and 1914-when the outbreak of war inter-rupted the  work  ol the  Committee twenty-six fatalitieshad been investigated.  The main causes of accidents before the war, as shown byan examination of the Committee&apos;s reports,  were:    1. Errors  of judgment on  the part of  a flyer.  2. The structural breakage of some part of an aeroplane      while  in flight.  Nine of the  twenty-six fatalities were due to errors of judgment.  In two oases accidents  were shown to &apos;be&quot;due to a pilotattempting  a flight in a machine which was  out of adjust-ment, with the result - hat it side-slipped while  turning.  In two  others,  pilots  dived their machines  so  suddenlyand steeply  that they were  jerked forward on to their con-trols,  accentuating the  descent  to such a degree that theyfell from their machines while in tho air.  In two&apos; more  cases, the accident, was caused by a machinenose-diving, while gliding, through the pilot allowing it to lose flying speed.  The  remaining  three  cases  may   be  summarised  asfollows:    (i) A pilot was making a  series of spectacular evolutions,      low  down over an aerodrome, when his machine side-      slipped.  (ii) A pilot over-banked while turning at a low altitude,      and this  was followed  by a nose-dive.  (iii) A pilot dived steeply,  then flattened out too suddenly,      fracturing a wing.  Of accidents  due primarily to engine failure, or enginetrouble, the Committee investigated three-though it shouldbe noted that,  in  each case, and subsequent  to  the troublowith his engine, the flyer  was guilty of  some error of judg-ment.  These cases&quot; are summarised herewith :   (i) A pilot&apos;s engine was  observed to stop when he  was at      an altitude of about 200 feet.  Shortly afterwards the      machine nose-dived.   In the Committee^ opinion, the      accident  was due  to the aviator failing to appreciate      the danger of keeping  his craft in  a horizontal position      after  the engine  had stopped, thereby losing  flying      speed.                                          7  &apos;i (ii) A  pilot, finding his engine running badly after leaving      an aerodrome, turned in  the air  in order to fly back      to his starting point;  but in making the turn he lost      speed and altitude to a dangerous extent, and while      passing low near a belt of trees,  which may have set      up disturbed air in the neigfibourhood of his machine,      the craft was seen to  dive.(iii) A pilot attempted a flight with an  engine that was not      working  properly,  with the result that the machine      gradually lost altitude until it fell into a river.  Eight of the  twenty-six  accidents investigated were shown to be due to the breakage of some part of a machine.  these may he summarised as follows:    (i) A  quick-release device  of a wing-cable opened  and the     cable came adrift, flapping up and piercing the fabric      of a wing, which then burst and allowed  the machine      to fall. (ii) An aircraft collapsed  in  flight through  the  breakage      of  the wires supporting a wing,  following upon some      derangement of the cabane, this derangement being      due either to a portion of the revolving  engine fouling      the engine cowl, or by a partial failure  or breakage of      the  propeller, which threw the rotating system  out of       balance, and  set up stresses which caused the engine       to shift.  (iii) The wings of  an aircraft collapsed while .the machine       was flying in an extremely high wind.  (iv) An elevating  plane broke and allowed  a  machine to       dive so steeply that the main planes collapsed.   (v) A wing broke as the result of a faulty repair to a main-       spar.  (vi) A wing failed, owing to want of sufficient strength to       withstand the stresses produced  either by  a violent       wind or sudden warping.  (vii) An aircraft collapsed while in flight owing to inherent       structural weakness. (viii) A rudder became detached from  a machine  in flight       owing (in the  opinion of the Committee) to  its being       insufficiently  strong to resist a sudden  and abnormal       strain, and owing also to the fact  that it had probably       been strained  in a previous flight.   In connection with accidents due to  structural weakness, the Committee  made two recommendations.   One  was that, as aircraft are  built of perishable materials, all machines which have been in existence for some time should undergo a critical examination, both as regards framework and fabric.   The  second  recommendation  was that all  repairs  to  a machine must be carried  out under expert and responsible supervision.  As to the remaining six accidents, making up the total of twenty-six, their causes are summarised below :    (i) The pilot of an experimental machine lost control  in a       gusty wind.  (ii) A pilot ascended while  in an unfit  state of health, and       apparently lost  consciousness  while his machine was       gliding. (iii) A pilot lost control through his  foot slipping on the       rudder-bar. (iv) A  pilot who  was giving a public demonstration on an       aerodrome of insufficient size turned sharply to avoid       endangering  spectators,  with  the result  that his       machine side-slipped from a low altitude.  (v) A  pupil, Hying  with an instructor in  a dual-control       machine, appeared to resist for some unknown reason       the ruddering action  of the latter, with the result  that       the machine became uncontrollable. (vi) A pilot who was landing, and whose view was obstructed     &apos;  to some extent by his radiator, ran into some  people       who had encroached  on the  flying ground,  with the       result that one person was killed and several injured.   The  Committee  found it necessary,  in its endeavour to determine the causes of accidents,  to request local authori- ties, in cases where aircraft fell in open country, to prevent the wreckage of the machine being moved until it had been examined by experts, and this wiirassureclly have to be car- ried out after the war.                     FINAL NOTE.   Looking at pre-war accidents in the light of conditions  such as  will exist, probably, when peace comes, one very appreci- able element of risk, that  of structural collapse,  should be eliminated almost entirely.   This being so, we  find that what we  shall have left,  as a main risk of accident, will be engine failure, followed perhaps by an error of judgment on the part of the  flyer.   To lessen this risk we must, of course, perfect our aero-engines, and eliminate by degrees those  small causes of stoppage, or of trouble,  which (insignificant in  themselves)  may lead none the less to a serious accident.   It should be noted again that, when an aviator who encounter- ters engine trouble has a chain  of alighting  grounds along his flying route, he will be far less likely to find himself in a critical position; also  that, when we have the comparative leisure of peace in which to train flyers more carefully, and also more scientifically, they should be less likely to be guilty of errors of judgment.
