(Dr*Macn&amp;foara&apos;              Memorandum,  .G.T t  6775)*     The Pay Warrant of&apos; the Army (Art .497)  iaye down that ,  while a Temporary Officer employed in War gets a gratuity df 124  days&apos;pay for tho first year (or part of a year)  of his fervioe,  and 62days1 pay for each subskqu^nt year or part  of a yoar; a recalled ;retired officer&apos;gcta only 31.days&apos; pay for each year.or part  of ayear,   Such an Officer&apos; continues to draw his retired pay inaddiiion to his full pay,     Tho War Gratuity ari&amp;Lnally contemplated by the War Office  .for soldiers and for Regular Officers was (as in the S.--Af ricari.War) a fixed sum for each rank;  but the War Office was asked bythe Chairman of tha Soldiers.&apos;1 and Sailors&apos;&apos; Pay Committee1 to  prepare a schome giving increments for the length of servide, 6n thelines oi&quot; Art, 4-9.7 of the Pay Warrant.,   In laying this schemebefore the Commit too attention was;&apos;drawn to the fact that: the pensioner who draws pension in addition to pay stands in the  same position as the t&amp;i&amp;a&amp;y  ,mo draws retired pay in addition to  fullpay, and a reduced increment had accordingly been assigned tosuch pensioners.     Under the Pay Warranty the pensioner is liable, to forfeithis pension if he fails to come up for Home Service when calledupon, up to the age of 50, just as Officers on retired pay ar^liable to duty up to certain ages.   The policy of the Committeehas be en-throughout to assimilate, as opportunity admitted, thetreatment oi&quot; officers and men,. and it was felt by the Committee,&apos;after full discussion, that if the re-enlisted pensioner received .the full gratuity over and above his pension plus pay, there-wnuldbe no logical reply to tho recalled retired officer who migltclaim the full scale of.Art, 497-   This would Involve a very&quot;.large sum, many of the officers concerned being of senior rank;but there are no data readily available for an estimate;    t.     ;The Admiralty was consequently instructed to follow thesame principle.     With reference to the Admiralty memo; to the War cabinet .T,67B0., in which a point is made.of the faot that the treatmentsof Officers and men is still in certain respects not identical,  Lthe reply is that it has not been proposed to tear up existing regulations such as Art * 497? with the-inevitable -result of stillfurther increasing the payments under it if Home were differentiateed from Foreign Service;  but that where new regulations have hadto.be made, Officers and men should where possible be treated on similar principles.WAR OFFICE.    12th February, 1919.
