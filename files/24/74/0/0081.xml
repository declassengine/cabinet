WAR0 A B I&apos; B&apos; 11 T;2        Propeaoct^ Industrial  Enquiry.(Memorandum by the  Minister  of Reconstruction).1,6779.     I with to suggest that a special enquiry into thepresent state of Industry in this country should bo immed-lately started, and concluded with the least possible delay.     I do not think that this enquiry could bo oitherrapid or.effective in present circumstances, if it wereentrusted to a Joint Committee or Commission on the ordinarylines, on which the employers, and workpeople were equallyrepresented, and I suggest that I should, as Minister of reconstruction, immediately appoint three Committees withidentical Terms pf Reference, one composed of represents-tiVes of all sections of labour opinion, the second of re-presentatlvos of employers, the third a body of Sechnicalexperts in Economics ond Finance to study the questions a tissue from a National standpoint.-     If these enquiries are promptly carried out,- theresults will be of great value to the Government in workingmt the programme of Social and Industrial reconstruction and I believo that the immediate effect on public opinionwill be good.  . The Terms of Reference might be to enquire into:-1.  The conditions of employment of tho workers,2. - The means by which the workers may he assured    of an adequate return for their labour,-o.  The basis on whioh the workers should partici-    pate in the control of conditions governing    industrial life.arid to make practical suggestions for dealing with thesequestions.A.C,GEKD S.
