       In considering  the  probable  effoeta upon industry of the  &quot;outbreak of peace&quot;  the  Trade Unions generally for some consideration-  We  time before  the  end  of  the war  bad given attention to the  reduction in the usual hours of labour aa a moana of absorbing  workpeople who would temporarily perhape bs thrown out of work as  a remit of  the  demobilisation of the army and the munitionj workers.   In addition to this general idea of a reduction inj hours,  the movement for  shorter hours in the engineering and ship-j building  trades, which had been dropped upon tho outbreak of war,  was  resuscitated during  1918, and the railwayman^ national  programme, in which tho  main plank was the 6 hour day,  had been  for  some  years past given great prominence at msetinga  of the man,      The  railwayman had  secured what thoy considered a  premiss  of consideration of their programme uton the cessation  of war, and  very shortly after the signature of the aroietice they  approached  the Government successfully for the concession of an G-hour  Asy,  The actual introduction of the shorter day was postponed until 1st. February 1919,  to permit of tho necessary arrangements  being made by the lailway Companies.   This was followed  towards the end of December by the national agreement for the  47-hour  week  in the-Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades.                             -  ,             *   S, &quot; &apos;                                              .*      The success of these two bodies of men, combined with the long-mooted notion that a reduction in hours would  be necessary in.order to absorb the  workpeople  thrown  out of work following demobilisation,  stimulated other&quot;organised  classes  of labour te prefer similar  Claims,  Moreover,  the  Cisputea which broke dfgfc at  the beginning  of January  in  the engineering abopa and shipyards consequent upon  the introduction of  the 47-hour week rivotted the attention of  labour upon  the  hours question.      The result has been  that in practically all tho important industries claims for reductions in  hours of labour have been putforward  either alone or accompanied by demands for adTonses in wages, and  gently by olaims for annual holidays of a week or two weeks, without loss of pay.   &quot;*  /The  iners&apos;  Federation of Great Britain has put forward a claim on behalf of  the Coal Miners for a 6-hour working day.  Itis to be/noted that miners1 hours have always been lower than theseusual in moat other trade  and it follows therefore that thereduction  in hours in other trades is bound to  lead to a si aimby the Miners that their  hours should also be shortened.     In  Scotland a movement is on foot apparently with the baokingof the Scottish Trade Union Congress, for  a 40-hour week for  alltrades in Scotland,   The movement originated tn the Clyde, andthe Clyde Workers1 Committee have had a hand in the organisingof the movement,   In tho building trade at London and Glasgowa claim is also being put forward for a 40-hour week.     In the 3arge majority of cases,  however, the hours  asked for  &apos;range from 44 to 48 per  week.  This would  inolude  the whole of theTransport, General and Textile Workers together  with the sectionof the engineering and shipyard  workers which is pressing for theioneeasion of their original  demand.                                             /The
        The trades in which reduced hours have already been conceded,   besides the engineers, shipyard workers and railwayman IncMo   worlonen engaged in the electrical contracting industry (47-hour   week) coal mining surface workers and Scottish mineral oil   workers (40 hours) Iron and Steel trades (8-hour  day,) tinplateA making (daemon, a 47 hour rock),  silk industry (49  hours).  A very   large number of cases havo been reported in which individual  firms   have granted shorter working weeks.   Aa instances may be quoted   ford^ Motor Works,  where a 40-bour  week has been introduced,   B,  Hooa Haggio and Sons (wire and hemp rope manufacturers) who   have started a 44-hour week, and  0.Aganderveil (Motor Aocessoriea)   whore a ballot of the firm^ employees resulted in  an agreement for   a 47-hour week.                          SCOTTISH MOTOWN        A demand  for a  40-hour  we SIR,? originating  in tho  engineering   shop&amp; and shipyards  on tfca Clyde, hes  been  widely advertised to   have spread  so as to  cover all  trades  in Scotlando    The aim of  rthe movement is to absorb  the men unemployed  through demobilisation.  ;Mq Glasgow  Munioipal  Worters and the  Firth of Forth Engineering  ,r jp Shipbuilding  operatives  havo adhered to tho niovomeit,  but  /fofceur  opinion in Eaigbursfh  is  reported to be adverse.  Unless  4FCE demand is  conceded  the men  have intimated that they will  ^iease work on  Monday 87th January,                          BUILDING TRADES.       On 14th January it was reported in the press that the  -Loinon District Council of the National federation of Building  Trade Operatives was putting forward a demand for a 40-hour  working week.  Somewhat later, an exactly similar  demand was  reported to  have been made by Scottish building trade operatives.   This was some time before the geroral movement in Scotland for  a  40-hour week began.       The Joint Industrial Council for tba Electrical Contracting  Industry which met for the first time on 2 nd January decided  to establish for the industry a uniform working week of 47 hours,  .  payablb on a basis of 53-hour week,  to come into force at  the end o* January or beginning of Pebruary.                           MINING,  Coal Mining.       The Miners&apos; Federation of Groat  Britain have  inoclu&amp;ed a  6-hour day in their programme.       By a national agreement to which the men*s unions, the  employers and the Coal Controller  are parties, the hours of  surfacemen  have been reduced  to 49 per week  ezclusiva  of meal  timesjjj  The  Derbyshire  Miners Association,  however,  have foroed the coal  owners in tha\ district to agree,  under protest, to  a  49-hour  week inclusive  of meal/times.  Oil  Workers.       The Scottish Mineral dil Workers havo  succeeded in obtaining  a reduction  in  weekly hours of labour from 64 to 49  par week*                                   *  Inglnseriitt and Shipbuilding  Trades.

? Metal Trades.

It should be noted that the National agreement between the Engineering and Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the men&apos;s Federation covers more than the engineering and shipbuilding Trades proper. The amalgamation between the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation and the National Employers&apos; Federation has resulted in a number of the smaller metal industries such as the nut and bolt industry being brought under the agreement. (In this particular industry a dispute has arisen in the Darlaston area upon the question of the readjustment of piece prices following the introduction of the 47-hour week).

TEXTILE TRADES.

Cotton (Lancashire).

The Cotton operatives have not yet put forward a specific demand for a shorter working week. Steps are, however, being taken to crystallize the currents of opinion among the workpeople, and it is believed that the majority will favour a 46-hour week. The present weekly working hours are 55\\1//2.

Silk.

The Joint Industrial Council for the Silk Industry, representing employers and workpeople, have come to an agreement for a reduction in hours to 49 per week. The charge is to come into operation in the first full working week in February.

Linen etc.

The Textile Operative Workers&apos; Union, embracing the majority of the women textile workers in Ireland, are demanding a 44-hour working week with full pay. The full week at present is 55 hours, but the mills are enorganised short time and actually working 47 hours only.

TRANSPORT AND GENERAL WORKERS.

Railwaymen.

The principle of an 8-hour day has already been conceded in the/

   
? cases of traffic men. The actual application of the principle ? postponed until 1st February in order to ? the railway companies to make the necessary arrangements. ? accounts which appeared in the press of 22nd January it seemed that the railwaymen are dissatisfied with the way the arrangements are being carried out. It was reported in the press of 11th January that platelayers ? the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway had drawn up a programme which included a 36-hour week. No further mention, however, appears have been made of this.

The Railway Clerks Association, claiming not only on/clerks ? also of stationmasters, inspectors, &amp;c., has included in its programme a demand for a 38-hour week for day workers and 34-hour week for night workers.

In Railway workshops the men are working the 47-hour week of ? Engineering trades.

? and Motormen.

The Employers&apos; Association, individual employers, Harbour Authorities, &amp;c in the country to whom ? application was addressed number about two hundred.

General Workers.

At a Conference of the National Federation of General Workers ? 23rd January it was resolved that the Federation should forward ? application for a 44-hours week to all federations of employers, and in cases where no such federation exists to individual employers. ? industries where the ? system exists the hours shall be arranged ? most the circumstances of each industry. An important point was ? of the fact that, apart from the general feeling in favour of a reduction in hours, the hours in industry should be so arranged so as ? absorb with ? demobilised soldiers and sailors.

The membership of the Unions affiliated to the National Federation ? General Workers amounts to nearly a million.

Tramwaymen.

One of the claims upon which the men are negotiating with the Municipal Tramways Association and the Tramways and Light Railways Association is for a 44-hour week. At Belfast the tramwaymen have obstructed their officials to take steps to obtain a 44-hour week.

Canal Workers.
