Previous Reports carried the history of the  movement generally connected with theactivities of Shop Stewards roughly down to the date of the Armistice.  During the period between that date and the present, however, there has been a considerable amount of activity of some- significance, and accordingly it may be useful to make some  further reference to this matter.    Taking the movement in its national, aspect first, it will be remembered that at aNational Conference  held at Birmingham in  September, the national organisation was discussed, and proposals made to issue membership cards and levy a subscription of Id.a month.  The active members hoped thus to put the movement on a sound financial basis, and to raise  enough money  to  run  a  full-time  Secretary.  On  the NationalAdministrative  Council elected  at this conference  were Arthur MacManus, President;George Peet,  Secretary;  J. T. Murphy,  Assistant  Secretary;  and David Ramsay,Treasurer.  Four  regional divisions were marked off Scotland,  the North of England,the Midlands, and the South  of  England,  with  two or  three representatives each.W. F. Watson (London) and Tom Dingley (Coventry)  were representatives of Londonand the Midlands respectively.  Resolutions demanding the withdrawal of Allied troops
 from Russia, and declaring the sympathy of  the Conference with the Soviet Republic were passed ; also resolutions demanding the release of John MacLean and Tom Mooney, Thus, although maintaining that the basis of the organisation is the  workshop and that all matters  of policy are referable directly to the individual members, the N.A.C. has entered definitely into the  political  sphere and functions  as a political as well  as  an industrial organisation.  This is shown clearly in the  Preamble to the London Workers&apos; Committee published in October and mentioned below.     Two members of the N.A.C., Arthur MacManus and J; T. Murphy,  stood as candidates at the General Election.  They were put forward by the  Socialist Labour Party with which  MacManus  is closely connected.   MacManus opposed Mr.  J.  H. Whitley in. the Halifax Division, and Murphy was put up in the Gorton Division of  Manchester against Mr.  John Hodge.  Both were  defeated  at the Polls.  MacManus&apos;  Election manifesto of &quot; 14 points &quot; is an interesting document, and contains  probably  a summary of the general policy of the national shop stewards movement so  far as this is sufficiently co- ordinated to be said to have a policy.  The &quot; points &quot; include the nationalisation of the whole transport system and &quot; all other instruments of  Social Service the abolition of Social  Classes,  and  the transferring  of  all governing  power from  the  Parliamentary legislative institution  to   the   Federal  Congress  of  People&apos;s  Administrative Council composed of delegates from the Toiling Masses.&quot;  The 14th point states that the Workers&apos; Industrial Republic when it is established will  stand for the complete self-determination of nations and the Federation of the Socialist  Republics of the  World.  This manifestoshows the extent to which Russian developments have influenced the so-called extremistsin England, arid  is evidence that  the Shop Stewards Movement possesses a President who thinks in terms of political power which, however, is to be based securely on industrial organisation.     The National Administrative Council held a meeting in London on  17th  January, 1919, and considered the recommendation of the Birmingham Conference in September that a national,membership card should be issued. Apparently a good many districts had been asking when these would appear,  and it was decided to print 70,000 cards having the structure and principles  of the Workers Committee on them.  The meeting also dis- cussed the advisability of running a paper, but decided  that it  would be necessary first to find out whether the districts would support  a paper financially and contribute articles to it.  All members were advised to make use  of such papers as already exist and  give a column to the Shop Stewards movement. These include &quot; The Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; -London; the&quot; Socialist &quot; ; the &quot; Clyde Worker &quot; ;  and the &quot; Sheffield Worker.&quot; Dealing with a request  from the London Workers Committee  that  a- national conference should be convened to consider the question of a shorter  working week, the meeting decided that where any  Shop Stewards&apos;  or Workers&apos; Committee has  organised a strike on this matter the N.A.C. should  immediately be called together with  a view to summoning a general strike of  all their members.  The news of the proposed strikes in Glasgow and at the  Port of London determined the members to meet  again on 19th January, but the arrangement was cancelled by the  departure of MacManus  for Glasgow.   It is not  very certain how far the central organisation has operated in  the present strikes, but the district organisations have undoubtedly taken an important part and  have probably more influence than the N.A.C. could hope to have unless some very widespread disturbance were produced which required a central directing body to run it.     Of the local organisations, one of the most important at present is the London Workers&apos; Committee.  Since W. E. Watson became an active member of  the Shop  Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos;  Committee movement, he has devoted his energies to  working up the London organisation. In October he announced at a meeting that all strikes in the  London area would, in future, have the support of the London Workers&apos; Committee. The Constitution and  Rules of this were published in the same-month, the  Objects being as follows :      (1)  To work for the  overthrow  of  the  Wage System and the establishment  of          Industrial Democracy;     (2) To obtain an ever  increasing  control over  workshop conditions;     (3) To regulate the terms upon which workers shall be employed.     (4) To organise the workers upon a  class  basis, and to maintain the Class struggle          until the freedom of  the workers has been  gained.     The Committee covers  the London  workers in the Shipbuilding and Engineering Industry.   The preamble to its rules states the necessity for a regular unofficial organisation since the official Trade Unions are defective in  structure and fail to meet effectively the needs of the times.&quot;  W. F. Watson became the President of the Committee, and apparently placed what machinery there was left  of the defunct Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding
Amalgamation Committee at the disposal of his new organisation.  He has carried on astrenuous propaganda, to form a Shop Stewards co-ordinating hody in London and bringtogether  the committees  springing up in different districts.  After some delay this wasgot going in December  as &quot; The London and  District  Council of Shop Stewards  and workers&apos; Committees &apos;&apos; Watson being elected President, and F. J. Pateman,  Secretary.One of the efforts  made  by the London Committee to wake in their members a  feeling of solidarity  was a Rebels&apos; Dinner held at the Old Bell Inn, Holborn, in November.MacManus  presided, and Watson who spoke  said  that  the London  workers were  nowready for the Class  war amd prepared to institute a Soviet Government.  It is worth notingthat R. Smillie, President of the Miners&apos; Federation,  addressed a telegram to this gatheringregretting his absence and strongly supporting its objects.  &quot; It was  impossible for himto be present,&quot; he said, &quot; as he was&apos; speaking to the men at Blackburn . . . for the purposeof urging them to  utterly refuse to recognise a coalition Government and at  once formthe Soviet  Workers Government as the time  is  now arriving for  the  workers  to controltheir own destiny.&apos; &quot;  The London Workers&apos;  Committee also initiated the &quot;  Hands offRussia &quot; movement, and convened the meeting of Labour  and Socialist organisationsat the Memorial Hall on 18th January at which 158 organisations were represented by300  delegates, and a resolution was carried to the  effect that active  agitation would becarried on to unite Labour opinion on the Russian question, so that at a future conference a general strike  would be declared if the withdrawal of Allied troops had not yet takenplace.     The East London organisation known as  TJie River Thames Shi])  Repairers shop stewards&apos; Committee was also the  outcome  of  Watson&apos;s propaganda.  Formed aboutfifteen weeks ago it has a membership of 12,000 and under the leadership  of Harry Pollittis the moving force behind the strike of Ship Repairers which began at the end of January.     It may be remarked that the London Workers&apos; Committee has central offices offHolborn,. that  it  holds  a business meeting  once  a month and uses   the columns  of miss Pankhurst&apos;s paper,  the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; for propaganda  and news of themovement.  W. F. Watson is avowedly against official  trade unionism  and an admirerof the Soviet form of government.  With David Ramsay, Harry Pollitt  and A. Penderyto back him it is possible that he may succeed  in making  the London Workers&apos; committee as notorious as the.Clyde Workers&apos; Committee became in 1916.     With regard to the movement on the Clyde nothing of importance occurred untilthe 47-Hours Agreement was signed.  The discontent created by the interpretation of thisagreement  ended in a declaration by the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee that they were nowin favour of a 30-Hours Week consisting of five days of six hours each, with a  holiday  on saturday and a minimum wage of  1  a day.  .A Joint Committee was formed  withrepresentatives of  the Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress,the  Glasgow Trades and Labour  Council, the District Committees of Engineering, Ship-building and Allied Trades, the Clyde Labourers and  other Trade Unions.   This Committeecirculated  a  manifesto calling on the  workers  to  demand a 40-hour week.   Gallacher,Neil MacLean, Shinwell and others were appointed to visit different parts of the countryand state the position on the Clyde, before the strike took place on 27th January.     Recent developments connected with the Shop Stewards&apos;movement in other districtscan be reviewed more briefly.     The Miners&apos; Unofficial Reform Committee  in Wales issued a programme of 11 points in October, demanding among other things one  organisation for the entire mining industry, a 6-hour day, a 5-days week, and facilities for holidays with pay.   The unofficial movementin Manchester^as  represented by the Mersey Reconstruction Committee, is  apparently one of the few which tends to join hands with the official trade unions in the Engineering and Shipbuilding Industry.   After the Armistice was signed, meetings were held at winch apprehension was  expressed  as to the  general situation.  It was thought that the Shop Steward movement would tend to collapse in the absence  of war conditions to make employers dread a dispute.   Manchester in  any case  has never been  quite so closely connected with the general movement as other centres, but several rank and file conferenceshave been held there, and Percy Kealey has been one of the active members  of the movement as a Manchester delegate to Conferences.  The Sheffield movement has  continued to be active during the period  under review.   J. T.  Murphy, President of the Sheffield Workers&apos; Committee, became the Assistant Secretary  of the National Administrative  Council of Shop Stewards and Workers&apos;  Committee.   A demonstration was  organised with the workers Socialist Federation  and the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers in  October.   In connection with this, a circular was issued on the problem of the Discharged Soldier, urging the workers and soldiers to unite in a fight for better conditions into a Soldiers&apos; and Workers&apos; Council.  Murphy has lately published a
pamphlet called &quot; Compromise or Independence,&quot; which is  &quot; a plea for  the rejection of the Whitley Report&apos;s Proposals for Joint Standing Industrial Councils.&quot;  In CoventryTom Dingley has been made general organiser of the Shop Stewards&apos; movement and haskept the organisation in that  district going.  A. pamphlet written by him called &quot; the shop Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committee Movement,&quot; throws a good deal of light on the structure and principles governing the Workers&apos; Committees, and  on  their relationship to official organisations.    The developments summarised above seem to show that on the industrial side the typeof ad hoc organisation formed in the Workshop  with no great  stability of constitution orfunction, but founded on a certain steadiness of principle, i.e., that no elected body hasexecutive powers, all questions  of policy being referred  to the rank  and  file, must  on occasion be reckoned with as a serious force.  It undoubtedly owes  something to themovement in  favour of greater  &quot; control&quot; now manifesting itself  so  strongly in many quarters;  but its main opportunity for development has arisen from the discontent of the rank and file with the functioning of the official machinery under the extra strain imposed by the war, and this is a matter which the advent of peace probably has tended, at anyrate temporarily, rather to aggravate than to allay. Peace conditions have meant thedeprival of the Government of one of its strongest weapons for the maintenance of industrialpeace the plea of war necessity for its actions while not relaxing, but rather increasing,the strain upon the official Trade Union machinery owing to the immense number of newproblems raised.  In any case it seems clear that the rank and file, at any rate in the greatnational industries, having previously become educated up to the idea of complete organisa-tion of some kind, are now becoming capable of giving collective expression to a preference for one form of machinery over another.  If this is so, it means that the Government hasthe strongest interest in encouraging efficient Trade Union machinery, since in the absenceof such machinery, the rank and file seeking for  some more adequate means of  expressionwill always be open to suggestion from irresponsible  leaders whose only power  may be tocreate trouble.  This fact of the grave consequences which may arise from inefficiencyin Trade Union machinery in the present stage of  development is well illustrated in anotherdirection by the two most recent disputes among railway workers.  In both of these cases a good deal of extra difficulty would appear to have been caused by the unsatisfactoryrelationship existing between two of the main unions  concerned.  In a similar way troublehas been caused, and may be caused again, through the unsatisfactory relations subsisting[ii the mining industry between underground workers and surface workers.&apos;                         PART II.-PRESS COMMENTS.                          (1)  Labour  and Socialist Press.                               (A) Peace Conference.    The Peace Conference is little discussed this week, the problem of the German Coloniesreceiving.most attention.  Mr.  J. Ramsay Macdonald hv&quot; Forward &quot; is optimistic,  and.considers that our delegates are working with the Americans on. an I.L.P. programme.He mentioned, however, as George Lansbury didlast week,that one of the greatest obstaclesthe people at the Peace Conference feel is English public opinion.  Mr. Brailsford, in the&quot; Herald,&quot; again appeals  to Labour to press for the inclusion of Germany in the League ofNations. Her exclusion  will mean the perpetuation of the  Paris Resolutions;  shortageof raw material for Germany ; protection for our manufacturers against German imports,and the continuance of the old profiteering prices in this country.  The alleged reason forthus penalising Germany is that she destroyed  the manufacturing prosperity of  certain of the Allied towns (for which reparation must certainly be given), but we are going to use this excuse as a lever to capture the world market. .German Colonies.                        -    The &quot; Herald &quot; thinks that the  debate on  the German Colonies was an undoubtedvictory  for President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George, but it seems clear that France wouldhave preferred direct annexations.  It rests entirely  with the people to see that  themandatory system does not merely become a cloak for the old games of profiteering  and
exploitation.   Most of the other papers referring to this subject, including the &quot; labour leader &quot; and. the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; take up a more suspicious attitude.  In the words of the &quot; Call&quot; the mandatory system is merely a veil to liide the establishment of a per-manent occupation in the interests of the various Great Powers.The Berne Conference.    George Lansbury, in the  &quot; Herald,&quot;  reviews the many obstacles which have beenput in the way of the Internationale.  He thinks the most serious is the fact that several of the British delegates were called to the  Conference in Paris with Mr. Barnes, to discussthe subject of Labour legislation.  These delegates will thereby be placed in  an awkwardposition if they have already  agreed to anything in the Government scheme which theInternationale rejects.    The I.L.P. papers support the Conference.  It is repudiated by the British SocialistParty (&quot; Call&quot;) since it is composed of those who continue to uphold Capitalist Govern-ments,  and &quot; Justice &quot; says : &quot; Nothing  shows more clearly how justified has been ouropposition than the paucity of the delegates attending &quot; ;  while the speeches of MessieursBranting,  A. Thomas and P.  Renaudel,  justify to the full the attitude  of the pro-AllySocialists.                                   (B) Foreign.Russia.     The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks that the Prinkopo proposal will fail since the reaction-aries refuse to be present.  Their very refusal, however, is an admission of the weakness oftheir case and a confession that their purpose is to establish reaction throughout Russia.                                 (C)-Home Affairs. Industrial Unrest.     Descriptions  of the recent strikes  and explanations favourable  to the workers  even in those papers which denounce the Bolshevist element-occupy most of the space this week.  &quot; Justice,&quot;, for example, thinks that the Bolsheviks would have no influence whatever  if the ground had not been prepared for them beforehand by long-continued neglect of abominable social conditions.   The &quot; Herald &quot; sums up Lahour&apos;s demands in large type as :       &quot; No Conscription;  Discharge,  Not Demobilisation;  Full Maintenance for   all          Unemployed;  A 40-Hour Week without Reduction of  [Earnings;  National-          isation, with Workers&apos; Control  of Mines, Railways and Transport; Full Recog-          nition of  all  Workers&apos; Trade  Unions;  Restoration of  Trade Union  Rights;          Amnesty for all Political Prisoners ;  Self-Government in Industry ; Fulfilment          of all Government Pledges ; No Further Use of Military in Industrial Disputes ;          and Hands Off Russia.&quot;      The &quot; Call &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; think that the present unrest is only a prelude  to far more serious trouble  which will  begin when unemployment becomes widespread  and attempts are made to reduce wages.   The &quot; Call &quot; urges the continuance of the guerilla  warfare to  end Capitalism.      The  opinion is widely held that official Trade Unionism must be reconstructed to meet  the  new  conditions.  According  to  the &quot;Herald&quot; it  must now be based on  industry  instead of craft, and delegates are to be drawn from the workshops.   The failure of the  Trade Unions is principally owing to their lack of constructive policy, as was amply proved  by the results of the 47 hours&apos; negotiations.   (In this case it is pointed out that the  men  were asked to choose.between 47 hours and the longer number of hours previously worked.)  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; states that the Trade Unions  must officially make up their minds  whether  they  will merely be instruments for palliating the evils  of the wage system, or  whether they are to be organised for the purpose of overthrowing Capitalism and instituting  self-government in industry ; the latter is already the declared aim of the Labour Party..  In the meantime &quot;Forward &quot; believes that the British workman who is not an extremist   as the history of the war and the General Election have shown is not prepared to scrap  his Trade Union as long as the alternative held out to him is only a theory.      The &quot;.Herald&quot;  notes the friendliness and solicitude of  the  Government for official   Trade Unionism in times of acute unrest.  This feeling sinks into oblivion directly order  is   restored.  According   to &quot; Justice&quot; the Government^ policy  of  non-intervention  is   explained by the fact that the industrial unrest is bound, sooner or later, to inflict serious   injury on the mass of the British workers, and then sufficiently hostile public opinion will   have been created to support any drastic means  of  suppression the Government may   contemplate.
  Army of Occupation.      The size of the Army of Occupation is looked upon with grave suspicion.  In the  u Labour Leader &quot; its large proportions when the probable contributions from other  Allies are added is taken to imply that the terms of settlement are to be of such a character  that they will be unwillingly tolerated by the Central Powers.  The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot;  anticipates that whatever danger there may  be of a  fresh outbreak of war it  will be  increased by the presence of a large army of occupation in  Germany.  The &quot;  Labour  Leader,&quot; the &quot; Call&quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; see that a large standing army  will mean the continuance of conscription, and  will be used to defeat strikers at home  and to fight Socialism abroad.  The New Demobilisation Scheme.      According to the &quot; Herald &quot; the &quot; Folkestone affair &quot; and the beginnings of organisa-  tion in the Army and Navy are the undoubted causes of the new demobilisation scheme.  This has one fatal flaw-that it is based on conscription, when everywhere the feeling is  growing  that conscription was  a war measure.  The Army is  believed to be looking to  the Labour Party to put up a  big fight on that issue as soon  as Parliament opens.   In  the  opinion of the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; the old scheme  broke down because the soldiers  asserted  themselves  as men and refused to be kept in  stock, to be handed out as they  were wanted.  The  paper declares  that the  Right to  Work must be established, and  men whose work was taken from them  must now have it restored. .  It is believed that  if this right were enforced it would itself make Parliament and employers more anxious  to obtain raw materials  and restore international trade.  Conscientious Objectors.      The  &quot; Labour Leader &quot; contains long articles appealing for the release of conscientious  objectors, written by E.  D. Morel, Israel Zangwill and  Bertrand Russell. Other  contri-  foutors on the subject include Miss Maude Royden and Professor L. T. Hobhouse. The  New Parliament.     The  &quot;Herald&quot;  asserts  that the constitutional method is upon its last trial.   It complains that three days were wasted in getting members sworn in, while outside thousands of workers were walking to their homes wondering why the Government did not do something.  It should be obvious that workers do not strike for the love of striking. Hitherto  Governments have avoided all  legislation that was not absolutely  forced upon them;  this  secret the workers  have discovered  and are applying the lessons. Now is the time  for those who believe in constitutional methods to prove their effectiveness.                  (2) Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.    There appears to be  little reference to demobilisation in the daily press again this week. ^Employment  Benefit.    The  &quot; Birmingham Post&quot; (6th February) reports that the Nottingham  Chamber  of Commerce has decided to ask the Labour Minister to reduce women&apos;s out-of-work benefits to  1 a week to lessen the incentive to idleness.    A flourishing toy factory at Shillelagh (Ireland) has  been obliged to close down, says&quot;The Times &quot; (7th February), owing to the lack of labour ;  and this is attributed entirely to the unemployment donation. &quot;Employment Outlook.    The  increasing unemployment, which is further  aggravated by  demobilisation,  is reported in the &quot; Sheffield Telegraph &quot; (3rd February) to be causing a good deal of unrestin the Sheffield engineering trade.  Burnley, in proportion to  its population, is  statedin the &quot; Liverpool Post&quot; (5th February) to have the largest number of genuine unemployed workers of any town,  and there is no prospect of improvement.   The &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot;i(6th February) states that the Master and Operative Spinners&apos; Associations have agreedthat all operatives serving  with the Forces shall be reinstated in their former&apos; employment, and &quot; employers shall be  tolerant until the workers have had time to become efficientagain.&quot;                                                     -
                 PART III. GENERAL TOPICS AND DISTRICT REPORTS.                                     (A) General.  Industrial Unrest.      Two main points appear to be emphasised by  the daily papers in their comments on  industrial unrest this week;  the first one is that  the obscurity and ambiguity of Trade  Union agreements is largely responsible for the present confusion; &quot; The Times,&quot; which  is the principal exponent of this idea, hopes that as a result of the recent outbreaks, coming  negotiations  (with the Railwaymen&apos;s and Miners&apos;  Unions)  and the restoration of Trade  Union rules,  will be kept more  carefully within&apos; constitutional lines. Secondly, several  of the papers deplore the evident rivalry between Mr. Bromley&apos;s and Mr. Thomas&apos; unions  as demonstrated during the strike of the tube motormen. The &quot; Daily Mail,&quot; the &quot; Daily  News &quot; and  the &quot; Daily Chronicle &quot; approved the Governments firm action, as did the  &quot; Morning Post,&quot; but the latter added that the Defence of the Realm Regulation dealing  with the electricians&apos; strike, must be recognised to he an emergency measure only.   VM      Various  reasons  are advanced in explanation of the unrest.   The &quot; Daily News &quot;  gives prominence to the present dislocation of the industrial system and anxiety as to the  future ; the &quot; Morning Post &quot; holds Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and other defeated candidates  responsible.  &quot;The Times &quot; asserts that the present unrest is the beginning of the conflict-  which was prophesied to follow after the industrial troubles of  1913  and which was only  postponed by the war. &quot; We are already passing through a social revolution.  The Labour  questions of the moment are part  of the confused and half-conscious aspirations which  imply a tremendous clash of  interests.&quot;  Referring to  the policy to be adopted by the  Government, according to &quot; The Times&quot; the chief business is to keep alive the workmen&apos;s  faith in constitutional methods.  The &quot; Daily News &quot; adds,  that the Government  must  show that they  have a satisfactory Labour policy and mean to carry it through, one  main  cause  of Labour&apos;s attitude being the exasperation of disappointed hopes.  Individual Views on Labour Unrest.      Mr. J. II. Thomas, speaking on 9th February, and Mr. Clynes, speaking on 7th February,.  both expressed  opposition to hasty action by small groups of irresponsible men ; Labour  must act through its trusted and recognised leaders.  Mr. Clynes suggests the establishment  of a Council on the lines of  the Consumers&apos; Council at the Ministry of Food.   Mr. W.  A.  Apple-ton attributes the present unrest to three things : (i)  a  justified suspicion on the  part of Labour as to the attitude of Capital; (ii) the lack of a proper system of education;  and (iii) undue interference on the part of politicians iii industrial matters.      In the opinion of Mr. G.  D. H. Cole (in the &quot; Westminster Gazette &quot;), at the back  of:  all the Labour movements is a widespread discontent with the existing order in industry;  this is exemplified by the fact that wages questions have become quite secondary to  those  of hours  and the control of industry.  He mentions as two further causes of  discontent  the breakdown  of the old Trade Union organisations in face of the new requirements, and  the recent election.   He thinks the only remedy is for the Government to pass a 40-hour  Bill and another Bill making permanent provision for  adequate unemployment benefit.  Mr. A. M.  Carlyle,  formerly Managing Director of Harland  &amp; Wolff,  hopes that the  Government will at once arrange for a national 44-hour week for all trades and  businesses,  and leave it to the future  to work  out the wages question and a  further  reduction  or  increase in hours, should the trade or competition  of the world require it.  Meeting of Trade Union and Labour Party Congress.      The Executive of the Labour Party has decided to invite the Parliamentary  Committee  of the Trade Union Congress to consider the question of national unrest.      Mr.  Robert  Williams  published in the  &quot; Herald,&quot;  the  &quot; Labour Leader&quot; and.  &quot; Forward &quot; the following resolution which he will move at the next meeting of the Labour  Party Executive.  &quot; That this Executive Committee instructs its  officers to  summon a  National Convention of  delegates representing the Executive Councils  of the various  unions, the  Trades Councils,  local Labour parties, and delegates from the Workers&apos; .Com-  mittees and Shop Stewards&apos; Movement.  The matters to be discussed, shall be :-       (1) The Shorter Working Week.      (2) Out-of-Work Benefit for all men-soldiers, sailors  and civilians and women            at rates as high as the Trade Union rates in such employment as they may be             competent to take part.      (3) Intervention in Russia.      (4) Interference in the/affairs  of other  nations calculated to impair the right of the            respective peoples to determine their own political and industrial affairs.&quot;
     Mr. Williams adds that there can he no doubt that unless the lead comes from some more  or less responsible quarter, open insurrection or revolutionary action will speedily ensue.     The &quot; Nation &quot; advocates the setting up of a Council to deal with the questions at issue, which, it suggests, should consist of accredited Trade Union leaders like Mr. dynes, Mr. Adamson, Mr.  Smillie;  the leaders of  the Belfast, Glasgow and London strikes; capitalists like Lord Inchcape, Lord Pirrie,  Lord Leverhulme;   detached, politicians of the type of Mr. Asquith or Lord Grey, Lord Henry Bentinck and.

After the election of officers and a presidential address by M. Branting the Conference proceeded to discuss the question of &quot; Responsibility for the War.&quot; French delegates proposed to exclude German Majority Socialists.   Appeals for unity were made and a Commission was appointed to consider and report on the statement submitted by the German Majority Socialists.     This discussion took up the greater part of Monday and Tuesday.  On Wednesday and Thursday the League of Nations was discussed.   Peoples as well as Governments must  be represented.   An amendment moved by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald differentiates the  &quot;  Berne &quot; from  the &quot; Paris &quot; form of the League in demanding that the constituent Governments shall be represented by delegations from Parliaments and not from Cabinets.

At a  shop stewards&apos; meeting at Coventry on 5th February,  it was resolved, in opposition to the endeavours of the Workers&apos; Committee, that before ordering any  stoppage of work, a ballot should be taken of every workman affected, and the issues in dispute should be clearly defined on the official ballot paper. Unemployment continues . to be acute in Coventry; there are said to be over 800 skilled men without work.  At Bir- mingham  a committee of the Workers&apos; International  Industrial Union have been  trying to stir up disaffection.

Murphy is reported to be appealing strongly to the A.S.E. shop stewards  in Sheffield to  support  the Clyde in a  &quot; down tools &quot; policy.  However, conditions remain tranquil in this town and in Leeds.   A meeting of Engineers and Allied Trade workersis to be held in Leeds to discuss the problem  of National Factories ; it is hoped  that the Government may  be forced to  cancel auction sales  of the factories, and to run  them  as State factories.     In connection with the Nottinghamshire miners&apos; demand for the substitution of shovels for forks (referred to last week), the Owners&apos;  Associations have consented to recommend to their members this  substitution;  while the Miners&apos; representatives have agreed  torecommend  that deductions should be made in respect of dirt.  -North-W ester n.

Finally it was decided to leave these questions in the hands of the Mersey Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation.   The majoritywill therefore support this body in their effort to secure a 44-hour week by constitutionalmeans.  A mass meeting was called by the above Federation on 10th February, to discussthe hours  question.  At  a meeting of the Federation on 4th February, it was decided to ignore the new arbitration proceedings set up in place of Part I of the Munitions Act, andto apply direct to the  employers  for certain wage  advances.
