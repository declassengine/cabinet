I oirculato  for the information of  my colleagues         a  copy of a  memorandum which  I have addressed to  tho         Prime  Minister,                                   (Signed) A,O.QEDDES,         6th February 1919.SECRICT&amp;.T.6756
Prime Minister.     As instructed by you I have considered thopossibilities of giving effect to what I understandto bo your desire1*   To provide an organ of Government to which thepublic may turn in cases where thay have complaints tomako against the administrative acts of a Department ofState and in which they will find an unbiased authority,ablo either to explain the reasons for the action taken,-&apos;&apos;or to secure by co-operation with the administrativedepartment rectification in tho matter complained of,or by bringing mistakes and injudicious action of officialsbefore the Minister concerned, or in extreme cases beforethe Cabinet, to secure improvement in the working of theadministrative machinery of the State,2.   To provide an organ of Government which willstudy the administrative machinery of the State witha view to securing:-      (a) that the duties performed by each department of State form as nearly as possible ahomogenoouo group when viewed from tho recognised stand-
                   tpoint that each Department should supply a speciflo service to the State, for example, Health, Education,  Justice,etc.     I presume that it is your intention that  actionto secure any of theso ends shall in all cases be taken on a Cabinet decision in the manner now customary.3.   To provide a Department of Government responsible(a) for studying -directly or by the collection of statisticsand information- existing or impending political!,, social,oconomlc, or governmental difficulties in this country)(b) for knowing how other countries havo solved or are approaching such difficulties, and, generally(c) for formulating plans and suggestions for  the policyof the State,4.   To provide an organ of Government whioh will bethe central authority for scientific research.     These are great functions but. after carefulconsideration I have reached the conclusion that theydo not form a group which can effectively be
administered by one department.   The first) theservice of complaints, appears to mo to bolong without question to the Primo Minister&apos;s Department, whiehjthough not under that name, is now evolving from the cabinet secretariat as a result of the high standard of efficiency attained by it.   I believe that not onlythe simplest and least disturbing but the most satisfactory solution will be, if there is to bo a service of complaints, to create a special sectionof the Cabinet Secretariat to render that scrvioc.     The second and third functions, which involve thegcnoral supervision of the study and planning of thomachinery of government and of providing a service of intelligence and ideas, cover a vast group of poll-                                                   *tical, social and economic interests and might, I&quot;think, be entrusted with advantage to one organisation which would, I presume, be the Ministry of Reconstruction.Theso functions, as I conceive thorn, may bo brieflydescribed as those of a general staff for the cabinet.
     Scientific Research; the fourth function, isdifficult to deal with, by the ordinary prodessonof Government admlnistrati on*     After, caroful consideration I am satisfiedthat scientific research, at all events for thepresent, should continue to bo administered in thoname of the Privy Council.   Further, if at any timotho Lord President finds himself too fully ongagodYdth his other duties adequatoly to deal with research,there Would not be much; difficulty In arranging, to have some suitable minister with comparatively light depart-mental duties appointed a Vice President of the Counciland made responsible for representing in Parliamenttho Research Organisations of the Council.     My recommendations therefore .arc1.   Function I, should bo entrusted to the cabinet secretariat.2.   Function 2 and 3 to the Ministry of Reconstruction.5.   function 4 as at prcsont to tho Privy Council,                                (Signed) A.C,GEDI)ES6th February 1919,
