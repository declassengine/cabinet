There was an improvement in the weather  last week.,;ome snow fell but was followed by bright days  with sharp  frosts,and the land has dried considerably.   In the north, the Homecounties and south-eastern England field work,  with the exoeptionOf manure carting, was still at a standstill, but  in several other districts some ploughing and other cultivation  was  done.                     Local Organisation Division.                  &apos;7ork of Agricultural Executive, Committees.     l^termrlnation of Tenancies.-   During the week  two Orders havebeen made by the&quot;Board determining tenancies on account Of badfarming in respect of 167 acres.-     Allotments.   The B&amp;ard1s Inspectors have  been in communicationwith various Local Authorities *m the .necessity of  acquiring land  fo%allotments and in consequence tw Local Authorities are acquiring  ^acres which &quot;will provide 126 allotments.-   Under the Small Holdinguand Allotments Act, 16 other Local Authorities  are  negotiating  foraltogether 100 acres iut &amp;t which IT is hoped to&apos; provide 1-,00.&amp;-allotments.     Land Drainage,.   The Board have now exercised- their powers underSection 17 of the Land Drainage Act, 1010, and  have made an Orderconstituting Drainage Committees IN Anglesey, IN liontgorneryBFCL $,iii Warwickshire and in the Nsrth Riding of Yorkshire,, and  haveRelegated thereto the Board&apos;s powers, under Part II  of the  Act of &apos;1912.   The expenses cf the Drainage Committee s will- be borne hy &apos;the Board of Agriculture, and: the Executive  Committees haw. beenreminded.that no expenditure should be incurred by  them without theapproval ef the Biard being  first obtained.-          Cambridgeshire ...    IN Nevember 1917- a- small prlattera-f&apos; eamp.was established at leldreth, and&apos; by August 1918-&apos;thie- entire: course-  4Fthe River liel was scoured and cleansed j- overhanging and unsoundtrees were removed, from the water&apos;s edge and.&apos;the ban&amp;S were repaired.It was found possible to dam and by-pass the water  during  the  summer&apos;months and the accumulation,  of mud was thrawn or wheeled; out inbarrows.   This work was - carried out under or.d&apos;ers  Isailed - on frontage&apos;occupiers under the Defence  of the Realm Regulations..&apos;          Early in 191H-a.t the request&quot; of a  number of owners and&apos;occupiers the Executive C^committee took in&apos;hand  the&apos; improvement  ofIsle ham FEN, an area of about 3,500 acres with  a variety of fen SJILLS.There are about 100- occupiers of lar4 vathin: the-area;  anda  portionof. the Fen is market garden  land.   The Fen&apos;lie a, at a, height varying from 1 to 12 feet above  sea  level..-  Portions-of the Fen have beenlowered..by paring and burning and-by-digging for &quot;fuel.-          The. Board, on the  suggest    of the Executive- Qibfel^iteff,.issued an order in June  - last&apos;prohibiting the  paring an.d:-burning  ,TFFen land in-Cambridgeshire except with the permi s si on of the&apos;Committee.   A survey was made, and levels were  takeny-  The work ia-new, after ten months, near ing completion4    borne  11 miles of-maindrains, with a-top width varying from  9 to 14. feet have been i^enedcut, deepened and widened and the sides given a correct batter..The water, in the drains  is held up by dams which, are drawn at-  night.*
  16  fewer  than 40  gateway tunnels have  been fixed in the drains;  these  are elm trunks  of uniform size;   no  other form-of tunnel has  been found to be  suitable in Fen land.   A number cf these  tunnels  are supplied,  with slats which fix into a frame in order to  hold  up  water  for stock in dry  weather.   The  Fen is approached by  a number  of  wide parallel  Fen  droves,  on either side of which are usually  found  the main drains.    The  droves are common for stock grazing,  and  a number  of drinking-places have been  made and fenced off from the  drains *            For the drainage of the Fen  it has been found necessary  to  open an tld catchwater  drain on the edge of the Fen.   In its course  through a gravel  h&amp;ll the sides had slipped in and the drain had  become overgrown, and for many years the upland water had flowed  into the  Fen  instead  of being conveyed along its edge by the  oatchwater drain.  New that  the catchwater has been opened the  Fen  land will be  relieved of this water and   :only in times of  drought  will water be passed  into the Fen from the catchwater.            There still remains an area  of1 about 300 acres at the  northern  and  lower end.  of the Fen to be dealt with.   For the  drainage  of this  area it will be necessary to erect a small pumping  station to- lift the water into the main drain, which is carried  across the area at high level and Is Ultimately raised into the  River  Lark by the pumping station at Prlckwillow.      Yorkshire- (7oat  Rifling).   The Executive Committee some time  ago formulated a  scheme for the improvement Of the Awkley and  Blaxton drains which  are badly in need of cleansing, some of them  being  completely  grown  up, in consequence of which an adjoining  area of grass land is in a derelict condition.   A certain amount  of  progress has already been made with the work, although,delay has  been cauBSd by. the heavy rainfall and  also by the condition cf the  Gravel Drain  (belonging to the Hatfield ChaBe Corporation)  into  which  thiV Awkley  Drain  discharges;  pressure is now being brought  &apos;te  bear on the Corporation to improve the Gravel Drain and in another  part of the area concerned the t)0ncaater Rural District Council  have agreed to lay a  new 3! culvert in place of the It&quot; one now in  use.                                                     v                            Horticultural.

It .1B understood tnat the manufacture of  this  substance   is to  be carried out  on an extensive scale in the  near  future.

            An inspection has heen oarried out during tho woek of the  numerous nurseries and market gardens in Somerset with a view to  ascertaining the class of crops grown and tho methods of cultivation.    .  Bees.            The Department&apos;s scheme for re-stocking is being taken up  all  over the country and applications for stocks are&quot; coming in  satisfactorily.    Beekeepers whs have complied with the requirements  for  registration are now seouri g their supplies of sugar for fcha  spring feeding of bees.            Lectures on bee-keeping are being arranged in various  counties.Instruction and Advice.       Somerset.   Numerous nurseries and market gardens have been  visited.   Organic manure supplies have up to the present been  ample to jQ.eet the requirements cf these areas, but ere now  decreasingc    Growers have never used concentrated manures and  apparently do not understand their use. while spraying against  pests and diseases is also little understood,            The districts round Bridgwater are naturally well suited  for  vegetable orops and little if any fruit fta grown in the  neighbourhood, except that in cider orchards.   Vegetables are grown  as farm orops and not on any intensive system,   In several of the  marker gardens excellent examples cf continuous cropping of  vegetables were noted.       JlLilli&apos;    At the request of the County Horticultural Sub&quot;  Committee an inspection has been made of orchards, and, advice has  been given,    The difficulty in getting orchards oleaned is tho  lack of sufficient skilled labour,            An example of a successful small holder in the Conway  Valley has shown the importance of being near good markets.   This  man commenced a few years ago with very little knowledge of the  work, and with only half an acre of ground.   To-lay he possesses  s/;me 130 acres with a&apos; substantial balance at the bank.   His chief  markets are Llandudno and Colwyn Bay, both close at hand.       Ite bej3terJ)i trict,   The allotments movement is developing  strongly, the advice given by the local lecturers in the city  having resulted in excellent crops being produced.   A successful  lecture was given by one cf the Department5s Inspectors at the  Salford Technical Institute before a large and enthusiastic  audience, with the Lord Mayer in the Chair.            A visit of inspection .has been paid to Carringtbn,  Cheshire, for the purpose of inspecting some Corporation land; and  ascertaining its suitability as a training centre for ex-service  men in fruit and vegetable growing:  the scheme to be carried out  by the Manchester Corporationi   The Corporation have a catering  scheme on hand, and  so  the produce obtained  from these holdings  is assured of a good market.   The site is flat and appears to  be eminently suitable for the purpose  of growing fruit and  vegetables.                                           $                            Te ohnical Di yi si on *       Cereal-growing  in  high  districtsr   An  application was  reoently received from  the Cornwall Agricultural Executive  Committee for permission to  spend money on experiments on  farms                                    3.
in the Davidstow  and  St.Clether district, on the northern edge of Bodmin Moor. It was pointed  out that this area (roughly 40 sq. miles) was largely devoted to sheep and cattle-rearing, and farmers maintained that the land was unsuitable for corn, which would not ripen. It had been found, however, that on the southern edge of the Moor useful oat crops could be grown by earlier sowing and suitable manuring, and the  experiments suggested were far the purpose of ascertaining whether, on the northern edge, corn could, be brought earlier to harvest by somewhat similar management. The application was referred  to the Technical Committee, and at their request Dr. Russell visited the district and submitted a report in which he suggested certain experiments with different varieties,of oats, combined  with manurial trials. The Committee approved the report, but were of opinion that the experiments were more properly a matter for the County Education  Committee. The latter have now agreed to conduct the trials  in a somewhat simplified form. Arrangements have been made for a series of similar experiments to be carried out at three centres in Derbyshire.

Soil Insecticides. The search for a satisfactory soil insecticide still continues, and an arrangement has been made with the Department of Chemical Warfare whereby certain information and material collected by that body during the war may be passed on to the investigators at Rothamsted who are studying soil insecticides and sterilising agents. Both laboratory and glasshouse experiments have been started and are being pushed forward as rapidly as the nature of the problem allows.

Utilisation of parchlorate residues.  A large amount of parchlorate residues are now available, but unfortunately they cannot be used as fertiliser because of their highly  poisonous nature. An examination is being made into the possibility Of using them as ?-killers and fungicides.

? of land. Two farms in one occupation, in East Sussex, were inspected in connection with an explication by the Agricultural Executive Committee for authority to ? into possession.

Cost of Production of Milk. The Sub-Committee of the Technical Committee appointed to consider this subject have ? and tabulated information received from selected farmers as regards the cost of production of milk on their farms during the two winters, 1916-17 and 1917-18, and the summer period, 1917.  In order to complete  the record  of costs  during the two whole years, an enquiry schedule has  been addressed to the farmers concerned, from which information will be secured regarding  costs of production in the summer Of 1918.

Women&apos;s Branch.

Most of the surplus labour notified at the end of last week has now been absorbed. Women engaged on Emergency work are being recalled to fill the vacancies which exist in the various counties. Forewomen, experienced milkers, dairy-women, ploughwomen,  male-catchers and pruners are wanted. The women who have been released from the Land Army during the last three months were not sufficiently skilled to have filled efficiently any cf these posts. It is not possible to supply sufficient women for the timber camps which have been started. In order to meet the demand far extra labour in the spring, of which there is wilespread evidence at this time,  the Branch is consulting with the Ministry of Labour and with the other women&apos;s services as to a further  supply of suitable women to do farm work.


          It is reported tint one of the women tractor driversrecently employed in .&quot;soex has been awarded a silver cup hy heremployer &quot;for excellent work done at Chignall with a ifordson Tractor.&quot;          Twenty women are now engaged on motor tractor drivingin 3ast Kent and a very appreciative letter has been received fromthe Tractor Representative as to their work-.   The ExecutiveCommittee have granted to two of them gratuities for their good work during the months September, October and November.          At the present time there are 792 Land Army women atwork in South 7alee.   Ihost of these are engaged in general farmwork, but in Breconshire some of them have assisted in shepherdingand in dipping and  shearing operations, while four have givenvaluable help in the lambing season.

Horse Scheme.                                    ;          Sales, principally cf horse-drawn implements, have takenplace in the following counties - Hampshire, ^ssex, Orford, Salop,Surrey, Gloucester, Cornwall, at very satisfactory prices.   Inthe case of carts and lorries    the cost price was realised inmany cases, and in  a few exceeded.   There has been no substantialloss with any implements.          About 500 horses were sold during the past week at very good prices.   39 horses were sold at York at an average price Of108 guineas..   Up to the present, 2,230 surplus horses have been sold.     Control on Agricultural Machinery.   It has been decided  thatexport and import restrictions and price  control on agricultural machinery, so far as control is at present exercised by theAgricultural hachinery Department,  shall  be suspended forthwith.The effect will be  that no permit to import or  export will  be refused by the Board of Trade except on general political or economic grounds, that there will be no restriction on themanufacture of agricultural machinery nnd that  with the exceptionof agricultural machinery                       in respect of which licences have alreadybeen granted there  will be no price control in  future,aepresentatives of  agricultural implement-manufacturers anddealers have given  an undertaking that  the United Kingdom will besupplied and that prices will not be rais3d against users.   TheAgricultural Machinery Deportment will  eease  to take  any actionin the matter of imports, exports, manufacture  or price  control.Any, advice which the Board of Trade may require in dealing  with agricultural machinery will   he given by the  three Departmentscf Agriculture,

Cohere iala .IUviPiori.     Nitrate^ of^Boda,   It has not yet &quot;been possible to deliver any ofthe Hitiate&quot;&apos;02&quot;&quot;bcda&quot;&quot;from 6ovorr.rn.orvt otooks which was recently offered for sale at  ,20 per ton.   The de! ay htiu been ci,nced by an endeavourto meet the complaints of holders cf nitrate of soda in this country,who felt that they had a grievance owing to the ract that they hadbought nitrate at a higher price than  20 per ton,   The Ministry ofMunitions is endeavouring to make an arrangement which v/ill enable5,000 tons to. be sold tc agriculturists without prejudice tomerchants and traders, but in the meantime the complaints receivedby the Department are becoming very numerous.   As it is possiblethat the negotiations referred to above may be protracted,application has been made to the Treasury for permission to issue5,000 tons without delay.     Potash.  Muriate of Potash from Alsace is now being offered :for expert by the French Government, and traders* in this country are anxious to obtain permission to import,   The price at whichthey could sell would be  30 per ton or less.   If importation is allowed, tho Potash produced by the British Potash Company at Oldburywill have to be sold at the same pried.   The output from Oldbury upto the 31st May has been purchased by this Department at an average price of  36,13s. 4d,   The suggestion has therefore been made tothe Potash Production Department that the purchase of Alsatian Potashmade by British merchants, should be polled with the Oldbury output,and sold at an average price sufficient to cover this Departmentsliability.     Market5ng^SocJ:eties.  A guarantee was given in May last thatthe I)eparTmer.t wcula^bsar any loss up to  250 incurred in the firstyearJs working of the Fruit and Vegetable Marketing Societies.This arrangement was a war measure adopted in order to avoid awaste of &amp;i?rjl.ue food, but it places these particular Societies ina specially favourable position as compared with other Co-operative societies of a similar nature.   The Societies have therefore beeninformed that the guarantee will be confined strictly to the firstyearns trading and in the case of Societies which are not yet in working order will not extend beyond the 31st December next.          An enquiry is being made into the general system of marketing fruit and vegetables in this country with a view todevising means of assisting the industry.     Transport.   The Great Eastern Railway has recently increased its cha rgos for the transport of perishable products and made themuniform with those of other railways,   This has given rise to somecomplaint but the rates previously charged were unremunerative andthere are no grounds on which the Railway Executive could be pressed to allow lower charges to be made in the case of the Eastern Counties,than elsewhere-.   Although the increased Jrates are said to presshardly on growers, they are compensated for by the high pricesobtained for produce at the present time.                              *. 6  &quot;*
     Seed Qata. for France.

A consignment of seed potatoes (Up-to-date) supplied to the French Government for Morocco has been shipped and afurther consignment of 1,000 tons of &quot;Royal Kidney&quot; seod is newbeing loaded at Boston, Lines, for shipment to Tunis.     ffart Disease.          During the year 1918 arrangements wore made to carryput a series of experiments on allotments in infected areas witha view to testing different varieties of immune potatoes forsuitability and oropping  capacity in order that local growersmight be able to judge the variety of each class which would be most likely to meet their requirements.          The results of  these trials have new been reoeivsd andtabulated.   They show that, on the whjsle, the immune varietieshav&amp; given exceptionally  good yields^   A full report is being prepared for issue  in the Board&apos;s&quot;Journal&quot;.

The work is being carried out by theCommittee&apos;s  own shipwrights there being  no  local labour available.They were greatly impressed with the way the work has been carriedout and with the  steady running and the  absence of vibration.          The engines were tested under  various weather conditions and the various men&apos;s small complaints looked into and appropriate measures taken.          Some of the men were  inclined  to  complain  of the cost  ofthe work, but at  the  same time  they expressed themselves highlyRelighted both with the engines supplied and with the way  in -which  the wsrk had  been carried out.

Flax Product ion&apos; Branch.   Deseeding is proceeding v/ith allspeed, it&quot; being recognised that all seed for Irish sowing shouldbe dispatched from England by the end of this month.   250 tons perweek is aimed at.   The output of seed for tho week ending February6th is 202 tons as against 173 tons fcr the previous week.   Thetotal output cf dressed seed to date is 1,276 tons, or approximately15,000 bags.          The pressing matters at the moment, after deseeding, arethose relating to retting.   The delay in the provision of rottingtanks has made it essential to arrange a much larger programme ofiew-retting than would otherwise have been necessary.   these arrangements are well in hand and dew-retting will commence duringthis month and will continue until the retting  season ends inApril.   A further scheme of dew-retting will be necessary in theautumn.          A programme for temporary scutching is being pushed forward, so that It will be possible to scutch  a portion of the1910 crop in advance of the completion of the permanent premises,which should have been ready in April and may net be ready untilthe fall of the year.   This programme is most  essential fcrthree reasons:-
I,ill       (l)   tc  secure  returns  for  flax at  the  highest prices,  as  prices             will  assume  a  downward  tendency.       (2)   To  save  interest on capital invested in the crop,  and       (3)   to  avoid the heavy expense of  establishment charges during             the time when  without  such emergency measures,  a labour             organisation got togeth r with difficulty would have  to             V- discharged.            Thf consent of the Treasury to tin  agreement with Mr. Morton  with  respect &quot;to dry  rs has enabled  gr-&apos;at progress to bo made with tho  rlans,  and night  and day work on this matter is taking place, in  which  the Branch is giving every assistance.       Dairy Branch.   Under arrangements  which the Board made with tho  British Dairy Institute  and  University College,  Heading,  a Special  Course-  for a  selected number of  those teachers who were engaged in  giving  instruction in cheese making  in English and Welsh Counties  last  season;   also a number of  other  trained  instructresses who  it is  expected  will be  employed  this season, is in progress at  the present  time ,   It commenced on  konday last and  will continue for a period of  three weeks.            The purpose of the Course is to improve the teaching,in  itinerant schools.   The teachers will be brought into touch with all  recent  developments  and  will be  accorded every opportunity  cf making  known the difficulties experienced  in their  practice.         -   Three members  of the staff of  the  Dairy Branch will address  the class for the  purpose  of bringing to the notice of those in  attendance the special commendable  procedure adopted in certain of  the more  progressive counties.            It  is understood the Development Commissioners have in  part  approved  of the Board&apos;s  Scheme for  the provision of Arable  Dairy  Farming Demonstrations.  1  The application to the Commissioners  was  for 20  demonstration holdings.   It is believed that the  Commissioners have recommended to  the Treasury that 10 be approved.            In  addition to these 10  centres which, are to be distributed  through England and  &quot;Tales, there will be the one already approved to  be conducted  in conjunction  with the Cheshire County Council, and  the provision of  better  facilities  at Harper Adams College  for  experimental  work in this  subject.

The first prosecution of an employer for payment of a worker at less than the minimum rates took place at Maidstone Sessions 10th February in respect of the payment of a male worker of 16 years of age at a rate of  6/- a week, thff hours worked having been 57 on weekdays and 4 on Sundays.   (The minimum rate applicable was 33/- a week of 54 hours in summer and 48 hours in winter, with overtime rate of 9d. an hour on weekdays and lid. an hour On Sunday).   On a visit by an Inspector in November last two workers were found to be underpaid, and the employer paid the arrears to one of tho workers without any question. Kio reason for not doing so in the other case was that the man was not worth the money, that he had been told to try and find employment else- where but had remained for his own convenience and that the employer did not understand that in these circumstances he was liable for payment of tho minimum rate.                         After the visit of the Inspector the man was dismissed.   The employer was given a chance to pay the arrears, but he refused to do so On the ground that he was boing backed up by the National Farmers&apos; Union who held strong views as to the in- equity of fixing the minimum rate for men to come into operation at 18. The underpayment was fully proved in Court and was not controverted, but the Bench, after retiring, stated that while a technical affence had been committed they did not regard it as being serious.   It was the first case under the Act which had come before them and they had accordingly decided not to record a conviction against the employer, but they ordered the payment of 4/- Court costs and  7.1.4. agreed arrears due to the worker in respect of the period from the 5th August,  . 1918, to the date on which he left the employers service.   Owing to the six months&apos; limitation imposed by the Summary Jurisdiction Act it was not possible to prove in Court the underpayment prior to the 5th August, and no arrears for this period were ordered to be paid.           During the week 64 cases of complaint of non-payment of the minimum rates were received;  53 cases were sent to Inspectors for visit;  enquiries by correspondence were made in 147 cases;  and 19 cases were completed.   Reports were received from Inspectors in 16 cases.                  Tithe. Copyhold, Commons and Survey Branch.           16 applications for the redemption of tithe-rentcharge were received.   This is considerably more than the record for any previous week since the outbreak of war, and is even 50% in excess of the normal number received prior to the war.           Among the cases completed was one for the redemption of a rentcharge created under the Vicarfs Rate in Halifax Act, 1877. Rentcharges payable under this Act do not come vdthin the provisions of the Tithe Act, 1918&quot;, but are redeemable only at twenty-six years&apos; purchase under the local Act.           The.enquiries received as to the procedure in redemption included one from Dulwich College,  the Governors cf which have passed a resolution to the effect that all tithe rentcharge on their estates shall be redeemed under the recent Act.           The Board have addressed to the Promoters cf the Llanelly Corporation Bill certain suggestions arising out of their examination of the Bill with a view to amendments being made so as to ensure that the new boundaries of the Borough may be more clearly and more accurately defined than they would be if the Bill v/ere to pass in its present form.
