In addition to  the  various strikes, the subject  of a further reduction  of hours is still widely discussed, the rebel  element hoping to arouse furtheragitation on the subject. .Part IV:  Disputes.         &apos; *-    (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work-The most important are dealt with in Part I.    (b) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. Two cases are reported.                        PART I. THE INDUSTRIAL  UNREST.    The  labour movements  which have given rise to the present industrial unrest fallroughly into two categories between which a fairly distinct line may be drawn.   Thereare the constitutional movements through the recognised channels, voiced by the normallyelected officials and executives, which, as a general rule, have not as yet resulted in strikes ;and there are the frankly &quot; unofficial &quot; movements, which have almost invariably resultedin strikes.  The sudden development of the latter class of disputes has brought to a headthe conflict which has for a long time been foreseen between the accredited Trade union officials and the extreme &quot;shop steward &quot; elements, who seek to capture the Trade Unionmachine and to substitute direct action for the ordinary method of collective bargaining.The present series of strikes affords a  test of the extent to which the executives of theunions are  able, and are willing, to exercise their authority and to control the movementof which they are the constitutional leaders.    Briefly, the position at the end of the week with regard to the more important strikeswas as follows :-In-Scotland a movement is on foot to establish  a 40-hour week in alltrades, without any reduction in wages ; this resulted in the stoppage of many thousands of workpeople in various trades, principally shipyard workers and engineers on the Clydeand the Firth of Forth and at Edinburgh, but has  not as yet paralysed any  of these   (C 1644) 130  2/19  H&amp;S                                                       A
 localities;  an attempt to bring about a stoppage of municipal services lias  failed.  In Belfast a strike of engineers and shipyard workers for a 44-hour week has spread to the municipal employees in the gas,  electricity and tramway departments, and by  cutting off all lighting and much power and heating is bringing the industrial life  of the city to a standstill.   This  strike is openly &quot; unofficial,&quot; and the proposed stoppage  was so described on the  ballot paper.  On the North-Bast Coast and the Humber men in the shipyards reinforced by a few engineers have been idle since the beginning  of the month, the chief crux of the dispute here being the feared reduction in earnings  of the piece and &quot; lieu &quot; workers consequent upon  the introduction of the 47-hour week.  On the Thames some 12,000  to 15,000 ship  repairers are on strike, demanding 15s. a week advance in wages.   Here also the strike is quite unofficial;  it is  being managed by  a local strike committee.  Bristol Channel ship repairers have ceased work in support  of their demand for  increased tariff rates.   Trouble appears also to be brewing at  Barrow and South- ampton.  In the coal-fields a dispute over  surfacemen&apos;s mealtimes, which  involved the whole of the  Yorkshire coal-field, has been settled by the concession of the men&apos;s demand on this point, as was a strike of some 50,000 miners in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire in sympathy with a few men  discharged to make way for demobilised soldier-miners. A dispute involving many thousands of miners in Fifeshire appears to be coming to an end as a result of the energetic  action of the men&apos;s officials.   Several thousands of miners who have been on strike in West Lothian are reported to be returning  to work, on the recommendation of their executive.  There are spasmodic outbreaks in other  coal-fields, particularly South Wales.     So far as the &quot;constitutional &quot; movements are concerned they are, with the exception of the coal miners&apos; demand for a 6-hour day, mostly directed towards obtaining a reduction in the hours of labour to a week  varying from 44  to 48 hours, accompanied usually by a request for other concessions.     Attention, has been directed  above to the fact that the strikes that have occurred have not usually  been undertaken with the sanction of the Trade Unions.  It is true that the three societies principally concerned with the question of the payment of piece and &quot; lieu &quot; workers (the United Society of Boilermakers, the Shipconstructors and Ship^ wrights and the Associated Blacksmiths  and Ironworkers)  are paying strike  benefit to their members on the North-East Coast, but this payment has  only recently been begun, and it is only recently that the Executives of  these three societies, outwardly at all events, have taken official action  on behalf of their members who are involved in the dispute. The action  of the Executives is in a sense unconstitutional as it is? in effect, going behind the  backs  of the  (men&apos;s) Engineering  and Shipbuilding Trades Federation, and  the Negotiating Committee of engineering and shipbuilding Trade Unions by whom  the National  agreements on the 47-hour week were negotiated.  It is, however, to be noted that, while  the general ballot  of the whole of the  Federated unions was in favour of the  47-hour  week,  the vote  of these  societies, with  the  exception of the  Black- smiths,  was adverse (a 44-hour week being demanded), and  although  they  are called upon to accept the  decision of ihe&quot;&quot; slumped &quot;  vote they  claim to  have  the right to strike pay.  The  strike  in the Yorkshire  coal-field  had the official backing  of the  Yorkshire Miners Association;  and  two  or three  unions, numerically not  of  the first rank,  have  sanctioned the  strike  of  their  members  in Scotland.   Elsewhere the  strikes  have not  received the sanction of  the  executives  of the unions, and strike benefit is  not being paid.   In addition, the responsible officials and executives have taken direct action to stop these movements.  In Belfast a serious situation has been caused by the stoppage  of the municipal   services;  Mr.  Tevenan, the secretary of the  Municipal Employees  Association, has gone to Belfast to endeavour to get the men back to work. Mr. Brownlie, the chairman of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, has intimated that thesociety  wish  to deal with their Scottish malcontents without any  help in the way of mediation.  The Scottish Union of Dock Labourers in a notice to their branches strongly discouraged participation in the 40-hour  week movement and intimated that any such action would be regarded  as disloyalty to the  National Transport Workers Federation, whose claims, already put forward on a national  basis, include a 44-hour week.  The executive of the Fifeshire Miners Association took active steps to get men on strike back to work.     The most notable movements,  the Scottish and Belfast hours movements and the Port of London wages movement, all three  of  which are for  the most part unofficial, do not appear, at their inception at any rate, to be correlated.   The engineers and shipyard -workers at Barrow sent delegates to all the principal centres affected by the hours rnove-.ment in an effort to obtain unity of aim/and are stated to be calling a National Conference to &quot;achieve this.  An  unsuccessful  endeavour was made by them to get the men  on the
 Clyde and at Belfast to defer action pending this Conference.  The Scottish movement originated with the Glasgow shop stewards and the Clyde Workers&apos;  Committee.  With the help of the Scottish Trade Union Congress it was hoped to extend the area of the dispute so that the whole of Scotland would be affected, and as the dispute at Belfast developed, delegates were sent from the Clyde to assist the movement there.  The dispute among the ship repairers in the Port of London is also the outcome of the efforts of the shop  stewards in the area, who have taken matters  out of the hands of the Executives. The outstanding feature of the Scottish strike, apart from its being an effort to popularise the &quot; general &quot; strike, is that no demand was made to the employers.  A public announce- ment was made of the intention to call a strike on 27th  January unless their demand for a 40-hour week was conceded, and no effort was made to  open negotiations  upon the matter.    An examination of the causes of the disputes illustrates the lengths to which the men appear to-be willing to go for seemingly quite trivial causes. In  the Yorkshire miners&apos; dispute nearly 150,000 men, underground and  surface workers, went on strike  to secure a-total stoppage of machinery during the surfacemen&apos;s mealtime of 20  minutes in the forenoon.  In the Nottinghamshire coal-field, where the men demanded the reinstatement of some 25 men who had entered the pits since the war, and who had been discharged to make room for demobilised miners, a mass meeting called for a general coal strike,  and the calling  out  of the Triple Alliance (Miners, Railwaymen  and Transport Workers) in support of this and other demands which they afterwards put forward..  On the Mersey the dock labourers are in a. restless state owing to the continued shortage and the high price of beer.  The readiness with which men go out on strike  is no doubt largely attribu-- table to the psychological effect.of four and a half years of war, which has had the effect of confusing perspective and altering the sense of proportion. .                      -&quot;.    The main demands, while they generally are somewhat inchoate and lack unanimity, tend definitely in the direction of reduced hours, partly to absorb the surplus labour whicfi will result from demobilisation and partly to obtain more leisure for recreation and educa- tion.   For the rest the variety and triviality of the causes of the outbreaks suggest that there is a large mass of discontent, which, lacking  definite  direction, and perhaps hot hopeful. of  legitimate satisfaction  through  the  normal  channels of  negotiations  and mediation,  affords opportunity to  those  who desire  to exploit industrial  strife for political ends.  &apos;         &apos;  !:  &quot;                                     .            :                 &apos;&quot;&apos;i: PART&apos;1T.-PRESS COMMENTS.                         (1) The Labour mid Socialist Press.                       &apos;;  &apos;                                (A) Peace Conference.     The Labour papers, amdiseussing the Peace Conference  this week, give prominence to two special subjects.  One! is the press agitation for admittance to the sittings of the Conference, and the other,&apos; the;treatment; of Russia  and. Poland.  In the words  of the&quot;Herald,&quot; the old system of secret diplomacy, far. from being destroyed, is now actually in operation in  Paris;  the treatment of Russia and Poland  prove this beyond a  doubt. In Russia the Allies have violated the principle of self-determination, for while they allow the  Tsar&apos;s minister,  M. Sazanoff, free access to the Conference, they deny this right to representatives  of the Soviet Government, which is  now recognised to be the de facto Government of  Russia.  In Poland the Allies have  discredited  Pilsudski,  just as they discredited Kerensky.   They have  recognised-and in a sense created the  aristocratic, anti-popular Dmowsky Government, which is not acknowledged by the people of Poland. The &quot; Herald &quot; does not think that President Wilson  is to blame, nor the&apos;representatives of our own country, but the Chauvinists of France and Italy.  In &quot; Forward&quot; the obstacles to the inclusion of Russia  at the Conference are not considered to be all on one side, for the paper does not yet admit that the Soviet Government is truly representative of Russia.     Referring to the question of the exclusion of the press from Conference meetings,.it seems obvious to the &quot; Herald &quot;  that the only reason for this exclusion &quot; must be the intention on the part  of some  of the members that bargaining shall take place there of such a kind that public opinion would cry shame upon it.&quot;  The &quot; Call&quot; is  of the same opinion.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot;  contrasts the Allies&apos;  original preference for  secrecy with the open manner in which negotiations were carried on at Brest-Litovsk.   &apos;&apos; Forward alone  seems  satisfied with the  arrangements reached  regarding the  publicity allowed at the  Conference.   The  compromise, it says, has been framed along  the lines familiar in Labour and  Socialist gatherings;  for these, even, find it expedient  to do much of their hammering and forging in committee.    (C 1641)                                                                 A 2
______HUM                                 (B) Home Affairs. Conscientious Objectors.     Some of the papers again refer to the continued imprisonment of conscientious objectors. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; contains a strong appeal for their release, and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; prints two long articles on the subject,  In one it is pointed out that the absolutists are fighting more against industrial than against military conscription, since they could obtain their release from prison if they were prepared to accept employment under industrial conscription.  It gives detailed accounts of the sufferings undergone by individual conscientious objectors. Selling National Faciories.     All  the  papers  mentioning this subject  condemn the  Government policy.  The   Herald &quot; alone acknowledges that the War Cabinet has made certain concessions,  but adds &quot;the decisions of War Cabinets are not always irrevocable.&quot;   The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and &quot; Forward &quot; contain long articles on the subject by Sir Leo  Chiozza Money.  In  the latter  he is especially indignant  that ships  constructed at public expense to bring food to the nation at cost price, should now be handed over to private capitalists..   He ends, &quot; If this Government goes on selling, a succeeding Labour Government  must and will demand  &apos; restitution &apos; of every ship, every factory, and every piece of machinery.&quot; Shorter Working Week: -     The. &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; the  &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Forward&quot; refer  to this subject in connection with the  threatened strike in Scotland for  a 40-hour week.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; remarks that the  Government  and employers by professing surprise at this threat, ignore the fact that the demand for a 40-hour week was  made more than a year ago at the Scottish Trade  Union Congress, and that it has twice been officially brought to the notice of the Government. The Miners&apos; Conference and Industrial Unrest.     Both the  &quot; Herald &quot;  and the &quot; Labour  Leader &quot; note the consternation caused in capitalist press by the miners&apos; demands.   The &quot; Herald &quot; remarks  that the miners are not  likely  to take any notice of  the  old argument,  so often used without success, that the  trade will be ruined if such demands are granted.     John McLean, writing in the &quot; Call,&quot; declares that  the miners&apos;  demands have given all the workers a common issue for which to fight, while demobilisation has already created a menacing body of unemployed ; thus the time is ripe  for revolution in this country. Discharged Munition  Workers.     Miss Mary MacArthur, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; asks what the Government is going to  do about  the  thousands  of unemployed  women who  are walking backwards and forwards between  their houses and the Labour Exchanges.  Referring to the work waiting for them at laundries and in domestic service, Miss MacArthur says perhaps the laundry proprietors who write  to the newspapers will tell the public what wages and conditions  they are offering ?  If  the women  are not flocking  into such professions, may they not have substantial reasons ?                                 *                   (2) Daily Press on Demobilisation and Discharge.     Criticisms of Government schemes  for demobilisation, &amp;c, appear to have become perceptibly fewer during the last two weeks.  Most of the statements alluding to such matters  are quotations from official sources.                        (A) Discharge of Munition  Workers. Re-absorption into Industry.     &quot; The  Times &quot; (24th January) states that &quot; the unemployment figures show that the process of  discharge and demobilisation is being accompanied by a parallel process  of re-absorption which is accelerating.&quot;   Up to 10th January only 60 per cent, of the people to whom the donation policies had been issued were receiving payment;  the  other 40per cent.-250,000 civil workers and 10,000 soldiers-had withdrawn their policies.  ine &quot; Glasgow Herald &quot; (23rd January) reports that fewer men were unemployed in the, week ending 17th January  than in the previous week;  the number of unemployed women,however, had  increased.
 Unemployment Benefit.    The unemployment donation scheme is criticised on two grounds: In the first place,because of its extravagance.  The &quot; Globe &quot; (21st January) protests against any renewal of a scheme which costs some  600,000 weekly, and that for unemployment only, not for work.  In the second place, a complaint is made in the &quot; South Wales News &quot;  (20thJanuary) that a number of undeserving  persons are in receipt of the donation.   the blame is laid entirely on the Government  for this misapplication of public money.Women.    The meeting of temporary women clerks at Caxton Hall on 21st January passed aresolution demanding among other things that independent women should be dischargedfirst, women with dependents retained longest,  and a 6-hour day to be introduced intoGovernment offices on the two-shift system.   (&quot; Daily Express,&quot; 22nd January.)                          (jB) Demobilisation of the Army. 0Pivotal Men.    According to the &quot; Leeds Citizen &quot; (18th January) the want of pivotal men in industryis largely contributing to the maintenance of war conditions and prices.  In the &quot; GlasgowHerald &quot; (20th  January) employers complain that, although they have restricted  theirlists of application for pivotal men to small numbers, these lists are still further reducedby  the local advisory committees, with the  result  that  they  secure only a very  small proportion of their men.  The &quot; Daily Express &quot; (21st January) states that the Demobili-sation Committee for the South Wales coal-field decided on 20th January that doubleshifts shall be worked in order to make room for the returning miners, while men whohave entered the mines since the war began shall be the first to be dismissed.  64,182miners have now been discharged and re-engaged at the pits.                PART III.-GENERAL TOPICS AND DISTRICT REPORTS.                                  (A) General.Current Demands,    The demand for alterations in the hours&apos;  agreement affecting the  engineering and allied trades  continues to be the chief cause  of the existing  unrest.   The subjects  ofdismissals  from  private munition works  and the re-employment of demobilised men,however, are  also responsible for a certain amount of disaffection this week.    A further meeting was held on Saturday, 25th January, between Sir R. Horne andthe representatives  of the boilermakers,  shipwrights and blacksmiths on the interpre-tation of the  47-hour week agreement.  The representatives of these three unions tried to urge the Labour Minister to obtain the withdrawal of a memorandum drawn up on24th December, which contained the clause that &quot; No change shall be made in pieceworkprices or lieu  rates.&quot;  This clause, they urged, conflicted with the assurance given in thefinal agreement  that &quot;weekly wages would  not be reduced under the 47-hour week.&quot;It was pointed out that the memorandum  was only a recommendation of the negotiating committee, and  had never been submitted for ratification to any representative body.Sir R. Horne, however, felt unable to act without first consulting the other bodies concernedin the negotiation.  It appears that the members of other societies affected were disappointment -pointed that  the question had not been finally settled, as they were willing to resumework immediately.    Of the many demands from various classes of labour reported last week, those of thepolice have since been postponed ; the leaders seem to have  come to the conclusion thatthe time is not yet ripe to make another attempt to enforce recognition of their union.    The Legislative Council of the United Textile Factory Workers Association haveformulated a demand for the reduction of cotton mill hours from 55^ to 44 per week.    Besides the threat of the operative bakers to strike if night work is not abolished, itappears that the master bakers, complaining of increased  working expenses,  have alsothreatened to&apos;take action which &quot; may affect the supply of bread to the public &quot; unless they are allowed to  raise  the price of bread or are supplied  with cheaper flour.   ,    It is reported that branches of the National Union of Railwaymen have been warned that instructions  may be issued forbidding them to work with non-unionists.  The Boardof Trade and Railway Executive have been  informed that before revised conditions  ofservice become operative all non-unionists must be eliminated.
  Mr. Clyries on Causes of Labour Unrest.,                        z) &quot;     v  ,,,  .; Mi;. Clynes,  speaking atV&apos;tlie&apos;Savoy, ,Hotel on.24th&apos; January, attributed&apos; the existing  unrest to.many real grievances,  Most.of these related to the transition conditions.fr8m ;^v;ar to peace;  for instance,  difficulties arising out of demobilisation methods and the : unemployment caused by the winding  up of war industries, accounted for much of the  unrest.  Again, the new and untrained men who have taken over the leadership of LabQilr,  have one remedy for every grievance^ and that is &quot; force&quot;;  while the fear that conditions,  bad as they now are, may get worse, has induced the mass of the workers to follow, any  method, however foolish, to obtain concessions while they can.-   The shortage  of houses ,.and the/continued high price of,food are also mentioned as conducing&apos;to unrest.,  One , remedy&apos;suggested by Mr. Clynes is the setting up of a Parliament df Industry to, give  guidance in our efforts.-to secure the national well-being.                         &apos;  New Joint Industrial  Councils.                                  ,      Three new Joint Industrial Councils have  been set Up recently (1) in the, Electrical  Contracting Industry, the first meeting was held on 22nd January, when the questions1 of  the 4^-hour week, revision  of wages and non-union labour were to be&apos;discussed;  (2) in  tlie &quot;Packing-case Making&apos;Trade, the first meeting&apos; was&apos; held on 24th January ;  (3) in the  Commercial Road Transport industry, the first meeting  to be held on 26th February; &apos; Test Case   Authority of Federations.                      .          - \&quot;    ,A,case was heard last week at the Dewsbury County Court which deals with the  question whether a decision arrived &apos;at by a federation or trade union could be enforced,&apos;;iri&quot; the case of an individual member of that federation or trade union;  The plaintiff,.an  employee in the firm of Messrs. S. Crawshaw and  Sons, leather belting manufacturers,  claimed  arrears of wages under an &quot;agreement arrived at between the workmen&apos;s and  employers&apos; federation, the firm in question being a member of the latter.  The  judgment. was given against the plaintiff, however, on the ground that members of the men&apos;s unions  at times  repudiated arrangements made by their leaders.  Thus it appears that agreements  made in the name df a &quot; loose&quot;1 federation of employers or men  cannot be held binding  on the individual members unless it can be shown by the constitution  that the federation  possessed general power to bind its members.                -         ,  ...          y                              .  (B) District Reports.                     -.&apos;.&apos;-&apos;&apos;  &apos;-,  London and South-Eastern.     The trouble among the engineers appears to have calmed down;  the most serious  situation this week has arisen in connection with the strike of the ship repairers in the Port  of London.  &apos;              i;.  West Midlands.     Coventry seems to be the centre of considerable unrest.  The engineers are still agitat-  ing for a 40-hour week and; threaten  to take it unless the Government  intervenes.  The  real reasons for this unrest are said to be the growing unemployment, and the low prices-  offered for what is termed  Civil work..  As an  example, it is reported that the firm of  Hotchkiss et Cie. proposed to discharge all their employees-with the exception of 40-  at the same time ;  but they were advised to carry out their dismissals gradually in view  of the large number of unemployed already in the town.  Yorkshire and East Midlands.     The concession of a 47-hour, week has been well received both in Sheffield and Leeds.  It is significant that in Leeds the details in the arrangements were placed before the men  before.they were put into effect.  The  small amount  of piecework done in this district  is another circumstance which may account for this satisfactory frame of mind.                   i                                        *  North-Western.     In this district there seems to  be considerable  difference of opinion on the question  of the 47-hour week.  Liverpool and Manchester are said to be unaffected by the agitation  for a further reduction of hours. ! Efforts are being made, however, to induce the Liverpool  engineers to support the Glasgow strike.  It is in Barrow that the rebel element is strongest,  and it is hoped by these that the meeting of the National Committee of  Allied Trades (21st  January), will decide to strike for a still shorter working week.  In Manchester some dissatisfaction is  reported,  owing to the alleged discharge  of skilled men while dilutees  are retained.
Northern.   , The position on the Tyne remains serious.Wales.    Considerable  discontent is apparent in this district.  The engineers are dissatisfied with arrangements under the 47-hour week.  In the Dowlais  district trouble has arisenamong the miners, in connection with the re-employment of demobilised miners.Scotland.    Reference is made in Part I to the general stoppage to secure a 40-hour week.    Unrest is reported among the  soldiers in Scotland regarding the death of PrivateFrancis Jones (Morris)  (whose body arrived packed in sawdust), and trouble is anticipatedunless some official explanation is forthcoming.    John McLean is reported to have addressed a crowded meeting in Hamilton on  20thJanuary, held under the auspices of the One Union Movement.  A resolution was passedcalling upon the  Government to release all conscientious objectors;  it was decided tosend a copy of this  resolut on to President Wilson,  asking  for the  release of Americanpolitical  prisoners, and especially of Tom Mooney.                                   PART IV.-DISPUTES.(a)  Involving a Stoppage of Work.    The Coal Controller reports seven fresh stoppages for the week ending 28th January;in two cases work has already been resumed.          - A strike has been in progress in the Mansfield and neighbouring collieries, because 25 men,        who had entered the mines since the war, were given notices to quit in order to make room for        returning soldiers. An agreement has been arrived at and work resumed.           Reference is made in Part I to certain important stoppages of work by. coal miners.    The War Office Contracts Department has nothing to report.Reported from Other Sources.           Reference is made in Part I to the important stoppages of work among engineers, shipyard        workers, and other classes of workpeople on the Clyde and at a few other localities in Scotland,        at Belfast, on the North-East Coast, Humber, Port of London and  Bristol Channel.           The dispute of the barbers in London appears to be coming to an end.  The strike  at the        Clement-Talbot National Factory ended qn 27th January;  arrangements regarding starting        times were agreed to; the question of lunch and tea intervals is to be settled at a representative        conference.           On 23rd January, a strike of skilled engineers was in progress at Messrs. J. Sagar, Halifax,        because the firm refused to dismiss the whole of the women employed as turners, &amp;c.
