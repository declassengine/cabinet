                In addition to the ordinary Civil Employment   Form, a considerable number of applications has been   received from Employers under the speeding up ;Direct   Contract&apos; system.  The total number of applications of   this description received by the Exchanges amounts to   851,699 and of these 776,440 have been endorsed*                The excess of the numbers arriving in this   Country on leave over those returning was 22,616 during   the week ended 25th January.   The total excess since  the   date of the, Armistice now amounts to 144,612.UNEMPLOYMENT.                Unemployment Is still increasing at the rate of   roughly 70,000&quot; per week.  The total number of Out-of-Work   Donation Policies remaining lodged on the 24th January   amounted to 590,594 and of these Policies 62$ are held by   women and girls.  Details will be found In tho Appendix of   the unemployment in Industries covered by the 1911 and 1916   Acts, comparison being given with a week ago and a month ago.   These are summarised below;*                  Percentage of Unemployment in Industries                     covered by thenActs of ,1911 &amp; 1916   10th January                            7.80$   17th January                            8,76$   24th January                            9.52$                Unemployment in the Engineering and Iron Founding   Trade continues to rise, the total now being 172,454 or 12.44$.
Unemployment in Shipbuilding is now 10,597, (and having regardto the urgent necessity for increasing the output of Merchanttonnage, special enquiry is being made into this).       Owing to the large number of Policies issued to soldiersat Dispersal Camps, a comparison of Policies Lodged to PoliciesIssued Is not a very useful one.   If, however, the SoldierPolicies are excluded, the percentage is now(the same as theprevious week), viz., 61$.       The Divisions in which the most unemployment is foundare still the West Midlands, and the Horth Western.   In the formerunemployment is now 297 per 10,000 of population, and in thelatter 204.    In certain areas of these Divisions unemployment is now much in excess of 500 per 10,000 of population.       A large number of payments made on the 2l3t and 22nd.January have been analysed to show the number of payments which have already been made on these Policies and the followinganalyses these payments into four periods of time:- .Payments on 14th &amp; 15th   on 21st &amp; 22nd.21 -  3011 -  20Over 301 -10 daysit30.5 %                29. 1 %25.4 $                21. 5 %24.3 %                20. 6 $19.8 %                28. 3 %3*2.19 a(Sgd.)
