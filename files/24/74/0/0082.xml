                     (This Document  is the Pjm $MUvr,  1510,                    His Britannic iyiajeaty&apos;s Government.)            00-p-----/5.     WAR GRATUITY. RANK AND FILE AND LOWER DECK.&quot;i li^z   /*i           Half  Increment for Men in receiptADMIRALTY IgHQjMMM FOR THE WAR CABINET.         The scheme of Gratuities for Non-commissioned officers and Lien of the Army, Navy and Air Force providesthat where a nan is drawing pay and pension, he shall beentitled only to half the increment payable for war serviceafter the first yerr, viz. 5/- per month instead of 10/-per month for service overseas * and 2/6 per month insteadof 5/- per month for service at home.         The history of the matter is this.  The War .Office scheme was nrepared first:  submitted to the Committeeon Soldiers1 and Sailors1 Pay:  and adopted by the WarCabinet.   The Admiralty was&apos;then! nstructed to prepare ascheme on precisely similar lines.  (I have to admit with regret that I was present at the Soldiers1 and Sailors1Pay Committee which adopted the War Office scheme, andthat I overlooked the point now in issue; otherwise Ishould have resisted it T.JJL)         Directly our scheme was promulgated, complaintsbegan to he received that we were unjustly exploiting the pensioner.   The view of the Navy  held very strongly indeed,is that a Pension has been earned by service;  ana that itmust not be brought ia as a make-weight in any way inconnection with remuneration for further service;  I am bound to sayt hat I find myself in the most cordial and complete agreement with this proposition,         During the progress of the war, down to 1stOctober 1917, we did&quot;not pay pension to men who beeametime-expired during the war and were held to service^We gave them 2d a day for the first year, 4d a day for thesecond year, and 6d a day for the third year, &quot;detained pay&quot;in lieu of pension.  mhe agitation.respecting this procedure became so strong&apos;that amongst the concessionspromulgated on 1st October 1917 was an undertaking to paypay and pension to all men who became time-expired and were held to service, and to make the concession retrospectivein the cases of all men who had become time-expired sincethe outbreak of war, paying them the pensioJf^thev would otherwise have received, minus the detained nay-  whichthey had received.         This half increment policy is precisely the same.in principle;  and there can be no manner of doubt thatthe agitation in the Fleet will continue until it isrememed.   We have received prepresentations from the Fleet,forwarded by the Commander-in-Chief, in favour of the fullincrement to men receiving nav and pension, and these representations have been&quot;enforced fcv the Commander-in-Ohiefin personal conversation with me.   We are also told that the witnesses before the Jerram Committee speak very stronglyindeed on the half increment policy.
                                                   P      325         The Board of Admiralty most strongly representthe necessity to treat the man receiving pay and pension,in the matter of increment, precisely the same assail othets.         The cost to us will be about  70,000,         The War Office representatives on the Soldiers1  andSailors1 Pay Committee opposed this on the  -   . groundthat what the scheme does for the man in receipt of pay and pension is certainly no less favourable than the treatmentreceived by the officer in a similar position.  But theendeavour here to compare officer with man loses sight of  otherdifferentiations to which, so far as I know, it has not sofar been proposed by the War Office to give attention.For instance, the larger amount of the officer1s gratuityis held to be a justification for not giving the demobilisedtemporary officer, Army, Navy or Air Force, the right to  sixmonths1 unemployment donation.   In another direction thereis differentiation, viz. that whereas an officer receives  agratuity based on 61 days1 pay for each year of service,  he receives this amount irrespective of whether he has servedoverseas or whether he has served at home.  In the case of theman, however, the man who has not served st sea or overseasonly receives a monthly increment of half the amount ofthe man who has served at sea or overseas.         In any case there can be no doubt that the menconcerned feel very keenly about the matter and that theirviews are shared by the Fleet generally, who hold mosttenaciously to the principle already enunciated - the factthat a man is in receipt of a pension cannot equitably betaken into account in assessing the terms of. his furtherservice.
