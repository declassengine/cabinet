 SJBCRET,JA&apos;%/&amp;Y        MINISTRY    OF    FOOD.lli  Report  for  Week ending  Wednesday,  January 29, 1919.                        PART  I. ACTION  TAKEN.     Sir John  Beale, K.B.E., having  resigned  his position  as  First Secretary to theMinistry of Food, in order to take up  other Government work, the Food Controller has appointed Sir William Beveridge, K.C.B., hitherto Second. Secretary, to be permanent secretary to the Ministry of Food.                         RESUMPTION OF EXPORT TRADE.     With a view  to assisting the revival of this Country&apos;s Export Trade the ministry have notified the War Trade Department  that  they recommend that some 40 articlesof food, or classes of foodstuffs, should  be placed on the list of commodities which require to be licensed only (in effect) if exported to blockaded countries.  Among thefoodstuffs so notified to  the War Trade Department are the following: Tinned andPotted Meat, Meat  Extract, Canned  Fish (except  Salmon), Saccharin and articlescontaining it, Spices of  all  kinds,  Barley (pearled and pot), Biscuits,  Cakes, PotatoFlour, Vegetables (dried and preserved), Farina,  Cornflour, Macaroni, Sago and SagoFlour  and  Meal,  Spaghetti, Starch, Tapioca and  Tapioca Flour,  Imported Peas andBeans, Vermicelli, Prepared Foods wholly or partially derived from Cereals (except those containing Milk), Wines.     Consequent on  the view expressed by the Food Council that the free export trade of Bacon, Hams and Lard should be reinstated, the Treasury raise no objection to freeexport to all destinations other than Belgium, France, and  Italy, to which places, for reasons of exchange, they consider export should  not be licensed.  ,     The Food Council. Meetings  of the Council were held on Thursday, January23rd, and Tuesday,. January 28th.     In view of any  possible dislocation in the transport services, the Council  agreedto the proposal that householders should be allowed to hold  stocks of flour up toone sack.     It was decided to  ask the Agricultural  Organisation  Society if they would  beprepared to take over the three potato flake factories proposed to  be  set up in theEastern Counties.   The Council agreed that  the Treasury should be informed of thelarge exportable surplus of potatoes at present  in this country, and should be pressed to sanction the  sale  in any market.  It was further agreed  that the matter should bebrought to the  notice of the  Supreme Council of Supply and Relief  with a view totheir using the  potatoes  for relief purposes.     The Council  decided that further  urgent  representations  should be made to theTreasury on the subject  of the purchase of at least 11,000  tons of  Argentine butter.Unless the  Argentine supplies  can  be secured  the public will be faced with theprospect  of the  1 oz. ration of butter being continued during next autumn and winter.From May to August a  2 oz.  ration will be rendered possible, partly by improvedhome supplies.  The question whether a 2 oz. ration can be continued after Augustdepends on imports.     In view of the ample stocks of condensed milk, and of the raw materials for themanufacture of margarine, the  Council have agreed  that control of these two com-modities. should be relaxed at  an early date.  In both cases, however, it is proposedto retain Orders controlling prices. In the case of margarine it is proposed:      (1) That both rationing and distribution be discontinued ;     (2) That the General Requisition Order be maintained ;     (3) That Local  Committees should retain power to redistribute local stocks ;     (4) That manufacturers&apos; licences should be maintained, and rates of purchase of           raw materials be fixed by the Ministry, so long as  the  Ministry holds  or           controls  stocks of raw material;     (5) That the  coupon be discontinued  for the purchase of margarine a fortnight           before control is relaxed  in order  that retailers  may be able to estimate           their requirements.

\    T/ie Imports Board.-The Treasury have  intimated  that no  further purchasesare to be made in the United States, of bog products, frozen and preserved meat,condensed milk and oleo oil, out of existing credits without reaffirmation by them.    The following statement by the  Bacon Board with  reference to  the stocks ofbacon and hams was submitted to the Imports Board:          Stocks of bacon,  February 1st -     -                 42,500 tons.                     ,,   March 1st    -     -     -    -    -  55,500  ,,                         April 1st.....  42,500  ,,                     ,,   May 1st -     -     -     -    -    -   7,500  ,,    These figures are based on the  assumption:        (a) That 12,000 tons per  week- will arrive until all the Ministry&apos;s purchases             have arrived;       (6) That there is no export of any further quantity, other than the amount sold             to the Dutch;       (c) That  there is a  consumption of 35,000 tons monthly.    The Consumers1  Council.1  The  Council met on  Tuesday, January  28th.  Therepresentatives of the Council entrusted with the  settlement of the question of jamrationing circulated their  report showing that the final agreement arrived at had beenthat jam should be retained  on the coupon, but that surplus marmalade, and marmaladeonly,  should be  sold without the coupon.  The report was received and adopted.    The following resolution was moved and carried unanimously :-            &quot; That in  our opinion the suggestion to permit the increasing of the fixed       price of tea of  any  growth beyond the  price of 2s. Sd. per pound is exceedingly       dangerous, and  should not  be  permitted  under  any  circumstances  without       further consideration.  That the raising  of  the fixed price  in favour of China       tea gives an undue advantage over British-grown produce;  that discrimination       in favour of one growth against others is liable to lead to  fraud  and confusion,       and until tea is entirely free  from control, the fixed price of 2s.  Sd. per pound       should remain for all grades and all growths.&quot;    The Council approved the proposals relating  to  the  de-control of margarine onthe understanding (1) that the quality  of the  margarine suffered  no deterioration, and(2) that the distribution was satisfactory.   Consideration of the proposals relating tothe de-control of condensed  milk was postponed till the next meeting.    The  following  resolutions  by  the  Councils  Reforms  Sub-Committee  were submitted:  .    (1)  &quot; That the Consumers&apos; Council, recognising  the good work that in  the main            has  been done  by the  Ministry  of Food during  the  war, in  which, they            have been glad to support those measures which seemed satisfactory to the            community, considers that the continuance of its  existence is even more            important during the critical period we are coming to than it  was during            the war, and therefore declares that until all food control is  abolished, the            Consumers&apos; Council should continue to exercise its functions.     (2)  The Council  declares  that  for  the proper continuance of its.  work it is.            absolutely essential that no question of general policy should be  decided            upon, and no  definite action taken until all relevant facts are placed before            the Consumers&apos;  Council, and their views ascertained.     (3)  That in the opinion of the Sub-Committee it would be a grave danger to the            community, if,  in the circumstances now  existing,  the  powers and            activities of the  Ministry of Food  were  lessened, or if the efficiency of the            Ministry were in any way diminished.     (4)  That the attention of the Food Controller be called to the foregoing resolutions            by a deputation  from the Consumers&apos; Council.&quot;                            SUPPLIES  AND DISTRIBUTION.     Bacon  and Hams-The consumption  for this week is normal.   No furtherpurchases have been made in the United  States  or Canada  since  the Decemberprogramme.  Arrivals are a little smaller owing to the strike in New York, but stockshere are amply  sufficient to  meet all demands for bacon, hams, and lard.     On the discovery of a tendency on the part of traders to carry smaller stocks for fear of a fall  in  prices,  a notification was made  to  all  the  appointed importers/41
informing them that in the  event of any circumstances arising which&apos; made areduction in prices possible the Ministry would undertake either (a) to give not lessthan one montli&apos;s notice of the proposed reduction in prices to enable stockholders  to clear their stocks, or (b) in the event of the Food Controller finding himself  unable  togive the  month&apos;s notice  referred to,  he would undertake  to  make an allowance,equivalent to the reduction in price, on stocks  of one ton and over, in original packages,held by the trade.  A further letter  was despatched to all bacon and lard wholesalersenclosing a copy of the notification circulated to the appointed importers, and calling for a  return of the amount  of bacon, hams,  and lard  held by them on Saturday,25th January.   It is  hoped  that the above  measure will encourage traders to holdlarger  stocks.    Cocoa. Some  2,000  tons  of  raw  cocoa is  being  distributed this week  as an interim  allocation.   Arrivals  and  shipments  of  raw  cocoa  continue to  be very satisfactory.    Condensed Milk. The demand for condensed milk in 1918 reached&quot; a maximumin the  history of the industry.   The; chief causes were :    - (1) Y.M.C.A. Munition Canteens,  Prisoners of War Committee, Church Army           and similar organisations were large buyers, as liquid milk was unsuitable           for their establishments.    (2) Shortage of sugar and  jams.  The shortage resulted in  sweetened condensed           milk being extensively used  in domestic cooking, and otherwise in place           of sugar, jam,  and confectionery.    (3) Female employment.  Housewives of the poorer classes at work when fresh           milk is delivered, purchased  condensed milk for infant feeding and other           uses, as it remains good in the tin for three or four days.    (4) Shortage of liquid  milk during 1917 and  1918.    Condensed  milk supple-           mented supplies of liquid milk to a very considerable extent.    Dried Fraits. A meeting  of the  Dried Fruit Advisory Committee was held on.the 28th January, when it was  decided that a distribution of  dried fruit should bemade as soon as possible,  without waiting for further stocks to arrive.    Fish. The reports on the supply  of fish vary very much while in the  NorthernDivisions  the  supplies  are said to  be small,  in the  North-Western  they  are  well maintained ; the amount  landed at  Fleetwood  from the 1st to the  16th of January,inclusive,  was 12,927  boxes, of  which  16b were prime varieties, the  number of  tons-allocated was approximately 802.     .    In the North Midland Divisions in the  week ending  11th January, 119 vesselslanded 65,347  lbs. of prime fish  at Grimsby, all  of which was duly allocated andfetched full prices.   Owing to a strike the following week no boats went out.    In South Wales fish, is reported to be scarce, and the  Commissioner  points outthe need for more trawlers being made available with as little delay as possible.    From the West of Scotland comes the report that large supplies of herrings werebeing bought at the Kyles of Bute.   The average catch is said to be about 1,000 boxesa day.    Margarine. Ample stocks  of raw materials are  landed or in sight for a period of20 weeks.   British machinery is now capable of producing over 8,000 tons of margarineper week, and  by June this figure will be raised to 10,500 tons per week.  On theother hand the United Kingdom is  not likely at present to  absorb more than  7,000tons of margarine per week.   The full 5 oz. ration is, in fact,  not being taken up.    Meat.-Such complaints as are being received at the present time are largely dueto the  desire of the  retailers to secure the highest class  of  meat, in view of theopportunity which is being given to the public to transfer their registration.   It mustbe said that this opportunity has met with strong objection from  the retailers.  .   &apos; Complaints, which are received regarding the supply of frozen meat to agricultural and producing areas, may be taken as evidence that the system of distribution is now on a more equitable basis  than has hitherto been attained.  It is frequently necessaryto point  out to  Farmers&apos; Unions  and similar  bodies  that protests   against  thesubstitution of imported meat for the home-grown stock of the district display a short-sighted and selfish view of the conditions affecting the whole country.    In spite of  the comparative shortage of home-grown meat, the supplies as a whole are proving sufficiently plentiful to permit an increase in the ration in the near future.
It must&apos;be confessed that it is very doubtful whether  this increase will  go intoconsumption at  present prices, as, during  the  four weeks which ended on the 25thJanuary, the Ml amount of the existing ration was not taken up.     During the current week live stock supplies  are naturally being held  back in anticipation of the increase in  price which  comes into operation at the beginning ofFebruary.     Tea. All the teas which  were taken out of the  export sale last week have been sold.  As there has been a large demand  for further supplies, it has been decided tohold another sale of tea for export only, next week.                ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.     The following Orders have been revoked :            The  Beehive Sections (Maximum Prices)  Order,  1918. The import of       honey sections is now free to traders.                     *  .           The Gooseberries Sales (England and Wales) Order, 1918, and an amending       Order, dated 7 th June ; the Soft Fruit (Sales) Order, 1918 ; the Soft Fruit (Sales)       (Amendment) Order, 1918 ;  the Strawberries (Retail Prices)  Order,  1918; the       Plums (Sales)  Order, 1918; the Blackberries  Order,  1918;  and  the  Damson       (Sales) Order, 1918.     The revocation of the above Orders  abolishes control over these  summer fruits,and  the restrictions on their sale.     The Oatmeal (Restriction) Order, 1918, which prohibited  the use of oatmeal forother than human food.     The Feeding of Game  Order, 1917, which prohibited the feeding of game birdswith grain.                            ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.     During the week  ending the 11th of January, the  total  number of prosecutionswas  522, of which 491 resulted in convictions.     The prosecutions were reported under 64 different Orders.     Sentence of three months&apos;  imprisonment with  hard   labour  was. passed  at birmingham on  an  iron  moulder.   The  defendant  was  summoned  for  havingapplied for, retained,  and  used a ration  book in the name  of his  wife, who died  inSeptember 1917.          &apos;   PART II-SUMMARY  OF THE  FOOD POSITION.                                   IMPORTS.    The total imports  of  the principal foods and feeding-stuffs  in the week ended20th January (l^O320O tons) were 48 per cent, less than those of the preceding week(231,200 tons), and 35 per cent, less than the average of the first 21 weeks of the cerealyear (183,700 tons).     The heaviest fall was in cereals-wheat and flour (68,000 tons as equivalent wheat)being 36 per cent., and barley, oats, and maize (8,500 tons) 62  per cent, below the21 weeks&apos; average;  no rice  was entered.  Bacon imports (8,600 tons).were  less by17  per  cent., but  there  were  good imports of  meat (14,100 tons),  butter (3,900tons), and eggs (1,500 tons), as well&apos;as apples (5,200 tons), oranges (8,100 tons),  andonions (2,300 tons).  *                                        ,  ......   , .; r   -\

Meat. The rise of prices to producers induced a relatively large supply at thebeginning of January  and supplies  of home-grown meat in the second half  of themonth tended  to  fall  off.  As the issues of imported meat in the. week  endedJanuary  18th remained the same as in the  previous  week  (7,500 tons)  there wasa decrease in the&apos; total supply of  butchers&apos; meat for civilian consumption in GreatBritain.  Classes of meat no longer falling within the  ration now represent a con-siderable quantity,  estimated at 3,200 tons, and when allowance is made for  wasteand losses, the  estimated total consumption of rationed meat (under the higher ration of  four  coupons at 5d.) tends to fall  below the quantity  to  which the public areentitled.   The  rate of consumption, however, varies throughout&apos; the country,  beinghigher in industrial districts and particularly in the metropolitan area.    Fish. Supplies of fish at the principal inland  markets have been steady duringthe past three weeks at 2,300 tons.   Supplies  at Billingsgate market show a tendency to fall the decrease being 5 per  cent, in the  week ended January 11th, followed bya further decrease of  15 per cent, in the week ended January 18th.  They were also6 per cent, less than those of last year, a decrease due probably to the strike in the fishing industry in the ports supplying this market.                                    &apos; STOCKS.     Stocks  of meat  (beef, mutton and other meat) which had  been rising steadily from  74,800 tons  on 1st  October to  137,100 tons on 1st  January (Table D), have declined slightly to 134,500 tons on  the 18th January, owing to a  reduction of  4,100tons in  the  stocks of canned meat.  On the other hand, stocks of canned fish haveincreased to  23,300 tons, while stocks  of  bacon have increased from 46,400 tons on1st, to 56,200 tons on  the 18th January.  Cheese  stocks have fallen by  2,400 tons,and lard by 3,200 tons.   Condensed milk stocks,  which  rose  4,000  tons between january 1st  and 11th, fell 3,500 tons in  the week ended January 18th,  but they arestill high (34,100 tons).                                 RETAIL PRICES.     The increase in the prices of the principal  foods since July 1914 as recorded bythe Department of  Labour Statistics are given in Table E, the current prices showingan average increase of approximately 130 per cent.   The increase in the working-classexpenditure  on the same articles of food (having regard to changes in the generalconsumption of the various articles, and adjusted for&quot; time lag &quot;) maybe estimated at86 per cent.   Applying the same method of calculation, the expenditure of the generalpopulation shows an increase of 92 per cent.   The more favourable position, relatively, of the working classes would be brought out more prominently if non-controlJed and other  subsidiary foods were brought into the calculation.A 7191-1B
