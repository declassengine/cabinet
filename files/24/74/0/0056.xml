Hit mi^JgSS^^-.........             233            PROSECUTION OF SEDITIOUS  SPEAKERS.I fijS^&apos;  (Circulated by the  Home Secretary).      1 desire to have tho opinion.of the War  Cabinet on the question whetherprosecutions for seditious speeches should  be  instituted in present circumstances,    i  Mr, David Ramsay, a Shop Steward in tho  Amalgamated Society of Engineers/made a speech at a meeting of the Croydon Branch  of the &quot;Herald League&quot; in theOrpheum Cinema, Crsydon, on the 26th January,  &quot;The following are extracts fromthe Police notes of his speech:-      &quot;The economic conditions of the various  countries were driving the workers         into open revolt, the only solution being for the workers to take over         the control of production,   He  was proud to call-himself a Bolshevik.         It was Bolshevism that all the Allied Governments feared more than         anything else.      &quot;it is only by spreading the principles  of  Bolshevism and emulating the         example of our Russian and German  comrades and bringing about a rovol-,.         ution in this country that we&apos;will be able to link up three republics.      &quot;in a short time this country will  be engaged in a general strike for the         overthrow of capitalism,   Our friends on the Clyde have started already         and they have started ,woll.      &quot;The employers of this country will have to pay us any wages we like to         demand.      &quot;The master class will find that because they have shewn the workers how to         shoot the workers will use their knowledge of shooting,against the master         class cf the country, and then,  our revolution will be hero.      &quot;in order to bring about the downfall cf capitalism I am prepared to use         every means from the bomb to the ballot  box,   A few millions of         executions are nothing to the master  class, and, if the master class  ,         in this country is not prepared  to give  way to the working class of the         country, see to it that you are  not too  squeamish in your attitude to         them,It should be noted that the Orpheum Cinema  whore  this speech was delivered belongsto Miss Lilian Scott Troy, a close associate of the interned German Baron vonHorst, and that it is believed that before  the war these two endeavoured to get in touch with the leaders of labour disturbances  in this country and extremeNationalists in Ireland.      The view which I and my advisers were at first disposed to take was that,however mischievous the speech might be,  a  prosecution under D.R.R. 27 or 42would be likely to give it a wider currency.  Occasional prosecutions forseditious speeches advertise tho speakers without effectively suppressing the  evil,      The decision, however, to prosecute the  leaders of the Clyde strike some-what alters the position.   This speech is  linked up with  the Clyde disturbance(see the third extract above) and if the  Government decides on a general policyof prosecuting for seditious speeches and articles, it ought not to be passed over.   I find that the Director of Publio  Prosecutions, after consulting SirA. Bodkin, laid the speech before the Attorney General who was disposed to advisea prosecution subject to tho approval of the policy by myself and tho Minister
5th February,  1919,of Labour.                                                                *      I submit -   (l) that it is clear that tho speech contravenes D.R.H.  42,  and that-a prosecution would bo likely to result in a conviction and a substantialsentence;   (2) that if there is a prosocution in this case it ought to  bo  the be-ginning of a general policy of prosecuting for similar speeches (e,g, thosewhich John McLean is delivering in Lancashire towns);   (3) that the present emergency is so serious that it removes to a great extent the objection to prosecuting under a regulation which was passed asa temporary war measure;   (4) that the question whether to prosecute or not resolves itself into amatter of judgment! whether the deterrent, effect of successful  prosecutionswill or will not bo so great as to counterbalance the advertisement theywill give to revolutionary views, and the sympathy they will excite for labour leaders who, it will be alleged,&apos;aro imprisoned for  exercising thoright of free speech?
