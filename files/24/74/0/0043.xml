The question was considered by Lord  Cave,  and he decided that it was desirablo to maintain the Press Bureau for a time partly  in  connection  with  the Peaoe Conference and partly to keep a watch on  the use of press cables  for the purposes of Bolshevist propaganda. The staff, however, was somewhat reduced, and the instructions to the Pross were reduced from a bulky volume to a few pages,   Since then the Press have practically ceased to refor matter to  the Press Bureau, and the cablegrams have become fewer in number.      The need for censorship in  connection  with the Peace Conference has disappeared; and as regards Bolshevist  propaganda the number of cables to which exception has to be taken is very small  and does  not appear to  justify the labour and expense of examination.   Such propaganda is sent for  the most part by wireless, over which the War Office will continue to exercise control.   Another remaining function of the Press Bureau is to  distribute to the Pross  information on official subjects which is sent to them by the Government Departments.   In  this  respect the ^ress Bureau has,* I believe, fulfilled a useful service, and  this part of tho work could be continued with a very small staff if such  a course were thought  desirable;  and it could be the means, by circulating information,  of  keeping every Department aware of the public announcements of other departments,      The Directors  very properly point out  to me  that  their work does not now justify the cost to the public of  keeping their office open and employing a large number af clerks and messengers,1 and they  ask permission to give a month^s notice to their staff, to close their office and save  tho cost.      I agree with their recommendation,  and the only difficulty that I foresee is the possible effect in  Ireland, whero I understand the Lord Lieutenant wishes to maintain the censorship.  To got over this  difficulty I suggest that instead of bringing the censorship here absolutely to an end it might be  suspended from, say, the 1st Liarch,. The public notice might be somewhat as follows:-   Af Pro   flf the      &quot;This suspension doos not imply any change in tho provisions of the Defence of   the Realm Acts or in the Regulations made tnereundor, but. the responsibility for   seeing that-they  are complied  with as regards publication will rest with the   publishers,  .      I hope the  Cabinet will take this opportunity of  rocording their appreciation of the excellent work  performed by  Sir Frank Swettenham,  Sir Edward Cook and thoir staff. The work has been exacting, often done under groat pressure and involving long hoursI both night and day  on tho  part of the  staff.   The questions to bo decided haveIfrequently required the exorcise of discretion and tact.   The relations maintainedI between the Press Bureau and the Press have been  most  cordial.   It is an additionalI testimony to the Directors that  thoy have loyally borne public criticism for actionsfin which they have  been merely giving  effect to the decisions of other Departments,f February, 1919.
