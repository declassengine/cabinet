(Appendix C),      (3) The printed  Reports/  of the Civil Aerial Transport          Committee a3 presented to the Air Council,            Since the date  of that letter the Draft Convention  has been further revised  and Annexes added dealing with  log-books  and rules of the air, while the original Annex !,b&quot;  dealing with Certificates of Navigability of Aircraft has  been omitted on the view  that  the details of these  Certificates are best left to  each contracting State.            The prenoh  Government have proposed that an Inter-  national Conference should assemble in Paris to deal with  this subject on the 10th  proximo.  It will, however, not be -  possible to present an agreed  draft for the whole British  Empire on  that date unless the concurrence of the DominionI  and Indian Governments and the approval cf the war CabinetI  have been  previously  obtained.  As regards the Indian%  .and Dominion Governments, the  only reply yet received has  been that  of Australia concurring in the original Convention  as 3ent to the War  Cabinet on  21st November,  It appears  to the Council, however,  that  possibly the presence of  representatives of  the Dominion and of the Indian Govern-  ments in the War Cabinet  now  sitting in Paris might afford  a means of obtaining&quot;;&quot;&apos;&quot; even in &quot;this&apos;short interval, the  concurrence of their  respective Governments.  I em therefore  to request that in  submitting  the. enclosed Draft Convention (28 copies  of which  are forwarded herewith) for the approval  ^L^AJLaJL^^ine,ti this  possibility may be brought to the  notice immediately  of the British.Jtapire Delegation in Paris.

Aircraft wishing to land  at night  on  aerodromeshaving a ground control shall         Fire a green Veryfs light or flash a  green lamp;in addition shall make the number  of the  aircraft by Morsthe tail lamp may be used for  this purpose.
65         Permission to land will be given by the repetition ofits number from the ground followed by         A green Very1s light  or  Plashing a green lamp.    15,  The firing of a rod Very *a light or the display ofa red flare from the ground shall be taken as an instructionthat aircraft are not to land until fresh permission has beengranted.    16.  An aircraft compelled to land at night shall fire ared Very1s light or make a scries of short flashes with thenavigation lights.    17.  When aircraft are in sight of one another, an aircraftunder way, in taking any course authorised or required bythese Rules, may indieato that course by the followingsignals J*    One white Very&apos;a light  - fI am directing my course to                               starboard&apos;*    Two white V^ry^ lights - &apos;I am directing my course to -                               port&apos;.  -  18.  When an aircraft is in distress and requiresassistance the following shall bo the signals to be used ordisplayed either together or separately    (1)  The international signal S.O.S. by means of visual         or wireless signals.    (2)  The international code signal of distress indicator         by NC.    (3)  The distant signal, consisting of a square flag,         having cither above or below it a ball or anything         resembling a ball;    (4)  A continuous sounding with any sound apparatus.    (5)  A signal consisting of a succession of Very&apos;s         lights, fired at short internals.    19.  In the event of fog or mist rendering aerodromesinvisible, their presence may be indicated by the firing ofa rocket or rockets with coloured stars.III.  RULES OP THE AIR.    20.  Risk of collision can when circumstances permit be ascertained by carefully watching the compass^ bearing andangle of elevation of an approaching aircraft.   If neitherthe bearing nor angle of elevation appreciably change, suchrisk should be deemed to exist.    21.  The term &apos;risk of collision1 shall include risk of injury due to undue proximity of other aircraft.   Everyaircraft that is required by these rules to give way to&quot;another to avoid collision shall keep a safe distance havingregard to the oircumstances of the case.
m Q -    22.  When two flying machines  are meeting end on,  or nearly end on, or when  two  airships,are  meeting end on or nearly end on, so as to involve  risk of  collision each shialter its course to starboard, so  that each may pass on flport side of the other.         This article only  applies to cases where aircraft are meeting end on, or  nearly  end  on, in such a manner asinvolve risk of collision,  and does not  a^ply to two aircwhich must, if both keep on their   respective courses, paclear of each other.         The only cases to  which it does apply are when eof the two aircraft is  end  on, or  nearly end on, to the otin other words; oto cases in which each  aircraft is in suposition as to see both the side-lights  of the other.         It does not apply,  by day, to cases in which an aircraft sees another ahead crossing its own course;  ornight,, to cases where the red  light of one aircraft is opto the red light of the other, or  where  the green light no one aircraft is opposed to  the green light of the other owhere ? red light without a green  light, or a green lightwithout.a rod light, is seen ahead, or where both greenred lights are seen anywhere but ahead.    23.  When two flying machines  are crossing, or v/hen tairships are crossing so as to involve risk of collisionaircraft which has the  other on  its star-board side shallout of the way of the other.&apos;    24.  When a flying machine,  and  an  airship are procein such directions as to involve risk of  collision,  the flying machine shall keep out  of the way  of  the airship.    25.  Where by any  of  these  Rules  one of the two aircis to keep out.of the  way,  the  other  shall keep its coursand speed.Note:- When in consequence  of thick weather,  or other ca       such aircraft finds  itself  so  close that collisio       cannot be avoided  by the action,of the giving way       aircraft alone,  it shall take  such action as will       aid to avert collision.   (See  paragraphs 33 and 3C    26.  Every aircraft which is  directed  by these  Ruleskeep out of the way of another aircraft  shall,  if thecircumstances of the  case  admit,  avoid crossing ahead  ofother..    27.  Notwithstanding anything contained in these. Ruleevery aircraft,  overtaking any other,  shall keep out-of tway of the  overtaken aircraft.        &apos; Every&apos;aircraft coming up.,with another aircraft tany direction more than 110- degreesfrom ahead of the legislation.e. in such a  position with, reference to the  aircraft whiit is overtaking, that  at  night it would be unable to seeeither of that  aircraft1 a  sidelights,  shall be deemed toan^overtaking aircraft;   and  no subsequent alteration of tbearing between, the  two aircraft  shall make the overtakiaircraft a  crossing  aircraft within the meaning of theseor relieve  it of the.duty  of keeping -clear of  the  ovor^aircraft until  it-ia finally, past&apos;and.  clear.
85         As by day the overtaking aircraft cannot always knowwith certainty whether it is forward or abaft this directionfrom the other aircraft, it should, if in doubt, assume thatit is an overtaking aircraft and keep out of the way.    28.  In following an officially recognised aerial route,every aircraft when it is safe and practicable shall keep tothe starboard side of such route,    29.  All other aircraft shall keep out of the way of balloonswhether fixed or free.    30.  All aircraft on the land or sea about to ascend shall remain stationary until there is no risk of collision withalighting aircraft.    31,  Every aircraft manoeuvring on land under its ownpower shall as regards, other aircraft on the ground conform tothe rules laid down for aircraft in the air.   (See also paragraph 36),    52.  Every aircraft in a cloud, fog, mist, or other conditions of bad visibility shall proceed with caution havingcareful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.    33.  In obeying and construing these^Rules, due regard shallbe had to all dangers of navigation and collision, and toany special circumstances which may render a departure fromthe above Rules necessary In order to avoid immediate danger.IV.  GENERAL.    34,  Every aircraft manoeuvring under Its own power on thewater shall conform to the Regulations for Preventing Collisionsat Sea and for the purposes of those regulations shall be deemedto be a steam vessel but shall carry the lights specified in these rules and not those specified for steam vessels in theRegulations for Preventixr. of Collisions at Sea, and shall not use, except as specified in paragraph 18 above, or be deemed to hear the sound signals specified in those Regulations,    35.  Nothing In these Rules shall exonerate any aircraft orthe owner, pilai&apos;or crew thereof, from the consequences of anyneglect to carry lights or signals, or of any neglect to keep a proper look-out, or of the neglect of any precaution which may berequired by the ordinary practice of the air, or by the specialcircumstances of the case.    36.  Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with theoperation of any special rule or rules duly made and publishedrelative to navigation of aircraft In the immediate vicinity ofany aerodrome or other place.
