Senior- Asst. Secretary222MEMORANDUM.    Under section  twenty-nine  of  the  Representation of  thePeople Act, it is provided that expenses  of returning officers, ifwithin the prescribed scale, are to be paid out of moneys providedby Parliament.   When the necessary vote was  moved before thelast general  election, the  point  was  taken that  if  Parliamentrefused to  vote the necessary money a  general  election could not he held, and it is argued that from this it follows  that the rightof the executive to secure the dissolution  of  Parliament wheneverit so desires is seriously impaired if  not  absolutely abolished.  Itis proposed,  therefore, in the present  Bill, that these expenses,instead of &quot;being  subject to  a vote, should  be a permanent charge on the Consolidated Fund.23-3
