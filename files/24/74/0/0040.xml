MOGGRIDGE, C.B., Assistant  Secretary, Board of Trade.MR. C. R. EDDISON, Board of Trade.MR. THOMAS JONES, War Cabinet (Acting Secretary).     SIR ALBERT  STANLEY stated that at a meeting of the War Cabinet on Fridayafternoon he had referred to two questions which were troubling the railway world :the  question of an eight-hours day and the complete  recognition of the  RailwayClerks&apos;&apos; Association.   He thought that the former had been settled, but the second was still undecided.   He had, at the request of Mr. Bonar Law,  prepared a  memorandum for the Prime Minister upon it, and the present Conference, had  been  summoned  at mr. Bonar Law&apos;s suggestion with a view to drawing up recommendations which might be laid before the War Cabinet on the following day.  A mass  meeting  of the clerkswas to be held on Tuesday night to decide upon their action.     The Railway Clerks&apos;, Association had been formed  some twenty years ago, and was at first  composed  only  of  the  lower grades of  the  clerical staff employed on therailways.   It had gradually grown  in numbers and widened considerably the gradesbrought within  its  membership, and to-day included not only  ordinary clerks butconfidential and chief clerks and stationmasters, so that  among  its 72,000 members were a considerable number of men  occupying executive positions.  For some timethe  union  had  tried to  obtain recognition for this supervisory staff and had beendenied.   Some  companies refused recognition altogether;  others offered a limitedrecognition, provided agreement was reached as to the grades to be recognised.  Duringthe war repeated efforts  had been made to secure  full recognition,  and these effortsculminated on Thursday  last  in a  deputation which he  had received at the Board  ofTrade.[1048]B
    The union claimed that it was not for the  railway companies to say who should or who should not be included in it.   He had  told the union that, as advised by theRailway Executive, he could not recognise the union for the purpose of negotiation onbehalf of  the stationmasters, agents, and other members of the supervisory staff.   he offered to refer the matter to the War Cabinet  or to bring together representatives ofof the two sides in  order  to  consider where  the  line might be  drawn between  the grades which might, and the grades which might not, be included  for purposes of recognition.   In reply to a question which he had put  to Mr. Walkden, the  general secretary, Mr. Walkden said that the union claimed to be free to enrol all members ofthe supervisory  staff except perhaps a score of  officials throughout the  kingdom atthe very top  of the service.  In reply to a further question as to whether the unionproposed later on to demand that every man in a particular grade must join the union.no definite answer was  given, and Mr. Walkden stated  that the question had not yetbeen considered.    Sir Albert Stanley, proceeding, said that the principle now at issue was the mostvital  that had been  raised since the inception of trade unionism.   It was whetherevery man in the. railway  service, whatever  his  position in that service, from  thegeneral manager downwards, was to enjoy  an undisputed right of selecting for himselfthe trade union to which he should belong, and that that union should  be entitled torepresent  his interests.   If that principle  were  conceded, then the discipline of  therailways would be most seriously menaced, and, in the  opinion of railway managers,would disappear.   The responsibility of  the railways would  be transferred to  theunion, and men in the  responsible grades  would be mixed up  into one organisation with their subordinates.  Hitherto that principle had been resisted.    SIR HERBERT WALKER stated that prior to  the war the railway companies,with one or  two exceptions, did not recognise the railway clerks&apos; union.   When  theRailway Executive was instituted for purposes  incident to the war,  they did not feel ina position to  commit any company  to  the recognition  of the union by recognising itthemselves.   During the last year there  had been  one meeting between the railway executive and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, and they were told that the railway executive were  prepared to  recognise them  if  it were clearly understood  that  the supervisory staff were not included.  The negotiations fell through on this point.     Recently the position had  altered, inasmuch  as the Government had  invited theRailway Executive to act on its behalf, and to meet the National Union of railwaymen and the Union of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen to discuss  permanent conditionsof service and rates of pay.   Obviously such discussions might  prejudice the generalrailway position after the war, and in common fairness  the Railway Executive musthave  dealings with  the Railway Clerks&apos;  Association, and the  crucial  question thenarose as to how far the association was to be allowed to represent the supervisory staff.From the  point of  view  of  discipline, it must  be remembered  that  numbers of confidential  documents  in the shape of  reports  from  stationmasters  and policesuperintendents, and dealing with matters  atiecting the staff were constantly being sent  up to superintendents of the line or goods  managers, and on to  the general manager.   At each stage they had to  be handled  by confidential clerks, and. it  wasunthinkable that such clerks should be in the same union as the  men  whose conductwas being reported upon.  There had been cases  where such documents had been communicated to secretaries of trade unions.     SIR ALBERT STANLEY said that he had mentioned that point to the deputation and it had been repudiated.   The Secretary stated that no instance of such breach ofconfidence had been brought to his attention.     MR. IDLING WORTH said that such  incidents had  been known in the Post Office,and he had taken strong action in consequence.     SIR  HERBERT WALKER, proceeding,! said that in any case the fact that thevarious grades were in the same union would put an end to discipline.     SIR  ALBERT STANLEY stated that the  reply of the  Association was that theUnion  was  arranged in sections,  so that certain men, e.g., stationmasters were in one section, and  a  lower  grade in another section.  Hence, they claimed,  it  could nothappen that a branch would be presided over by a clerk when a  stationmaster&apos;s  case would be under consideration.   This would seem to indicate that  the association itself recognised the necessity for differentiation of grades.      MR. WARDLE thought that the movement towards forming sections had grown up during the last two or three years.
     SIR HERBERT WALKER, continuing, urged that the question of discipline was paramount.  The  level of discipline maintained  on  our railways was the explanation for our comparative freedom  from accident.  American officers visiting this country were always amazed at the contrast which our methods offered to theirs.   Discipline was only maintained by having breaches of it regularly reported, and  by taking steps to  deal with such breaches.   As it was there were signs of deterioration, in so far  as drivers, firemen, guards, and signalmen were now in one union.  There were  fewer reports of cases of running past signals.     A large number of stationmasters were still on the wages list and belonged  to the National Union of Railwaymen, though they were not represented by it.  They were men who had joined the union when they were on the lower grades.   The companies did not ask them  to leave the union so long  as they took no prominent part  in  its work.   In other cases  the  companies allowed unrecognised associations of  particular grades, and the companies would feel it to be a breach of faith to ignore such unions. No doubt the railway clerks were hoping to force all such into one union their own.     MR.  ILLINGWORTH stated  that in  the Post Office there were about sixty different unions, and his deliberate policy was to keep the grades quite separate.   In fact, in cases of dispute he himself decided to which union a particular grade should belong.     SIR  ALBERT STANLEY  said that it might  help the Conference if he  read  an extract from a statement made by Mr. Walkden when the deputation came to the  Board of Trade last week.     &quot; We suggest to you  that that is quite a mistake ; that if those companies  could have their way and split the supervisory staff into two and forced down the younger and less responsible men into this association it would not  be  likely to stop there.   In all probability they would decide  to go  rather further  than, perhaps, the companies themselves would  care.    They would go further down and  join  hands with the operative grades ;  but in any case, whether they did that or not, the  split up of the: supervisory staff into two sections would develop between those two sections a spirit of hostility,  of enmity,  and  of antagonism  which would be  very bad  indeed for the business.   We have endeavoured to promote a spirit of solidarity amongst all.   When the chief goods clerk is a member the  whole staff support him better than they did before.  No disciplinary difficulties arise on account of membership in this union.   I have been secretary  for  about twelve years  now, and I  know  of no cases  where difficulties of that character have occurred.   I was a goods agent before, and  I had  no difficulties in the office.&apos;   I was chairman of  the local branch, but  that  made  no difference to the carrying out of my duties.   When I was at Nottingham in the district managers office, and dealt with  claims, it was often the case that something had been done amiss which had landed  the company into a rather big claim, and it was two or three times the case that members of the association were involved, but that  would not and did not influence me in any  way whatever with regard to the way those cases were dealt with.  If those men stood in need of being reprimanded they were reprimanded,. and of  course that would  take place in  any instance.   We are now concerned so much with the new relationships.  We do not work at individual cases of grievances ; we try to confine ourselves to large propositions which affect  the whole of our members in a broad way.  We   do not want to interfere  at  all with the  internal  work.   In fact I ,go  so far  as  to say that we do not  think  it would be worth while  to set  up an elaborate  scheme  of  Whitley  councils to drift into discussing  a lot  of things that can be decided by competent men without discussion.  We  do not want to  inflict on the railway  interest an infinity of committees; we  want to be as expeditious and direct as possible.  We suggest to you that if we are given full, frank, and friendly recognition for these unacceptable restrictions it will make for good.   We are anxious to work in a friendly and  harmonious  manner  with the management, and we do not want a lot of machinery or formality to  do it.  We want things to be as straightforward and as businesslike as possible.&quot;     SIR  ALEXANDER  BUTTERWORTH said that on.  the North-Eastern  Railway he did not think there had been any suggestion from the foremen that  they  should  be represented by the National Union of Railwaymen.  The only question at  issue had been the range of  departments to be included in the foremenV association, and  the company had allowed  the  association to spread itself beyond one department.   The company had encouraged  this association, but had not originated it.   With  regard  to the Railway Clerks&apos; Association,-they had opposed one of the Bills of the North-Eastern Company  some years ago.  In those days all the  railway companies were opposed to/
permitting membership  in  it chiefly on two grounds (1) the fear that the association would join up with the National Union of Railwaymen, and (2) the difficulty ol! drawingthe line between the rank  and file and the supervisory staff.   In those days the only question was where to draw the line; there  was not then, as now, a  claim for the drawing of  no  line.  This was a new feature.   Comparatively recently he had cometo the conclusion that the time for recognising the  Railway Clerks&apos; Association had arrived, as  such  a  body would be  useful in representing the  views of the clerical staff.   The  issue now was not  one of recognition, but of an  entirely  new claim torepresent the supervisory  stall.  Some  seven or eight  years  ago  an  attempt hadjointly been made  to draw up a list of grades that  might  be  recognised within theunion, but the attempt had broken  down, and finally it had been agreed to allow thegeneral manager to  veto any particular grade and even a particular clerk.     It was true that  at present the railway clerks had  decided not to affiliate withthe wages grade, but there was nothing to  prevent  it doing so at  a later date, andthe tendency towards affiliation and federation was widespread.  Further, if the rightof the Railway Clerks&apos; Association to  represent stationmasters was conceded, the sameright would have to be extended to the National Uuion of Railwaymen to represent thestationmasters who  belong to it.     MR.  ILLINGWORTH  asked  whether  stationmasters  did, in fact, wish  to  berepresented by the  Railway Clerks&apos; Association, and  in reply it was stated that, out of8,800 stationmasters, 5,300 belonged to the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, and only some880 to the National Federation of Stationmasters.     MR.  BRIDGEMAN  read  a declaration  which  had been  signed by over 5,000stationmasters  asking  that  they should  be  represented  by the Railway  Clerks&apos;Association.     SIR  ALBERT STANLEY said that he had made it perfectly clear to the deputa-tion that there  was  no dispute as to the recognition of the union, so far as the represen-tation&quot; of the lower grades  of  the clerical  staff was concerned as  distinct from the supervisory staff.  He had assured them that the Railway Executive  looked  at thematter entirely from  the  point of view of discipline and public safety, and for these reasons  they felt  bound to distinguish between  the  supervisory staff  and thosesupervised.     Sir Albert Stanley then referred to a statement recently  made by a Minister to theeffect that the Government had  decided to nationalise the  railways.  This statement had created a great deal of unrest, and had stimulated all the selfish instincts of share-holders and railwaymen alike.  The Government had not, in fact, reached a decision onthe future  of  the  railways, but had agreed, for some time at least, that the railways would have to be administered, in some  sense, by a department of  the Government;there must be a closer connection with  the Government  than existed before the war.A definite pledge had been given that the guarantee to shareholders should continue for two years after  the signing of peace.  If, now the claim of the clerks was conceded,the Government would be forced to grant  the same right throughout the services.   Hecould not too strongly emphasise the gravity of the issue.     SIR JOSEPH MACLAY said the issue must be faced.  On the whole, he thought the men were right.  If the great majority of  the supervisory staff were already in theunion, and only some  800 stationmasters outside it, the public  would certainly not stand by the Government in a fight.  In the long run, the Government would be boundto recognise whichever union the men selected  for themselves.  He had  no fears of stationmasters mixing  and sitting with tbe other grades.   Men had a certain self- respect, and a stationmaster would want  to maintain the rights of  his position.   He did not think they  need fear any serious leakage of private information.   In any case, he was clear the Government could not face the country on the issue now raised.      MR. WARDLE said that, having been a railway clerk for eighteen years, he might presume to know something of  railway organisation.  He could- not understand  how the Government were to avoid granting recognition to the clerks.    He  himself,  when 17-1 years of age, had a clerk under him,  and when his  own chief  was away he dealt with all correspondence.   There were thousands of  offices on the railways  where the staff was quite small, and where, in the absence  of the stationmaster, the  chief clerk acted for him.   To cut out the supervisory staff from the union by  some arbitrary line would prove quite  impracticable.      The association,  by  forming sections, had themselves  recognised that there were differences  between the several grades, and in that way had gone some distance to meet
the objections  of  the  railway companies.  It was impossible  to have  a  surgicaloperation and cut the stationmasters out of the  union or to give them truncated  rightswithin the union.   He thought detailed arrangements could be made within the  union,and by it, which would fairly meet the apprehension of the Railway Executive.   TheNational Union of Railwaymen were willing to part with the stationmasters enrolled bythem  to the  railway clerks.   He  had discussed  matters with Mr. Walkden on theprevious day, and he had not taken up an  absolutely  irreconcilable line.   The NationalUnion of Railwaymen  would not oppose the transfer of  their clerical  to the clerks&apos;association.   Whether  the clerks would join with the National Union of Railwaymenwould depend a great deal on the Governments decision  in the present conflict.  Wewere  living  in new  times.   The  supervising  staff would  insist  on  having its organisation, and it would be better frankly to recognise that fact and look to  them tosee that proper discipline was  supported.   If they  were excluded from recognition that  would not in itself prevent leakage of confidential  information.   The station-masters at the moment  were in a bad temper, and unless some reasonable compromisewas reached there might be serious trouble within 48 hours.    MR. WARDLE, in reply to a question, said  that he  gathered  that Mr. Walkdenwould be willing to exclude from the association the  staff of the  general managersoffice  which dealt with questions of high policy.    SIR ALEXANDER  BUTTERWORTH said that questions  of  discipline  and questions of privacy and confidence were distinct.  The  latter was less serious thanthe former.   The  position of a stationmaster was  one of authority, and  it was his duty to bring men  to book and to report  On their efficiency and  conduct.  Were theGovernment prepared to recognise not only on the railways, but throughout the largeindustries,  the  right of a  trade union to  represent all grades?  If that was the viewof the House of Commons, there was no more to be said.    SIR ROBERT HORNE agreed that the proposal was  of a  very far-reachingnature, and if conceded similar demands could not be refused.  At the present time there was no uniform practice throughout the country.  He  had  before him  recentlyconcrete examples which were significant.  A foreman in one of  the shipyards  wherethe Government were urging the adoption of  piecework, had been fined 20Z. by hisunion for allowing a premium bonus system to continue in the yard. In  another  yard aforeman had twice been fined for reporting adversely on a  member of the union.   Suchcases were of  course exceptional, and good  sense usually prevailed.  In a great manyunions foremen were members, and were sometimes represented  by the  unions; inother cases the employers  forbade  such  representation.   Some shipyards encouragedunions confined to foremen.   In the cotton trade the  men and  the foremen were inseparate unions, but the unions were federated.   Some time ago Sir George Askwithhad  been  asked to arbitrate  on  the position  of firemen employed by the LondonCounty Council who were members  of the  National Union of. Corporation Workers.He  decided  that  the  firemen might   remain  in  the  union,  but  should form aseparate section, and the firemen might appoint their own spokesmen to representthem  on questions  in which  they  specially  concerned.   Similar  difficulties wereagitating the  Electrical Trade Union and their relation  to  the  supervisory staffs ofthe power  stations.     Sir Robert Home, continuing, said the Government were bound to  recognise that over  5,000 stationmasters were already  in  the Railway  Clerks&apos;  Association.   It wasvery  difficult, therefore, to refuse  recognition, and particularly at a moment when thewhole  industrial  policy  of the , Government was to  stand by the trade  unions and  support their leaders.   Possibly some modifications and safeguards might besecured, as suggested  by Mr. Wardle.   There had never been a case where a unionclaimed recognition and the Government  had finally refused to grant it.     LORD MILNER  said  he saw great  difficulties  in refusing to  recognise thestationmasters who were already in the union.   He thought  it would be better  to try to come to an understanding with  the unions so as to secure:  (1) that they  should avoid trying  forcibly to extend their boundaries ; and (2)  that they should avoid trying to suppress other existing unions which contained certain grades or classes for whomrecognition was claimed within the larger union.     MR. WARDLE did not think the railway clerks would interfere with the existingsmall and  specialised associations to which Lord Milner  referred.   They objected tothe companies favouring them, and asked for freedom to recruit members generally.       [1048]                                                           C
     SIR ALBERT STANLEY agreed that the association might be willing to modify its demands in the course of negotiation, but at the  moment they, were claiming that practically every person on  the pay roll  should be eligible for  membership in  the union.  If that claim were  admitted, then sooner or later the union would endeavour to make it a condition of employment that every one shall  join the union.   On that point he had not received a satisfactory answer.   The pressure on officials  to  join  the union would become irresistible.     SIR JOSEPH  MACLAY  said that in his opinion it was desirable that the higher grades should be included in the union with the lower grades because of the restraining influence they would tend to exercise.     SIR  ALBERT STANLEY  urged that, had that, been  true  in practice, there would have been fewer  difficulties with the trade unions.  The majority of the men in the  unions do not,  in  fact, exercise a restraining  influence.  There was little or no difficulty with responsible leaders ;  the difficulty arose with  the branch  secretaries, who actively fomented agitation.   Presently there would be  a demand that  seniority should  be  the only qualification  for promotion, and if that  were  refused  the men would want to set up their own machinery for determining promotion.  In fact, if  the Government gave in now they would be projected into a new industrial world.     LORD MILNER pointed  out that in this  particular case it was a responsible leader who was seeking  recognition for his union.     MR. BRIDGEMAN could not see how, if recognition were refused, discipline was likely to improve.     SIR HERBERT WALKER  admitted that it was difficult  to meet the point of  the 5,000 stationmasters.  No doubt many had been  promoted from lower grades and had not ceased  to be members of the union.  During the war the  Railway Executive had been preoccupied with  other business, and had tacitly  allowed the  stationmasters to join the clerks&apos; association.  It was therefore difficult  to interfere now when their right to join had not been challenged.     MR. SHORTT  asked Avhat  would happen supposing differences arose  between the stationmasters and the clerical staff.     MR. WARDLE replied that there would be separate sections and conferences and the general secretary would have to act on their behalf.     MR. SHORTT  said that his experience in Durham  had  been that the coal-owners were unwilling to allow the miners&apos; federation to represent the  deputies who were members of it.     MR. WARDLE suggested that stationmasters and railway  clerks were much more closely interlocked than deputies and miners.     MR. SHORTT  thought that the  real question at issue was  interference with discipline, and did not see how numbers affected the principle one way or another.     LORD MILNER said that if all were  in the  one union there would inevitably arise special formations of  group or  grade interests within the union.  There probably had to be a fight with extremists, but this  was not a  good ground to select.   It would be better to fight for the maintenance of the eight-hours working day.     SIR HERBERT WALKER  hoped  the. Government  had already won  on that issue.     SIR ALEXANDER BUTTERWORTH  said that ^ if the  business  men of  the country were content to have all grades  in one trade union it was news to him, and if that was the view of the  Government then the Railway Executive and the public should be  informed  that it. was the deliberate national policy of the Government.   Such a declaration was due to the railway managers.     SIR DAVID  SHACKLETON said that just as much trouble could be caused  by declaring that all men must be in one union as by declaring the opposite.  Everyone knew the struggle which was at present going ori between  the craft unions  and  the industrial  unions.   In the case of the clerks there were already over 60 per cent, of  the administrative staff  in the., union.  Would discipline break down when the  percentage was  70  or  80  per cent, or when?  There were whole  sections of railway systems at present  with every stationmaster in the union, but discipline had not  disappeared.
    SIR ALBERT STANLEY replied that discipline had not hitherto broken  downbecause the union had  not  been recognised,  but when  the  union came  forward  torepresent the demands of the stationmasters,  then the crisis with regard to disciplinewould arise.    SIR DAVID  Shackleton dissented, because at that stage each of  the variousgrades AVOUM have their respective views, and  these would probably conflict and tendto cancel each other.  The present case was that of a union  asking for the right  torepresent members which already belonged to it.    MR. XL LING WORTH  said that the  position revealed  by the  discussion wasdifferent from what he at first thought.   If there were to be separate sections withinthe union then they could be trusted to do a lot of fighting amongst themselves.    MR. WARDLE thought an  undertaking  could be obtained from the associationthat separate sections would be continued.  There had recently been  a sectionalconference of stationmasters.   He had asked Mr. Walkden if it would be possible fora stationmaster to be summoned to  appear before a branch composed of clerks, and hehad been told that this would not be possible, and he (Mr. Wardle) thought an under-taking might be obtained on  that point,    SIR ALEXANDER  BUTTERWORTH  suggested  that,  in  the light  of thediscussion,  the most practical step was  to  try and  see  what was  the  least harmfulsacrifice that the Railway Executive might  offer.   If  a clear negative was not to bereturned to the men&apos;s demand, and the Government were  convinced that a fight couldnot be faced, then the  Railway Executive must try to  minimise  the  evil which would follow from that  decision.   He admitted that if the  companies  had recognised  thisunion ten years ago the present difficulty would not  have  arisen.   Even now it mightnot be too late to obtain a promise from the union that it would not  press for the  rightto compel men to  join.    LORD MILNER  said that a decision was of the utmost urgency.    SIR JOSEPH MACLAY suggested that there might be a meeting of the Cabinetthat afternoon.    SIR ALBERT STANLEY said that he had told Mr. Walkden that the Governmentwould give  him their decision in time for the meeting on Tuesday night.    After some further discussion, Sir Albert Stanley said he  thought the  conference would like Sir Herbert Walker and Sir Alexander Butterworth to discuss  the matter with their colleagues on the Railway Executive on the following morning, in order  tosee if they  could make any helpful suggestion  on the lines indicated  by the discussion which had just taken place.    Speaking for himself, Sir Albert continued, he  saw no solution except completeacceptance  or complete  rejection, but possibly  the Railway  Executive could find a middle course which the  trade union would not refuse.  Ultimately the Governmentwould  be faced with the demand for complete  recognition, and the demand that nocompany should  have  the right to employ any  man  who was not  a&apos; member of theunion.   &quot; None of us would willingly agree to this  proposition, but we agree because we are compelled  to,&quot;  perhaps summed up  their  attitude at that meeting.  With everydesire  to secure the  best for all affected, they  did not believe this  was the sort  ofmachinery to realise the best. One could only bow to it as one would to a hurricane.    LORD  MILNER  said that he could not pretend to be familiar with all the issues involved, but he was not ready to  commit himself entirely to the view just expressed bySir Albert Stanley.  He was not prepared  to  say that he was yielding  to pressure  inthis case.   He was not certain that they  were really fighting a bad principle.    SIR JOSEPH MACLAY was inclined to think  that the principle for which themen were contending was a right one.  In any case he was not prepared to go so faras Sir Albert Stanley.

Notes of a Conference held at the Board of Trade on Monday, 3rd February, 1919,                                  at 5 P.M.                     Present:The Right Hon. SIR A. STANLEY, M.P. (in the Chair).                          MR. G. J. WARDLE, M.P., Parliamentary                            Secretary, Ministry of Labour.                          SIR  D. J. SHACKLETON, K.C.B., Permanent                            Secretary, Ministry of Labour.                          SIR  H. WALKER, K.C.B., Chairman, Rail-                            way Executive Committee.                          SIR  A. K. BUTTERWORTH, Railway Execu-                            tive Committee.                          SIR  W.  F.  MARWOOD,  K.C.B.,  Board  of                            Trade.                          MR.  E.  G.  MOGGRIDGE,  C.B.,  Board  of                            Trade.                          MR. E. R. EDDISON, Board of Trade.MR. THOMAS JONES,  War Cabinet (Acting Secretary).CAPTAIN L. F. BURGIS,  War Cabinet (Assistant Secretary).    SIR ALBERT  STANLEY  read  the  following communication which he  hadreceived from the Railway Executive Committee :     &quot;The Railway Executive  Committee, as the  body responsible for the working of         the railways,  desire to put it on record that it will be entirely subversive of         discipline to allow the Railway Clerks&apos; Association to represent the station-         masters and supervisory grades.    &quot; They further point out that the  claims of the Clerks&apos; Association go beyond the         claims conceded to or made by any other union.    &quot; That they raise  no objection to the  stationmasters and other sections of the         supervising staff forming associations of their own,  but that in their view it         is open to the gravest objection that the supervising staff should be members         of the same association as the supervised.&quot;    SIR ALBERT STANLEY said that yesterday afternoon, after consultation. with sir Herbert Walker and Sir Alfred Butterworth,  he had asked Mr.  Wardle, knowingthat he was on friendly terms with the general secretary and assistant secretary of  theRailway Clerks&apos; Association, to see  them privately, and find out whether it was possibleto effect any compromise with the association.  No instructions were given to Mr.The  Right Hon.  the  YISCOUNT  MILNER,  G.C.B., G.C.M.G.,  Secretary  of State  for the Colonies.The  Right Hon. E. SHORTT, M.P., Secre-  tary of State for Home Affairs.The Right Hon. SIR R. S. HOENE, K.B.E.,  K.C., M.P.,  Minister of Labour.The  Right Hon.  SIR J. MACL^Y,  M.P.,  Shipping Controller.The  Right  Hon.  A.  H.  ILLINGWOJRTH,  M.P., Postmaster-General.ME. W.  C. BEIDGEMAN, M.P.,  Parliamen-  tary Secretary, Board of Trade.
Wardle, but he was to endeavour to obtain clearly the association^ views, after whichhe could give his opinion as to whether a compromise was possible or not.    MR. WARDLE  said that he saw Mr. Walkden last night after he, Mr. Walkden,had  been to the conference  at Birmingham, and  to the mass meeting at the EustohTheatre.   Mr. Lathan, the assistant secretary, was also present.    On the general question, of the recognition of the union, including the station-lTrislirs and  the  supervisory grades, they were  adamant,  and no compromise waspossible.  Regarding an arrangement within those lines, he thought that it might bepossible to come to an understanding, provided that general recognition was agreed to.    Mr.  Wardle  said that  for some time this union had  had separate  branches forstationmasters and agents which were quite distinct from the clerks, and  there was nointermixing.  These  grades had had separate  meetings and they were quite willing togive an undertaking to continue this in the future.   They had no desire for compulsorymembership, though  it would be difficult for them to pledge their successors for thefuture ; neither did they object to other associations, provided that these associationsreceived no preferential treatment.    Mr.  Wardle  added that he  found Mr. Walkden quite reasonable if the claimsregarding the stationmasters and the supervisory grades  were conceded.    In reply to a question  by Sir Robert Home as to whether agreement would  belimited to stationmasters and goods agenis alone without bringing in other supervisorygrades,  Mr.  Wardle  replied  that it would not be  easy  in practice to make  suchdifferentiation.    LORD MILNER asked what objection there could  be to all being members of oneunion so long.as they did not meet  on  the  same footing.   Officers and  soldiers were members  of one  army,  and  had  certain common interests.   What  seemed to himobjectionable was the possibility of the supervisory grades  being hauled over the coalsby their  subordinates.  If this were excluded he did not see  that the difficulties were very formidable.    SIR HERBERT WALKER said that he would like to answer Lord Milner&apos;s pointregarding officers and men belonging to one army.  There was this to  be  rememberedthat the men could not call  out the officers on  strike, whereas  the clerks would be ableto do this.                         i.    MR. WARDLE  said that this was the first time that there  had been  a hint of astrike in this union.  They did not want a  strike,  and it  was not their  policy.  he doubted  whether clerks  calling out  stationmasters  on strike  would really  arise  inpractice.  It might be possible to  come to an agreement that the stationmasters shouldhave the right to decide by themselves whether they should strike or not.    SIR HERBERT WALKER  asked  if it  would be possible to form a separateexecutive for  stationmasters and another  for  clerks.   They might be allowed toco-ordinate and join  benefit funds, but when a question of discipline arose, they xvouldact separately.    SIR ALBERT  STANLEY suggested  that no definite understanding should&apos; be arrived at at the present moment,  except a statement for the consideration for the WarCabinet, but that he  should take the matter in hand  with the Railway Executive and see whether a compromise was possible.    LORD  MILNER  said it was clearly not a  case for proceeding  to extremes,otherwise, it might develop into a fight of a grave character on  an unsatisfactory issue.               *    SIR ALBERT  STANLEY said that just before the meeting, Sir  Herbert Walkerhad informed him that, in the event of no recognition being given to this union, thewhole of the railwaymen would probably come out in sympathy.    SIR HERBERT WALKER  said that resolutions had been received  to this effect from  some of the wages  grades, and stating that if the clerks&apos; association came out,the goods traffic men  would not  handle  goods not booked  by the  regular railwayclerks.[1048]D
    SIR A. BUTTERWORTH asked if it was still too late to bring the Governmentto treat the whole question as a national problem.   If labour was organised  so  thatthe supervisory and lower grades were in  the same union, intimidation of the formerwould inevitably result.   It was hardly fair to treat it as if it were a railway questionalone.    SIR ROBERT HORNE said that he had taken steps to ascertain the position regarding other industries.   With regard to the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, theemployers always refused to allow the union  to  speak  for  the  foremen, although theforemen were allowed to remain in the union.   This big and powerful union had not succeeded in imposing the conditions which the  Clerks&apos; Association was  novr peekingto enforce.  This also applied to the shipbuilding federation and shipbuilding trades,and, as far as he could gather, most of  the trades in this country were in the  same position.  In the cotton  trade, however,  where the foremen and the men  had separateunions, a foreman could belong to  both  unions if he so desired.  If the  Governmentwent  the whole length of acceding to the demands of the Railway Clerks&apos; Associations,the employers in other trades would not  be able to resist similar  demands.    In reply to a question, Sir Herbert Walker said that as they had never recognisedthis union, they could not forbid the stationmasters to join it.    Sir Robert Horne, continuing,  said that he was now clear that we could not  givea non-possumus answer.   A way had got to be found round  the difficulty, and hethought Mr.  Wardle&apos;s.  suggestions offered  the  best  opening,  i.e,, if  the railway executive would  offer no objection to the union and would permit anyone to join it,but on the  understanding  that  stationmasters  and supervisory grades could not be permitted to put forward their claims through the Union Executive.  These claims would  have to be  submitted by persons selected  by  the  stationmasters themselves.They  could, however, if they liked, choose  the general secretary of the union torepresent them, but the  other members of the delegation  would have to be  station-masters.  He was averse to fighting the  question on the  issue of the recognition of the supervisory grades.     MR. WARDLE said that he thought an agreement might be arrived at on  theselines, i.e., agreement to  a separate section  of stationmasters and supervisory grades inthe  union  with practical  autonomy, with,  however, this proviso, that  the  general secretary of the union should be their spokesman if it was so desired, and that  theyshould continue to participate in the general benefits and take  part in the affairs ofthe union.   With  regard to this being laid down in  the rules  he thought  that anundertaking to this effect would be  better  than an attempt at a  rigid enforcement byrules.     SIR A. BUTTERWORTH said that he thought it  should also be laid down that membership of the union must not be compulsory.    MR. WARDLE replied  that this might be possible for the present, but he didnot think that an undertaking could be given as to the future.  The  association hadno intention at the  moment of making membership compulsory.     LORD MILNER said that it  would be impossible for the association to give  a pledge as  to  the  future.   In his  opinion all would join  the union sooner or  later.There should, however,  be  no embargo on anyone wishing to join the.union.     SIR HERBERT WALKER said  that he would like  to put in a caveat against this.   It would be an  impossible  position if  certain  confidential clerks,  who  were.dealing with such vital  matters as the  relations between, the companies and the&apos;men, were allowed to join.     MR. WARDLE said  that  raised the question .as to what was  and was not  a confidential clerk.   This matter had come up in  debate in the House of Commons in 1909, and  great difficulty  had been found in drawing a  line.  He gathered, however, from Mr. Walkden that the association  would not object to a limited office, such as the general managers  office, not joining the  union.  In  1909 an  agreement had  been come  to with the Great Eastern Railway  whereby  the general manager decided who  was and  who  was not a  confidential clerk.   Mr.  Wardle did not  think the association would accept that  solution now, but in cases of  difficulty regarding definition an appeal might lie to the Minister of Labour.
    SIR HERBERT WALKER said that it would be impossible to limit the exclusionto the general managers office.  On some systems the superintendent of the line andthe chief engineer had  about -20,000 men under them, and exclusion  would have tobe given to the staffs of such important officials.    MR.  WARDLE said that  Mr. Walkden  had agreed that the union should not include the chief officials&apos; personal clerks, and private secretaries.   (Appendix.)    LORD MILNER  thought  a  further  discussion  should  take  place  with theassociation, as he thought there was a good deal of room for give and take.    SIR  JOSEPH M ACL AY thought  that Mr.  Wardle&apos;s  statement   regarding his conversation with Mr.  Walkden was clear, definite,  and reasonable, and he saw great danger in endeavouring to make the conditions too rigid.    SIR  HERBERT WALKER pointed out  that he hoped the Conference realised that the  Railway Executive was  still of the  opinion  that these concessions would gravely interfere with the discipline of  the railway.    SIR  ALBERT  STANLEY asked  how the  Ministry of Labour proposed to dealwith other employers if a similar position arose.  Sir Robert Home replied that theirsituation was quite different, and each case would have to be gone into and considered on its merits.    SIR  HERBERT  WALKER thought that within a week a similar demand wouldbe received from the National Union of Railwaymen.    SIR A,  BUTTERWORTH  asked if  the  Government could not say  that animportant question  of principle was involved, and  that  they proposed to appoint  acommittee  of enquiry.   They  would never have a  better  chance of  taking up thegeneral, question and settling it on legislative lines.   , SIR ROBERT HORNE pointed out that if  this course was taken  they would bemet with a volume of similar demands from other industries,   The boiler-makerswere already nibbling  at the  question,  and the miners were trying to  be allowed torepresent the deputies in their union.     SIR HERBERT  WALKER said  that there were a good many traffic foremen inthe National Union, of Railwaymen, and  that  union had  never claimed to representthem.   They would, however, certainly do so if the  demand of the railway clerks was conceded.     SIR ROBERT HORNE pointed out that there was a federation of foremen in theengineering trade, but that they were in  a separate union, and employers contributed to their benefit fund.    SIR JOSEPH  MACLAY did not think that  the inclusion of  foremen in the sameunion as  the men would lessen the loyalty of the former to their employers.     LORD MILNER said that&apos; it was most important to secure that the conduct of thecontroller should not be challenged by the controlled.  He did not see that the inclusionof both in the one union necessarily involved  that.  Nor was there an,y great objectionto all the members uniting in support of  their common interest very much as all ranks in the army agreed  to support improvements in pay and pensions.     SIR  HERBERT  WALKER  said that  occasionally men reported  about theirforemen to the general secretary of the union on questions of discipline, and the union officials consequently interfered in complaints affecting different grades.     MR.  WARDLE thought that  an undertaking should  be obtained from the Clerks&apos;Association which would provide that any question of discipline arising from the actionof stationmasters and  agents was  not to be settled  by the clerks&apos; section, but by thestationmasters and agents themselves.  In the case of  a  grave injustice, there was noobjection to the  case being referred to  the  grievance-hearer.  At present the union officials would pass on such a case to the grievance-hearer.     SIR  ALBERT STANLEY  jsaid  that before  re-opening negotiations  with theassociation he would  like the express  decision  of the Cabinet  on  the fundamental question at issue.   From his point of view, and looking to the great industries  of the country as a whole he was of opinion that a decision in favour of complete recognition would be received by  the employers of the country with profound amazement.  Such a
far-reaching decision could only be given by the War Cabinet, and it would have to be-frankly extended to the other railway unions and presently to  industry generally.  he did not admit that the device of sections made any serious difference.  Experience of therailway unions in the  past had shown that  a  concession granted to  one  would immediately be followed by fresh and larger demands from another.    SIR JOSEPH MACLAY said that he was not arguing for recognition as a  matterof convenience but as a right principle, and he would not be sorry to see the claim nowurged  by the men acknowledged right through the industry of the country.  He was sure it had  to come, and he thought  the proposals  outlined by Mr.  Wardle veryreasonable.    LORD MILNER did  not  agree  with the chairman that any general and all-embracing statement of policy by the War Cabinet was  necessary.  It  was  enough todeal with the case  in review and  he thought negotiations might be re-opened with theClerks&apos; Association without reference, at this stage, to the War Cabinet.    SIR  ALBERT  STANLEY  replied that  the  next  step was the cruicial step,namely, the  demand that the  supervisory staff shall be  free to belong to the sameunion  as  the  supervised.   If the  War Cabinet conceded  that, then,  he agreed, asettlement could only be reached along the lines suggested by Mr. Wardle.    MR. WARDLE referred to the urgency of  the matter.  If no definite reply were received  by the Union by  6  P.M.  on  Tuesday a strike would follow.  On the otherhand, if negotiations were re-opened by 6 P.M. it must be on the understanding thatthe Government was genuinely  trying to reach an amicable arrangement.    SIR ALBERT STANLEY suggested that the conference should adjourn in orderthat Lord Milner, Sir Robert Horne, and himself should confer with Mr. Bonar Law.    LORD  MILNER  said he would  propose to Mr. Bonar Law  that negotiations should be re-opened with the union on the following day, and that an attempt should bemade to compromise on the basis  of sectionalising the  union, the exclusion of  certain limited confidential and managerial ranks, and an undertaking that there should be no effort to compel men to join the Clerks&apos; Association.    It was agreed to accept the chairman&apos;s proposal, and the Conference adjourned.    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,          February 3, 1919.APPENDIX.            Notes of a Private&apos; Conversation with the  General  Secretary                       of the  Railway Clerks&apos;  Association:    THE Railway Clerks&apos; Association s request for recognition applies to :-    (o.)  All clerks employed in the service of the railways.    (b.) All stationmasters, agents, and supervisors generally.   . It does not include chief officials and their private secretaries.    The clerks are organised in separate branches distinct from  stationmasters, agents and supervisors,  and have neither the right nor  the opportunity  to question theconduct  of  the latter with reference to matters  in  which disciplinary action isnecessary.    Stationmasters,  agents and  supervisors at present hold  separate conferences,organise separate deputations, and are willing that negotiations shall be conductedseparately on their behalf with the assistance of the union officials.    There is no movement for  compulsory membership and the officials do not desireit.                            *&quot;      - &quot;  &apos;                     .       v.    The Railway Clerks&apos; Association  does not object to legitimate competition withother associations,  but does object  to   preferential treatment in  their  case.  Itclaims the right to speak for its own members.o
