I desire to direct the attention of the War Cabinet to the   advisability of- sanctioning the release of an increased quantity   of Spirits from Bond.2.       The amount at present allowed to be released is 50-^ of the   quantity released from Bond in 1916.5.       I am reluctantly foroed to the conclusion:that the difficulty   of obtaining Spirits by those who have been accustomed to drink   them aggravates to an appreoiable extent \m the unrest so painfully  &apos; apparent in shipping ports and industrial centres.  And there is -: a considerable consensus of opinion on the part of recognised   Trades Union leaders that a. relaxation of the present stringency   would have an ameliorating effect.4.       Complaints are, moreover, frequent on the part of invalids  : and aged persons that they are unable to &quot;obtain spirits notwithstand   ing that they are advised,to take,them by medical men.  This   trouble has been intensified by the prevalence of influenza.. The   shortage of spirits is undoubtedly responsible for an extension of   the drug habit..5.,       I do not believe that any appreciable increase of drunkenness \ would result from increased supplies of Spirits,  and I am -   clear  . that the policy which I venture to reoommend would lessen the   existing prejudice against the Government as needlessly depriving   the people of the comforts of life.6.       I suggest, therefore, that the present amount of spirits .   allowed to be released1 should be, increased by 50$f; in which case .  the amount available would be 75$. of that-- In 1916..7. &apos;      I make this recommendation because I feel that we cannot - any longer continue simply,to restrict the issue of spirits -  with a view to enforcing temperance..  I  recognise,, however,  that   the mere gradual return to pre-war conditions in respect of the   trade in intoxicating liquors,, would be most unfortunate.  I urge  .. that some, definite policy of dealing with- this question ought to   be adopted by the Government at the earliest possible moment.   The first step to this is to make it the duty of some one depart-   men-t or other \ov of a Cabinet Committee) to prepare a scheme for   the permanent settlement:of the question, whether on the lines of   nationalisation, disinterested management,, control of qualities   and prices, or otherwise.G.II. ROBERTS.Ministry of Food,    7th February 1919.
