MINISTRY 0? SHIPFIiiG.     -^ffi&amp;te-Otct&apos;Jm*E6747TV hSS^   I ^  STORAGE OP FOODSTUFFS .    MIL            The Shipping Controller desired to draw the attention       of  the War Cabinet  to the very serious difficulties which       may arise in consequence of the present distribution of       our food supplies.     Under normal circumstances, the       Country&apos;s stocks are widely distributed in the housewife&apos;s       cupboard,, in retail shops and in larger establishments at       inland centres  of population throughout the country. During       the war, the central control of supplies has involved       the storage of  a large proportion of the Country&apos;s stocks       in  bulk at or near  the ports, and this is still the       position.   It  will inevitably hamper, if not  stop, the              t       flow  of exports from and imports into the Country.  Further,       and at  the present  moment,  this consideration  is of paramount       importance -  in the event  of  a railway-strike  or other  labour -       trouble,  the  Country would be in  imminent peril  of starvation.      - The,Shipping  Controller  urges,  therefore, that whatever steps       are necessary,  be I      Immediately taken to  force       distribution  as under  pre-war conditions, including  the       removal of the  Order  prohibiting  all restrictions  on what        is  termed &quot;hoarding&quot;.4th February 1919.
