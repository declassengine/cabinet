W.C[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.[January 28, 1919.]G.T, 6-fif.POLITICAL  INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,           FOREIGN OFPICE.GERMANY /032.       MEMORANDUM              ONTHE  GERMAN  ELECTIONS.    I. THE result of the elections for the German National Assembly is now officiallyknown.   It is as follows : Majority SocialistsChristian Peopled PartyGerman Democratic  Party  ...German National People&apos;s  Party (Conservatives)German Peopled Party (National Liberals)Independent SocialistsVarious other Parties165 91 75 38 22 22TOTAL421     Twelve deputies would have been elected by Alsace-Lorraine, bringing the total upto 433, but in view of the fact  that Alsace-Lorraine is  being administered  as  if itwere French territory it has indeed been officially declared to be French by PresidentPoincare-elections there were impracticable.     At first it was not  known how far it had been possible to hold the elections inother  German territory  on the  left  bank  of the  Rhine.   The French  have beenadministering the Saar Valley  as  if it were part of  Lorraine, a proceeding which hasbeen made  the  subject  of  a vigorous  protest.   It  was  therefore  supposed that noelections could have  taken place there.  The German wireless  of the 25th Januaryproves that, as a matter of fact, the inhabitants of that region must have participated.The wireless shows that on the day previous to the elections, leaflets were  distributedat Saarlouis- &quot;by the worst elements of the civil population, and also to some extent, bymembers of the French garrison,&quot;  to the following effect:          &quot; Citizens of Saarlouis !   Throw off the Prussian yoke which you  have borne     for a century !  Remain brethren  of the Lorrainers !   Join yourselves to France,     who will guarantee your vital interests !   Show  this to-morrow at the election by     withholding your votes or by handing in a blank voting paper! &quot;     The wireless adds that the political parties (ie., the German parties) in the townimmediately published a  counter-appeal.   &quot; Only a very few  Germans took part in thispiece of treachery (ie., abstinence from voting).  The great majority  of  the peopleproved to be inaccessible to such machinations.&quot;     Then there is the  case of  Posen and  the  portions  of  East and West Prussiainhabited or claimed by the Poles. It was expected that in many of  these  districtsthere would be insurmountable difficulties, but no accounts of what actually took placehave been received.     The local polling  statistics  telegraphed (to Reuter) from  The  Hague  on the21st January are obviously inaccurate.  The Berlin  figures are quite different in the totals given by Reuter and in  the votes which he reports to have been registered forthe candidates of the different parties.   Even  in pre-war  times  it always  took  sometime to arrive at  exact  figures.   Under the proportional  system with  party lists,however, the totals  are so large that a wide margin  allowed  for error does not affectthe actual result.     2. It is assumed that the result of the elections will  be reflected in a coalition government, as the strongest party, the  Majority Socialists, falls short by forty-six ofan absolute majority of the Assembly.   The  most natural  coalition would be with thebourgeois Democrats, which would give a working majority of fifty-nine over  all theother parties.  But it is probable that many of  the  Catholic  Centre Deputies  would support the present Government or one formed on  the same lines.   Catholic voters inthe  Rhenish and Westphalian  industrial districts  are  politically advanced  in theirviews.   Erzberger, who has been elected, will certainly support a Socialist-Democrat      [752]-101
 or even a pure Majority Socialist Government.   Indeed, he  or  someone of his political colour may well be asked to take office, seeing that the (mainly Catholic) new Christian People&apos;s part)7 comes next after  the Majority Socialists in  strength.   It may fairly be expected  that  a  Government of  Socialists and  bourgeois Democrats, or, alternatively, a Government composed of Majority Socialists, Democrats, and representatives of the Christian Peopled party (Catholic Centre), will have an overwhelming majority in the Assembly, at any rate at the outset.     3.  Yet all these calculations are subject to&quot; the possibility of disturbance by factors which are at present obscure.   Bolshevism and Spartacism  are, in  one  aspect, the crude and lawless  expression of  facts which  often militate against the success of representative government on the broadest basis.   The economic interests, like the moral forces of a nation, are  not invariably expressed by  the results of an election, even if these  results be the outcome of a system based upon something approaching mathematically exact representation.   When  the  German National  Assembly was elected on the 19th January, the  dominating  feelings of great masses of the electorate were undoubtedly  horror  at  the excesses of  the Spartacists, and a desire to erect a barrier against the  inroads of  that kind of anarchy.  The aversion  excited by the deeds of the Spartacists extended not only to the Independent Socialists, who had had some truck with them, but also, so far as some of the genuinely revolutionary bourgeois electors were concerned, to the  Majority  Socialists as well.   Many of the bourgeois, in accepting and furthering  the revolution, had  been prepared to support an  Ebert Government, as they believed in Ebert&apos;s essential moderation and firmness.   They were disappointed  when  they  found  that  Ebert and  his associates  had been too hesitating in the measures which they at first adopted for the repression of Spartacist excesses.   The &quot; Vorwarts &quot; (22nd January) says :         -  &quot; Two months ago Social Democracy would have been assured of a tremendous     majority, but now through the fault of the Independents in associating themselves     to some extent with the Spartacists it is no longer sure.&quot;     It is  indeed quite possible that if the Berlin street fighting of the first and second weeks of  January had not  taken place, the two  sections of the Socialists  would together have secured an absolute majority in the National Assembly.     4.  The mainly Catholic  Centre,  it ought  to be  noted, has for  the first  time managed  to, secure  a considerable amount of  non-Catholic support.  This is true  not only of the elections for the German National Assembly, but also of some of the State Elections in Bavaria, for  example.  The Centre invited  support from all who laid stress on  the maintenance of the Christian character of the State, whether they were Protestants or Catholics.  The   Secularist edicts  of  the  late Prussian Minister  of Public  Worship and Education, Adolf Hoffmann, who acted  without consulting his colleagues in the Socialist Prussian Ministry, had  the effect of uniting the advocates of the  continued recognition of Christianity.   (The edicts separating Church and State, and abolishing religious  instruction and  clerical  inspection even of  Catholic schools, have now  been withdrawn.)   Meetings  convened  by the Centre in Berlin, including a great mass meeting in front of the Castle, are said to have been attended by 60,000 people in  one day.   Catholic priests  and Protestant pastors  spoke and repelled the attacks  of  sections  of  the press which represented  them as  sacrificing their religious convictions for the purpose  of  political combination,   One of them declared:  &quot;We  need  a  united front against  an impudent,  unmeasured,  insane heathendom.&quot;  The manifesto of the Centre said :          &quot;Membership  of  the   Centre Party as  a  Christian  People&apos;s Party is  not     restricted  by religious creed.  xA.ll citizens whose.religion is Christian have this     common basis for political work.&quot; And  the  manifesto went  on to lay   down a  comprehensive, if  somewhat  vague,programme of social reform.*   In the  economic  sphere  the attitude of the newparty  is  thus summed  up  by  the  Protestant  Professor  of  Theology, Dunkmann :&quot; A Christian  Peoples Party is as averse from extreme Socialism as from unscrupulousprivate enterpise.&quot;     It is  probable  that the reformed   Centre Party will  play at  least as important a part  as the old Centre  played in the political life of Germany.  Any conceivable German Government a Minority Socialist or Sparticist Government is not at present   *  See for a full  account  of the whole subject an article by  Professor Martin Fassbeuder in theil Deulsche Allgemeine Zeitung,&quot; Morning Edition, January 15, 1919 (Supplement).
 conceivable is bound to  recognise  the advantages which may  be secured by not breaking with the Vatican or with millions of Catholics throughout the world, especially in America.   German politicians, even when they are themselves secularists, are more careful not to  estrange such influences than the French were  during  their period  of Socialist-Radical legislation.   And the French themselves have,  in recent  years, revised their attitude towards Catholic influences, regarded from the political point of view.     5.  Official opinion in Berlin  seems to be crystallising in favour of Weimar as the meeting-place of the German National Assembly.   Indeed, there have been repeated- announcements that  it will meet  there,  but their authority is doubtful.    There has even been  talk of taking the future Prussian Assembly to Weimar a step which would probably excite great opposition.   The  Central  Council of Workmen  and Soldiers is against it.   They consider that the removal  of  the  Assembly from Berlin  would necessarily involve the removal of the Government, and that, as it is not proposed  to attempt the transfer of the great Government Departments, the administration, would fall  into confusion.  The revolutionaries of the Kingdom of Saxony want the Assembly to meet in  Dresden, although Dresden and  Leipzig have, like Berlin, been the scene of Spartacist  disturbances.   The Saxons pointed out that the accommodation available at Weimar would  be inadequate.  Members would have difficulty in finding lodgings. The meeting-place would have been the famous  Weimar Theatre, associated with the names  of  Goethe  and Schiller.  That  building is unsuitable for  the meeting ol a Parliamentary  Assembly.  It is, further, likely  enough that in a place like Weimar the debates might tend to become diffuse or academic.  In Berlin public opinion might at times seek violent expression, but it would keep the attention of the Assembly centred on particular questions.&apos; There are doubtless difficulties in Berlin.  It is asserted that the Spartacus  movement has been quelled.  Most of the  Independent Socialists appear to be shaking themselves clear of it and are showing some signs of seeking reunion with the Majority Socialists.  But the industrial situation is very uncertain, if not menacing. Once and  again the urban means of communication,  the  metropolitan railway and omnibus services,  have been interrupted  by strikes.  The engineers and guards on the Underground have been demanding wages on a Bolshevist scale 201. or 30Z. a month. A few evenings ago Berlin  was plunged into darkness by a strike at the electric works. The labouring  population, is  being disarmed, but a few resolute  extremists  could paralyse the activities of the Assembly by cutting railway and telegraph and telephone communications, as has repeatedly been done for  periods of hours or whole  days in the course of the recent troubles.     The old Reichstag building, it appears, is not available for the National Assembly. It is occupied by the  Central Council of Workmen and  Soldiers, and by the revolutionary committees.  The former meeting-place  of the  Prussian Chamber has been suggested, but  that will presumably be wanted for  the Prussian National Assembly which was to have been elected on the  26th.  It was announced that the National Assembly would be convened for  the 6th  February, so that the final decision as to the meeting-place cannot  long be postponed.     P.S. Meeting-place of  the  National Assembly. The German  wireless  of  the 27th January  (serial No.  S004), states that convocation  of the Constituent National Assembly  for  the &quot;6th January&quot;  [sic] evidently  a mistake for the 6th February- at Weimar,  is  now  made known  in the  &quot; Reichsanzeiger,&quot;  by a  Decree  dated  the 21st January,  signed by  People&apos;s Commissaries,  Ebert  and  Scheidemann, and  by secretary of State for the Interior, Dr. Preuss.
