Sfomorandupi by the President of the Local Government Board.          Section 5 of the Municipal Corrupt and IllegalPractices Act, 1884, which is applicable to all looalelections provides that a candidate&apos;e expenses shall, subjectto certain exceptions, not exceed the sum of  25 and if thenumber of electors in the electoral division exceeds 500 anadditional sum of 3d. for each elector above the first 500.          The Representation of the People Act has reduced the amount of candidates1 expenses at parliamentary elections and when the Bill ims in the House the question was raised whether in view of the anticipated large increase in thelocal government electorate the foregoing ocale should alsobe reduced.  No action was taken then and the matter was leftover.          The London Oounty Council and the County councils association have now urged that the sum of 3d, should bereduced to 2d.          Taking London as an example 1 find that in the-electoral divisions as formerly constituted the average numberof electors was 14,252.  Under the new register the average number of electors in an electoral division is 26,426.  Underthe existing law with the limit of 3d per 500 electors, theaverage maximum of a candidate^ expenses was  197.  But with fthe increase of the electorate the average  woul&apos;d&quot; &quot;be    1.7&quot;^* 349.  If 2d were substituted for 3d the latter sum woul3 bereduced to  241, and if the limit were reduced to Id the figure would be  133.          The only suggestion made to me is a reduction of 3d.to 2d, and this seems a reasonable proposal,  I do not antioi-pate any opposition.  I therefore propose, if my colleagues agree, to bring in the accompanying Bill and pass it at theearliest possible moment, substituting 2d for 3.d^in the scale.If it is to affect the County Council Election ^present year it must be passed before the end of February.  But for thisreason I would have proposed to include a clause to the aboveeffect in the other Bill which I am hoping to introduce dealingwith the election of local authorities in the present year.
