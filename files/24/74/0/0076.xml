(Memorandum, by  the DeputymChairman of  the  Committee..)     For  the purpose of  the  ordinary  qaparation allowance  of12/6d a week, the  unmarried  wives  of  soldiers ore treated  inexaotly the same way as  married wives.   The question  has now arisen as to. the position of tue  unmarried wife as regardsthe supplementary  separation allowance  of 6/6d granted  tochildless wives who are  not  earning wages.     It appears that any married  wife who fulfils the pre&quot;bribed conditioners panted the  whole  of th-&apos; supplementaryallowance on application: dependents, however,  are onlygranted part or all of this  allow nee at the  discretion ofLoc-il Committees,  As no specific  ruling has  &quot;been made  asto whether the unmarried wife  is  to he  considered as wife  ordependent, the treatment meted out to these women is notuniform throughout the country,     The Committee have  considered this  matter, (Soldiers  &amp;Sailors Pay Committee 43rd Meeting, Minute 3,  January 9th,1919) and in view  of the fact  that the unmarried  wife is granted the ordinary separation  allow mce  only after  the.  most stringentenquiries have shewn a proved domestic &quot;basis,  they reoommend;-Th&apos;J-t for the purpose of the supplementary  separately -ation allowance referred to abov.; the unmarriedwife shall -be tr*  -tea on exactly the sane  &quot;basisan the marrLeu wife.For the ChairmanFebruary 10th 1919.(Sd)  T.J.  v/;aciiai.^ra.
