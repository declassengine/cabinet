MMTHIS &quot;ToCUl/ENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ UOVSrTRT/XKT.N.S.R.  54,RETAIL BUSINESS LICENSING ORDER 1018.-     jviQmorandum by the Minister of National Service.     I desire to call the attention of the War.Cabinet  to  thequestion of the future administration of the  Retail BusinessLicensing Order made under Defence of the Realm Regulation BAA.The Order provides that no person shall, without a licence issuedby or under the authority of the Director-General of NationalService, establish or carry on any new retail trade or  business or any new branch of any existing retail trade or business.   its main practical object is the protection of the interests  of menwho before joining His Majesty1 s Forces were  carrying on  retailtrades or businesses.   It is abundantly olear that this  order has been of the greatest possible value in preventing unfair  corn-pot it Ion, in which the alien element has been particularly con-spicuous.   That this protection should be continued at leastduring the period of demobilisation is obviously essential andis constantly being impressed upon me by unanimous resolutionsfrum Chambers of Commerce and Trade, Borough Councils,  The-National Federation of Demobilised Sailors &amp;  Soldiers,  One HanBusiness Associations, Comrades of the Great  War, and other similar bodies.     Hitherto the Order has been administered - by the headquarters and Regional Staffs of the Ministry of National Service with theassistance of the police and various bodies of the kind above mentioned.   In view however, of the cessation of the main func-tions of this Ministry and the consequent disbandment of itsofficials, it appears to me that tho administration, of the aboveOrder ought new to be transferred to some more permanent  Depart-ment of State, as otherwise it would be necessary to retain avery considerable staff at great expense for the purpose  of dis-cbarging duties which could be as advantageously and &quot;at the sametime more economically performed by tho existing staff and machinery of some other Government Department.   The importance and. extent of the work involved will be apparent from the factthat in the week ending January 11th applications for licencesamounted to 847, and in the week ending January 18th to about1,000.   I am confident that with some introductory assistance which can readily be made available, from officials of this ministry.who have experience In administering the Order,  a Depart.ment with competent local organisations, 3uch as the Advisory&apos;Committees to the Employment Exchanges under the Ministry ofLabour, could both effectively and economically undertake thowork,31.1.19.A.
