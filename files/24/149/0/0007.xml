SECRET.    APPRECIATION  OF THE  ATTACHFD  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                               REPORT  No.  82.PART II.- FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.                          TRACK DISCUSSIONS (page 16).    (1) Undoubtedly the most important political event of the week lias been the meetingof the  Emperors  of Germany  and Austria at  German Imperial. Headquarters.  TheGerman Press has been showing some resentment  over the small amount of informa-tion which lias been made public.  The only question of  which anything is known isthat of Poland (page  17). Latest information is that Germany proposed that ArchdukeKarl Stephen, should become King, attached  to Germany by  political and economicalliance.   To this Austria has not agreed, but she has decided to accept any decision which  the Polish Regency and State Council, may reach.    In view of the  critical situation in Bulgaria, Germany agreed not to claim, anyAustrian territory &quot;for herself, but dec-lined to guarantee territorial  integrity.    (2) No further information has come to hand with regard to the Conference betweenthe Bolshevist and Finnish  representatives at Berlin.   (See Reports Nos. 80 and 81.)    (3) The Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign  Office has communicateda Memorandum (page 18) dealing with M. Troelstra&apos;s recent activities in Switzerland.Apart  from  the  question  of  iVI.  Troelstra&apos;s   good faith  in all  his  dealings, theMemorandum would tend to show that private communications,  reported second orthird hand, must usually prove to be an unsatisfactory  means of reaching a solutionof difficult problems.     A. letter from Mr. A.  Henderson  on the same  subject  appeared  in  the British-Press  on the 22nd instant.                                GENERAL (page 2).     (I)  Negotiations for the exchange of prisoners with  Austria and  Turkey are  in.progress.     (2)  Great difficulty is experienced  in sending remittances to British subjects  interritory occupied by Germany.                                ALLTED COUNTRIES.     China (page 3). Germany appears  to be annoyed by  China&apos;s refusal to acceptthe Papal Nuncio (Report No. 81, page 2).  This action  is attributed to French and Japanese influence.     Japan (page 5). -Rice riots have  broken out in  the principal  towns.  As the shortage -was partly due to an attempt to form a corner  the Government is arranging to take over the supply.                                                   [P.T.O.

PART  II.-FOREIGN  AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.    Sinkings. According  to the War Trade Intelligence  Bureau,  the total tonnageof .500 tons gross in the case  of  steamers, and 100 tons gross in the  case of sailing-ships, reported  lost owing  to the malice of the King&apos;s  enemies during the periodAugust 9th 15th inclusive,  was 75,016  tons gross,  of which  40,20.8 were British,as compared with 63,312 tons gross, of which 33,527 were British, reported last week.    A table.drawn up by the Admiralty shows that the daily average, both of world.tonnage and of  British  tonnage, sunk by enemy action during July is the lowest yetrecorded since the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare.   - Issue of Safe-Conducts  by  Germany to Neutral Vessels. The Allies are now considering their attitude towards the German system of safe-conducts.  With regardto the various neutrals the situation is as follows: -    (1) Netherlands. The Germans are  prepared to  allow Dutch vessels to proceed           overseas  from  the Netherlands  to  fetch  supplies  on  condition that a          guarantee is given that a corresponding number of vessels wdll be released          from American  waters to proceed to Holland.    (2) Denmark. The Danish Government have officially recognised the  S37stem of           safe-conducts.  Full  lists  have been submitted by the Danish Chartering           Committee to the German  authorities  of the Danish vessels  trading with           Iceland, Greenland, Spain,  the Faroe Islands, Flolland and the Baltic, and          have guaranteed that these ships wdll observe all the prescribed conditions.          Vessels carrying agricultural produce  to the United  Kingdom are covered          by the safe-conduct  up to the limit of the danger zone; they are  also           allowed to proceed to Bergen.  &quot; Belative security &quot; has  been promised to          vessels in the Anglo-Danish coal trade.  The Danish Chartering Committee          - have furnished the Germans wdth a list of the vessels  engaged in this          trade, and have given undertakings that  they wdll not engage in inter-          mediate voyages and  that  they will proceed  to the United Kingdom  in          ballast, returning only with coal.    (3) Sweden. The  Germans  are stipulating, as a  condition of the  grant of safe-          conducts to  Swedish  vessels carrying  goods to Sweden,  that the Swedish          consignees of such goods  shall  give  a declaration  (a) that neither the          goods nor their  products shall in any form or circumstances be exported          to the enemies of Germany, or be used for the manufacture of war material          for  the  enemies  of  Germany;  (?;) that  a  similar declaration shall  be          obtained from all  secondary  purchasers.  Acceptance by the Swedes of          this latter condition would mean that goods of  Allied origin  could not  be          used in Sweden for the -manufacture of goods  for the Allies, and would          constitute a breach of the Allied-Swedish Agreement.  This is not desired          by the Swedish Government,  but the  Agreement  cannot yet, in view of          these developments, be regarded as safe.   It is probable that no Swedish          steamers  will  sail  if  we insist  on  the  German  safe-conducts being-          abandoned.    (4) Noru-ay. In  this  case,  again, there  will  be a clash between the Allied-          Norwegian Agreement and the German demand that Norwegian vessels          sailing under German  safe-conducts  shall  carry no cargo which  may          benefit the Allies.  A conference was  recently  held in Berlin between the          German and Norwegian authorities on the  matter, but no agreement was          reached.
     Co-ordination of work connected with Prisoners  of War.  A proposal to set upa standing Inter-departmental Committee to consider all prisoners of Avar questions isunder discussion by the War Cabinet.   (See Memoranda G-.T. 5332 and 5390.)     British Proposal  for Exchange of Prisoners with Austria and Turkey. TheForeign Office has proposed through the Netherlands Government  a  scheme for theexchange, head for head, oE  British and  Austrian  and Hungarian civilians in  thedominions  of, or territories occupied by, Austria-Hungary and  Great Britain.   HisMajesty&apos;s  Government  further  offers  to  repatriate  all  remaining  Austrian  andHungarian prisoners who so  desire (excepting a maximum  of 20), if the  Austro-Hungarian Government can induce the Ottoman Government to accept and carry out proposals  now being made to it for an exchange, in  equal numbers, of British and turkish prisoners of Avar  who have been over 18 months in captivity, and for mutualrepatriation of all British and Turkish civilians.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government hopesshortly to be able to make a separate proposal regarding mutual rexDatriation of suchBritish and Austrian or Flungarian prisoners of  war  as  shall have  oeen  in  captivityfor more than 1.8 months.     Remittances to British Subjects in German Occupied Territory. -Sir W.  Townleyreports that correspondence betAveen the Netherlands Legation in Berlin and Britishsubjects  in occupied territory appears to be impossible.   It  Avonlcl seem, from  astatement  of   the  Imperial Chancellor,  that the German refusal  to  make theseremittances is by way of reprisal.   The Foreign Office instructs Sir W. ToAAmley to request the Netherlands  authorities to press the German Government to permit  suchremittances subject to  reciprocity, failing  which His Majesty&apos;s Government will be unable to  continue to allow any remittances to German  subjects in British occupied territory.   The German  Government appears  to be under the misconception thatpermission to  make such remittances  is  already being refused  by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.   Pending a  satisfactory settlement of this  question,  Sir W. Townley  isinstructed to reopiest the Netherlands Legation in Berlin to afford relief out of Britishfunds to British subjects in the Avar zone.ALLIED  GROUP.                                &apos; BELGIUM.     German Propaganda regarding  the  Flemish Question. German  Wireless ofAugust 15th  continues  the  Flemish  propaganda.   Serial  5848 suggests that theBelgian GoA-ernment is endeavouring to discourage the Flemish language, Avhile serial5840 declares that it aims at suppressing the race itself, and quotes M. Meurcy&apos;s organThe Ticentieth Century as advocating this course,   (z^nd  see Reports Nos. 52,  54, 59,65, 70, 72,  74-70.)                                    BRAZIL.     Interallied Competition for Brazilian Aircraft Trade.-- Sir A. Peel reports thatthe Brazilian  Minister of Marine  has already been approached  by a  United StatesCompany for  information as to the  proposed  aerial programme of  the  brazilian government.  A  British  Company is  also anxious to  take  up the matter, and Sir A.Peel submits  that  its encouragement by Flis  Majesty&apos;s  Government seems  most desirable.  Italian  Wireless of  August  18th  reports  that the  Brazilian  NavalDepartment has ordered the  purchase of Italian bombing  hydroplanes.                                    CHINA.     Proposed Four-Power Loan. The Foreign  Office  has expressed, to the United/States Ambassador its appreciation of the decision, of the United States Government
to form an American group, and  has given its  assent in principle to the proposal to constitute  a new Four-Power group  in place of  the existing consortium (see Report-No:  79).   A request has,  however, been made for elucidation  of various points,particularly as to the nature of the proposed loan  and the question  of relinquishmentto China, or to the new Four-Power group of options on  industrial  and railway loansheld by individual members.     Diplomatic  Relations with the Vatican. Sir J. Jordan  reports that the  ChineseGovernment has now decided to refuse to receive as  Nuncio the Papal Delegate in the philippines (see Report  No.  81), having received from  its Minister in Washington.information  as  to  Iris German  propensities.   The example  of Great Britain andcertain other Powers  will be followed, and an  occasional  Mission  attached to  the vatican, no  Nuncio being received at Peking.  German  Wireless  of August  16thquotes  the Dutch  newspaper De Tycl as attributing  this  refusal  to French and japanese influence.  &quot; If this assumption is  correct then  France by her  procedurewill be  giving  proof  how very much her motto of  the  free  self of.  nations, be  theygreat or small, deserves  to be branded as  false,  as  France is hindering the Govern-ment in Peking from giving attention to the spiritual interests of  a  large  portion ofthe Chinese population who themselves wish to have a representative of this spiritualkind.&quot;     Tibet.--Sir  J. Jordan reports that the Chinese Premier on  August 7th intimated that the restoration of order in Szechuen  must  necessarily precede the settlement ofthe Tibetan frontier question.  At  present the condition of that  province is muchdisturbed.   (And see Reports Nos. 65 and 76.)     Intended Austrian Outpost on the Pamirs.   Sir J. Jordan learns that 100 Austrianprisoners have  been  detailed by the Bolshevist  Government to replace the Cossackoutpost at Tashkurgan on the Pamirs.   The attention of  the Chinese  Government hasbeen called to the matter.   The Taoyin of Kashgar has issued orders that the Austriansare to be prohibited from entering.                                    FRANCE.    Goal Shortage.-M. Loucheur has made representations  to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment regarding the grave shortage of coal in France and the arrears in its supply from great Britain ;  direct appeals have been made to the British miners by M. Clemenceauand Marshal Foch.                                     ITALY.    Statement  by  signer  Giolitti. A.  Press message  of  August 12th  reports : &quot; The  Provincial Council  of  Cuneo  has re-elected as its  President  Signor Giolitti(the former  Premier)  who  in   his  presidential  speech  paid  an   enthusiastictribute . to  the  heroism   of  the   Italian  soldiers.   &apos; On  the  Piave,&apos;  he   said,&apos; they defeated an  enemy  far  superior  in  numbers, and  on the French front theyvictoriously withstood the German forces.  Now we can look forward with the greatestconfidence to the future, and we can  hope for the  speedy liberation  of  our brothers-who are groaning under the enemy^ yoke.   May 1918 bring us nearer to the end ofthis horrible carnage and the world be enabled by a just peace to return to civilisedlife, progress and liberty.  But it must be a peace and not a truce, not a return to thepolicy  of armaments and preparation for newr conflicts.   All the nations must under-stand the absolute necessity of great internal and international reforms, based uponjustice and liberty, for if the representative-  assemblies  and the different peoplescontinue to have no decisive influence on the foreign policy of  their countries,  and ifthe relations between the nations continue to be settled by the old rules of diplomacy,it will  be vain to hope for a sure peace, and the progress of science will only render-future, conflicts much more terrible.   Let us hope that in the  study of internal and international reforms the ancient political and juridical science of Italy  will displayits full brilliance.&apos; &quot;
                                     JAPAN.     Riots in connection with Price of  Rice. Sir C. Greene reports that owing to a sudden and unwarrantable increase in the -price of rice, riots have broken out at Kobe,Osaka, Kyoto and Nagoya, necessitating the calling cut  of troops.  It is stated thatthe Japanese Government will spend  10,000,000 yen in the purchase of accumulatedstocks.   Large  donations have already been  made  to  the  poor  by  the  ImperialHousehold  and various rich men, and prices have already fallen considerably.    NICARAGUA.(See under &quot;Honduras.&quot;)                                  PORTUGAL.    Opening of Gongress.-In a despatch dated July 25th, Sir  L. Carnegie reports theofficial opening of Congress on. July 22ad,  by Senhor Sidonio Paes.  The President     G273-Sb                              B     Visit of American  Socialists. Italian Wireless  of August 14th, 16th and 20threports the reception of  the American Socialist Mission by the Italian Socialist Union,the Ministers Bissolati  and  Berenini, the Roman Proletariat Organisations, and theSocialist Mayor of Milan.  It  is expected  that the Mission, will pay  a  brief visit to theItalian front.     Allied Policy regarding Austria  and the Subject  Nations. Italian  Wireless ofAugust 14th, 15th, 18th, 19th  and 20th expatiates on  the  cpiestion  of the Austriansubject nationalities, eg. :      &quot; The Premier,  Signor Orlando,  after having received  the Rumanian Committeeand  assured  them that  Italian policy will  always be on the side of  the  oppressednations, has  now received the Jugo-Slav Committee headed by President  Trumbic.The proceedings are sympathetically commented upon in  the  Italian Press.   ThePopolo Romano says that Italy is particularly entitled to direct the politics of oppressed speoples because of her own history and traditions.  The firm, decision of &quot;the ItalianGovernment to co-operate with all oppressed nationalities must therefore be applauded   ,   .  .  The Popolo  Romano discusses  English recognition of a  Checho-SlovakNational Council.  It says that the statement  on  the subject has  the  highest politicaland military importance.   Politically it is the first step towards the recognition of therights of other  oppressed  nationalities.  Italy,  who first  officially  recognised  theChecho-Slovaks, now awaits the  recognition of the independence  of the Jugo-Slavson the basis  of the Corfu  Convention.....Interventionist newspapersexpress the hope that the English  Government&apos;s  official   action wdll  be followedwith  the  utmost speed  by similar declarations  by, all Allied  Governments.   Thisis expressed  in  a   leading  article  in.  the Gorriere  Sera  by  Depuiy  Agnelli,in the Secolo  by Mussolini,  Director of  the  Popolo  d&apos;Ilalia,  and  by  a leadingarticle in the Socialist Journal del Popolo.   The Press unanimously  states  that it isnow  an  acknowdedged fact that not  merely all Allied Governments but also the peoples are fighting  for the dismemberment of Austria.....  The Messaggero and numerous provincial papers  state that we must expect imminent  official recognitionof ..the oppressed nationalities on the part  of  all the Allied  Governments.....The   Pepolo  Romano  insists  on. the  necessity  of  the  Entente  proclaiming theunited independence of the Bohemian, Rumanian, Polish,   and  Jugo-Slav peoples,because such a proclamation wdll also prove that  nobody any longer  believes in thepossibility of detaching Austria from Germany.  Every enemy intrigue will be  foiledthrough  this attitude on  Italy&apos;s part, and  Italy should be the first  to  proclaimthe independence of  the people subject to Austria.  The Gorriere  delta Sera and  theSocialist Giornale del Popolo  develop this theme, and  urge the need  of absolutedismemberment of Austria, in which policy a.11 the xVllied Governments and peoplesmust  unite.&quot;   (See also under &quot;Austria-Hungary.&quot;)
was everywhere  cordially acclaimed.  The Monarchist Deputies and Senators did not join  in the  applause which greeted  his  entry to  the  Chamber,  but otherwisemaintained a respectful attitude.  In the course of his speech, Senhor Paes alluded tohis recognition by the Powers,  and lightly touched on his good  relations with theAllies, Spain and the Ploly  See.  Of Great Britain alone he spoke at  considerable.length.  &quot;Our ancient Ally,&quot; Senhor Paes said,  &quot;has always  recognised the valourof our soldiers, the sincerity of our  co-operation, and our loyalty to our engagementsby repeated expressions of an appreciation which she is  ever ready to accord  to  our good  qualities, and which she has so publicly proclaimed by raising the status of herdiplomatic representative in Portugal.  In the frankest  and most  loyal harmony wehave  discussed with  England our most vital interests, which have  never before been so closely bound up  with hers, both in  Europe  and in  the Colonies.  With her, weare now engaged in treating diplomatically, and also  with the help of military experts,a problem of sentimental as well as military importance, namely,  the  well-deservedreplacement of those valiant soldiers of  ours who have for so long been  doing honourto the fame  of Portugal in  foreign parts.   Hitherto military necessities and thecircumstances of the moment have prevented such substitution on a large scale, but Ihave  every hope that we  shall shortly be able to fulfil this national aspiration.&quot;     The  extremely  partisan  spirit which characterised the  Presidents utterances,and the absence of any but the- vaguest indications  of the  Government programme,were  severely criticised by the Press, the Monarchist papers especially making mockof this &quot; Speech from the Throne,&quot;  as unworthy to rank with similar declarations byheads of  States in other countries.  It was subsequently explained, however, by theGovernment organ that the  speech was not to be considered   as  a  Presidentialmessage,  but only as an  expression of  the Presidents thanks for  the  confidence inhim  expressed by Congress.   That no  hint  of the legislation to. he submitted to congress, beyond  the  revision of  the Constitution,  was  contained in the speech, maypartly be  explained by the fact that for  some time past decree  upon decree has  been published instituting reforms and enforcing legislation which, under other conditions,would have been submitted  to the  discussion  and decision of  Congress.  A  decree,for instance, dated 28th June, providing that.the State finances should be canned on by the &quot; douzieme &quot;  system, was followed  on the  15th July by  the publication  of adecree containing the budget for the year 1918-19, which, the preamble  stated, itwas   more convenient to put into  force  by  that  method than  by  submitting itto  Congress, in  view  of  the fact  that  Parliament would be fully  occupied with  the  revision  of   the  Constitution  and  other  inrportant  matters.   It  issymptomatic  of  Portuguese  politics in  general,  and  of the present resignation of the country  to  the methods  of  &quot; Presidential ism &quot; that  such  an  infractionof  the   rights  of  the &apos; people&apos;s   representatives   has  so  far   been  allowed  topass  almost without  remark.  Whether Congress will remain  subservient  to the presidents wishes and maintain unaltered, the  measures decreed  by him while stillunfettered by a Legislature yet remains to be  seen.   The Government  Party may or may  not  comprise,  as is stated, a large number of Monarchists, but it is at  leastuncertain how far the President can count  on implicit obedience from his miscellaneousfollowing of  personal supporters  recruited at  a moments notice.  As regards theofficial Monarchists&apos; minority in the  Congress,  they have, through  their spokesman,Senhor Ayres cPOrnellas, King Manoebs &quot;lieutenant,&quot;  declared  their  intention of supporting the President in questions  of international policy, national;economy, andthe preservation of order, and of abstaining from any revolutionary method of pressingtheir particular political  views.  In the  sphere of practical politics  the  President haslately caused  the  question  of food control to  be energetically taken in hand, and haspersonally identified himself to  a large extent with  a vigorous campaign against foodhoarders.   This  question,  which  has  been much  mismanaged  hitherto,  and  inconnection  with which  Senhor Paes has incidentally  lost the support of  SenhorMachado  Santos,  is  a vital one for the popularity of his Government among the masses.   His  overthrow  of the democrats  gained him from the first  the good, wishes ofthe more well-to-do classes,  anti  he is now evidently making a serious attempt  to win the approval of the crowd, hampered though he is by a succession of strikes, reasonable and.  unreasonable, some of which  may well  be fomented  by  his  beaten opponents.Hie insinuations spread  abroad by the latter to his detriment were doubtless in his mind when he said  in his  speech to Congress :   The  revolution of December &apos;5thwas  made for the people: with my eyes  ever fixed  on the people I governed duringthe period of dictatorship ;  and with all my heart I  now desire that Government may still continue to be carried on for the benefit of the people henceforward.

According toa report received by the Foreign Office, Count Burian, presumably emboldened by therecent German defeats and  resulting need of  Austrian assistance, has lately adopted a much stiller attitude towards the Germans, and has expressed himself as confidentcf securing an Austrian solution of the Polish question.  Another  report indicates that the visit of Prince Janusz Radziwill, Director of the  Polish Political Department,and Count Ronikier to  Hintze, Helfferich and Hatzfeldt  at German Headquarters, wasprovoked by the Polish Government itself, which was particularly anxious to know theviews  of Germany regarding the partition of  Galicia; upon these views the wholegeneral policy of the Polish Government  is stated to  depend.  The Polish Govern-ment  is  said  to  insist  also upon the Austrian  claim  to have an  equal  voice withGermany in the settlement of Polish affairs.  (See  also under &quot; Peace Discussions.&quot;)    Parliament  and Government in Austi-ia. In a Memorandum  (G.T. 5431, dated august 15th) the Political Intelligence Department deals with  the internal politicaland Parliamentary situation in Austria during the spring and  early summer of thisyear ;  and concludes that  &quot; it is impossible for the Austrian Government to carry out any consistent policy within Austria&apos;s present geographical  and constitutional frame-work.  The  different  governmental  crises are  in  themselves  of  no  fundamental importance, because they are merely the symptoms  of  the one permanent, incurablecrisis  which has its root in  the  nature of  the Austrian State and which now  saps its government organisation.&quot;  (See also Report No. 70.)    Austro-TIungarian Economic Friction. It appears from Az Ujsdg of July 26thand 27th,  Az Est of July  27th, and the Magyarorszag of July  28th, that there isconsiderable friction between Austria and  Hungary over the  supply of flour and coal,the Hungarians complaining that Austria is threatening them with a reduction of  thecoal supply unless they provide her wdth more  flour.    Criticism of British Recognition of Czecho-Slovahs. An official telegram fromVienna (August 17th) dealing wdth the official recognition  by Great Britain  of thestatus of the Czecho-Slovaks (see Appreciation of Report No.  81), says :     &quot; The form  and contents of this latest declaration  of the British government must  most  emphatically be repudiated.   The Czecho-Slovak National  Council is  aCommittee  of private  persons  wdio  have no mandate from  the  Czech people and still less  from the Czecho-Slovak nation, which latter  only exists in the imaginationof the Entente.   It  is just as  absurd to represent  this  Committee as  the future government which, consequently, does not yet exist.  In reference to the so-called
Czecho-Slovak army,  it may constitute  a part  of  the Entente  army, hut  it cancertainly  not  be an ally of the  Entente  in  the  sense  of  international law.   It  isAvell known to us that only a small fraction of the so-called Czecho-Slovak army areAustrian or even Hungarian citizens of Slovak tongue.   These disloyal elements areguilty of perjury and will,  despite the  Entente&apos;s recognition of them, be regarded andtreated by  us as traitors.  It cannot be permitted that people which have alwaysfulfilled their  duties as Austrian and Hungarian citizens and whose sons, as members-of thq Austro-Hungarian army, have fought  bravely against the Entente  shall havesuspicion cast upon them by methods  such as those employed  in the  British officialdeclaration. The Austro-Hungarian Government reserves its steps in this connection.&quot;According to  a Vienna telegram, the Neve Freie Presse says:-&quot;Great Britain&apos;srecognition of  the  Czecho-Slovaks is ambiguous, because  hitherto  a nation has never  been  recognised   internationally.   The  recognition  of  a  nation  is  asrepugnant to common sense  as the  recognition  of  any other  phenomenon.   a nation  exists  no  matter whether   it   is  recognised   or  not.   If   England,however,  desired  to  combine the  recognition of a nation with the recognition of aState, this is still more inconsistent, because  a State must have three characteristics,namely, government, a people, and a territory.  The Czecho-Slovak brigade recognised by England as an allied belligerent army has not  the least influence. Nowhere  isthat characteristic of  government visible which is indispensable  to  the  State idea.Not  even in Russia  would one  speak of Czecho-Slovak territory.  A State furtherrequires  self-determination as regards its  foreign relations.   The Czecho-Slovakspossess neither laws nor that limited part  of  the  globe  which since nomadic life wasreplaced by settled life must be regarded  as the characteristic of  a State.   The.Czecho-Slovaks, moreover, cannot be  regarded  as a  people, because,  apart  fromagitation, the  Czechs have nothing in common with the Slovaks.&quot;  (And see aboveunder &quot; Italy.&quot;)     Penalty for Possession of Italian Propaganda  Pamphlets.

The bearing of  the  Mittel-Europa  idea upon Eastern  policy, world-trade prospects,  and the rights of the various States of  Central  Europe, is illustrated by views recently expressed in  the  German newspapers.  Thus Robrbach (Weser 29, ii) declares: &quot;Our Eastern policy must  be continued.  Only an incle- pendent Finland in the north,  an autonomous Ukraine  in the  south, and  a  Baltic- Lithuanian-Polish area in the  middle, joined  to  Mittel-Europa, can  so  assure  our future power in the East that we can do without Russian  friendship.&quot;  Vorwarts,  on the other hand,  referring to the  Emperor KaiTs visit  to main  Headquarters, says :  &quot; At the eleventh  hour we utter a  warning against engaging the  German people&apos;s honour for kingdoms built on quicksands and against the manufacturing of states, the creation of which might react on the Central Powers in ways which at present are still uncertain.  The German people are fighting for Germany, not for Poland, Lithuania, Courland, Esthonia, and Livonia,  ddie miserable Brest-Litovsk peace is not worth the bones of a single German soldier.&quot;     The Magdeburgische Zeitung of July 31st  advocates  the abandonment of  Mittel- Europa in return for most-favoured-nation treatment in the world.  The Kreuzzeivung of July 29th discovers that a closer union with Austria-Hungary is utterly  impossible, and  that  world-trade, for which most-favoured-nation treatment  is necessary, is essential for Germany.  The Bavarian point of view appears in the Berliner Tageblatl of August, 3rd and  the Kolnische  Zeitung of August  5th, both  of  which  insist  on considerable modifications in  the scheme as hitherto contemplated.

     Propaganda  regarding the  &quot;Anglo-Saxon,  Raw Materials  Trust.&quot; german wireless  states : &quot; Tire  wireless service at Carnarvon of August 14th, endeavoursonce again to play off the Anglo-Saxon domination of raw materials against German,and states that even Nauen is forced to admit the superiority of England and Americain  many  articles  of  world  trade.  The  English  writer of the  messages does  not without a reason  conceal against whom it is that superiority  makes  itself so  muchfelt.  Germany is not  dependent upon England and  North America for coal, iron,sugar, wheat, oats and so  forth.   All these good things Germany produces in excessof her requirements, or receives them, like petroleum, from the  Near  East.  Oa theother hand, the Allies are dependent upon the Anglo-American Raw Materials Trust.France, if she were, for instance, to be cut off from cheap  German coal and wanted to  buy English coal  in its place, wroulcl no  longer be capable of competing in  the markets of the world, and Italy&apos;s metal  industry and  shipbuilding trade would, byan  economic war, be  delivered  over to the mercies of her Anglo-Saxon purveyors ofraw materials, and  England, to whom  all the overseas markets  are open, cannotsatisfy the pressing requirements of her Allies  now.   How then, can she be desirous of dominating the  German market also ? &quot;     Resources of the Central Powers in  Natural Mineral  Oils. A report  dated august 9th indicates that,  apart from potential supplies from Russia, the positionin  the Central Powers with regard to mineral  oils is shortly as  follows :---Sufficientpetrol for urgent  military requirements  can apparently be made  available, but  thesupply of lubricating oils  is far short of the actual needs, and in  consequence railwayrolling  stock  and all kinds of machinery and plant are suffering constant deterioration-tion. Moreover, as  the  demand continues  to  increase, in  default of  substantial improvement  in the  quantity and quality of supplies, the  position can only become more and more serious.     The weekly report of the Berlin Stock Exchange issued by German Wireless onAugust 19th speaks of a  rise in petroleum shares &quot;owing to the  favourable develop-ment of the wells in Rumania.&quot;     German Schemes for  controlling the Russian Cotton Trade, A Moscow firm  hascircularised various German banks to the following effect: &quot; Reduction of crops  andtransport difficulties  have .caused Russian spinners to  look for  their cotton less toTurkestan and Persia and more  to America.  After the war English  firms must be prevented from securing  the monopoly.of supplying  the Russian  markets, and  this aim can be obtained by Riga and/or  Revai  taking the place previously occupied byBremen, always assuming that Germany will retain one or both  of the Baltic  ports.The  German banks  will  have an  excellent  opportunity of buying the  cotton from america and selling it on easy terms to the Russian spinners.   A similar arrangementmay take effect in  Odessa with regard to  Egyptian cotton.&quot;     Prince Liehnowsky.

Mr. Young reports  that a serious position has been reached in connection with a  boundary dispute between  Honduras  andNicaragua, the latter having refused to comply with the King of Spain&apos;s arbitration award  of 1900.  Troops have been  despatched to  the  disputed  locality  by  theGovernment of Honduras.   Mr. Barclay reports that  the  Minister of  Honduras hasexplained to  the United States Government that these troops were  being  sent to expel a Nicaraguan force which had occupied a town in the zone awarded to Honduras.ddie Minister  was urged to advise his government to  suspend action pending theresult of  an investigation instituted on the spot by the  United States Government.                                   MEXICO.     Oil Taxation. Mr. Barclay,  on August 13th,  reports  that  the  oil  companies are endeavouring to agree upon united action (which he  considers most important)in regard  to the oil  decree  (see Report No. 81).    Mr.  Thurstan reports that onAugust 14th the Mexican Government published in the Press Mr. Cummins&apos; protestof April 30th,  together  with a reply dated  August  12th,  addressed  directly  to1I.M. Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.   The reply denies the  rightof a foreign  Government to protest against a  decree issued by  virtue of  Mexico&apos;srights as an independent  nation; the  remedy lies  in  the Mexican(Courts-; theprotest is rejected.  On August  13th the United  States  Ambassador presented  a protest,  drawing attention  to  the necessity  which  might  arise  of  protecting the  property of  United States   citizens  in  Mexico injuriously  affected  by thedecrees.  President  Carranza  repeated that  the  remedy  hvy  with the  MexicanCongress   and   Courts,  and  refused   to   extend  the  time  for  considerationof the  matter.  A  new  decree  was,  however,    published   on  August  14th,dated August 12th, but most  probably  drafted  on  the night of  August  13th  ; thisannounces  that recognised oil lands for the  exploitation of which  money has  been
Invested, and which have not been manifested under the decree of  July 31st, cannot he denounced, and the owners or operators who have not filed manifests may continueto operate  on payment of an annual  rent  of  5  Mexican  dollars  and  a  royalty  of5 per cent.  On August 16th the Eagle Company filed manifests under  protest.   Onthe same date  Mr. Barclay reports  that the  new taxation will be  very heavy ; theUnited  States  Government  does  not, however,  seem  disposed to intervene.   OnAugust 17th Mr. Thurstan expresses his opinion that the support of the  Governmentsconcerned  is essential ;  otherwise,  the companies  may be driven, e.g.,  to supportPelaez.     A Washington Press message  dated  August 15th states  that it is  understoodthat  the  Allies  need  this  year  430,000,000  barrels  of crude oil, of  which  theUnited States&quot;produce about 315,000,000.  The Mexican oilfield can supply 130,000,000.&quot; Under the latest decree  Mexico attempts to make oil national property.  Mexicanpetroleum would.,then become contraband,  and consecmently unsaleable by a neutralGovernment to a belligerent, under international law.&quot;     Possibility of German  Loan   to Carranza. Mr.  Thurstan  suggests  that  theGermans may possibly arrange a cash loan  to Carranza  by establishing  a credit  in spain, and financing the Mexican   cotton  crop; the  growers accepting  drafts  onMadrid  from the Mexican Government, which would then sell the cotton to the mauu-facturers for cash and drafts  on New York.     United States-Mexican Agreement for Interchange of Commodities. The UnitedStates War Trade Board  has agreed to send 30,000 tons  of grain  to Mexico and  toissue export licences on  a  liberal  scale for certain important foodstuffs, includingcorn products,  dried  or  condensed milk,  tinned fish and pork.   It will  also  sendsupplies of  agricultural  and mining machinery.   Metal  manufactures and  other commodities will be  exported to Mexico so far as United States requirements permit.The  United States  Government  asks that  the Mexican  Government will in  returnfacilitate exports to the United States of  Mexican produce not required in Mexico,&apos;and prohibit the  re-export from Mexico  of the  commodities  sent from  the UnitedStates.                                 NETHERLANDS.      Endeavours  to form New Cabinet. Sir W. Townley, on August 16th, reported the arrival of Mr. van Nispeu at  The Hague.  There  is  some reason to think&apos; that Mgr. Nolens did not really want  him, but produced him  in order to provoke some better man to offer himself from  the Anti-Revolutionary Party.  (Mr. van Nispeu has been made aware by Mr. Louclon that  grave external and  internal  difficulties will have to be dealt with, and that the proposed  administration would be suspected  by the  Entente  Governments  as a probable  instrument  for  a  peace propaganda.) Mgr. Nolens subsequently handed to the  Queen the list of his Cabinet, in which his.- own  name  did not  appear; it seems that this  omission was interpreted by her as implying the return of his  mandate which  has been  officially announced.  It is- reported  that on August 19th Her Majesty sent for Mr. Savornin Lohmann, and that on the 20th she summoned Mr. Colijn.  (See Reports Nos. 79-81.)      Telefunken Communication  with Dutch Colonies. The Dutch Press  announces that an order has been given to the Telefunken. Company  for a wireless installation to connect Holland wdth her Colonies.      German  Threat  to ruin  Rotterdam. De Telegraaf  of  June 12th publishes  an article warning&apos;the Dutch of the  intention of the Germans to construct  a ship canal connecting the Rhine  and  the Ems,   which  would  make Germany  practically independent of Dutch waterways.  If this scheme were adopted, the Dutch part of the Rhine and other rivers would not  be  deep enough  to  accommodate Dutch traffic. Quotations are made from a pamphlet by an advocate  of Colmar, showing that while it is the intention of the Germans in any case to construct  this canal, the plans may be modified if Holland is docile, in which case Rotterdam will  be  allowed to retain a proportion  of its transit trade.   Otherwise Germany will  divert the whole of the German Rhine traffic from Rotterdam to Emdeii.
    Demands of Officers of lost Requisitioned Ships. The Dutch Press (August 13th)reports  a  meeting at Utrecht  attended  by over  200  former, officers  of  vesselsrequisitioned by  the  Associated  Governments.  It was stated that in view  of  thefact that ten of these  ships have already been lost Idol]and will only recover a portionof her merchant  fleet after the war, and many officers will  be  without  work.  an endeavour must, therefore, be made to secure compensation.   After discussion it wasdecided that no  action  should be  taken against shipowners,  but that the dutch government should be urged to bring the matter before  the Associated Governments.Should  the Dutch  Government be unable to  do  this,  officers-should appeal direct to the Associated  Governments, resorting to a civil suit if necessary.

Norwegian Tonnage Agreement. In  a Memorandum (G.T. 5130), dated August17th, the Shipping Controller gives a  detailed appreciation of the operation of theNorwegian Tonnage Agreement concluded in  June 1917 (see Reports Nos. 21  and 22)under which Norway secured the maintenance of her coal and coke supplies,  and theAllies obtained the use of the wdiole of  the Norwegian Mercantile Marine  except  suchtonnage as was necessary to maintain Norway&apos;s essential imports.   British exports ofcoal to Norway, except during the past two  months  (owing to. shortage of  output),and imports of iron  ore, timber, and fish from Norway have been  satisfactory.  TheAmlue of the convoy sj-stem is clearly indicated.                                    PERU.     Proposed Arbitration Treaty. The  Foreign Office informs Mr. Reunie  that HisMajesty&apos;s Government is prepared in principle to negotiate  an  Arbitration Treatywdth the Peruvian  Government, in accordance with the proposal of the latter (seeReport No. 79), but instructs him to suggest  that certain outstanding disputes might with advantage be cleared up before such Treaty should take effect.                                    SPAIN.    Attitude toxoards  Germany. Sir  A.  Hardinge  reports  that, according  to  theSpanish Foreign  Minister, the  Spanish Ambassador in Berlin has been instructed to insist upon the cessation of the submarine war  against the Spanish  merchant fleet,failing which the German  ships in Spanish ports will  be seized as  compensation.It appears  that Sehor Maura entirely approved of this communication,  while SenorCambo  and Senor Alba were  mildly  opposed to it.  On the advice of the AlliedAmbassadors the Spanish Government has taken  precautions against the  damagingof the German  ships  by their  own crews.   It appears  that,  in  the  absence of  theImperial Chancellor and the  Foreign Secretary  from  Berlin,  the  acting foreign secretary  has informed the -Spanish  Ambassador that  Germany  cannot  abandonsubmarine  operations against Spanish  shipping as this would involve their abandon-ment  in the  case of  all other neutrals.   The attitude and language of the Germanand  Austrian  Ambassadors towards  the   Spanish  Foreign  Minister have beenthreatening, though  according to information received  by  Sir  A.  Hardinge, it isdoubtful whether they  will carry their threats into action (and see  next paragraph).    Allied Policy and the Internal Situation in Spain. In a despatch dated July 27th,Sir A. Hardinge sets  out various considerations affecting Allied policy with regard to spain.  The Church in Spain is not so much anti-Ally as  anti-French.   Protestantism,
 whether British, American  or German, interests it much less than disestablishment and the persecution of the friars in France.  Since, however,  the British are now associated with the French, the Church is still,  in  the main, as  far  as they also are concerned, an active and powerful enemy, especially away from the great  cities where its influence meets  with little opposition.   With  regard to  Regionalism, this  is not really, if properly managed, revolutionary or dangerous  to  the  monarchy, though it has since the Assemblea de los Parlamentarios at Barcelona last summer been actively taken up  by.the Extreme Left, and the scheme of  Constitutional  Reform which  Sehor Cambo and Senor Alba both appeared to favour, and have not since disavowed, is in regard to federalism not unlike that of 1873.   Spain was, however,  both regionalist and on the whole loyal to her kings till the beginning of the 18th century, when the liberties of Aragon and Catalonia were suppressed ; for  a King  of Spain  is neither Castilian  nor  Catalan nor Galician. but  the  common  property and traditional ruler of all these realms.  He is equally at  home at Saragossa, at Valencia, at Seville, and at San Sebastian,  whilst an elected President has a provincial as well as a national status, identifying him more closely wdth his  birthplace or adopted home, and it was the centrifugal tendencies  let loose  by the  proclamation of the  Republic in 1373 (which led,  not only great towns like  Carthagena, but small  villages like Jumilla, to declare themselves independent commonwealths, and the  northern lands, Navarre and the Basque  country to proclaim Don Carlos as the champion  of Home  Rule) that proved fatal to the  Republican experiment,  whether  in  a centralised  or in any reasonable federal  form.   Upon  the  question  whether stronger  pressure could  with advantage he brought to bear upon the  Spanish Government for the purpose of bringing it more actively and openly  toward the side of the Allies (short of  actually breaking or compromising  its neutrality) there  is a certain divergence  of opinion between  the United States  Embassy and those of  Great Britain and  France.  In  the opinion of Sir A. Hardinge  and  his French  colleagues,  the practical results  of a more drastic policy would not compensate its possible dangers.&apos; The Spanish masses, while regarding the Kaiser as an ambitious tyrant and hoping that he may be  soundly beaten, are quite determined that Spain shall not be  drawn,  if they can help it, into war or clanger of Avar.  This attitude of the  \Arorking classes cannot  fail to affect  the Spanish Govern- ment&apos;s  own resolve  to maintain  a  strict neutrality as distinct  from  one clearly benevolent to  the Allies.   Any marked  departure from the strictly  neutral policy might break up the Government itself,  and the present  happy compromise might end in disaster, perhaps  letting in a military regime  under La Cierva.  It should  also be remembered that no Spanish Government, however  strong, will have the  courage in the present state of  public opinion to  abandon strict neutrality so long as the military issue of the. Avar in Europe  appears uncertain ;  further, that  the  more  the Allies  can avoid any  appearance  of encouraging or applauding, however indirectly, revolutionary principles subversive of monarchy and of property, the more likely they are to retain the goodwill of the forces which at present  really count in Spain.  The power of  the German Embassy to intimidate rests not so much upon the contingent menace of the German  army  or the actual menace of the German submarines  as upon, first, the doubt whether  Germany Avill not beat the Allies on the  Continent of  Europe (or in other words whether Spain had  better not &quot; wait  and see&quot;); secondly,  on the fear that if  a   diplomatic  rupture Avere to come,  and if Germany had  no  more  to gain&apos; through the goodwill of Spain, she might ruthlessly organise  internal revolution and sabotage.  It therefore seems that the maintenance  of the present Government in office must be  the  aim, not merely  of patriotic  Spaniards, but also  of the Allies themselves.  -                                    SWEDEN.     Black-Listed  Firms  and the Swedish  Agreement.-Sir  E. Howard reports that considerable dissatisfaction  is  being expressed  in  Sweden at the fact that  no black- listed Swedish firms have yet had their names removed from the  list, as&apos;Avas expected from the discussions proceeding in London, so. as to enable them  to import under  the Swedish  Agreement.  Sir E. Howard  has  suggested to the Swedish  authorities that the suspect firms should submit their cases direct to the Legation.     Sweden, Germany,  Finland,  and the  Aland  Islands.- Sir  E. Howard  reports discussion  in the Swedish  Press  of a recent intimation by Mr. Branting that  the Germans, after arranging matters to  their  satisfaction in Finland, would attempt to gain the favour  of Sweden  by compelling the Finns to give  her the Aland Islands.
Mr. Branting hinted that negotiations to this effect were proceeding between Germanyand  the  Swedish  Tory activists.  The danger  to  Sweden of such a transaction  is pointed out by  both Social  Democraten and Aftontidning. the latter declaring  that sweden does not desire  to play the same part as Finland is playing with regard .toGermany.  The article  proceeds  to justify  the action  taken by England  on theMurman Coast,  and explains that Sweden  need not be frightened into  the arms  ofGermany  by fear  of English domination in  the Kola Beninsula any more than bythe fear formerly exploited by the activists that England was aiming at a protectoratein the Baltic.  (And see under &quot; Finland.&quot;)                                SWITZERLAND.    Reported  German-Swiss-Bolshevist Liaison.- Sir II. Rumbold learns  that a SwissSocialist of  Austro-Swiss origin named&apos;Carl  Moor,  recently left Berne  for Moscow,ostensibly to establish consular and commercial relations between Switzerland and the bolshevist Government.  This man is a friend of Lenin, and in .1.915 he twice  visitedItaly in order to influence Socialist opinion  against Italian intervention;  hejs  statedto be in touch with Parvus (see Reports Nos. 50, 5-1-, 67, and 71), who is liaison betweenthe Bolshevists and the German Imperial Socialists of the Lensch group  ; he is thusqualified to take a prominent part in the International Socialist peace offensive  whichthe Germans have for a considerable time been engineering.  His present  appointmentis said to be due to the Olten Committee of Swiss Socialists who wished  to  keep the bolshevist Government in power, and intimidated the Federal Government, by  threats of a general strike, into detailing Moor fen-  this Mission, which is designed to  secureofficial recognition to the Bolshevist Government and its representatives.  It is furtherbelieved that the presence of the Dutch Socialist,  M. Troelstra, in Switzerland isconnected  wdth this demarche.  According to the  French-Swiss  Press, Moor  wasreceived before  his  departure  by the Minister of  Public  Economy  without thecognisance of the Government, which  at present  denies  knowledge of  his mission.The Daily Review of August 15th quotes the following Berne message of August15th :     &quot; An official contradiction is given to  a recent newspaper statement  to the effectthat M. Carl Afoor, Socialist Deputy for Berne, had started for  Russia on importantbusiness after  a long interview with  M. Schultess, member  of the  Federal Counciland head of the Department of Public Economy/who was said to have entrusted him with an official mission  involving more particularly the conclusion of a  Treaty ofCommerce and the recognition of the Soviet Government by.the Swiss  Government.It is declared that these statements are entirely incorrect.  M. Moor, it is explained,having excellent relations with  Russia, merely commuuicated  two messages  to theRussian Government in  connection with  his  visit  to Moscow, where  he renderedvaluable services to the Swiss residents in the  country, and he had offered  to  take steps towards establishing commercial relations between Russia and Switzerland and towards providing additional food  supplies for  Switzerland.   M. Schultess informedM. Moor that owing to questions of. transit and other circumstances it would be  verydifficult to establish such relations, and he pointed out that the Russo-Swiss Treaty ofCommerce which had  been denounced by M.  Kerensky during his period of office would  expire  on November 1st  and  that in  spite of formal inquiries the SwissLegation was still in the dark as to the attitude of the Russian Government in regardto M.  Kerensky&apos;s action in this matter, and it was  impossible  therefore to say whatthe state of affairs would be after November 1st.   Only questions of  an economicnature were  discussed  at  this interview, and no allusion  whatever  was made to political affairs.   The  question of swiss recognition of the  present Russian Govern-ment was not touched upon  at all.  M. Moor, in short, was entrusted with no kind of mission by the Federal Department of Public Economy.&quot;     Sir II. Runibold transmits a  suggestion  that the Associated Governments mightcounter any swiss approximation to the Bolshevists by pressure in connection with thesupply of foodstuffs.     The Olten Soviet. In a  despatch dated  July 31st, Sir H. Runibold reports theactivities of the Socialist Committee of Olten, &quot;which may  be- said  to  centralise the Socialist and Labour agitation of Switzerland.&quot;  The substance of the  despatch wdllbe given in next weelPs issue of this Report.     Ex-King  Gonstantine s Entourage. The Foreign Office learns that the Swiss Government has not yet been able  to secure the dismissal by Ex-King Constantine of
his Aide-de-Camp, M.  Paparigoponlos.   The  Greek Minister at  Berne has  been instructed to press for the expulsion from Switzerland of MM. Paparigopoulos,  Streit,and Theotokis.  (And see Reports Nos. 56 and 64.)    Attempted  Acquisition  of  Tonnage in Spain.-HSir A.  Hardinge  reports  thatM. Cailler, who  has been endeavouring to  obtain  tonnage in Spain for Swiss require-ments (see Reports Nos. 72,77, and 78), now reports that he can practically obtain onlya  single vessel for a single voyage, the rest having been requisitioned by the SpanishGovernment for trade with  America.  M. Cailler  represents that  Switzerland  is onthe verge of famine, which might lead to serious political complications.     Attitude  regarding British Declaration of Commercial Policy.  Sir Id. Rumboldreports that the  Swiss Government in a preliminary reply to notes based on despatchesfrom  the  Foreign Office, dated respectively June 15th and  29th  (see Report No. 78under &quot;General&quot;), has  pointed  out the dependence of  Switzerland upon her  own industries, and  her further  dependence upon foreign countries for the sale of  herproducts  and the obtaining of raw materials.   The opinion  is expressed that  thepolicy contemplated by His M.ajesty&apos;s Government will disastrously  affect Swics tradeand commerce.                                    VATICAN.                              (See under &quot; China.&quot;)PEACE DISCUSSIONS.     This week has brought rather more peace discussions than ve have had since themilitary operations on the western front turned so decidedly in favour of the Entente.The tone of neutrals is favourable to us, and in Germany there seems to be a tendency to lose faith in the Higher Command and to turn to the League of Nations as  a meansof securing for  the  Central Powers  that  protection and opportunity for economic development which the armies are not, or may not be, able to afford.     Central Bowers. (1) The  National-Zeitung, in  reviewing the four years  of war,saj^s : &quot; Germany is fighting because it believes  it has  to fight  ...  he who desires-peace  .  . .  must recognise .  .  . there is and can be  only one  means, namely, ofstriking their strongest weapon out of the hands of the  German Generals and givingthe German people irrefragable proof that it  will flourish anew, unmutilatecl, underthe protection of the League  of Nations, and not be the victim  of any rapacity or have to suffer any violence.  Can President  Wilson furnish this.proof ? &quot;     (2) More  important  is a  second,  letter from General Count  Montgelas to theBerliner  Tageblatt.  Bis first  letter appeared  on June 30th and was  commented.upon in the Daily Review of the Foreign Press of July 11th,  In  the second letter heargues against those  who have expressed the fear that  the League might be used as a means of strangling German trade and pleads  for confidence between countries.     After sketching a Europe in which the  Poles  are to  have access to the ocean bythe Vistula, the Rumanians  by  the  Danube through the Dardanelles, and the Swissby the Rhine and the Rhone, he writes : -     &quot;Mutual  mistrust by Government of Government, by people of people, is thechief cause why no war party as a whole has dared to make such  a proposal definitelyand clearly.&quot;     ddie conversion of a  German officer to these views  is interesting ;  but it  is  mor significant that the letter should have been allowed to pass the Censor.     (-&apos;-)) The German-AAareless  communication of August 14th contained an accountof. an interview given  hy von Hintze to the Kblnische Zeitung in which he traversesthe Prime Ministebs statement that the Central Powers  had rejected  the reasonablepeace offer made by the Entente six months ago.   The German Secretary&apos;s reply is ofthe usual kind,  and as  the more  important  portions have alreacty appeared in theBritish Press further notice is unnecessary.     (4) A speech by Dr. Solf, the German Colonial Secretary,  in reply  to Mr. Balfour,appeared in the British Press on the 22ncl inst.     (5) According to  the Berliner Tageblatt  of  August 11th, Professor Quiclcle of vienna, Professor  Lammasch &apos;and  Bishop  Franknoi of Budapest, have requested theGeneral  Secretary of the Inter-Parliamentary  Union of  Christiania to suggest to theInter-Parliamentary groups  of the belligerent countries that they  should  each, appointby secret ballot their representatives to exchange views about peace possibilities.
      On behalf of the British group  Lord Weardale  has rejected  this suggestion on the ground that the idea of a secret ballot could not be entertained for a moment, and that any overtures for peace must be &quot;absolutely open and unequivocal.&quot;      Bulgaria and Turkey. Sir H.  Rumbold  (Berne)  reports information that the hatred of Germans and  Turks in Bulgaria  is  becoming more bitter. The Malinoff Government  has informed  the  peasantry that all merchandise is  for use  of that country, that Government will, not act as a German agent, that Bulgaria will  never satisfy Turkish claims, and that,  if necessary, Government are  prepared  to  conclude peace with honour.      Meetings of soldiers on leave, deserters, &amp;c, are  held all over the country wdth countenance of Government  demanding impeachment of late Cabinet, and recording that the Allies have no interest to serve in working against Bulgaria.   These meetings are often accompanied, by anti-Turkish riots.  The King is  called&apos;upon  to terminate the war, failing which the people will  be forced, to  decide the fate of the country for themselves.   It is owing to these events that the King has been advised to  absent himself for a while.  The calling up of the 1920 class has added to the discontent.      Another telegram from the same source reports that the  new Sultan of Turkey is taking a very active part in military  affairs, and that no military decisions  are now taken without his consent.      A. third telegram from Sir H. Rumbold reports that the  ex-King of  Greece  has been  officially informed by Germany  that Bulgaria&apos;^  claims  to  Salonica will  not be considered, and that it is  not certain she  will  be  allowed to keep  Drama and Kavalla.     Netherlands.-With reference to the efforts of the  Swedish Press, reported last week, to induce their Government to intervene in the  interest of peace, Sir E. Howard now  reports that on August 14th  a deputation of Swedish  Good Templars waited upon the Prime Minister with the same object.   In. reply the Prime  Minister stated that the Swedish (Government was most anxious to be able to co-operate in putting an end to the war, &quot; but if an initiative from one or more neutral  States  is  to have any prospect of success, or be of  any  use, it  is essential that the  belligerents should be willing to accept mediation.  Otherwise an offer of mediation may not only intensify antagonism between  belligerents, but also  may result in laying the  State or States offering it open  to  suspicion  and  misunderstanding  wdth serious consequences  to themselves.     &quot;So far  as  Prime  Minister  was aware there was no sign that this condition for successful mediation  existed.&quot;      The Vaderland has published  an interview with  M. van Kol, who is said  to be -coming to England.   He is of the opinion that an International Socialist Conference would be of little use at the present moment as the Allied Socialists have no confidence in  the German Socialists who appear to  be paying great attention  to the  military situation.     Rumania. On  August  13th the Rumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs stated in the Chamber that from  the clay peace was signed it was the duty of the country to maintain a strict  neutrality towards   all the Powers,  nevertheless &quot; the Treaty establishes certain relations  between us and the Central Powers which cannot be disregarded.   We are bound to the Central Powers in all that concerns our economic life, and all the world recognises the influence which the economic life exercises upon politics.  Certain  conventions  have now been  concluded at  Berlin with a Anew to carrying out this treaty.&quot;     Poland. (See also  &quot; Austria-Hungary,&quot;  page  7.)   The Polish question  was discussed at the  recent  meeting  at German  Imperial Headquarters.  The  Warsaw Government was  represented  by  Prince Janusz  Radziwill  and Count Renikier. In an interview with a representative of the Neue Freie  Presse  Count Bind an stated that the whole Polish question was discussed with  satisfactory results. &quot; It was not possible to enter into details, but a plan was drawn up  as a  result of which further negotiations will proceed very quickly.&quot;     In answer to a further question Count Burian replied : &quot; The Poles have the right to choose their own King ; details will be settled by negotiation.&quot;    According to  the Berliner  Tageblatt there are  now  five aspirants to the Polishthrone.    An account of this interview  appeared in the Morning Post of August  21st.6273-31E
                   APPENDIX                          to western and General  Report No. 82.   Part II.           TROELSTRA  AND  THE  MAJORITY  SOCIALISTS.Communicated by the Politiccd Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office.    The utterances of Troelstra to interviewers in Switzerland  make it worth while;to review the  facts, so far as they are known, as  to the  part he has  played as an intermediary between the German &quot;Majority&quot;  Socialists  and the British  Labourleaders.  In the latter part of June, when Troelstra expected  to be coming to england for the meeting of the British Labour Party on June 26th, Scheidemann visited him at Scheveningen in Holland, in  order  to  give  him first-hand information as to theviews  of  the  German &quot; Majority&quot; Social Democrats.  On June 28th the BerlinerTageblatt  published  a  communication from  its Vienna correspondent which statedthat Scheidemann had informed Troelstra that his  party &quot; no longer  insisted thattheir Stockholm memorandum should be taken as a starting point for the  discussions of the projected  conference ;  they were  ready to  accept the  memorandum of theneutral Socialists as a basis.&quot;  Had this meant that  they  were  ready to discuss theterms  of  the  neutral memorandum as a possible basis of agreement,  it would have-meant a considerable  change in their attitude.   Mr. Henderson and Camille Huysmans-took it in this sense, and, at Mr.  Henderson&apos;s  request, Brant ing (who was then inEngland)  wired to Troelstra to  enquire whether the  statement in the Berliner Tage-blaft was true. Troelstra wired back : &quot; Statement  is correct  in so far as concernsStockholm neutral proposal.&quot;  Mr. Henderson considered that he now had  first-handauthority for announcing publicly that the German &quot; Majority &quot; Socialists had changedtheir attitude.   The official statement, however, of the German Social Democrat Party-and Troelstra&apos;s own statements  in Switzerland since that date have made it plain thatthis  inference  was  incorrect.  Mr. Henderson had  understood that  the German&quot; Majority&quot; were &quot; even ready to discuss the question  of Alsace-Lorraine,&quot; since thiswas  treated  as a discussable  question  in the neutral memorandum.   As  to this,Troelstra  said  at Vevey to the Daily Mail correspondent:  &quot;German Socialists are.unanimous and would consent to  cede  it only  in  the event  of complete  militarydefeat.&quot;   In the interview with a representative of the Gazette de Lausanne (publishedAugust 2nd),  he  said :  &quot;  The German people will never accept the idea  of giving it back to Erance.  The utmost  concession  which the German Socialists can conceivewould be  that  three years after the signature  of  peace a  plebiscite  should be organised by Germany and under  Germany&apos;s control.&quot;   Even in the case  of  this lastconcession (small as  its worth would appear) the wording of this interview does  not show whether Troelstra  professed to have  any  authority from  Scheidemann  forindicating it as a possibility, or whether it was merely a  hypothesis of his own as tothe mind of the German party.   In his conversation with the Alsatian SocialistGrumbach, published in UHumanite (August 14th and 15th 1, Troelstra said : -     &quot; I do not understand on what Comrades  Henderson and Huysmans base theirdeclarations.  It is utterly incorrect to speak of a new attitude on the part of  German Social Democracy.&quot;   In the conversation he stated  that  the idea  of  a  plebiscite inAlsace-Lorraine at  a certain  period,  after the war  was favoured by the  German   Minority &quot; and that he regarded it himself as a  good one,  but  that the German&quot;Majority&quot; &quot;would not hear &quot; (ne vent  rien  savoir) of this solution.  On the otherhand, according to a  statement attributed to  Troelstra by another interlocutor, wdiichhas been  reported to  the  Foreign  Office, it would appear that  Scheidemann himself had indicated to Troelstra the idea of  a  plebiscite after the  war as the  furthest whichthe German &quot; Majority &quot; would go.
    One tiling is quite obvious, that whatever  Scheidemaim may have meant when he told Troelstra that his Party would be willing to accept the neutral memorandum as abasis, the acceptance was extremely qualified.  This raises the question of Troelstra&apos;shonesty in  his telegram to  Mr. Henderson, in which  he confirmed  the  statement ofScheidemann&apos;s acceptance of the neutral memorandum, but said nothing of the qualifications.  It was this omission by which Mr. Henderson was misled.  Troelstra&apos;sown defence, in his conversation with  Grumbach reported in JJFlumanite, is that he did not consider Scheidemann&apos;s casual acceptance of the neutral memorandum &quot;as abasis  of&apos; discussion &quot; to have any significance,  since after all. a discussion did not tiethe German Socialists in any way, and he had no idea that Mr. Henderson would build.upon this acceptance the theory which he did.   But it was the Vienna correspondentof the Berliner Tageblatt, who in the first instance  put forward the alleged acceptanceas a fact of importance; and  the fountain head of his  information must have beeneither Troelstra or Scheidernann.
