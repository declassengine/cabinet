Thefollowing appreciation of  Western Report No. 06 may here be recalled.  It was datedMay 2nd :                                                                      , ;    &quot; It seems probable that, when the Germans do open their next peace offensive,their grip  on Belgium will be  used to  the full as  a means of exacting concessionselsewhere.&quot;                               GENERAL (see page 2).

PART  II.-FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.    Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau,  the  total tonnageof 500 tons gross in the case of  steamers, and  100 tons gross in  the case of sailing-ships, reported lost owing to the  malice  of the  King&apos;s enemies  during the period july 5th-llth, inclusive, was 47,879 tons gross, of which 29,551 were British, ascompared with 82,952 tons gross, of which 52,719 were British, reported last week.    Anglo-German/Prisoners&apos;1 Agreement. An Anglo-German Prisoners&apos; agreement was signed on July I4th at  The Hague, subject  to  ratification  by the respective governments,  such  ratification being, in the case of the  German Government,dependent (according to the  German Delegates) upon a  satisfactory arrangement.regarding German civilians in China.  With  regard to  exchange of combatants and treatment  of  prisoners, the  general lines of the  Franco-German Agreement arefollowed.   There is  to  he mutual repatriation of all officers and men at present in holland.  Repatriated Germans are not to be employed  in a military capacity outsideGermany.  In exchange for 20,000 German civilians, or a less number, 4,820 Britishcombatants of all ranks, interned in  Switzerland or Holland, and 6,000 civilians willbe given ; any shortage of  the latter  figure to be made up by combatants.   german civilians in excess of the 20,000 are to be exchanged at the rate of three to one british combatant.   Civilians at present in Holland are to be repatriated.   merchant seamen of all ranks are  classed as civilians.    Treatment of British  Prisoners  in  German,;/. In a Memorandum (G.T.. 5083),dated July 11th, are reported  particulars of brutality to British and overseas prisoners in Germany, and of certain privations suffered  by those interned in Holland.  various recommendations are made.  The case of the private soldiers who are &apos;prisoners inGermany calls for particular consideration.    The &quot; Koningin  I1egentcs.&apos;n Telegraaf (July 11th) learns that the Government hasdecided to abandon the search for  the wreck of the Kdningin Eeqentes.  (See reports nos. 72-74.)ALLIED  GROUP.                                   BELGIUM.    Germany  and the Belgian Pawn. In the Main Committee of the Reichstag onJuly 11th, Count Hertling made  the following statement with regard to Belgium: &quot; With  reference to  the  future  of Belgium  ....  the  occupation and presentpossession of Belgium only means that we have a pawn for future negotiations.   Bythe expression &apos; pawn&apos; is meant  that one does not intend to keep what  one has inone&apos;s hand as  a pawn, if negotiations should bring a favourable result.  We have no intention  of  keeping  Belgium in  any  form whatever.   What we  precisely want,as  already   exx?expressed  by   me   on  February  24th,  is   that  after   the  war,restored Belgium  shall  as  a  self-dependent  State  not   be subject  to  anybodyas  a  vassal   and shall live  with us in good and friendly  relations.....&quot;German Wireless of  duly 16th  states: &quot;In connection with the  last  speech bythe German Imperial Chancellor, the representative of the  Copenhagen  newspaperPolitiken  has  been informed by  a well-informed, authoritative political  source  that....  a condition for the giving up of Belgium is that Germany shall unconditionallybe  given  back her  oversea  colonial possessions, and  that  she  shall be  allowed tomaintain  undisturbed  communication  with those colonies.   The  fate of  Belgiumdepends on this.&quot;   vorwarts  says that the  &quot;independent  Belgium&quot; of which the
Chancellor speaks is  something quite different from an  &quot;independent Flanders&quot; andan &quot; independent Wallonia.&quot;   &quot;If we are to  treat Belgium as an independent  State,we have nothing to say as to its internal affairs, and it is their own affair how Flemishand French-speaking  Belgians settle matters  after  the  occupation  is ended.&quot;  Hen-Oscar Midler, chief foreign leader-writer  of the Norddeutsche, argues that the Flemishquestion should be used as a test case to see whether the Entente  and Belgium  are willing to tackle the Belgian question in its &quot;new historical form,&quot;  and to place  thenew Belgium on the  basis of the conditions  demanded  by  the  Flemings and  manyWalloons.  The  writer  further  says that  the conception of a  pledge would not,however, be exhausted by an agreement  on Belgium, remarking : &quot; Belgium  is also,as a pledge, a means of  defence  against a future  economic war.&quot;  The Kreuz Zeilungand Tdgeszeitung voice the dissatisfaction of the annexationists with the Chancellorsdeclaration.  (And see Reports Nos. 52, 54, 50, 65, 70, 72-76.)     Port of Brussels. German  Wireless of  July 13th  reports: &quot; The work of theextension of the  Port of  Brussels, which has lasted  for  decades, has been concluded,and. the extension is  being thrown open for  use.  As a result  there is now a newwaterway between the Scheldt and Brussels which will be of the greatest importance for  future goods traffic.&quot;                                    CHINA.     Enemy Aliens. The Allied. Ministers (excepting the Belgian Minister) at Pekinghave recommended their Governments to  accept a proposal spontaneously made bythe Chinese Government for the internment  of the most dangerous enemy subjects(about 120 in number) in a temple at Fatshau, and  for  the  enforcement, with regardto enemy subjects generally, of  passport regulations as approved  by the Allies.   TheFrench Government approves these suggestions.  (And see Reports Nos. 72, 73 and 75.)     United States  and  the reported  Japanese  Loan  Negotiations. Lord Readingreports that  the United  States Minister at  Peking was  instructed in  June  that, if negotiations were proved to be in progress for  a Japanese loan to China secured on thewine and tobacco revenue and making provision for Japanese control, he should remind the Chinese Government of its obligations to the Continental and Commercial  Trustand Savings Bank of Chicago, and request assurances  that no such arrangement wasin contemplation (and &quot;see Reports Nos. 69-73).     China and the Vatican. A Rome message  (July 10th)  states  that the ChineseRepublic having expressed a desire to establish diplomatic relations  with the Vatican,the Pope has approved the appointment  of Tai-Che-Tcheng-Ling, the former Ministerto Spain and Portugal, as Chinese Minister to  the Holy See.                                   FRANCE.    France and. the Vatican. Lord Derby reports that he is without  information asto any prospective resumption  of relations  between France and  the  Vatican.   (SeeReport No. 76.)    The Mcdvy Case. The Press  reports  the  commencement  on July 16th in the senate, sitting as a High Court, of  the  trial of  M.  Malvy,  recently Minister of theInterior under  five successive  Governments.  (See  The  Times of  July 16th-18th  atpage 5 ; also reports Nos. (56 and 69.)                                 GUATEMALA.    Jidy  4-th  and  1-tih. Mr. Young  reports that July  4th and  14th have  been declared national holidays in Guatemala.                                     ITALY.     Position of Baron Sonnino. The Foreign Office is  informed that a movement,&quot;backed by the Federation of National Defence, is on foot for  the displacement of: Baron Sonnino at an early date in Anew of  his  attitude regarding the Southern Slav question.   Should he, hcnvever, give any indication of a revised attitude in the matter, this campaign would probably be abandoned, as the value of his personality as an
 asset in the Allied cause cannot be overlooked.  Symptoms of such a changed outlook have lately been apparent.  (See also Report No. 76.)     Financial Agreement zoith the  United States--Italian  Wireless  of July 16th reports: &quot;The  entire Press  comments upon the financial agreement between Italy and  America for the  regulation of  the  exchange, saying  that  the  agreement  is important financially, commercially and. politically.  Since Italy&apos;s purchases are made chiefly in the United States, the support which, the American Treasury will  give Italy will  considerably influence neutral countries and especially Switzerland and Spain. The  papers take this  opportunity  to eulogise the  Italo-American  friendship and solidarity, which are reaffirmed by this important agreement.&quot;                                     JAPAN.     Prince  Arthur s  Mission.- Sir  C. Greene reports  the termination of  Prince. ArthuNs  mission to Japan (see Report No. 74). The cordiality  and hospitality  of the Japanese  have been most marked ;  Avhile the  Prince  is unanimously  felt  to have achieved a wonderful personal  success.  Baron Heitaro  Fujita, of Osaka, has handed Prince Arthur  the  sum of 100,000 yen  for the British Red Cross,  as a mark of his affection for England.     Question of  Intervention in Siberia. Sir C. Greene reports that the question  of intervention in Siberia  has again become a matter of principal interest, and is being- discussed by the Foreign Affairs Advisory  Council, and possibly also by a Conference of the Elder Statesmen.  The Military party,  a large proportion of the  House  of Peers, and certain  prominent newspapers are in favour of action.  The Mercantile community is still inclined, to hold hack.   The Seiyukai and Kenseikai parties in the Lower House question  whether the  moment is ripe.   There  does  not  appear to be  a spontaneous national enthusiasm for the movement.     Statutory  Fist  Policy. Lord Reading  reports that  the Japanese  Government, following  upon  a  suggestion made last  April by  the  United  States  War Trade Intelligence  Department, has now formally expressed its desire to co-operate with the other Allies  in  the  application of the Statutory List Policy.  This  would  seem  to involve the  participation of a Japanese Representative in  tlie relative  Inter-Allied Conferences at London, Paris and Washington ;  probably also a conference at TJokio regarding lists  for  China and possibly Siam.   The  United States  Government  is supporting the principle of Japanese  co-operation,  and the consent of His Majesty&apos;s; Government is requested.                                   PANAMA.     Withdrawal of  United States Forces. Sir  0. Mallet reports  that on July 10th the  military police  forces landed by the United States  Government [sec  Reports Nos. 75 and 76) were withdrawn, and that municipal  control of Colon  and  Panama, was resumed by the Panama Government.                                   PORTUGAL.     Portugal and the Vatican.- Sir L. Carnegie reports that the decree re-establishing relations  between Portugal and the Vatican (see Report No. 76) was published  in Lisbon under date of July 9th.  According to the Portuguese Press,  the Portuguese representative at the Vatican will be Captain Filicino D&apos;Costa, formerly Minister of Labour.     Intrigues in the Azores. The Foreign  Office learns of an intrigue to replace the- present  High Commissioner  in  the  Azores  by  a  representative  of  pro-German. sympathies.    Sir  L.  Carnegie  has  been instructed to approach  the Portuguese Government in the matter.                               UNITED  STATES.      Alleged Boloism.-A message from Newr York (July 8th) states that Dr. Edward A. Rumely, Vice-President and Treasurer of the Company publishing the New Yorli- Evening Mail, was arrested (July 8th) at  the offices of the paper.  Attorney-General
Lewis, of New York State, charged him with  perjury in reporting  the ownership ofthe paper to the Alien Property Custodian.  Attorney-General Lewis in the complaintcharges Dr. Rumely with having acted on behalf of the Imperial German government when he purchased the stock of the Evening Mail  in  June 1917.  lie alleges that dr. Rumely in.  reporting the  transaction failed to disclose  his relations with Countvon Bernstorff and Dr. Heinrich  Albert, the. former  Commercial Attache  to  theGerman  Embassy.   The complaint declares that  the  German Government paid.Dr. Rumely SI,361,000 in several transactions connected  with the purchase.     Proposed Visit  of Congressmen. The Foreign  Office learns  that  a  party ofCongressmen  proposes to visit  Europe  to  study  various matters connected withthe Avar.ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNG ARY.     Austrian Government. According to information received by the Foreign -Office,it is generally thought in Austria that the Prime Minister cannot remain much longer in office.  There  is some  talk of his being succeeded  by  Bilinski, who has a specialknowledge of finance.  Baron Burian  is very unpopular,  and it  is possible  that count Czernin may again become Foreign Minister.   The Polish  Club  is likely to bargain  with the Austrian  Government for  a guarantee against  the  partition ofGalicia.   Should  it support the Government, a revolution in Galicia would probablyresult.  Poles and Czechs  are  in close co-operation,  and  it is unlikely that theGovernment  wdll  be successful  in  forming  a majority  of  Germans  and Polescombined.  A report  of Dr. von SeidleFs speech at the reassembling of  the lower house is given in The Times of July 1.8th at page 5.     Conditions in Austria. The situation in  Vienna is  reported as  follows to theBerliner Tageblatt by its Vienna  correspondent : The daily rations per head havebeen fixed at approximately three ounces of  bread  and  flour substitutes, one ounce of meat, not quite one quarter  of an ounce  of fat, 2If ounces  of potatoes, three-quarters of an  ounce  of jam, and a quarter of an ounce of war coffee, making a  total  dailyallowance of  7-f- ounces.  Those  desirous  of supplementing these rations must resort to secret channels, paying exorbitant prices.  Real coffee costs 11. 17s. 9d. per pound.Flour  has been officially  fixed at 7d. per pound, and the  better qualities at Is. perpound, but it can only be  obtained secretly at  18s.  to 20s. per pound.  Meat on rationtickets is fixed at 6s.  8tZ. to 10s. per pound, while  for unrationed meat 23s. to 35s. is charged.  The price  for horse-flesh is  14s. per pound, and for geese 30s. per pound.At the middle-class restaurants meals cost  .12s. 6d.  The  lack of foodstuffs involveshardships which  tend to  weaken Ausiria&apos;s power of resistance, so that some  adjust-ment had to be  made, and was  made in  the course of the negotiations betweenVienna, Budapest, and Berlin.   Describing the unsound social conditions  in Vienna,the correspondent says that theatres, jewellery shops,  art and book dealers  are havingunparalleled  turnovers.   War-workers bet largely at the race meetings.  They fill thebest places at the theatres and spend lavishly at the wine  bars, which are also muchfrequented by soldiers&apos; wdves and youths.  Owing to excesses, these bars are closedat 9 o&apos;clock  in the evening  on  weekdays and at noon  on  Sundays.   In the  streets,however,  the children  beg  for bread, and  in the Vienna  woods  poor  women arealready now gathering wood for  the winter, because  a sufficient  coal supply  can hardly be counted upon.   According to a report received by the Foreign Office, neitherthe population of Austria  nor the troops at the front will obtain fresh flour before themiddle of August.  The greatest confusion reigns in the country. The people argue thatthe real losses on  the, Piave  must have been much  in excess of the  100,000 admitted by  the Hungarian Premier.  Though  there  may not  actually  be a revolution, acomplete collapse may occur at any moment, in which the administration would forall. practical purposes  cease to exist.     Austrian Jews and  the Entente. According  to  the  Jewish  CorrespondenceBureau at The Hague, the Lemberger Tageblatt says: &quot;The  difference in the attitudeof the two belligerent groups is becoming more and more definite.  We are now facedfey the fact that the Entente is doing  ever more for us,  wdiile  the Central  Powers     6073-3b                            B
promise  us ever less.  Were we  to  compile a record of  our Governments trans-gressions, the Censor would  leave only white spaces.  We Austrian  Jews are thusled more and more into the temptation to abandon our neutrality,  and, in conflict with our duties as citizens of the State, to choose the side which supports our Jewishinterests.&quot;     Czeclw-Slovak  Aims.-The Vienna newspapers report from  Prague that  theinaugural sitting of the Czech  National Committee was held  on July 13th, and that dr. Ivramarzh was  elected President.   The  National Committee resolved to issue anappeal to  the Czecho-Slovak people containing the following : &quot;The Czecho-Slovakpeople&apos;s  task consists in working for the attainment of the right of  self-determination and for an autonomous democratic Czecho-Slovak State, with its own administration,in its own house, under its own sovereignty.&quot;     Exchange. In connection with  the  recent  extensive  purchases  of gold andBritish and  American  bank notes in neutral countries (see Reports  Nos. GO, 62-65,67 and  70 under  &quot;Netherlands,&quot; &quot;Norway,&quot; or &quot;Switzerland&quot;)  a report  receivedexplains this as due to  the  small confidence felt in the bank notes  of the  CentralPowers.   For the  purpose of purchases in  the  East, the  buying power  of Austriannotes is said to have fallen to about a fifth of the gold value, and of English paper.     Conditions  in  Hungary. The Foreign Office learns  that there have lately beenvery numerous desertions from the Hungarian  Army ; also that the  Government, inorder to suppress unfavourable news, connived at the recent strike  of printers, sothat the issue  of  newspapers  was rendered impossible.   The Hungarians  cannot expect new  flour  before August.  The Germans have  refused  the  request of  the hungarian Government  for  the recall of  German -officers and  men  from Hungary(see  Report No.  75), contending that  they  must remain there for the duration of  the war for the purpose of maintaining contact with  German forces  in  Turkey and bulgaria.                                  GERMANY.    Direction of Foreign Policy. -In the Reichstag  Main Committee on July 11th,Count Herding declared  that the  resignation of von Ivuhlmarm (see Report  No. 76)Avas due not to  essential, but to personal reasons.   Count Herding warmly  praisedthe late Foreign S3cretary&apos;s abilities, and said he had had to part with him  becausethe necessary confidence  had not  existed betAveen the Foreign  Secretary and other elements.  The  Imperial Chancellor concluded : &quot; The name of the  man who hasbeen  proposed, as  Herr  von Kiihlmann&apos;s successor  is known to you.   Von  Hintzepossesses a  thorough knowledge of  Russian  affairs,  Avhich  is a  matter of  greatimportance in the present situation.  But it goes -without saying that I will only givemy counter-signature or signature  to the appointment of Herr von Hintze on condition that Herr von Hintze follows my line of policy and not his own.  HoAvever,  as far asI  am  concerned,.! already  have a sure guarantee for  this in Herr von Hintze&apos;spromise.  I will direct the line of  policy ; the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairshas merely to carry out  my  policy.   The proposed Secretary of  State  is absolutelyclear on this point.  The  course with which  the great majority  of the Reichstagdeclared itself to be in agreement in November of last year will still be followed.&quot;     According to information received by the Foreign Office, Count Hertling resignedsimultaneously  with the Foreign Secretary, but his resignation,- though not with-draAvn, Avas  not accepted.   (Solf and Ball in are  stated to be competing to  succeedhim.)  The motive of von Kithlmann in  resigning Avas his conviction of the necessitythat  the Military.Party should  experience  a defeat.  He believes that  he will againtake  office in less than a year.  Another  report  states  that  the retirement of  vonKuhlmann is attributed  in. Austrian circles  to the decision of  the Military Party thathe was not sufficiently firm in  his attitude  towards Austria.  The report of  Admiralvon  Hintze&apos;s appoiutmeul  in  succession  to Herr von Kuhhnann  is  hailed  by thePheinisch-Westfdlische Zeitvng (July 10th), which praises  the  new mini steps gift ofstatesmanship, his diplomatic  skill, and, above all, his energy.  The paper expressesthe hope that a fresh sea-breeze will  now  IjIoav  through the Wilhelmstrasse.  TheKreuz (July 9th) writes : &quot; kuhlmann was too much of an internationalist, incapable of conducting a strong policy on a national basis, and he never learned to think like a German.   We must wait and see Avhether Hintze will be able to give the requisitefirm  note to  our foreign  policy.&quot;   The Kolnische Volkszeitung (July 10th) hopes thatKuhlmann-s  successor  will  be a good German  Avho knoAvs what he Avants  andhas  some authority,  so  that  the enemy  will respect  him even  if  they   do  not like him.  &quot; The new Secretary considers England  the main enemy, and ad\meated
ruthless  submarine  warfare when  Bethmann hesitated.&quot;  Dr. Ludwig Idaas, writing-in the  Berliner  Tageblatt of  July  ldth,  reports that  the impression  likely tobe made by the appointment of  Von Hintze will not be one such  as will strengthen the  desire  for peace  among the peoples of  the Entente.   He  considers that itwill  be  unbearable  in the long  run  that a  State  Secretary is  to  be considered as incapable  if  he  loses  the  confidence of  the Supreme  Army  Command.   Atpresent it is not sufficient to  enjoy the confidence of the Imperial Chancellor.  TheSupreme  Command  must  also approve.  The whole Government must resign if itcannot enforce the policy of the Reichstag  majority.  Kuhhnann was in agreementAvith the Reichstag majority and the Government,  and  seemingly resigned because ofthe  opposition of the military  authorities.  If this is true,  the  continuance  of  asham  Government  can  only discredit parliamentary  Government  in  Germany.KiihlmaniTs discharge will be  taken  by the enemy as  a sign that Germany doesnot Avant the peace recently described  by him.   This  would!  be a difficult obstacle to peace,  which  the Government  can  only remove  by  declaring before  theReichstag  that despite  all it will  carry  on  and enforce a  straightforward  and reasonable  policy  of   accommodation.  But  avc  are   not  optimistic  on  thispoint after the experience of the past few weeks  .  -.  .   .   The full responsibilityfor the present serious crisis falls  on Ifertling, whose position is obscure and avIio-has  every reason to clear matters  up.    It  wdll  not  help much  to  insist thatthe  Emperor  has a  right  to appoint and. dismiss Ministers, for this evades themost important  question  of accommodation  Avith the  Reichstag  AAdiich cannot  belightly  disregarded  by those who have  any sense of responsibility. . . . It  is  noquestion of a few dozen votes in Parliament, but of the feeling of millions of Germanswho consider themselves affected.   We cannot have  a party of millions  like  theSocialists  driven  into opposition,  for that   would necessarily have  consequencesseriously impairing the will to hold out, and the continuance of  the  war itself.  TheMilnchner  Neueste Nachriehten says: &quot;In  any other  country  except Siam  and abyssinia, a  Minister must go when  he no longer enjoys  the  confidence of  themajority in the Parliament.  In the German Empire a Secretary of State is dismissedAvhon the  minority demands it.   Over the question of  what  ma)7  be expected ofKtlhlmann&apos;s successor, opinions differ;  if  it is true, as  reported, that he will continueKuhhnamfs policy, then Avhy was  a  change necessary?   But if he  pursues anotherpolic)7, the attitude  of the Chancellor, who  is responsible,  must soon be shown.&quot;Liberal and Socialist  criticism  is  learning to  adopt  the thought expressed in theReichstag  by Haase on. June  25th: &quot;Among  us the  military party rules.   CountHertling, Herr a-ou  Kuhhnann,  and  Dr.  von Payer are  only fig leaves  so that themilitary party should not appear stark naked.   Why are not things made fully clear and  the  man who  really rules Germany  put in  the Chancellors  place, namely,General  Ludendorlf.   The Vienna Arbeiter Zeitung writes : &quot; All the world  willregard the fall of Kuhlmann  as  a complete victory for Prussian militarism, and seethat the victory of the Generals  extinguishes  the  last ray of  hope of the  possibilityof a  speedy peace.  Austria-Hungary cannot keep  silent over happenings in Germanynow that  the anncxationist&apos; party has . gained  such indisputable power.  It  mustbe clearly ascertained whether  Berlin and Vienna are  still  agreed  over  aims andthe continuance of the Avar.  We need negotiations with German)7, but not regarding a  deepening and extension of the Alliance, not  regarding the Polish question, butchiefly regarding the aims we are fighting for and  on what terms the war may  finallyend.  The German Army Command alone cannot  dictate to us for Avhat and for how long we  must fight.&quot;  It is significant that the Centre Party has  decided to stanch bythe  Reichstag Majority.   This  decision,  as the  Frankfurter Zeitung  of July 9thpoints out, has caused great disappointment on the Right, AAdiich hoped to be able tobreak up  the Majority  and replace  it by  one of its own,  so as to exert political influence on  the  Imperial Parliament  such as the Agrarian Industrialist Majority    Peace  Campaign. -According  to  a  report received  by  the  Foreign  Office,Germany  is about  to  offer,  in  connection  with the present offensive,  peace termsspecially advantageous to France,  These would not, however, include the  cession of alsace.   It is said that a neutral pacifist, avIio  has for some time been endeavouringunsuccessfully  to promote  peace conversations in Switzerland,  now intends  tocircularise prominent men in neutral countries with the object of indirectly incitingBritish pacifists to compel the British Government  to permit  their participation insuch conA7ersations, on  the footing that peace must  be brought about  by a league ofnations, rather  than a league of  nations by peace.   This moA7ement would  appear tobe  due to German inspiration.   The German  High Command  is stated to consider
Austria incapable of any  important further  effort, and  lo  regard it  as  almost inGermany&apos;s interests that Austria should make a separate xoeace as this  would relieve-Germauy of a great burden, economic and otherwise, and permit of the importationinto Germany, through Austria, of supplies from the outside world.     War Credit.-German  Wireless of July 13th  states : &quot; The  supplementaryBudget regarding the war credit of  fifteen milliard marks has been accepted by  theMain Committee.  The Independent Socialists voted against the credit,  and the PolishMembers refrained from  voting at all.&quot;     Food Conditions. According  to Vorwarts,  Wels (Soc.  Maj.)  speaking  in  theReichstag   on   July 6th, &apos; said, amidst  loud  Socialist  applause : &quot; Any further-deterioration in the food supply is unbearable.  Certain circles  have no idea  of  themisery prevailing amongst the masses.  The KaiseFs speech  at Aix-la-Chapelle onthe  alleged  supplies from the Ukraine  showed how  badly the Kaiser is informedregarding the real position.  It is quite  impossible for the workers to get adequatefood with the present wages.   War bonuses, to counteract the increased cost of living,amount on an average to not more than 30 per cent, of such increase.  According to-sick  club statistics, 47 per cent, of  the Berlin workers earn under  four marks daily.Unemployment  is now  increasing in Berlin.  If  this development continues eventslike those of January  last must  necessarily recur.  Furthermore, we  must  face  thedanger of a possible gap in the bread supply before  the  new  harvest.   Every claythat the war is prolonged means months  of delay  before the people will be able to get an adequate food supply again.  Any shortening  of the war, therefore, is a greatereconomic gain than the conquest of a province.&quot;     Germany and the Ukraine. The Berlin correspondent of Stocl;liolm&apos;s Dagblad hasbeen informed  by the  Ukrainian Hetman  Skoropadsky that though  the  Ukraine isgradually being pacified by German help, it is at present impossible to hold elections..With  regard to cereals, the Hetman stated that he could  hold  out  no prospects ofsupplies to neutrals.-     Shipping  and  Shipbuilding, -The  Daily   Review  (E.P.S.)   of  July  11threports : The  Nordisciies  Kolonialkontor  G.m.b.B.  in  Hamburg  has publishedDie deutsche Seeschiffahrt  vor, in  und nach dcm  Kriege (Germany&apos;s shipping before,during and after the War),  which  contains  valuable statistical  material.  Accordingto this book the German mercantile fleet in  January 1914 comprised 5,459,296 gross registered   tonnage.  Up   to  the  present  the   various  German  lines  have  lostapproximately   800  ships,  of  about t.2,900,000  gross, through direct and  indirectcauses.  That is more than 50 per cent, of Germany&apos;s  mercantile fleet.  If  all shipslying in neutral ports at present should be  considered  as lost,, too, then  about two-thirds of the whole original fleet can be regarded as lost.  In view of these losses it isvery interesting to see what new ships have been  built to order of the  shipping companies since the war.  The company reports about these as follows  :      Of the  large  shipping companies, the  Hamburg-America has the Bismarck, oft.56,000,  the Tirpilz,  of  t.32,000, and  three others  of t.22,000  each in course of construction in  the Hamburg shipyards.   In Bremen nine steamers are being built,of which four of 1.18,000 each will be the largest  cargo steamers in the  world.  Atthe   Flensburger yards there  are  three large  passenger  and cargo ships  under construction and two steamers of t.13,000 each are on  order.  Near Tecklenborg,  inGeestemunde, two cargo steamers of 1.17,000 each are being built.  The Bam burg-- South American S.S. Co. has, besides the Cap. Polonio, an improved sister-ship to  thelost Cap. Trafalgar (t.18,000), four other cargo steamers being built at various yards..The Norddeutsche  Lloyd  is  building  in  Danzig two liners,  the  Columbus andHindenburg, each t.35,000 ;  further, the  Munchen and Zeppelin, each of  1.16,000,. and 12 other steamers of 1.12,000  each.  The Afrika-Linie  has  six, the Hansa-linie .1.2,  and the Kosmos-Linie  10 steamers laid down, all of t.9,000 to t.13,000.  Thus-the principal shipping concerns are adding a total of  about t.950,000 to the&apos; German mercantile  fleet.   But  this tonnage is  not  enough  to replace the losses.   It has,therefore,  been  deemed necessary  to introduce  State intervention in the German shipbuilding trade.   And the direct result of this is the law relating to  the rebuilding-of  the mercantile fleet  which  the  Reichstag recently passed.   The  pamphlet also contains the following passage : &quot;It was lucky  for the German shipping companies that the war broke  out  after the prosperous  economic years of 1911-1913,  during;which they made such big profits and were able to form large reserves.  If it  hadbeen  otherwise, then these concerns could not have  held out during the war.&quot;  Asmall proportion of  the German  shipping firms -have been able  to  continue theirsailings in the North Sea and the Baltic during the war, and a considerable number-
of cargo steamers have been employed by the German Navy.   But the majority ofthe German mercantile fleet has not only been lying idle, but has  suffered  the loss ofmany steamers.  The shipping companies besides have had  very heavy expenses in maintaining their  ships and  crews in neutral  harbours, where they have  been idlesince the war broke out.  It is, therefore, not to be wondered  at that in consequenceof all these losses a number of shipping concerns are  now in a precarious  position,their reserve capital being exhausted.

German Activities......Further  reports received (see also  Report No. 76) mention the  strenuous activities of  the Germans in the Argentine.&quot;  The  nickel coinage haspractically disappeared, and it is commonly believed  that  the Germans are hoardingit or transporting it to Germany via Spain.                                     CHILE.     Nitrates and Neutrality. Information received by the Foreign Office indicates thatChile is determined to preserve neutrality, both for economic reasons and because sheis anxious not to commit herself while the issue of the war is undecided.   Thus, theChamber of Deputies has disapproved the proposed charter of three German steamers,transfer  of  whose  flags  the United  States  was prepared  to recognise conditionally(inter alia) on the carriage of nitrates to the United States.  The country is benefitingby the high prices  paid  by  the Allies for nitrates, and there is a general assumptionthat tonnage other than the interned vessels will  be forthcoming  to lift them.   Noris there much uneasiness  that  the  demand will be affected in the near future by theconstruction of plants in other countries.  Assurances have been given by Berlin thatGermany will make extensive purchases after the war.  While, therefore, it is unlikelythat Chile can he  induced to acquire the  enemy ships at  the  possible risk of her neutrality, she  may nevertheless  see the advantage of  at once  concluding a longnitrate contract with the Allies.                                    DENMARK.     German Violation of Danish Neutrality. The  Danish  Press  reports  that onJuly  10th  the Zeppelin L60  passed over  Tjaerborg,  flying  at  a  low  altitude.Apparently no attempt was made by Danish forces to  fire at it.     New Scandinavian Co-operative Union. A  reliable  source reports that  arrange-nients have  been completed  for  economic  co-operation  between the  Co-operativeCentral Organisations in the Scandinavian countries.   The interested  parties possesstogether a capital of about 4-0 million kroner.  Through a common purchasing centre,the organisation will  buy colonial products  direct  from places of production, andintends  gradually  to extend  the  class of  goods.  Future plans  include purchase ofplantations, which will be run by the organisation itself, and also of ships to bringthe  produce home.   Director L.  Broberg, of the FaeJlesforeninger  for  DamnarksBrugsforeninger (&quot; Joint  Union for Denmarks  Supply Associations &quot;), states  that the norwegians  with their &quot; Landsorganisation,&quot; corresponding  to  the  Danish  SupplyAssociations,  and  the Swedes with their  similar organisation,  called the  SvenskKooperativt Forbund (&quot; the Swedish Co-operative Union &quot;) will join in the scheme, andit is expected  that  Finland  too will, participate..   Negotiations  for  co-operationbetween members of the Association of the four countries  have already taken place,when a committee was appointed under the  chairmanship of Director  Broberg.  andthe  Swedish  Director, Alb in  Johanson, as  secretary.   Articles  of  association  were drawn up at the Conference, which are to be confirmed at the next meeting to  takeplace in Christiania in August.   Copenhagen will probably  be voted the purchasing-centre.   The  total annual  turnover  of the four associations  amounts  to  about200 million kroner.   (See also Report No. 76.)                                    FINLAND.     Finland and the North. The  Finnish  government  has, through the  Swedish-Government, expressed anxiety lest Finland might be involved in a conflict  between     60; 3-3b                              C
Allied troops and German or Russian forces.  Sir E. Howard has  replied that theAllies  have no intention  of attacking Finland, unless first  attacked  by her in con-junction with the Germans.   The Foreign Office instructs Sir E. Howard to add that,should Finland  be permitted by  the Finnish Government to  became a  base formilitaiy  operations by  the  Germans, this would be an xmneutral act and  would  befollowed by unpleasant  consequences.  Svenska Dagbladet  of July  13th reports thatin a speech  delivered at- a  meeting in Viborg the Finnish Senator  Setala declaredthat the present  Eastern boundary  of Finland  was strategically impossible, whereaswith  the  incorporation of Russian Karelia, sea, lakes and  marshes  would  make  an excellent frontier.   Both from a  defence and economic point of view the  incorporation of  Russian Karelia was essential.   President  Svinhufvud then  made  a  speechexpressing agreement with this attitude and  added that  the question of a greater-Finland should unite all Finnish people. A German Wireless message (July 11th)states : &quot; The Finnish  Government ....  through the  German  Government hassignified to the Russian &quot;Government that it desires  to start peace negotiations andthe Russian Government has agreed.&quot;     Germany and Finnish Independence. German Wireless of July 12th reports : &quot; General Field Marshal von Hindenburg has been  awarded  the Grand Cross of theFinnish. Cross of  Liberty by the Chief Administrator of  the country.  The field marshal, in his telegram in reply, referred to the liberty and independence regained,and expressed the hope  that the  friendship of Finland for  the German Empire might lead to greater  prosperity.&quot;  A report  received  indicates  that public  feeling  in finland, particularly among the  more educated  classes, is rapidly turning against theGermans.   It is stated that the Swedish party would be opposed  to  any mobilisationagainst Russia or Great Britain.  The difficulty is  that the Germans have  obtained a very strong grip on the  country ;  for  instance, they would not allow  the  Finns  toaccept an Allied offer of food,  but compelled the export of  rubber, metals, coffee and tobacco to  Germany in return for a modicum of grain (see Reports Nos. 57-61, 63, 68,.and 72).   Food prospects are serious ;  there is practically no hay; and.  the crops are inbad condition.     Finnish Constitution. The  Swedish papers of July 16th reproduce a statement.from  the  Finnish News Bureau that  the Finnish  Landtag  has passed the  secondreading of the Monarchical Constitution Bill by a  majority of  four.  ITe followingamendment was adopted : &quot; The King comes of age at 21 years.  He may not begina war of aggression without the consent of  the Riksdag.&quot;  The Stockholm Dagblatstates  that the real tussle in this question is  expected on the third reading,  when the republicans will probably put forward proposals for a referendum.   Dagens Nyhetersays the majority is so small that the&quot; question  can  hardly be settled this year.  Thefive-sevenths majority necessary to declare  the  question  urgent  can probably  besecured,  but, when  a definite   resolve  is  to  be   taken,  the Monarchists  will  not obtain the two-thirds majority requisite,  and  the question will have to be deferredtill after  the elections.   These, it  is  almost  certain, will  give a  majority to  the republicans, unless all social democratic campaign is prevented by  force.   (And see-Reports Nos. 67-73.)     The Language Question. The Foreign Office learns that a compromise amendmentproposed  by the  Old Finnish Party  regarding the language question (see reports nos. 72 and 75) has been accepted by the Landtag.   The terms of this compromise arenot satisfactory to the Swedish Party,  which has entered a protest.  (Aa^a^l&amp;ppoflte.     Finnish Navy.-The Foreign Office learns that the Finns  have salved a  numberof Russian small war vessels and are organising a Finnish Navy.   (And  see  ReportNo.  72.)  Although  Swedish is spoken by  the majority of  the sailors, the authoritieshave ordered  that  the  language of the Navy is to be Finnish.  (And see preceding.paragraph.)     Finnish-Military Budget. The Finnish News Bureau announces (July 16th) thatthe Finnish Landtag has voted a grant of 120 million marks for military requirements for the second half of the current year.     German Employment of Finnish Bed Prisoners. The  Foreign Office  learns that18,000 Finnish Red prisoners are being sent to Germany to work  in the mines, thus-freeing a similar number of  Germans for  active  service.   (And see Reports Nos.  67and  08.)     Arrest by Germans of  Allied Subjects in Aland. With reference to the  arrest ofAllied subjects by the Germans in the Aland Islands (sec beports Nos. 60, 62 and.
63),  the Finnish Charge cl&apos;Affaires in Stockholm has  informed Sir E. Howard thatnumerous representatimDS have been made by the Finnish Government to the GermanGovernment, but that  the latter will only agree to  release the women and children.The  release  of  males  is  conditional upon exchange of German subjects arrested on neutral vessels or territory.     Finland  and the  Jews. According  to a Stockholm  message of July  9th, theJewish Press Bureau in Stockholm  reports that the  Jews of  Finland have issued anappeal to the civilised  world for  assistance.   The  Finnish Senate has decided to regard the Landtag&apos;s  Emancipation Act as conferring a right individually to apply for naturalisation, which will  be granted  to the few  Jews who fought in the  ranks ofthe White Guards. The Government has ordered, all Jews  to be  expelled, before september 30th, and has instructed local  committees to refuse  them food after this date.     General ftlannerheim and  the Allies. The Foreign Office  is informed that GeneralManuerheim  has intimated to  the Finnish  Government his readiness to visit london or Paris with a view to establishing better relations between Finland and the Allies.                                    MEXICO.    Position of the Carranza Government. Lord Beading reports an American viewof the Carranza Administration.   This view endorses and supplements that expressedby Mr. Thurstan (see Report  No. 76).  Mere recognition of Carranza by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not  keep  him in  power, and.  would be interpreted  by Mexicansand the German element in Mexico as a sign of weakness.  Recognition coupled witha loan would seem to be an unwarrantable  reversal of  policy.   At this  moment theSpanish, Italian and. Belgian Ministers are stated,  to be suggesting their  own with-drawai.  describing their  position as useless  and undignified.   The maintenance  of order in Mexico is claimed as the task of the United States  Government.   Carranzacould not be  successfully displaced by  any Mexican movement which  had not thesupport of the United States, though he would fail at once if such support were given ;and the United States Government might  well be persuaded  to give  it  if anarchyappeared to be imminent.    German Cultural  and Economic Propaganda. German Wireless  of  July 16threports : &quot; Amidst  lively participation of the leading circles, the inauguration tookplace in Munich of the Germano-Mexican Society  for the  cultivation of culture andeconomic relations with Mexico,  and the promotion of  the mutual relations  by meansof the publication of  the periodical The Mexican Review.   The greatest possiblefacilities for study  by young Mexicans at the German  High  Schools  wdll alsQ bestriven for.&quot;                                NETHERLANDS.    Elections and Government. Detailed results  of the Dutch General  Election (seeReport No. 76) are reported as  follows   The Right obtains a  solid  bloc of 50  seats in the  Chamber of 100  members.   The bloc is  composed  of Roman  Catholics 30,Anti-Revolutionaries  13,  Historical  Christians 7.   The  Left  has  37 seats :   OldLiberals,  Liberal  Unionists,  and  Free Democrats  15,  Socialists  22.    There are13 members whose politics are  uncertain, who belong  to seven or eight now groups.A  Press message  of  July  13th  states that  Queen  Wilhelmina  has  chargedMgr.  William Hubert  Nolens,  a Catholic  member of the Second Chamber of theStates General, with the formation of  a  Ministry.   The Dutch  Press  points out  thatthis does not mean, that he wdll necessarily succeed.   The Catholic  Maasbode, whileexpressing  the highest  satisfaction with the  offer, says that most probably politicalcircumstances  will  lead to a  Cabinet  of the Right being  formed by a leading-personality from another  of the parties of  the Right.   The Foreign Office  has reasonto believe that the Anti-revolutionary  party  is opposing  a  Clerical administration..Sir W.  Townley  learns  that   the  Premiership  wdll  probably be  undertaken  byMr. Van Idenburg,  formerly Governor-General of the Dutch  East Indies, and  thatthe present Netherlands Minister to the  Vatican is likely  to  become  Minister  forForeign Affairs, though it is possible that Mr.  Colijn may be appointed.     Troelstra and Dutch Neutrality. The  refusal by  the  British Government ofpassports to Troelstra, leader  of the  Dutch  Socialist  Party, to attend the  Annual
Labour Conference as a  fraternal  delegate, has been much commented  on and  hasprovoked a  speech  in explanation  of  his  foreign  policy  from  Troelstra.  the speech was  made before -&apos; a party  meeting  at  Amsterdam.   After  a  reference  tothe  Labour  Conference and  to  the  refusal of  passports,  Mr.  Troelstra  turned to the question  of  international  politics :--&quot; The  workers stand in need  of clearinformation  on  the  international  position.  The war was the  fiasco of  bourgeoispolitics.   That is why  the  question  of the actual responsibility  for the  outbreakof the war  is  of relatively small importance.  The great question  for Socialistsis :  how  is  it  possible to make  an  end.  of  the methods  of  imperialism ?  Amilitary   victory  in  this  war,  to  whichever  side  it  fell,  would be a  victory.for militarism, for imperialism.   From the beginning of the  war  I  have taken upthe  standpoint   that  our  military  force must  not at  the  end  of  the  war  beused to turn the  scale  in favour of either party,  but  that the  war must have anindecisive conclusion with neither victor nor vanquished.   Our neutrality is  to keepout  of the  war  and pray  for  the bankruptcy of  the  war.  It  is  our only  wayof becoming  an  intermediary,  of  working for a negotiated   peace,  a peace  asmuch  as possible under  the  influence  of.  the Socialist international.....Our geographical position pledges us  to absolute neutrality.   We are forced by it tohave a number of economic ties with Germany.   We can never protect our frontiersagainst our powerful  military neighbour.  If  we do  not want  to fall into Germany&apos;power, we must take care to give Germany no  excuse.   We  should give Germanyevery opportunity to intervene if for the sake of our  colonies we pursued  an Entento-phil policy.  In that case, Germany would force a military convention on us in orderto secure our harbours against the Entente in her own interests.  The threat  to  ourindependence comes  from the German side.  It is just because I am  a friend  ofpeace, a  democrat, a Socialist, just because all that  is best in our people is opposedto the  KaiseFs German spirit, that I oppose a pro-Entente  policy that would lead usin the end  into Germany&apos;s arms.  It  is only the  Socialist International  that canprotect the small nations in their independence.  What if we were invaded ?   I have said before  that, in case of conflicts, our Government  must consider what can beasked  of the military power we possess without making impossible demands on it,and  sending it  into  a  hopeless  struggle.  What  can we ask of our  men on  the frontiers?.  Everybody knows how difficult it is  in  these times  to  get the materials for properly equipping our artillery.   Certainly we do not  lack means of resistance,but  I  wdll never  be. a  party to  sending  our young men  to  the slaughter withoutreckoning with  their military possibilities.  Neutrality  is our watchword.  I havenever criticised  the Government so long as it adhered strictly to neutrality.   In theshipping question I was moderately critical because I foresaw that the Centrals wouldalso  demand an act  of  benevolent  neutrality from  us.   I have  always tried to  seeobjectively so far  as  that is  possible  in these times. We are sailing among rocks,and  I could  only be reproached if I had made no attempt to find the way out.   I  did.what I could,  but now, as  at  Stockholm,  it is the  people who abuse us who workagainst the  peace movement.  We  must, have the League of Nations, the restorationof the International.  That  is why I  rejoice to see that the  Entente Socialists  arenow inclined to negotiate.   It is for you to vote for the party that opposes Dutchimperialism.....   Support the party that will not  permit the  army to be  ledautomatically to the slaughter ! &quot;     In the course of  a reply, the  Telegraaf of June 27th observes : &quot; Mr. Troelstrasaid that, in. the event of an attack, wre must consider whether  resistance would behopeless, This will be noted in the  Entente countries, and will awaken a legitimatedoubt  as to whether we  are prepared to defend our neutrality.   Why did Mr. Troelstranot draw the conclusion and  call for  demobilisation ? First, he roused distrust by the stockholm adventure;   then he thought  it necessary to confer with Scheideinannbefore going to the  British Labour Congress.  He  tells us that w^e  must patientlyendure submarine murders, and now comes the climax :  he, the responsible statesman,tells us that we  must consider well before we defend our neutrality with arms againstGermany.  Then in a peroration he  calls for&apos;the votes of  his audience if they  do  not desire to further  imperialism  and  militarism.   Mr.  Troelstra  has  confirmed  theopinion that he Avas playing Germany&apos;s cards.  He has also given the Entente good reason to believe that, if he comes to power, it is all  up  with the  maintenance of  ourneutrality.  Mr. Troelstra is  at the moment the greatest danger of war in  the country.ddie Roman  Catholic Maasbode (June  28th), though from different motives, agrees with this conclusion.  It begins by pointing out that the so-called Dutch  imperialistsare  not   the  only  dangerous  party.    There  is   also  the  Greater   Netherlandsgroup,  the  Activists, who  cherish  the idea of a Nederlandia Irredenta and  the
        &quot;;                    .             is ,     : j   \-                    ,-dream  of  recovering  it.   It goes  on then  to  say  that Troelstra  holds a position of  great  responsibility  at  present.    Whatever  the  result of  the  elections,  he will  have  the dominant  position  on. the  Left.   He will be  either  a  member of  the  Government  or  the chief figure  of the  Opposition.   Any  utterances of his. on  international politics have  therefore a peculiar interest, and  he is  bound to exercise caution and  reserve.  His remarks about the  possibilities  of an  attack on Holland must  therefore be  scrutinised with the greatest care.   There is a sinister vagueness about some of his statements, which  cannot - be permitted  in a  responsible leader.. He  must  make a  more  definite  declaration as to whether he shares the universal opinion with regard to the maintenance of our neutrality.  This.has hitherto been the view of all Dutchmen : We do not desire to be drawn into the  war ; we  will do  everything to  avoid war ;  but, if  our territory is  violated or our  independence threatened, we shall be forced, into the struggle.  However tragic  the results, if a foreign army crosses our  frontiers we shall defend ourselves.  We  can do no  other. Mr. Troelstra seems to have enunciated&apos; the view  that neutrality obliges us to mobilise, but not to the armed defence of that  neutrality.  This is an entirely new  conception, and comes dangerously near the Greek ideas which have done that country no service, and have certainly not kept it out&apos;of  the  war.   There  are  many arguments against this view.  First, the chances of war  cannot be calculated  beforehand.  Secondly, if we permit the armed occupation of our country, then  it becomes a  field of  military operations.  For, if we offer no opposition, however hopeless it may appear, then we surrender ourselves at once to the party that appears the strongest.   The same  result is obtained as  though we had defended, ourselves and failed, and we are not spared. the miseries  of war.  The prospect of  war  is  horrible, but still more horrible is the prospect of a war  in which we are completely crushed before  it begins.  Our chief complaint against Mr. Troelstra is that his reasoning increases the chance of war.  It is in the  highest  degree objectionable when a man of influence, who in a few days may  be a Minister, and will certainly be  either the leader of the  Government or of the Opposition party, that is, one of the first men of the country, announces that our mobilisation  does  not mean that  we  should oppose  with  force any attack on our neutrality or independence.  What  impression will Mr. Troelstra&apos;s vague and sinister statements make abroad ?   We imagine that the military parties  of  all the belligerent. cormtries will read  the speech with peculiar interest.   YVe say no  more than that.&quot;     Protests against Violation, of  Dutch Neutrality by  Aircraft. The Netherlands-Government  has made a further protest (and see Reports Nos. 75 and 76) against the violation of Dutch territory by the dropping of  bombs  (alleged to be of British  make) on June 22nd&apos; at  Sin is.  Protests  have been made to Germany and  Great Britain against the appearance of German  and British seaplanes over Dutch territorial waters off Ameland  on dune 30th.   The Government has also protested to Germany against the appearance on July 1st of  a German seaplane over the  harbour of  Oadzand (just over the Belgian frontier at the entrance to the Scheldt estuary).     G or man-Dutch Negotiations. Three important demands are being put forward by the  Germans : (.1) They are trying to induce the Dutch  Government, to undertake to keep the Shipping Requisition Law in force after  the war, in order  that. Germany may be able  to draw on Dutch tonnage, which will be of great assistance to her during the transition period.  This demand has not been complied with ; but the Dutch will probably agree to conclude no  tonnage contracts with countries  hostile to Germany. (2) The latter has also demanded  that  Dutch ships at  present  being  built, or to be built, with German material shall  not be  employed during  the Avar or for three years after the conclusion of peace in the service of  Entente nations.   (3)  An-attempt is also being made by the threat of  withholding shipbuilding material to restrict Dutch  shipoAvners  in the choice   of  routes for  their  steamers.  The  Germans are-anxious to conclude their  agreement  before a definite understanding  is  reached between the Dutch  and the Allies.   In particular they covet  the Dutch leather stocks.

A report received by the Political  Intelligence Department (see  Memorandum  G.T. 5131)  anticipates  that  in the  coming October- election the present  Government will stand, though the Socialists will probably improve  their position.   All  parties are  in  a state  of transition or rather  solution;  and pro- grammes are more  or less in abeyance  till the return of peace.   Peace is the  great demand of the  people generally,  and,  if for no other  reason,  the  Government is     6073-3&amp;                              I)

Press  Campaign regarding  Norwegian-American  Agreement. Sir M.  Findlayreports the resignation of the Minister  of  Industrial Supply as a  result of .the conviction of a prominent member of the Leather Control for illegal export of  hides..ddie Minister has, however, attributed his resignation to insuperable difficulties in the carrying  out  of  the  Norwegian-American Agreement.   (The  Government officialorgan has, however, stated that the Government  does  not  consider these  difficulties.to  lie  insuperable.)   Articles  have appeared in  TIandclsbladet  of July 6th  andMorgenbladet  of July 9th  attributing to Great Britain all delays and difficulties inconnection with the execution of the Agreement.   This campaign, for which there isno  justification, is  calculated to  make  trouble  between  Great  Britain and theUnited States.  The Foreign  Minister has temporarily taken  charge of the vacantMinistry.     German  Safe-condv.ets.-The   German  Charge  d&apos;Affaires  at Ghristiania  hasformally notified the Norwegian Foreign Minister - that the German  Government isprepared to grant safe-conducts to  Norwegian  shipping generally on condition that.the  vessels  are not transferred to  Allied  services and  that  they  are employedexclusively  in  purely Norwegian trade  and do not sail between Allied ports.  TheNorwegian  Government has been  formally invited to send, delegates to Berlin tonegotiate an agreement on these lines.   The Norwegian Foreign Minister states thatthe Norwegian Government is not  in any way committed to these  proposals, and hehas promised to inform  Sir M.  Findlay of  any further developments.

The PeruvianGovernment has made certain  proposals for the purchase by His Majesty:s Government.of native sugar, cotton, &amp;c , to  be  procured by  the Peruvian  Government from the-producers at agreed  rates.   (The Peruvian Government would  be prepared to employinterned German steamers for  the  shipment of goods so purchased : this would seemto be a matter for Inter-Allied  agreement.)

SPAIN.     Espionage Act. In  connection with  the passage of the  Espionage Bill (seeReport, No.  76), a Madrid message  of July 8th states  that  the Minority Parties haveissued, the  following semi-official  note: The Reformists,  Republican  and  SocialistMinorities have met and agreed unanimously : (1) That their attitude at the  sittingof July 6th  was based on the fact that the Anti-Espionage Bill is  contrary to constitu-tioual maxims and organic laws, abusing the governmental majority in order to stifle-the voice of opposition,  thus rendering  the  whole debate  barren ;   (2) that they
persist in their decision not to attend any further sittings in the Chamber, in view ofthe attitude of the Government, which seems determined to disregard the Opposition,only using the forces which are faithful  to it, and so destroying the efficiency of  theparliamentary regime ;  (3) that they propose  outside  the  Chamber to examine  andcriticise all the acts of  the Government by all appropriate  means, registering amongthe people  a lively protest against the violent manner in  which the Government-obtained approval of the Anti-Espionage Bill, although in  practice the measure willharm the nations which represent the cause of civilisation and justice in the war,  andwhich count, and  will always count, on the ardent sympathies of  the  democraticforces which the Minority Parties represent in the Parliament of Spain.     German Wireless of July 11th and 12th refers to disclosures published by La Nae/ionand  La  Tribund,  regarding  Entente   espionage  in  Spain, and  states- that  themachinations of Spanish Ententophils will  be  rendered  more difficult under  thenew law.     German Propaganda. : Neutrality :  Philippines :  Morocco : Catholicism. - german wireless of July 13th states : &quot; With regard to the position of Spain in the world war,the Rumanian Government newspaper Jausl writes :  &apos; Far from allowing herself to becorrupted by the promises or the threats of the nations which have  entered  into the death dance of  war, such  as  was  unfortunately the case  with  Rumania, Spain  has remained neutral in the midst of the European cataclysm.   And the fruits of this wisepolicy have  manifested  themselves  immediately.  To-day the glory of old Spain  has again begun to revive.   To-day the  whole of the Public Debt has been paid, and  the currency in the  Kingdom  of  Alphonse  Xill.  is the golden Napoleon.   To-day thearmy of Spain is untouched and ready to face any foe wdio  may attempt to attack her.And it is not at all out  of the question that at the green table  Spain, in return forher strong neutrality, will demand the restoration of  one of her distant colonies whichat one time  formed her glory, and  which was robbed  from her by  the very nationwhich is fighting in  this world war for  the freedom  of  nations.   How happy you are to-da,y, proud Spain of long ago, and  how other nations  envy you who were not soAvise as you were in the decisive moment.&apos; &quot;     In the Spanish Press of June 30th appears a translation of an article in  the new york Herald, replying  to a supposed  invitation  from  Germany to neutrals to take part  in  the peace  conference.    The  article in question  contains  the following-passage: -&quot;With  all due   respect for  Spain,  which,  according  to  the  .above communication, the Central Empires think of  inviting to preside over the conference,we must make it plain  that this invitation is not authorised by us.&quot;  This expression,of the New York HeraUVs opinion is taken by the pro-German  Press, including theMundo,  -which has  been by no means very sympathetic towards  the Central  Empires of late,  as representing the views of President Wilson.  Germanoxihil journals, suchas Iberia, (July 1st), proceed to quote the article as yet  another  instance of  Wilsonsautocratic  and high-handed  bearing  towards  small  nations,  and  even  the more moderate  Mundo (duly 2nd)  uses language which indicates  that it takes the Germansuggestions seriously.      German Wireless  of July 15th states: &quot; The Berlin newspapers, writing on the subject  of  the  preparations  which Spain is making for the construction of  the Gibraltar tunnel, point out that Spain  is taking steps for the prosecution of  an active policy in Morocco.  In the face of France&apos;s efforts to obtain Tangier and the American schemes of expansion from  the Azores  to north-west Africa,. Spain wishes to demon- strate her historical rights and interests by the construction of the Gibraltar tunnel. Germany will not thwart  Spain!s aspirations in Morocco.   From the beginning of the Avar, Spain has taken no part in  the French  in citation against Germany in Morocco, and in  spite of all the Entente&apos;s  intrigues, has treated German  merchants  in the Spanish zone loyally.&quot;      German Wireless of July. 16th states : &quot;The  Catholic Press  of Germany the August inns Society-in general  meeting, has sent a telegram of greeting to  the Catholics of Spain, and especially  to  the Spanish  Press.    The telegram thanks the Catholic Press of Spain for its dignified  attitude and  its just neutrality and objectivityduring the Avar.&quot;  (And see Reports Nos. 62, 64,  74  and 75.)      German Violation of Spanish  Territorial Waters. Sir A. Hardinge reports  that the case  of the Norwegian  S.S. Tiger, sunk in  Spanish  territorial waters, is to be referred, by agreement between the Spanish  and German Governments, to arbitration by  the King of  Denmark.   The   Spanish  Government  claims  an  indemnity  and demands the punishment of  the  German captain.   Germany suggests that the  case
shall be heard in Berlin before a Spanish, a German and  a Danish delegate, of whomthe last shall be  umpire : Spain  insists  that it shall  be  dealt with at Copenhagen.(And sea under &quot;Norway.&quot;)    Russian Representation  in Spain. -The Foreign Office has represented to theFrench and United States. Governments that,  owing  to lack of funds, the RussianEmbassy and. Consulates in. Spain are in danger of being closed, with the probableresult  that  the  present Russian representatives would, be immediately replaced  by german-subsidised Bolshevists, who,  besides  obtaining possession of the archives,would be able to carry on anti-Ally espionage.                                   SWEDEN.    Sweden, Finland, and the  Aland  Islands. Svenslm Dagbladel  of   July  11thpublishes  a long article  on the  military  and. political  situation of  Sweden, and,although with a side-bow to Germany, states clearly that the Russian  threat throughthe Aland.  Islands,  which, has  been removed by the collapse  of Russia, has nowbeen replaced by a German  threat which is perhaps even more dangerous, owing  toGermany&apos;s  power  in  the  Baltic, and which  will exist  so  long as  the  Alands areFinnish, and Finland is to be more or less considered as  a dependency of, Germany.The importance of the Alands  in any Baltic -warfare, the  journal proceeds, consists in. their many well-protected waters suitable  for the assemblage of a fleet of transports,which could, thence be sent in any direction to the eastern coast of Sweden, and, inthe uncertainty as to whether an attack would be made north or south of  the  narrowwaters  between the Alands and  coast, making adequate  measures of defence verydifficult,  ddie occupation of  the  Aland Islands by a foreign Power must, therefore,always  be  a direct and dangerous threat to a most important portion of Sweden,including the  capital. &quot; The acquisition of  the  Aland  Islands by Sweden,&quot;  thearticle continues, &quot;should be the  first aim-of our foreign policy.  Germany must not find fault with us  if we think first of our own interests, and, consequently, reckon withpossibilities which, however improbable  they may appear, are not outside  the limits of conceivable developments  ; neither must we be blamed if  we still consider theAlands in  the   power  of a  Finland  closely  connected, with  Germany as  an eventual threat  to Sweden, taking   the place of  the  old direct Russian threat,and indicating that Germain7  intends to acquire  a  power  in  the Baltic which willcompletely cut off the other Baltic States from self-determination.  German co-operationtowards our acquiring the Alands-would be a proof. of her  goodwill; and that sheis willing- so -to co-operate would appear from the fact  that Sweden is to be represented,according to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, at the final  decision regarding these islands.Meanwhile Sweden should pursue an unwavering  policy in  this direction.   If asatisfactory solution is to be reached, Finland will, of  course, oppose such  a solution,but arguments in favour of  such a  settlement are  that  the  population,  with theexception of a few immigrants, has been purely  Swedish from all time, and onlyr desiresreunion with Sweden ;  that the Alands have  been saved from  a devastating civil warby Swedish intervention, think what one  may of the Governments  Aland  policy;and that this group of  islands can never have the same  importance  for  Finland as their contiguity to Stockholm gives them  for Sweden.   Russia is crushed to the earthnow, but may recover,  and  then her  demand for  access  to  the ocean would revive.It is not inconceivable  that her influence should again, in one form or other, extend to finland, when Sweden would be  in  the  same  position towards Russia as  before thewar.&quot;  The article concludes : &quot;It is  thus evident that the two foremost objects of swedish foreign policy should be  the strengthening of our position so as to withstandpressure from any Great Power, a rapprochement with our Scandinavian neighbours,ami the acquisition of the Aland Islands.  It were  well if to  these  aims could beadded that of attaining an  understanding with Finland.   The  latter  certainly seems unlikely at- present, and the likelihood will not be  increased,  by our acquiring theAlands.&quot; (Daily  Review of July  15th.)    Paper and Pulp. Sir E. Howard reports that, as a result  of the restriction of exports to  the  Central  Powers  under  the Agreement,   Swedish paper  and  pulpmanufacturers fear that, unless the Allied Governments can take the whole or a large part of their  unexported  balance,  the factories will have  to close down.  the consequent unemployment  would  be  used by  critics of the Agreement as a handleagainst the Swedish  Government,  which  is   therefore   anxious that  the  AlliedGovernments should do wdiat is possible to meet the desire of the manufacturers.
    Swedish-Dutch Trade. The Swedish  papers of July IGth reproduce  a statement in the Dutch Press that the Swedish-Dutch trade cannot be resumed  even if Hollandrescinds the export prohibition for goods to Scandinavia, because Sweden has pledgedherself  in  agreement with the Entente to consign  all  goods to  the  NetherlandsOverseas Trust.  The German Government does not recognise this body and will notgrant safe conducts to vessels carrying goods consigned to it.  The  Swedish ForeignOffice has replied  to enquiries that the above  statement is misleading as Swedishstandard export goods can still to a considerable extent be sent to Dutch consigneesother than the Netherlands Overseas Trust.    Negotiations for German Coal. The Swedish Press of July .15th  reports thatMr.  Forst,  of  the HandelskommissioiPs Coal  Bureau, and.  Mr. Akerman,  of  the stockholm Wood. Fuel Company, are at present in Berlin negotiating for the  import of German coal into Sweden,  the  existing agreement with Germany terminating  onSeptember 1st.

Rumhold expresses  himself as satisfied with  the system  of  Allied control over fuel  and  war material  provided for Swissindustries executing orders for the Allies.    Projected Acquisition of Tonnage  in Spain:- The Foreign Office learns that the austrians are offering the Swiss Government three Austrian ships  in Spanish ports.The Austrians insist that the vessels woidd have to be returned after the war.  this tonnage is inadequate to Swiss requirements.   The Germans also offer three ships, tobe selected  from  four, two of  which are in Spain  and two  in the Dutch Indies ; HisMajesty&apos;s Government has objected to  the  employment of the  latter.  It is probablethat certain Spanish vessels wull be made available for use under the Swiss flag.     Swedish-Swiss Traffic via Germany. There has  been  an. exchange of views at berne between the representatives of  the Swedish and Swiss Governments regardingthe  transit trade between the. two countries  through Germany.  Sweden desires tosend, to Switzerland minerals, iron, steel, cellulose,  &amp;c, and Switzerland desires tosend textile fabrics and chemical, products to Sweden.  The  German  authoritiesrequire ail  such  goods  to  be transhipped, at the  frontier and  forwarded by Germanfirms, who  exact a heavy commission.   They are systematically impeding  the  transitof neutral goods which German  firms are themselves able  to  supply, and they onlygrant facilities for this transit trade to firms which had  business  relations with  theNorthern Neutrals before the war.  They are evidently anxious  to prevent (a)  thedevelopment  of  any new trade  between Switzerland and Scandinavia,  and (6) to prohibit firms which work for the Allies from  participating.  In retaliation the Allieswull henceforth refuse all applications by German firms in Switzerland for licences totrade with Scandinavia  in  goods imported  through  the S.S.S.   The InteralliedCommission at Berne is accordingly asking the S.S.S. to furnish it with a list of Swiss firms which exported silk to the Northern Neutrals before the war.     German Contracts. The Swiss munition  factories which have been working on German munition coutracts  now  find, themselves in  a  critical  position.   A largeproportion  of  these  contracts expired in May and have not  been renewed.  There  are some 250  Swiss factories  working  for  Germany,  employing  about  40,000 men. M. Hoffmann has protested, on behalf  of the firms concerned, to the German Legation at Berne, but without result.  Many of these factories have erected, special plant, and allege  that they  have  not  yet covered their  initial expenses.  The Germans have offered to  place wdth them orders for peace articles, but it will  take time and money to adapt the workshops to a new class of  work.      German Propaganda on Swiss View  of a  League of  Nations and Freedom of the Seas. German Wireless of  July  12th states  : &quot; The Swiss  President of the Bund, Colonder, said in a  speech before the Swiss National  Council, with regard to a league of nations, that  Switzerland ought not  under any circumstances to join  such  a league unless the particular  kind  of  independence  which she  now enjoys and  her equality of rights were sufficiently guaranteed.  The differences  between nations in development and individual  requirements were too  great  for them to be forced into
ISamions indiscriminately.   The aim should be  to  guarantee peaceful development to every nation, and one fundamental requirement in this, respect for all nations is theguarantee of access to the seas of the world.&quot;     A similar propaganda is being carried out through the Swedish Press, eg. : &quot;Lenin understands realpolitik.  His protest to England was not, therefore, directed against the retention of warships and troops in a neutral port,  though this, of course,is a gross breach of international law, but against  the  attempt, which  England inpursuance of her traditional policy is making,  to cut  off Russia from all access to thesea.   Idie Entente  proceedings  in Siberia are part of the same  policy.   It is  trueRussia was promised -the Dardanelles, but simultaneously England  seized the Greekislands, and, moreover, she knew that she could always close the Mediterranean.  Forthis  reason the same importance is not  to be  attached to German action in the black sea.  The same method is to be adopted against the  small  neutrals,  includingSwitzerland, which has no sea coast.&quot;   (Aftonbtadet, June .19th  and 22nd ;  cf. SvenskaDagbladet, June 22nd,  and see next paragraph,)     German Designs to control Swiss Overseas Trade. A report, received   emphasises the desirability of watching German efforts to  obtain  control of Swiss overseas tradeafter the  Avar.  German  activity in this direction is already noticeable in ItalianSAvitzerland.  The  hope  is expressed  that the advantages of the projected  RhoneCanal will not be monopolised by Germany.

Russia. &quot;According to German Wireless of July 11th, the exchange of ratifyingdocuments in relation to the Brest Peace &quot;Treaty  took  place between  the  &quot; RussianAmbassador &quot; and the  Bulgarian  Charge d&apos;Affaires at Berlin on Inly 9th.     Mr  Wardrop on.

Germany. German Wireless1 of July 13th gives the following account of Count.Hertling&apos;8 pronouncement in the  Main Committee  of the  Reichstag, about the futureof Belgium : &quot; The occupation and present possession of Belgium only signifies that    1 German Wireless of July 12th gave the  opening portion of Count Hertling&apos;s speech delivered bivJuly 11th.

we have a pledge (Faustpfancl) as a pawn in future negotiations.   We do  not  intend to retain Belgium in any form Avliatever.   We desire that Belgium shall he resurrectedafter the war as an independent State which shall  not he  subjugated to  anybody andshall live with  us in good friendly relations.&quot;  German  Wireless of the  same dateadded  that, after his first  speech on the Belgian  question  on July  12th,  CountHertling said : &quot; With regard to the future of Belgium, the occupation and presentpossession  of Belgium  only signifies  that we have a pledge  in  future  negotiations.What is understood by &apos; pledge &apos; (Faustpfancl) is&apos; that Avhat  one has  in one&apos;s hand asa pawn is  not to be  retained if the negotiations lead to  favourable results.  We donot aim to retain Belgium in any form.  We desire just what I stated on February 24th,that the Belgium which shall arise after the Avar shall be an independent  State subjectto no one, and that she shall live in good  and friendly relations with us.   That is  the standpoint which I have taken regarding the Belgian  problem from the beginningand to which I still adhere to-day.&quot;   On the following day German. Wireless reportedlively Press comments on  the chancellors  declarations, and  added that the papersunanimously remarked that the willingness of the German Government to give backBelgium on the conclusion of peace had never before been so clearly and unreservedlystated.  The time of ending  the further deprivation of the freedom of Belgium would.depend upon the readiness for  peace  of the Entente  Powers.   After this  discussion,the Reichstag appears  to  have concluded its summer  Session, and  adjourned untilNovember 5th.    Information received from Sir W.
