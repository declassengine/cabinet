PEACE DTSOUSSTONS (see page  15).     Differences between Bulgaria, Turkey, and the Central Powers about peace termsseem to  be in process  of adjustment, but likely to be  accentuated by failure on thepart of die Centra]  Powers to gain great successes  in  Prance and Flanders, or in,Italy.&apos;  The new Bulgarian Prime Minister is credited with a desire to  gain  time byplaying oil&apos; the Allies against the Central  Powers, and  finally to take the side of the victorious group the attitude of the Bat in  the Battle of the Birds and the Beasts.

PART  II.-FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.     Sinkings. According to  the War Trade  Intelligence  Bureau, the  total  tonnageof 500 tons  gross in the  case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in. the case of sailing-ships, reported lost  owing to the malice  of the King&apos;s enemies during the periodJune 28th-July 4th inclusive,  was 82,952 tons gross, of which 52,719 were British, ascompared wdth 41,976 tons gross, of which  34,028 were British, reported last week.     Convoys. The  Ministry of  Shipping reports that of  10,800  ships, representing77,082,400   deadweight   capacity,  convoyed   (homewards  and  outwards)  up  toJune 29th,  1918,  112 ships, representing  810,200 deadweight capacity, have  been sunk, the percentage lost thus being  1&quot; 03 of ships and I&apos;04 of deadweight capacity.     Far East. [Note. This subject is now dealt with in the Eastern Report.]     Hospital Ships. The notification regarding the torpedoing of the Hospital  ShipLlandovery Castle, mentioned  in Report No. 75, has now been amplified to show thatthe  attack  was made under the orders  of  some  superior authority  and  that  itdemonstrates a settied plan to destroy hospital ships on  any or no evidence withoutexercising the right of visit and search.  The facts leave  little doubt that the Germancommander  attempted to slaughter by ramming and gunfire all the witnesses ofhis crime.   A  Wolff message of July 3rd, German Wireless of July 7th  and theGerman Press generally argue in denial or justification.  The Osservatore  Romano(the  official organ of  the Vatican) is quoted by Italian Wireless of July 6th as saying :&quot; We cannot do less than express extreme displeasure in reading this account.  We aresure  that Germany itself would be the first to feel horror, and will not fail to take propersteps.  This is not the first time that Germany has  committed  similar acts against which the entire civilised  world has been indignant.&quot; The  Butch Nieuios  van denDag  (July 4th)  says: -&quot; This  fresh  crime  will  certainly cause  an  increase  ofexasperation,  and a growth  of the war spirit in America, and will  prolong thewar.   This   misdeed  against  defenceless  people  wdll   be  revenged  on   otherdefenceless  ones.    It   goes   without  saying that  neither  the  German  people(though  there  the majority  are blindfolded)  nor  the British  people  (though  theyare  rightly  embittered)   are  to be  blamed, but  the  spirit  of militarism whichamong the  Germans is  now  more  deeply rooted  and in. a stronger  manner  thananywhere else in the world.   It wras this  same  spirit  which,  under military pretexts,destroyed the precious work of  art of  Rheims Cathedral, and which shot  defencelessBelgian civilians.&quot;   The Foreign Office is  enquiring the views of the French and united Slates Governments as to requesting the King of  Spain to obtain the assent ofthe enemy Governments to the carriage of  Spanish naval officers in hospital ships inthe Atlantic, in accordance with the  scheme  already successfully employed in theMediterranean.     Anglo-German  Conference   regarding Prisoners. Discussions  at The Haguecontimre.  Numerous points have been raised, to which allusion wall be made in next week&apos;s issue of this Report.
ALLIED  GROUP.                                   BELGIUM.     The Council of Flanders. -The  following  semi-official  statement  was issued atLe Havre on duly 3rd, in reply to the pronouncements emoted in Reports Nos. 74 and75 : &quot; The German Government has just caused  the so-called Council of Flanders,which is in reality nothing but the instrument  of  its. policy, to address to it, in theperson, of the German Governor-General, a declaration in which the Council pledgesitself without reserve to rally to the aims of the war  waged by the German  Empire.The German propaganda service represents the declaration as a profession of faith onthe  part  of  the Flemish population,  although the latter have by the most violentdemonstration  repudiated  and. branded as  infamous the  handful  of  traitors whoconstitute the Council of Flanders.   The  document now  published is a new act oftreason, and  bears striking testimony to the German inspiration which prompted itand  which has permeated the Activist intrigues  from the very beginning.   With-servile docility, the hired agents of the German Administration  call for the destructionof Belgian, nationality and  the  splitting  up of their country.  Moreover, they placetheir hopes of salvation in the German Empire, and announce that the independence-of Flanders will be guaranteed by Germany, whose protection they implore.  By so doing, they are adopting the classical  thesis  of Pan-Germanism ;  they are  excusingthe violation of Belgium&apos;s neutrality and they are repudiating the national  Govern-ment and casting in their lot Avith  the enemy.   The document bears  witness to the true character of the Council of Flanders, wdiich ;was  never anything  but  a secretdepartment of  the German administration.   The  new  declaration of  the Council ofFlanders will arouse the scorn of all Belgians.  It is a challenge to national sentimentand  will certainly increase  the vowed hatred  of  the Belgian  people for the invaders.and  their accomplices.&quot;     Clothing for Inhabitants of Occupied Territory in Belgium and Northern France.- -Sir W. Townley transmits an urgent request 133&apos; the French and Belgian ministers at the Hague  for  reconsideration  by His  MajestyV  Government of  its  decision regarding an increase in the present restricted  import of clothes for distribution bythe Relief Commission among the inhabitants  of  occupied territory in Belgium andNorthern France.                                    BRAZIL.    Economic  Co-operation with  the  Allies. The  United States Government  has suggested  to   the  Brazilian  Government  that  a  conference  should  be held  inAVashmgton, at which representatives of the Allies should  attend, for  the purposeof discussing  a scheme for. protection of the essential economic  interests of Brazil,so as to permit of the employment  by her of her great resources to  the best advantage in the prosecution, of  the war.   It  is anticipated that such  a  conference  might resultin relieving Brazil  of certain restrictions at present necessarily  imposed upon  hertrade by Allied war measures,  and that alternative measures  might be evolved on thelines indicated in Reports Nos. 69, 71, and 75.                                     CHINA.     Tibet. Sir J. Jordan  reports that the Chinese General Officer Commanding at Batang has declared himself unable to hold out against- the Tibetans any longer, and desires that pending instructions from  Peking, a truce  should be arranged and a provisional frontier fixed  by mediation  (see  Report  No. 65).   The Chinese Prime Minister considers  that  present circumstances are unfavourable for a definite agree- ment which would  necessitate  the  concurrence  of the  Szechuan Government.  It-would seem that the  Central  Government is prepared  to  postpone action in the expectation  of  regaining  control  of  Szechuan.  Meanwhile,  Sir  J.  Jordan  has-authorised a representative to offer his services towards a provisional local settlement.
                                -   I4&apos;RANGE.    France and the Vatican. The question of the resumption of relations between france  and the Vatican has for some time past &quot;been discussed in the French Press,and this has been commented  on in the Italian newspapers.  M. Denis Cochin, leader of the Catholic Party of the French Chamber, is at  present in Rome, where he  hasbeen received by the Pope and the Cardinal Secretary of State.  This visit, coinciding-as it does with the renewal of relations between the Holy See and  Portugal  (see under&quot; Portugal &quot;) is causing considerable interest.                                    [ITALY.    Italian War-Aims.  A Memorandum  (G.T.  5028),  dated July  3rd, by  thePolitical Intelligence Department, discusses the incompatibility of Baron Sonnino&apos;policy,  as  supported by  the League of National  Defence and  expounded  by  theGiornale d&apos;Italia, with that  of the Left wing of the Interventionist bloc.   While hiscontinuance in the Administration enables it to present a solid front against defeatism,it is nevertheless very desirable that increased support and  encouragement  should begiven to those elements which take a more  liberal view regarding Italian aspirations,Balkan questions, and the future of the Austrian subject races, in order that the stability of the Italian Government may not be permanently dependent on the Chauvinist sectionof the Coalition.                                    JAPAN.    Japan and the Allies. -A Press report  states that Viscount Ishii, the japanese ambassador, speaking at Fairhaven (Mass.) on July 4th, pledged Japan to contributeher full  share  in  the war  in  the way which in her judgment was most efficient andconducive  to  success.   He characterised the rumour of  a possible rapprochementbetween  Japan  and Germany as a  fine specimen of  German intrigue  designed to separate  the Allies.   It  betrayed,  he  said, utter ignorance of Japanese character.In whatever other  qualities they were wanting, the Japanese people were  not  lackingin a chivalrous  spirit.  The Ambassador, in conclusion, paid a tribute to Americanpatriotism  as conspicuously  demonstrated  in  the  country&apos;s  preparation  for  andprosecution of  the war.   Viscount Ishii delivered the following message from thepeople of Japan to the people of the United  States : &quot; We  trust you, love you, andif you let us, will walk at  your side in loyal good fellowship down all the coming-years.&quot;                                   PANAMA.    Elections. Sir C. Mallet reports  that  the  election of deputies took place onJuly 7th  throughout the  Panama Republic.  It appears from the  result that  theOpposition will have a majority in the next Chamber.  The elections were supervisedby United  States military forces.                                  PORTUGAL.    Portugal and the Vatican. The Foreign Office learns that diplomatic relations-between Portugal and the Holy See have been, renewed.  Portugal is to be represented at the Vatican by Captain Decastro, and a Nuncio is about to be appointed to Lisbon.    Parliament. According to a Press  report, a  decree  was issued on July 7th bythe Portuguese Government convoking Parliament,  which is expected to meet on.July 15th.   (AncUsee Report No. 75.)
                               UNITED STATES.    President Wilson&apos;&apos;s Speech on July with. The following is the material passage ofthe speech delivered by President Wilson on July 4th at Washington&apos;s tomb : &quot; Onthe one hand stand the peoples of the world not only the peoples  actually engagedbut many others also who suffer under mastery but cannot act ; peoples of many races and in every part of the world the people  of stricken Russia still, among the rest,though they are for the moment unorganised, and  helpless.  Opposed to them, mastersof many armies, stands  an isolated, friendless  group  of Governments who speak nocommon, purpose but only selfish ambitions of their own, by which none can profit butthemselves and whose people are fuel in their  hands; Governments which fear their people and  yet are for the time their sovereign, lords, making  every choice for themand disposing of their lives  and fortunes as  they will,  as well as  of  the lives and fortunes of  every  people who  fall, under  their  power Governments clothedwith  the strange trappings &quot;and. primitive authority  of  an age  that  is altogetheralien   and  hostile  to  our  own.    The  past  and  the   present  are  in   deadlygrapple, and  the  peoples of  the  world  are  being  done to  death  between  them.There  can   be but  one issue.    The   settlement must be final.    There can  beno compromise.  No halfway  decision  would  be tolerable.  No halfway decision isconceivable.   These are the  ends for which the  associated  peoples of  the world  are fighting, and which must be conceded  them  before  there can be peace : First,  thedestruction  of every arbitrary power anywhere that  can&quot;separately, secretly,  and ofits single choice  disturb the  peace of the  world; or, if  it cannot be  presentlydestroyed, at the least  its reduction to virtual  impotence.  Second,  the settlementof  every question, whether of  territory,  of  sovereignty, of economic arrangement, orof political,  relationship,  upon the basis of. the free acceptance of that settlement by the people immediately concerned, and not upon the basis of the material interest or advantage  of any other nation or people which may desire  a  different settlement for the sake of its  own  exterior influence or mastery.  Third, the consent  of  all nations to be governed  in their conduct  towards  each other by  the  same principlesof honour and  of respect for the common  law of civilised  society that govern  theindividual citizens  of all. modern  States, and in  their relations  with one anotherto  the  end  that  all  promises  and   covenants  may  be  sacredly  observed,  noprivate plots or conspiracies  hatched, no selfish injuries wrought  with impunity anda mutual trust established upon  the handsome foundation  of a  mutual respect forright-   Fourth, the establishment  of an  organisation of peace which shall make itcertain that the combined power  qf free nations will check every invasion of right, andserve to make peace and justice the more secure by affording a  definite tribunal ofopinion to which all must submit, and by which every international readjustment thatcannot be amicably agreed upon by the  peoples directly concerned shall be sanctioned.These great objects can be put into a single sentence.  What we seek is the reign oflaw based upon the consent of  the  governed and  sustained  by the organised opinionof mankind.&quot;  Lord Reading reports that particular satisfaction was expressed by the presidents audience (and has been echoed in. the  Press) with the statement that there could  be no compromise.     United States&apos;. Military Effort. In  a letter  addressed  by Mr. Baker on July 1stto  President  Wilson the overseas military achievements of&apos;  the United States are summarised  as follows: &quot;The  first   ship carrying  military personnel  sailed  onMay 8th, 1917, having on  board  Base  Hospital  No.  4  and  members of the ReserveNurses  Force.   General IJershing and his  staff  sailed on May 20th, 1917.  Theembarkations  in the  months  from  May 1917 to  and including June 1918  are  asfollows :-&apos;Year 1917 :  May, 1,718 ;  June,  12,261 ;  July,  12,988 ;  August, 18,823 ;September, 32,423 ;  October, 38,249 ; November, 23,016 ; December,  48,840.  Year1.918:  January,  46,776; February,  48,027; March. 83,811;  April,  117,212; May,244,345; June, 276,372;  Marines, 14;644.   Total, 1,019,115.  The total number oftroops returned from abroad, lost at sea, and casualties is 8,165.   Of  these, by reasonof the superbly efficient protection  which the Navy has given to our transport system,only 291 have been lost at sea.   The supplies  and equipment in France for  all thetroops sent are, by the latest report, adequate,  and the oritput of our Avar  industries in this country is showing marked, improvement in practically all lines of necessary equipment and supplies.&quot;  According to a  Press  report, a  supplementary statement
prepared by Mr. Baker for the House of Representatives shows that there  are  now16,400 officers and 2,010,000 men with  the colours, as compared with 9,524 officersand 202,510 men,  Regulars and  National Guard,  14 months ago.   According to tireEvening Post (New York.  July 4th), Mr. Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, in the courseof an  address  to  the Tammany Society at New York, declared: &quot;The  nationallaunching to-day as part of  the celebration of  the  national holiday amounted to moretonnage than the United  States  have lost in  the  whole progress of  the war.   Morethan  400,000 deadweight  tons  are  going into the water  to-day,  while  the totalAmerican tonnage destroyed by  German submarines  is estimated at 352,000 dead-weight tons, including 68,000  tons  before  the  United States entered the war.&quot;  Astatement by Sir William Goode regarding the achievements  of  the United StatesGovernment and people in the provision of food to the  Allies is reported in The times of July 11th at page 3.    The United States and the  Economic  Defensive. A Memorandum (G.T. 5018),dated June  29th, by the Political Intelligence Department discusses the altitude of theUnited States  towards an  Allied Economic Defensive.  The American public willprobably be ready to follow the President in the conclusion of comprehensive economic arrangements with the  Allies  so long  as these arrangements  bear the stamp  ofGovernment action  in the interests  of   consumers.  The business community  isprobably  ready to acquiesce in  any measure  of  Government control which can berepresented as  stimulating  the  efficiency of American industry and  as  establishingarrangements  of  mutual  advantage with other nations  ; it  would  probably beimpatient of any  use  of  Government  control  against Germany  after   the  war on purely sentimental or vindictive grounds, but even on  such  grounds  would  probablybe  prepared  to  approve  some  slight  measure  of  sentimental  preference  to theAllies ; and on   commercial grounds  would  view  with  approval   any movement towards  commercial  arrangements  of  mutual  advantage  at the present  moment,leaving the conclusion of  similar  arrangements with  Germany  for subsequent consideration.   Official    opinion,   which has   learned   to   distrust   german trade  enterprises, would  certainly  take  a  cordial  interest  in  any  proposals made by the Allies and especially by the British Empire.  The President  has already declared, that the  United. States  does &quot; not wish to fight (Germany) either with armsor with hostile arrangements of trade, if she  is willing  to associate herself with us and the other peace-loving nations of the world in covenants of justice and law and fair-dealing&quot;;  but that1&apos;if the German people ....  after the war  is over,, continueto be  obliged  to  live under ambitious  and intriguing masters, interested to disturbthe peace of the world .... it might be impossible  ....  to admit Germany to thefree economic intercourse which  must inevitably spring out of the other partnershipsof a real peace.&quot;   The President is certainly inclined towards close co-operation withthe British Empire,  while opposed  to  any vindictive or purely sentimental actionagainst Germany.  The  attitude  of  Congress  will be  influenced in practice  by theinterest  of  the cotton growers of the South ; but roughly it may be said that thegrowth of the cotton manufacturing industry in the United States and the threateneddecrease in cotton production will probably enable the Administration, to assure thecotton growers of a very favourable market within the United  States, which, whencombined with the competitive demand  of the Allies, may, in the eyes of the Southern growers,  be enough to ensure such high prices that the)7 would not  insist on addingthe  German demand to. the other factors in  the market,  (See  also  Memorandum G.T. 5051,  dated.  July 8th.)     Elections  in  South Dakota. Mr.  Bay ley  reports that  the  Non-Partisan League has been generally successful in the South Dakota elections, but that  its majorities have been reduced.   (And  see Reports Nos. 71 and 74.)     German Propaganda regarding the Untied States and the Latin-American, States.  German Wireless  of July 6th (?), serial No. 5286, quotes an article from the Koelnische Zeitung designed to show that those Latin-American States which  have declared war on Germany have been forced by President Wilson, to  do so. It is further suggested that the President has attempted unsuccessfully to exploit the  man-power of  these States.  (And  see. Report No. 73 under  &quot; Mexico.&quot;)
ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    General Conditions.-According to a report received, by  the  Foreign Office  thepolitical and economic crises in Austria-Hungary are growing daily more acute.   TheSocialist leaders could easily provoke a  successful revolution, but are held  back bythe consciousness among the labouring classes that  an uprising would, owing to  the ensuing  dislocation,  result in  literal famine.   Seidler  has  promised  the  Socialistleaders  an early peace; but Austria hopes to bring  the  Allies  to  a compromisewithout concessions on her part either  to  them or  to the  subject races.   Relationsbetween. Vienna and Berlin, are  strained : there is a fear lest  German  garrisons  maybe established in Austria-Hungary to keep order.   While Vienna is anxious, Budapestis clamorous, for peace.  The feeling in the dual Monarchy is one of apathetic fatalism.The Austrian censorship has recently let through letters to Switzerland probably withthe intention, by means of the disclosures  they contain, to bring pressure on Berlinthrough neutral channels.  These letters show that Tyrol and Styria, hitherto  regardedas buttresses of the Monarchy, are in a state of effervescence owing  to the wretchedcondition of the -population, who are decimated  by famine and consequent disease.The prospects  of  the  coming harvest in  East  and  West  Galicia  (the  principalgranary   of  Austria),  is  extremely  dark,  owing  to  (1)  the  enormous area ofuncultivated  land,  (2) prolonged drought, and (3) severe  frosts in May and dune,The  problem  of  feeding the -population  till  next  harvest  is extremely  grave.Not onlj-  the  local population, but a  number of  refugees  wdll have to he   fed.The situation is aggravated by the requisitioning in East Galicia of seed destined forsowing, which compelled the people to  sow corn put aside for  bread.  Added  to theabove are the  lack  of agricultural  implements,  scarcity of labour owing  to the impossibility of supporting harvesting  soldiers,  the need of workshops for repairs,and the fact that milch cows have been  requisitioned for the needs of the army in thefield.  Informant considers  that the  maintenance of the maxima prices now in  force for cereals will spell ruin, for agriculture, and that unless preparations  are  made atonce for autumn sowing, the country will not recover for two years.   The seizure of motor and steam ploughs will render this work more difficult.   A further report statesthat the  harvest in Rumania,  Bessarabia,  and. Bulgaria will be  very  bad, and  thatthere is already great economic distress in the latter country.     &quot; Ex-lex &quot; Situation. A Vienna telegram to the  Frankfurter Zeibung (July 2nd),states that the ex-lex  situation  in Austria began on July 1st,  in  consequence of theProvisional Budget having expired.                                  GERMANY.     General Conditions. According  to the Berliner Tageblatt,  one meatless week  amonth is to  be introduced in Germany as from August.   A report received by theForeign Office from a good source indicates that conditions in Germany are worse than is generally known.   With regard to the  harvest,  information  shows that while thecornfields in  South Germany and the  Rhine provinces are in good condition, they arepoor in North Germany, and in East Germany the crops have been badly damaged byfrost and snowfall.   (Optimistic official reports  continue to be issued, e.g., in german wireless of July  9th.)  According to another  report,  the hushing  up  of  Allied air raids is very  significant of their actual and potential effect.  It is  stated that seriousdisturbances  are possible at Dusseldorf owing to  the irritation of the inhabitants at the apparent inability of the authorities to defend the town.     Direction  of  Foreign Policy. German Wireless of  July  10th announces thatthe  Kaiser has accepted  the. resignation  of the Foreign Secretary, von Kiihlmann(see  Report  No.  75).  Admiral  von Hintze,  German  Minister  at Christiania, is,.mentioned as his probable successor, though no- final decision has yet been made.The  careers  of the  two  men  are sketched.    The Foreign  Office  learns  thatvon  Kuhlmann wished  to resign after the recent  debates in the Reichstag,  but was  dissuaded  by the&quot; Chancellor who declared that he himself  would resign if
-von Ivuhlmann. went.  Other candidates for the Foreign Secretaryship are von Payer,who would be the nominee of the Reichstag, and Stumm, Head of the Political Sectionof  the Foreign Office, who is said to be working with the pan-Germans and to enjoy the confidence of the General Staff.     A German of moderate views is reported as expressing the opinion that the onlytrustworthy men in Germany are  the officials  of the Foreign Office, who  are  muchmore really liberal in their  views  than  most t; Liberal.&quot; members  of  the Reichstag.Zimmerman was the only pan-German amongst them, and  his reign was short.   Butthey  lack the  courage to stand up to the military  part)- and the pan-Germans, whohave poured ceaseless ridicule upon them since the beginning of the war, so that theyhave ended by becoming a by-word for inefficient timidity, both iuside Germany  andwithout.     According to  Press reports,  Scheiclemann, in the recent deflate,  criticised the apparent subservience of the civil to the military authority and declared the intentionof  the  Socialists  to  vote  against the  budget.  The Frankfurter  Zeitung,  whileregretting this decision, observes : &quot; One can  read  between the lines of  the Vice-Chan cellor&apos;s speech  that  in carrying out its plans, the  Government has  had tostruggle with  strong hindrances, and  it is pretty clear that these  hindrances are tobe  found where  Herr Scheidemann sought them.   It is  quite self-evident that anarmy command which has had by its acts such a tremendous influence on Germany&apos;sfate has  a right to an important share in the  deliberations in which  Germany&apos;s  and europe&apos;s future  will  be decided.  That has been  so in  former times.  The point to-day, however, is the fact which, indeed, is  daily emphasised  by the conservative and Pan-German papers  that the Supreme Army Command is the deciding authority.It must  emphatically  be demanded that full light  shall be shed on the relation-ship  between  the Army and  the civil  authorities  and  the  direction of german policy.&quot;    Post-war  Economics. A German opinion regarding  the  utility  of  an  Anglo-American post-bellum  blockade  of Germany  is reported as follows to the ForeignOffice.  It is essential to distinguish  between the heavy industrials and the ordinary business men.  The former would be unaffected by such  a threat.  They are led byStinnes and Kirdorff, who work baud in hand with the pan-Germans and the military party, and keep a number of paid  agents in the Reichstag.   They believe that theycan get unlimited supplies of raw material out of Russia; are determined to maintaineconomic and  political  supremacy over Belgium  ;  and, principalPy, aim at  the annexation  of  the  Briey Basin and  Longwy, so as to cripple France industrially.The ordinary business men, on  the other hand, share the hopes of the mass  of theGerman  people for a  period of booming commercial prosperity after the  war as areward for their privations.   This hope  it would be possible to  destroy by reiteratedand strongly-worded threats of a post-bellum economic blockade.   Though their  fearsmight not be apparent, they would be  terrified at  heart, and there would  be  muchworking,  underground, of which  the  chief evidence worth! be a strengthening ofthe  hands  of  the anti-annexationist  parties  in  the  country.   (See  also reports nos. 03-68 and 70  and under &quot; United States.&quot;)    Another report received deals with the post-war financial problem.   The only hope of improving the exchange and of being  in a position  to import  raw materials would be to float loans in neutral countries ; but it  is difficult  to see how this couldbe  done  on a  sufficient  scale.  Moreover, the want of raw materials will make itinrpossible to improve the exchange by increased production. The very fact that somuch of the capital of the  country is tied up  in War Loans will operate against the renewal  of trade, owing  to the  difficulty of realising  the  money for investment else-where.   Faced with the prospect of bankruptcy, but still able to borrow, the germans are prepared to gamble on the chance  of  a military victory and repayment  by heavyindemnities.     The &quot; Hanoverian &quot;  Parly.-That  the Guelph movement  in Hanover still survivesis shown by some remarks  appearing in the Deutsche Volkszeitung. the official  organof  the German Hanoveriau  Party, quoted  in  the  Hheinisch Westfalische Zeitvng(July 1st).  The paper says; &quot; The hope of  a clay of resurrection  for  Hanover tofreedom  and independence, under the  older Guelph  House,  has not been  shaken tothis day in the people of Hanover.  The hour  of freedom wdll  at  last strike for usalso.&quot;
    Cinematograph Combine. In order to give  the German cinematograph, industryabroad  a  position equal to that  of  the greatest of the  Entente film companies, anagreement has been reached between tire Deutsche Lichtbild Gesellschaft,  &quot; which was founded for the purpose of promoting German economic and Ivultur propaganda,&quot; andthe Universum Film Gesellschaft, whose capital is Mk. 25,000,000.  The DeutscheTageszeitung (July 1st) says  that the agreement arrived at delimits the respectivefields of operation of these two companies  at  home, but provides  for joint  operations in foreign lands.   (And see Report No. 71.)NEUTRAL GROUP.                                   ALBANIA.    Views of  M. Venizelos on  the future  of  Albania. The views of M. Venizeiosregarding the future of Albania  are reported as follows  to the Foreign. Office.  the ideal is an. independent Albanian State ; but as it is  doubtful  whether this  solutionwill at first be practicable, the Powers might jointly appoint a Governor for a certainterm of years  until such  time   as  the  country  should  acquire the  capacity for self-government; if, after  a fair trial,  it became  clear that its national life was  animpossibility, partition might be necessary.  Albania  should, not  be in the hands ofany  Great Power,  though Italy might  by all  means  keep  Valona  as a  sort of gibraltar.                           ARGENTINE  REPUBLIC.     German Organisation in the  Argentine.  A. report received lays stress on theefforts made by the Germans to secure a strong commercial and industrial position inthe  Argentine  (and Chile).  Possessed of  enormous capital, the German  colony  isthoroughly organised for the acquisition of  key industries and  commodities as wellas for  the  obtaining of information  and  the dissemination of  trade  and  otherpropaganda.                                   BOLIVIA.    British Special Mission. A La Paz message (July 4th) states : &quot; The Workmen&apos;s)Societies and the school  children formed a procession yesterday morning in honour ofSir Maurice  de Bunsen&apos;s visit.   In the evening there Avas a State reception at the palace, and  speeches were made  by members of the Bolivian GoArernment  and bySir Maurice  de Bxmsen, testifying to the friendly relations existing betAveen  GreatBritain and Bolivia.&quot;   Mr. Haggard reports that the Avelcome universally given to theMission has been most cordial.   The President, at a special banquet, laid stress uponthe desirability of closer commercial relations  between. Bolivia  and  Great Britain,particularly  in  regard  to  banking.  Public  anxiety regarding  the  provision  of aeroplanes to Chile (see Reports Nos. 73 under &quot; Chile &quot; and 74 and 75 under &quot; Peru &quot;)has noAv subsided.             CHILE.(See under &quot;Argentine Republic.&quot;)                                  DENMARK.    Relations with Iceland. Air.  Cable reports that  the  negotiations betAveen the danish  and  Icelandic delegates   will probably terminate  this  Aveek.   It would.
seem  that  Denmark  is  anxious  for an  amicable  settlement,  and  this feeling  isreciprocated,  locally. - The Reykjavik papers  &quot;are  being  liberally  supplied  fromCopenhagen  with  propaganda emphasising that  an  independent  Iceland  wouldbe in  danger of falling into  the vassalage of  a  Great Power; they  are, however,unanimous in their opinion that Great Britain, at any rate, would not encroach  uponIcelandic sovereignty. It is expected that Denmark will agree to recognise the Ice-landic flag, and that the relation between the two  countries will be defined as a personalunion, subject to the temporary delegation to Denmark of certain functions, includingthe administration of foreign affairs.  There is some difference of opinion as to whetherfull rights  of Icelandic citizenship may be claimed by Danish subjects as such.   (and see Reports Nos.  50, 54,  67-71, 73 and 74.)    Organisation of Imports. It  is reported that a group)  of prominent  Danishbusiness men are planning an organisation  which will supervise -the purchase of all supplies required by Denmark from overseas.  The organisation will determine whatsupplies are necessary,  and what prices  shall  be  paid.  They will  distribute  their orders between Germany and  the Allies according  to the state of the  market.   Theorganisation  hope to be able, to control cargo space on Danish  ships  in  accordancewith their import programmes,     Inter-Scandinavian  Economic Exchange. Conferences between the three Scaudi-scandinavian countries have  resulted, in the formation of permanent  committees for examining their  respective  resources, and  arranging suitable  economic  exchanges.The Danes are finding a  market in Norway and Sweden for their agricultural produce(at present Norway and Sweden are taking more than half the-Danish butter surplus,see Report  No.  75).   Norway offers  fish,  saltpetre, minerals  and chemicals ; Swedenoffers timber, wood, tar, wood pulp, metals  and horses.   To an increasing extentFinland is being brought within the range of this inter-Scandinavian  trade.                                   FINLAND.    Finland raid the North. The  Foreign Office learns that the  Germans areawaiting developments in Russia before definitely  launching  their expedition from finland.  The  main attack will probably  be made from Lake Ladoga,  where two German submarines are already operating.   An aeroplane station is being constructedat Hango.  72,000 rations are being prepared.   It seems to be  established that  thereare at least 50,000 German troops  in the country.   The majority of  these are  statedto be  concentrated  on the Karelian frontier.   Movements  will thence  be directed against petshenga  and  the  southern part  of the Murmansk Railway.  An advanceguard of 500 men had already started northward before July 3rd, and detachmentscontinue to follow.   Troops  are  constantly arriving at  Kyro,  south  of Lake Enara.Provision  stations  are  being  established  along  the  road  from  Rovaniemi anda field railway from  Rovaniemi to Kyro will shortly be completed.  Finns  born in-theyears  1892 to  1896 inclusive have  been recalled  to military service, the Ministerfor War explaining that  Finnish interests now coincide  with those of the Bolshevists.There is reason to  believe  that special  efforts  are being made   from  Berlin topress  the candidature of the Duke of Mecklenburg for the Finnish throne and. probably also  to eugineer a  declaration  by  Finland of war against  the Allies.  It  wouldappear that there is now  considerable  friction between the German and Finnishtroops, the latter&apos; being opposed to a Monarchy and to the proposed operations in theNorth and  East.  Feeling in favour  of a  Republican  Government  is growing, andthe Finnish Army  Council is reported to have  assented with reluctance  to Finnishparticipation in &quot; Dr. Renwalhs operations.&quot;    The majority of the Finnish public alsoopposes the scheme, and  Swedishdrinnish opinion is practically unanimous against it.The action of the Finnish Government towards  the Swedish-Finns arouses increasingirritation in  the  Swedish  Press,  and there  are  signs of dissatisfaction even  inthe Conservative papers.   There  is a  growing  feeling  in   Finland against theGermans, largely due to  their  continual  thefts and  to  the  Commercial  Treaty.The present restrictions on  the Finnish  Press  are  -reported  to  be  worse  than anything under  the severest  Russian  regime : (the  following statements should therefore,  perhaps,  be  considered  in this  light).   The  Swedish  Aflonblad  ofJuly  3rd  reproduces a  telegram  from  the  Finnish  News Bureau stating that  adeputation  from Russian  Karelia  has been   received  by  the  Finnish Govern-ment,  and on  behalf  of  the  population  has  urged  the  incorporation  of that
district in  Finland ;  also,  that  the  inhabitants  of.  Iugermanland  have  asked theFinnish  Government to do  all  possible to improve  the  situation of  the raciallyconnected population of that region.   The Finnish Press publishes extracts from theMinutes  of  the  Red  Government at Viborg indicating that -British  assistance was offered to that Government.  (It may be mentioned that, according to a report fromSir M. Findlay, responsible quarters in Norway strongly deprecate British co-operationwith  the  Red  Guards.)  On duly 5th the Bureau is authorised to  announce thatstatements  appearing in foreign newspapers of the movement  of  considerable forcesof foreign troops to the  M arm an and East coasts are unfounded, as also are statementsthat the Finnish Government has ordered  English subjects to leave the country.  SirE&apos;. Howard reports on July 7th  declarations by the Helsingfors Hufvudstadsbladet (inprobably inspired  articles) that  there  is  no desire in Finland, to abandon  neutrality.&quot; There is no real  ground for conflict.   The question of petshenga is exclusively aFinnish-Russian matter, and  Finland has  not acted aggressively even in this question,since no Finnish troops have traversed the boundary,  irredentist views have no support in public opinion  as a  whole.  Measures in Eastern Karelia are purely defensive, toprotect the  Eastern frontier.  Responsibility for ill-feeling lies  with  foreign  corre-spondents who spread sensational rumours  about Finnish military expeditions to theEast and North.   Finlambs friendly relations with Germany are not denied, but thesecannot be considered as a departure from neutrality.&quot;  On. the whole it seems clear-that the Finnish Government is relying on  German,  military support  to  carry out a pro-German policy against  the wishes of the people and the Army,  who are strongly opposed to war with the Allies.  Sir E. Howard suggests, on good  authority,  that a friendly pronouncement by the Allies regarding petshenga, coupled with a renewedoffer of supplies, conditional  upon the removal of German troops and the maintenanceof real neutrality,  would have important effects.   - A Russian newspaper  of June 28th reports that a Swedish company has  applied for a 62 years&apos; concession to construct  a canal  from the Lake of Onega to the WhiteSea, and. to obtain numerous exclusive rights  in various districts of the ArchangelGovernment.    Argentine  Republic and Finland. A message of July  5th- from  Helsingforsreports the recognition  by the Argentine Government of Finnish independence.                                    MENIGO.    Position of ike carranza  Government. -Mr. Thurstan reports  the  danger  ofanarchy  resulting from a  possible  break-up  of  Carraiiza&apos;s  party  owing   to  theunpopularity of its leader and the depletion of  the Treasury, which is now unable  to-pay either  the  troops  or  the  Government employes.   Should  the Germans find themselves unable to make successful use  of Carranza,  they Avould be ready to promotesuch  anarchy,  as  being  detrimental  to the  interests both  of  Great Britain andthe United  States.     There are indications  that  Oarranza  might still  be madeto appreciate the preferability of adopting an attitude friendly towards the associated powers.   It  is now essential, that  a  definite  policy  should be  decided  regardingrecognition or otherwise of the present Mexican administration.    Arrival of Wheat and, Saltpetre. Mr. Thurstan reports the arrival, at Salina Cruzof the Chilean S.S. Latauro (see Report No. 73), with a cargo of wheat and saltpetre.                                NETHERLANDS.    Flections. Sir W. Townley reports  that the Dutch  elections ended on July 4th,and appear to have resulted in a tie, the Catholics and Socialists  both having gainedconsiderably at the expense of  the Liberals.  The Cabinet  formally  tendered itsresignation  and was requested to continue its functions.  It cannot yet be foreseenwhat elements Avill compose any  new Cabinet, but  it is  believed  that the Right may/be summoned  to  power,  and that  the Administration  may  have somewhat strongpro-German  proclivities.   Mention is made of Mr. Colijn, who is a strong militarist.It is stated the  Catholics would co-operate with him, provided armaments should notbe increased beyond wdiat is  necessary for the maintenance of Dutch independence,and that he  should, not  take  charge  of  Foreign Affairs.  The Daily  Review  ofJuly  Stli reports  :-&quot; Whilst the  Telegraaf, the Tyd&apos; and the Standaard  agree in the
-view  that  there  is a  tie between  the  Right  and Left in  the  new Chamber,  theNieuws van den.  Dag  regards 54 successful candidates  as belonging to  the  flightand 46 to the Left,  whilst the Liberal Handelsblad, also bracketing the ChristianSocialists  with the  parties of the  Right,  gives the  majority- to  the  Right,  andconcludes  that  in any  case the  electors have unmistakably  decided  that  they&apos;preferred  a  Right  to  a  Left Government,  and  that  the  only  choice  can  be between a  Right and a  Coalition  Ministry.   The  facts  seem  to  be  that  severalminor parties, with  one seat only, cannot with any great certainty be  marked asLeft or Right, being  in no way to  be depended upon, so that, even if all these seatsbe ascribed to the Left, making the numbers equal, the Left by no  means presents sosolid a front as the Right.   There are 17 parties  represented in the  new Parliament,as compared with seven  in the last.  Whilst the Socialists are elated at their success in-Rotterdam, where  they  secured  nearly half  the votes cast, Amsterdam is a great disappointment  to them.  M. Troelstra was elected at Amsterdam and  Leeuwarcleu,and  the Finance Minister,  Dr.  Treub, was  elected  at  three  places.  The  paperscalculate that 1,340,122 - electors, or 85  per cent, of  the 1,516,720 electors, actuallywent to the poll under the new compulsory voting system.  Part of the remaining;.12 per cent, is accounted for by the fact that a  large part of  the Arm)- was unable toget to the poll.  The  first  and  only  woman  member  of  the  Dutch  Parliament;Mademoiselle  Snze  Groeneweg, is  an active member of the governing  body of  theSocialist Party.&quot;     Convoy to Dutch, East  Indies : British Concession : German Propaganda. Inview of explanations  offered  by the Netherlands Government regarding various points raised by  His Majesty&apos;s Government (see  Report No 75  and Reports  quoted),  (heobjections raised by His-: Majesty.&apos;s Government to the sailing of the Dutch. East Indianconvoy have been waived, on the clear understanding that the case  does not constitute a precedent.   According  to  a  Hague message, the  convoy sailed  at  5.-30 a.m. onJuly 5th.   German Wireless of July 6th  observes : &quot; The Easier Nachrichten ofJune 4th reports the statement of  the Minister of the Netherlands on the conflict with england  and writes: &apos; In  other words, Holland is  helpless in the face of  Britishsea power, and must either give in  or renounce  her colonies !  But when the european war is ended  it will  be the main task of the seafaring neutrals to  establish the rightof convoy hitherto always disputed by England, and to see to it that neutral merchant ships, convoyed  by  men-of-war, whose commander will  guarantee the  absence of contraband in the cargoes, shall be protected from search and from being towed  intoport by the warships&apos;of a  belligerent power.   Without  a  guarantee of  the  right of convoy on the one side and protection of  neutral shipping from  submarines  on theother  side, there is  no freedom of the seas !   And  it seems that this is America&apos;swar aim as well  as Germany&apos;s.&apos; &quot;   German Wireless  of July 4th commiserates withHolland upon the various acts of violence by which England robs  her of the freedomof the seas.   (The  correspondence in  this matter has been published  as a  white paper [Cd. 9028],)     Limburg  Railways. Sir W. Townley reports that the Ministers of the associated governments  issued on July 5th  a brief  reply to the public  announcement of theNetherlands Foreign Minister regarding traffic  over the Limburg Railways (see ReportNo. 75  and  Reports cited).  It was  pointed  out that, while the  Associated Govern-ments, animated by a spirit of sincere sympathy and  true  conciliation, had, whilstmaintaining unchanged the point of view they  had always defended  upon the subjectof transit of sand and gravel, consented  to release the Netherlands Government from certain engagements made with them on that  subject, there was  never  any question of their considering any concessions concerning the transit over the Limburg Railways of what  they  considered to be  military  supplies.  Sir W. Townley  learns  that anticipation of trouble with the Entente upon  this question was one  of  the causes of the proffered  resignation of the Cabinet.      German-inspired Protests against alleged, Violation of Dutch, Neutrality by British- Aircraft. As anticipated (see Report No.  75, last  paragraph), articles have  now- appeared in the  Nieuwe liotterclamsclie Gourant and  Handelsblad protesting,  though in milder  terms  than the Germans  desired, against the violation of  Dutch neutrality by British aircraft.   The  articles have been followed by an official statement dated July 7th announcing that a protest is  being made in London regarding  the  dropping of a bomb (alleged to be of British make) at Sluis on the night of June llth-12th.
    Exporti? to  Germany. The Foreign Office has  instructed. Sir  W.  Townley  to protest to the Netherlands Government against the proposed export of bone-grease  toGermany, and to point out  that such export  may affect the importation of  oils and fats into Holland. .. Very considerable exports  of potatoes, jam, sugar, condensed  milk,and  eggs  continue, and,  in addition,  large exports  of horses,  cattle, fruit,  and vegetables are anticipated.   The  Foreign Office instructs  Lord Reading  that theexistence of this surplus of foodstuffs  appears to obviate the  necessity for  any con-,cessions in the way of  similar imports.   It is  pointed  out that the Dutch decline  toenter into  an  agreement with the  Allies, but  are conceding to Germany everythingwhich the Dutch delegates  formally agreed to  restrict or prohibit.   The maintenanceof the general embargo is therefore important.                                     PERU.    British Special Mission. A Press message of July 6th from La Paz, reports the departure of the British Special Mission from Bolivia for Peru.                                     SPAIN.    General Situation. A Memorandum (G.T. 5015) dated  June 27th, discusses thepresent situation in Spain.  The Administration though  including four ex-PrimeMinisters, and representatives of three groups of Liberals and two of Conservatives,as well as of the Regionalists, who  belong  to  neither is still in  being,  and hasalready dealt with three of the  four subjects which it was designed to settle, namely,the amnesty for political offences, the  army reforms, and the  reform,  of procedure  inParliament.  The Badge!: remains ;  it is believed  that Cain bo,  the Regionalist leader,desires this to be drawn  on a  scale much more ambitious  than  that proposed  byBesada, the  Finance  Minister, who  is supported by  his leader  Dato ;  possiblyfor this reason  the  matter will  be  postponed,  till,  the   autumn.   The  criticisms of the small but able  opposition, have  been directed against (1)  the  incompetence,jobbery,  and  active  and  passive  pro-Germanism,  of  the  whole  administrationof  Spanish  Morocco,  (2)  the weakness  of successive   Governments   in. dealingwith  German  propaganda  and  espionage,  and,  above   ail,  in  the  matter  of protecting Spanish  shipping  from  submarine   outrages,  and   (H)  the  handling of the revolutionary  strike  last August.  The debates  on this  last  point discloseda lack of unanimity  between the Conservative and Liberal Sections  of the Coalition(see  Report  No.    ).  Nevertheless, there  are  reasons which  make  a,  split in the coalition improbable.   (1)  For  the  Conservatives  it would  mean the bankruptcy  ofthe Monarchical Parliamentary regime.  (2)  For the wiser heads among the Republicansit  wordd  mean the  clanger   of  a  military dictatorship ;  for of  the  four extra-constitutional forces,  the  Republicans, the Regionalists, the Church  and  the Army,the last is the only one which can act in a moment with irresistible force.   forces which tend to be  inimical to the Allies  are the  Army and the  Church, the  formerlargely on account of  allied pronouncements  for democracy and against  militarism,the latter through its  inevitable prejudice against the  Protestantism of England and america, the anti-Vaticanism of Italy,  and the anti-Clericalism of Republican  France.On. the Allies side are the  ideas that must be victorious (and these can only come fromthe pro-Ally Left), and the facts that cannot for ever be concealed, such as the presentand future economic dependence of Spain upon friendship with  the Western Powersand America.   Germany  can,  and  does,  intimidate  Spain :  a greater  and  more immediate power both to  help  and to harm her rests potentially with  the Allies. (and see next paragraph.)     Espionage Bill. The Spanish Press reports  that on duly 1st  the Cabinet approved a scheme presented by  Senor Dato  &quot; for the repression  of  espionage and  for active measures  to be  taken against  any  action  contrary  to Spanish neutrality.&quot;  TheEspionage- Bill was introduced into the Senate on July 3rd,  and  unanimously passedwithout discussion (for the text see  the Daily Review of July 8th).  A Madrid message of July 7th states : &quot; The Chamber  has passed the  Espionage Bill without a vote
owing to the withdrawal from  the  House of the  Socialist  and Republican Deputies,who opposed the measure.&quot;  The purpose  of the Bill, as declared by  Seuor Dato,is &quot; not to gag  the  Press, but only  to prevent the use of insolent language by certainnewspapers, which have  been  insulting the  chiefs  of Foreign  States.&quot;  .   .  .&quot;It is intended to suppress foreign  intrusion  into our  internal  politics.&quot;   CountRomanones  has announced that the Bill had been  unanimously  approved  by theCabinet:  &quot; Ever since 1914 such a measxire was necessary, but no Government feltitself strong enough  to  take  the necessary action.&quot;   The Bill has been publiclydescribed by Senor Castroviedo as &quot; frankly pro-German, forced  upon the  puerileSpanish Government  by the German Ambassador.&quot;  Members of the Lett protestedin the Chamber that it  was &quot; a liindenburg Bill.&quot;  The Liberal says  : &quot; The finalimpression is that Deputies are  of the general opinion that the fall of the  Cabinet willoccur  as  soon  as  the Bill  is adopted.&quot;  El Sol considers that the adoption of themeasure will place in a position of grave danger not only the life of the Ministry, butalso the public peace.

The Consul-General at Geneva, who is Cousul-General for  the  whole  of Switzerland, will thus remain ;  and  it  is  probable that russian subjects in Switzerland  of non-Bolshevist views will be able to apply to himinstead of to the Maximalist Mission for protection.
