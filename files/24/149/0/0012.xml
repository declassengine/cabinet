before the German public.  All destruction by U-boats of shipping and raw materialsmust prolong the distress caused  by a  world shortage, and  this  aspect  of  theirsubmarine warfare may in time be realised.     Some interesting matter bearing upon the attitude of the Kings of Bavaria andof Saxon j/ will.be found under &quot; Peace Discussions.&quot;                               NEUTRAL  COUNTRIES.     Denmark (page S). Following upon the meeting of Scandinavian Kings, there isto be a large congress at Copenhagen of editors of Scandinavian newspapers, said tobe promoted in German interests.   It seems probable, however, that  the &quot; strategicsense&quot; of the Scandinavian  peoples will  teach them  that  their  interests  are nowmenaced  far more seriously by Germany than  they  were once thought  to be by russia.     Finland (page 9). German economic penetration continues.  The Diet has notyet pronounced upon the constitutional question.     Netherlands (page 10). ddie  new Government has  prohibited the export from holland of all descriptions of foodstuffs.     Spam (page 11). The  controversy  with. Germany on&apos; the  shipping  questioncannot be &quot; appreciated &quot; at  its present  stage.  As far as can be  gathered from  theavailable material, Germany would like to keep Spain out of the war,  while the Allieshave no wish to bring her  into it, as no advantages  would be likely to result for  theAllied cause.     Sweden (page 11). ddie United States have protested against Sweden&apos;s breach ofthe London Agreement,  and the British, French  and Italian Ministers are likely tosupport the  protest.     Switzerland. (page  12). Attention is called  to the report that, if  the presentSoviet Government collapses  in Russia, Switzerland may become the headquarters ofLenin&apos;s Bolshevist activities.

PART  XL-FOREIGN  AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.     Sinkings. According to  the War Trade  Intelligence Bureau,  the total tonnageof 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in the  case of sailing-ships, reported lost  owing to  the  malice  of  the King&apos;s enemies during the period.September 13th-19th  inclusive, was 51,457 tons gross, of which  43,831 were British,as compared  with 41,363 tons gross, of  which  35,319 were British, reported lastweek.     Seamen&apos;s Wages. A Memorandum (G.T. 5728,  dated September 18th) by  theChairman of the National Maritime Board  draws  attention  to the  claims of Britishseamen for higher  wages, consequent  upon a  recent big advance  in  the pay  of american seamen.   It is suggested for consideration whether  (a) a specific war zonebonus should be given to British seamen of all ranks, the  national  standard rates of pay  remaining as  determined by the National Mardtime Board, (6) a reserve of  naval ratings should be established in American  ports  to furnish  substitutes for desertersenticed from British ships by the prospect of the higher American wage.     Emphasis  is  laid on the  possible-reaction  upon  shore wages  of any further advance in seameibs pay as such.     German Devastation of Occupied Territory. A  Memorandum (G.T. 5724,  dated september 18th) records the intention of the French Government to collect evidenceregarding German atrocities and systematic destruction in the occupied territory ofFrance.  The French Government submits  the desirability of a joint Allied declarationhaving  as its  object  the punishment  of   and reparation  for  these crimes.  Thissuggestion may be  distinguished  from a  proposal for immediate  reprisals,  which lord Derby  reports  to  have been  unofficially placed before   the Chamber  of deputies.     Coal  Situation. A.   Memorandum (G.T. 5737,  dated September 16th) by  SirAdam Nimmo, strongly advocates the immediate return of  men from the forces to the mines as the only solution of the coal  problem (see also Reports Nos. 80, 81, 83,  84and  86, and under &quot; France &quot;).  German Wireless of September 24th enlarges on the gravity-of the coal crisis as disclosed by the British Press.     Detention  by Germans of British Army Chaplains and Medical Personnel. ddieForeign Office has transmitted through, the  Netherlands Government a strong protestto the  German Government against the  detention,  on the ground  of reprisals, ofBritish Army chaplains and medical personnel, contrary to the Geneva Convention.                                ALLIED  GROUP.                                    BRAZIL.    British Ambassador to Brazil. ddie King having been pleased to raise the status of his Diplomatic Mission in Brazil from a Legation to an Embassy, has appointed ashis Envoy Extraordinary and Ambassador  Plenipotentiary at Rio dedaneiro Sir RalphSpencer Paget, K.C.M.G., C.V.O., now His  Majesty&apos;s Envoy Extraordinary and minister at Copenhagen.   (And see Reports Nos. 08 and 79.)    Note to Austria-Hungary. ddie  Foreign Office learns  that, as the result of an intimation  from  the  United  States  Government  that the  continued  residence  of austrian representatives  in Brazil would constitute a public clanger, the  brazilian government has addressed a Note to  the  Austro-Hungarian Government announcingits determination&apos; upon naval co-operation with the  Allies for the purpose of  securingthe greater  effectiveness  of  the  blockade,   The  Brazilian  Government  has  also recognised the independence of Poland.   So  far the Austro-Hungarian Governmenthas taken no notice of  either of  these measures, which wrere cafculated to draw from it a declaration of  war, and it is  thought  that in the absence  of a  reply  to the note the Brazilian Government will itself shortly publish such a declaration.
CHINA.     North and South. Sir J. Jordan lias taken occasion to mention to the Japanese Charge dAifaires his views as to the  necessity of  a  joint Allied effort to reconcile North and  South in China,  (see  Reports  Nos. 85 and 86).   The Japanese  Charge d&apos;Affaires, wdio  stated  that he had himself spoken  to the  new President upon the nudesirability of prolonging the present dissensions, has communicated Sir J. Jordan&apos;s views to Tokyo.  He observed to Sir J. Jordan that a settlement was  unlikely so long as Tuan Chijui remained Premier, as  his policy of coercing the South&apos; bad  become impossible.  Sir J. Jordan pointed out that the existence of two  Parliaments  was the main difficulty ,  that  both would probably have  to be dissolved,, and  a new one elected on an agreed franchise.                                     CUBA.     Gift to British Red Cross. -Mr. Cowan reports that the Cuban Committee (which on June  14th telegraphed  40,000 dollars to the  British Red Cross) has  now sent (September 14th) a further 25,000 dollars for disabled soldiers.  Mr. Cowan has been -authorised to express the  thanks of His Majesty&apos;s Government.                                    FRANCE. ,     Goal Output in Pas de  Calais and  Departeinenb Du   Nord. It  is  estimated (M.T. 6 B., No. 724) that so far as the immediate  future is  concerned, as a result of the improved, military situation, there wdll be a progressive increase in the output of Bethune, Noeux, Bruay  and  Maries  up to, and  perhaps beyond, the maximum  of 40,000 t&quot;ons per  day so far  attained under war conditions ; it is, however, impossible to hold out any  prospect that the production of the  Lens area will reach, for several years to come, any figure at all comparable with the pre-war output.  (And see under &quot;General.&quot;)                                     ITALY.      Declaration regarding  Jugo-Slavs. The  following statement  was  issued  on September 25th by the Balian Government: &quot; In conformity wdth  the  decision reached  at  the Cabinet Council  on the 8th instant, the  Italian Government has informed the Allies that it considers the  movement of the Jugo-Slav peoples for the acquisition of their independence and for their constitution in  a free state as being&apos; in harmony with the principles  for which the Allies are fighting, as  well as  with the aims of a just and durable peace.      &quot; The Allied Governments  have replied  that  they note with  satisfaction the declaration of the Italian Government.&quot;  (And sec Report No. 86.)      Economic  Oidlook. In  an interview with a  Press correspondent,  Signor  Nitti, Italian Minister  of the  Treasury, stated  that as a  result of  his visit  to  London and Paris,  and the  financial arrangements  concluded between Italy  and her Allies,  it would now be possible to  establish a single  front  in finance, and. to  stabilise the Italian exchange.  He regarded the economic outlook  for Italy as good ;  in spite of war losses  Italy would find herself, in  consequence  of the cessation of emigration. with more men than if there  had been  no war.   Her revenue for the financial year,. 1917-18 reached 260,000,000/., which represents an increase  of over 160,000,00OZ. on. the year .1.913-14.  No  extra debt is incurred by  the State  in  respect of interest charges, as provision is made for them by taxation,  ddie total of Italian expenditure during the four  years of  war amounts to 2,348,600,000L, of which 1,860,000,OOOL was for military purposes.                                       JAPAN.      Designation of Terauchi  Cabinet: Sir 0. Greene reports that on September 21st, Count  Terauchi  presented  the formal  resignation of himself  and  his  Cabinet. Pending the appointment  of  a  successor he has been commanded to carry on the administration.   The Marquis Saionji has been summoned to form a Ministry,  but  is reserving his decision.  (And see Report No. 86.)     Japanese  Pan-Asiaticism. An.  important   Memorandum   (G.T.   5713,   dated September 16th), by the P.I.D., illustrates the  Japanese conception of Pan-Asiaticism,
both in its extreme ideals and its more practical manifestations. .  ddre claim, expressed.is some  quarters, to support  the  interests of  Turkey at the  Peace Conference  isnoticed ;  as also are the various indications of a desire to increase Japanese influence in the  direction of British,&apos; American, French and  Dutch  possessions.   Of  more-immediate significance  is the penetration, financial, commercial and even military,  ofChina:    The  statements   of  various  prominent  Japanese   writers  are  quoted,evidencing that the subject  admits of frank discussion and criticism.   (See also ReportNo. 84 and next paragraph.)&apos;     Refutation by United  States  of German Propaganda.- Iu  reference to  german propaganda (see Report No. 84)  regarding British-American designs against Japan,Mr.  Lansing  has, according  to  a  Press report, issued  the  following statement : &quot; The reports which are being circulated  in Europe to the effect that a secret treatyhas  been signed  by Great Britain and  the  United States concerning Japan are whollyuntrue, and  constitute only another  evidence  of the  falsity of  German propaganda,the object of  which is  plainly to create dissension among Germ any&apos;s enemies,   ddieeffort will be  as futile as it  is  clumsy.  The United States has never made, and  neverwill make, a secret treaty.&quot;                                       SIAM.      British Prospecting Licences. Sir II.  Dering reports  that recent applications  byBritish companies  to prospect in Siam for oil, coal and  tin have been  consistentlyrefused hy the Siamese Government.   He  submits that in order to prevent British.interests  being prejudiced  it  may be  desirable to make immediate representationsunder existing Treaty rights.ENEMY&quot; GPvOUP.                             AUSTRIA -HUN GARY.    Economic Conditions. The Foreign Office learns that the potato crop in Galicia,Northern Hungary, and South Russian Poland has been completely spoiled by heavyrain.   Owing to the growing demoralisation in Austria-Hungary, no  attention is paidto regulations and ordinances.  The peasants  steal their own crops during the night and  sell them  to  the Jews,  who  retail  them  to  the -rich.   The peasants  thencomplain to the police that their crops have been stolen.                                   GERMANY.    Prospective Constitutional Expedients. ddre Foreign Office  is informed  that thefirst steps towards the projected pseuclo-deniocratisation  of Germany  (see ReportNo. 86) are likely to be  (1) the appointment of  a  new Chancellor,  e.g., Solf, (2) thepassing  of the  Electoral Reform Bill (see Reports Nos. 79 and 85), and probably(3) a proclamation  according  autonomy to  Alsace-Lorraine  within the limits of theGerman Empire.   It appears to be  thought in German diplomatic  circles that these changes will serve  as the basis of an  irresistible  peace offensive, which will  result inthe  preservation  of the Empire  and  the  Government,   ddie Leipsiger Tageblattpublishes  a report from  Berlin  that  the Government  crisis  is   approachinga decisive  point.   &quot; ddie  Majority  Parties are  determined  to  take  immediate-steps   for   the   formation  of  parliamentary  government,   whose  policy   willbe free from  interference  by General  Headquarters.  The  Social Democrats haveexpressed  their readiness to join  the new Government on the following conditions : (1) abolition  of certain paragraphs in the constitution, (2) admission  of at least two  orthree Social  Democrats to the Government, (3) appointment of a  Social Democrat toan important  political  Department.&quot;   ddie paper declares that  Hertling  will besucceeded by Count Rantzau, now Minister at Copenhagen,  ddie Vossische  Zeitung,while crediting the above report, considers that the position is not quite  so  definite ;..it denies that Rantzau  is the  most favoured candidate  for the Chancellorship, butagrees that  he is  not adverse to parliamentary government and that his selection ispossible.  Other reported aspirants are  Bernstorff, who is declared to have  become aconvert to Liberal  opinions, and Felirenbach, Avho is said to have  the support of bothCentre and  Liberals; nevertheless  the  informant in  this  case  (a  German  writer ofddberal views) is  convinced  that  Solf will be appointed, and asserts that  he  is
supported by the majority of the Reichstag, the Intellectuals, and the Hamburg ship-owners;  in addition to which he is regarded as advocating reconciliation with  England,so that his appointment would be a serious blow to the Pan-Germans.     According to one report, the few consistent opponents of intensified submarine warfare are now rapidly gaining adherents and will gather round them an influentialparty, which, recruited from other parties aud probably led by Erzberger,  will take its place between the Centre  and the Socialists and  endeavour to obtain  peace for -Germany this year.  This party would  be, or professes  to  be,* prepared to promotegenuine  and drastic constitutional  changes  with  a view  to  satisfying  the  Allies&apos;insistence that peace can only be discussed with the German people direct.     Sir H. Rumbold learns  that an  important Socialist meeting has lately been heldat Munich, to which German Socialists, who have for some time  been residing  inSwitzerland,  were summoned.     A  Swedish  Lecture  on  Germany. A  Swedish  writer  of some  prominence,Gustaf Sjoesteen, Berlin correspondent of Gbteborgs Handelstidning for four  years,and  hitherto pro-Germau, delivered on September 17th, before a crowded audience  atGothenburg,  a lecture (which he will probably repeat in Stockholm) on the present state of  Germany.  He  had previously  written  to his paper, declaring that his original belief in a German  &quot; war of defence &quot; had  been  changed to a firm conviction that Germany&apos;s  aim was conquest.   In diis lecture he stated that the recent Germanreverses were  clue  to  the  under-nourishment  of  the men, and  to  miscalculationregarding Foclds reserves.  The Allies were  masters in the air.  The Germans hadscraped together their last reserves,  and emptied the prisoners  into the army.  the speaker had himself seen hunchbacks and cripples  in uniform.   Crime  in  Germany .wras enormously on the increase, and the  spirit of the soldiers was at a low  ebb :desertion vras rampant, and the word &quot; revolution &quot; was  spoken openly -though the speaker was  sceptical as to the likelihood  of  a revolution.   Hindenburg  was nowreviled as much as he was formerly idolised, and most Germans would be ready toabandon conquests in the East and compromise on the Alsace-Lorraine question. TheGerman talk of a record harvest last autumn was a pose.   This year  the potato cropwas bad, the crops in Rumania were a failure, and the Ukraine had little to spare.     Removal of llelfjerich. German Wireless of  September 24-th  reports :  &quot; TheMinister of State, lieltferich, has been relieved of his post as diplomatic representativeof the German Empire to the Soviet Republic, and is resuming his former  activitiesof concentrating  economic preparations for the transition period.&quot;     Economic Developments  and Discussions. The Admiralty  reports : -Now thatthe  hopes of  a rapid commercial advance in the East have  died away, the economicoutlook for Gfermany is blacker than ever before.  Her great chance lay in  restockingherself  with  Russian and Central  Asian raw materials  before the general peace, sothat she  might  have  something with which to keep her  manufacturing  industriesalive and able to compete  in world markets during  the period  of transition.  Butassistance from Russia on a large scale is now seen  to be  out of the question.   Theother hope that the exclusion  of  Germany from competition for the possession  ofraw material would be opposed  by influential circles  in Allied  countries is also being abandoned.   It is recognised  that American opinion grows more resolved everyday to use every possible weapon for  the destruction of  Prussian  militarism, and as for  England, the only considerable  exception, according to  the Vossische Zeitung, tothe  chorus of assent is the  Manchester Guardian.  A writer in the  same paper  states the  situation as follows : A large part of the raw materials which Germany did  notimport  from  the  British Empire before the war  she imported from  America ; and  theneed in Germany for  British  and American raw  material is far greater than  theBritish  desire for  a definite period.  It is sometimes argued  that England  needscertain German products, e.g., potash, zinc, dyes, sugar, and potatoes.  But  at presentEngland is able  to produce all-these herself or get them from  other countries.  Dyesand potash are certainly German3&apos;&apos;s most  powerful weapon (see Report Ho.  84) ;  but even if she refuses to export them to England, how can she guarantee that a proportionof the quantities which wdll have to be exported to neutral countries to restore german trade will not  reach  England ?  The writer concludes  that Germany possesses  nocounter weapon at all.  She will be completely at  the mercy of the Allies unless (1) she can impose upon them, by driving a  bargain over Belgium and Northern  Eranceat the Peace Conference, a  scheme  for the  international control  and  distribution  of     6405-4i                              B
raw materials to all nations without discrimination ;  and (2) she can ally herself with china,  Japan, Spain, Mexico and those  South American countries that have  notentered the war.   A  German-Mexican Society was founded in July 1918 with a viewto a future commercial entente (see Report No. 77).    British  reconstruction plans are being watched  with  keen  and apprehensiveinterest.  The Non-Ferrous  Metals Act, the Anglo-Australian Zinc Agreement,  theexport  duties on  palm-kernels, the Indian jute monopoly, the control  of eygptian cotton,  and  the control of Australian and South African wool have been carefullynoted ;  and,  in the words of the Vossische Zeitung, &quot;  England, has woven a net ofeconomic contracts which  will paralyse, if not render impossible,  our textile,  fat,electrical, metal, cable, automobile, rubber, leather, jute, soap, oil and vegetable fatindustries ; and where this is not sufficient a system of export duties will be devised which  will  make competition impossible.   Germany  will become,  economically,  a mere   vassal,  of   England.&quot;    ddie  German Government  is  doing  its  utmost byorganisation and  propaganda to prepare  the  nation for  tire  coming straggle,  ddiemost recent developments of importance are as follows :-     1.  The  Conference at Salzburg betioeen German and Auslro-Tlungarian Jlepre-sentatives on Economic Co-operation. Although no  one in Germany believes that  a central-European  economic bloc will be an adequate substitute for a participation in world-markets, yet the Germans are  anxious to have  a second string  to their bow.A customs union between Germany and Austria-Hungary would be  equally unpopularin  both countries ;  but the intention  apparently  is that  during the  transition period  the two Allies  shall act together.   The economic future of  Germany  depends on the  peace terms she can by hard  bargabiing extort; and Mittel-Europa is to be  a stand-by and a precaution  in  case  the peace  terms  do  not  include the right for germany of equal trading,  ddie preliminary  sittings produced  no decision.  the austrians are unwilling  to  commit  themselves  too  far  while the  Polish, questionremains unsettled.  Germany is believed  to have pmposed a  customs  union, whichthe Austrians refused ;  al  they would agree to were certain  preferential tariffs.  Itwas then suggested that the duties on agricultural produce should be abolished ;  butthe  Hungarians   intervened.   Any  proposal to allow  free  trade   in  agricultural produce would  be unpopular in Hungary,  whose  prosperity depends  largely on her  export  of   cereals.    In  connection  with these  negotiations  a   &quot;  german economic Council for Central Europe &quot; has been established  wdth the object (in plainlanguage) of exploiting  Eastern Europe so thoroughly as to make it impossible on.business grounds  for  the enemies of  Germany to exclude her from  the markets of theworld.   1.1 err Ballin, of the Ham burg-Amerika Line, was  elected  chairman,  butresigned shortly afterwards. The whole project was  distasteful to him as incompatible with the concentration of all available resources on development overseas.    2.  Development of Trade with Finland  and the Eastern  occupied Territories. The necessary committees  are  being set  up to  study possibilities.  The HamburgChamber of Commerce  is sending  a special  commission  to Lithuania, Courland,Livonia and  Esthonia.  Shipping traffic has  been resumed  between Germany  and finland, the cargoes  carried  being iron, coal and sugar,  ddie first  vessel to fly theFinnish flag (a blue cross on a white  Background) was  expected at Flensburg late inAugust.  The Hamburger  Fremdenblait states that 45  Finnish  sailing vessels  and live steamers are  to  be  released from German ports.   Finnish foreign  trade is  wellunder German control (see under &quot; Finland &quot;).     3. Penetration  in  Neutral  Countries and Efforts  to  bespeak  the  Servicesof Neutral  Firms. The latest examples of this  policy which  is being  steadilyfollowed are to  be  found in the refusal  of certain  German firms to  supply Swissfirms  unless  the  latter undertake to  continue trading with them  for  three yearsafter the war;  in reported,  attempts to buy up shares  in  the  Norwegian  NorskeAmerika Linje ;  and in another attempt, reported  in the Dutch Press, to  hireCargo  space for  a   period  of four  months   after  the  war ;   and in the  termsconditioning the  supply of shipbuilding  materials  to neutral yards,  ddie  Swedish General  Export  Association  was  recently  asked by  German  agents to induceits members to  act  as cloaks  and  intermediaries  for German merchants wishing  to establish trade wdth the Entente after the war.   ddre Banco Aleman  at Barcelona  is reported to have received instructions to arrange for  the purchase, as soon as peace negotiations are opened, of  all foodstuffs  and raw  materials as are  not obtainable  in
Germany,  Russia,  or Scandinavia.   It  is  stated  that  a German... shipping  hank,supposed to he backed  by Herr Thyssen, the iron  magnate, is to be established at rotterdam ; and there is another rumour that  Dutch yards are  to be directly com-missioned  to  build  German ships, and to be supplied with material for  that specificpurpose.     The process, however, of commercial xoenetration in neutral countries  is hampered by the fact that the one thing Germany is able to offer in exchange, i.e., money,  is notrequired in those countries.  What is and will be required are raw materials, whichthe neutrals know can only be obtained from  the Allies.  In Sweden, to take a singleinstance, public opinion is  growing  increasingly hostile to German  penetration, on grounds of interest as well as sentiment.   -  -1.  Vigorous Propaganda in  favour  of the Restoration of German  Colonies. The threatened raw  material boycott  has immeasurably strengthened the hands ofthe colonial propagandists,  who argue that  in  face of the danger of an InteralliedReconstruction Programme, Germany will have to rely entirely on her  colonies forher  supply of cotton, palm-kernels and copra.  The new situation has, in the words of the  Norddeutsche  Allgemeine Zeitung, brought  home  the necessity   of colonial possessions to thousands of  German workers who have hitherto been indifferent.     5.  Organisation. It is known  that  the Government  intend, in spite of theprotests of the Hamburg shipowners, to establish a drastic control of imports  from overseas in order to eliminate competition between German biwers.  A  syndicate isto be formed of some 50  commercial firms which will take over the purchase  of allkinds of colonial produce and arrange for  their  distribution among the various  firms.No other firm, not even those which before the war had direct business relations withforeign countries, will be able to purchase anything whatever directly from,  overseas.This will mean the virtual ruin of the smaller industries ; but that cannot be. helped.It is probable that Government-controlled monopolies will be  established for eachcommodity and for tonnage.  The bodies so established will be nominally independent,but will remain under Government supervision.  They will work  in close touch withthe Reichsbank over questions of foreign exchange.   In the case of the textile  trade,for  example,  the importer,  the  scunner,  the weaver,  the  wholesale  dealer and the retail dealer with all be  members of one organisation, and no  one of them will beable  to act independently  of  the  Government or  of  each other (see also nextparagraph and previous  Reports passim).     German  Plans  for  AfrerAVar  Cotton Supply. M.I.  6  P. No.  722 reports:  A German treatise, written  by the head of the German  colonial school and published in 1917, deals with the problem  of the supply  of raw cotton  for Germany after thewar.  The German textile trade, now a very important industry, of course requires alarge import of raw cotton, and  practically the Avhole of the present cotton-giowingterritories  are under the  control of the British  and  Americans.   Germany  is,  itseems, very  anxious to achieve  in   the  near future some- substantial degree of independence in the matter of these supplies, the  aim  being, at  the least, to get intoa position, within a generation, to  draw not  less than  one-third of the  necessary cotton  from. German-controlled sources.  The treatise examines the problem at some length, without arriving at  any very comforting conclusion.  No cotton can, of course,be grown in Germany, and all that can be done there is  to cultivate other sources of textile fibre which to a certain  extent may act as substitutes  for cotton.  flax, forexample, might possibly be grown on an  increased scale,  and  nettles, although their successful growth demands really rich soil, could perhaps be  cultivated  to the  extentof one-third of the pre-war  cotton import.   (The author confesses bluntly that neithernettles nor any other war-time substitute textile is of any real value.)     Import being thus  unavoidable, it  is natural to turn to the German colonies,which it is assumed  are to remain  in German hands.  Here (mainly, indeed almost exclusively, in the African  colonies)  efforts to  cultivate cotton have  already a long and  by no means wholly unsuccessful history.  The  treatise, however,  gives  fairly cogent reasons  (mainly  climatic)  for  the opinion,  that  (save  on a  relatively  small scale in South-West Africa) there  is  no future for successful cotton cultivation -in any part in Africa, hitherto colonised by Germany, nor even in.the territories which it is or was hoped to incorporate in  the German Central African Empire.  Drawing the,conclusion that the  only step left  to  be  taken  is  to  find&apos;new lands capable  of growing cotton, which can  be brought under German protection (the idea of  actual colonisation is not,  it  seems, entertained),, the author shows that  the only  lands
fulfilling these couclitions are (1)  Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Cilieia, and  certain otherWest Asiatic countries,  and  (2) Northern  Africa, more  particularly  Western  (orAtlantic)  Morocco,   hi many districts  of these countries, the climate (especially therainfall)  is  such as to hold,  out  considerable encouragement, and the problem  oflabour (which  affects all the  districts equally)  is  to  be solved by importations ofindentured labourers on  a large&apos;scale ; &quot;in Asia, the cultivators are to be brought from french China, British India  (the British being  brought  by the  terms of the peace-treaty to consent to the uecessary  arrangements !). and elsewhere in Asia.     ddre prospects  in Mesopotamia, if Arery large initial  expenditure on irrigation be faced, and assuming  a sufficient supply of labour, are  stated to be hopeful, a growth of  one-third  to onedialf  of Germany&apos;s requirements  being  within the range  of possibility, and  some of -the lands in Asia Minor are also capable of showing a large increase  on the  cultivation which is already  undertaken there.  The author, however,for some reason does not seem  to  rely on these &apos;soUrces, and pays more attention tothe region of Morocco along the Atlantic coast,   Jdns country, he devotes great energyto proving, is one of  almost  unequalled natural  advantages, and. could, as a Germanprotectorate, grow enormous quantities of cotton by means of imported African labour-Apart from advantages possessed by the  country in mineral wealth and the prospects.of successful cultivation of other  crops (not to  mention its strategic  possession  inrelation to Atlantic trade routes), the cotton prospects alone, according to the treatise,render this country of the utmost importance  to Germany, and allow her to cherish&quot;substantial  hopes of  reducing very greatly her present dependence on America  and england for supplies of cotton.     It maybe  deduced, therefore, from this treatise that  the  prospects of Germanyemancipating herself in any substantial degree  from  dependence on her  presentenemies in respect of raw cotton  supplies are conditioned by her  capacity to obtainterms of peace which would be virtually those of a victorious belligerent.NEUTRAL  GROUP.                                   ALBANIA.    Italian Aspirations.- The Daily &quot;Review (A.P.S.) of September 1 8th reports: &quot; ThePerseveranza (September 2nd and 4th) discusses the question of Albanian propaganda in America and of the intrigues of Essad Pasha; it  emphasises the fact that EssadPasha puts into the  background  the part  played by Italy in Albania,  ddre author ofthese articles (L. Azzarita) notes  the declarations made by Essad Pasha &apos; to a  certainsection of the French Press, hardly to be  regarded as friendly towards Italy.&apos;  Italy has proclaimed Albanian independence under an Italian protectorate; Essad assuredlywishes to  supplant Italy in Albania, and  therefore he proposes  the union of tireAlbanians with the Serbs, Greeks, and Jugo-Slavs, and will seek to obtain a declarationfrom President Wilson to this effect.&quot;  (And see Report No.  7b.)                                     CHILE.     Change of Ministry. Sir F. Stronge reports that  the Chilian Ministry has fallen,ostensibly on account  of. the  demand  of the Labour  Party  (which is at  presentinconsiderable) to be  represented in the Cabinet, but more probably because of thedistrust felt by the moderate liberals for the Premier.  The new Government, whichis not expected to last more  than six  weeks, is believed  to be, with one exception,.pro-Ally.                                   DENMARK.     Danish-Allied Agreement. Mr. Barclay reports the signature, on September P8th,.of a  Danish-Allied Commercial  and-  Shipping  Agreement,  to  become  operative
 as from  October &quot;3rd.  The War  Trade  Intelligence Bureau, gives  the following particulars: The Agreement, which is  made  between, the United States War Trade Board and the Danish Associations, is supplemented by an exchange of notes between the War Trade Board and the Danish Minister.   The existing Anglo-Danish Shipping- Agreement is superseded by a special section of the new Agreement&quot; dealing with the allocation of tonnage to Great  Britain, wdth a  proviso that if the Danish-American Agreement should  terminate the Anglo-Danish Agreement would  again  come into force.  (1)  Supplies to Denmark. 352,895 tons per annum of  all supplies (including foodstuffs, mineral oils,  metal manufactures, cotton and cotton  manufactures, wool and  woollen manufactures, hides,  tanning materials, rubber  and. rubber  goods), rationed, and from all sources whether Allied or Neutral.  During the coming  twelve months Denmark is to receive a total of 33,333 tons of nitrates on condition that she sends to Norway and Sweden 3  tons of cereals  for every ton of fertilizers imported. The &quot;War Trade  Board  will allow bunkers to  ships  carrying  these  supplies.  The Danish Associations undertake that no such  goods shall be exported to  the  enemy or used to release or manufacture goods for the enemy.   In particular,  no  mineral  oils are to be used in factories or plants producing commodities for  the Central Empires. (2) Exports to Central Powers.  The Danish  Government agrees to  impose  an embargo on hog  and dairy products,  and  to send 30 per cent, of the Danish  surplus of butter, bacon, milk, and cheese, and 25 per cent, of  surplus  eggs  to Norway  and. Sweden, and to divide the remainder  of the surplus equally between  Germany  and the United  Kingdom.  Exports  of  these products to  Germany must  not  exceed 24,200 tons per aunum.   Other exports of Danish  produce to  the  Central Empires will include 25,000 tons of fish and fish  products (excluding  fish  oil)  per annum,; 220,000 heart of cattle per annum ; 200  tons of copper, lead,  and other  metals, in exchange for  German manufactured goods containing  proportionate  quantities  of these metals, per annum ;  2,500 horses per month.   The Danish authorities will furnish monthly  statistics of  all Danish imports and  exports  within 30 days  of their taking- place.   (3) Shipping. The Danish  Shipping  Committee will  charter  2S5,000 tons. deadweight of shipping to the U.S. Shipping Board,  and 200,000 -tons deadweight to His  Majesty&apos;s Government,  leaving 340,000 tons deadweight for  Danish services. The  War  Trade  Board  will  license  35,000  tons   of shipbuilding  material  for export to &quot;the Danish  Shipping  Committee^ and  His  Majesty&apos;s Government,  awl- will  furnish Denmark wdth 100,000 tons of coal  per month, to be  transported in Danish vessels.     Intern-Scandinavian Press  Congress. The Norwegian Press  reports that  on September  27th  and 28th there will be  a Congress in  Copenhagen of editors of Scandinavian papers,  each country sending 15 representatives.  It is possible that the question of  a  big telegram bureau for the  whole of  Scandinavia may be considered (see Reports Nos. 48,  54, 55, and 84).   One of the principal subjects for discussion will be that  of  economic co-operation between the three countries.   The Foreign Office is informed that this subject may include that of  post-bellum  shipping policy, and there is some reason to think that  the  Conference is being promoted in German interests (see  under  &quot; Germany &quot;).   The  Foreign Office learns of  a German project  for  the simultaneous publication  in  the leading papers  of various neutral  countries of an article insisting that the war  must  be  stopped unless  the whole of  Europe is to be destroyed ; the intention is that such an article, being reproduced in the Press of  the belligerent States, should  strongly affect  public opinion.  Conceivably this scheme is to be proposed to the Congress.   (See under &quot; Peace Discussions.&quot;)                                   FINLAND.    Constitution.-A Press telegram from Helsingfors to the Svenska Dagbladet statesthat the Finnish deputation just returned from Germany is very favourably impressedwdth Prince  Friedrich Kail, the future King of Finland.  The Prince  pointed outthat he was liberal in politics and moderate in his views.  The  impression of thedeputation was that he would be a perfectly loyal King.

                                    MEXICO.     Attitude of Carranza Government towards the Allies.-. Mr. Thurstan reports thatthe  French Charge d&apos;Affaires has  been instructed that bis Government  will not receive the  Mexican  Minister  designated  by  Carranza.    So  far,  he  has  notcommunicated  this  decision to the Mexican Government.   Mr.  fh install believes that  Carranza  will  not  be  disposed to  make so  much trouble about  this  as-in  the case  of the  British,  refusal  (see  Report No!  84),  as he probably  designs-to  effect a cleavage in British and  French solidarity  upon  the  Mexican  question...Be  reports, however,  that the Mexican  Charge des  Archives  at  Paris  is  being transferred  to  Chile, possibly  as a preliminary to the withdrawal of  recognition o the French representative in Mexico,   ddie United States Ambassador  in  Mexico hasbeen, summoned to  Washington to discuss  the present crisis.  Mr. Thurstan  submitsthat  the Allied Governments  might with advantage direct  their  Representatives inMexico to  proceed simultaneously  to  Washington.    ddie  mere  calling of such aconference,  whatever  its conclusions, would, in his opinion, make a moral impression.on Carranza.   The  Foreign Office authorises Mr. Barclay to  ascertain whether theUnited States Government would desire Mr. Thurstan-to visit Washington.     Projected Sale of  German Ships. Mr.  Thurstan learns  that negotiations are inprogress  for  the  sale of 1.1  German  sailing  ships  at Santa   Rosalia  and one atGuaymas.   It would seem that Americans are concerned in this transaction.     alinatiilan Refinery.--Mr. Thurstan  reports  that the  Mexican  Governmentpromised some time  ago to reinforce the garrison at  Minatitlan,  but  have  never-done so.  Any but picked troops would only aggravate the disorder.  Further reports to the Central Government tend to arouse  the hostility  of the local  Commander.  Itis doubtful  in  any case  whether attention  would be paid to  representations by IdisMajesty&apos;s Legation  (see  Report  No. 86).  Meanwhile representatives  of the  EagleCompany are endeavouring to approach Carranza personally  in the matter.                                NETHERLANDS.    Dutch-Allied Negotiations. Mr.  Robertson  reports  that  the Allied ministers at The Hague have formally notified the Netherlands Foreign Minister of the readiness of their Governments to negotiate  for  an agreement which  shall enable Holland to resume her imports for the needs of the Dutch people and to relieve Dutch  industrysubject to a limitation upon Dutch exports to Germany.   The Netherlands ForeignMinister has  intimated the earnest desire  of  his  Government that such negotiations should take place in Holland :  Mr. Robertson suggests  that  this desire is clue  to  ananxiety to convince the Dutch people that steps are being taken to remedy the serious-food  shortage :  The Foreign  Office instructs Mr.  Robertson  that  the  proposal is impracticable.   The new Government has  prohibited the  export from  Holland of  allfoodstuffs whatsoever, a measure which is generally welcomed.  The Telegraaf reports-that negotiations for the supply by Austria  of 5,000 tons of  petroleum  (see ReportNo. 85)  and a large quantity of sugar,  against  a credit in gulden, are progressingfavourably.   Mr. Robertson learns, however, that the supply of sugar from Austria isnot expected, and that wood rather than sugar is in question.  Mr. Barclay reports.that  the United States Government,  anticipating that the  Netherlands  government might throw upon the Allies the  onus of  Hollancbs  food shortage, announced to thePress on September  20th that, but for the obstruction of the Netherlands Government,the Dutch nation could have had. an agreement  guaranteeing its supplies at any time-since last January.                                   NORWAY.     German Submarines  in  Norwegian  Territorial Waters. ddie  Foreign  Officelearns that the Norwegian Government is disposed to take further action in the near-future in regard to the abuse of Norwegian territorial waters by submarines.   It is.not  yet  clear  -whether  such action  will entirely correspond  with Allied recom-men(rations.  Some  time  has  elapsed since the  Allied  Governments  assured  the-

Hardinge, sets out  a  German-inspired  article  in  the A.B.C.(regarding  the   proposed   seizure  of  German  ships) which  greatly  provokedSeiior  Dato.  The  following  passage gives  the  substance  of  the whole : &quot; we ask our readers  to  remember that Germany has  always regarded  such a seizureas a easus belli.  .   .   .  The Germans cannot possibly warn all  their submarinesat  once,  nor can  Germany agree  to  suspend  her  action  against ships  whichcarry  contraband,  since these  are  engaged  in an  unlawful trade, and  Germany,if  she   respected  men  engaged in  smuggling  under the  Spanish  flag,  wouldhave to  do  the  same  with  the ships of all other neutral  countries.  The ruptureof  relations  will therefore  rapidly come to  pass  if  we insist  upon this attitude.And this would be the beginning of war, into which we should be driven by Spanishadvocates of intervention and foreign influences.   And war would be a dishonour andthe ruin of our country, as it has been die ruin of Portugal, of Rumania, and of all theother  countries impelled in this struggle to serve interests which were not  their own.Let the Government think over this and reflect that many Spaniards will prefer civil war rather than that Spain should be told by certain Great  Powers to defend a flagwhich is not hers.&quot;   Sir A.   Hardinge is informed that this  threat of  revolution isbeing  made to  the  King  by  the  enemy  Ambassadors themselves.  Senor Datoprobably apprehends  that,  if a conflict  did arise,  the Germanopbile  spirit  in  theArmy  might again  give   trouble. to  the  National Government,  whose  formationprevented a military dictatorship under Sehor La Cierva (see Reports Nos.  59, 01 and63).  In a despatch dated September 10th, Mr. Vaughan submits that such internaldangers would not,  in the  opinion of the  Allied  Embassies, be so great as  thosewdiich might ensue  if Sehor  Dato fell.   &quot; The general impression seems to  be that thepresent Coalition Government will only hold together till the estimates  are passed the last of the four tasks allotted, to it (see Report No.  76).  What will happen if theydisintegrate it is impossible to predict, but there will be just  as  much  chance of disorder then as there would be now, and, if Spain is still sitting on the fence,  wemay possibly be  confronted  wdth a less friendly Ministry than  it is  our  good fortuneto have at present principally owing to Sehor Dato&apos;s presence  in  it.&quot;  On September22nd Mr. Vaughan  reports  that his  French colleague is still  apprehensive that a rupture, while it might be commercially beneficial to America, would be likely to entail a claim by Spain for Tangier  and Gibraltar (see Report  No. 86).  (Mr.  Vaughan&apos;despatch of September 10th mentions  that  bis French  colleague had reported to hisGovernment in terms  implying that the acceptance by Spain of  Germany&apos;s proposalto  hand over some  vessels to replace those &quot; unjustly &quot;  sunk in the  past outside  theprohibited zone might be regarded as satisfactory.)   In his despatch of August 19th.Sir A. Hardinge  reports his  belief that &quot; the Spanish Government, though it  declined to  recognise the  German &apos; prohibited zone &apos;  as one in which Spanish ships w&apos;ere liable to  be legitimately  sunk, was prepared to recognise a distinction, for the purposes of indemnisation, between  vessels notoriously  carrying contraband of  Avar to England, and others  coming from foreign ports, neutral or enemy, to Spain.&quot;   The Foreign Office  learns that  instructions  have been issued  from  Madrid for the  seizure of a German ship at  Carthagena.  (And see Reports Nos.  80-86.)                                   SWEDEN.    German Mines in the Kattegat. A telegram from Gothenburg to Dagens Nijheter,published on  September  23rd, states  that Swedish mine-sweepers  in the  Kattegathave found new anchored  German mines in the places  swept by Swedish  boats, that german war vessels are operating in  the Kattegat, and that the Germans  intend  to lay new mines as soon as the old ones have been swept up.  The same telegram statesthat Skagerak also is full of mines.   (And see Reports Nos. 69, 71,  72 and 76.)Norwegian Government  that  Norwegian waters  were not being violated  by theirsubmarines ;  no such assurance has so far been received from the German Government.(See also Reports Nos. 80-82 arid 84.)
    Swedish Breach of London Agreement,. Mr. Olive reports that on September 20ththe United States Minister presented a protest to the Swedish Government regardingthe.Swedish breach of the London Agreement,  ddre protest demanded (a) a completelist of exports from Sweden  since the date of the Agreement, (b) a list of  all out-standing commitments, and (c) copies of all Agreements with Germany concerningSwedish exports, and pointed out that pending receipt of such information and adecision thereon,  interim  exports  from the United. States to Sweden  under  theAgreement  should  not be construed as  a condonement  or waiver.  Strong criticism of the Hand els-Commission was  also  expressed.   ddre Swedish.  Foreign  minister unertook  to  give  particulars regarding (a) and (b).  As to (c) he  declared  himselfunable to make any statement, but intimated that no such Agreement was outstandingexcept the  Coal  Agreement,  which was  about to  lapse.  The Foreign Office  has instructed Mr. Clive to co-operate wdth the French and Italian Ministers in presentinga joint note on similar lines.   (And see Report No. 83d    Allied Purchases of Timber and Wood Pulp. Arrangements have been made forcentralising Allied purchases in  Sweden of timber and wood pulp.  French andBritish  representatives wdll proceed to  Copenhagen  and supervise the purchase andshipment of these  commodities for French  and British account.   They will havepower to charter the necessary shipping in consultation wdth the Swedish Shipowners&apos;Committee.  (See cdso Report No. -77.)                                SWITZERLAND.    Black List. A discussion  took  place at Berne on September 4th  regarding  the drawing up of an official joint Black List for Switzerland, by the Allied governments in collaboration  with  the Swiss  authorities.  The Swiss representative  expressedapprehension of German retaliation and the consequent ruin  of the Swiss  industries which depend on  German coal  and on German iron and  steel.  As the result of a subsequent  discussion  in  Paris, the British, French  and American  representativesapproved  the adoption of a joint list, agreed with the S.S.S.  and the Swiss Government,to be published in the Allied countries and Switzerland. Under this scheme the S.S.S.is to be  responsible for preventing imports from reaching firms upon  the  list.  TheForeign Office has instructed Mr. Erskine to urge the  Italian Government to support this settlement at the resumption of the discussion in Berne.    Bolshevism: According  to a report received  by the Foreign Office,  it  is  thedesire of Lenin, if and. when the Soviet Government collapses in Russia, to recommenceoperations in Switzerland.  (And see Reports Nos. 70, 72,  74, 82, and 83.)PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.       (N.B. Countries arc arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)     General. Peace talk  and writing has increased rapidly in volume  during thepast week.  Jn the Weekly Summary for September if 1st the Ministry of Informationprovide useful  material, for propaganda on the subject of the Vienna Peace  Note.The great enemy &quot;peace offensive,&quot; of which the Ademra Note seems to represent onlythe advanced guard, is so far conspicuous by its  bulk rather than by  any novelty inthe arguments advanced.   Count Hertling&apos;s Reichstag speech contains chiefly appealsto the justice of the German  cause, based  upon misstaternents  which have constantlybeen exposed in countries outside Germany.  Owing to absence  of evidence to support them, they may, in time, cany less weight  amongst the German people.     Austria-Hungary. According to information received from Sir H.  Rumbold(September  18th) a  diplomat from  Austria-Hungary (M. de Merey), with a highreputation for capability, has reached .Zurich, and  it is  considered that his presence
    1 German General Headquarters also appeal- to take this view.  See report under German.!/, which, is-confirmed by the prominence given by German Wireless to .VL. Sembat/s opinions.     6465-46                             0may be attributable  to  the  hope of  the Austrian Government that peace discussionsmay soon be initiated.  The prospects of  a new and move definite peace note being-issued  by Austria-Hungary are foreshadowed  in  a report from Sir  R. Rodd ofSeptember 24th.     Mr. Robertson (The Hague) reported,, from a source generally reliable (September1:9th), that the Austrian Government may be ready to accept the &quot;14 principles&quot;laid down by President  Wilson,  but only if Germany also agreed to do  so.  The sameauthority reports an  apparent  determination on  the  part of the Government to bringthe war to a conclusion  before winter sets  in.     On September 20th Sir H. Rumbold forwarded a report that the Emperor Charlesnncl the Kings of Bavaria and of Bulgaria are now  in very close relationship.   (TheKing of Bulgaria was recently in Vienna, and has since been visited  by the King ofBavaria and the King and Crown Prince of  Saxony.)   On the 18th (received 20th) heforwarded a rumour that  the Vicuna Note was  drawn up on about August 29th atEinsiedeln. and was&apos;the work of eminent Clericals.   Erzberger is said  to have beenthere.  The authorship  of the Note is also attributed (September  19th) to the King ofBavaria, who  is said to  be on  bad terms with  the Kaiser and Count Hertling.     The  Political Intelligence  Department  on  September  21st furnished a  report(G.T. 5752) on the  antecedents to the A&quot;ienna  Peace Note, drawing the deductions(1) that Austria-Hungary must have peace, and that the ruling circles feel a horror ofwhat  may happen   if   they  fail to  obtain  it ;  (2)  that  the  negotiations for  an understanding with  Germany have  broken  down, or at  least reached  once more adead point.  Reasons for these conclusions are given, and reasons for the impasse.  ,     In addition to the above official information, Press reports are very voluminous.The Enemy Press Supplement for September 19th of the General Staff Daily Review,and the same  authority  (September 24-th) contain useful precis.     Belgium. See under Germany.     Bulgaria. Has replied to the  Vienna  Note (Daily Review, September 24-th and25th).  According to information received  from  Sir H. Rumbold (September  24th)Bulgaria may announce readiness  for a  separate peace  on the basis of  the formerTreaty with Greece  and Serbia.     China. On September 20th Sir J. Jordan reported the reception  by the  DutchMinister, by telegram from the Dutch Government, of the terms of the A^ienna  Note,wdth a request from  the Austro-Hungarian Government that it may be communicatedto the Chinese Government, in  spite of its reception by the Allies, the  date of such communication to be reported.     France. On September 18th-23rd  Lord  Derby  reported  general approval inthe  French Press of M. Clemeneeaids declaration  in  the Senate upon the ViennaPeace Note.   Marcel Sembat  (Socialist Deputy) criticises the replies  of the UnitedStates and of  M.  Clemenceau,  in an article in  Rumanite, on the plea that they enablethe Central Powers to deceive their peoples, and  to  present  the Allies as implacablefighters to a finish.1   &quot;  When Switzerland transmits to the  French Government theAustrian Note, Socialists will demand that the Entente should speak  in its turn, butnot before reflection and consultation.&quot;  In an  article  in  Heure the same authoritysupports The Times&apos; proposal for a &quot; Diplomatic Versailles &quot; which could give a reply of the  Entente.   Alexandre  Varenne (another  Socialist  Deputy) advocates  telling-Germany, now that  she is in a state to listen to  it, that her interest is to cut herselfadrift  from  her leaders.   M. Herve,  in Victoire,  strongly criticises  proposals for international Socialist  Congresses  to  discuss  matters  which lie  between  theGovernments concerned.     On September  19th Lord  Derby added that the Foreign  Minister, in acknow-ledging the receipt of the Vienna Note, announced that M. ClemenceaiPs speech wasthe reply of France. .     The Admiralty  Report No.  332 gives a brief precis  of  the situation, and  draws attention to divergence of views between different Socialist groups.     Germany. The-latest phase of  a possible  German peace offensive is reported(Hague 3112) to be a scheme to  induce  the Press in neutral countries to publish
simultaneously articles  demanding the stoppage of  the  war to save Europe fromdestruction.  It w*as hoped that the Press in belligerent countries would take over thearticles, and so have a strong effect upon the opinion of the public.&apos;     Information elated&apos; September 5th has reached the Foreign Office which points  tothe  probability of Admiral von Idintze making an announcement before  long to theeffect that  the &quot;pawn&quot; theory is  renounced, and  that Germany is ready to undertake the  rebuilding of  Belgium.  A tentative offer to France about granting autonomyeither to Alsace or Lorraine is also  foreshadowed.  [If  this prediction  should be  -fulfilled, it is  unnecessary to  point out  the  advantage  to  Germany if  trusted  toundertake the rebuilding  of  Belgium.   German  industries would  profit, a claim forraw materials could  be  advanced,  and.  German   economic  influence- would,  bepredominant in the country for  man)&apos; years.]     Sir H. Rumbold on September 13th (received  21st) forwarded information derivedfrom a source generally reliable, to the effect that the apparent &quot; democratisation &quot;of  Germany, combined  with the  grant of autonomy  to  Alsacfe-Lorraine, within thelimits of the German Empire, will form the basis for a new peace offensive.     On September 19th Sir Id.-Rumbold forwarded a Stock Exchange rumour from Stockholm  and Amsterdam to  the effect  that the Chancellor had said that he was ready  to discuss the question of the East, and that he thought there would soon bean  armistice.     Admiralty Report No. 332 attributes the attitude  of the German  Press (reported last week) on. the Vienna Note to Foreign Office instructions.   The deduction is drawnJfrom the unanimity displayed in comments.  Report No.  333 gives the substance  ofthe German official reply to the Note.     German Wireless  comment  on the Vienna Note and  on League  of Nationsproposals  is very voluminous  (September  19th, 20th, 2lst, 22nd,  and 25th).  much attention is paid to the reception, of  the  Vienna Note in  America  and France,  toM.
