SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT  No. 90.PART II. FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.                          PEACE DISCUSSIONS (page 1.8).    Interest centres in the German reply  to President Wilson&apos;s last Note, which isgiven on page 19.  Pending the publication of the reply, it is not possible to form anestimate of  the change said to have  taken  place in  the control  by  the  militaryauthorities over German policy.  President Wilson&apos;s determination to deal separatelywith Austria-Hungary is significant.  Turkey, so far, has  only appealed  to PresidentWilson in somewhat similar terms  to the appeal by  Prince Max of  October  6th onthe part of Germany.   The Turkish Note did not reach the President until the  Mth.Germany still seems to be in a position to dominate  the  situation in  Constantinopleby force.                               GENERAL (page  2).     Further information is  given about the  ill-treatment by Germany of british prisoners, and details of the  demands made by His Majesty&apos;s Government for redress.Also  about   the  anxiety  of the  Belgian Government concerning the prospects  ofGerman brutality.

GENERAL.    Sinkings. According  to tlie War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total  tonnageof 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross  in the case  of sailing-ships, reported lost owing to  the malice of the King&apos;s enemies  during the periodOctober 4th-10th inclusive, was 47,886 tons gross, of which 16,244 were British, ascompared  wdth 31,524 tons gross, of which 28,869 were British, reported last week.    The  Admiralty  reports   (October  5th) : &quot; The&apos; losses   of  world tonnage inSeptember due to enemy action are very much lower than in any  month since tilecommencement of unrestricted submarine warfare..   The reduction on the Augustfigure  is almost entirely accounted for by  the reduced losses sustained by &apos; other allies &apos; and &apos; Neutrals.&apos; &quot;    The Daily Review of October 15th quotes a long article from the Kreuz-zeitungon the results of U-boat warfare.    British Merchant Vessel Construction. &quot; The total number of  merchant steam-ships of 100 tons and upwards completed during the first nine months of 1918 amountsto 329, with a  gross tonnage of 1,174,641.&quot;    British Tonnage Gains and Losses for September. &quot; In the month of september the new British-built tonnage entered for service exceeded the British tonnage  sunk by  enemy  action,  but the total British tonnage lost by enemy- action  and  marinerisk slightly  exceeds the new British construction.   Owing,   however,  to increasedtonnage purchased overseas and transferred from foreign flags there is a net gain toBritish shipping during the month of September of over 20,000 tons, while the tonnage available  for service  has increased during-  the  month by over 70,000 tons in conse-queuce of a further large reduction in the British tonnage under and awaiting heavy .repairs.&quot;    Neutral Conference regarding Decisions of Belligerent Prize Courts. The ForeignOffice learns that the Copenhagen Conference (see Report No. 88) will not make any official statement of its proceedings until  these  have been,  approved by the Dutchdelegates, wdio appear to  have been stopped somewhere  in Germany on their way tothe Conference.  It is reported that resolutions were adopted  advocating a SupremeInternational  Court of Appeal, and recommending that the belligerent  countries should  be requested  to  revise certain  decisions regarded as unjust,  and to  givecompensation  in cases of alleged hardship, whether  Prize. Court proceedings  havebeen taken or not.   The Swedish delegates were somewhat -Outspoken about german submarine outrages ;  the  Danes, however, while  condemning them  individually,appeared  afraid openly to express  or endorse any strictures on  the subject.     Anglo-German Prisoners Agreement. The German Government has communicatedthrough the Netherlands  Government its decision  not  to ratify  the new german agreement for the exchange  of prisoners  unless guarantees  are given against the deportation or internment of Germans in China.  Bis Majesty&apos;s Government maintainsits refusal to discuss this matter in connection with the agreement, but has expressedits willingness to ratify the agreement (subject to alterations already accepted) if this condition is withdrawn.  This would allow of  the repatriation of submarine, officersin Holland and  Switzerland, and of the reciprocal, repatriation from Germany andGreat Britain of merchant officers and seamen and fishermen over 4-5 years of age.     Ill-treatment  of  British,  Prisoners.- In  view  of recent information as to thecontinued maltreatment by Germany of British prisoners of war behind the lines, andin the salt mines and  elsewhere, His Majesty&apos;s Government has  determined to takedrastic steps with a view to bringing these proceedings to an end.  It has accordinglycalled upon the German Government forthwith to redress the  grievances complainedPART  II.-FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.
of and, in particular (lj immediately to remove  all British  prisoners to a distance of not less  than 30  kilometres behind the tiring lines ;  (2)  to afford  proper- andhumane  treatment  to  the prisoners in  occupied  territories and elsewhere ;  (3)  topermit representatives of  the Netherlands Government forthwith to visit and inspectthe occupied territory behind the German  lines with a view to ascertaining whetherthe grievances complained of have been  redressed ;  (4)  to undertake  that  no Britishprisoner  shall henceforth be employed underground in a  salt mine;  and (5)  to adoptand undertake to carry  out Articles 28 to 59 of  the  recent  Hague Agreement, which.contain a humane code for the treatment of  prisoners of war.   ddie German govern-ment has been notified  that, unless within  four  weeks (being the  period of noticestipulated  by the Hague Agreement  of 1917)  these requirements  are accepted  andthe British Government is satisfied by the reports of the neutral representatives that thenecessary action has been taken, the British Government will take, in concert with itsAllies, such measures of reprisal as it may deem necessary for compelling the GermanGovernment to treat the prisoners of war in its hands in accordance with the rules  ofinternational law and with the practice of civilised nations,  and that  in any case theBritish Government will hold  Germany responsible for the  unlawful and  inhumantreatment of the British prisoners in German hands, and will take all steps in its powerto ensure that the  persons responsible for  these outrages shall be punished for theirmisdeeds,   ddie nature of the  further reprisals which  may have to he taken will  beconsidered in consultation with  the Allies.   Steps are also  being taken for securingthe better treatment of our prisouers  in Turkish hands ; and instructions have beengiven to G-enerat A 1.1 en by that, in the event of an  armistice being concluded with turkey,  the immediate and unconditional return of the British prisoners should  berequired.     ddie Hague Agreement is being published  at once, together with further reports by Air. Justice YoungeFs Committee on the Treatment of Prisoners of War by theEnemy, containing evidence of the maltreatment of British prisoners both by Germanyand by Turkey.     German Rates for British Prisoners&apos; Cheques. The Foreign Office, learning thatthe  cheques of British officer prisoners in Germany are  being cashed  at  a loss offrom 15  to 20 per  cent., has given  the  German Government, one months notice that, failing a satisfactory arrangement, the cheques of German officer prisoners  inGreat Britain will  be cashed at a loss of 20 per  cent, of their  value.  It is pointedout that the German Government has  never yet dealt with  the proposal made hy HisMajesty&apos;s Government for the cashing of British cheques by the Banish Red Cross.   &apos;  Prisoners of  War  in Austria. ddre  Foreign Office has received  informationindicating that food in Austria is so short, and parcels  so  robbed, that the health ofBritish prisoners of war in that country is likely to  suffer.   If reprisals or exchangesare impracticable, it  is  suggested that  the  food  should be  transmitted throughneutrals person ally.      Franco-German   Prisoners  Agreement. Lord  Derby   reports  that  up  to October 11th, 2,205 French and 2,050 German non-commissioned officers  and men have  been  repatriated under  the Franco-German  agreement.  The agreement  was suspended  at  the  end of July on account of  irregularities  by the German Govern- nrent, but is to be resumed on October 15th, the French Government  having obtained reparation and guarantees.      Refugees  and the Dutch  Frontier. On October  Sth  the  Netherlands Premier stated in the Second Chamber  that the Government must be prepared for the crossing of the Dutch frontier by foreign troops  and possibly by many refugees.   The former. would have to be interned, and steps were being taken to provide sufficient military forces for this purpose.  Mr.  Robertson reports that the Netherlands Government  has pointed out to the German Government  that  whereas voluntary refugees  would lie received (subject to provision being made for their nourishment), admission would probably be refused if any attempt were  made to drive  refugees  forcibly over  the frontier.      German Devastation of  Occupied,  Territory. On  October  Sth  the Belgian Minister expressed to Air. Balfour, on  behalf  of his Government, the earnest desire that there should be an international protest against the further destruction of Belgian.
towns.  The Belgian Government had reason to fear that, if the Germans were forced.to retreat in Belgium, they would leave behind  them the same melancholy desert thattheir retreating armies had left in France.  A protest in general terms, on the linesof the recent French declaration, would seem best suited to the case.   The Ministeralso communicated  a memorandum, from which it appears  that so late as September27th the United States Government had expressed the view that  such a protest mightonly provoke further outrages, but that the French  Government on September 13thhad indicated  its approval,  in principle,  of a joint Allied declaration.  (See  alsoReport No. 89.)     German Wireless of October 11th emotes the military correspondent of the NieuiceGourant as stating that  &quot;the  rejection of the German offer means a  fight for life anddeath for Belgium,  devastation  such as that of northern  France ;  as Germany, by suchrejection, will be compelled to extreme measures.&quot;  German Wireless of October 13themotes a long apologia by Dr. Solf in  this connection.  He shifts the blame on to theAllies, &apos;,&apos; wdio indeed are the attackers  and  not  the defenders.&quot;  &quot;So  long as  the lighting continues, just  to such an extent we shall have to regret the  loss of irreplace-able works of art;  consideration  even for  the  most, venerable  seats of culture mustyield to consideration for the  lives of the  defenders of our country.&quot;     Mr. Robertson  is reliably informed that the  Germans are preparing to destroyAntwerp docks.     Torpedoing of &quot; Leinster &quot;  and, &quot; Ilirano Maru.&quot; On October 10th the Irish MailSteamer Leinster was torpedoed and sunk with  the loss of  some 450 out of 700 lives.On the same day  the Japanese passenger vessel ilirano  Maru was torpedoed  in Irishwaters with the loss of over 200 lives.   The Swedish papers  Social Democralenand Stockholms Tidningen of October 12th. describe these as &quot; Lusitania deeds.&quot;  TheForeign Office learnt on October I2th that  the  German Legation at The Hague had urged the German Government to express  its  regret and  attribute these acts to theold regime.   On October 13th a statement in this  sense  was made by Herr Erzberger,who took the opportunity to add (1) that it was the  &quot; task of all the Governmentsconcerned not to allowr this disastrous occurrence to become an obstacle to the successof  the peace move,&quot; and (2) &quot;I think  anxiously of Lille, from which at this hourthousands of shelterless persons are  flying, upon  whom at  the last hour unnecessarysuffering may come.  It is to us unthinkable  that  now, when the door of peace beginsslowly to open, unfortunate women and children should still have to suffer on accountof a war  whose cessation ought now to be a question  only of clays.&quot;ALLIED  GROUP.                                    BRAZIL.    Spanish [Influenza. Mr.  Dickie  reports an  epidemic of Spanish  influenza atFernambuco.                                    CHINA.    Inauguration  of  President Hsu Sliih-Chang :  North  and South.-^Siiv J. Jordanreports the inauguration on October 10th of president Hsu  Shih-Chang.  The speech of congratulation offered by Sir J. Jordan as  doyen of the foreign  representativesconcluded  with an expression  of  the hope  that  the President would  succeed inreuniting the North and South (see Reports Nos. 85-88).   The President^ reply wrasexclusively addressed to the Allied representatives.    Sir C. Greene, reports the view of Viscount Uchida that North and South should themselves, if possible, find the means of reconciliation, failing which  Japan would beglad to discuss wdth His Majesty&apos;s Government  the question of intermediation.  Mean-wdaile, Viscount Uchida  was  impressing on the responsible element in  China thedesirability - of being  able  to send to the Peace Conference (which seemed  to be
5j-approacking) a representative of a united China.  Sir J. Jordan reports the publication in the Peking  newspapers  of  a  telegram from Mr. Wilson congratulating  the  newPresident and pointing out that China must  compose  her internal dissensions beforeshe can co-operate with her sister nations towards the  attainment of  their ideals;  itwas  an auspicious moment  for  leaders in China  to  concert  in the restoration  ofnational unity.     Resignation  of  Tuan Chi Jui. Sir  J.  Jordan reports that Tuan  Chi Jui hasresigned  the Premiership.   He  still,  however, retains an important administrativeposition, and his presence  in  the Government is  an  impediment to any  settlement between North and South.  Sir C. Greene reports that  the Japanese Foreign Minister-anticipated that this resignation would synchronise with the inauguration of the  newPresident, and considered it desirable that Tuan Chi Jui should seek another post.     Tibet. -Sir J. Jordan learns that on or about September 20th a draft  agreementbetween the Tibetan General and the Chinese representatives at Tachienlu, providingfor mutual withdrawal of troops and  cessation of hostilities for  one year  pendingdecision of the  Chinese Government  regarding the Ghiamdo agreement,  was referredto the Kalon Lhama and the Commissioners for approval.    Sir J. Jordan  points outthat  he has  since  that date  informed the local British representative,  who assistedtowards this arrangement, that the Chinese Government is most unlikely to ratify theChiamdo  agreement.   (And see Reports Nos. 65, 76, 82, 83, 86 and 88.)                          CZECHO-SLOVAK NATION.     Diplomatic Representation. Lord Derby reports  that Dr. Benes has signified theconstitution of the Czecho-Slovak Provisional  Government in Paris and now asks theacceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of Dr. Osusky as its diplomatic representative in London.                                    FRANCE.    The Socialists. The Socialist Congress has come to an end and  the  Party, by1,528 votes to 1,212 votes, gave its support to M. Longuebs Internationalist resolution and rejected  M. Renaudebs  motion,   ddre  resolution says that the Socialist  Party,while supporting national defence, reneAvs its adherence to the International, rejectsall collaboration with the  bourgeois class, and  demands the convening of  an Inter-national Socialist Conference.   The Party should set itself against any Governmentwhich continues to oppose the meeting of the International and against any Govern-ment  entering into negotiations with the  Conservatives or welcoming air Imperialisticprogramme, setting aside acceptable peace proposals, or attacking the working class and its organisations.  The Party confers a mandate upon  its  elected representatives to act  by employing, according to  circumstances, all the means in  their power,including the  refusal to  vote credits.   The Party condemns  the  operations  begun in Russia  and  Siberia and demands  for all  the peoples  the  right  to governthemselves.                                   ITALY.    Baron Sonnino&apos; and the Jugo-Slav Question.-In  the  course of a despatch dated september 20th Sir R. Rodd reports :-&quot;Tire articles in the Press for the most partrecord with greater or less explicitness a satisfaction  that the encouragement accorded to the liberation movement  in  favour of  Jugo-Slavia is  not inconsistent with themaintenance of the diplomatic situation which safeguards  Italian aspirations.....The inopportune philippics of the Corriere only defeated their  own object and led to aconsiderable reaction of public  opinion in favour of  BarOn Sonnino,&apos; who,  in  spite ofthe constant fire of  criticism  to.which he is subjected, is nevertheless regarded as thebackbone of Italian resistance, and is well-known to be incapable of acting from any    66:53-2b                               B
motives but those of the purest patriotism.   There was  also a suspicion of foreign,and especially of French, influence having been exercised  to promote the newspapercampaign. .. . .  The  view sustained by Baron Sonnino  was practically that, once it&apos; could be  assured that  a new Jugo-Slav State  would  be definitely and finallyseparated  from the Austrian  Empire,  Italy  would  no  doubt have  to.  renouncecertain advantages secured to  her by the Treaty of  London, but that until it becameclearly established  that Jugo-Slavia would not  be merely an autonomous  State,.forming a  part of  that  Empire, it would be  unsafe  for Italy to renounce any of the guarantees she  had obtained against the secular menace to her shores  and frontiers,which geographical and territorial conditions  had enabled Austria to exercise  andwhich would only become more and more formidable as Austria fell more and moreunder the influence of Germany.   Bissolati,  on  the  other hand,  seems  to  have sustained  that some categorical assurances  to  that effect  must be given, in order toensure the whole-hearted efforts of the Jugo-Slav peoples to continue the struggle fortheir absolute  and complete severance from the Austrian Empire, which would thenpractically cease to exist.....It was largely through  Signor Nitths influence  thata formula was found which proclaimed the independence of the Jugo-Slav State asbeing, in the opinion of the Italian Government, in  conformity with the principles forwhich the  Allies are lighting, and as constituting one of the bases of an  equitable and lasting peace.   This formula  both  the antagonists found  themselves able  to acceptwhile maintaining their own  individual points of  view.....That Baron Sonninoshould have remained in office and  have  accepted  the declaration to which publicityhas now been given is, I think, to the advantage of  the Allies.   While I have nomisgivings now  as  to  the steadfastness of  this country, as  a whole, in the cause inwdiich they are  now involved,  there must always inevitably remain here numerouselements whose attitude is contributory to weakness and depression, whereas Sonnino isidentified by the country wdth  an uncompromising spirit in sustaining to the end thewar policy for which he is primarily responsible.&quot;     The  Foreign Office learns that Jugo-Slavs volunteering  for  service with theAllied armies show a   general desire for incorporation in the Serbian army under an oath of allegiance to King Peter  as Ruler of Jugo-Slavia.    Sir R.  Rodd reports,however, that Baron Sonnino holds strong views on  this matter as tending to prejudge the self-determination of the various races.  In  particular  he opposed  the  taking of-such an oath by Slovenes from the Trieste district  who  might eventually becomeItalians.  A new campaign against Baron  Sonnino  is imminent, and it will become necessary  to balance  the accession of recruits to the  Serbian  Army against hisretention in the Italian  Government.   The French Ambassador at Rome is convincedthat the latter is of more importance to the Allied cause.     Allied Economic  Missions. Sir  R. Rodd  reports that the Italian   Government,acting upon representations by the Italian Committee of Supplies, has  requested theAllied Governments to  instruct their respective Economic Missions in Italy  to consultin  future  the competent Ministers regarding proposed  purchases, wdth a view to the keeping down of prices,  the  prevention  of  unnecessary competition, the control of markets, the accordance of export facilities, and the maintenance of Italian assistanceto the Allies  within  the limits prescribed by  the internal needs of the country.                                     JAPAN.    Siberian Policy. The  Japanese  Foreign  Minister  has issued to the Press an exhaustive general statement comprising friendly references to the United  States,Russia, France, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.  With regard  to  Siberian  policy,however, Sir C. Greene reports  that Mr. Hara  has so  far given no assurance  beyondan expression of a desire to  act in harmony wdth the Allies  and especially wdth theUnited States.   Meanwhile,  Count Terauchi and Baron Goto  are  being invited to resume their seats in  the. diplomatic  Advisory Council  wdiich they inaugurated andwhich the new Government has decided to perpetuate.  The Foreign Office instructsSir C. Greene, in view of the urgent necessity  for assisting the Czecho-Slovak forces and other friendly; elements,  to press the importance  of  hearty co-operation, to wdiichthe Enitecl States Government would oppose no difficulties.
                                  PORTUGAL.    Ministerial Changes.--Sir L.  Carnegie reports that the  Portuguese Ministry-resigned on October 7th and has since been reconstructed.  Dr. Eso Moniz, Ministerat Madrid, has been appointed Foreign Secretary.    Influenza. Sir L. Carnegie reports the prevalence of influenza in various formsthroughout  Portugal.   There  have  been  many  deaths amongst the. half-starvedpopulation in the north.  In Lisbon the disease has on the whole  assumed a milderform.          .                      UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.    Sir Erie geddes&apos; Mission.- Sir W. Wiseman transmits  a message from  colonel house expressing  great appreciation of  the Admiralty Mission headed  by Sir EricOeddes.    -    Recruiting Conventions. Mr. Barclay reports that the United States Governmentis  anxious that His Majesty&apos;s  Government should assent to the  application of  the recruiting Conventions (see  Reports Nos. 53 and  56)  outside the continent of  theUnited States, namely, to Hawaii and Porto  Rico.   Apart from the tin desirability ofa misunderstanding between  the State  Department  and  the Senate and MilitaryAuthorities on the  general question, it is suggested that  the application of the Frenchand  Portuguese Conventions in Porto  Rico might be  affected  by an apparentdiscrimination in favour of Great Britain.ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    The Emperor Karl and the Federal Idea. The Foreign Office is informed  that,since the Emperor Karfs decision to anticipate the Peace Conference by a federationscheme (see  Report No.  89) became  known,  the  Austro-German  parties  in theReichsrath have been in continuous communication with the Berlin Government.  Itis realised in Habsburg  circles that the Austfo-.Germ.ans  are  determined to join theGerman  Empire as a federal State, with the  Emperor Karl as Bunclesffirst.   some difficulty is expected in this connection as to (1) his future title, and (2) his  consti-tur.tonal  relations with  the  Slav States, which will  be created, and with Hungary.For his part, there are indications  that the Emperor  perhaps contemplates regainingfor his House, with the assistance of the South German States, the dignity of GermanEmperor.  It is significant  that the Korrespondenz  Bureau,  while  propagating theidea of an Austro-German Federal State, is simultaneously  spreading rumours of the intended abdication of the Kaiser.   (See under &quot; Germany.&quot;)    Meanwhile the following alternative schemes are reported to have been proposedby the Emperor to the  Reichsrath  party leaders : (1) That the different  nationalitiesshould elect  a National Council to prepare  a scheme of federation based on  self-determination ; (2)  that  a Parliamentary Government should be designated  by theReichsrath to establish a federal constitution. -  Both these proposals were unanimouslyrejected  by the Slavs ; the Poles insisting upon the unification  of all Polish territories,the Czechs and Southern Slavs maintaining that the reconstruction of the AustrianEmpire should be dealt with by the Peace Conference.  The Hungarian leaders statedthat, since the Monarchy was constitutionally based upon duality,  Hungary woulddeclare her independence of the federalisation  of Austria.    Hungary -&apos; Ministerial Crisis.-Sir H.  Rumbold reported on October  11th theopinion of ,a prominent  Hungarian that the  Wekerle Cabinet was  expected  to fallalmost immediately  and  to be  succeeded by a  Liberal  Ministry.   (And see  Report
Ho. 89.)  The same  informant  stated  that  Count Tisza was trying  to get back into, power, from which it would probably be very difficult to dislodge him.    Poland. See- under &quot; Germany.&quot;                                   GERMANY.    General  Situation. An  official telegram received at The  Hague from Berlin onOctober 15th announces that the Reichstag will assemble on October 18th.    German  Wireless  of October 12th states :  &quot; ddie completion of ParliamentarianGovernment in Germany by  means of the appointment of further members of Parlia-ment  is imminent.  The Centre representative Giesberts, a Director of the GeneralUnion of  Christian Societies, will, according to the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,become Under State Secretary of the Imperial Eswuviuj Department.  The well-knownProgressive representative, Konrad  Haussmann, presumably will enter the inner WarCabinet as Fourth State Secretary without portfolio.  Moreover, the former Under StateSecretary of the War Food Department, the Social Democratic  representative, AugustMueller, will  be transferred as Under State Secretary in the Imperial Economy Depart-in en t.   He will be succeeded in the War Food Department  by the Social Democraticrepresentative, Robert Schmidt.&quot;   German Wireless (Gctober 9th) sends out  thefollowing  two  messages: &quot;ddie  Federal Council  yesterday approved  the Billregarding the alteration of the Imperial system of Government,  and the Bill regardingdeputiscition   for  the  Imperial  Chancellor.    The  official announcement  of  theappointment   of the members  of  the  new German Imperial Government  already mentioned takes place simultaneously with the declaration that the Federal  council has approved  a  Bill  as  an  appendix to the  Constitutional Daws, whereby membersof the Imperial Government will not need to lay down their  Reichstag mandates.&quot;A  Berlin  telegram  (via Amsterdam,  October 13th)  says that,  according  to  the newspapers, two new Bills will be introduced in the Reichstag very soon  which aim at the further extension of the Imperial Constitution in the  sense of parliamentarism.One Bill  relates to Article 11  of  the Imperial  Constitution, according to which  the kaiser  is  the  only one who has authority in  the name of the  Empire to declare war or conclude  peace.  Hitherto the Kaiser has only required the consent of  theFederal Council  for  the declaration  of  an  offensive  war.  By  the  new Bill  theco-operation  of the Reichstag in  deciding rear or  peace is  to be  laid  down in  theConstitution.   (German Wireless of October Kith reports that this Bill was passed onOctober 15th by the Federal Council.)  By the second Bill, which concerns Article 17of the Imperial Constitution, legal responsibility is  to be created for the  Chancellor.Idre responsibility of the Chancellor for regulations  and decrees in the name of theEmpire is  already laid down in the above-mentioned article, but up to the present  ithas not been determined what legal effects this responsibility has for the Chancellorhimself. German Wireless of October 14th reports : &quot; The Government has publishedan amnesty  decree,  according to wdiich the  Imperial Chancellor and  the PrussianMinister for  Justice are instructed that people, who  have been  sentenced&apos; by ImperialLaw Courts or by Prussian Civil Law Courts (including  extraordinary Courts-Martial)for political crimes, are to be  mentioned for  an amnesty.   Sentences for punishableacts in- connection with strikes,  street  demonstrations, food riots,  and similar  trans-gressions,  fall especially within,  the  scope  of the  decree.&quot;  German Wireless ofOctober 11th reports a long  statement by Herr Erzberger of the steps  already takenby the  new  Government &quot; to place the  military power   under  the control  of  the civil authorities in  a  complete and  permanent  fashion, as far as polities are concerned,&quot;e.g., the substitution  of  General Scheuch for  von  Stein  as  Minister for War,  theremoval of Generals Vietinghoff  and Haehnisch (two apostles  of militarism), and thesubordination of local military  administrative decisions  to  the approval of provincial Presidents or the Minister for War himself.     The views of Professor Nicolai  on the  present German Government are coin-municatecl to  the Foreign  Office as follows :--Prince Max  is- a man of  honest- and liberal ideals, but  it  is impossible that a  man who may at any time- become  anautocrat should be essentially democratic.   The principles now expressed  by the new administration under  force  of circumstances are  really &quot;  stolen thunder &quot; from theIndependent Socialists.  The few internal reforms which it wdll be able to effect will. not change  the  fundamental  system.   This  remains in the  hands of  bureaucrats.However well-intentioned the leaders of the  Government are,  the Geheimrats,- Chiefs-of Departments, &amp;c, wdll continue to  carry on  administrative  work in the old  spirits
Reform can only come slowly ; the present Government will  allow greater liberty of speech and of the Press, and thereby  the people will gradually learn and will demandmore and more far-reaching concessions.     German Wireless of October  9th, referring to an article by Professor Delbruckin the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung  on &quot; Prince  Max  as Imperial Chancellor,&quot;states :  &quot; With regard to  the question whether a Coalition  Ministry was intended  bythe  new  Chancellor, Professor  Delbruck writes: &apos; Nothing was  further from  his mind.  From the very beginning he has  been firmly decided to form nothing but amajority Ministry.&apos;  &quot;  On the same date Sir II. Rumbold transmitted information to thefollowing effect : Up till the night of October 3rd it was the intention of Prince Maxto form  a Ministry of National Defence,  including Streseinan, one  member  of theCentre and one Labour representative.  Early on October   1th, Hindenburg,  in thename of the General Staff, insisted on his acceptance of the full Socialist programme,including the  immediate  evacuation of Northern France and Belgium.  The Miln-cliener  Post  says:   &quot;To make heroic  gestures at this moment is very   cheap, butit can  greatly injure Germany&apos;s  future.   That the  German  Headquarters  are  nolonger  under the  illusions  to  which the Pan-German shriekers  cling  is  evidentfrom the fact that the German peace offer was approved of if not actually instigatedby Headquarters.    The idea of a victorious peace is no longer entertained, even  bythe  extremist Pan-Germans.  Our military measures wdll  become  solely defensiveactions,  but they  will still  cost  us  immense sacrifices.&quot;  A report received  by theForeign Office  shows that  on October 6th the German Government wras advisingits   representatives in  neutral  countries  that military  and  internal  political considerations made  it necessary to  contemplate the  conclusion  of peace.    OnOctober 11th Sir  M. Findlay transmitted a report that leading  bankers in  Berlinwere ready  to  accept  any conditions,  and  regarded  revolution as  inevitable  ifpeace were unobtainable.  All classes openly declared that Germany was  beaten andat the end of her resources,  cursing  the Kaiser and the military leaders.  There was further  said  to be great friction between the  Prussians and the  South Germans,particularly the Bavarians.   Mr. Robertson reported that there was great disorganisation-tion amongst the Germans in Belgium.  The German  civil authorities were preparing to leave, and to  hand over to Belgian officials.   Germans  in Belgium were said  to regard  their cause as completely finished, and  to be  ready to accept  any  terms,including the surrender of Alsace-Lorraine.   Lord  kilmarnock  reported  that theGerman Minister in Copenhagen was said to have described the situation as desperate,and that the Allies&apos;  terms must be accepted ;  also (from another source) that lack  ofmaterial in  Germany made  the  acceptance  of  such terms within  the next threemonths  essential.    On October 12th Mr. Robertson  reported that a general  strike at Krupps&apos;  factories  was  imminent, and  that the workers  of one department were already out, parading the  streets,  singing  revolutionary  songs,  and  cursing  the kaiser.   Sir  IT. Rumbold  reported  on October 4th  that (according to the statementof a German pacifist) the revolutionary current in the German  army was  now  so. strong,  that special companies, and  even entire regiments, were being formed  of trustworthy old soldiers,  with a view to the  repression.of outbreaks. &apos; It was statedthat the Kaiser had a special bodyguard of 3,000 such men.   Lord kilmarnock andMr. Lindley mention  a  report, not improbable, except for exaggeration, that 40,000German soldiers recently ordered to  the Bulgarian front, had thrown down their armsand cheered for revolution.      On October 11th. Sir 11. Rumbold reported  a  statement by a person in close touchwith Prince Max, that the latter realised his task was hopeless, and had only accepted it as a patriotic duty.   On October 13th Mr/Robertson reported that  the  publication of extracts from Prince Maxs letter  to Prince Hehenlohe  (see Report No.  89) were causing  a  certain agitation. In any case,  both the ultra-Conservatives and  the Socialists were very  angry wdth him,  aud might unite  to  bring  about his  fall. Dr.  Solf, von  Kuhlmann  or  Soheiclemaim  were possible  successors.   A  Berlin telegram of the same date to the  Frankfurter Zeitung  expressed  the view  that Prince  Max&apos;s  resignation  would  be  recommended  as in the best interests of  the peace move.   In  the event of his retirement Auee-Ohaneellor von Payer or Dr. Solfwould probably succeed him.  German Wireless of October 15th quotes  the Berliner Tageblatt as observing: &quot;If the writing  of the letter constitutes  a hindrance  in the way of the  peace negotiations which are full of prospects, then the letter-writerwdll go.  If it be shown that he is not ready to act decisively, so as  to  blot out  the      6033- 81/                            C
error of. toe past by speed and  his  whole, action, then another must be put in hi splace.&quot;   According to au  official telegram  received at ddre  Hague from Berlin onOctober loth the Social  Democratic Party has resolved that there is no obstacle toPrince Max remaining Chancellor.     The Independent Socialists  have, however, maintained a consistent opposition tothe  new  Government,  According  to  the  Norddeutsehe (October  6th), Haase, in opposing Fehrenbaclbs motion for the adjournment after Prince Max&apos;s speech,  said :&quot; It  is the duty of the people&apos;s representatives in this historic moment, when the old system  must abdicate and the sovereignty of the people take its  place, to remain in session.  (Haase was called to order.)  ddie momentous decisions  now imminent are discussed  in  every home,  in  every  hut, but the Reichstag has not  the same right.This is  not in accordance with the interests of the people and of freedom.   confidence in peace  can only be vested in the freedom of the masses of  the  people.&quot;   TheLeipziger V olkszeitung, which is quoted -by the  Kreuz-Zeitung, writes: &quot;IndependentSocial Democracy has from the  outset adopted a sceptical and antagonistic attitudetowards the new Government,   It  is to be anticipated  that the new Government^foreign policy will not  fully correspond  with our  principles.  Opposition to this government is necessary because it does not signify  the complete political liberation of the German  people from the system of semi-Constitutionalism ;  because it leavesuntouched  those privileges that, with the complete dawn  of democracy,  must beremoved;   because it adopts as its own  that suspicious appeal for &quot;order&apos; whichreactionary parties in critical situations have always  raised;   and  because it. bindspolitically  the population of the German Empire without having  previously ascertainedthe real wdll of  the people.  This alleged  democratic Government has the fault thatit does not itself stand oil a democratic basis, as the  result of the  Peichstag  elections of 1912 can  assuredly  not  be  represented  to  be an expression  of the  people&apos;swdll in  1918.   ddre Reussischc Tribune (October Sth)  reports  that the IndependentSocialist Party&apos;s Executive Committee and  the  Reichstag Fraktion  have issued thefollowing  manifesto  &quot;To  the German Workers &quot;  &quot;The  militaristic  system  hasreceived a blow from  which no recovery is  possible.   Our Imperialism  has collapsed.ddie democratic and  socialistic idea  is  victoriously  on the  march.  The  Admini-stratiohs peace offer  meets our tireless efforts for peace half-way;   The Independentsfrom the start foresaw the fall of Imperialism, and.remained true to its principles.  Itwas  the only party wdiich.  voted  against the Brest and Bucharest  treaties which theother parties no longer dare defend.   Having  taken our stand against the violation of any nation whatever, it is our  moral right to repel  all attempts  to suppress theGerman nation.  The  Independent Party is the only one which is not compelled to surrender any portion of its peace programme   The Stockholm Memorandum of 1017,suppressed by the Censor and opposed by  the other parties, now comes into  its own.ddie Scheidemann, Ebert, David &amp; Co. programme has  collapsed  as well as that ofthe ruling classes.  The  Social Democratic Party was  impotent  while the  fortunesof war favoured the Imperialists, because they supported the capitalistic Government^war  policies.   They  have  accomplished absolutely nothing for peace, freedom, andthe protection of the workers of  both sexes against exploitation.   Several Social Demo-crats become Ministers at the very time that bourgeois society&apos;s joints are creaking, and thereby they are officially  stamped  as Government Socialists.   Social Democracy has undertaken to  organise- national  defence and  protect the bourgeois  system and abandoned the International Congresses demand that the catastrophe of a world war be utilised for replacing the  capitalistic  by  the  Socialist  system.  Social Democracy&apos;sconditions  of participation in government are so modest that even some bourgeoispapers are dissatisfied.  Neither a political amnesty nor  the removal of  the state ofsiege nor  any other Socialistic  demands are made,  and though  the programme  isdeclared to be.a minimum,  several  concessions have been  made  to  the Governmentand the bourgeois parties,  so weak is  the party revealed on  its entrance  into theGovernment.   Even  the progressive bourgeois  party   should  at  least  execute  thefollowing :  the immediate German  evacuation  of  the  eastern districts.,  includingRumania and Bulgaria; the alteration of the hitherto concluded treaties according todemocratic principles ; a political amnesty, including the discharge of those called upfor service ; the removal of the paragraph  dealing with political offences ;  freedom of speech and of the Press and correspondence; right of assembly ; the proportionalfranchise,  including women;  equal direct  secret franchise by  Imperial law ;  theremoval of the Auxiliary Service Law.;  the restoration and extension of the provisions
for protecting women and  juveniles ;  the eight-hour .day;  the  prevention  of  the-conclusion of  international treaties without the consent;  of  the.popular assembly,  thesame applying to the declaration of war and peace, and the dismissal of Ministers bya Majority vote of the Reichstag.  Our demands are  far more extensive ; our  aim isthe Socialist Republic, which  alone guarantees  the world against the ravages of war.The world is acquiring  a new  aspect,  but not such as Cunow,  Lensch and  Co.prophesied.  It is the international proletarians historic task  to play the leading role in the process of  reorganisation.  Enthusiasm, readiness&apos; for  sacrifice,&apos; and unity areimperative.  The Government Socialists&apos; methods only paralyse the activities of  theworkers  by  strengthening the bourgeois.   &apos; United  under the unsullied  banner of independent  and International Socialism&apos;  must  be  the  war-cry of  the Germanproletariat.  Only thus can j)eace be assured  and the  future of the proletariat  andmankind be guaranteed.   Close the ranks.  It is a question of  achieving the highestaim the  liberation  of  mankind.&quot;   Mr. Clive  reports  that on  October 14th  theSwedish  Social  Democratic  Party  addressed  a  cordial  telegram  to  the GermanMajority Socialist Party.    A second telegram, much warmer in tone, was  addressedto the.  German   Independent  Socialists,  congratulating  them on  their  steadfastadherence to the  true principles of International  Socialism  in  the midst  of  theintoxication of victory and the temptations of Chauvinism.     Protasis  by the reactionaries are  still audible.  In the  Tageszeitung  (October  5th)the Bund der Landwirte  issues a manifesto proclamation stating the Democrats took-advantage  of the  country&apos;s  distress to further  their  selfish ends.   parliamentary government is bound to  injure  Germany.  A strong constitutional Monarchy alone-can  preserve the  Fatherland.   The  foundations   of  Germany&apos;s  power  must  fieperfected, against all inroads.   In the same paper (October 7th) the V alerlandspariel publishes an appeal pointing  out   the  danger of an  armistice  before a  peaceguaranteeing the  honour, territory, and  future  of  the  German  nation  is abso- iutely  assured,  and urging  the  strongest  resistance to the enemy to avoid  a disgraceful peace of subjection.  In. the  Post  (October 7th)  the  Free Conservative Party issues an appeai warning against heeding  the defeatists and urging a  united and iron resistance  to protect the heritage of  the  great elector Frederick the Great, Bismarck, and Moltke.  The  Deutsche Zeitung (October 7th) writes : &quot;The days of reckoning with  the statesmanship which led us into a situation where the opinion of Washington is deemed-valuable in a question vital  for all Teutonism  will not  keep us  waiting  for  ever.   That  reckoning will be  with  that statesmanship and its advocates.&quot;  Walther Rathenau,  in the Vossische Zeitung, observes : &quot; Our demarche was  over hasty.   We have allowed ourselves  to  be carried away  at  an unripe moment into an  unripe decision.   Negotiations  should not begin  when  one  is yielding, but one should  first consolidate the front.   Whoever has  lost his nerve must be superseded.   If an unsatisfactory reply (to the peace proposals) comes we must be prepared.  A Ministry of Defence must be created ;  not a day  should,  be  lost.   The Ministry should  consist of civilians and soldiers, and should have wide powers.&apos;&apos;   The Tageszeitung (October 7th) writes :  &quot; Rathenau  terms the day of the peace offer a black  day for Germany and  predicts a  humiliating reply from Wilson.   He further :says that those who have lost their nerves must be replaced.   This is an annihilating criticism of the new Government.  The vital question  now is  the organisation of national defence.   Our military Command is the natural organ  to perform this duty, but there is no time to be lost.&quot;  Von carls, of October 12th, warned the people that the Junkers were preparing  a coup cTetal.   On October 10th the latter held a  meeting round the Hindenburg statue.                                         . .      But criticism  of the old  regime is now  more open.  The Frankfurter Zeitung -of  October  7th observes,  in connection with  the peace proposals:  &quot; Meanwhile, our  people ought  to  examine the  path  that has led  to this  Note.   The new Chancellor  expressed it  tersely  by  saying that  the peace  step  was the result of the  situation Avhich the new  Government- found on  entering office a  situation -created by its  predecessors and not by it, not by German  democracy,  now repre- -sented for the   first time. They are to blame for  it.  It is  necessary to recognise this guilt and the guilty not that it is now time to mete out punishment there will be time for this after peace is concluded but in  order to  prevent new: and&apos; worse  disorder, because even  now these  guilty ones are  attempting to burden with  their -terrible  guilt  the  new  Democracy which  in truth  docs  but  liquidate the  fatal
             inheritance.   The new Government springs into the breach in order to save Germany.             The Note should  really be signed  by those who have decided Germaiiy&apos;s fate before             and during the war and especially during the last  two years, and who are in truth;             responsible for this situation.   Only a lew days ago  the  pan-German  Government             reactionaries  attempted to make propaganda for  a military dictatorship.  And we             really wish to-day that the secret military dictatorship which has influenced our policy             for the last two years had been visibly established  and had thus been burdened  with             the  responsibility.   Rather we should have wished  it,  if  we  did  hot  know  our             opponents would  have sneeringly refused  any peace to such  a dictatorship, that this             would  have  been  the full ruin of Germany, that then our opponents  would  have-             really dictated  to us the future form of our internal  political life as a  condition of             peace.   Only Democracy could, if at all,  break away  for  peace  by accommodation.             Therefore it was forced at this time to take the leadership  and  responsibility.  Now,.             however, we understand better than  before .IIertling&apos;s  words: &apos;&quot;The&quot;question is the             protection and preservation of the (frown and Dynasty.&apos; &quot;I                 On October 10th Lord Kilmarnock communicated a report that the  Chancellorls             peace  offers had been made contrary to the  expressed wish of the Kaiser, and  that             the  latter would  shortly abdicate.  On October ldth  Lord  Kilmarnock reported A             rumour that it wras intended to make  a  son  of the German Crown Prince  Emperor             under  the Regency of King Henry of  Prussia.  It was also  rumoured  that Prince             Max might become King of Prussia.   On October lith Sir  H. Rumbold reported thatI             it was rumoured throughout Switzerland that the Kaiser had abdicated  in  favour ofSz^z^uty^\  his second son.  The Basiwr Legation declared its inability  to confirm, the event, but             regarded it as -very probable (and see under  &quot;Austria-Hungary&quot;).  On October  12 th             Lord Kilmarnock reported a  statement that the Conservative Party  was in fact the             first to desire  the abdication of. the Kaiser,   ddie Frdnkisehe Tdgespost  (see D.R. of             October 15th) makes an extraordinarily  outspoken  demand for the abdication of the             Kaiser,  stating that the nation is  becoming more and  more  convinced  that  the             responsibility  for the present situation rests upon him.  &quot; In his first Army  Command             he declared :  &apos; I and the Army are born for each  other.  We are indissoluble,&apos; and             now that the Army is coining to an  end, William  cannot do otherwise than terminate             his activities  with it   ...     ddie  Kaiser has  always demanded  the  greatest             patriotic sacrifices from his subjects.   Now when these  subjects are becoming citizens             of the State,  he should show his readiness to sacrifice  himself, should his abdication             thereby make  better peace conditions possibb for the German Empire and the German             people.&quot;                 Prussian  Franchise  Reform. German  Wireless  of  October 12th reports:              &quot; The Suffrage Committee of the Prussian House of Lords accepted on  the last reading              with the rejection of the proposals regarding the granting of a  supplementary vote             for age general, equal, secret, and direct suffrage for the House  of Representatives,.             in  accordance with the  proposal of the Government  Bill.  At  the  same  time  the             period of. residence entitling to the light to vote was reduced from one  year to six             months, and the requirement of three  years of  State citizenship and  compulsory             voting, was  rejected,   ddie  grounds for exclusion from  the right to  vote were             restricted generally, and the number of inhabitants required for the granting of an             additional representative was reduced from 250,000  to 200,000.  Proportional voting-             is to be introduced for certain electoral districts in large towns.  To  the already-             known decisions about the change in the composition of the Prussian House of Lords.             must  be  added   provision  for  16  representatives  of  the  labourers   and eight             representatives  of  other employees.   The   Budget right of  the House  of Lords             towards the House of Representatives is  restricted.   The next  plenary sitting of the-             House of Lords will lake place on October 2-Jth.&apos;:                 Poland, and the Centred Powers. The  Foreign Office is informed that relations-.             between the German Government and Prince Janus Radziwill have become very much             strained  since  the Spa meeting  (see Report  No. 82).  A climax  was  reached when,             immediately before the Bulgarian collapse,&apos;von Hintze informed Radziwill (1) that             the KaiseFs promise to respect the integrity  of the kingdom only applied, to territory             up to the line of the Narew ;  (2) that though the Polish General Staff might nominate-             officers for the Polish  Army, all such appointments would have to  be approved by the             German military  authorities,  that  the military oath would include a clause binding:
the Polish Army to fight on the same side as Germany in all circumstances, and that -in time of war the command thereof should automatically pass into German hands.It is stated that Radziwill handed back the Note  containing these proposals, sayingthat he refused to receive it.  The  present trend of events in Poland shows that theExtreme Left is gaining power rapidly.     The&quot;Frankfurter Zeitung of October (.)th reports the publication  by the PolishRegency Council  of a manifesto to the Polish people (see &quot; Eastern Report &quot;)  callingthem to unity and independence, and proclaiming a democratic basis for the Diet, towhich the Council Avill presently surrender its powers.   This proclamation evokes anangry article in the Eheiniseh-Westfdlisehe Zeitung accusing the Council of hypocrisyand saying :  &quot; They have suddenly cast off all  reserve, and revealed themselves aspowerful political,  antagonists  and anti-Germans of the  purest  water.  The entireproclamation signifies  a break in the policy  of  a friendly  understanding with theCentral Powers, and indicates a new orientation  in the policy of Poland, founded ona  historical  basis.&quot;  German Wireless of October 16th quotes a Vienna report that&quot; at the invitation of the Polish Regency Council the President  of the Polish Club ofthe  Imperial Council,  as well  as the  representatives  of the Club  of  Polish Social-Democrats and  National   Democrats, have  left  for  Warsaw  for  important con-ferences.&quot;     Imports lost to Central  Powers through Bulgarians Defection. The War Office(111. 6 A. 12818,  4th  October  1918)  reports: &quot;.   .    .  Germany is  said to use70,000,000  kilos, of tobacco  a year, of  which  50,000,000  kilos,  are for cigars.Bulgaria could have sent  the other 20,000,000 kilos.,  but Germany had purchasedlarge  stocks in  Turkey,  stocks wdiich  do not appear likely to reach  the  CentralPowers.   In the past  Germany has  been replenishing her stock of cigars throughHolland, but it is  believed that she is no longer receiving supplies from  this source ; infact, a recent report states : &quot; 6,000  cigar factories are closing clown in germany on  account  of  failure  in  supplies of tobacco,  and  it  is said that  by Christmasthere  will  be nothing more to smoke.&apos;   Under these  conditions the  loss of  the bulgarian   tobacco gains  additional  importance,  and  may  probably cause   astill  greater  deterioration  in  the  quality of  the German soldiers&apos; rationWith the closing of the Danube to. their ships, the Central. Bowers lose the prospect ofobtaining cereals, cotton, oil, -manganese or copper in large quantities, and will be obliged to content themselves with whatever they can transport inland through Russia,and  the  railways  leading out of the Ukraine are already taxed  to  their  utmostcapacity .... Of these supplies,  which  the  Central Empires  will lose, the mostimportant is cotton, of which Turkey is-estimated. to have sent 25,000 tons to Germanyand Austria each year.  It is especially important at this  time, as this years  crop  is just ready  for transportation.  It is difficult to give accurate statistics of the otherexports, but it is known that the annual  output of copper is now .1,300 tons, chromeore 1.1,500 tons,  zinc ore 16,800 tons, mercury, 142 tons, antimony 1,500 tons.  Of these the whole of the copper is being sent to Germany, who is also  making use of ferro-chrome as an alternative to tungsten,  of which there is an acute shortage.     German Petrol Requirements after the War. It is reported (M.T. 6  B., No. 737)from a reliable source that Germany contemplates a total  consumption of mineral oil,after the war,  of about five times her pre-war  consumption.  This large . increase  isexpected on account of the great development  of internal  combustion motors and ofthe employment  of a  new  process  for  obtaining alcohol  from  petroleum.  The Germans,  it is  stated,  hope to extract  from the wells  of  Rumania,  of  which they secured the  control  under the treaty of  Bucharest, 55  per  cent,  of  their  total requirements,  which are about 9,000,000 tons per annum, while  the remainder is  to be  brought from Mexico.   It  is  useful  to  note that, according  to  trustworthy statistics, Germany consumed in 1913, 1,300,000 tons of mineral oil (of which 7 per cent,  was  home-produced) while  Rumania has  never  yet  produced  more  than ;i ,900,000 tons in a year.GG33-3bD
JSfEUTRAL GROUP.                                   BOLIVIA.     Agitation  against  the  Black List. Mr.  Haggard reports that, as  a result  ofGerman-inspired agitation, a 13111 has been presented to Congress, according to which persons in  commercial positions are  no longer to be recognised as consular officers  inBolivia,  ddris  Bill is aimed at British  Consuls, and in particular against the  BritishVice-Consul  at Oruro.   If passed it would break up the Avhole  British Black List-organisation.&apos;  Another  Bill, aimed  exclusively at  British  merchants, has  been presented,  under which  foreign merchants are  forbidden,  on  pain  of  line  or imprisonment,  to insert in their  sales contracts a condition that goods are not  to  betransferred to enemies.   V     German  Efforts to secure Bolivian Tin.- A  report received (Aid.  6 B, No. 738)indicatesxthat efforts are being made from Germany to secure, through cloak concerns,the post-bellum output  of the  Statutory-listed Araca  Alining  Company.  (See  alsoReports Nos.  55, 58, and 74.)                                   DENMARK.     Reported German Offer to  Denmark. Wireless Press  of October 12th  reports from Copenhagen : &quot; For the first time for  a long period, the Press is taking  up thequestion of Schleswig.  ddie National  Tiden.de publishes an article in which it setsforth the incontestible right of Denmark to North Schleswig, and expresses the hopethat in the peace settlement this  territory will lie returned  to die mother country.&quot;On the same  date the Foreign Office  received information indicating that the german chancellor had  made  proposals to  cede  to  Denmark  the  Danish-speaking  partof  South  Jutland  in consideration of  economic concessions which  would  permit,the utilisation  of  Denmark as an outlet  for  German  commerce  after the  war.According  to  one  account  this compensation  would-take the  form  of a  fort  inthe Mainland or on an island in the Little Belt.  Lord Kilmarnock and the  UnitedStates  Charge  d&apos;Affaires  have   pointed out  to  the  Danish Government the grave-political and commercial consequences to  Denmark of any exchange  made at thepresent time  and involving such compensation to Germany,  ddie Danish  ForeignMinister has formally and positively  denied  that any  negotiations of this characterhave  taken  place :  he  considers Danish aspirations could  best  lie realised by  an.eventual plebiscite  under Article  5 of the Treaty  of Prague,  but states that theGovernment is  anxious to avoid,  incurring the future enmity  of Germany. It is not improbable that some such bargain is being attempted,  without the knowledge  ofthe Foreign Minister, by zealous  annexationists, very likely  through the medium  of danish Socialist leaders.     Control of German Iron Exports  to  Denmark. A French source states that  allthe iron at present arriving from Germany  in Denmark is  rigorously controlled by a&quot; Central  Iron  Office,&quot;  wdiich  has  been established  at  Copenhagen.  Those whopurchase this iron  can only do   business with  German firms,&apos;and cannot export theiron without  authorisation.  Then- books and stocks are controlled by German agents,and they have  to pay heavy fines in  the case of any infraction of the rules laid  downby the Germans.   The sale price, which  was 84-  marks before the  war,  is now580 marks.   Payments have to  be made in. crowns in  order that the  Germans maybenefit  by the exchange.   Sweden has refused to accept similar conditions. (M.I. 0 *B.,iaSS).  And see Reports Nos. 78 and 88.)                                   FINLAND. s   Allied  Attitude towards  Finland. His  Majesty&apos;s Consul  at Helsingfors  hascommunicated to the  Finnish Government and to the Press, wdiich has  given itfull publicity, the following statement of Allied  policy,  with  special reference to  theapprehension expressed by the White elements regarding alleged British.co-operation
with  the  Reds (see  Report No.  89): &quot; The  Finnish Government  need  have  noanxiety regarding the employment by the Allies in Northern Russia of so-called RedFinns.  The Allied Commander-in-Chief has  enlisted  for service with the Allies anumber of  Finns,  as well as Russians, Serbians,  &amp;c, simply  because  they havevolunteered  to  assist in defending  these  districts against the  Germans and. theirconfederates.   Their political views are a matter of  no importance to the  Allies, whowould not countenance any political, action  on  their part  so long as they are under allied leadership.  So far from desiring to foment revolution in Finland  or  to bringabout  a renewal of civil war, His Majesty&apos;s  Government sincerely  wishes to see a stable and orderly Government in Finland.   As has already been stated on  several occasions, the  forces under Allied  leadership  in  Northern Russia have not crossed,and  wdll not cross, the Finnish  frontier.   The Allies, while Finland  maintains  her neutrality, have no  desire to fight the Finns, and with  a view of  avoiding collisions,which, can  only create  friction between  Finland,  and the Allied  countries, it  is-earnestly to  be hoped that the Finnish Government  will take all. possible steps toprevent Finnish armed troops, whether  alone  or in.  co-operation with German forces,engaging in  operations outside their own. borders.     Election of Prince  Friedrich Karl. On  October  11th  Mr. Olive reported that according to llufvudstadsbladet  the  Finnish Landtdag had  elected Prince FriedrichKarl of Hesse to be King of Finland.  (A  Stockholm Press telegram gives October&apos;9th as the date  of the election.)  The Agrarian Party  strongly protested  on grounds of illegality,  pointing  out  that the Landtdag had  previously  declared Finland are public, and was at present unrepresentative. Mr.  Branting observes in Democraten :-&apos;&quot; The election of the King was carried by  64 votes against  41.  Thus,  of the  200members of  the Finnish Diet less than a third form the foundation, of the new throne.&quot;The  Press  reports  the  following  official French Note (October  13th.) : &quot; Whenthe Government of the Republic recognised the independence  of Finland, it did so in-consequence of  the  vote  carried by the regularly constituted Finnish  Diet.  Thisdecision was inspired, by  the thought  of giving all  possible satisfaction  to  thenational aspirations  of  a people  which  has  preserved within  the  framework  ofthe  Russian  Empire its autonomy  and  its  individuality.   The   Government  ofthe  Republic also reached  an understanding  with the Allied  Powers in  referenceto the establishment of  a diplomatic  representation  in Helsingfors  with a Finnishrepresentation  in France.  Since then  the  Diet, which  proclaimed the independence-of Finland,  has lost its  authority and  power in  consequence of illegal  measureswdiich were  veritable coups d&apos;etat.    It  was  contrary to  the  law that  a Monarchywas   substituted for  a  -Republic.   It was  contrary  to the   law  that a German.Prince was  invited to ascend  the throne  of  a Finnish.  Kingdom which had been-created in contempt of right.  In. no case would France have been,able to countenancesuch acts by the establishment of official  diplomatic  relations  with  the new Govern-ment at Helsingfors.  In no case would it have  been able to consent to  recognise aMonarchy giving itself for a  sovereign a Prince originating from a State  with whichwe are at war.   The election of a Prince of Hesse  would suffice by itself to annul  the recognition granted  to the Provisional Government at the time of the proclamation-of the independence of Finland.  The diplomatic relations which  had  been senii-officially established with the Government  are thus at  an end.   The French Govern-ment  only leaves an agent at Helsingfors, wdiose duties are, and have always been,-of a consular nature,  and wdiose mission  is to assure  the defence of  our interests andthe protection of our  citizens.&quot;     The Withdrawal of German Troops. Mr. Olive   reports  that  all German auto-mobiles have   now  been sent  back  from. Finland  to Germany.   It  is  estimatedthat only about 4,000 Germans remain in the country.   Apart from non-commissioned officers acting as instructors,  only  four German officers are still serving with  theFinnish Army ;  these officers served with the  Finnish  White forces against the Reds.MEXICO.     The Oilfields. Mr. Thurstan reported on  October 1.1th that Government forces were likely to  advance on -Potrero, the Eagle  Company&apos;s well, in  which  case Pelaezwould  retire North and West.
.1.6                               NETHERLANDS.     Commercial Negotiations with Belligerents. Mr. Robertson reported on October 12th that  in view of a  possible invasion by refugees (sec under &quot; General &quot;), and consequent accentuation of  the food  problem,  the  Netherlands  Government was anxious to begin negotiations for an agreement at  the  earliest moment.  The United States Minister has informed the Netherlands Foreign Minister, that his Government has accepted London as the place of negotiation.  The Dutch  delegates, who will have full  powers, wiJl be MM. Colijn, Hendring, Lovink and Snouck.  M. Valstar of the Netherlands Overseas Trust will also be a delegate with full powers.  Mr. Barclay- reported on October 11th that the United States Minister had after all been instructed to  make an  offer of  coal to  be fetched  in  Dutch ships (see Deport No. 89).   The Netherlands  Foreign Minister has informed.  Mr, Robertson  that the German Govern- ment has agreed to  give safe-conducts to about 50,000 tons  of  Dutch, shipping  to fetch outstanding grain from the Argentine.   This offer is stated to be outside the- projected agreement between  Holland arid  Germany,  negotiations for which have- been postponed until the commencement of  the discussions between Holland and the- Allies.  Mr.  Robertson draws  attention to  an announcement  made in the German Press at the  beginning of October that, owing to the food shortage in Holland, German imports of butter under an agreement between the two countries would not for some time be possible; any quantity of butter reaching Germany  from  Holland  might therefore henceforth be imported, free  and no restriction applied to  official imports of. food.  Such  importation  could  be  made over the  frontier, outside  port and railway traffic.                                  NORWAY.     A/. Litvinoff s  Propaganda. Sir  M. Findlay reported  ou  October 10th  that M.  Litvinoff and his party, while awaiting facilities to proceed to Russia (see Eastern Reports Nos. 88  and 89),  employed  themselves  upon  revolutionary propaganda  in Norway.   ddie  Norwegian  and  Swedish Governments  regarded his presence  in Scandinavia  with some concern.     Copper. Sir M. Findlay reports  that the Norwegian Government continues  to- make difficulties regarding its  obligations under the copper agreement, contending&quot; that it has been modified by the  American agreement, and thus apparently claiming- the advantages of both agreements without the disadvantages of either.  It  is reported (M.I. 6 B., No. 739) from  a  sure  source that an  important  copper mine has  been discovered at Kvalevaag, on the island of Karnio, and will shortly  be worked.     Submarine Warfare. ddie Norwegian maritime lawyer, Johan Bredal, recentlydelivered  an address  on the &quot; U-boat War and  the  Neutrals,&quot;  which  appears  inAflenposten (September 22nd) and Morgenbladet (September 24th).   Ilr. Bredal  citedhigh legal authority to show that traffic in contraband was neither illegal nor immoral.Further, that the recognised principles of  all countries demanded that if the sinking-of a ship is unavoidable, the safety of  the crew must be ensured.   But the Germans-pay no regard to this and sink every ship unconditionally which enters the &quot; danger-zone,&quot; whether  laden or in ballast, and whether it has any connection wdth the enemy or not; moreover, ships are sunk even outside the danger zone.  &quot; Not only have the-Germans neglected to put the crew in  safety,  but in individual instances it seems thatthey have  endeavoured to murder them.  It has  happened  that the crew of the-U-boats have called out witticisms  to  the unfortunates,  and these  horrors  have evenbeen taken on the film to be  used, at  home  in Germany.&quot;  The speaker contended that but for the Norwegian sailors  and, last  but  not  least, tin?  aid  of the English.Navy, Norway would  have  been ruined.  The German  argument  of the  freedom  ofthe seas was  a misuse of  words, for  it meant  one  law for the  Germans and anotherfor  all other peoples.                                     SPAIN.     Government Action regarding Enemy Shipping.  On October 9th Sir A. Hardinge-reported that the  National Government,  with the exception  of  Sehor Alba,  would remain in  office.  Count  Rom an ones would appear to have  stipulated  that animmediate decision  shoidd be taken to  seize German  tonnage.   On October lltli.Sir  A. Hardinge reported that the Government had decided to confiscate 15)500  tons-
of  German  shipping,  Germany  being invited  to  designate the vessels  before october 16th, failing which, the Spanish Government would make its own selection.An  official  note  in  the Spanish Press  of  October  15th  announces that  theSpanish Government has. decided, with the acquiescence of the German  Government,to  take  possession  of  seven German  refugee vessels in  order to  replace tonnagedestroyed, by submarines since August 14th last, without prejudice  to the continueddiscussion  of legal questions at issue between the two Governments or claims arisingout of earlier  torpedoings.  This measure  will  be carried out  by the Minister ofSupplies and an official  of the German Embassy.  The  names  of ships  taken  overare Eriphia, Euphemia,  Oldenburg, Trinfiord, Rudolf, Clio,  and  Matilda,&apos; amountingtogether  to 21,000 tons.   The Swiss  Government contemplates chartering 250,000tons of enemy shipping in Spanish ports for  two  years.   The  Foreign Office  has instructed  Sir  PL -Rumbold to  intimate that  in present  circumstances the  AlliedGovernments are unlikely to  approve such charters on  any terms advantageous toGermany.   The  Foreign Office is  informed  that the Spanish.  Government was recently approached by  the Swedish Government with a view to a general agreement for concerted action  in protecting the interests of the neutral countries at the PeaceConference ;  it is believed that this proposal was rejected.     General  Conditions. A Memorandum  (G.T.  5924,  dated  October 9th) by theF.I.D. describes the serious  situation  caused by food shortage  and high prices in spain.  Demands  for higher pay by the Army  and civil  servants, demonstrations,bread riots, and strikes, both local  and general, have resulted.   The majority of the strikes have occurred in mines  and districts producing  material for the Allies, andthe influence of enemy agents  in this  connection is  noticed  by the Spanish Press.Meanwhile, the Republicans make no  secret  of their readiness  to take  advantage ofthe prevailing unrest.     Influenza. Mr. Madden reports an epidemic of &quot;grippe&quot; at Bilbao, . wdiich has caused considerable mortality amongst the poorer classes.                                SWITZERLAND.     Commercial Negotiations. The  W.TT.D.  reports :  &quot; The  Enitecl States  war trade Board desires  that the  negotiations for a  renewal of  the American-SwissAgreement, which expired on  September  30th, should take  place at Washington.This raises a number of difficulties.  The renewal of this agreement gives the AlliedGovernments  an  opportunity  of  obtaining further  important  concessions  from switzerland.  The Swiss  might now be induced  to discontinue the greater proportionof  their exports to the enemy of  manufactured  goods containing Allied  raw materials.This would  involve  abrogating  or  revising Article  10 of the S.S.S.  Regulations :in  either  case questions  of detail will intrude which can  only be   satisfactorilysettled at  Paris or Berne.   A further difficulty arises  regarding  the  Swiss timberand milk  furnished to the Allies under the convention signed  at Berne on May 1stbetween the  Associated  Governments and  Switzerland.  This Convention providesfor a meeting of Allied  delegates at  Berne in November to  consider its renewal.Here  again  technical  details  are  involved wdiich could not very well  be settled  at&quot;Washington.   The United States Government is prepared to share wdth His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the responsibility of  supplying Switzerland with sufficient shipping  tocarry 50,000 tons of imported supplies monthly.   His Majesty&apos;s Government considersthat  in return for this undertaking  the Swiss  should  be asked to   continue their present  monthly advances  to Great Britain (10.000,000 francs  per month).  It would further assist the Allied exchanges in Switzerland if they were required to pay freightfor the ships supplied in Swiss francs deposited at Berne.  (See Report  No. 89.)      German Attack on Swiss Captive Balloon. A Berne Press telegram of October 7thdescribes the recent destruction in broad daylight by a German aeroplane of a Swisscaptive balloon carrying two large  swiss hags  and .painted with two Federal crosses.The German Minister has expressed  his regret.   A further telegram  of October 8threports that the Federal Government  has made  a vigorous protest, demanding fullsatisfaction and punishment of the guilty airman.     Bolshevism. In  a  despatch dated September 28th,  Sir H. Rumbold reports a conversation with the President, M. Calonder, in the course of which the latter spoke     0633-31.                                E
PEACE DISCUSSIONS.        (N.B.  Countries are arranged in cdpha.beti.cal order under this heading.)     General. ddiere are now clear  indications  that the German appeal  to President&quot;Wilson  was a  measure  prompted  by the  internal   situation,  by  the dangerousposition of the German armies on the Western Front, and  by the prospect of Austria-Hungary and Turkey making peace, whether with  or without the concurrence of theGerman Government.                                                     -   ,\.,fg     Owing to  the great bulk of the matter received  during the week  about peacediscussions,  only selections from a few  principal documents,  and from  german wireless, have  been included in the Report.   The Daily Review of the Foreign Press&apos;(and Supplements) from  October 9th to 16th,  contains very valuable summaries of press opinions about the current peace overtures in practically all foreign countries,enemjr. Allied and neutral.  It has been  impossible  to  give detailed references tothese, for want of space, or to the valuable summaries on  political  subjects drawn upby the Admiralty and by the Ministry of Information.    Austria-Hungary. The Foreign Office has received information (dated  October 7th)which  again indicates  the possibility of  the  Emperor  Charles  making an  appealad miserieordiam to King George and to President  Wilson for peace, but  according toone  informant,  quoted  by Sir  H. Rumbold (October 14th), it is  rumoured that theEmperor lias promised,  the Kaiser . personally, not to make peace separately.  Thereare also some indications of possible  separate overtures by Hungary.  Sir H. Rumbold&apos;sreports1 of October Sth,  9th, .10th and 11th confirm these  indications  of a desire for aseparate peace, from the point of  view both, of Austria-Hungary and of Hungary.  Thelimit of endurance is placed at about two months.     Belgium. ddiere are indications (Lord kilmarnock, October  9th)  of  the Germanintention to  devastate  what remains of Belgium  after four years&apos; reigii of terror, if their armies are not  allowed to withdraw unmolested from the-awkwrard position theyoccupy.     ddie Belgian Government is opposed to the  acceptance of proposals  that a PeaceConference should be held in Holland.  (F.O. 170323.)     Esthonia. According to information sent by Mr. Clive (Stockholm, October 11th)and  Lord Kilmamock (Copenhagen,  October 12th) there seems to be a desire amongstEsthonian representatives to throw off German influence in the peace  settlement, andat the  same  time  to   seek the  protection  of   Swedish   troops   against  Bolshevikinfluence.     (See also under  Russia, Sweden, and Ukraine.)     France. On October 11th Lord Derby reported the approval, by the  Commissionof External Affairs, of president WilsoiPs reply to the first appeal by Prince Max.  TheCommission  &quot; counts on the Government not  to accept in the name of  France  anyarmistice which -would  not ensure the  satisfaction  and the guarantees to which the victorious armies of the Entente are  entitled.&quot;     Lord Derby on October 10th, 13th, 14th, and 15th, gave extracts  from the french press,  of which the general tone is one of triumph at the proof of a German defeat, asindicated by appeals for peace,  and  of hope that Germany would  not be able by-discussions to avert the  full consequences.  M. Marcel Sernbat, in Heare, again pressesfor unity in the Allied diplomatic front.1 And Count de Salis (Vatican), October 15th.very strongly about the conduct of the Bolshevist Government, adding emphaticallythat should the Bolshevist leaders be driven out of Russia the Swiss would refuse toreceive them.   Meanwhile he had  been obliged in  the  interests  of Swiss lives and property in Russia to agree, to maintain de facto relations&apos; with the  BolshevistGovernment,   (See Reports Nos. 70, 72, 74, 82, .83, and &apos;87.)
    &apos; Mr. Robertson on October 16th (received 2.15 p.in.) forwarded the report of Germany&apos;s acceptanceof President Wilsoirs terms, which was published in the London evening papers on that day.6633--3o     Germany. On October 9th Sir  II. Rumbold reported,  in  connection with peacediscussions, that Prince Hohenlohe had called the version published in the Swiss press of Prince Max&apos;s letter to him a &quot; garbled version.&quot; On October 10th&quot;Lord kilmarnock-quoted the  opinion of Dr.  Nikolai  that Germany&apos;s position was  desperate, and his suggestions for guarantees to be imposed upon Germany as a  condition of joining a league of Nations.   On the same date Lord  kilmarnock forwarded a report that thepeace offer by Prince Max was made  against the wish expressed by the Kaiser.     On October 10th Mr. Robertson  (The Hague) forwarded a correct forecast of the&quot;German  reply  to. President Wilson.   On the same  date Sir W. Townley  forwardedinformation indicating anxiety of the  military leaders in Germany to save their faceby  getting  the neutral Powers  not  to represent that reply as an indication of thecomplete defeat of Germany.     Prom information forwarded by  Lord kilmarnock on October 11th, it is clear thatthe  German policy of destruction  and devastation during the retirement  of theirarmies has been adopted to force their enemies into  acceptance of the German peaceoffer, in order to prevent such destruction.     Mr.  Robertson on October 12th  forwarded  the  text of the German  answer to president Wilson, which runs as follows :       &quot;In  reply  to  question of  President Wilson, German Government declares asfollows: German Government has  accepted the clauses (Saetze)  which Wilson haslaid down in his message of January 18th, and  later addresses  as  basis of enduring-peace of justice (Rechtsfrieden).  Thus object of discussions to be commenced would only be to reach an understanding over practical details of  the application.   GermanGovernment takes it for granted (nimnit an) that also the Governments of the Powdersin alliance wdth  United States of America take their stand upon the basis of PresidentWilsoids  declarations.  German  Government in agreement with Austro-hungarian government declares itself ready to comply with proposals of President  regardingevacuation with object of bringing about armistice.  German Government  suggeststo President to arrange for meeting of a mixed Commission  whose duties would be tomake  the arrangements  necessary  for evacuation.   Present  German Governmentwhich bears responsibility for conclusion of. peace has been formed  by negotiations and in agreement with great majority of the Reichstag.  In every one of his actionsthe Chancellor supported by this majority speaks in the name of German Empire andof German people.                                                          &quot; (Signed)     SOLF. &quot;     Message was despatched to  President at  1.2 noon.     [N.B. This account differs slightly in detail from the text in German  Wirelessof October 12th.]1     On October 12th Lord kilmarnock reported  on very good  authority that it was at one time proposed to answer President Wilson in the sense that a League of nations should solve the Alsace-Lorraine question.     German Wireless for October lOth-lGth is  full of voluminous references to the communications passing between the German Government and President  Wilson, tothe alterations  made in the German Government, to League of Nations proposals,and to other similar matters affecting the prospect of the  German  armies escapingdisaster on  the Western Front,  by means of peace talk, or by threats to  continuedevastation,  if not allowed to escape.   German  Wireless of October 12th confessesthat evacuation by the German armies would be &quot;technically impossible &quot; (meaningwithout complete defeat of those armies V) excepting &quot; as a part of an  armistice treaty,previously laid down.&quot;  Herr Erzberger (11th) undertakes-to promote the principlesof a League of Nations.&quot;     Great Britain, Reporting for  the week ending on October 9th, the Ministry ofLabour state that Prince Max&apos;s Peace Note was the signal for a chorus of approval inthe  I.L.P.  organs  of the  Labour  Press.  There  was  a  curious  unanimity in thearguments put forward.     On  October  12th Lord  kilmarnock reported  the despatch  to  England viaNorway, of Bolshevist and Jewish literature.   On the same date the Home secretary reported that the opposition to  the&quot;Bolshevists, which was  so marked in this country,was fast disappearing.
    Italy. Sir R. Rodd 011 October 8th  reported  that,, as far  as  could be judged,Prince Ma.x&apos;s peace appeal aroused general mistrust in Italy.    With reference to the prospects of peace discussions with Turkey, Sir R. Roddon October 14-th indicated  the susceptibility of the Italian Government as affectingthe future of Smyrna, in view  of the apparent French claims in Syria.            ... *.    On. October 14th Italian Wireless  published a message to the Italian ambassador at Washington, quoting the attitude of the Italian Press before the issue of PresidentWilson&apos;s reply to the second  German  note (Herr solf&apos;s).  ddre general -opinion was&apos;that  the  conditions  of  an  armistice  should  comprise  all  indispensable., militaryguarantees.    Japan. On October  11th Sir 0. Greene reported the  selections made  in  thePress of nominees for Japanese representation at  the future Conference on  Peace.    Poland.-On October  10th Sir H..Rumbold  called attention to an article in theFrankfurter Zeitung of the 9th, giving the  interpretation by the Council of Regencyof President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points, as applied to&quot; Poland.    (See also under Sweden.)    Russia. In the event of  the possible sudden withdrawal of German, troops fromoccupied  territory, in  connection with  peace  discussions,  Sir  M. Findlay onOctober  10th supplied  information   pointing  to  the probability  of  excesses byBolsheviks, unless  prompt precautions we taken to replace the German forces by.others.  (See also under Esthonia., Sweden, and  Ukraine.)    Russian  Wireless  of  October 11th  and 14-th  contains critical references to president Wilson, and calls his fourteen points the &quot;fourteen commandments  of the modern Moses.&quot;           -                                                    ;.    Spain. Sir A. Hardinge  on October 12th indicated that an approach had beenmade by Sweden to Spain for  combined action  by neutrals  to guard  their interests.The approach is believed to have met with little response.    Sweden.  On October 11th Mr. Clive (Stockholm) drew attention to an article in Nya.  Dagligt Allehanda, proposing  that Sweden should maintain  order  in Esthonia,the Ukraine, Poland,  occupied  territory in Great  Russia,  and  Finland, if those territories should be subjected to terrorism by Bolsheviks in the event  of the with-clrawal of German troops,  ddie Social Demokralen strongly opposes  the  idea.  (see also under Esthonia, Russia, and Ukraine.)    Turkey. The present situation, as affecting peace appeals, is  somewhat obscure,and doubtless, for the time, dominated by German bayonets and German-manned warvessels.  Telegrams from Lord Granville (October 9th), Sir H.  Rumbold (l.lth-14th),Sir P. Cox (Teheran, 13th), Mr. Robertson (The Hague, 14th), Sir A, Hardinge (15th),a  Memorandum  by the Director of  Military  Intelligence  dated  October 2nd,  and information  dated  October 7th received from Berne by the Foreign Office, all point to an urgent desire of the Turkish Government for  peace.  The Sultan appears tohave  insisted to Talaat Pasha upon his  suing for peace as soon  as the news of the bulgarian  armistice was received, and this led to Talaaf s resignation.     Sir  A.  Hardinge (October  I5th) forwarded  the  text of  the  appeal from  theTurkish Government to  President Wilson  which was  handed to the Spanish  ForeignMinister in  Madrid on  October 13th,1  The  Spanish  Government was at the  sametime  asked to approach the President  in  order  to bring  about a general armistice.(The  appeal was published in the Press on October 15th-16th.)     On  October 15th  Sir H. Rumbold  indicated  on good  authority that German-manned war vessels of the  (late)  Russian Black Sea Fleet  were trying to get to constantinople, in order to stop the Turkish Government from bringing about peace.     United States. On  October 12th United States Wireless communicated to Romethe substance of articles in the  Press on  President WilsoiTs reply  to  Prince Max&apos;s appeal.     On  October 13th  Mr. Barclay reported the  arrival at the Swiss Legation of thesecond German appeal (Herr solf&apos;s) to President  Wilson.   (See under Germany.)   1  And to the Secretary of  State  at Washington by the Spanish Ambassador on October 14th(Mr. Barclay, 15th) apparently without comment.
Oa October loth.-] 6th  the  following  reply to that appeal was published in thePress : -Sir,The Department of State,   October 14th, 1918.      In  reply  to  the  communication  of  the  German  Government,  dated  the12th instant, winch  you handed me to-day, I  have the honour  to  request you to,transmit the followitig answer :     The unqualified  acceptance  by the present German Government and by a large majority of the  German Reichstag of  the terms laid down by the President of theUnited  States of America  in his addresses to the Congress of the United States onJanuary 8th,  .1918, and in his subsequent  addresses, justifies the -President in makinga frank  and  direct statement of  his decision in regard to the communications of theGerman Government  of the Sth and 12th of October 1918.    It must  be  clearly understood that the process of evacuation and the conditions-of an armistice are matters which must  be left to the judgment  and  advice of themilitary advisers of the Government of the United States and the Allied Governments,and the President feels it his duty to say that no arrangement can  be accepted by theGovernment  of  the United States which does not provide absolutely satisfactory safe-guards  and. guarantees of the maintenance of the present military supremacy of the armies of.  the United States and. of  the Allies in the field.  He feels confident that hecan safely assume  that  this will also  lie the  judgment and  decision of the  AlliedGovernments.    The President feels  that it is also his  duty  to add that neither  the Government ofthe United States nor, he is quite sure, the Governments with which  the Governmentof the  United  States is  associated, as  a  belligerent,  will consent  to consider an armistice so  long as the  armed forces of Germany continue the illegal and inhumane practices  wdiich  they  persist  in.   At  the  very  time  the German Government approaches the  Government of  the United States  with  proposals of peace its  sub- marines are  engaged in sinking passenger ships at sea, and not the  ships alone, but the very boats in wdiich  their passengers  and crews seek to make  their way to safety ;and in their present enforced  withdrawal  from Flanders and Prance the German armies  are pursuing a course of wanton destruction &quot;which has  always been regarded.as  in direct violation  of the  rules  and practices  of  civilised warfare.  Cities and. villages, if not destroyed, are being stripped not only of all they contain, but often of their very inhabitants.   The nations associated  against  Germany  cannot be expected. to agree to a cessation  of  arms  while acts of  inhumanity, spoliation, and desolationare being continued wdiich they justly  look  upon  with horror  and. with burning hearts.     It  is necessary also, in order that  there may be  no possibility of misunder- standing, that the President  should  very  solemnly call  the attention  of  the Government of Germany to the language and plain  intent of one of the  terms of peace  which the German Government  lias now accepted.   It  is contained in the -address  of  the President delivered  at  Mount Vernon on July 4th last.   It  is as follows :        &quot;The   destruction  of every  arbitrary power anywhere  that   can  separately,. -secretly,  and of its single choice  disturb the  peace of the world.; or if it cannot be presently destroyed, at least its reduction, to virtual impotency.&quot;      The power which  has hitherto controlled the German nation is of the sort here described.   It  is within the choice of the German nation to alter  it.   The Presidents words  just  quoted naturally constitute a condition precedent to peace, if peace is  to -come by  the action of the German people themselves.      The President  feels  bound to say  that the whole process of peace will, in his judgment,  depend  on the definiteness and satisfactory character of the guarantees wdiich can be given in this fundamental  matter.  It is indispensable  that the Govern- ments associated against Germany should  know beyond a peradventure wdth whom they are  dealing.      The President will make  a separate reply to the Royal and Imperial Government o f A u industries a-H u n gary.Accept-, Sir, the renewed assurances of my high consideration,ROBEIIT LANSING.
     On October 15th Mr. Barclay drew attention to the contents of  a  cable, said Whave been, despatched from London on  the 13th, which claimed to give the terms foran  armistice put by Marshal  Loch  at Versailles before the recent conference at versailles.   The.terms, according to the cable, affected Ooblentz, Metz, aud Strassburg ;.the works of Skoda and of Krupp ;  and the distribution of German war vessels amongstthe Allied Powers.     Ukraine. Sir M. Findlay on  October  15th forwarded the  opinion of a reliable-authority that the wdthclrawai of German troops, unless troops of the Entente replacedthem, would, lead to terrible Bolshevist massacres.     (See also under Eslhonia, Russia, and Sweden.)     Vatican.&apos; Reports from Sir R. Rodd (October  9th and Pith) and  Count de Salis.(10th) indicate the interest taken by the Pope in peace appeals, especially as affecting-Austria-Hungary.  He is reported to have communicated with President Wilson  on.the.subject on October 6th.
