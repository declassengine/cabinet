Enemy Countries (page 6). Austria-Hungary  is breaking up internally,- and  itis now a question whether the series of revolutions which have begun in the HapsburgEmpire  will  be  limited  to  political revolutions  or  whether  social and economicrevolutions will follow, bringing anarchy and chaos in their train.  This is the perilwhich faces any enemy Government which is  &quot; Too late.&quot;    The problem in  Germany is  the problem  of the attitude which will be adoptedby *&apos; a proud  people  accustomed to victory &quot; when faced with the certainty of defeatand humiliation.   The Gods of Modern Germany have failed Germany, the discipline and education  of  a generation are to be unlearnt.  Under such circumstances what can and what will be thb -objective of the German mind?    Neutral  Countries (page 9). Items of  interest in this section are the questions ofthe Danish attitude regarding Schleswig, and the Spanish difficulties in Morocco.     Peace Discussions (page 12). The armistice with, Turkey, contracted since thisReport passed the final proof stage, has eclipsed in interest all matter given underthis heading.   Appreciation of peace discussions is therefore deferred until the  nextReport.                                                                     W.  0.  G.     October 31st, 1918.

PART  II.-FOREIGN  AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.     Sinkings. The  Ministry  of  Shipping  reports  that  during the  week  ending October 19th six vessels of over 500  tons gross were sunk by enemy action  and three by marine risk.  Out of  130 ships convoyed  during the week, there was only one casualty to a homeward bound ship by enemy action.  Eleven convoys outward bound, consisting of 153 ships,  were escorted  through  the  danger  zone without casualty.   The nett loss  of British tonnage during the period amounted to 3,651 tons.     Effect of Armistice  on Enemy Merchant Ships. The Allied Maritime Transport Council and the Food Council have been considering the effect of an armistice upon the supply arrangements of the Allies.   Regarding the possibility of supplies hitherto excluded from  Germany passing  through the  blockade, and additional  supplies for neutral countries  and liberated populations being required, the Allied representatives agree that it is essential that arrangements should be  made through the Food Council and Programme Committees.   For this  purpose they consider that  all German and Austrian merchant ships  should  be placed under  the Allied  Maritime  Transport Council.   Otherwise it is considered that  the economic  position  would  be dislocated by  neutral or enemy countries being  able to enter the markets of the world and purchase supplies required for the vital needs of the Allies in competition with them.As  a first measure it is suggested that the enemy tonnage  now  in enemy or neutral ports should be  brought into use under Allied direction, the ultimate  disposition of the vessels being  left to the Peace Conference.     Enemy Ships in Neutral  Countries. The  importance of providing  for  the possibility of the transfer  of ships in German ports  to neutrals and for the Allied control of enemy  ships in neutral countries in the terms of the armistice  has been pointed out by the Board  of Trade,  ddiis  is  illustrated by the fact that  Spain  has acquired from Germany about 21,000 tons of shipping for the replacement of Spanish ships  lost  since  August 14th, though  the  British  Government has not yet recog- nised the transfer of flags.  In addition to the  above, 70 Spanish  ships were lost before August  14th,  and  the  Spanish authorities  may  endeavour  to compensate themselves from  the German ships in Spanish  ports.  The Netherlands  Government has already obtained about seven German ships.   Unless  provision  is made in  the armistice for handing over  enemy ships  in neutral  ports, or for the prevention of  the transfer of flags, this  method.of compensation may not be available.     Restoration of Devastated Areas. ddie Resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the French  Senate relating to  the restoration of the  devastation and damage caused by the  enemy to the populations  now being  liberated  by the Allies, was laid before the   Senate  on October  15th.  This Resolution,  which  was  adopted unanimously by  the  Senate,  calls on  the  Government to concert  wdth the Allied Governments and to pursue their enquiries with a  view  to  the condemnation of  the authors of  these breaches of  international law.   In  introducing  the  Resolution, M.  Couyba cpioted a German Army Order found on a  prisoner, ordering the German troops to carry out these instructions more methodically and with less  haste,  and stating that the wells should everywhere be  poisoned.  M.  Pichon, on behalf of  the Government, spoke in favour of the Resolution,  and repeated  the  solemn warning that Germany would be held responsible.     Evacuation of lDopulalion  in  Belgium and  France. Idle  Spanish Minister  at Brussels has reported upon the  evacuation of  the population in the military zones in France and Belgium.  It is stated by Relief delegates that  the  German milicary authorities furnished all assistance  for.personal inspection, and that everything is done to reduce the suffering of the people.  It is said that at  Tournai the populationrefused to make use of the railway facilities offered by the Germans.
     German View of Distress  in French Occupied Territory. Herr  Scheurmaim, in. the Deutsche Tageszeitung (October  lltli) writes  of the distress  in. French occupied territory as follows : &quot; We were endeavouring, by  our  peace proposal, to shorten the  sufferings  of those people who, as a  result of the war, have endured so many hardships ; &quot;but France and her Allies  are devastating territory which until now our military authorities had been able to spare.  It has already been reported that Douai and  Cambrai, two of the most flourishing towns of northern France, are in flames.  In these towns  irreplaceable works of  art  have been  destroyed, and great  economicdamage has been done, which will take years to reconstruct.&quot;     Exchange  of British and German Civilians. The Netherlands Minister at Berlin has  been informed that Flis Majesty&apos;s  Government is prepared, to agree to  exchange 1,600  German civilians in Holland for  the 400  British, plus 1,200 British civilians from Germany, or to  exchange the 1,600  Germans  for the 400 British on  condition that all the British  civilians in  Germany, including merchant seamen, are exchanged for the  same  number of  German civilians and merchant seamen now under British control.     Exchange  of British and  German  Military  Prisoners. The Butch Minister at Berlin  has conveyed to His Majesty&apos;s Government  the  statement of the German Government  that all  British officers and non-commissioned  officers  captured upto August 25th, 1916, are  interned in  Holland, and. that should  others who are eligible still be in Germany, they  will be transferred  immediately.   The German Government  intimate that they now expect the  transfer  to Holland of nine German officers and 100 non-commissioned  officers captured up to August 25th, 1916, before the transports stop running.     Treatment of Aviators Dropping Pamphlets. Having  observed the statement in the  Allgemeiner  Tyrol Anzelger that the  military   authorities  at  Innsbruck  have issued an order that  any enemy aviator dropping pamphlets renders himself liable to death, His Majesty&apos;s  Government has  enquired  whether the order  was  made by authority  of  the Austro-Hungarian  Government. ^ They intimate that if any British airman should be  executed, for an act  of the  character mentioned, two Austro-I tungarian flying officers will be executed as a reprisal.     The German Government  has announced that the order is withdrawn wherebyairmen who are captured with inflammatory pamphlets are brought to trial.ALLIED  GROUP.                                   BELGIUM.     Condition  of  Refugees. Sir F.  Villiers has informed the  Foreign Office that theFrench and Belgian Governments have  received very distressing reports  about thecondition of the refugees, and they are co-operating in a request to Holland to providetransport  immediately.   The  difficulties are  not in regard  to provisions, but  inrelation to  lodging accommodation, on account  of the  fact that  the  majority of available  houses  are still occupied  by the  Germans.   The Belgian Minister forForeign Affairs has not received intimation  that any British subjects are affected.     British Subjects in Belgium. The  Belgian Government has been asked for  an explanation as to why it should be necessary for persons to leave occupied territory,as relief supplies are being imported  as in  the past.   Inquiry  is also made as to whyBritish subjects should have to leave  before Belgians.                                    BRAZIL.    Epidemic at Rio. Sir A. Peel informed His Majesty&apos;s Government, on October24th, that a virulent form of epidemic had broken  out at  Rio causing thousands-of
deaths.   The situation has been  made more serious  by the lack of food supply, andhe points out that haying  regard to the great hospitality shown to the Mission inApril last, some assistance from Great Britain to relieve the distress among the poorerclasses would be highly appreciated.                                    CHINA.    Internal Situation. The dapanese  Minister  for Foreign Affairs  has  informed sir C. Greene  that  the Government  of Japan take the view  that Great Britain,France, Italy, the United States and Japan should jointly urge the  leaders of Northand South to settle their  differences  and restore peace  in  China.   The Ministerexpresses the belief that the leaders will  take  action if  given  a lead by the Powers.It is suggested  that it should be explained that the five Governments do not concern themselves in  the  exact  terms upon which  the differences  may be  adjusted, andassurances should  be given that the representation is of a friendly character.   TheJapanese  Government is  of opinion  that the suggestion previously  mack;  by BisMajesty&apos;s Government for putting final  pressure upon the contending  parties mightbe productive of more harm than good.    Duties as Co-Belligerent. The Allied Ministers in Peking  agreed on October 26thto interview the  President  and notify him of the failure of  China to carry out its duties as a co-belligerent.  It was decided to  point out the following amongst othermatters,  namely, that instead  of  using the  released  Boxer  indemnity and  surplusCustoms revenue for strengthening the  country  for war purposes, these  resources were wasted for partisan political purposes, and that brigandage  has been permitted to interfere with the administration of the railways and to injure the interests of theAllied Powers.   Many other points are dealt with in the Aide Memoire, including theinadecprate execution of treaty obligations.                                   FRANCE.    Attitude of the Socialists. Monsieur Jean  Longuet has  been appointed by theSocialist Part3* to represent them  on the  executive committee for the meeting of theInternational Conference.   As each country has the right to  two representatives onthis committee, M. Renaudel vainly endeavoured to have the second French  delegatechosen from the ranks of the former majoritaire group, but his  proposal was throAvnout  as  being in  disagreement  with  the decisions  of  the  London Conference.M. Jouhaux has been appointed to represent the Confederation Generale du  Travail.The  Socialist Commission,  of which MM.  Longuet,  Rappoport, and Levy  form, part,has been appointed  to .draw up  a manifesto against the &quot;Jingo campaign.&quot;  It  isreported that Longuet and  his followers are fomenting  distrust  of British intentionswdth regard to German Colonies,  and against British Imperialism as a whole.  Activepreparation is being made for  the  National Socialist Congress to   be  held  thismonth, and it is feared that the Longuet Party may become the directors of the Partyorgan  L&apos;Ilumanite.    Taking  front  the Germans  the  threadbare argument  that ireland, Egypt, and  India are oppressed  nationalities, striving for liberty,  Longuet iswarning his countrymen against the ambitions of  England  and Italy, and  is  pointingto the  seizure of  the German Colonies as a proof that the war has degenerated into a&quot;war  of conquest.  This attitude, it is said,  is unfortunately being taken up by peoplewdro will have  nothing to do with  Socialism, and it  may grow to be  a real clanger.The French are very ignorant regarding  British  colonisation to-day.   ddiey imagineit to  be a  scrt of paternal despotism in which no  kind of  individual liberty is allowed.  It is reported  that there is a great need for explaining to the French  how the question of returning  the German Colonies in Africa and the Pacific is  regarded in England, and what the British proposals  are regarding  Syria, Mesopotamia and palestine.     A manifesto has been  issued to the French  nation by the Confederation  Generaledu Travail, Ligue des Droits cle 1&apos;Homme Coalition Republicaine and French SocialistParty.   This  points out that  the members  of  the organisations  who  sign the manifesto have for four years given their assistance towards  defending their country
against brutal aggression, but that they demand that the nation shall not listen to theJingo  exhortation of a Press often more  docile to suggestions  of conquest than  to consideration of right.  The organisations state that  they represent the most activeforces of labour and democracy, and declare  their full agreement with the principlesformulated by President Wilson during  the  past fortnight, and  they point  out  thatthe President has excluded all spirit of conquest and  annexation, as he excludes anypeace in which right is abandoned.  The organisations further express their  belief that the French and Allied Governments and President Wilson will decide to make amost firm and wdse  reply, which will be solely  inspired, by  the  real interest of the peoples, to the  Central empire&apos;s request for  an armistice.  In commenting upon the manifesto the Temps and Debats both strongly disapprove  of the terms.   The Tempsdeclares that the French Socialist Party, which before  the war believed in Germany&apos;sgood intentions,  and in Bolshevist  Russia,  luckily can have but  little  prestige  orinfluence amongst the Allies.     Radical Socialist Congress. The  Radical  Socialist Congress  declined to  sign the  manifesto mentioned in  the  preceding  paragraph, and passed  the  following-resolution by a large majority : &quot; The Congress relying upon the  Allied governments and convinced that  the country which has given so many proofs of its  wisdom andsangfroid requires  no exhortation and will turn a deaf ear  to pernicious counsels,passed to the order of day.&quot;   Before dissolving, the Congress voted a highly patrioticmotion expressing joy at  the  imminent  return  of Alsace-Lorraine to  the flag  &quot; thethree colours of which  in 1789  were sewn together by the  people of Paris on thecrumbling walls of  the Feudal and  Royalist  bastille, and  which gloriously borne bychildren   of France led to  victory  all the  peoples  of Europe,  Asia,  Africa,  and america, who flocked round it because that  standard was the symbol of  UniversalRight  and  Liberty-.  The triumph of  that  flag is  the triumph of the  revolutionbegun  in the Summer of 1789 and  of which the  present war will have  been the lastand tragic act.&quot;                                    ITALY.    Attitude towards War. It was reported on October 21 st that there had been a gooddeal of anti-war agitation in Italy during the past two or three weeks,   The Mayor ofSirmione was arrested by the Carabmieri&apos; of Brescia, for having made anti-war state-ments.  The Army area is beset by rumours such as  that  when General Diaz visitedFrance Marshal Foch refused to send any help to Italy; and that this was the reason whythe offensive was delayed ; that the  Premier was visiting Paris to protest against Italy&apos;interests being sacrificed to those of France;  that the Italian offensive was  postponedowdng  to  the  Austrian peace  move.   Information received from  Berne shows that french and Italian anarchists are in constant correspondence with their  comrades  in italy.    When, the  German  demand for  an armistice  was  announced  in Florence, thepeople paraded the streets for many hours singing songs.   The demonstration appearsto have been organised by the Socialists.                                     JAPAN.    Policy in Siberia.- The  Japanese Government has intimated to His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment that, after  renewed  consideration of the question,  they  cannot modify their views as  to  the  impossibility  of extending westward their  military activitiesbeyond the limits of Eastern Siberia.  While strongly sympathetic with the  efforts of the Czech  troops, the Japanese  Government  has reluctantly  decided  that  theJapanese  troops  now operating east  of  Lake Baikal  shall  not  attempt  a furtherwestward   advance.   Commenting  on the above Sir  C.  Greene states  that  theJapanese Government regretted its inability to relieve the Czechs for military externaland internal reasons.  The  Government  considered that it would be wiser for  the czechs to withdraw to Omsk or any place of safety now than to run the risk involved by further fighting, more particularly  having regard to the possibility  of  the early-defeat of Germany.  Sir C. Greene adds that he represented to the Foreign Minister    6633 -5!)                               B
that Japan had, in his opinion, missed a great opportunity, and that he  feared  that failure to help in saving the Czechs from disaster would cause a  painful impression on the European Allies.  Sir C. Greene expresses the view that the fear of the UnitedStates is as strong an influence with the new Japanese Cabinet as with the old.                                 PORTUGAL.    Internal  Conditions. In  a  despatch  to  the  Foreign  Office last  month. SirL. Carnegie called attention to a plot that had been  discovered against the president and his Government in Almada, a small town immediately opposite  Lisbon, which,had it been undetected, might have led to serious consequences.  The difficulties arose from a meeting of the National  Work Union, an important Labour Association, whichpassed a resolution containing a large number of demands in regard to regulation ofprices and various social  questions.   The working classes w7ere invited to organisecommissions  at wdiich the resolution was to be discussed.   When the Almada plotwas investigated, it was found that these commissions were composed of conspiratorswho were to arrange for a simultaneous  outbreak of  revolution.  The Government atonce took steps to prevent  the commissions meeting, and in Lisbon and the surroundingdistricts a large number of arrests were made both of workmen and of  soldiers, and considerable quantities of  arms and  bombs were discovered by the police.  Some ofthe papers assert that the  Democrats  were behind this movement, and Sir L. Carnegiethinks that it was quite possible that some of  the Party were  implicated.  He doesnot think, howrever, that Dr. Costa or any of the leaders, however glad they might beto see President Paes overthrowm, would care about assuming the responsibilities ofgovernment at present.                       UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA.     Press  Comments  on Presidents  Note. Mr.  Barclay  informed  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  on October  25th that  Press  comments  on  the  Presidents Note,  toGermany were very favourable with one exception.  He states that the subjects mostwarmly praised&apos; are the announcements that the question of an armistice must be leftto the Allied military advisers, and the final paragraph, which is deemed to be a refusal to accept German assurances that there has been  any change in the Germanform of government.  The Press concludes  that the President will accept nothing butunconditional surrender from the present German Government.  The  Tribune is theonly paper which criticises the Note, and alleges that it  is a challenge to the allies to accept the Presidents peace terms.ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    Internal Conditions. The Admiralty reported (October 2Sth) asfolknvs regardingthe,internal situation in Austria : &quot; The Emperor is  bewildered and panic-stricken,Ministers make futile and platitudinous speeches to hostile and uproarious assemblies.The Imperial Manifesto of October l6th, announcing that  the Dual Monarchy is tobecome  a  Federal State  with autonomy for each race,  has fallen flat.   The Czecho-Slovaks  and the Jugo-Slavs decline to remain bound  in  any way to  the HapsburgCrown.  Their  representatives,  as well as those of the Poles and  the Galicians,.are reported to have withdrawn from the Reichsrath and to  be forming ConstituentAssemblies of their own.   This means the end of the Reichsrath and of the austrian government as such.   The Austrian-Germans of all  parties are  endeavouring to
strike  hack at the Ozecho-Slovaks by  demanding self-determination for  their owndistrict of Bohemia, knowing that by  so doing they  will jeopardise  the most vitalstrategic and economic interests of the new Gzecho-Slovak State,  ddrey are in favourof incorporation in Germany.  Hand-in-hand  with national  disruption  comes classwarfare  which,  reinforced  by the &quot;Bolshevist  peril now gathering  momentum in poland and East Galicia, will, if  allowed to develop, reduce  the  Dual Monarchy tothe level of Russia.  There  is nothing  to stop it except the Army,  and that is  anexceedingly unreliable factor.&quot;     With regard  to Hungary, Dr. Wekerle, the Prime Minister, has again resigned.It is reported that Counts Andrassy and Apponyi were sent for, but were  unable toform a, Ministry,  ddiere is a movement in favour of appointing  Count Karolyi, theSocialist (pro-Entente) leader in the Hungarian Parliament, as the  new Premier,  but whether  anyone has been actually appointed by the Emperor is at  present not clear.    Regarding  the  rapidity with wdiich the political situation  has developed  in hungary, Lord Acton  reports that the Department of the Military Attache at Bernelearns  that  Count Andrassy expressed  himself as astounded at the course of events.When  he left Budapest about ten days ago  even the Hungarian Opposition hardlydreamed of a complete separation from Austria.   It was taken for granted  that thetwo countries would  have,  at least, a  foreign policy in common.  Andrassy is nowconvinced that in future the only  link between the two countries will be the personalunion  of  the  Sovereign.  The Emperor realises that even this personal union  canonly be continued at the price  of  very  large  concessions to Hungary.  To keephis hold on the Hungarian Crown he is willing to throw over  the favourite. Austrianpolicy of creating a Jugo-Slav State as part of the Austrian Federation.  In the teethof  very  strong Austrian  opposition  he is ready to form Bosnia, Herzegovina,  andCroatia into a Federative State united to Hungary.     Fecleralisation Schemes. Lord Acton reported on October 24th that information had reached him to the effect that the Emperor of Austria&apos;s recent proposal had beenaccepted by the people of Eastern Galicia  and the Bukovina, who had declared theirunion  in one State connected federally wdth  the rest of Austria.  In Vienna it was stated that the opinion prevailed  that Western Galicia was lost to Austria.     President Wilson&apos;s  Peply. ddre   Vienna correspondent  of  the Lohalanzeigertelegraphed (according to  a Berlin wire via Amsterdam) on October 23rd : &quot; PresidentWilson&apos;s reply to Austria-Hungary, which became known in Vienna on Monday, hasmade  a  deep impression in German circles.  There is indescribable joy among the czechs over  President WilsoiPs insistence that the Austro-Hungarian government must  now settle with  the  Czech National Council as with a factor enjoying equalrights.&quot;     German Austria and Germany. Lord Acton reports that information has reachedthe Swiss  Government that the  German Ambassador  at Vienna  is working for theunion  of German Austria with the German Empire, and that German propaganda isagitating on these lines.  Representatives of the  Majority Socialists are in Austria forthe purpose  of working with the German Austrian Socialists on  the subject.   Thereason for this attitude is stated to  be the desire  to  be in a position to  show an equivalent gain of territory to replace  the probable  loss of Alsace-Lorraine and thePolish provinces of Germany.     &quot;Pertinax &quot; declares in Echo de Paris that it will  be impossible to prevent  theGerman-Austrians from joining Germany.  The  Neue Freie Presse  raises a  plea forthe consideration of the hard lot of the  German-Austrians.  It represents  them as-coming  into  the  category  of  oppressed  nationalities,  and  asks   why, now  thatMr. Wilson  has been subject to the  influence of  the  Czecho-Slovaks, Poles,  andJugo-Slavs, these Germans should not lay before him the story of their hardships.                                  GERMANY.     Internal  Conditions. Sir  W. Townley reported on&apos; October 24th that reliable information had  reached him to the effect  that the  internal  conditions in  germany were becoming daily more serious.  Rumours  were prevalent regarding daily riots,which had to be met by force, and the work of the &quot;production of munitions had been
seriously interfered  with.  It is even said that Krupps  had been forced to dismiss17,000 workmen out of a total of 4-3,000.   The Dutch Minister for Foreign  Affairsuttered a grave warning to Sir W. Townley on  October 22nd as  to the danger of bolshevism  in Germany if the Entente Powers persisted in making  the  bargain- sohard  that Germany could not accept  it.  The Minister urged that the clanger was  a real one, and  that if the flame of  Bolshevism were  ignited it was  impossible to saywhere it would stop, as he wras convinced  that the leaders of the-Democratic Parliesin Germany,  Holland, France and Italy  would  be  entirely unable to control their followers.    Lord Acton reported  from  Berne on October 24th that the Department of theMilitary Attache learnt from a source in close touch with the German Legation thatthe members  of the German  and Austrian Legations  are haunted by the fear of an outbreak  of Bolshevism, or  at  any  rate  of  revolutionary  socialism.   They  aretherefore hurriedly having large sums of  money sent from Germany and  Austria bythe diplomatic courier  for investment in Switzerland.  It was gathered  from anothersource that the people in the Rhine towns  are more and more haunted by  the spectreof invasion.   Many  of them  have  taken  their money out of the banks and  fled to berlin.  Lord Acton also  reported on October 22nd  that information had  reached him that conditions in  Germany, both political and  economic, had  altered for Preworse in a most startling way during the last six weeks.   The food situation  had become more unendurable than ever.   Even wdth money it was hardly possible to getany eatable  food at  all.   The change in the feelings of the  people was stated to be most  astounding,  and the  behaviour of  the  soldiers in  Berlin  very  remarkable.Discipline was almost at  an end ; the men  no longer saluted their officers and loungedand smokeddn their presence.  The  population  generally had  lost their respect forthe Army.   The statue of Hindenburg was  quite deserted and the flowers  round  itwere  left to  wither.  A statue  of Hindenburg put up at Dresden since the beginningof the war  had been  removed  altogether because  it gave  rise to so many hostiledemonstrations.    Professor Foerster, of  Munich, has just returned  to Switzerland from Germany,and has stated that the German people are in a  very  bewildered state.  They7  vaguelyrealise that things are not going  well with them, but  they7 do not know wdiat is wrong.They also vaguely realise that they are generally unpopular, but they  do not know7why.   This, he  says, is not  entirely7 their  own fault.   They  are  much more read)7  to listen to criticism than they were earlier in the  war, when the idea that Germany  wasin any way  responsible for beginning the war was  treated as altogether  beyond thepale of serious  discussion.  As  regards the prospects of reform, Professor Foersterdeclared that things had reached  a  deadlock.   The  only7  men  with the energy  ofcarrying through reforms are still mobilised at the front.  The people at home are too old, and either too obstinate or too feeble  to initiate anything.  Even the  menreturning from the front had  no innate political instinct, and there wras great danger that  they would plunge  Germany into a  state  of aimless Bolshevism.  Foerster didnot  believe  that  Germany was ripe for  a republic.   Fie admitted the  extremeunpopularity  of the Emperor, but he  did  not believe  that  there was any  general desire to unseat the dynasty-.     Constitutional Reforms. The irmoposal of the Majority Parties as to  placing theCivil  authority over  the Military  in Germany7 was published  by  Vorwarts  onOctober 26th.  According to this, Article XI. of the Imperial Constitution  will be amended as follows : &quot; The  assent of the Federal  Council  and of the Reichstag  isrequisite for a declaration of war in the name of the Empire.  Peace  treaties as wellas  those treaties with Foreign States Avhich relate to subjects of Imperial legislationrequire the approval  of the  Federal Council and  the  Reichstag.&quot;   The  followingw7orcls are  to be  added in Article XV. : &quot; For his.  office  the Imperial Chancellorneeds the confidence of the Reichstag.  The Chancellor  bears the responsibility forall acts of  political significance that the Kaiser undertakes in  the  exercise of thepowers  appertaining  to  him  under  the  Imperial Constitution.  The  ImperialChancellor  and his representatives are responsible to the Federal Council  and theReichstag for their conduct of office.&quot;  The following sentence  is  to be  added  to article LILT : &quot; The appointment, transference,  promotion, and  dismissal of officersand  officials  of  the  Navy take  place under  the Imperial  OhancelloFs  counter-signature.&quot;   Dealing  with  the  amendment  to  Article XL of the Constitution, StateSecretary Herr GrOeber  said : :i I have to declare that if  these proposals are passed,the Government  will  support  them in  the  Federal  Council.   The  amendment
of  Aitide  XT.  meets an  old demand  of the  Reichstag.  The -responsibility  forwar cannot be laid on the shoulders of any single person, however conscientiously hemay fulfil his tasks,   ddiis tremendous and boundless sacrifice of blood and treasuremust be borne by the whole nation.  The war can only be waged to-day if it is a realpeople&apos;;? war.  It follows therefore that the Parliaments full assent is  requisite forwar, as also conclusion of  peace,  ddie voting of supplies itself constitutes a legalbasis for the responsibility  of  the Reichstag and the Chancellor.   The military power in peace time and the conduct of war remain as before in the hands of the Kaiser.&quot;     After  the discussion in the Reichstag on October 26th upon the proposal of theMajority parties amending Article XI. of the Imperial Constitution, the IndependentSocialists proposed an addition to Article XV.  to the effect that the Chancellor should submit to the Reichstag, at least once yearly, a  report on the situation, of the german empire and its international relations.     German Wireless of October 25th announced that the Reichstag passed a vote of &apos;confidence in the Government with  193 votes  in favour  and 52  votes  against and23 members who declined  to  vote,  ddie Conservatives and  the  Independent social democrats voted determinedly against the vote of confidence.  The Poles abstained.from voting,  ddie Reichstag further passed at  their second reading the  government bills for the change of constitution, together with the supplementary Bills brought inby the Parliamentary Majority, as a consequence of which, in future, every declarationof war and every conclusion of  peace,  without exception, will be subject to  theapproval of the Reichstag and the Bundesrat.   The same thing applies to Bills withrespect to Imperial legislative  affairs.     Imperial Chancellor&apos;s Speech. Prince  Max of Baden spoke in the Reichstag onOctober 22nd, when he asked  the  House to  observe  reticence on account of  thenegotiations between the German Government and President Wilson.  He stated thatthe country must be prepared for an unfavourable answer, and in that case therewould  be no choice for Germany but to place herself in a posture of defence with allthe strength of the people driven to the last extremity.  No peace of violence on either side would be submitted to by the Government  or by the nation.   The decision of theGerman people  must be based not on  the standard  of strength but  on what isconsidered by both sides to be right.   This departure from a traditional point of view he described as &quot;a great  effort for a proud  people accustomed to victory.&quot;  TheLeague of  Nations could not be  realised, he  asserted,  unless  the German peopleabandoned their national egoism,  which, up  to a short  time ago, was the dominantforce of their political life.   Much opposition would no doubt  be encountered before ajust  peace could  be obtained.  But now that Germany had  definitely liberated herselffrom her old system, she would he equal to the task either of war or peace.   PrinceMax then reviewed the recent measures of reform, catalogued in  the German Note ofthe 20th.   He announced that a new  system of  government had  been established inAlsace-Lorraine, and that the principal officials  were now Alsatians.     Views of Hindenburg and Duclendorff. The Kolnische Zeitung of October 25th, -in its report of LedebouPs  speech in the  Reichstag, stated that  the  speaker pointedout that the War Minister&apos;s assertion that the Army wras not beaten did not tally with the fact that Hindenburg and Ludendorff had  expressed their opinion in Berlin that immediate peace was a necessity.NEUTRAL GROUP.                                 ARGENTINE.    Proposed  Declaration  of  War upon Germany. His Majesty&apos;s Government has informed Sir R. Tower that as it is believed that the Argentine is prepared to break offrelations with Germany, it is proposed to state the requirements as follows: (1) Thatthe enemy ships  should be put  into approved trades  on some  terms which would    6633-5b      -                       C
preclude  payment  to Germany and prevent them,  being returned to Germany afterthe  war ;   (2) the transfer  of the  concession of the German  Electricity Company ;(3) the elimination  of  the  German Coaling&quot; Depot and  other enemy firms;  (1) thecomplete suppression of the German sabotage  service and expulsion or internmentof its agents ; and (5) control of  the wooJ output so  as  to  prevent Germany  gettingit after the war.  It is pointed out that as a means of  influencing the policy of theArgentine the British have (1) the relative independence of the Argentine wheat crop;(2) control of jute ;  (3) evidence that German agents by  delaying  the  ships  for theAllies are also injuring Argentine interests, &amp;c.  It is pointed out that agreement tothe  requirements  mentioned  would involve a  declaration  of war upon Germany.In.  reply  Sir B. Tower has  informed His Majesty&apos;s Government that  the Presidentof the Republic has apparently not been influenced  by the successes  of the Allies,and he expresses  the view that the Government  wdll  not voluntarily take actionagainst Germany in. regard to seizing vessels, &amp;c.   The  British representative pointsout that the methods of influencing the Argentine  are in the direction of assertingBritish independence  of Argentine wheat and  withholding jute bags for  the  nextcrop.  It  is  believed, hov-ever, that it wdll  be essential for the United States to actwith His Majesty&apos;s Government.  &quot;The view is  also expressed by Sir R. Tower that-if Chile could  be  induced to  declare  war  upon Germany,  the Argentine wouldprobably follow suit.                                  DENMARK.     Schleswig Question. Lord kilmarnock has informed His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat the Danish  Minister for Foreign Affairs has sent a Resolution passed by theRigsdag at a Secret Session (vide Report No.  91)  to the following  effect: after hearing the report of the Ministry, the joint meeting of the Rigsdag declares there is general agreement on the following points:  That the policy of unbiassed neutralitytowards all sides,  to which the whole Danish people have given their adherence, shallbe continued.   That no alteration of Schleswig&apos;s present position, other  than  a  settle-ment in accordance with  the principle of nationality, corresponds wdth the wishes,feelings and interests of the  Danish people,  and that at  the  approaching fulfilment of the principle of nationality7 right of self-determination of peoples which has been recognised by both belligerent parties, it is desired that a solution be brought aboutin such manner that no damage is  done to relations wdth either side, thereby assuringthe future security of reunion.     The Foreign Minister observes that the  Rigsdag  considers that the time has notarrived for the country to take any initiative, but  that it wishes to express  its view.Both the  Rigsdag and the  Danish Government  consider the  solution on the lines suggested in the Resolution as the  only one wdiich  can be of a lasting character.     Lord  Kilmarnock  points out that, notwithstanding the Rigsdag Resolution,intrigue respecting the Schleswig question still continues.  The agitation in favour  of raising  the  matter has been furthered by certain members of the Government, with at any rate the knowledge of the  Foreign Minister, wdio prevented the King fromlearning the facts.                                   FINLAND.    Position of the Government.- It has  been reported to  the  Foreign Office  thatthe French Note breaking off diplomatic  relations has had the effect of undermining the pro-German elements in the Finnish  Government.   Rumours have  been spreadregarding  the  possibility  of  a   reconstruction  and  the omission of  the leadingpro-German members in order to constitute a Monarchist Government which  wouldbe more agreeable to the Allies, though still in touch with Germany.   It is suggestedthat a British  statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government will  not recognise Finnishindependence  unless the notion of acquiring a German  monarch is abandoned,  wouldhave a  good effect.  It is stated that there  is no  doubt that Finland is  at heartRepublican, and the Monarchist  papers are inclined to agree to a general election inorder that Finland  could  attend the Peace  Conference wdth  a  stable  Government.Reports have appeared in  the Swedish Press foreshadowing a reconstruction  of theGovernment and the formation of a coalition of all the bourgeois parties.
                                LUXEMBOURG.     Evacuation of Territory. The Luxembourg Minister for Foreign  Affairs  has-conveyed the  hope of his Government that, in the event of the Germans evacuatingoccupied territory, all  Luxembourg  will also  be set free.   In  view of the country&apos;sneutrality, the  hope is expressed that  the German retreat  will  not take place acrossLuxembourg territory, and  that when  the army that invaded the country in defiance of treaties shall  have  left,  it may be possible to rely upon  the  support of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in obtaining greatly needed supplies.                                   MEXICO.    Confiscation of Oilfields. Mr. Thurstan  transmits  information  to  the  effectthat it is highly probable that there is an  agreement  between  the  Mexican and.German  Governments  for the confiscation of the oilfields belonging  to subjects ofGreat Britain and the United States, and their exploitation by Germans.    Carranza and  Government Troops. Mr. Thurstan has informed  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment that, owing to serious  differences between Carranza and  Murguia (theCommanderdn-Chief of the Government troops in Chihuahua), it is probable that  thelatter will shortly rebel if Villa is willing to support him.  This course would havea considerable effect, as Murguia has the largest armed force in the country.                                 NETHERLANDS.     Reply to the United States Note. The Netherlands Government have publishedtheir reply to the United States  Note to the following effect: On the eve of Londonnegotiations  the. offer  has  been noted with particular interest.   Scrupulous  maiii-tenance of the Netherlands&apos; neutrality which, under  difficulties and  sacrifices,  hasbeen made  to  serve the interests of humanity in general, gives them the right to continue assurance of the existence of the people as far as this is dependent on other-persons.  If  the United  States offer is a recognition of this, the Netherlands Govern-ment express their thanks.  But as the question of use of  Dutch tonnage, which  willbe  dealt with  in  London,  is involved,  and  as the  British Legation has  announced his Majesty&apos;s Governments assent to the United States offer, the Netherlands Govern-ment considers the matter is one for  negotiation in London and has so instructed itsdelegates.  Those  negotiations would show &quot; what  use  can be made of the offer witha view to requirements and to line  of  conduct which the Netherlands must observe inconnection with their position.&quot;     Danger of Violation of Territory. The  Prime  Minister made a statement in theSecond Chamber on October 23rd,  in which he pointed out that as the war had now reached the immediate neighbourhood of the Dutch Southern frontiers, the danger ofthe violation  of Dutch territory  had greatly  increased,  ddie  Government, therefore,considered  it essential to improve the defences of  the  country, and all military leavehad been suspended.   The  Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed the hope that  this action would not  be taken as  involving  any change in regard  to either groups ofbelligerents.     Germans crossing Dutch Frontier. His Majesty&apos;s Consul  at Terneuzen reportedthat 680 German soldiers crossed the Dutch frontier near Eede and have presumablybeen interned.  The Minister  for Foreign  Affairs has  given assurances that  all necessary measures have been taken, and that all soldiers entering Dutch territorywill be interned, though he pointed out the difficulty of  doing this effectively if  theGermans tried to make a short cut through Holland in considerable numbers.                                  NORWAY.    General  Election. A  General  Election  took place on  October  22nd.   ddieRadical Government, under  the leadership of M. Guimar Kundsen, which had been
in power since the beginning of 1913, had its  majority further increased at the 1915elections, but the present  elections have resulted, so  far as is at present known,  in large gains for the Conservatives at the expense of the Liberals.   It is believed  thatno party will possess an absolute majority, that the Liberals and Conservatives will beabout equal, and that the Socialists will  not materially  alter their  position.   the conservatives  are stated to have been taken by surprise, and would prefer to  have astrong minority to an actual majority for the  next few years.  If the elections resultin their having a majority over the liberals it is probable a Coalition Governmentwill be formed.  The elections  turned against  the Government principally upon thequestions of the liquor control, language reform, and absence of firmness in  foreignpolicy, especially in relation to  the submarine campaign.     The Sailors&apos;&apos; Union and U-Boats. The Sailors&apos; Union  at Christiania passed aresolution on  October 22nd  declaring  that  the  Union had  always looked upon theU-boat war against sailing ships with scorn and loathing.   The Union  has  requested the Government  to  try and obtain reparation Tor the losses caused  to Norwegiansailors and their families by these  illegal methods of warfare.     Compensation for U-Boat  Damage. The President of the Odelsting writes in hisorgan, Voelgeren : &quot; Peace must not only give reparation to Belgium, Serbia,  and theother little peoples which have been attacked, but also to the small neutral nations which have  been made to feel the consequences of war  to  such a terrible extent.Norway especially, which  through the inhuman and illegal U-boat war  has had  suchheavy loss of  ships and human lives, has a rightful claim for restitution, and we trust.that the Allies will understand  our righteous demands and see that they are  carried through.&quot;                                     SPAIN.     Seizure of German SMjds. According  to  German Wireless of October 21th, theSpanish  Government  stated officially  that  a friendly  communication  had  beenreceived from the German Government authorising the use of seven German steamers(21,000  tons) in  substitution  of  those  sunk.   Regarding the Note of the SpanishGovernment  concerning the  replacing  of sunken  mercantile  Spanish vessels by german vessels now lying in  Spanish waters,  the Norddeutsehe  Allgemeine Zeitung-writes : &quot; The Note from the  Spanish Government is caused by  the scarcity of ship-space which is necessary  for the  needs of  Spain.  In Germany,  these difficulties are met wdth benevolent understanding.&quot;   Sir A. Hardinge, in a despatch of October 13th,stated that when he saw  the Prime Minister on October 12th the statement as to the intended seizure of some five or seven German ships was  confirmed,  and he  added.that  the Germans knew what was proposed, and there would be no rupture of relations.     Position of Government. In the  despatch of Sir A. Hardinge to which reference is  made  in the  preceding  paragraph, the  following observations occur as to  theposition of the Government: &quot; The Government has decided to remove in a few days&apos;time the new  restrictions imposed on  the Spanish Press; it will,  indeed, be difficultonce the Cortes reassemble to maintain them.  It is prepared for a vigorous defenceof its foreign policy, and would,  I  suspect, carry  the country with it.   Once  theBudget has  been  voted,  especially  if  peace is restored in Europe,  the NationalCoalition  Government will consider  its task  completed, and a  Party Ministry will again be formed, perhaps  representing a union of the three moderate Liberal factions,.with Count Romanones, wdiose  prestige has  a  good deal increased ever since his pro-Ally policy has been shown by  events to be  a  sound one, at  its  head.  As the  war,Avhich tended  to promote the union of parties in Spain, appears to be  approaching itsclose, there is among all  the  party politicians an increased desire to  shake off thedull  control of a National Non-Party Government and to face, under their respectivehostile flags, the  new problems which the European conflict  wiU even  here have leftas &apos; embarrassing legacies.&apos; &quot;     The principal interest connected, with  the recent sittings of the Cortes is  statedin the Press to have lain in the attacks of  the Socialist Deputy,  Senor Prieto, on the
King and  Government.   His indictment of  the  Government  was  based  on  theirfailure to carry out their own decision  in  regard to the seizure of German shipping.The speaker pointed out that &quot;no  satisfactory explanation  had. been, offered for the -humiliating acceptance of seven German ships instead of the seizure of all.     Position in Morocco. It is reported that the entire Spanish zone of Morocco is ina state of anarchy, with the exception of the region of Melilla   Raisuli is in controlof the western district, where he maintains a Spanish officer  and several soldiers in prison.   The Spanish troops  have to obtain their supplies from Spain, as Raisuli hascut off all supplies from the interior.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.       (N.B. Countries arc arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)    General.   Chief interest is now centred dn the communication to  the associated powers by the Secretary of State at Washington, on behalf of President Wilson, ofthe German  peace notes of October Oth, .14th,  and 22nd,  and President AVdsoiFsreplies of the Sth, 14th, and 23rd.   The  granting.of an armistice is  dependent, inPresident Wilson&apos;s  opinion, upon  whether such an armistice is considered to bepossible from the point of view of the military situation.    Austria-Hungary. A further report has been received (Lord Acton, October 24th)indicating  that  the  Emperor Charles promised  the  Kaiser  not to  make peaceseparately.    The following  text of the Austro-Hungarian reply to President Wilson&apos;s note ofOctober 18th Avas received from Sir W.  downley on October 28th:     &quot; In answer to Presidents Note  of 18th instant  addressed to Austria-hungary and in  accordance with Presidents  decision to treat question of armistice and peaceseparately  with Austria-Hungary,  Austro-Hungarian  Government has  honour to declare that it  agrees as  with Presidents former declarations, so  also  with the views expressed in his last Note  concerning  the rights of the peoples of Austria-Hungary,especially of Czecho-Slovaks  and Jugo-Slavs.   As, therefore,  Austria-Hungary has accepted all.  conditions on  which President  has made  opening of negotiations forarmistice and peace depend, Austro-Hungarian Government considers nothing stands in the  way  of  such negotiations  being  opened.  Austro-Hungarian  government therefore declares  itself  ready without awaiting  the result  of  other negotiations to commence  negotiations for /peace between Au-stria-Hungary and the opposing Statesand for universal armistice on all Austro-Huugarian fronts and requests the president to take introductory steps accordingly.&quot; ANORASSY.    (See also under Germany.)    Belgium. The  Foreign Office  learns (2289,  October 28th) that President Wilsonincluded Belgium among the Associated  Powers to which  he  forwarded the text ofhis correspondence with the German Government about peace terms and an armistice.The Belgian Government  is anxious to act in agreement wdth the British and french governments in these matters.    Denmark. Lord  Kilmarnock  (October  29th)  reported  steps taken by TradesUnionists to promote action by the Internationale  in order, to  induce Labour in allcountries to stop the war.    France. Lord Derby on  October 23rd called attention  to an article by M. Hervein Vicioire,  giving  an  opinion  upon  indispensable  conditions  for  granting an armistice.  These  conditions  are of  a drastic nature,  involving  the  withdrawal ofPrussian  forces over the  Rhine, and  of enenw armies from all occupied territories.    6633 5b                                U
A buffer State to be formed on the left bank of tbe Rhine.  Terms to be imposed  by-Marshal Foch without  prejudice  to  those imposed  by  the  British  Admiralty.On October 24th-25th Lord Derby forwarded further extracts from the French Press.M.  Sembat, in UHeure, again  deprecates  the  &quot;detestable  practice&quot;  of separateresolutions, and  again presses for joint  action  on  the part of the  Allies.   TheEcho de Paris supports Mr. BalfouFs statement that the German  colonies should notbe returned.  The Populaire criticises.  On tbe question of the overtures by Germanyto President Wilson, the general view of the Press (October 24th) was that &quot;lightningoffensives and measures  of destruction having failed, she invites  the peoples, whomshe sought to  crush, to a philosophic discussion under the Presidency of Wilson.&quot;     Germany. According, to reliable information received from Lord Acton (October26th) the German peace policy is varying as  the military position changes, and with the  KaiseFs  altering moods.   The  Political Intelligence  Department,  in a usefulprovisional note,  dated October  21st (G/P. 6075), on the  German reply to PresidentWilson  as  regards  constitutional changes in Germany, in  connection  wdth  peaceovertures, showed that the sovereignty of the Federal Council over the German Empirewas  unimpaired.   German Wireless for  the wreek contains the usual claims thatdemocratisation has  been established.     According to a  report  from Berne, it  is now assumed  in Berlin (October 29th)that  Austria-Hungary will make peace separately, and the  consequences resultingfrom such a peace are attracting chief attention.     Lord  kilmarnock  on  October  29th  forwarded an  alleged German view of  the&quot; Freedom of the Seas,&quot;  amounting to the abolition of what are generally understood as belligerent rights.     On October  23rd (received  29th) Lord Acton reported on good  authority theopinion of the swiss Government that the German Government realises that a national,defensive war is an  &quot;unpractical dream.&quot;     Great, Britain. Tt has been pointed out in a Foreign Office  memorandum that, if germany and the Allies  agree to an armistice on  zhe  lines laid down  by PresidentWilsoiFs last  message, the  Associated Governments would be bound to certain termsat the subsequent  Peace  Conference.   For instance, an  armistice which Germany accepted on President Wilson&apos;s terms might be construed as committing His Majesty&apos;s Government to alterations in maritime law to which it woidd be impossible for them to adhere.  (See also under Germany.)     The Ministry of Labour report (week ending. October  23rd) that Labour opinion on the PresidenPs notes is as usual hopelessly divided.     Holland. Sir W. Townley on October 24th gave a summary of the Dutch Press comments on the German repby to President WilsoiFs note.  The Niewe Rotter damsel te Gourant states that it ought  to have contained Germany&apos;s ultimate terms, or at  any rate &quot;terms  wdth a hint  that she would go further if necessary.&quot;  The Tijd states that the parties are clearly7 not much nearer together.      Italy. Sir R. Rocld on October 23rd gave the substance of official comment on the German Note, which document  &quot; reveals  the usual  astuteness of procedure,  and should be received  with diffidence.&quot;      On October  24th a message was sent by Wireless to the Italian Ambassador in Washington  giving the forecast  in Italian political circles of President  WilsoiFs probable reply, and expressing the opinion that the enemy must, without subterfuges, recognise that the civilised world is the conqueror.      Lithuania. It has been suggested  through Lord  kilmarnock (October  23rd) that, in order to meet the Bolshevist danger in  Lithuania, when evacuated by German troops, the Allies  ought  to  stipulate  in armistice or peace conditions that, before evacuation, the Germans must  give  back to the Lithuanian authorities who take their place the  arms of which they have been deprived under the German regime.      Portugal. The Foreign  Office learns (22S9, October 28th) that President Wilson included  Portugal  among the Associated Powers to which he forwarded the text of his  correspondence with  the  German  Government  about  peace  terms  and  an armistice.
     Rumania. Steps have again been taken to publish in Rumania-the fact that HisMajesty&apos;s Government has no intention of making any territorial arrangements withthe Bulgarian Government until the general peace settlement (F.O. 321, October 29th).     Switzerland. Lord Acton reported on very good authority on October 26th thatthe Federal Council, after debating  for an hour and  a half, decided that the swiss government should not add a note giving  their  support to the  first German note to president Wilson.     Turkey. There are  indications (Sir R. Wingate, October 30th) that, through the sheikh Senussi, Turkey may make a claim  at the Peace Conference for the evacuation by Italy of territory in Tripoli.     United States. The  Foreign  Office received from Mr. Barclay during the.evening of October  24th the text of a  note from the Secretary of  State, covering copies of: theGerman  Notes  of October 6th, 14th, and  22nd to President Wilson, and replies ofOctober 8th, 14th, and  23rd.   The President asks for the  views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment upon  the correspondence, especially as affecting the  armistice proposedin the last-mentioned,  note.   Attention is called  to  the  proviso  that such a proposalfor an armistice is subject to the possibility of that course from the point  of view ofmilitary  considerations,  and  attention is also drawn to the Presidents endeavours tosecure carefully the interests of the people engaged  in war with the German Empire.The  President  hopes that His Majestj7&apos;s  Government will agree to  co-operate inthe suggested steps.
