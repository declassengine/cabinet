SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT  No. 93.                      PART  II.-FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.                              PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.    Since the issue of the last Report hostilities against Austria-Hungary have heenbrought to an end by the  acceptance of the conditions of armistice laid down by theSupreme War Council on  behalf the Allies.   Following rapidly upon this  happyconclusion, the Supreme War Council  have  dicussed and agreed  to terms of an armistice  to  be presented  to Germany in the  event  of the German Governmentsending a request  for an  armistice  to Marshal  Foch  and  Sir Rosslyn Wemyss.Further,  the  Allies  have accepted President  Wilson&apos;s  peace conditions with twonotable qualifications.  First, they reserve to themselves absolutely the right todiscuss the interpretation  to be placed  upon the &quot; Freedom  of  the  Seas,&quot; and theBritish representatives have made  it clear that  they  decline to be bound  by anydefinition  which  does not  satisfy  them.   Second,  they demanded  reparation orindemnity for all damage  done&apos; by  the enemy  to  civilian property.  The secondqualification has been accepted by President Wilson, and notice of both qualificationshas been intimated by him to the  German Government.    The most remarkable extract under this heading  in this Report is  the  appealissued by  the German Government  to the German people on November 5th.  this appeal contains the following phrase, &quot; the Government, and with it the Command ofthe Army and  Navy, wish  for peace.   They  wish it  sincerely and  they  wish itspeedily.&quot;  If words mean anything in Germany, these words mean the end.                                                                  W. 0. G.

PART  II.-FOREIGN  AND GENERAL.GENERAL.     Sinkings. The  Ministry of  Shipping  reports that  during the  week  ended October 26th no British vessels were sunk by enemy action.   Three vessels of  ] 1,411 gross tons were, however, lost by marine peril.  There were  no British ships  of any kind lost by enemy attack in October after the 21st of that month.     Prisoners of War in Belgium. Sir W.  Townley has  been informed  that His Majesty&apos;s Government  hope to  provide the Netherlands  Legation at  Brussels  wdth 210,000 Belgian francs  every month,  for the relief of British prisoners of  war  in Belgium.     Invalids repatriated  from Germany. Sir W. Townley has been instructed to ask the Netherlands Government to protest strongly to  Germany against  the neglect  of British  prisoners who were repatriated  on August 29th from Wittenberg.  These prisoners  were  seriously neglected.   The  men  were verminous,  and  the paper bandages with -which their wounds wrere dressed  were  seldom changed.  The  food was bad, and medical supplies were lacking.     Repatriation  of  Officers  and  Men  of the  Mercantile  Marine. His  Majesty&apos;s Government has intimated to the German  authorities that the agreement  regarding the repatriation, of officers and men of the Mercantile Marine over the age of  45 must be adhered to.   The British authorities will therefore send  23 merchant officers and 50 seamen in expectation of reciprocity.     Treatment of Aviators dropping Pamphlets. Regarding the treatment of airmen prisoners by reason of  their dropping  pamphlets, His Majesty&apos;s  Government has intimated  to Germany that Lieutenants Scholtz  and Wookey are  apparently still under sentence of 10 years&apos; penal servitude, and demand is made for  the immediate quashing of this sentence.     Troops  in  Lord Mayors Procession. His Majesty&apos;s  Government has  informed the Governments of France, Belgium, Japan, Greece, China,  &amp;c, that the influenza epidemic has rendered it  unwise  to receive contingents of  Allied troops in London, and that the invitation for contingents to  take  part in  the Lord Mayors procession has therefore been regretfully withdrawn.  It is pointed,  out that only troops  of the United States, Portugal, Italy, and Serbia wdio are already in  the United  Kingdom will be able to take part.     Transfer  of Enemy  Ships  to Neutrals. The question  of  providing for the possibility of the  transfer of German  ships to  neutral  firms in the terms  of the armistice (vide Report-No. 92) was raised at  the  Versailles Council, and  the general sense was favourable to -&quot;action being taken on the lines suggested by  the  President-of  the Board of Trade.ALLIED  GROUP.                                   BELGIUM.    Neutrality  and  Securities  for   Independence.-At  an  interview  betweenBaron  Moncheur  and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on  October 25th,it  was  intimated  that  the  Belgian  Government  desired  that  the   country should be  freed from the neutrality provisions  of the Treaty of 1839, and also thatsecurities should be provided  for enabling Belgium to maintain her  independence.It was suggested that these securities might, in a measure, be provided  by     (1) freeing the navigation of the Scheldt, so that  ships of war  could go up to         Antwerp ;    (2) the League of Nations ; and    (3) arranging some kind of union  or federation with  Luxemburg, provided that.         policy were agreeable to the inhabitants  of the Duchy.
     Suggestion of Brussels for Peace Conference. The Secretary of State for Foreign.-Affairs informed Sir F. villiers on October 29th that the Belgian Minister had urgedthat Brussels should be chosen as the place at which the Peace Conference should beheld.  He submitted this partly on the ground that there would he a dramatic  and,as it were, ethical  propriety  in  bringing the  war  to its final close  in  the country which, had suffered first and most from Herman ambitions, and further  that  it  wouldbe taken as a high  compliment by the Belgian people.                                    BRAZIL.     Liquidation  of Enemy  Interests. The  reply of  the   Brazilian government regarding  the liquidation of  enemy interests  (vide Report No. 91)  stated  that  the brazilian Government had dealt wdth the  matter of liquidation as far as was possible under Brazilian  law, and that  it was only practicable to take over those enemybusinesses which had parent  houses in German;/.   It was further pointed  out  thatnotice of liquidation had  already been served on German banks in June last.     After  discussion between representatives of Great  Britain, France, Italy and.  theUnited States, Mr. Barclay reported  on November 3rd that a joint Memorandum  hadbeen presented to the Brazilian Government in which it was observed  that the reply was  based on a total misconception of the Memorandum, of October 23rd.   JdratMemorandum  contained   no  suggestion  that the Brazilian Government shouldconfiscate the property of the  enemy, but  that enemy banks, &amp;c, should be liquidatedand  replaced by Brazilian or Allied  organisations.  ddre suggestion was  made inorder to  render it possible for the Associated  Governments to withdraw their blacklists for  Brazil,  and thus enable their subjects to resume trade  without  violatingthe law against trading with the enemy.  In putting forward their plan for liquidatingenemy banks, the Associated  Governments intended, it  is  pointed out, that Brazilseconomic interests  should not suffer, and for  this reason financial co-operation wassuggested,   ddre announcement  that  the Brazilian Government had taken steps to liquidate these German banks-in June is, it is observed, conveyed  to the associated governments for the first  time, and particulars  are asked for together with informationas to similar steps that are being taken regarding other enemy interests.    In reply, the Brazilian Government calls attention to the fact that  Brazil entered the war  of its own free  will  at a time when Russian and Italian difficulties raised aquestion  as to Allied success.  The Government, it  is- stated, decided on June 7th, onits own initiative, to liquidate those  concerns which had headquarters in Germany.On that day  the Minister for Foreign Affairs declared that in accordance  wdth  theliberal  principles   of - Brazilian law the Government  would  see  that  enemy property was respected ;  but from the day of entering the war, it is remarked, Brazilprohibited the  trading   of  German  commercial  firms  and  instructed  steamshipcompanies to refuse them space in their ships ; arranged  that the Customs authoritiesshould detain goods imported  on  neutral vessels, and. after cancelling  contractsbetween  Germans and public authorities ultimately gave German  banks  six months to complete  their  liquidation.   It  is  asserted  that the  Brazilian Government  willcontinue  the  policy thus adopted of its own free will without claiming compensation.                                     CHINA.     Duties  as  Co-belligerent. Sir  J.  Jordan  reported  on  October  30th that onseeking  an interview with the  President  in  accordance with the  decision of  theAllied representatives (vide Report No.  92),  the  Foreign  Minister asked  that  the interview might be put off for about 10 days, and gave an assurance that satisfactionwould be accorded within that time as to the matters brought  forward.  It has beendecided to grant the request, and meantime the  Foreign Minister  is being  suppliedwdth a copy of the aide-memoire which was presented to the President.     His  Majesty&apos;s Government has approved the action taken on the  above lines, butinstructs Sir J. Jordan that if within 10 days the Chinese Government  has not taken steps to intern enemy civilians and  given further adequate proof of its intention, tocomply with  the points in the aide-memoire an interview with the President should be insisted upon.     Interned Situation. Sir J. Jordan has informed His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthe Chinese Government asked, on October 2-lth for the release of a sum from Customsfunds, but in view of the  likelihood  of  renewed hostilities between North and  South,
the British and  United Slates  representatives agreed  that the request could not begranted,  and  in  this the French Minister  concurred.   The Allied representativessubsequently decided to notify the Chinese Government  that money  would not be released till the cessation of armed conflict between North and South.    Sir -J.  Jordan pointed out  on October 31st that the proposal  that the AlliedGovernments should not extend further loans to China  until the parties had  agreed to suspend hostilities was the natural outcome of the decision to retain Customs revenueuntil the differences between North, and South were adjusted, as  it would obviously be useless to withhold the money if Japan or another country were to  grant a  loan to china.  He observed that the  withholding of money is the only method of  terminating the internal dissensions.    Sir 0. Greene reported on November 2nd that Baron Hayashi, before his return toPeking, had expressed the view that it wotdd be very difficult to get North and Southto agree, and that it might be  essential to apply pressure  when  other  courses had proved abortive.  The North,  he  thought, might  be influenced through Tuan, and theSouth by the British refusal of salt  release.  He said it was important to show that neither side was being favoured.                                   FRANC P.     Relations with Daly. Lord Derby telegraphed on  October 31st some extracts from an important article  in Huinanite by M. Marcel. Sembat, the  Socialist Deputy,upon the relations between France and Italy.   In this the writer begs the Giovernmentto profit by the presence of  Messieurs Orlando and  Sonnino to work together on  thetask of  highest importance, viz., intimate and cordial friendship which should closelyunite France and Italy, and which nothing  should disturb at present or in the future.He states that the censorship would not allow him to  indicate why the matter  is a subject  for preoccupation, and he observes  that no moment has  been more  favourable for settling  the  matter.  He  pays generous tribute  to the  Italian  effort  in the  war,and declare  that numbers of Italians who are  devoted to France are now pained  thatthere should be the least cause of dissension between the two countries.   He  observesthat Italians, like the French  themselves, are  highly susceptible, and that they  wouldbe  cruelly wounded by any too Brusque treatment.  Anythiug which caused them tothink that they are not  esteemed  at their  proper value, that they are being put  intothe background, or that sufficient account is not paid to their great sacrifices, enragesthem.   They expect that Italy shall not be reduced to a secondary role,  but shall fillin the world the place to which  her generous  efforts entitle her.  He  concludes by stating  that  if,  unfortunately, France  neglected to take advantage of the presentmoment, consequences for both countries might be most  regrettable.                                     ITALY.    Italian Credits and  British Trade.  Sir R.  Rodd telegraphed on October 31stthat in regard to  the  increase of Italian  credits,  attention should be jDaid  to theposition of British trade with Italy.  He pointed  out  that the  need of economisingforeign trade was being put forward as a reason for limiting  imports, and  this wouldhave a bail effect upon the trade of the  United Kingdom and Dominions.  Sir R. Roddtherefore  submitted that  the. question of  an increase of Italian  credits  shoidd be dependant upon -satisfactory safeguards being given regarding British imports into italy.                                    JAPAN.    Policy in Siberia. -Mr. Alston telegraphed on October 31st that as  the Japaneserefused to permit any extension of their operations west of Lake Beikal  it was reason-able to ask, as the Russians were doing, why Japan had sent as -many as 60,000 mentIt was understood, he says, from the Japanese declaration made at the commencemen.
ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    Internal Conditions. Lord Acton reported  on October 31 st that the Presidentof the Jugo-Slavs&apos; Club in the Reichsrath arrived  from Vienna on October 28th and,according to information which he  gave, it appeared that  authority in Vienna had ceased to exist, but that the Emperor&apos;s democratic customs  had tended  to  maintainsome  of his popularity.  The whole question for the inhabitants of Vienna restedupon the  matter  of food.  The Socialist leaders had  been able to keep the working-classes in hand up to then, but the lack of  food  might  bring  about  a popular risingat any time.  There was stated to be  little probability of a revolution  amongst the austro-Germans, and they appeared  to be willing to leave their political  status to thePeace Congress.  The threat of joining the  German  Empire was considered to  bomerely made to enable them to  secure good terms from the  Entente.   Latterly theGerman-Austrians in Bohemia had evinced a -desire  to  join -with the Czechs.  It isstated from another source that the union of Bavaria and Baden with German-Austriais being- considered in Vienna, and that the Emperor  is in  constant communicationwith  high  Catholic  dignitaries  in  Bavaria.  The  food difficulties in Vienna are confirmed from other sources, and Lord kilmarnock reported on November 4th that people were in fear of  the returning  soldiers,  and  in various towns  German and austrian  local committees were  being raised for  purposes of  defence,  and trencheswrere being  dug for protective purposes.    As to the position in Hungary, German Wireless of November 3rd reported that-Count Karolyi had been placed  at  the head of the Government.  The HungarianNational Council issued  the following  proclamation to  the people :  &quot; The people of hungary, its soldiers, its workmen and  its  citizens have taken authority in  Hungaryinto their hands.   The people have  set themselves in  motion, and  that is the greatresult  of  this movement.  The  governing political powers in Hungary have given    0817-n                             Bthat the intervention arose from  the wish of the United  States to afford relief  to tlveCzecho-Slovaks.   Complaint is now made  by the  Russians that the  presence  of theJapanese is  not to help the badly armed Czechs,  but to occupy the  country with anarmy  five times  larger than  the circumstances warrant, and  to prevent a  strongcentral Government being established.   Mr. Alston quotes examples of the unsatis-factory treatment of  the native population by the Japanese,   lie points out that upto the present no excuse has  been forthcoming for holding up General Knox&apos;s train,and he observes that the British Military Mission has frequently to  call attention tothe fact that the Japanese Military Mission, while  ostensibly agreeing to the decisionsof the Inter-Allied Military Command, puts obstacles in the way of the action of theBritish Mission,   lie adds that the general attitude of mistrust has been accentuated by the immoderate criticism of the British in the Japanese Press.  Mr.  Alston reportsa conversation which  he  had some weeks ago with Mr. Masudaira, when  variouscomplaints  relating  to  the Japanese troops were put  before him.   Mr. Masudairaaccepted the assurance that, matters were put frankly before him in order  to promoteharmony amon gst the Allies in  Siberia, and promised to try and remove all subjects of misunderstanding,  lie stated that there had been great: improvement between therelations of  the United States and Japanese troops.                               UNITED STATES.    Parties in Congress. Mr. Barclay reported  on November 3rd that in relation tothe elections the Republican, attitude was as strong  in relation to the  war as  theDemocrats- their criticism being as regards alleged  lack of energy in administration.There has been of late, however, Mr. Barclay says, some difference between the partiesregarding peace  questions, and  if a Republican  Senate were elected, the Presidentmight have some difficulties.  Both parties are pledged to the energetic  prosecution of the war.  The new Congress cannot meet before March next.     Cables  to the Press indicate that the latest election returns give the Republicansa majority of 16 in the House of Representatives, while in the Senate the Republicanshave  elected 47 members and the  Democrats 46.   The  elections in  Michigan, Idaho,and New Mexico are still undecided.
Gover political and military authority to the Hungarian people organised in a HungarianNational Council.  The whole civil and military authority ol: Hungary is in the handsof the President of the National Council.     &quot; Tho President of the  Hungarian People&apos;s Government, Count Michael Karolyi,and tho Hungarian National Council congratulate the people  of Hungary upon  thisvictory, and the  Hungarian Democracy requests  the  people  in the sacred name of universal peace to return to  their work.   The great strike has attained its purpose ina very short  time.  Soldiers, return  to your barracks, and await there the orders ofthe Hungarian  Peopled Government, which&apos;wdll  bring you justice  and peace.   Leteveryone refrain from disturbing the peace,   ddre National  Council expects that thejxx)]ile of Hungary will show dignity and tranquillity.&quot;     Lord Acton  reported from  Berne on October 31st that.  Bolshevism   was  veryrampant in Hungary, and that it was improbable that  Count Karolyi would be in theposition to control the course of events in the revolutionary movement  for  which hehad  been responsible.  It was  considered  probable that  Hungary would  grant theright of self-determination to the Croatians provided-that she were  allowed a port outhe Adriatic.  Mr. Olive reported on November 5th from  Stockholm that a personalfriend of Karolyi hail made a statement  to the effect that there was a  real necessity to take steps in order to prevent a general outbreak of Bolshevism  in  Hungary, andit was suggested that as a  method of precaution  from 20,000  to 30,000 English orFrench troops would be sufficient.     Count Karolyi and Germany. In addressing  the Foreign  Affairs  Committee  ofthe Hungarian  Delegation  on October  15th the Pester Lloyd  reports that CountKarolyi made some interesting references to Germany and  the future of  Hungary.He said : &apos;; As Germany&apos;s policy arrayed, the whole world against her, Hungary shouldhave declared her loyalty, but have drawn fixed limits beyond  which she  would not go.  The King  wished to  do this, but incompetent  diplomats hindered him.  ddiegreat mistake was of  thinking that Hungary  could  only attain her  aims  throughGermany.  The idea  of Mittel-Europa was a contradiction of Wilsords plan of a leagueof European States,  and united the whole world  against Germany.  So long as this idea ruled in Germany and  Hungary the  Salzburg Conference showed that, it  stillruled peace was only possible  after a  signal  victory.   Perhaps  an even  worsemistake was the unrestricted submarine war, which  brought America  in and sealedHungary&apos;s fate.&quot;     Count  Karolyi  continued  that he expected,  that  this would be the last of the delegations.  They had not  kept pace with the pacifist idea.  czernin had talked like a pacifist, but his actions at Brest-]atovsk belied his words.  They were annexationistsin victory, pacifists in defeat.  The Delegations were dead ; their continuance a danger to Hungary.  At the Beace Conference there must be the direct representative of anindependent Hungary.  All  joint institutions must be abolished.     Constitution of Jugo-Slav Government: Seizure of  Fleet. Sir R. Eodd reported on November 1st that intercepted wireless messages from  Pola disclosed that Koch,.who stated  he  was  Chief  of  National  Defence,  ami  speaking for the ProvisionalGovernment of Jugo-Slavs,  announced the constitution of the Jugo-Slav Governmenton October 28th.  At  about  the same time the President of the  United States  was informed by the  same officer (acting with the President of the National Council atZagabria and the Local Committee at Pola) that in co-operation wdth the Czecho-Slovak, Polish and Italian sections of the Pola inhabitants, the Committee of Jugo-Slavs seized the fleet and fortress on October 30th, and that they regarded themselves as brothers in arms in the  fight  for justice aud liberty on the principles enunciatedby Mr. Wilson.   They stated they would be glad  of  the early despatch of  naval aid from the United States or a  country not interested in local affairs.     Jugo-Slavs  and the Fleet. Sir  11.  Rodd reported  on November  2nd  that  a wireless message from Pola to the  Entente bowers  had been sent to the  effect thatthe wdiole fleet of the former Austrio-Hungarian Monarchy had, on October 31st, beenconsigned  on behalf of the Slovine-Croat  and Serbian State  to the National Jugo-Slav Government.  The message  begged the Entente, &quot; our liberator,  to regard ournation as a grateful  and sincere friend,  and to cause  these deplorable  hostilities to cease.&quot;  Another message was  addressed to the American  fleet, and had reference tothe Committee of Organisation for Dalmatia having taken over the Government of&quot;Dalmatia by order of the National Council at A gram.     An intercepted Wireless message from Pola contains a farewell  message to thefleet  from  the  Hungarian   Admiral Horthy  transferring the command  to JankoYukovitch who  had  been  appointed his successor by the Jugo-Slav Committee.  In.
the course of this message he said  that any who  wished to  slay  in  the  Jugo-SlavNavy, of whatever nationality, would he welcome.    Lord Derby  reported  on  November 1st that  the Temps had  published  adeclaration by Mr. Trnnvitch in which he stated :     &quot; My countrymen constitute  the great  majority oC the  crews of  the  Austro-Hungarian Navy. 1  They have consciousness of their  nationality and  have been organised for a  long time.   The revolt at Cattaro on February 1st last is proof ofthis.  The Jugo-Slavs took  possession, as will be remembered, of this important naval base.   You can  imagine the effect produced by present circumstances on  Jugo-Slavcrews.   Austro-Hungarian authorities inust have seen  that they could not  any longermake themselves  obeyed, and those officers who are not  Slavs were forced  in general to leave their posts.   Austria-Hungary  in  fact  no longer  had  her fleet  at  herdisposal.&quot;    National Council at Zar/abria. Sir R. Rodd reported on  November nth that  a message had  been sent from  the National Council at  Zagabria to the Italian Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, dated  November 2nd, to  the effect that  the National Council ofthe indivisible nation of Slovenes, Croats and Serbians  inhabiting ex-Austro-llungarianterritory declared themselves an Independent State in a manifesto dated October 29th,and thus broke  off all  connection  with  the Austro-Hungarian  monarchy and  theHapsburg dynasty.  The Croat  Parliament unanimously adhered to this declaration intheir session of October 29th, at which the Central Committee of the National  council for all the Southern Slav Provinces of the ex-Austro-llungarian monarchy was present.The National Council  at the same time informed the Allied  Governments and  theSouthern Slav Committee in Switzerland that the State of Southern Slavs  was readytoform a common State of Serbia and Montenegro comprising the whole ethnographicterritory of the three races.                                  GERMANY.    Question of  Kaiser a Abdication. Lord Acton reported on November 2nd that information had reached the Swiss Government to the effect that about the middle ofOctober the German Government decided  in favour of  the abdication of the Kaiserwith a  view  to bringing about an  early peace.  Herr Delbruck, Chief of the CivilCabinet, was deputed to convey this view to the Kaiser, who expressed his willingness to abdicate on condition that the Crown went to a member of his family,  ddie reason why action was not  taken in accordance with this arrangement was  that  it was not felt j)possible  to agree upon the KaiseFs successor, and it was  considered inadvisable to announce the abdication before a successor  had been  agreed upon.   Owing to  thefact  that in  Berlin and  other  industrial  towns  Workmeids  Councils  had beenformed  in anticipation of a  general  break-up, it was considered that the EmperoFsabdication  would  involve  the  outbreak  of a  revolution.   On November  5thLord  Acton  reported  that  reliable information   had  reached  him  to   the  effectthat the immediate  abdication of  the Kaiser was  considered  less  probable thanit was  a week before.   While a majority took the Anew  of Payer  and the NationalLiberals that, the  abdication would assist revolutionary efforts, a great many consideredthat Germany would get better  peace terms if the Kaiser abdicated.   It is said thatthe Socialist Democrats  and some members of the  Centre Party  were  against  theKaiseFs immediate abdication.    Sir W. Townley reported on November 2nd that  the Kaiser had  decided not toabdicate.  Other  sources  of  information  show  that  the position of the Kaiser hadbeen somewhat improved and the party led by Herr Erzberger opposed his abdicationon the ground that England would prefer the maintenance of the monarchy.    Sir W. Townley, in a telegram dated November 6th, states that  the following  is asummary of  the  situation in  Germany as regards  the  abdication of the GermanEmperor as explained, to the Austrian Charge d&apos;Alfaires by the  German Minister:     On the  demand of the Social  Democratic Party, represented  by  Scheidemann,that the Emperor should abdicate in his own name and that of his son in favour ofhis grandson, a  Cabinet Council  was called and with two  dissentient  votes  theabdication was approved, but the question of regency was not decided. Here there were three  alternatives : (.1) Prince  Henry of Prussia ; (2) Prince  Max  of  Baden ; (3)  a council  of Regency.  The latter  solution found  most  favour,  but it was decided,before  proceeding further, to  sound the  Emperor.   He  replied that  he was quite prepared to abdicate if such a  step was considered desirable in the interests of  thenation, but that  he could not answer for his  son.  whom  he offered to consult at ArmyHeadquarters.  The Crown Prince  at  once  refused  categorically  to  surrender  his
Srights to the throne unless obliged to do so by force.  The Emperor then returned to berlin  and issued a manifesto, countersigned by Prince Max of Baden, in which heset forth all the constitutional changes that have been made to meet; the wishes of thepeople.   (See under &quot; Constitutional  Reforms.&quot;)  There the matter  stands, although.the Social Democrats are still pressing for abdication.    Internal Conditions.-Sir W. Townley reported on November  1st that lie  had obtained information from Mr. Diaz, who had just returned from Berlin, to  the effectthat deep depression was reigning in Germany,  and that the  people were  willing toaccept such conditions as the Entente  might impose.   The  informant stated  thatLiebknecht was speaking openly in favour of civil, war to large audiences, and he hadnot been interfered with.    The Berliner Tageblalt, under the title of &quot;-Imported Bolshevism,&quot;  announcesthat notices have been addressed  to  the  Berlin population, especially to soldiers, inthe form of handbills signed &quot; \Vorkmcn&apos;s and Soldiers&apos;  Council.&quot;  The source of thehandbills is not known, but the object is  to provoke tho  soldiers  to  mutiny  againstmilitary orders, and in this way render the Imperial authority powerless.  Tdie writerin the paper observes that &quot; it is  impossible to  think under present  conditions  thatsocial   democracy  is  responsible.   Obviously they must lie  work of   dangerousidealists who have allowed their  heads to be turned by  happenings  in Russia.  Itis not necessary to point to results of Bolshevism  in  Russian Empire to see  whatharm  it  has  worked.&quot;  The writer proceeds to deal wdth the constitutional position,remarking that in the heaviest military crisis the  German  Empire  has  succeeded inproclaiming new constitutional principles which are to secure the  co-operation of thepeople in Government and in decisions concerning war and  peace.   The BerlinerTageblalt also states  that hand in hand  wdth the attempt to  introduce Bolshevismruns another  agitation wdiich obviously proceeds from the Pan-Germans. Pamphlets,it is stated, have been  distributed in  Greater Berlin wdth the call &quot;German men!German women !   Come on Sunday next at .12 o&apos;clock to  the  Bismarck Memorial ! &quot;It is agreed  that these  leaflets are connected with the  new  attempt to  arrange  a demonstration.    Constitutional Reforms. The NorddeutscTie Allgemeine  Zeitung,  according to german Wireless of November 2nd, had an article upon Constitutional Reforms inwdiich Lord Robert Cecils recent speech  -was dealt with,   in the course of  this it was stated : &quot; By  the  new Constitutional  Law, a fundamental change  has been  broughtabout, in all this wdiich is the fulcrum by means of  which all other conditions in theEmpire can automatically be influenced by the Reichstag.  By the same ConstitutionalLaw the position of the Bundesrat in the Imperial body has undergone an extraordinarychange.   If, by reason of the change,  the  conditions of power as between  the crown and Parliament have been pushed in one direction in favour of the people&apos;s represenla-tion, and if, from this change in the Empire, as has been  shown during the  past fewrAveeks, all the isolated States without exception have gone in for a similar  parliamen-tarisation  of  their Governments, and  also for the diminishing of  the power of the throne, this  shows that even the  Bundesrat no  longer has its former influence and its former extent of power.&quot;    A Berlin official telegram of November 2nd states  that on the occasion of the changes in the German Constitution coming into force  the Kaiser addressed  a decreeto the Imperial Chancellor in the  course of which  occurred  the  following passage :&quot;Prepared for by a  series  of  Government Acts, a  new order now comes  into  force which transfers  the fundamental  rights  of  the KaiseFs person to the people.  Thuscomes  to a close a period vdiich wdll stand in honour before the eyes of future genera^Hons.&quot;   ....  &quot; I endorse these decisions of Parliament in the firm determination,so far as I am concerned, to co-operate in their  full development, convinced that I amthereby promoting the wTeal  of the German people,  ddie KaiseFs  office is one ofservice to the people.&quot;NEUTRAL GROUP.                                  DENMARK.    Schleswig Question. The Danish Minister  has assured the Foreign Office thatthere have not  been any negotiations between the German and Danish Governmentsregarding the Schleswdg question, and that  the German  statement that  Denmark
had approached Germany on  the subject  is quite without foundation.   Referring tothe Resolution passed  by the Rigsdag (vide Report No. 92), the Minister  stated&apos;thatDenmark  wished ^ to have  that portion  of Schleswig which was inhabited by peoplespeaking the Danish tongue.    Lord kilmarnock has informed  His Majesty&apos;s Government that Germany hasprotested  to the Danish Government  regarding  the agitation on  the  subject ofSchleswig, and has alleged  that the discussion  of  the matter at this stage conveys anunjustified suggestion of the weakness of Germany.    A sat stance for  Esthonians  and  Lithuanians. -Lord  kilmarnock informed HisMajesty&apos;s Government on November 3rd that the  Danish Minister for Foreign affairs had intimated that  it was  nor practicable lor Denmark to assist the Esthonians andLithuanians  with troops to protect them from Bolshevist clangers when the Germanswithdrew, as the Army was solely constituted for home defence.  The  Minister statedhis belief  that the Swedish and  Norwegian  Governments  were  unwilling to take any action, though Norway might apparently  permit  private  people to sell arms to theEsthonians.                                   FINLAND.     British Policy. His Majesty&apos;s Government called the attention of Mr. Olive to a recent interview  given by Lord  Robert Cecil to  the Foreign  correspondent of theJlufbud sbladel, when it was stated that on the assumption that the majority of people in Finland  desired the independence  of  the country,  Finland  should  become anindependent State when a government  of  stability had  been brought into existence.The reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government had refused recognition in J anuary was dueto the fact  that there  was no government in Russia to deal with, and no political stability in Finland.   Mr. Clive has been informed that it is clearly impossible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to recognise  Finnish independence  until  all  notion  aboutelecting  a German Briiice is abandoned and the German troops are  sent out of thecountry.     Attitude of Government. Mr. Clive  reported  from Stockholm on .October 31stthat he had  been informed that- there was no doubt the Finnish Government would bereconstructed after the meeting of  the  Diet on November 5th.   In  Mr. Clive&apos;s view,reconstruction  woidd only eliminate  certain  pro-German people.  He observes thatRepublicans will  only enter a coalition government  if there are new elections.   Thiswould  mean the establishment  of  a Republic, as the Diet would probably only  return25 per cent,  of  Monarchists.  The present Diet consists  of 200 members, of whom 64are Monarchists.     Mr.  Clive also learns that,  there  was  considerable apprehension  as  to the bolshevists  attacking Finland from  Betrograd, where  a large  Bolshevist army Avasunderstood  to be ready. ;  AVhile hesitating to seek Allied help, it was stated that theFinnish Government would be glad to learn that, if the Germans had left the country,Finland  might rely on Allied co-operation  from Murmansk in order to meet anyattack.                                   MEXICO.    Position of Cabrera. Mr. Thurstan reported on November 1st that he consideredCabrera the most able  of  those following Carranza, and though  his attitude was not certain he was at any rate in strong opposition to Carranza&apos;s Chief of Cabinet, the pro-German  Berlanga.   Though Cabrera  is anti-American  and perhaps  anti-British,Mr. Thurstan thinks he might be influenced by the assurance that  Mexico&apos;s  interestsdo not lie  in obtaining the friendship of Germany, who is the enemy of  the greatneighbouring Republic, but in promoting  good feeling with Great Britain,  who isthe greatest  friend  of the Hnited States and in a position  to influence  Americanpolicy.    0817-ib                             o
                                  NORWAY.    Internal Situation. Mr.  Ovey  reported  on November dth  that  the  ForeignMinister had referred in conversation to the danger arising from the internal situation,though he again gave utterance to his satisfaction at die unsuccessful efforts of theSocialists at the elections.    Assistance for Lithuanians,  &amp;6. Regarding the possibility of Norwegian help for the Lithuanians, &amp;c. (see under &quot; Denmark &quot;),  the Foreign Minister has intimatedto Mr. Ovey that he will discuss matters with the other Scandinavian Governments andthat if Denmark and Sweden were willing to act, Norway would probably follow suit.It appears that the Minister did not refer to the matter of supplying ammunition, butonly to the question of sending troops.  Mr. Ovey expresses the view that, the  questionof assistance rests mainly with the Swedish Government.  (See under &quot; Sweden.&quot;)                                    SPAIN.    Seizure of German Ships. The Secretary of  State for Foreign Affairs informed sir A. Hardinge on October 2Sth that the Spanish Ambassador had intimated that hisGovernment had been told by the French Government that the German ships recentlyseized  would  be  regarded  as enemy vessels  and that the  transfer  would not berecognised.  The attitude of the British Foreign Office was conveyed  to  the Am-ambassador to the effect that if there was  any ground for thinking  the transfer wasmade to avoid capture, it could not be regarded as  valid.  In reply to  questionswhether anything was to be paid for the ships and whether they were to be ^transferredto the Germans at the  end of  the  war, the Ambassador  gave somewhat hesitatingdenials.    Sir A. Hardinge was informed on November 1st that the Admiralty had arranged that  if  the German  ships which had been taken over by Spain were seen outside territorial waters they would be seized on the ground that there had been  no recognitionof the  transfer.   Sir  A. Hardinge was instructed  to acquaint  the Government wdththis, stating that His Majesty&apos;s Government reserved  their right to refuse recognition.On November 2nd Sir A. Hardinge  reported an interview with the Foreign Minister,.who  stated that no payment had been.made to  Germany for the vessels and  that  theships might be claimed by the  Allies as part of their war indemnity.     Views of King  on German  Affairs. Sir A. Hardinge  informed His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on November 5th as to the views of.the King of Spain on Europeanaffairs, recently expressed in a  conversation. ^ The King stated  he was in favour of&quot;the capitulation of Germany and the abdication of the Kaiser in both German andgeneral interests.   He, however, was against the  termination of Imperial authority,which he considered  should be made elective.   He believed  that Austria should  be-                               NETHERLANDS.    Internal  Conditions. Sir  W.  Townley  reported on  November  2nd that  theinternal conditions  of  the  country  were giving rise to  considerable  apprehension.There  have been  mutinies in military  camps  and  much  distress exists amongstcivilians owing  to  lack of  food.  Bolshevists  are  said to be increasing in numbers and-the hungry state of the population is helping their propaganda.    German Vessels  at  Antwerp. The  Dutch  Minister  of Foreign Affairs   hasassured the Belgian Minister  that ships at Antwerp  trying to descend the  Scheldtmust  either  refrain from  entering Dutch waters  or  be sequestrated  if they  do.Nineteen German and Austrian ships have already been sequestrated.    German Destroyers in  Ghent-Tcrnenzen  Canal. ddie Netherlands Governmenthave been warned that they will be  held  responsible if the four German destroyers,which  aerial reconnaissance  has shown  to be in the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal, escapeinto the Scheldt.
occupied by French and British, but not Italian, Serbian or American  troops, on  theground  that  the  last-named  were distasteful  to the Austrians while the first-namedwere popular.                                   SWEDEN.    K.ing&apos;s Speech In Riksdag. The King&apos;s Speech in  opening the Riksdag special session on October 30th contained references to the high prices of food and  the need of necessaries, which rendered it essential for the Government to take action in orderto alleviate the distress.   The Speech  also referred to the necessity of introducingrestrictions on employing capital, and modifications in giving the credits which wereinsisted on by some countries trading with Sweden.    Assistance for Fsthouians, etc. The Foreign Minister  informed  Mr. Clive onNovember 3rd that the Government  was still considering the matter of assistance in meeting the Bolshevist menace (-see  also  under &quot; Denmark &quot; and &quot;Norway&quot;).   TheMinister, however, expressed  a  serious doubt  as to whether the Government wouldconsent to send troops, as  this necessitated the approval of the Swedish  Parliament,but  he  did  not see objection  to allowing  volunteers  to go.   As to arms andammunition,  the Minister pointed out that Sweden  was  herself short of these.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.       (N.B. Countries are arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)General.    1. President Wilsotfs Note to the German Government. On November 6th BresidentWilson forwarded through Switzerland a  Note to the German Government  on thesubject of peace.  This Note followed the  communication to President Yvdlson of theAllied decisions reached  at a  series  of meetings of the Supreme War  council at versailles which was in daily session  from November 1st to November 5th.  At theirsession on November  5th the Supreme War council finally approved  the armistice terms  to  be  OFFERED to Germany in the event of properly accredited  representativesof the  German Government being sent to Marshal Fcch.  Admiral Sir Eosslyn Wemyssis to be associated with Marshal Foch to represent the Allies in regard to the Navalaspects of the. armistice.   The German representatives reached the  Allied front at noon on November 7th.    2. Fate of the German, Colonies. In a telegram  from the Prime Minister to theWar Cabinet, forwarded by Lord  Derby under his No. 136S, dated  November 2nd,the former stated  that  he had made it clear to Colonel House, in discussions he  had had wdth him, that the British Government had no intention of restoring any colonies to Germany at the end of  the  Avar, nor of taking away any ex-German colonies fromBritish Dominions Avho had captured them.    3. Freedom of the Seas. The following is a paraphrase of observations communi-cated by Colonel House to a meeting of Prime Ministers in Paris on November 3rd : &quot; President  Wilson&quot;  stated  that  he recognised  freely  and  sympathetically  the necessities of the British in regard to the freedom of the seas. He realised that  thisis a question upon which there  should  be  the very freest discussion and exchange of views; the  president, however, was not sure that the Allies had definitely acceptedthe principle, and that they are only  reserving the limitations and free discussions ofthe subject.  The question of. the  freedom  of the seas need not be discussed with theGerman Government  provided the Allies Avere agreed among themselves beforehand.President Wilson  took the  view  that freedom of the seas  was one of  the questionswhich had  been altered by developments  in  this war, and that in any case  the law governing it would! have to be amended.&quot;  In answer to Colonel House&apos;s statement thePrime Minister said it would  be impossible  for him,  or for  any  British  Prime
Minister, to commit himself to the principle of the freedom of the seas, but the PrimeMinister sent  an undertaking  to Colonel  House  that we were  prepared  to  make adeclaration that we were  willing to discuss the question of  the  freedom of the seaswith the Entente Governments in the light of  the, new  conditions which had arisenduring the course of the present Avar.     Albania. Lord Acton reports in a telegram, 2071, the receipt of a memorandumregarding live future of Albania from M. Adamidi in which the latter considers thatit is a political necessity that all purely Albanian districts should be united togetherunder a single administration.  M. Adamidi states that there are now few Glermanophilsleft  in Albania, and that enthusiasm  for America  and Italy is running high,  ddieAlbanian people had  always had a special devotion to Great Britain, and imploredGreat Britain to exert  her influence with Serbia and  Greece  in order to induce themto agree to Albania forming herself into a small independent State.     Austria-Hungary. The Austro-Hungarian  military representatives signed thearmistice presented to them by General Diaz  on behalf of the Allies on November 3rd,and the armistice took effect from 3 o&apos;clock on November 4th.   As the terms of thearmistice were  published by  the   Prime Minister  in  his  speech  in  the House ofCommons on  November 5th,  it is not proposed to reprint, them in this Deport.     ddie recent  meetings of  the  Supreme  War  Council  at Versailles  INTA-e  beenattended by M. Benesch, the  representative of the Czecho-Slovaks.     Count de Salis in his telegram 74, dated  November 2nd, reports that the CardinalSecretary of  Stale informed him that a former  Bapal Nuncio  at  Vienna was stillinclined to  think that the threatened disruption  of the Austro-llungarian  Empirewould not be  complete ; however, the Cardinal Secretary of State was not prepared to endorse  this  opinion, though he still thought that some sort  of union amongst the peoples  would be  best for  them and for civilisation.  In  his opinion it would  bedifficult for the several nationalities in question to maintain themseh-es  as  entirely separate States, and he took  the view that Germany would be  the ruler of  all, OAvingto their weakness as separate units.     Sir W. Townley reports in his telegram 3870, dated November 3rd, that accordingto a Berlin  telegram of November 1st, it is officially announced that the  german submarine boats lying in Austro-Hungarian ports will not be affected by the Austrianarmistice.     Bulgaria. Lord Acton  reports in his telegram 20S7, dated November 2nd, thatthe  Serbian and  Rumanian Ministers are still  apprehensive lest the Entente shouldfavour territorial pretensions  of Bulgaria at the expense of Rumania and Serbia.     France. ddie attitude  of  the French Press consists in  the main of a warning tothe French Republic against  the belief that  the war against Germany is over.  TheTJomine Libre maintains that  the Allies must still remain on their guard  against anenemy7 who  still  has hopes that he will  cause their courage  and unity of  purpose toslacken by peace talk.     Germany. An interesting Arersion of the attitude of A-various sections in Germanytowards peace questions in  general  and the position  of  the Raiser  in  particular;,Avas given in telegram 2010  from Lord Acton.  His  informant is a  certain  HerrGiittmann, who is connected Avith the Frankfurter Zeibuug.   Guttmann declares thatone of  the  outstanding facts  of the past  year is the growth of the  Emperor&apos;sunpopularity.  He has hardly a friend in his  own country.   The Reichstag Majorityhad always  suspected  him.  But on  Hertling&apos;s accession  a reception  was  given inorder to bring him into personal contact with  the parry leaders.  His  behaviour gavegreat offence.   He Avas arrogant and bombastic, with a tendency to ill-timed jests.     After the success of the &quot;March offensive  he became especially sarcastic at theexpense of the Reichstag.  He referred to it  as a collection of ill-dressed oddities andhe made fun of the personal peculiarities of its leading members.  Erzberger wasespecially infuriated at being  called the &quot;postman&quot;  with  reference to his  father&apos;shumble employment.     ddie Reichstag was incensed at the manner of Hintze&apos;s  appointment  as  foreign secretary, which AAras deliberately intended to affront them.  They have not the leastbelief in the  genuineness of the emperor&apos;s  conversion to belief  in  parliamentarymethods of government, and  they would  only be  too pleased to get rid  of  him
 altogether if they could do so  without  bloodshed.  On the other hand, the military party and the Pan-Germaiis are even more angry with him for yielding as much as he has to the Reichstag.   On 1 Iertling&apos;s fall they had expected a &quot;strong&quot; Chancellor, if not a military dictator, and they regard Prince Max as dangerously advanced.     Ludendorff and  the  saner  elements of the party agreed to accept the situation, and  to endeavour  to recapture the  Emperor&apos;s vagrant favour.   But the extremer section of the  party went much further.  Bed by men like Tirpitz, who have fallen from power, they began indulging in secret conciliabules shrouded  in mystery, whose object is  believed  to have been to discuss the possibility of  forcing the Emperor to abdicate.  He  would have been succeeded  by the Crown Prince, who is perfectly willing to play the parr, assigned  to him.  lie would have overthrown the present Government, and started again on strictly militarist lines:     Of course such a movement would  have been bound to fail.  With the mass of the people the  Crown Prince is far more  unpopular even than  his father,  and the end would have been a  revolution  organised by the Socialists or general anarchy.     As regards the Emperor, Guttmann thought that the mass of  the people would welcome his enforced abdication, and that the Pan-Germans would secretly chuckle at it.  They would  consider it  as an  appropriate-punishment for having given in to the Reichstag.     But the Emperor is only a  secondary  matter.  Guttmann says  that the one real concern of his   commercial friends  is the economic  boycott  after the war, and they would do  anything to  lessen their  economic, hardships.   They would even agree to sacrifice Alsace-Lorraine, though they bitterhy resent the loss of the two provinces on economic rather than on sentimental grounds.     Several telegrams  have  been  received  during the  past week  pointing  to  the impossibility of the German attitude having stiffened  in  regard to the conclusion of peace.  It is not clear, however, wdtether this attitude  is  shared by the  German Government or by  any section of German  opinion other than the  extreme militarist faction.  It is  more probable, therefore,  that suggestions  that Germany is adopting a stiller attitude  are being deliberately put about  by the German authorities in order to try and influence certain sections of public opinion in the Entente countries in  the direction of mitigating the harshness of the armistice terms.     Sir W. Townley stated in his telegram of November 6th that the German Minister in explaining the position  in Germany  to the  Austrian  Charge d&apos;Affaires (see  also &quot; Question of EaisePs Abdication &quot; under &quot; Germany &quot;), the  German Minister gave it as his opinion  that  Germany wdll continue to  light rather than accept humiliating terms of peace. This, he  thinks, will not  only be the wdsh of the Government,  but that of the people which would rise  in revolution and sweep away the  Government were it to accept terms disgraceful to Germany&apos;s national honour.   He says Germany does not fear invasion  from the south  as  the configuration  of the country renders defence more or less easy in that direction.     On November  5th the German Government issued the following appeal to the German people : &quot;  The need of the times is a burden  upon the world and  upon the German people.  We must hold out  during  these difficult days and overcome their consequences.   To-day wre must work for happier times, to which the German people have a right.   The  new Government is engaged in carrying out this task.   Important things have already been attained ; equal suffrage in Prussia has been secured ;  a new. Government, has been formed from the representatives of the Majority Parties in the Reichstag.  The Imperial Chancellor and his fellow workers need for the carrying on of their functions the confidence of the Reichstag and thereby of the people.     &quot; Fundamental rights have  been transferred from the person of the Kaiser to the representatives  of the people.  The declaration of war and the  conclusion of peace are subject to the approval of the Reichstag.   The  placing of the military administration under a responsible  Imperial Chancellor has been carried out.   Afar-reaching amnestyhas been proclaimed.  The freedom of the Press aud the right of assembly  have been assured.   Yet much still remains to be done.    &quot; The change of Germany into a People&apos;s State such as shall not  be behind  any state in the world, in political freedom and in care for  the  social welfare, is  being determinedly continued.   The new order can only exercise its liberating and healingeffect if a spirit which realises its liberating and healing effect and furthers its aimsis to be found among the administrative and military authorities.    sir-ib                                &quot;
    &quot; We expect from our fellow citizens who are called upon to serve tlie community in official capacities that they will  co-operate with us willingly.   In all parts of theState  and  Empire  we need  the maintenance of public  safety  through the people themselves.    &quot; We lnrve confidence in the German  people,  it has behaved splendidly throughlour years of terrible warfare.  It will not, allow itself to be driven by fantasies, in asenseless and useless  way, into fresh  misery and  ruin.  Sell-discipline and order arenecessary.   All lack of  discipline will most  seriously endanger the  conclusion of anearly  peace.  The Government, and  with  it the  Command  of the Army and  Navy,wish for peace.  They wish  it sincerely, and  they wish  it speedily.   Gnt.il that time we must protect our frontiers from the breaking in of the enemy.  The  troops whichhave  been  standing for weeks lighting  severely must  be  given  a rest  by beingrelieved.   Only for this purpose, and for  no other reason, has the calling up of menbeen recently proceeded  with.    &quot; Our special  thanks  are due to the men of the  Army and of the Navy, andlikewise to their leaders.   By their  contempt for death and their manly disciplinethey have saved their Fatherland.    &quot; To  our  most  important tasks belongs the reconstruction of  our economicconditions, so that the soldiers and sailors on returning to their homes from the frontmay find the possibility of being able again to secure a livelihood  for themselves andfor their families.    &quot; All large employers of labour  have declared themselves ready to take on againtheir  former employees  and workmen who are now in the  field,  ddie  providing ofwork, the  support of those out  of  employment, the housing problem, and  other measures in this domain are partly carried through and partly in preparation.    &quot; With the conclusion of peace an improvement in the food supply  wdll soon bepossible, as also in other conditions of life.    &quot; German men and women ! War and Peace are our common tasks.  The Stateand Empire are our common future.   Your confidence, which is essential for us inthe hour  of danger, is  in  truth nothing more than the confidence of  the  Germanpeople  in  itself and  in  its  future,   ddie  assured future of Germany is  our guiding-star.&quot;    The appeal is signed by Prince Max of Baden ;  Vice-Chancellor von Payer ; theVibe-President of  the Prussian State Ministry, Dr. Friedberg, and all the secretaries of State.    Tjilliiidnia and White  Russia.- Lord Kilmarnock reports in his telegram 325S,dated November 4th, that a  delegation from the Rada of White Russia established atMinsk have requested the following message to be delivered to Mr. Lloyd George :      &quot; On the approaching retreat of  the German troops  from the occupied territoryaccording  to paragraph 0 of the conditions  fixed by President  Wilson, our countryembracing White Russia and Lithuania, wdiich over three  years was theatre of war,.will again be exposed to atrocious deeds.   Bolshevist gangs await the moment whencountry wdll be cleared of regular troops to overrun it and sacrifice  it to murdering,robbing and destroying our  property and civilisation.  Through  its Rada  (national council), in wdiich all parties and sections of population are represented, the country-has proclaimed its independence, which is, however, denied acknowledgment  by theRussian Bolshevist Government and prevented  by force.   We, therefore requestEntente as the champion of the small nations of liberty and for reasons of humanenessto protect  the country from threatening anarchy  and furnish it before  retreat ofGerman troops wdth some military force to prevent murders, incendiarism and pogroms.&quot;    In  connection with the above the Russian Ambassador at Washington approachedour representative on November 4th, asking  him to call the  attention of the BritishGovernment to the serious condition that would arise if German troops are withdrawnfrom Russia, and the population left to the mercy of the  Red  Guards.  He suggestedthat the opening up of the Black Sea  might enable the Allies to send troops for police-purposes to prevent this happening.  He Avas much exercised  at the threat gWen outby the Bolshevists of a Avholesale massacre of  the bourgeoisie  and intellectual classesannounced to take place on November 10th. He thought that the annihilation of these classes  Avas probably part of  a German plan to reduce the population of Russia to  amass of illiterate peasants without any aptitude for organisation or industry, therebygiving Germany an open field for unrestricted deArelopmeut  in the economic sphere inthe country.
    Portugal. The Portuguese Minister in Paris attended a meeting of the supreme war Council on November 2nd, when armistice terms with Germany were discussed.    Serbia and Jugo-Slavia. Lord Acton, in his telegram 208G, dated November 2nd,reports the substance of an interview that he had had on November 2nd with the newSerbian Minister, M. Jovanovitch, who is a nephew of  the Serbian Prime Minister,M.  Pas itch. M.  Yovanovitch stated that  it was  quite decided that Croatia andSlovenia would be united with Serbia and Montenegro into a single Empire under thepresent  Serbian dynasty.  The idea of federalisation had been dropped lin favour ofa unitary  state.  He stated that all parties  had  agreed upon  this, including  theinhabitants  of  Montenegro.   This would involve the disappearance of the Monte-negrin dynasty.  He  added  that there was a danger of some friction between thenew Jugo-Slav Government and the Italian  Government  over the question of Goriziaand especially  Fiume.
