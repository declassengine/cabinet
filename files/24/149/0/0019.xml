SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT  No. 94.PART II. FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.                          PEACE DISCUSSIONS (page 10).    The armistice terms granted to An stria-If angary and to Germany are given in an appendix.   Arrangements for the conference to decide  upon the terms of peace arenot yet complete.  The collapse in all enemy countries of the authorities responsiblefor the  war policy  may  lead to difficulties in  the  provision of properly accreditedrepresentatives of enemy nations to take part  in peace discussions.   Food, for thetime, has taken the  place of war material as the decisive factor in influencing theworld-situation.                                    G ENERAL.    General. The  ideals  of  force  and  terrorism, unrestricted by  justice  or  moral obligation, have been supported  by the  two great  world-forces of &quot; Kaiserism &quot; and&quot; Bolshevism.&quot; Kaiserism has been discredited by the defeat of its armies. Bolshevismremains, with headquarters in  Russia, and during  the  next  few weeks much  will depend  upon the  attitude of the still mobilised German Army.

TheKaiseFs abdication  was  insisted  upon by  the  Socialist parties, who, for the time,appear to wdeld the  power over what was the German &quot;Empire.&quot;   The effect of the
return  to  Germany  of  a  still  mobilised  army  will  be  awaited with  interest.Immediately after the dismissal of. M. Joffe for engaging in Bolshevist propaganda, heis reported to have returned  to Berlin at the  invitation of the present Government.Bolshevism spread rapidly in  Russia when the army had been  demobilised,  but inGermany the army is still a force to be reckoned  with  in internal, if not in external,affairs.

PART  II.-FOREIGN  AND GENERAL.GENERAL.    Transfer of  Enema Shipping  to Neutrals. A  circular telegram lias been  sent from the Foreign Office to  the  Ministers accredited to neutral Governments to theeffect that the Allies have a claim against the shipping of the Central Powers in viewof the hitters&apos;  illegal submarine campaign.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government thereforedecline to recognise any transfer of enemy tonnage  to neutral ownership  before thefinal  conclusion  of  peace,  except  with   their special  consent.  (Vide  reports nos. 92 and 93.)    Prisoners  of  War. in   a   telegram  from  the Hague  of  November  10th,Sir W. Townley alluded to the difficulty of coping with the large number of british prisoners expected to arrive from Germany.  He has appointed His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Rotterdam and Colonel  Oppenheim, the Military Attache, to form a specialCommittee to deal with  the situation,  and  has asked for the prompt  supphy from england of food and clothing, and, if possible, of additional shipping for  transport.    Lord Kilmaruock (Copenhagen) is also making arrangements for the provision offood and transport.    Serbian Relief.-The Foreign  Office has asked the French Government to concur in a scheme  for  the  relief of  the Serbian  people.  Proposals  are  made for (1) an inter-Allied  commission;  (2)  the   co-ordination  of existing relief organisations;(3) financial arrangements with such bodies  as the Inter-Allied Food  Council.ALLIED  GROUP.                                  BELGIUM.    International  Status. Following  upon the interview between Baron Moncheurand the Secretary of State for Foreign  Affairs on October 25th (vide Report No. 93),Lord Robert Cecil  has informed  the  Belgian Minister that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis entirely agreed that Belgium should  enter the Society  of Nations after the Avar asan ecptal and entitled to the same protection as granted by the peace settlement to allfree  nations.   On September  30th M. Pichon addressed a  note  to the  BelgianMinister at Paris declaring  that the  French  Government considered the  belgian governments desire  for complete sovereignty as  opposed to obligatory neutralitylegitimate.    Suggested Union  with Luxemburg. On October 26th Baron Monchetir handed a communication to the British Government in Avhich is described the encroachment  ofGermany on the independence of the Duchy since its separation from Belgium in 1839.The Belgian Government considers it vital to BelgiunPs interests that the violation ofLuxemburg&apos;s neutrality by Germany should be  punished, and that  the status quo antehelium should not be  re-established.   It urges that a solution is to be found in thefree reunion between Belgium and the Grand Duchy.                                    BRAZIL.     Liquidation of Enemy Interests. Sir Arthur Peel reported on November 8th thepublication of a decree, dated October 16th, which allowed German banks six months from that date in AAdiich to liquidate.  No mention ivas made of Cierman firms.  (VideReports Nos. 91 and 93.)
oin                                         CHINA.jgk       Dulles as Co-belligerent. Sir J. Jordan has  been asked to make strong rejire-     sentations with regard to the liquidation  oil the German Hank and  the  unrestricted     activities of the German Medical College at Woosuug.         Internal  Situation. Referring  to  Baron  Hayaslb\s  conversation  with Sir  C.     Greene  (vide Report No. 93), Sir J. Jordan states that Baron Hayashi  intended to     refer to  the release of the Customs  Surplus Revenue and  not to the release of Salt     Revenue,  which was appropriated   by  the South early  in the  present year.  He     considers that Baron Hayashi  evidently had in mind the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s     Gonsul-General  at Canton  that pressure might  be  brought to bear ou the South     through Hong Kong in order to prevent the seizure of the Customs Surplus Revenue.         Sir J. Jordan learns that Japanese Banks have  received instructions from their     Government  to  stop  further  advances on loans  already  contracted. The  Chinese     Government has only sufficient funds for the upkeep of the army during  the  next six     months, and it may find itself, in consequence of Japanese action, in a serious situation     unless terms of iieace are arranged between North and South.         Baron Hayashi  in a conversation with Sir J. Jordan said he  thought the  Nordi     genuinely desired to come to terms  with  the South.                                   FRANCE.    Russia, and  the Opening of the  Dardanelles.   Verite and  M. Longuebs  organPopidaire protest against the statements made in several  papers  to the effect that freeaccess to the  Black Sea  will  enable  action  to  he  taken against  the Bolshevists.Popidaire says that if, after the Avar with Turkey,  Bulgaria, Austria  and Germany  is over,  the French or Allied Governments intend to  begin  it afresh against Russia, theFrench Socialist Party and  working classes will  refuse to support them  in  such apolicy.    Lord Derby reports  that  the  Administrative Council of the Socialist Party hasA-voted a  resolution on the occasion of the first  anniversary of the Soviet Republicprotesting against the Allied  expedition to Russia.    Demonstration in the  Senate. After  a  great  patriotic demonstration in theFrench Senate following upon M. Pichoibs announcement that German parlemeutairesAvere  on  their way to Marshal  Foch and  Admiral Wemyss, the Senate unanimouslypassed the following Bill:     (1)  ddie Armies and  their leaders, the Government  of the Republic,  citizen           Georges Clemenceau, President of the  Council and Minister for War, and           Marshal Foch, Generalissimo of  the Allied Armies, have  deserved  Avell  of           their country.    (2)  ddie text of  this law  will be engraved so  as  to  remain permanently in all           Mairies and schools of the Republic.    ddie Bill Avas adopted  in the Chamber  of  Deputies  by 421 votes to one.   About GO Socialists abstained from voting.    Socialists and Peace. Lord Derby telegraphs on November 9th that the  French Socialist Parliamentary Group unanimously passed  resolutions  for (1) the raising  of,the state of siege directly the armistice is concluded  and  an immediate return to normal  public  life;  (2)  extensive amnesty  measures  in  connection with  offences arising  from strikes  and the enforcement  of  military  discipline;  (3) progressive demobilisation ;  (4) the  representation of Labour delegates at  the Peace  Conference and the  formation of a concurrent International Labour and Socialist Conference.     On  November&apos; 10th the Socialist Federation of the Seine acclaimed the reA-olutions which, following the example of the Russian Revolution, are overthrowing thrones and bourgeois privileges in Central Europe.     Liebknecht and Adler Avere elected honorary  Presidents of  the  meeting, and the end of the Avar of capitalist classes  was hailed.
4o    The oflicial Socialist newspaper  IFumanite contained an article  on November12th, stating that in the interest of Europe the German Republic must  be allowed  to live in liberty.    M. Albert Thomas concludes an article entitled &quot; Democracy or  Bolshevism&apos;&apos;  asfollows : &quot; Either  Wilson  or  Lenin,  either  democracy,  borne  of  the  French   0Revolution,  justified  by the struggles of  an entire  century, defined by the GreatRepublic of the United States, or else  primitive, incoherent, brutal forms of Russianfanaticism.  We must choose.&quot;                                   GREECE.     Departure of British  Garrison from  Corfu. Lord  Granville reports that the departure of the British garrison from Corfu is generally regretted.  He learns froma local source that our prestige may suffer in consequence of the withdrawal.                                    ITALY.    Italian landing at Pola and on the Dalmatian Coast. Sir R. Bodd reports thatYice-Admiral  Cagni  entered  Bola on  November 5th,  and  was  welcomed by  thepopulation and the crews of the vessels in the harbour.   On the other hand, a message from Admiral Koch, commanding the Jugo-Slav navy, has been intercepted, in whichhe protests to president Wilson and the Allied  Governments against the landing,which took place in spite of the calm prevailing in the city, and the Italian demandfor the surrender of the Jugo-Slav fleet and arsenal.  These measures, he declared,were inconsistent with their position of an Allied nation.    The provisional Government for  Dalmatia  and Spalatro have addressed a similarprotest to the Italian Minister  of Foreign Affairs against the Italian landings at Zaraand on the islands,  which are declared a violation -of the integrity and rights of  the jugo-Slav State.    Feeding of Prisoners. Sir  R.  Rodd telegraphed on November  7th  that  theItalian Minister of  War estimates that  the  number  of Austrian prisoners in Italianhands exceeds  700,000, in addition to which 300,000 Italian prisoners are returning from Austria.   The problem of feeding  an additional million men is a difficult one,and  it is therefore  considered  essential that  there  should  be  no stoppage  in  theimportation of frozen meat supplies.    The  Pope on the Italian Victory. Count de Salis gives the  gist of a letter fromthe Pope published  on November 10th.   The Pope protests against the efforts op hisenemies to excite public opinion against him by casting doubts on his patriotism.  Herefers to  his Note of August 1st, 1917, in which he lays down that territorial questionsbetween Austria and Italy should be solved in conformity with the just aspirations ofthe populations concerned.  He  announces that he has instructed the Papal Nuncio atVienna to open friendly negotiations  with the  different  nationalities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire which have now become independent.                                 PORTUGAL.    The Anstro-PLungarian Armistice. The Portuguese Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs asked Sir L. Carnegie to transmit to the King and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthe congratulations of the President and Portuguese on the signature of  the armisticewdth Austria-Hungary.                               UNITED&apos;STATES.    Flections  in  Congress. Mr. Barclay  telegraphs  on  November   7th  that  a republican majority .of at least 25 in the House of Representatives is certain, and of
one or two in the  Semite is  probable.  An article on November Sth from  a limescorrespondent considers the likelihood of  a  rapprochement  between the Republicansand  Democrats and draws attention  to a Democratic  tendency in the East and a republican tendency in the West.  Socialism has received a  rebuff.    Mr. Ifooixr. Air. Hoover has been requested by  the  PRESIDENT to go  to  europe in order to take charge of  the reorganisation of food  relief for Liberated Prance amiBelgium, and  for Rumania, Serbia ami the liberated populations of Austria.ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.     Internal Conditions. The Commander of the Army of  the Tyrol has  requested the Entente through the Swiss Government to occupy the Tyrol as quickly as possible and to take steps to provide for the subsistence of the civil population and the Army.The National  Council of the Tyrol explains that this  will be the  only  means  of preventing  famine.   Meanwhile the Army is unable to evacuate the  South Tyrolowing to  lack of  supplies  in the North.  Sir  11. Rumbold suggests that such an occupation might  act as  a check on a union  between  the  Tyrol  and  Bavaria.  Amember of the Tyrolese delegation at Berne states that the  population would preferintervention by British or American troops.  Many Tyrolese  hoped  to see a  federationwdth  Germany; others  advocated  union  wdth  Switzerland.  There  was  a  general feeling against South  Tyrol being ceded to Italy.     The situation  with regard to sending food  into the Tyrol has been  complicated by the Bavarian invasion, but on  November 4th the Swiss Legation reported  that orders had been given for the withdrawal of Bavarian troops.     ddie  Foreign  Office  learns that the  City of Vienna only possesses food stockssufficient  to last until November 15th, and that other parts of  the country are  in asimilar plight.   Prince  Schomburg and  Prince  Wmdisehgratz  (see  below)  give information to the same effect.  The Mayor of Vienna has asked neutral representatives to beg the Allied  Governments to send food, with which request, Mr. Clive  reports,they have complied.     The- Foreign Office learns that the United States Charge cV Affaires at Copenhagenhas  telegraphed to his Government  that  internal tranquillity and the suppression of bolshevism  depend on the solution of the food question.   A Czecho-Slav delegateinformed  the  United States  Minister  at  Berne  that,  if   the  Vienna  Governmentcontinued to draw food  from Bohemia, the latter would  be  reduced to famine.   Thiswould pave the way for Bolshevism.     Future of the Dual Monarchy. The  Vienna correspondent of  the  NorddeulscheAllaemeine Zeituncj states that in Vienna there  is a general opinion that the Ententewdll attempt to maintain  some form of union under the Hapsburgs between the Austro-Hungarian  States.  A similar view has  been expressed  by  certain  Austrians  in conversation wdth Sir  Id.  Rumbold at Berne. They try to  explain that some such policyis necessary in order  to  (1.) prevent a union between German Austria and  Germany;(2) withstand the encroachments of Bolshevism ;  (3) establish a central control betweenthe  newly formed  States  wdiich are by nature mutually dependent.  The following isthe gist of these conversations :      On   November 7th  Prince  Windischgratz,  recently  the  Food Controller  in hungary, read a paper to Sir H. Rumbold  in which he stated that  the Emperor  heldneither to his crown nor  to his dynasty, but wished to establish harmony between theindependent States wdiich  were about  to be  created.  He considered that it wasimpossible for the newly created States of the Dual Monarchy, which were economicallyindependent,  to  cut  themselves  adrift  from  one another,  ddie Germans desired by every  means possible  to obtain  a union between German Austria and Germany.Sir  11. Rumbold  considers  that  the Emperor  is  relying on Great  Britain,  andpossibly France, to maintain him as the sovereign  of a loose  confederation of States.     GS17 B
    In an interview on the same day Count Mensdorlf stated that the representationof the National Council of  (ierman Austria and of the Czecho-Slovaks at the ForeignOflice indicated the need  felt for some central authority,  lie was convinced that ifGerman Austria failed to reach a  modus vivendi with the Czecho-Slovaks and  other states she would gravitate towards Germany.    Both Count Mensdorlf and Prince Windischgratz considered that the EmperoFsmanifesto to nationalities was the final cause of the Austrian debacle.  On November8th Sir IP Rumbold reported that the Papal Agent  at Berne told Lord  Acton that itwas essential that Great Britain should take  steps  to maintain  the  Emperor on  the throne.   Unless some element of stability remained, it would  be impossible to prevent a wave of Bolshevism spreading through Austria to Italy.  He advocated the despatchof British or American troops, not only to the Tyrol, but to Lower and Upper Austria,in-order to  ensure the maintenance of order.  Tins, he asserted, was the desire of tirepoptilation.    On November 9th Prince Schomburg, the Austrian Ambassador to the Vatican,saw Lord Acton,  lie said  that Great Britain, who herself had dynastic interests at stake, should immediately proclaim her intention of keeping the  Emperor on  the throne.   Sir 11. Bumbold notes the anxiety shown by the Vatican  to  save the Austro-Hungarian  throne.  He submits that there can be  no  advantage in  receiving furthercommunications from Austrian and Hungarian emissaries,  since the wishes of iheStares of the Dual Monarchy arc still  unknown.  Discussion  should  be kept for thePeace Conference.   In this view the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs concurs.    Formation  of  Governments. M.  Barezy,  late  Chef  de  Cabinet  to  CountEsterhazy,  told Sir 11. Rumbold in an interview on November 8til that a constituentassembly, elected by universal suffrage, woidd meet in the near future to decide upontin.&apos; form of the  new  rate of Hungary.  The returning troops and the middle and lower classes of the population were in favour of a Republic. He  thought Count Karolyicould count upon the  support of the greater part of the country  and touched upon the probability of some  confederation of States.   Sir 11.  Runibold reports  that at  aconference  held at Geneva a joint Jugo-Slav Government was elected consisting ofthree  Serbians and three Austria-Hungarian Jugo-Slavs.   It is  learned  from anothersource that Bosnian delegates are in communication with the Serbian Government.                                  GERMANY.    Apart  from-the armistice,  referred to under  &quot;Peace Discussions&quot;  and in dieAppendix to  this  Report, the points  of greatest, interest at the present moment arethe form of government, and amount of control it is in a position to exercise over the(late ?) German  Empire, and over the several States.   The position alters daily.   Atthe present stage  the following  extracts from information sent by diplomatic repre-sentatives in various countries  may  be of  interest, for  comparison with  informationpublished in the Press.   The Political Intelligence Department has brought out  animportant paper,  dated November 8th (G.T. G265)  on  the internal  conditions inGermany.    On November  bth Sir VP. Townley quoted demands in the Bavarian Press for theabdication  of the Kaiser.   Lord Acton (Berne), on the same date, reported on reliableauthority that the Kings of Bavaria  and Wiirtemberg had met on November 1st atEegensburg to discuss, it was believed, the abdication of the Kaiser.    On November  Qth Lord  Acton reported on tentative proposals by the Governmentto keep the Kaiser on  the  throne to avoid danger of Bolshevism  and preserve the moral of the army. Sir W.  Towniey called attention to an article in the Norddeuiselieby Prince bulow, opposing the abdication of the Kaiser,  in the interests of the peopleof Germany, and,  on  the  same  clay,  to an appeal  in  the same  paper, signed  by theImperial Chancellor and the State Secretaries, to the German people to support, them.    On November 7th Sir W. Townley reported a Reichstag debate during wdiich theSocial  Democrats  demanded the KaiseFs abdication.   The &quot; progressive  people&apos;party&quot;  in  Wiirtemberg had expressed adherence  to  the idea  of  a United  german empire.                        . .    On November Sth the report of  Prince Max of Baderds  resignation  as ImperialChancellor was received from Sir W.  Townley at 8.o5 p.m.   Sir .11.  Rumbold and SirW. Townley reported the proclamation at Munich of a  Bavarian Republic.  A council
of workmen, soldiers, and peasants was formed  under the presidency of an  Inde-pendent  Socialist,  Kurt  Eisner,   This  council put  forward  an appeal  for  theimmediate election  of a constituent assembly to found a  Democratic and SocialistRepublic &quot;before the enemy bursts over  the  frontier and  before  the  demobilised.German Army returns from the front and introduces disorder everywhere.&quot;  Riots inHamburg and Kiel  were reported by Sir \V. Townley,  and n revolution was expected in Berlin:  Labourers&apos; councils were formed in Hamburg, where tramway  and  over-head traffic was at, a  standstill.   Red Hags hoisted on all men-of-war at Cuxhavon andRensberg.   Revolutionary movements  were  reported  later by  Sir  \V. Townley on good authority, and Soviets were said to be in control  at, Lubeck, Bremen, and  I lam-burg.  In the remainder of  Germany, with the exception of  Bavaria,  as reportedabove, there was quiet,  ddie  Imperial Chancellor published a  proclamation  in  theTageblatt appealing  to the people to  maintain  order.   Sir II. Rumbold  reported on good Swiss authority the triumph of the Civil Government  in  Berlin over the  partyrepresenting the Military Authorities.    On November 9th Lord  Kilmarnock  (Copenhagen&apos;) and Mr.  Ovey (Christiania)furnished precis  of  local announcements  of  reports, obviously  of Germau origin, ofthe fraternisation between the crews  of British and German  war vessels, and  thehoisting of the red flag.   Various strikes  affecting railway traffic in Germany were reported  by  Lord Kihnarnook.  Sir \Y. Townley reported the abdication of the Kaiserand  the  appointment of Ebert  (Socialist) as  Imperial Chancellor.   Cologne andFrankfurt in the hands of revolutionaries.    On November 10th the arrival of  the Kaiser  by special  train at  Eysden  was reported by  Mr. Maxse (Rotterdam).  Count de  Sabs (Vatican) reported deterioration of the discipline of the German Army on the Eastern fronts.  Sir W. Townley reported a  difficulty  in obtaining  information  about the  KaiseFs companions.   The  crown prince was not believed to be amongst  them.    On November 1 11.11. Mr. Clive (Stockholm)  forwarded a Bolshevist announcement.that M. doffe, the Bolshevist  envoy who recently left Berlin, had been invited by thenew Chancellor to return.    On November 12th further reports were received  of revolutionary movements inGermany.   Hindenburg  was  reported  to have  telegraphed  placing himself  and  theArmy at  the disposal of the new Government &quot; to avoid chaos.&quot;    German Wireless, between the same dates, gives some interesting indications ofthe  control  over  the  Berlin  wireless  station  for  dissemination  of  news.  (hiNovember Qfli  the honour of the German nation is defended, and the National Govern-ment  discussed wdth approval.  Attempts are made to  make out that German civilianprisoners have suffered  from ill-treatment at our hands.   A proclamation on  behalfof 850,000 Germans in Posen, protesting against being joined to Poland,  is publishedfrom  the vorwarts.   On November   7th,  a message  from &quot;Chief Engineer MateBeyer,&quot; ou  behalf  of  &quot; The  Trustees,&quot; is  sent  to the Third Srptadron  of the Fleet.A definite  accusation is made on  the same date against M. Joffe for  carrying on an agitation against German State institutions, and  the German working classes  are saidto decline Bolshevism.  The  departure of  the  Bolshevist &quot; embassy &quot; from Berlin isreported, also the publication of a paper called The Reel Soldier, on Bolshevist  lines,wdiich  has  been  circulated in the Eastern Army.   On November Sth- the economic position of Alsace-Lorraine is taken up, and attempts made to prove that transfer toFrance would ruin  those provinces.   A   claim is made &quot;from a  reliable  source&quot;that the disorders at, Kiel and other ports have  ceased, and &quot; the  military protectionof the Baltic  by the  Navy  has  been re-established (sic).&quot;   It is claimed  that theFederal States. are  introducing  constitutional  reforms  on a  large  scale.  Saxony,\\dirtemberg, Brunswick, Hesseii, and the Thuringian.  States are mentioned.   PrinceMax,  as  Imperial Chancellor, issued by wireless a manifesto to the German people living abroad :     &quot; The victory for  which many of  us hoped lias  not become ours, but a greater         victory has been won by the German people, as it has conquered itself  and         its belief in the light of might.&quot;    On the same day an appeal -was issued, signed von  Mann, Secretary of State to theImperial Navy Office, through all naval service  stations calling the Soldiers&apos; Councilsrepresentatives of a usurped authority, &quot;not recognised by the Imperial Government,&quot;but sanctioning the formation of confidential commissions elected by the  crews  of thedifferent  naval detachments on land and sea, and relaxing the regulations  for salutesin naval  stations.  This was  followed  on  the same day by the  announcement  oL the resignation of Prince Max as  Imperial Chancellor.
s    According to the latest Press reports, the newest Glerman Government containsno Chancellor, and  is  constituted as follows: Herr Ebcrt  (interior  and MilitaryAffairs), Herr Haase (Foreign Affairs),  Herr Scheidemann  (Finance  and  Colonies),Herr  Dittmaun (Demobilisation,  Transport;  Justice, and  Health), Herr Lands berg(Publicity, Art, aud  Literature), Herr Barth (Social Policy).   Fbert, Scheidemann,and  Landsberg belonged to the party that  supported the war ; Haase, Dittmann, andBarth were anti-war and anti-militarist.  M.  Jolfe, the Bolshevist &quot;ambassador,&quot; was reported in The Times of November 13th to have returned to Berlin.     On  November   11th  the  Political  Intelligence  Department  brought   out  amemorandum (G.T. 02(34) on the Social Democratic parties and riders in Germany.Ebert is described as a  very able  political organiser.  A good authority considers thatthe Minority  Socialists led by Haase and Ledebour possess the confidence of  the bulkof the working classes.NEUTRAL GROUP.                                     CHILE.    German Ships. Sir  E. Stronge  reported  on November  7th  that, the  ChilianGovernment had caused the occupation of German ships and was holding them at thedisposal of the Allies pending  peace negotiations.  Four of these  vessels have beenrequisitioned.    Nitrate. The Allies are negotiating  the  purchase of a  considerable quantity ofnitrate.                                  DENMARK.     The German Frontier. The  Minister  of Defence announced  to  the  Press that steps were being taken  to  strengthen  the  frontier guards in view of the unsettledstate obtaining in  Schleswig.   The available troops  in Jutland are  being used  forthis purpose.  It is stated on reliable information that  the Chief of the General staff has given out that Danish troops are prepared  to cross the frontier if the protectionof the Danish population in North Schleswig necessitates such a course.  No troops are to be sent from Copenhagen for fear of the  existence of Syndicalists  amongstthem.     Bolshevism. Lord  kilmarnock  has  asked  the  Danish Government to take measures against Bolshevist agitators.  Care  must  be  taken,  however,  to avoidalienating the  sympathies  of the Socialists, the  bulk of  whom are  opposed to  the bolshevists.  A Syndicalist meeting held on November 11th passed off quietly.   the danish Government is considering  the advisability of recalling the Danish minister from Petrograd.                                   FINLAND.    Bolshevism. Mr. Clive learns that the situation in Finland is critical.   RussianBolshevist  troops are collecting  on the frontier and Bolshevism is spreading in theFinnish &quot;White Army.   Apart,  from the  policy of Allied military intervention in finland and Russia, Mr. Clive&apos;s informant considers it essential to send  supplies to finland if Bolshevism is to be prevented.  He suggests that Finland might be consti-tuted  a bulwark  against  the  encroachment  of Bolshevism  if a  strong policy of intervention were adopted.
                                NETHERLANDS..     Internal Gondition.-.The Socialist leader, Troelstra, has attacked the Queen and the Prince of the Netherlands in the Chamber.  Sir W. Townley learns that Troelstra, who is in daily communication with Scheidemann, is determined to bring  about  the establishment of  a  Socialist  Republic.   Troelstra  considers  that  the future  of  the world is in  the hands of the Germans, who are alone competent to  reorganise society on Socialistic  lines.  Peace conditions  must  be left to an  International Socialist Conference  which will prevent the destruction of Germany.     It is reported that a considerable  sum  of  money has been received by extreme-Socialists for the purpose  of  starting  a  revolution.  Lack of  food  adds  to  the discontent.   The Amsterdam Exchange is afraid of a  revolution in the near future. The Minister of Foreign Affairs told Sir \Y. Townley that the partial demobilisation of the Army, which commenced on November 11 th, was decided upon owing  to  the fact that the Army was likely to breed Bolshevism.     Sir W.  Townley thinks  that revolution is imminent, and  points to the  danger of Troelstra joining the extremist YVijukoop.  This, he suggests,  might be  avoided if Great Britain made the importation of food  supplies into  Holland dependent upon political stability.  On the other hand, Sir YV. Townley telegraphs more optimistically on November loth.  He reports a statement by Dr. Nolens to  the effect that  85 per cent, of the Army, the entire Christian Labour organisation, and the mass of peasants are opposed to the Socialist movement.   He further considers  that the movement is being fostered by Germany, who sees her best hope for favourable  terms at the Peace Conference  in the socialisation of the world.   Troelstra, he states, has  received funds from Germany.     The Government  has issued a Proclamation stating that arrangements  are being- made for the supply of food and other necessaries ami calling  upon the  people to. maintain order.     Socialists criticise severely the Queeids greeting to the German  Emperor  on his arrival.                                   NORWAY.     Elections. Mr. Ovey reports  that the result  of the first series of two  ballots for those parliamentary candidates  who  failed to get absolute majority at the first elections was announced  on November  5th.   Out of 13 constituencies  the Conser- vatives gained five more seats, and the Socialists one.  The Conservative Party now holds  35 seats, the Liberals 21, and the Socialists  14.  The Labour  Democrats hold one.   Fifty-five constituencies remain to  be balloted for.     Bolshevism. On November 10th,  Mr.  Ovey submitted a scheme as  a basis  for future Norwegian and neutral action with  regard to the Bolshevists.  He considers that neutral Governments should, break off  diplomatic relations with  the  Bolshevists. They  would thus be  in  a  position to expel Bolshevists from  their countries, and control their propaganda.   Banks should  be compelled  to  refuse  financial  aid to Bolshevist organisations.  &apos; He suggests that pressure should be brought  to bear to force  neutrals to co-operate in anti-Bolshevist measures.                               SAN  SALVADOR.     Union  of San  Salvador and Honduras. Sir A. Young learns  that  the  twoRepublics have approached the United States with a view to negotiating a treaty fortheir  union under the  President  of  the  Republic of San Salvador.   They offer towithdraw their protest  against the Nicaragua Canal Treaty and to  grant the UnitedStates Government complete control over the Bay of Fonseca in return for guarantees.

Clive reported on November 12th that the wholeDress was violently opposed to the armistice terms, one Liberal paper comparing themto the Brest-Litovsk Treaty.  Air. Branting was  the  only political  leader in Swedenwho acknowledged the  justice of the terms..  Air. Branting has asked  permission toproceed to Holland old England for the purpose  of attending  a meeting which is toprepare the ground for reuniting the International.  Air. Branting considered that thiswould be  the best means for combating the spread of Bolshevism.     interned Condition. Air.  dive reports that a  largo demonstration  took place onNovember 10th which  consisted of some ten thousand persons. A. petition was  laidbefore the Prime Minister demanding vigorous measures for the better supply of FOOT!and  the reduction of the cost of  living.   On Mr. Ovey making enquiries as  to theimportance  of this demonstration the Minister  for Foreign Affairs  stated that thepeople were orderly but that cries of &quot; Long live the Republic&quot; had been raised.  he did not consider that it  had any connection with a Bolshevist manifesto published inthe Politiken, demanding a general strike ami a republican constitution.     Assistance to lite Baltic Provinces. ddie [Minister for Foreign Affairs has informedMr. Olive  that at  a meeting of  a secret committee of die Riksdag it  was decided thatthe consent of the Riksdag  could not be obtained for sending troops to the  baltic provinces.  There were also  several objections  to  sending  arms.    The swedish government would, however, allow reserve  officers and non-commissioned officers to volunteer  as instructors.     Lord  Derby has  stated that the  French Government is opposed  to the despatchof Swedish troops or  arms to the Baltic Provinces.                                SWITZERLAND.    Bolshevism. The  French  Ambassador  told  Sir  .11. Rumbold that  he  hasstrongly represented to the Swiss Government the danger of permitting  Bolshevistactivity and  propaganda, of wdiich  he held  documentary proof.  Sir If. Rumboldreports that  on November  6th  the Federal Council decided to expel all Bolshevistsfrom Switzerland and to  call up a small body of troops to deal wdth any consequenttrouble.  x\s  a result the Committee  of Action of  Socialist  and Workmen Syndicatesproclaimed a  strike in 19 large towns,  ddie President  has threatened to retaliate  bymobilising the  wdiole Army.  Normal conditions, however, prevailed on  November10th, except at  Zurich, where local Socialists demanded the withdrawal of the militaryand  the  recognition   by  the  Federal  Government  of  the  Bolshevist  Alissiouin Berne.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.       (N.B. Countries are arranged m alphabetical order under this heading.)    General. The record of  Peace discussions has now culminated in  the armisticegranted  to  Germany.   The published  terms of  this,  and of the Austro-Hungarianarmistice, are given in an Appendix to this Report.     France. Lord Derby on November Oth reported  the following words  used byM. Clemenceau in connection with the Austrian armistice :      &quot; We have made friends  with our old  enemies the English and we  love themwell.   We see the prodigies wdiich they have accomplished ou our battlefields.&quot;     On November 7th, Lord Derby drew attention to an article by &quot; Pertihax &quot; in theEcho de Paris, in which he observes that the only point of disagreement between Americaand  Allies  is now the question regarding freedom of  seas,  out  of  which  german propaganda has, made so much capital.   He continues as  follows: &quot;Saved by theNaval power of  our British  Allies,  and  by blockade which it has allowed  us toestablish, we cannot give up this  supremely efficacious arm  against  any continentalimperialism. President  Wilson  admits divergence of  opinion,  which  does  not,
however,  prevent, him  from  demanding with  us  the armistice  which  we  wish.&quot;On November llfcli, Lord Derby drew attention to an important, article by  Gauvainin  the  Debuts, pointing  out that military  defeat, and  not. social revolution, wasthe cause  of  peace.  &quot;Socialists have  no right, therefore,  to credit German  social democrats with merit for the cessation of hostilities.&quot;    Germany. On November 11th, Sir  llosslyn Wemyss telegraphed the terms, in french, of the  armistice  signed  at 5  a.m.  with  tire  German  delegates,  andsubsequently added  (hat the  clause dealing  with  submarines had  been  altered  toinclude all such craft.   On  the  same day Lord Derby telegraphed, in  French, the annexes to the  armistice.  The terms, as published  in  English,  are given  as an appendix to this Deport.    The  following  important declaration   by  the German Plenipotentiaries  wasreceived from Lord Derby at  7.10 p.m. on November ].Ith :     &quot;German Government will naturally endeavour with all its strength to take  carethat the duties imposed upon it will be carried out.    &quot; The undersigned  Plenipotentiaries recognise that in  certain points  regardhas been paid to their suggestions.  They can therefore regard the comments madeon  November 0th on the conditions  of the armistice with Germany and  the answerhanded to  them on November 10th as a complementary part of the whole agreement.    &quot; Tluw must, however, allow no doubt to exist on the x^oint that in particular the short time allowed  for evacuation as well as the surrender of indispensable means oftransport  threaten to bring about a state  of things which, without its being  the  faultof the  German Government or the German people may render impossible the furtherfulfilment  of  the conditions.     &quot;The undersigned Plenipotentiaries further regard it as their duty with referenceto their repeated oral and written declarations once more to point out with all possibleemphasis  that the carrying out of this  agreement must throw the German people intoanarchy and  famine.  According  to  the declarations  which preceded the armistice conditions were to be expected which, while completely ensuring the military situation of our  opponents, would have ended the  sufferings of women and children who take no part in the fight.     &quot; The German people which  has held  its own for 50 months against a world ofenemies will, in spite of any force that  may be  brought to bear upon it, preserve its freedom and  unity.     &quot; A people of 70,000,000 suffers but  does not die.              &quot; Signed :  ERZBEUGEU,  OBEIINDOHEF, W INTTEI!FELDT,  and WANSELOW.&quot;     According  to information from the German Press, sent by Sir W. Townley onNovember 7th, either it  was believed, or attempts were  being made  to make thepeople believe, that discussion of the terms would be permitted.     As affecting British prisoners of war, His Majesty&apos;s Government impressed  uponMarshal Foch through olhcial channels on November 7th their anxiety that  alt british prisoners   should  be sent home,  the  armistice overriding  all  existing agreements.Telegrams of  November 1 lib from Mr. Maxse (Rotterdam) aud  Lord Eilmarnock(Copenhagen) show  that immediate arrangements have  been made to deal with thisclause of the armistice.
