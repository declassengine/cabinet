SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERA!                           REPORT  No.  S9.                  PART II. FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.                           PEACE  DISCUSSIONS (page 17).    Information received under this  heading is rapidly increasing  both  in volumeand in importance,   it  has only been  possible to give brief references  to  the  mostimportant matters.     Germany, in connection with peace overtures, is obviously very  anxious  to getthe proletariat of enemy countries to believe that a real democratic control of policy has  been established.  (See also under Germany below.)   I  think  it may now he taken as established that Austria-Hungary must  make  peace at once on. the best terms that can- be obtained, and. that Turkey would  do the same if not prevented by fear of German bayonets and German-manned war vessels.                                GENERAL (page 2).     There  seems to have been no improvement  in  the dastardly cruelty  of the treatment by Germany  of British  prisoners of war behind the lines since the date of the Younger Report, in which details were issued to the British public.                                ALLIED  COUNTRIES.     NOTE. It is observed that President Wilson does not use the expression &quot; Allies &quot; but &quot;Associated &quot; Nations or Powers.     Italy (page -1). There has been a strike of munition workers, synchronised with the  German peace offensive.                                ENEMY  COUNTRIES.     Austria-Hungary (page 5) and Germany (page 7) show a  desire  to  come to the peace table respectively with &quot; federalisatiou &quot;  and &quot; democratisatiou &quot;  as  nominally accomplished.     Germany (page 7). From the  bulk of information received, some of which it has been impossible to include owing to limitations of space, the Military Leaders have not even yet learned their  lesson,  ami still cling to their theory that  force should override all moral obligations in the intercourse between States.  It  is said that  they mean to put the occupied  districts to lire and sword, if  an armistice is refused..  It seems  probable  that Prince Max would  try  to  prevent  such vandalism.   If so, the
conduct of the German armies in their retirement will  afford a barometer of theamount of control exercised by the new &quot;democratic&quot;  Government over german policy.

A Cabinet crisis, nominallyattributed to the pay of  schoolmasters, has occurred, and the Government have taken no action upon their  threat to seize German shipping.

PART  II.- FOREIGN  AND GENERAL.GENERAL.     Sinkings. According  to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the  total tonnageof 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons  gross  in  the case of sailing-ships, reported lost owing to the malice of the Iving&apos;s enemies during the periodSeptember 27th-October 3rd inclusive, was 31,524 tons  gross, of which 28,869 were british, as compared  with 34,540 tons  gross, of  which  21,239 were British, reported last we eh.     Goal. A Report  (G.T. 5866,  dated September  27th)  by the Allied  maritime transport Council, emphasises  the  immense importance to the entire Allied  supply position of an increase in the production of British coal,  ddre suggested importationof coal  from America is deprecated,  &quot;due conveyance of  5,000 tons of coal  from america involves the  shutting out of 5,000 tons of other stores and (supply tonnagebeing the limiting factor to the American military programme) this involves the lossof 1,000 American- soldiers in France.  As against this, 5,000 tons of coal can beproduced in a year  by 20 men.&quot;   The Ministry  of Shipping  reports (G.T. 5898,dated October 7th) :   &quot; There  is no sign whatever  of  any improvement  in  coalavailable for export which was looked for from the campaign for an increased  output.Early in  September  a slight improvement was  indicated, but for the week ended september 21st there &quot;was  a drop in the total  export,  and the quantity exported forthe week  ending 28th was  below that  for the previous week.  This  was  no doubtentirely  due  to  the  railway  strike in South Wales,  which it is estimated  lost100,000  tons  of  coal  to the country,   ddre total amount available  for shipment, ascompared with the  total minimum  amount required for  shipment, showrs a deficit ofabout 22 per cent.  The Italian programme has been met, but the French programmecontinues to accumulate arrears ....  and many  of the  French ports could deal with more colliers.....&quot;    Inter-Departmental Prisoners of War Committee. The War Cabinet has decidedthat&apos; a Minister of Cabinet rank  shall be. appointed  as  Chairman  of the Inter-Departmental Prisoners of  War  Committee, which  will  be  responsible   for  all questions affecting  prisoners of  war in enemy  countries.   At the request  of theWar Cabinet, Sir George  Cave has consented to  act  as Chairman  of  the  above committee.     The Anglo-German  Prisoners   Agreement --The  contentions  of  the GermanGovernment in regard to the Anglo-German Prisoners Agreement are the subject ofcriticisms published in  The Times  of  October  4th  and  5th.   The netherlands government  reports that the German  Government denies having accepted  duringthe negotiations the proposal to exclude submarine crews from  repatriation.   Withregard to  Germans in China, the German Government  suggests  that  Idis Majesty&apos;sGovernment should permit them to return  home under  the same conditions asGermans in British overseas territory, and should not take part in any measures forthe internment or  deportation of such Germans as may remain in the power of theChinese Government.     Ill-Treatment of British Prisoners. ddre Foreign  Office learns  that there are5,000 British prisoners  in the Charleville district who are  in  a most deplorablecondition.  Assistance in the way of food and clothing is  being organised  by theCom he National and the Red Cross  Depot  at Rotterdam, and the good offices of theNetherlands Government have been  invoked.    British Prisoners of War  in Bulgaria. Dord Derby reports  that the  FrenchGovernment  has  instructed  General d&apos;Esperey  to expedite the release of  british prisoners of war in Bulgaria,  (Sec Report No. 88.)
    Exchange of British and Turkish Prisoners. The Foreign Office is insisting thatScala  Nova should he adopted as the port both for disembarkation of Turkish andembarkation of British prisoners of  war.   The  Ottoman  Government has proposedNovember 16th as the date for  the  exchange.   The Foreign Office has designated a vessel for the purpose and furnished the German, Austro-IIungarian, and  OttomanGovernments  with particulars of its markings.  Objection has been taken to  thestipulation  by the German Government that she should  be  sold  to  the netherlands government.   (See Reports Nos. 86 and 88.)    Dropping of. Pamphlets by. Airmen. The Foreign Office  has  reminded  theGerman  Government that  the  dropping  of  pamphlets  cannot (as the  GermanGovernment contends) be regarded as contrary to  International .Law.  Moreover,  inspite of the allegation of the German Government that orders forbidding this practicehave  been  issued to German airmen, numerous  inflammatory  leaflets have been dropped  behind the Allied lines.  The German Government is further  reminded thatany ill-treatment of British airmen by reason of their  having  dropped pamphlets on german or  occupied territory, or having been captured wdth  their  machines equipped for this purpose, will be followed by reprisals.   (And see Reports Nos.  54, 58,  59, 61,63 and 66.)    French and Belgian  Declarations regarding German Devastation. French Wire-less of October 5th records a  warning by the French Government to  Germany thatoutrages  against the population, the towns and  the land of France will  not gounpunished.   &quot; The  German people  who  participate  in these orders  will bear  theconsequences.  The authors and the men who give  the orders for these  crimes  will beheld responsible, morally, penally and pecuniarily.....France is even now holding-pourparlers with her Allies as to all the decisions to be taken.&quot;    A declaration advocating the application of lex talionis to material damage hasbeen  addressed to Lord Derby by the  Comite National d&apos;Action pour le Reparationdes dommages causes par la Guerre.    A similar protest by the  Belgian Government  is reported  in  The  Times  ofOctober 9th,  at page 9.    The Foreign Office  learns  that,  apart from the military advantages  of layingwaste French and Belgiap towns and territory before retreat, the  Germans  expect  to gain thereb3:r important economic advantages over France and Belgium in viewr of  thefact that  their own country remains inviolate.ALLIED  GROUP.                                    BRAZIL.    Question of Economic Go-operation with the Allies. Suggestions are on  foot forthe assumption by  the  Allies of the responsibility  for Brazibs  external debt, for financing the Brazilian coffee and rubber crops, and purchasing the Brazilian outputof manganese.  The suspension of the Allied Black List  is also contemplated, as wellas the provision of a small loan for war  purposes.  In return, the Brazilian Govern-ment will be asked to admit, the Allied  Governments  to a  share  in the control and allocation of  Brazilian shipping (including the  11 ex-enemy ships not at present in service) and to  liquidate  German interests in Brazil.   In  this connection steps arebeing taken  towards the formation of  a British financial  group which would inviteAmerican and possibly also French, Italian and Brazilian  co-operation.  Meanwhile,Mr. Hoover  represents  that it is necessary for the United  States Government  topurchase a large quantity of Brazilian  coffee.   The  Foreign  Office instructs Mr.Barclay to urge the desirability of limiting such purchase pending  the settlement of a comprehensive scheme.   (And see Reports Nos.  69, 71, 75, 76,  79, 84-86 and 88.)    Brazilian Courts and Allied Black Dists. It is reported (M.l. 6 B.  733) that  the brazilian Courts refuse to recognise as due to force majeure  the inability of firms  to deliver  goods&apos;  by reason of Black List  prohibitions.  As  a result, old-establishedEnglish houses are liable to be sued for  large damages by Black-listed concerns.
CHINA.     Recognition of the Czechs. Tlie Chinese Government  has formally announced toSir J. Jordan, as doyen of the Allied Ministers, its recognition of the Czech forces as-Allied belligerents and of the Czech National Council  as their authorised representa-tives.   (See also  Reports Nos. 81  [Appreciation] and  82 and  84- under  &quot; Austria-Hungary.&quot;)                                   -   CUBA.     Activities of Enemy Subjects. -Mr. Cowan attributes  various  recent cases ofincendiarism  to sabotage by enemy subjects.   He observes that representations madeto the Cuban  Government on numerous occasions as  to the  necessity  of preventingsuch outrages have been without result, and urges that the Associated governments should now insist on drastic action.  Meanwhile he has again approached the CubanGovernment  and has given instructions to masters  of transports to  take  suitableprecautions.                                     ITALY.     Speech by  Signor Orlando.-Sir  R. Rodd reports  that  the Italian parliament reassembled on October 3rd.   ddie President of the Council read a Declaration by theGovernment.   Referring  to the recent victories, he spoke of the unity of front as areality and not  a  phrase.  The concentration  of the  offensive effort in  France  and flanders in which Italian troops were  also taking part, while Italy  on the right wingheld up the Austrian Army,  corresponded to the ideas of the centralised command th whose authority all deferred.  Referring to previous declarations of the Government,he spoke of the solemn recognition of the movement  in favour  of independence onthe part  of  the races  subject  to the  Austrian Empire.   Italy, fighting for theindependence of Italians still subjected, regarded not only with sympathy  but withan intimate spirit of solidarity the aspirations of other  peoples  for  independence.After   a cordial  reference  to  the  Convention with  the  Czecho-Slovak national committee, he said that Italy  had  for  the  same  reasons  followed similar linesregarding the Jugo-Slav  movement.   Geographical and ethnical conditions made it inevitable  that   the  two  peoples  should  either  maintain cordial  relations or apainful and  difficult  antagonism.  Italy  had  loyally  chosen  her road,  confident that this sentiment would be  reciprocated, and that  not  only concord but intimatecommunion might be  established between the peoples.   Recent great, events  had brought the  prospect of  peace  nearer, though no importance  could be  attributed to  the recent Austrian Note as  an initiative, especially in view  of the subsequentauthentic  interpretation  given by Burian.  It was victory which had  brought peacenearer and the elimination  of one of the enemy Powers.   After a graceful referenceto  the restoration of Serbia, he continued, &quot; Peace will come when the enemy  hasbecome convinced that humanity will no longer endure the shedding of  blood whichdemands not vengeance but  a satisfaction for the noble ideals for which it was  given.Mere renunciation by the enemy of  ignoble aims will not suffice, but certain essentialissues  for the future peaceful life of  the world must  be resolved.   Original  nationalaspirations legitimate  in themselves  have now been  fused in  a great   collectiveaspiration for guarantees against every form of injustice and arrogance.&quot;     Munition Strike. Sir R. Rodd reports that immediately  upon -the announcementof  the German proposals  for an armistice a strike  of  Italian munition workers took- place,   ddie Italian Admiralty  is  convinced that this action has  been promoted by german agents and forms part of the peace offensive.  The  strikers at Naples have since  returned to work  explaining that  they had merely desired to celebrate theoccasion by a holiday.  (See Report No. 88.)                                     JAPAN.     Attitude of New Government towards the War. The following telegram has been.received by Mr. Balfour from Viscount Dchida :  &quot;Having  assumed on the 29th ultimothe portfolio  of  Foreign Affairs in succession to Baron Goto, f bespeak with theutmost  confidence the continuance of  the happy relations  of  mutual trust and regardwhich  have ever  marked the intercourse of our predecessors in  office.  I indulge the
ENEMY  GROUP.                           AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.     Political  Crisis. The  Daily Review  of  October  5th and  7th  describes  thestormy reception given (especially by the Czechs) to Baron Hussareks  speech in theLower House  on October 1st.   The Czech Deputy, M. Stanek, expounded, the Czecho-Slovak programme, and violently attacked  Germany  and Hungary, declaring thatequality should be pronounced between South Slavs, Czechs and  Poles.  The SouthSlav  Deputy,  M. Korosec,  said  that the Premier  had come too late  with nationalautonomy.   Nothing  could any longer  separate  the Croats and Serbs  from theSlovenes.  The Polish Socialist, M. Daszynski, brought forward a projjosal in the nameof all Polish deputies, with the exception of the Conservatives, demanding the restorationof an independent  Poland which should  be composed of all  Polish districts.  .ThePolish question was not a one-sided Austro-Hungarian,  Prussian, or Russian problem.The inrion of Poland must be proclaimed at the International Peace Conference.  Thepolitical importance of the proposal lay in the fact that the Poles&apos; efforts were directed-towards obtaining a united and independent Poland.     The Bale National Zeitung of October 4 th  publishes  a telegram  from its Vienna-correspondent to  the  effect that Hussareks position is  very precarious.   Everyone-speaks of Lammasch as  his probable successor..  The  announcement in the Germano-    t 6G33-2b                              Bconfident  hope that we  may  shortly witness the final vindication  of our common-cause, which shall free the world of menace duel aggression.&quot;    Sir C. Greene reports that on October 2nd Viscount TJchida, at his  reception ofthe Heads of  Missions, informed him that the  new  Government would, within thelimits of possibility, continue  the support  extended by its predecessors to the Allied.cause.   Sir 0. Greene  adds that the Japanese Foreign Office is deeply interested inthe possibilities opened  up by  the collapse  of Bulgaria.   It is  also  engaged  in formulating, in reply to a recmest by the United States Government, its views uponBresident Wilson&apos;s declaration of September 27th (see Report  No. 88 under &quot; PeaceDiscussions &quot;), read in  the  light  of  the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the  ParisEconomic Conference.    Japanese and Korean Tii.ee Crops.-Siv C. Greene reports  that according to thefirst official estimate, the  Japanese rice crop will be 58,982,000 koku and the Korean13,71.8,000 koku, being an increase  of 8&quot;! and 13&apos;2  per  cent, respectively over lastyear&apos;s crops.                                  PORTUGAL.     General Conditions. In a despatch dated September 7th Sir L.  Carnegie reportsindications of unrest in. Portugal.   &quot; The  police in Lisbon, have been  increased and.are  now  always  armed  with rifles, troops occasionally  patrol the streets, arrestscontinue to be made, and searches for concealed arms and bombs, often attended with success, are frequently made both in Lisbon and the provincial towns.   .  .  .   TheMonarchist paper 0 Dia  has lately published alarming articles, stating that &apos; Soviets &apos;have already been formed, and that a catastrophe is imminent.   The Republican andPresidential organs, liOAvever, severe reprimand  0 Via for attempting to disturb  thepublic by assertions which cannot be substantiated.   Owing to the always increasing-cost and scarcity of provisions, caused to some extent by the failure, owing to  the drought of the harvest, the wine crop, and market garden  produce,  discontent among all classes is  rife, especially among  the working  classes  in  the towns  and  thepeasantry in the north.   .  .   .   With the exception of the Secretary of State for theInterior,  the  members of Senhor  Paes&apos;  Government are   .   .  .   quite unfit to and the  President in governing a country confronted wdth so many  grave and complicatedproblems.  The result is that, in spite of  Semhor Paes&apos; laudable efforts at reform, theold abuses continue,  and the real power remains in the bands of  ineompetent  and often corrupt subordinates.   .  .   .&quot;  Trouble  seems likely  to arise  in connection wdth the new rationing regulations.  (And see Report No. 88.)
phile Austrian Press of Burian&apos;s approaching retirement is regarded in Austria  as amanoeuvre to  get him out of  the way, as  the  differences  between Germany  and austria over the Polish question Lave grown more acute than ever (see next paragraph).The Foreign Office learns that  there were disorders in Vienna on October  3rd, andthat there is great  fear  of a revolution in  Austria.  It  is  estimated  that by  nextFebruary there will be literally no food in  the  country.  The Germans are statedto  regard her collapse as inevitable.  They state openly that  they will profit by it,though they wdll do nothing to hasten it, and that it certainly will not prevent them from continuing their defensive  war (and see below).     Poland.- It  was  reported  to  the Foreign Office  on September 20th  that  the  - German Military Party had not given up  hope of annexing  Polish territory as far asthe  banks of the Narew, and that von Idintze was definitely opposed to the Austro-Polish solution.  A report from a good source,  dated  October 2nd, states that thePolish Government is now more than ever decided not to commit itself to any agree-ment wdth the Germans.  The general feeling  in Poland is hostile to Germany, butthere are a few  good Poles  with  Austrian  leanings, who are inclined to accept theAustrian solution as a temporary measure,   ddre Germans, having prevented the Polesfrom creating a  home  army, are   exploiting their fear  that  a  Bolshevist movementmight follow upon a withdrawal of  the  German forces.   According to a report dated october 3rd, Dr. Solf  has declared himself in favour of removing all German troops-from Poland, being convinced that the Powers wo aid never permit Germany to exercise control there.  On October 1st Baron Hussarek  spoke as follows in the Reiebsrath : &quot; Meanwhile our  task is, in many directions, to prepare the way for the future shapingof things that wdll result from the  ruins of  the war-afflicted world.  One of  the mostimportant problems of this kind lies  in the  Polish question.  The Polish State was established by the proclamation  of the two Emperors on November 6th, 1916.  Polandis  on the point of establishing herself as an independent factor in the political world..We shall solve by negotiation and mutual friendliness the  questions arising from thefact of our being neighbours.   But to Poland&apos;s own free self-determination is left thesettlement of the final form of her constitution.   It is known that  there  are  strongcurrents in Poland which  desire to  realise the idea of independence in the form of a close union with the Monarchy and it  cannot be taken  amiss if we  are  sympathetictowards  such endeavours and  try to  facilitate  their path.   The  slightest idea  ofconquest is as remote  from our intentions as is any  sort  of  capitulation.   (Bondinterruptions  from the  Czechs and  Ukrainians.)   We respect Poland&apos;s free  self-determination absolutely,  and we demand from others that  it should also  be respected,if it turns out in a sense favourable for us.&quot;     Fecleralisation Schemes. ddre Foreign Office is informed  that the Emperor Karlhas  decided  to  prepare  a  scheme of fecleralisation  in time to  meet the PeaceConference  wdth  a  fait  accompli.    The Austro-Germans wdll consent if  they are granted full independence as a complete political entity in  themselves  irrespective ofthe provinces in which they happen to reside,  ddre  Hungarians are  ojrposed tofecleralisation ; they would, however, join a  Federation,  not as  a Federal State, but merely  in a  personal  union with Austria, provided they were, given  Bosnia  andHerzegovina  in compensation.  (See also Daily Review, E.P.S., of October 3rd and The-Times of  October 7th,  at page 10.)  The  following  may  be quoted  from  BaronHussarek&apos;s speech of October  1st (see Daily Review of October 4th) :      &quot; ddie future re-modelling of conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina now  demandsevery care and attention.   We have no intention  of abandoning our good  light to-these countries,  due solution of the. Bosnian problem can  only be  a  natural  one.We  must especially  be guided   by considerations  of  the  legitimate wishes  of&apos;,the  races concerned, and we must also safeguard Austrian  interests.  No  one canforce us to  relinquish our  right  ; that can only be clone  by way  of negotiation,in  which case  we  shall  know   how  to  state  and to  carry through our  stand-point.   In this connection we must at least have the assurance that measures will be-taken  corresponding to the  requirements  of the Monarchy.    ddie incorporation ofCroatia and  Slavouia in Dahnatia would be  such a way.  At present, however, it isonly a question of preparatory stepis.  The  decisive word will have  to be spoken bythe  legislative factors.  In any case  only  a constitutional solution and  one corre-sponding to  self-determination will  be considered.   A  speedy conclusion of the-negotiations with  Hungary, who declared  herself in principle  ready to support us,,
will facilitate the final arrangement.  Besides the standpoint  of  absolute equality forall races we must adhere in all questions of national autonomy to the standpoint of safeguarding the whole in the sense of an organisation  comprising various races and operating in their interests.&quot;    Hungary:  suggested  Coalition  Cabinet. The B.  Z.  am  Mittag states  that a plan is on  foot to form  a Coalition Cabinet  in  Hungary.   The idea  is  to takeCounts Tisza, Apponyi and Andrassy into the present Cabinet as Ministers without portfolio.     The Ukrainian Revolt. A Memorandum (G.T. 5882,  dated October 3rd) by theP.LB. draws attention to the very serious clanger wdth which the Ukrainian peasants&apos;revolt threatens the Central Bowers and especially Austria.                                   GERMANY.    The New Administration. A report to the Foreign Office, dated September 20th,states that.an important political crisis was imminent in  Germany.   The influence ofLudendorff 1 had declined, not merely on account of the military reverses, but because hewas regarded as the  man  wdio  misled the Kaiser  by promising him a &quot;peace of victory&quot; in. six months,  thereby  preventing the Reichstag Resolutions  of July 1917from bearing their natural fruit.   The Reichstag was said to be feeble but restive, and determined to  precipitate the fall of the  Government,  which was anxious not  to summon it before November.   The Foreign Office learns that&apos;certain neutral Socialistshad indicated to the German Majority Socialists the necessity for a  show of  sincerityon their part.   The Frankfurter Zeitung of this  date  announced the arrest  of anumber of independent Socialists.  About the end of September the Police Presidentof Berlin was  summoned back  from a holiday  in  Switzerland, as disorders were expected in  Berlin.  The Kreuz Zeitung of September  29th wrote: &quot; The Socialistterms for participation in the Government involve such  incalculable damage to thecountry  that we are  convinced  that nothing must  be left undone to prevent  theestablishment of a democratic Ministry.   The only recourse  seems to lie in a firm.dictatorship, which we are certain would be able to cope wdth any attempts to alienatethe masses from the fulfilment of their duties.&quot;    On  October 2nd  there  took place, in the Palace of the  Imperial Chancellor, a council, at which  the Kaiser presided, and there took part Count  Hertling, GeneralField-Marshal von  Ilindenburg,  Prince Max  of   Baden,  Vice-Chancellor von Payer,Vice-President of the Ministry of  State Friedberg,  Chief of the Civil Cabinet von Berg,and several State Secretaries.   The participation of  von Berg  is stated by Qermaniato have  caused considerable public resentment.   &quot; Herr  von Berg and Count Roclernin participating in  the recent discussions  attempted to  give the Kaiser&apos;s  decree a quite different  interpretation  from  that  of. other  parties.   Whilst the ReichstagMajority Parties attached the greatest importance to the fact that in the new Govern-ment men supported by the peop!e&apos;s confidence were  to take a  big part  in the rightsand  duties  of  the  Government, it  was   now sought to  give  them only a partialparticipation in the Cabinet and to take from, the ranks of the Reichstag all [&apos;? only]three State  Secretaries  out  of  a  total of  ten Imperial Ministers  and four UnderSecretaries.  It appears that this turn of  affairs  led Herr von Payer, who had beenhesitating on the subject, to refuse to undertake the Chancellorship which the MajorityParties had unanimously assigned to him.&quot;  Von  Berg has since resigned.    Commenting on the KaiseFs decree accepting Count  Hertling&apos;s resignation, theRheiniscli Westfalische Zeitung  (October  1st) said:  &quot;It is manifestly not merely amatter of one or two  Social  Democrats  entering the Imperial Government, against which, in present circumstances,  not so much could be said, but of a fulfilment of theSocial  Democratic  demands in  internal  policy,   and a partial commitment to theirprinciples.   We have, therefore,  to expect an unmistakable move to the Left, and the express  democratisation and parliamentarisation of  the Imperial  Government.   a profound change and the complete dislocation of  the foundations of Bismarck&apos;s work    1 It is reported that lie tendered his resignation through Hindenburg&apos;  at a recent Crown Council,and that it was refused as  being- likely to imply the military collapse  of. Germany.  The MajoritySocialists, however, made his non-interference in  political matters a condition of their entry into theG overnment.
-are impending.   All  men  who  think nationally must decline  responsibility for die-development now beginning, and its effects.&quot;                            ,  ,     In accepting the resignation of Count Hertling (see Report No. SS), the Kaiser&apos;has conferred upon him tire Order of  the Black Eagle, and (according to the KolnischeVolkszeitung) has written to the King of Bavaria as follows:  &quot; Count Hertling  hasrepresented  to me, considering the  development of the  domestic  situation in  theEmpire and the concessions recognised by me as necessary under the pressure of  thegeneral world development, that  in  view of his political past  he finds himself nolonger able  to remain at the head  of the  Imperial Government,   As he has  nevermade a secret of his convictions, he believes he can  no longer  count,  on the trustfulcollaboration of Parliament.  I have not been able to disguise from myself the weightof his reasons and have relieved him of the burden of office.&quot;     German Wireless (October 2nd) states : 11 ddie Kaisers message with respect  to the resignation of Count Hertling from the office of Imperial Chancellor is spoken  of bythe whole of the German Press as a step of the highest importance which will greatlyinfluence the present and future development of political life in  the  sense of healthyprogress.   In  the  newspapers  of all political  parties  of every  shade, the  view is reflected that  the  decision of the German Kaiser will open up new  ways, and willcreate a basis for the common working of all parties and all classes  of the people.Even the strongest opponents of the  parliamentary idea on the extreme Right can seethe door opened to a new&apos; period, and are preparing themselves for coming events.&quot;     German Wireless of October  3rd announces the appointment  of  Prince Max ofBaden, as  Chancellor.  According to  the Lokal-Anzeiger, he is to act  as PrussianForeign Minister, but not  as  Prussian Premier.  German  Wireless  of  October 5threports :  &quot; Reichstag Deputies Grober,  Scheideiuann  and Erzberger  have   beenappointed  Secretaries of State, without portfolios,  ddie  announced  appointment ofthe  Reichstag Deputy Bauer to  be Secretary  of  State for the  newly-established.Imperial Labour Office has now taken place,  ddie Secretary of State of  the ImperialColonial Office, Dr. Solf, has been  appointed Secretary of State of the  Foreign  Office.He will not, however, during, the period of the war be separated from  the  position-which he  has  hitherto  occupied, the business  of. which will  be  carried  on byUnder-Secretary of State Dr. Gleim.&quot;     According to Amsterdam Press reports,  a Socialist Deputy,  Herr David, has beenappointed  Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs,  and Herr  Trimborn, representingEssen in the Centrum, is to succeed  Herr von  Wallraf as Secretary for the Interior.According to Germania, the ChaneelloFs  Inner Cabinet wdll be  composed of Herrenvon Payer, Grober, Erzberger,  Scheidemann, and Friedberg.     German  Wireless  of October  4th  quotes  vorwarts  as  saying:  &quot; The new-Government  is  intended  as  a collegiate in the  decisive  resolutions in  which  allSecretaries of State will take part, and the Imperial  Chancellor,  the Vice-Chancellor,and both Secretaries  of State without portfolio, will represent  its closer Committee.The new Government will consider it to be its task  to  bring back peace to the world and the German people ; this must  be lasting, it must be based upon  a League ofNations and must render possible general disarmament.  Political and economic warafter the war must be excluded.&quot;     The Norddeutsche and Vossiselie report the adhesion of the National Liberals to the Majority bloc, wdiose  policy  is set out as  follow-s  by  the  Berliner  Tageblatt: (1)  Adherence to the Imperial  Governments reply to the Papal  Note of August 1st, 1917.  (2) Declaration of readiness to join the  League of. Nations in accordance with the following principles,  namely, that the League  shall comprise all States and be based on. the idea of equality for all  peoples.  Its aim is to safeguard a lasting  peace, independent existence, and free economic development for  all  peoples.  The League of Nations  wdth  all its  resources protects the  States which  join  it in  the  rights guaranteed to them by the League, which recognises their possessions and  excludes all special treaties opposed to the aims of  the League.  The  foundations of the League are  comprehensive,  and comprise  the  extension of  international  law,  reciprocal obligation of States to  submit to  peaceful treatment every conflict which  is  not solvable by diplomatic means, the  carrying  out of the principle of  freedom  of the seas,  the  understanding  regarding  all-round simultaneous disarmament on land and water, the guaranteeing of an open door for economic, civil, and legal intercourse between nations, and international  extension of social legislation and protection for Avorkers.  (3) An unequiwocal declaration regarding  the  restoration of Belgium, and an agreement regarding indemnification.  (4)  ddie peace treaties hitherto concluded must form no hindrance to the general conclusion of peace.  Iu . the  Baltic provinces
of Lithuania and Poland, popular  assemblies are to be created at the earliest possible moment  on a  broad  basis.   These  States,   where  civil  administration  is  to  beintroduced at the earliest possible  moment, are to  settle their own constitutions  andtheir  relations to neighbouring peoples.  (5)   Provides  for  the  establishment of anindependent federal State  of Alsace-Lorraine with full  autonomy corresponding tothe demand of Alsace-Lorraine for a popular assembly.  (C) The carrying out withoutdelay of electoral reform  in Prussia, likewise the endeavour  to bring about suchreform in those Federal States which  are still without it.  (7)  Aims at co-ordinationof the Imperial Government and the summoning of Government representatives from parliament  to  carry out a  uniform Imperial  policy.   The strict  observance  of  allconstitutional responsibility.  The abolition of all military institutions  that  seiwe  forthe exercise of political influence.   (8) Says that  with a view  to the protection of personal  liberty,  right  of meeting,  and the  freedom  of  the Press, prescriptionsregarding  the state  of siege shall immediately  be  amended  and  the censorshiprestricted to questions of relations to foreign Governments, war, strategy, and  tactics,troop movements and  the  manufacture  of war material.   The  establishment of apolitical  control department for all measures taken  on the ground of the stage of siegeis also demanded.     Extracts from the neutral pro-German  or  pacifist Press are  daily being made by german Wireless, as vouching the sincerity of  the new administration.  On October5th Prince Max, in the course of  a long  speech in the  Reichstag, made the  followingstatements :      &quot;In accordance with the Imperial Decree of September  30th the German  Empirehas undergone a basic alteration of its political leadership.  .   .  .   It is  in accord.wdth  the nature  of the  Governmental  method  now introduced by  us that I  lay before   the  Reichstag,  publicly  and without delay, the  principles  by which Ipurpose  conducting  my  gravely responsible office.   These principles were frimly established, in agreement with the  Federated Governments  and wdth the  leaders ofthe Majority Parties of this  honourable House before I decided  to assume  the dutiesof Imperial Chancellor; consequently they contain not  only my own confession ofpolitical faith, but  also that of the overwhelming portion  of the German. people&apos;representatives,  that is to  say, of  the  German  nation which  has  constituted  theReichstag on the basis of  a  general, equal  and  secret  franchise, and  according totheir will.  .  .  .  One  maids  shoulders would be  too  weak  to&apos; carry  alone  the tremendous  responsibility  which falls  upon  the  Government  at  the present time.Only if the people take an active part in  the broadest sense  of the word in  decidingtheir destinies, in other words, if the responsibility also extends to the majority ofthe freely elected political leaders, can the leading statesman confidently assume his part of the  responsibility in the service of the people and the Fatherland.  My resolveto do this has been especially lightened for me by  the fact that the prominent leadersof the labouring class have found  their way into the Government and  to the highestoffices ih the  Empire.  I  see  therein a  sure  guarantee  that the new Government is supported by the firm confidence  of the  broad masses of the people  without wdiosetrue  support their  whole&apos;  undertaking would  be condemned  to failure in advance.Hence, what I say here to-day I say not only in  my own  name  and  in that of myofficial helpers, but also in the name of  the German people.  The programme of tireMajority Parties, upon which I take  my stand, contains first an  acceptance of the answer of the former Imperial Government to the Pope&apos;s Note of August 1st,  1.91.7,  andan unconditional acceptance of the Reichstag  Resolution of July 19th of the same year.It further declares willingness to  join in a general League of Nations  on the  basis of equal rights for all, both the strong and the weak.  It considers the  solution of theBelgian question to lie in  the complete rehabilitation  (imederherstellung) of Belgium,particularly of her independence and her territorial integrity.  An effort shall also bemade to  reach  an understanding  in regard  to the question, of an indemnity.   Theprogramme will not permit the peace treaties, hitherto concluded, to  be a  hindrancein the way of the conclusion of a general peace.   Its particular  aim  is that popularrepresentative bodies shall be formed  immediately on  a broad basis  in  the baltic provinces,  in  Lithuania  and in  Poland.   We  will  further  the   bringing about of the  necessary preliminary  conditions  therefore  without  delay  by  the  intro- duction  of civilian  rule.    All  these  lands  shall regulate their constitution  and their  relations  wdth  neighbouring peoples  without  outside  interference.   In the matter of internal policy  I have  taken a clear and firm stand  through the  mannerin which the formation of  the Government was brought about.  At  1113-  suggestion     6G33-2!-                            C
the  leaders  of  the  Majority  Parties  were  summoned  for direct  advice.    Itwas my  conviction,  Gentlemen,   that  unity  of  Imperial  leadership  should  be-assured not only through the mere schematic party allegiance of the various  membersof the Government.   I considered  the unity of ideas  as almost still more important.I proceeded  from this point  of  view,  and have, in  making my&apos; selections,  laid thegreatest v-eight on the fact that the members of the new Imperial Government standon  the  basis of a just peace  regardless of the war  situation, and that they openlydeclared this to  be their standpoint at the time when wre stood at the height of our military successes.   I am  convinced that the manner  in which Imperial leadershiphas  now been constituted with the  co-operation of the Reichstag, is not somethingephemeral, and that, when peace comes, a Government cannot again be formed whichdoes not find its  support in the Peichstag, and does not  draw its  leaders  from it.War  has  conducted  us beyond the old multifariously disrupted party  life, which made it so  difficult to put into  execution a  uniform  decisive political wish.   Theformation of a majority means the formation  of a political wdll, and an indisputableresult of the war has been that in Germany,  for the first time,  great parties  have joined together in a firm and harmonious programme, and have  thus come into aposition to determine for themselves the fate of  the people,  ddris  thought will neverdie.  This development will  never be  retracted.   And  I trust that so  long  as germany&apos;s fate  is ringed about  by dangers, those sections of the people outside theMajority Parties, and  whose representatives do  not  belong to the Government, will put  aside  all  that  separates  us  and  will  give  to the Fatherland  what  is  theFatherland&apos;s.  This  development  necessitates  an  alteration in  our Constitution^provisions  along the  lines  of  the  Imperial Decree of September 30th, which  shall make it possible  for  those members of  the Reichstag wdio enter the  Governmentto  retain their  seats  in  the Reichstag.  A  Pill to this end has  been submittedto  the  Federal  States,  and  wdll   immediately  be  made  the  object   of  their consideration and decision.....   ddre Message of  the King of Prussia promisinga  democratic  franchise  must  be  fulfilled  quickly  and  completely.  I  do  not doubt also   that those Federal  States which  still lag behind  in the developmentof their constitutional conditions will  also resolutely follow  the  Prussian  example.I here  unshakably  adhere  to the  federative  basis  of the  Empire  as  a  FederalState,  wdiose individual  members  determine  their  internal  constitutional  life incomplete independence-a right  to which Alsace-Lorraine  also has full claim.   Forthe  present, as the example of  all the belligerent  States demonstrates, the extra-ordinary powers which the condition of  siege confers cannot be dispensed with, buta close relationship between the military and civilian authorities must be established.which will  make it possible  that  in all not  purely military  questions,  and henceespecially as to censorship and the right of assemblage, the  attitude of the civilianexecutive authorities  shall make itself  heard and that a final decision shall be placed under the  Chancellobs responsibility.  To this  end an order of  the Kaiser wdll besent to the military commanders.  With September 30th, 1918, the day of the Decree,begins a new epoch  in Germany&apos;s internal history.  ddie  Imperial policy, the  basic principles of which  are therein laid down, is of deciding,importance for the  questionof peace and war.  The striking  force, which the Government  has in its striving for peace, depjends on whether it has behind it the  united, firm and unshakable will of thepeople.  Only if  our enemies feel that the German  people stand united at  the  backof their chosen leaders and  only  then can  words  become deeds.  At  the peacenegotiations  the German Government will  use  its efforts  to the end that the treatiesshall contain provisions concerning the protection  of  labour  and the insurance  oflabourers, which  provisions shall oblige the treaty-making States to institute in  theirrespective lands within a prescribed time  a minimum of  similar  or  at least equallyefficient institutions for the  security of dife  and health as well as for the care  oflabourers in case of  illness, accident or invalidity.&quot;     The Chancellor then announced the  peace proposals made to Mr. Wilson  ; andEerr Fehrenhach, President of the Reichstag, identified the German people and theReichstag with those proposals  (see under &quot; Peace Discussions &quot;).  Doubts as to the sincerity of  Prince  Max are  suggested by perusal  of  his letter  of January 12th  toPrince Alexander of Idohenlohe (see The Times of October 9th, at page 9) in  wdiich he.&quot; quite declines to accept any such thing as Western democracy for Germany &quot; andspeaks  of the  Reichstag Resolution as &quot; the  puling child of fright and the Berlindog-days.&quot;   The Temps points out the  insincerity and inexactitudes  contained in his speech  of August 22nd last, which it  finds difficult to combine  wdth  the  role  of a conciliatory and reforming Chancellor.   Humanite states that the role of intermediary
hitherto  played by him between the  Pan-Germans and the Court does not speciallyrecommend him as the Plead of a Parliamentary Government.   Le Pays speaks of hiswell-known hatred of Prance  and says that the neighbourhood of his Grand Duchyto Alsace  is  not likely  to render  him  conciliatory towards  Prance.  (And  seeG.T. 5915.)     German Wireless of October 4th quotes  Vorioarts  as follows : ,.&quot; As long as  thepeace negotiations have not commenced,  and the hostilities  continue, the defensiveforce of the German nation  must be brought to bear to the highest degree imaginable.The moment of transition from a state of war into a state of peace is psychologically ;dangerous  from the military  point of view.  Woe to the people which puts its arms.&apos;into a corner live minutes too  soon !  The expansion of the national defensive strengthdemands, however, at  the  same, time the maintenance of  order in the interior.   a nation which loses patience at the end of a long Avar and cripples or discontinues  themaintenance  of the interior  administration, is like a sick man who, in the madness ofhis delirium,  tears off his  bandages and  jumps out  of bed.  . It may bring him fora moment a physical relief from a tension which he finds hard to bear, but he wdll haveto pay for  it  wdth terrible pains, and in the end wdth death.&quot;     A Memorandum (G.T. 5883,  dated October 3rd)  emphasizes that  it is  not  somuch the forms of the German constitution as the spirit of the nation with which theAllies are at issue.   (See also Report No-. 88 and under &quot; Peace Discussions.&quot;)     Prussian Franchise Reform. German Wireless  of October  3rd reports: &quot;TheConstitutional  Committee of  the Prussian House  of  Lords  has decided upon  theintroduction of equal, secret, and direct suffrage in  accordance with the Governmentproposal, granting a  supplementary vote for persons  over 40 years old.  The Pressdeclares that this  decision has brought about  a settlement of the suffrage questionwhich fulfills all  reasonable  expectations, and the Press expects that the House ofRepresentatives will  drop  its resistance towards  the pre-reform  attitude  of  theHouse of Lords, thus doing  away wdth  the cause of  many  domestic conflicts, andalso  establishing in  Prussia a  united  domestic  front.&quot;   Vorioarts criticises  the supplementary vote, pointing out  that soldiers and  the  working classes are likelyto be prejudiced thereby.     German Colonies and Raw  Materials. The Kolnisclic Volkszeitung  (October 1st)gives  the  following report of solf&apos;s speech at Munich on  &quot;  War and the Colonies &quot;before an  audience which included the  King of  Bavaria :  &quot; The  regaining  of  our-colonies  is a task of national importance, which is not eclipsed by any other.   Thetropical  and  sub-tropical lands  supplied  50 per cent, of all the raw  materials forwhich we  and  our industries  are  dependent on foreign countries.   The  presentsubstitute  materials cannot suffice for  peace.  For  the wool alone  Germany wouldhave to  keep 50,000,000 sheep,  which is practically impossible.   The supply of rawmaterials, which will be  much more difficult  in the  future,  is the weakest point of-our world economy.   Without colonies of our own we must  remain dependent on thearbitrariness of foreign countries.  When war  broke  out we were making excellentprogress with our colonies.   We were able successfully to oppose monopoly attemptsof other States.   Commercial treaties offer no guarantee.   In  die  French coloniesequality of treatment  only existed on paper.  We, on  the  other hand, have adheredfirmly to commercial freedom, which still  corresponds to our views.  We must makea breach in the enemy&apos;s endeavours to. isolate  us by means of our own colonies.   an open door  for trade will be  one of  the most important demands at the  conclusion ofpeace.....The Imperial Government adheres firmly to its demand for the return of our African and South Sea possessions, as well as  a fresh partition of Africa  suchas to consolidate  our scattered possessions.  Belgium, Portugal and France possessexcessively large stretches of territory.   We do not want the lion&apos;s share.&quot;     Mittel-Europa. A report to the Foreign  Office  dated  September 20th  declares that the idea of  Mittel-Furopa  is dead, having been killed  by the  opposition ofAustria  and  Bulgaria,  and by the fact that  sufficient  quantities  of  raw material would not be obtainable from the  East.   It is stated that Professor  Brentano, ofMunich, has  been put  at the head of  a campaign  (assisted  by Professor Delbruck)In  favour  of Free  Trade,  directed  at  once against  Mittel-Europa   and  BritishProtectionism.

repudiating the conduct  or  M. Sjoesteen in having published in Sweden &quot; articles which were malicious in tone and sensational in colour &quot;  about a country which hadtrusted  him  (see  Report  No.  87).   According  to  a Stockholm Press  telegram,.&quot; M. Sjoesteen replied that German propaganda always tried, to use neutral journalists-to further its aims.  He himself formerly took part in this  activity, but  later foundthat it was against Sweden&apos;s interests and his own  Democratic  principles.   He addsthat he  regards  with deep  satisfaction  the  step he  took in  order to reveal thecharacter of German political pretensions, and he  warmly  hopes that the Germanpeople, by  a  democratic breakthrough,  will&apos; throwr down this  dangerous policy ami orepare tire way for peace.&quot;     Cholera. l&apos;!r.

ARGENTINE.    Attitude towards Great  Britain  and the, Allies. Sir E. Tower reports that tire-sentiments of the Argentine public and Press are now almost entirely pro-Ally.  he himself was received  on September 29th by the Governor of the Province of buenos aires with great ceremony.   On October 2nd  demonstrations took place to celebratethe departure of  the first  Jewdsh contingent, which carried  colours adapted  from the-Argentine  flag.   ddre  Argentine  Foreign  Minister  has repeatedly expressed, hisgratification at the military successes  of the Allies.   It-would seem that the Argentineis now ready to side openly wdth the Allies but  for the attitude of the President.The latter has been for  the past fortnight in constant  touch with the special ChileanAmbassador (see  Report No. 88 under &quot; Chile &apos;.:),  but no indications have so far been.given of-any new policy regarding the war.

DENMARK.    Inter-Scandinavian Press Congress. The Foreign Office learns that the discussions of the Dress  Congress at  Copenhagen (see Report  No. 87)  showed no  sign ofGerman  influence.  A resolution was passed in  favour of centralising telegram andnews  bureaux in  each country and  of  assurances  being  given  to the Press inregard  to  their  management.   It was generally realised  that  Scandinavia couldnot be independent of imports  from the Allied Countries.                                   FINLAND.     The Withdrawal of German  Troops. The Foreign  Office  is informed  that  onOctober  5th  15,000 German troops  embarked from  Helsingfors for  an unknowndestination. .  It is also reported that over 5,000 left Pfango last week, and  that others are being shipped from Wasa.  According to an estimate received, the total Germanforce in Finland is now reduced to 6,000 men.   (And  see Report No.  88.)  It isstated that  a request has  been made to the Germans to remain, as there are fears ofa Bolshevist outbreak, and that  in anticipation of such an outbreak  many SwedishFinns are leaving the country.  (Comment  is  made on the reported co-operation ofRed Finns with  British troops  in Karelia.   Atrocities are being attributed to thesemen, and it seems to be believed-  that they intend to attack Finland.   His Majesty&apos;sConsul  has spoken  to the Finnish  Foreign  Minister, deprecating the permission ofpunitive or other volunteer expeditions beyond the border of Finland, and reiteratingthat the British Government has  no design  to  attack the country.  Mr. Lindiev uraresthat steps should be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government  for the reconciliation of theRed and White leaders.)   The pro-German Finns are much  depressed  at  the presentturn of events, realising that  they have made  a bad  bargain with  Germany  andsacrificed  any claim to Allied  sympathy.  The  suggestion has been made that apolitical and  economic rapprochement&apos; between  Finland and  the Allies might  be facilitated  if the latter would refuse to recognise the Finnish-German commercial and other  Treaties  (see Reports Nos. 50  and 75),  which,  as  examples  of Germanrapacity, are in some degree comparable to  the Treaties of Brest and Bucharest.     Constitution. The Foreign  Office learns that the Finnish Government is nowwaiting on  military developments in the West before committing itself  to the election of Prince Friedrich Karl, which vras originally fixed for October 1st.  The postpone-ment is  taking the form of discussions on  the constitutional question, and various proposals as  to the powers  of  the Finnish  Monarchy  have  been  submitted to aCommittee  of the  Diet.   Meanwhile, the Prince  has  announced that  he will  onlyaccept the  throne on a  unanimous  vote, and the Agrarian Party has declared its,intention to abstain from voting.     Discussing  the recent  Austrian Peace  Note, the Arheiter Zeitung (see DailyReview, E.P.S., of October 3rd) observes : &quot; And  now  consider what effect the newsthat Prince Karl  of Hesse, a brother-in-law of the German Emperor, and a PrussianGeneral of  Infantry, has declared himself ready at  this moment to accept the Crownof Finland  is  likely to have in Entente countries.   We do not discuss the  questionwdrether  the&apos; introduction of  the monarchy in  Finland  really corresponds  to the will of the democratic  Finnish  peoxole;  we  do not   discuss the  question wrhether  thegentlemen  who have offered this German Prince the Finnish Crown are the genuinerepresentatives of  the Finnish  nation; nor   the question wdtether,   after  all  theexperience  which the G erman Empire has  had wdth this  export  of monarchs, it  canstill really  believe that the appointment  of  a German monarch  in Finland will bringthe smallest advantage to the German nation.   No, we only wish to raise the questionof how this foundation of a new German dynasty is likely to serve the cause of peace.If anybody washed to help the Entente Governments to palliate in the eyes of their people the  rejection of the Austrian peace proposal, they could not have found a moreserviceable incident than this candidature to the Finnish throne.&quot;     Reported  Finnish-German  Aerial Enterprise. A Press message of October 2ndfrom Stockholm  states: &quot; It is   reported  from  Helsingfors that the  &apos; Finnish  air traffic Company,&apos; working  in  co-operation wdth  the  General Electric Company ofGermany (Allgemeine Elektricitats Gesellschaft) intends to establish a daily passenger     6o;?3-2t-                                n

The German company about six months ago  tried to gain a footing in. Sweden for  the same  purpose, but failed  to obtain a concession.   Jdre.Swedish papers remark  that the Germans have  evidently found the Finns  easier todeal with and  say this is  another  example of the reckless way in which the Finnsare  allowing the Germans to get a firm grip on their country.-  They regard it asprobable  that the Germans will in any case be refused a  licence to  establish any international air traffic line with Stockholm either as a terminal or as an intermediatestation.&quot;     Supplies for Swedish Subjects. The Foreign Office instructs Mr. Olive, Mr. Barclayand.  Sir R. Rocld that  the British and French Governments will not oppose the export to Swedish subjects in Finland of the supplies mentioned in  Report No. 88, providedthat the distribution thereof is controlled by the Allied Consuls at Helsingfors.                                 LUXEMBURG.     Message from the  New Foreign Minister. Mr. Robertson  transmits  a  cordialmessage from M. Renter, newly appointed Foreign Minister of Luxemburg, to HisMajesty,!? Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.                                     MEXICO.     Mexico  and  France. Mr.  Thurstan reports the  resignation of Senor  Nieto,Mexican Minister to France. Mr. Thurstan is inclined to think that the French Charged&apos;Affaires in Mexico (with an eye to  the maintenance  of local French interests) willrecommend his  Government  to accept a successor  to Senor Nieto.   (See reports nos. 84, 87, and 88.)     Mexico and Great  Britain. Mr.  Thurstan  has received information  which,  ifcorrect,  would  suggest that Carranza  is uneasy  as to  the possible effects of his attitude towards Great Britain.     Mr.  Barclay transmits  a suggestion that the cprestion of recognising  Carranzarequires  reconsideration in  view of  (1)   the apparent inability  of  other factionsto unite and  displace him ;  (2) the necessity of combating German influence, and(3) the clauger that British commercial interests  may be  weakened  not  only  by theaction  of the Mexican Government, but  also through  competition.  . The ForeignOffice  instructs  him that  it  is for Carranza  to  make the first move ;   and  thatCarranza&apos;s discourtesy  to Mr.  Thurstan  and his persistent  confiscations and pro-Germanism do not warrant the sending of  a British Minister to Mexico at the presenttime.     Mexican  Finances. Mr. Thurstan   is  informed  that  payments  to mexican government  employes  were  on September 29th  made in  American  gold.    Theexchange on New York has recently  fallen  considerably.  It is rumoured, in Mexicanfinancial circles  that money is  being lent  to  the  Mexican Government by the United.States.                                NETHERLANDS.     New Economic  Advisory  Committee. The  Daily Review reports:  &quot;It is stated.officially (Uctober  2) that a department is to be established at the Foreign Office, underthe authority of  the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to further unity of policy in economic relations and negotiations with foreign countries.     &quot;  Jonkheer Snouck Hurgronje, a departmental chief  at the Foreign Office, willbe  the head of  the  department, and he  will be assisted by  an Advisory Councilconsisting of  MM. Colijn, Loder, Yan Aalst, Heldring,  Kroeller  and Waller.   Arepresentative of the Ministry of Agriculture will be  present  at meetings.   Thedepartment will begin work immediately in view of the renewal shortly of  economicnegotiations with the belligerents. A further object of the reform is to make a seriouspreparation to deal with  economic  questions wdth  which the Foreign Office will be faced after the war.&quot;
     The Foreign  Office is informed that Mr. Colijn  is the moving  spirit of the new committee, and that the Netherlands  Government  intends that it shall  graduallyabsorb the  powers  at present exercised by the Netherlands Oversees  Trust.     Negotiations with Belligerents. Mr. Robertson emphasises that what the Dutchrequire is  food and the assurance thereof by a general  agreement.   With regard  tofuel, the Foreign  Office instructs  Mr.  Barclay that  the  Dutch output has  greatlyincreased during the war, and that Holland  is  now almost self-sufficing  except forsome gas coal.  An offer  (as suggested by the United States War Trade Board) ofcoal to be  fetched from America by Dutch vessels  would  only tend  to revive theshipping controversy.  . Holland  now  principally depends  on. Germany for iron andsteel, cement, potash, salt, oil and chemicals ; it is hoped  that arrangements can bemade for the supply of most of these from neutral sources.     Rice requirements of Dutch Bast Indies. The Foreign Office  learns  that about700,000 tons of imported rice are  needed by the population of the Dutch East Indies.It is probable  that in  consideration  of such supplies  the Governor-General would.facilitate the export of quinine and other commodities required by the Allies (and seeReports Nos. 67, 69, and 70).                                   NORWAY.    Germany and the new Minefield. German Wireless of October 4th comments onthe new Norwegian minefield  as apparently due  to English  diplomatic  pressure.(And see Reports Nos. 80-82, 84 and 87.)    German-N orioegian Safe-conduct Agreement. The Foreign  Office  has authorisedSir M.  Findlay to inform  the  Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association  that while HisMajesty&apos;s  Government does not  at present object  to the carriage  of German safe-conclucts  in themselves, or propose on that ground alone to bring vessels into british ports, it is nevertheless unable  to recognise any limitation of its rights either to stopor divert vessels into port  for examination, or, if the conditions of the safe-conductnegative neutrality, to take such  measures as -the case may require.   His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  cannot give any guarantee with  respect to  the  agreement between theNorwegian Shipowners&apos; Association and  the German Government.  The association is reminded of its obligations under the  Tonnage Agreement, and of  the regulations of His Majesty&apos;s Government; vessels complying with these regulations have not beeninterfered with in the past, nor is any change of  this policy in contemplation.    Spitsbergen. The Foreign Office has authorised  Sir M. Findlay and Mr. Clive  toexplain to the Norwegian  and Swedish Governments that the recent action  by theNorthern  Exploration Company in Spitzbergen (see Report No. 88) was taken withoutthe knowledge of  His Maiesty&apos;s Government,  and must not be  regarded as implyingany change in British policy.  Trespasses, however,  on a considerable scale had. been committed upon  the  Company&apos;s claims,  and such  infringements of  British  rightscannot be  recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    The Sunday Times (October 6th) contains an article on the Spitzbergen expedition.(And  see Reports  Nos. 60-62, 75, 78 and 88.)                                    SPAIN.    Cabinet Crisis. Sir A.  Hardinge  reports  that  on October  2nd  Seiior Alba,Minister of Public Instruction, tendered his resignation,  ostensibly on the  groundthat he had been unable to  obtain  for primary schoolmasters  a minimum  salary of1,500 pesetas.   Mr. Vaughan  reports that  Senor Alba&apos;s persistence in maintaininghis resignation has resulted in a general Cabinet crisis, and  that on  the  return to madrid of the King  (who is  suffering  from scarlet fever), the Prime Minister mayoffer the resignation of the whole Government.  It is thought by some that Senor Albawas in reality anxious to leave the Government before  it should, break up,  so as tobe able to obtain a more important position in the next Administration,  and to gain
lay an alliance with, the Left a  personal following greater  than that  of  the  Liberalfactions  either  of Sehor  Prieto  or Count Romanones.  Latest  information  fromSir A. Hardinge suggests that the National Government  may still remain, withoutAlba, and take drastic action regarding the German ships.     The  German Submarine   Campaign. Mr.  Vaughan reports that the  SpanishS.S.  Francoli, requisitioned by the Spanish government, and on voyage from Alicanteto Algiers, to fetch phosphates for the Spanish market, was sunk on  October 1 st off cape Palos.  Mr. Budd reports that the Spanish S.S. Mercedes, proceeding in convoy from Bilbao to Cardiff, with minerals, was ou October 4th torpedoed without  warningoff San Sebastian, with  the loss of 20  men  out of  a crew of 29&quot;  A. submarine isstated to.have hred  on  Spanish fishing vessel,  and ordered  her back to port.  SirA. Hardinge reports that the  Spanish S.S. Valfredn, bringing cotton from the UnitedStates to.Spain,  has also been  sunk.  His Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consul  at FerroP states thatthe seconds in command of U  23 and U 40 are still at liberty and moving about freelyin the neighbourhood.  The Foreign  Office instructs Sir A. Hardinge to request  a restriction of their movements.     Postal Strike. ddie Foreign  Office  learns that on October 2nd  a general strike of postmen was declared in Madrid,   ddre General Post Office was forcibly cleared  ;arrests were made and some  men wounded.  Letters we,re  delivered by soldiers inthe evening.  Postmen in Bilbao and other parts of the country adhered to the strike,which, however, ceased on  October 4th on instructions from the Central Committee.     Influenza. Mr.  Vaughan reports that the  present  epidemic of influenza is very severe all  over  Spain,  and that  the  percentage of deaths  is  high,   ddie  diseaseassumes various forms, attacking the brain in some cases, the abdomen or respiratoryorgans in others, and chiefly affects persons between the ages of 25 and 40.                                   SWEDEN.     Action regarding German Mines. -Mr. Clive reports that the Swedish Governmentis formulating a claim against the  German Government  in respect  of  the sinking ofthe Gunliild, based on a protest made  last June against  the  laying without previouswarning of mines  in the open  sea frequented by Swedish fishing  craft.  The SwedishMarine Department, while not denying that the  Germans have been laying new mineswithout  warning,  states that  the Gunhild struck a  German  mine which was  laidlast June.     The London Agreement. Mr. Clive and the French and Italian Ministers have informed the Swedish Foreign Minister  that their Governments adhere to the Notepresented by the United States Government regarding the apparent failure of sweden to observe  the  terms of the  London  Agreement (see Reports Nos. S3 and  87), andthat they wall consider  the Swedish  reply to that Note as  addressed collectively tothe four Allied representatives.     The Daily Hevieio of October 7th reports : &quot; It is officially announced (October 4th)that the following commodities have arrived in Sweden under the agreement withthe Allied Powers :-20,000 tons  of corn, 26,000 tons  of cattle food, 5,000 tons of coffee, 400 tons of cocoa and chocolate, 2u0 tons of  dried fruits, 100 tons of vegetableand  animal oils, 1,800 tons of  lubricating  oils, 20,000 tons of paraffin oil, 3,300 tonsof cotton,  2,000 tons of harvest  twine,  150 tons of cork bark,  4-00 tons of tobacco,2,000 tons of copper,  and 22,000 tons of raw phosphate.&quot;     Bolshevism. The Foreign Office learns that the Swedish Government is watchingwdth some concern the activities of the Bolshevist propaganda in Sweden, wdiich areheavily financed.                                SWITZERLAND.     Swiss Supplies. Mr.  Barclay reports that  the  United States War  Trade board is still anxious that the negotiations with Switzerland should take place at Washington ;it will, however, keep in touch upon all points with, the  British and French repre-sentatives.  The Foreign Office instructs  Mr. Barclay to explain the preferability. of comprehensive discussions at  Berne or  Paris.  (See  also Reports Nos. 70, 72-74, 77,78, 82, 85 and 88.)
I)17                                         URUGUAY.           Credits to Great  Britain  and  France. Mr. Mitchell Innes  reports that on(fl     October 4th the  Uruguayan Government  introduced  a  Bill for the provision of  a       credit of $1.5,000,000 to France, and an increase to $30,000,000 of the credit to Great       Britain without guarantees for two years.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.       (N.B. Countries are arranged in. alphabetical order under this heading.)    General. The most notable events under  this heading this week are (1)  the reply  of President Wilson to Prince Max&apos;s  appeal;  (2) the absence of any reply, forthe present, to  the Austro-Hungarian appeal; and (3) the fact  that Turkey has  not made  a similar appeal, in  spite of announcements from  Berlin  and Vienna that  she would do so.    German policy is based, as usual, purely  upon the military situation.   There are indications that the German Government recognises that both Austria-Hungary  and turkey are  likely to be  detached  from  the  Alliance,  and intends tdtimately to concentrate all German forces on the  Western Front, while making every endeavour,by appeals to Socialist and  other international  organisations  in  enemy countries, toshake the determination of the Allies  to dictate the terms of peace.    The prospects of a continued enforcement of the  terms of the Bucharest  peaceupon  Rumania seem now to be  very doubtful ; the chance  of  the  opening of  theDardanelles,  as a result of a possible breakaway by Turkey from German influence,bears upon this question very materially.    Austria-Hungary. According to a report from Sir H. Rumbold of September 28th(received October 5th), based on reliable authority, the Austro-Hungarian Governmentwere then of opinion  that the good  effect produced  on Neutrals  by the Vienna PeaceNote more than counterbalanced the opposition to be faced in  the German Press,    According to later reports, dated October  3rd and 8th, there were indications  thatthe Emperor Charles or the Austro-Hungarian Government  may  take further steps toobtain peace while the army was still  in being  and  the territory of  Austria-Hungaryintact.   Latest reports  (Mr.  Robertson)  indicate that  Austria-Hungary means tonegotiate for immediate peace under any conditions.    Count cle Salis (Vatican) on October 5th forwarded a report that Austrian peace proposals, although sent to the French Government, were not sent to the Italian.   the daily  Review of  October 3rd-4th contains further precis of the comments in  theAustrian Press  about  the Vienna Peace Note, of which the full text is given.    Belgium. The Daily Review of October 3rd  quotes extracts from various references to Belgium in the  speeches by German politicians, and the  official or unofficial offers of a separate peace to Belgium  b^v Germany, together with a  useful comment by theIndependence Beige upon the Belgian attitude.    Brazil. According to reports  from Sir A.  Peel, dated October 7th, the BrazilianForeign Minister has published in the Press  the Government&apos;s  reply to the Viennanote,  stating that. Brazil must consult her Allies  before considering the proposal.    Bulgaria. On October 1st Lord Granville  was informed by the Foreign office that the arrangements made with Bulgaria were in no  sense  to  be regarded as termsof peace, which could only be settled at the  general peace  conference.   The  recentagreement wdth the Bulgarian Government  was a military armistice, entered into bythe Commander-in-Chief of the Allied armies.     The  Foreign Office  learns on  reliable authority, dated October 1st, that  the surrender of Bulgaria was decided, upon by King Ferdinand  after  a conference  withthe leading  statesmen representing  the principal political authorities  in Bulgaria.German Wireless of  October 3rd quotes the opinion of the Bulgarian Generalissimoon the question   of  the Bulgarian  armistice.   This has  appeared in  the  Press.Admiralty Report No. 336  gives  a  short precis  of  the  terms  of  the Bulgarianarmistice.     (See also under France and United States.)

IS     Denmark. On  October 8th,  Lord Kilmarnock  quoted an article by ProfessorNikolai in  the  National Ticlende,  emphasising-  the right of the Entente to demandguarantees, and recommending them to form a League of Nations at once.     France. Lord Derby, on October 6th and  8th, furnished a precis  of articles in-the French Press  discussing the peace terms,  and the conditions which  germany would be likely to accept,  ddie Temps observes that  Douai is burning while PrinceMax talks of. humanity,   ddie  Homme  Fibre  adds that &quot; Germany&apos;s democratic falsenose will not take  us in.&quot;     On  October  6th Lord  Derby reported  a  decision by the Congress  of NationalSocialists to approach President Wilson, and  inform him of the Socialist Party&apos;s iews about  the  German and Austro-Hungarian peace  proposals.  On October  7th  lord derby gave the text of the above-mentioned Socialist message to President Wilson.German Wireless appears to derive satisfaction  from  this action by French Socialists(October 8th).                    -     On October 6th Lord Derby further  reported the  opinion of the French Govern-liient that  the  present  object  is to ensure  solely the complete  carrying out of the bulgarian  armistice, which is necessary  for  the safety  of  the  Allied  forces inthe field.     Lord Derby on October 6th called attention to an article by M.  Cachin in L&apos;Heurecriticising  the secret diplomacy still said to  be  carried on between &quot;certain EntenteGovernments.&quot;  The British and French are indicated.  On October 9th Sir R. Wingatecalled  attention to allegations  by the Havas  and ReuteFs  agencies about France and syria,     On October 9th Lord Derby reported action taken by the French Foreign Officeto prevent  offers of intervention by Neutrals.     Admiralty  Report  No.  336  gives  a  precis  of the reception  by the Frenchnewspapers of  the Bulgarian  armistice.  The Daily Review of October 3rd gives acomplete survey of French opinion upon peace questions up-to-date,     Germany. Sir H. Rumbold on  September  30th (received  October 5th), October6th and 7th, forwarded reports to the effect (1) that M. dhoelstra, as the &quot; only friend &quot;amongst neutral  Socialists  of  the German  Majority  Socialists, had threatened that,if they did not  agree to his terms, he would represent  to the Dutch Socialist ExecutiveCommittee that they had refused to act up to the fundamental principles of Socialism.The terms  include unconditional restoration  of  Belgium, and an indemnity, revisionof the twro Eastern treaties, and a referendum in Alsace-Lorraine; (2)  that  Socialistdelegates recently insisted to the German Government upon peace proposals being-formulated immediately ;  and (3) that, as far as concerns Giermany, the latest peaceproposal, in conjunction with Austria-Hungary  and Turkey, is a manoeuvre.     A. report from Sir II. Rumbold (October 3rd) indicates the King of Bavaria asbeing the initiator of the Vienna Peace Note, and an opponent both of Count Hertlingand of the  military leaders in Germany in connection  wdth peace policy.     Mr. Robertson on  October 4th predicted the appeal to President Wilson, and added, on the same authority, that should Turkey make a separate peace, an influentialportion of the Reichstag, with the support of the leaders of the Army, would favourconcentration of troops for home defence, and sacrifice of  all Near Eastern interests.Austria-Hungary  would then be  left a free hand, provided that,  should  she  makepeace  separately,  she  would  remain neutral.   This  may  be  a threat  to  abandonAustria-Hungary.     On October  7th Lord Kilmarnock (Copenhagen) reported on  reliable-authority that the Kaiser recently held an important conference, attended  by Hindenburg andothers, and decided that the best chance of getting peace would be by demoralising,by peace propaganda, the workers and Socialists in enemy countries, and Prince Max&apos;snomination was a  step in this&apos;direction.  A report from Sir II. Ruinbold (October 8th)indicates the insincerity of Prince Max&apos;s peace policy.     German Wireless  of  October  4th-7th   publishes Press  extracts  criticisingMr. BalfouPs and President  Wilson&apos;s  attitude towards peace  negotiations.  On  the7th the text of  the appeal to President Wilson is given, but without  the signature ofPrince Max.  Between the 6th and 9th German  Wireless has again  been full of  peace and League of Nations proposals.     Idie Daily  Summary (ML 6 B.) for October 4th  gives  useful  information  aboutthe naval situation in the Black Sea,  resulting from the Brest Treaty  and subsequentseizure of Russian ships.
     The Daily  Review (Enemy  Press Supplement)  for  October 3rd gives extracts from the Press upon peace proposals.     The Political Intelligence Department  (October  3rd) provide a valuable memo-ranclum (G.T. 5883) on German peace overtures.     (See also under Russia.)     Great Britain. Deporting for the week ending  on October 2nd.  the Ministry ofLabour emotes criticisms in the Labour Press&apos; of the Inter-Allied Labour and  SocialistConference.     In the  Daily Review of October  7th attention  is drawn to a report  emanating from Vienna and published in  the  Berliner Tageblatt,  that &quot; the British  reply  to count BuriaiFs Peace Note has been  received  in Vienna,  It is couched in a politetone, and  requests  the Austro-Hungarian Government to specify its  peace proposalsmore precisely.&quot;     Greece. In  connection with  Greek policy as affecting  peace, it  seems possiblethat, after fulfilling her Treaty  obligations to Serbia,  Greece  may desire some pro-spective advantages as a price for farther participation.   (Lord Derby, October 8th.)     Holland. According to a  report from  Lord  Derby dated October 3rd, the dutch government, at the request of the Government of Austria-Hungary, has expressed  tothe  French  Government  its willingness to offer  hospitality for  meetings of  repre-sentatives of the belligerents.  The French Government, in reply, does not contemplate any such meetings.  Reports of October 9th state that Dutch Ministers in London andBerlin have been summoned  to The  Hague, and the  German Minister there has been summoned suddenly to Berlin.  Peace  proposals, and the  German reply to PresidentWilson, are  indicated as. the reasons.     The Daily Rexneio  for October 4th gives a useful  summary of the  reception  ofthe  Vienna  Note  in  the Dutch Press, which  &quot;has   always  advocated peace by negotiation.&quot;     (See also under Germany above.)     Rumania. Sir H. Rumbold on.  October  2nd indicated, the probability  of theGermans sending strong forces to hold Rumania to the terms of the Bucharest Treaty.According to  Admiralty Report  No.  33b, Mackensen is  taking strong  measures  toenforce the execution of the terms of the treaty, especially as  affecting demobilisation and surrender of  material.     Russia. According to a report  from  Mr. Olive (Stockholm,  October 6th), the bolshevist policy is to try and excuse themselves for the  Brest Treaty,  and  to take the credit  for bringing about the present situation in  Germany and  Austria-Hungary[really brought about  by armies whose task the Bolshevists made infinitely  moredifficult by releasing the armies of the Central  Powers from the Eastern front].     The New Europe for October 3rd contains a very valuable  summary of  the  newRusso-German supplementary treaties.     (See also under Ukraine)     Sweden. The  Daily Review  (October 4th) reports that Liberal papers  have been more inclined, of late to regard the question  of  peace  from the Entente point of view.On October  Sth-9th, Mr. Olive (Stockholm) called attention to an article by M. Brantingadvocating a dictated, peace, and  criticisms in the Swedish Press.     Switzerland. The Admiralty (No. 336) report that the general view in Switzer-lancl is that  the Vienna Note would have no  effect upon the policy of the Allies.   the daily  Review for  October  4th gives a useful summary of the reception of the Note inthe Swiss Press.     Turkey-Various reports (.F.O. 1470, 1768,177.0, 1772,1776, 2089 of October5th)Indicate a wish by the Turkish Government to enter into peace negotiations.  Thepolicy of  His Majesty&apos;s Government is not to encourage discussions of proposals for peace  wdth  representatives  not  properly   accredited by the Government.   If  an armistice  is desired application  should be made to General Allenby.  (F.O. 1225,1.449.)                &apos;     [M.B. No news has yet been received  of  the official participation of  Turkey inthe  appeal  of the Central Powers  to President Wilson, which participation was-anticipated in reports from Berlin and Vienna.   German Wireless of October 8th wras-still at fault on the subject.]
     The Admiralty (Report No. 33G) report that Turkish ageats in Switzerland are trying to establish touch with Entente representatives.     [A report in the Daily Summary (M.I.  6 B.) about German exploitation of Turkey,and the withdrawal of German  residents from Constantinople, indicates that  there  is     wgood foundation for reports of separate peace&apos;advances by Turkey.]     The Political Intelligence Department on  October 4th issued a valuable printedmemorandum (G.T. 5908)  containing a  complete  report upon  Turkish treaties and negotiations since the Brest Treaty.     (See also under Germany.)               -                                          *     Ukraine. According to Russian. Wireless  of October 8th, the Bolshevists are onthe eve of a rupture of the peace negotiations with the Ukraine,  which would  &quot;give a free hand to  the partisans of a union between Great Russia and  the Ukraine.&quot;     United States. Mr. Barclay on October   7th reported that Press articles were unanimously opposed to entertaining the peace proposals of the  Central Powers.     ddre following reply to the German appeal to President Wilson has now been published.  References to  the &quot; subsequent addresses,&quot; referred to in the reply, weregiven  in a note under the heading of &quot; Peace Discussions &quot; in last week&apos;s Report.MAX, PRINCE  OF BADEN, IMPERIAL CHANCELLOR,       ddre following is the Rote from the  Secretary  of  State to the  Swiss  Charged&apos;Affaires:                                                        ddre Department of State,                                                         October 8th,  1918.     Sir:  I have the honour to  acknowledge, on behalf of&apos;the President, your  Note  of-October 6th, enclosing a communication from  the  German  Government to thePresident; and I am instructed by the &quot;President to request you  to make the following-Communication to the Imperial German Chancellor :      Before making  a  reply to  the request of the  Imperial  German  Government,and  in order  that  that  reply  shall be as  candid  and straightforward as  tire-momentous interests involved require, the President of the United  States deems itnecessary to  assure  himself of the  exact meaning of  the Note of the  Imperial&apos; Chancellor.   Does   the Imperial  Chancellor mean   that  the  Imperial   GermanGovernment accepts the terms laid down by the  President in his  address to  theCongress of the United States  on January Stir last and  in subsequent  addresses, andthat its object in entering  into discussions would be  only to agree upon the practicaldetails of their application ? The  President feels bound  to say, with regard  to thesuggestion of an armistice, that he would not  feel at liberty to propose a cessation ofarms  to  the Governments with  wdiich  the  Government of  the United  States is associated against the Central  Bowers so long  as the  armies of those  Powers are upon their  soil.   ddre good faith of any  discussion would  manifestly depend,  upon   the consent of the Central. Powers  immediately to  withdraw their forces everywhere from invaded territory.     The President  also feels  that he is justified  in asking-  whether the  Imperial Chancellor is speaking merely for the constituted authorities of the Empire who have- so far conducted the Avar.   He deems  the  answer to these questions vital from every point of view.     Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my high consideration.                                                                ROBERT LANSING.
