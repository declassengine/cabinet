SECRET.AJHNFEOdATION  OF THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  CENTRAL                           REPORT  No.  83.    All indications tend to show that the German retreat is adding  to the difficultiesof her foreign policy.  The firm attitude  adopted  and  maintained  by Spain in thematter of German submarine warfare (page 12), the delay and reported failure of theconference at Berlin between the representatives  of  Finland and the  BolshevistGovernment  (page  16), the disturbed state of  Austria (page 7),  and the protestsreported from Russia (page 16), are  evidence  of  the waning influence of Germany.In the Western and General Report for  the week ending July 31st it  was statedthat there was reason for believing that the Russo-Finnish  Conference would  be  used by Germany to force Finland into war with the  Entente, and the transfer of the seat of the negotiations from Reval  to Berlin gave further colour  to  this  suspicion.  If itshould prove to be  true  that  the  negotiations  have  been broken off we shall  have reason  for satisfaction.  No  doubt many difficulties  would vanish if the militaryoperations were to again become Jess unfavourable for the Central Powers.    Dr. Nicholai, who recently escaped from Germany to Denmark in an  aeroplane,has stated  that  the  revolutionary movement in Germany is now widespread.  he considers that this might be turned to our advantage if definite terms of peace couldbe placed before the German people ; the terms to be those of the Allied. Governmentspeaking in agreement, not of individual  statesmen.   If accepted,  Germany to bereceived into the League of Nations as an equal.    Generally speaking, Germany appears  to be turning more and. more towards theLeague of Nations.  America, on the other hand, appears to be becoming more exactingin her demands, which have been voiced unofficially by Senator  bodge.    (1)  ddie Dutch Government have informed Germany that they are  satisfied, that1 he Koriiricjcu Regentes was  torpedoed, and  have asked that an  enquiry  should  be instituted.    (2)  ddie far-reaching effect in Allied countries of the coal shortage in the  UnitedKingdom  is explained in.  a  Foreign Office  Memorandum which gives the opinion ofthe French, Italian and  United States  delegates to the Allied Maritime transport council.    A note on &quot;ddie National and International Position  of Labour&quot; is of  interest.It is a precis of a memorandum drawn up by tire Political Intelligence Department ofthe Foreign Office.

PART  II.-FOREIGN  AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.    Shillings. According  to  the War Trade Intelligence  Bureau, the total tonnageof 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons  gross in  the  case of sailing-ships, reported, lost owing to the malice of the Iving&apos;s enemies during  the periodAugust 16th.-22nd  inclusive, was 63,953  tons gross, of which 23,049 were British,as compared wdth 75,016 tons gross, of which 40,208 were British, reported last week.    German  Wireless  of  August  25th  makes  the  following  claim: &quot;In  Julyaltogether  550,000  gross tons of merchant  ship  space  useful, for our enemies havebeen  destroyed.  The merchant ship space standing  at their  disposal has  beendiminished by the warlike measures alone of the Central Bowers since the beginningof the war by  about 18,800,000  gross  tons.   Of  this the losses  of the  Englishcommercial fleet  amount to about 11,600,000 tons.  According to statements whichhave been  established in the meantime, besides the losses of enemy merchant  ships or of those  sailing in  the service of our adversaries, it has been made known that about 28,000  tons have  been severely damaged by our warlike measures and broughtinto port.&quot;    Issue  of  Safe  Conducts by Germany to Neutral Vessels. The Foreign Office onAugust 2Sth informed the Danish Minister that  His Majesty&apos;s Government  was notprepared to  facilitate the  despatch by the Danish  Government to  its Minister  atMadrid of  forms of German safe-conducts.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government felt that itwould not be right to  give any countenance  to the enemy practice of granting suchsafe  conducts  to neutral vessels, as  to  do so would  imply that vessels  innocentlytrading might, unless so provided, be lawfully destroyed by a belligerent submarine.The Danish Minister has been advised that this represents the settled policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government pending the conclusion  of  a satisfactory agreement on thesubiect  in  consultation  wdth  the other Allied Governments.    The  norwegian government has asked that  Norwegian vessels sailing under  German safe-conductsmay not  be brought into a United Kingdom  port  and thus  exposed to the  risks  ofthe danger zone.  His Majesty&apos;s Government has intimated that it will  accord theordinary facilities to  such vessels  clearing immediately inward or  outward without.prejudice to  a final decision,  upon the Norwegian-German Agreement in regard  tosafe-conducts.  This  agreement has  been transmitted  to London and is now underconsideration..  German Wireless of August  24th  sets out recent sinkings  of Danishand Norwegian tonnage.   (See  Reports Nos. 80 and 82 ;  also No. 79 under  &quot;UnitedStates &quot; ; also below under &quot; Spain.&quot;)    The &quot;  Koningin Begentes.&quot; The Netherlands Foreign. Office announces that ithas informed  the German Government that the  enquiry  by the Naval Staff and theShipping Council has  established  beyond  doubt that  the  Koningin Tiegent.es was torpedoed.    The Dutch Minister  in  Berlin  has been instructed  to  request thatthe German Government should institute a serious inquiry into the question whethera German submarine is to blame for the disaster.  (And see Reports Nos. 72-74, 77,and 78.)    The  Goal Situation. A memorandum. (1.44697, dated August 23rd) by the ForeignOffice records the opinion of the French, Italian, and United States  delegates to theAllied Maritime Transport Council as to  the grave consequences to the Allied causeresulting from shortage in the British  coal  output.   These  include  (1) waste  of
shipping through vessels waiting for coal ; (2)  tonnage sent  away in ballast owing to lack of coal; (3) disturbance  of  all arrangements with neutral countries,  basis ofwhich is. provision of British coal in-return for  (a) tonnage, (b)  foodstuffs ;  (4) declinein bunker stocks of Mediterranean and. other depots, on which  the whole  movements of tonnage depend ;  (5) probability of grave coal crises in France, and as a result in italy also ; (6)  reduction of British, French, and Italian steel output;  (7)  in  order tobunker South America and supply Argentine coal needs, vessels  are now  being sent from the United Kingdom  in ballast to carry  coal from  the United  States to  SouthAmerica.   This, again, means a serious waste of shipping ; (8)  shortage of coal inthe United Kingdom, is making it necessary to draw  coal  instead  from  the UnitedStates ; apart from a prospective shortage there, this means an extremely serious  waste of shipping.  When a  vessel has to bunker in the States for a round voyage the extracoal carried shuts out at least 500 tons of cargo.   500 tons of shipping is sufficient tomaintain 100 American soldiers in France for a year.    An  increased  production  of  coal  in the  United  Kingdom is  therefore recom-mended.    Conditions in  Officers&apos; Gamp at Holzminden. Serious  complaints having beenreceived  of brutality on the part of the  German officer in charge  of the Holzmiridencamp for officer prisoners of war,  the Foreign  Office has  requested that  the Nether-lands Minister in Berlin will arrange for the immediate inspection  of  the  camp,  andfor an investigation  into the conduct of the officer in question.ALLIED  GROUP.

Jordan deprecates further representations in favour of  an indepen--dent local  settlement of the Tibetan frontier question, as being likely to  weaken theinfluences which have  guided  Chinese policy since 1914, namely, regard  for GreatBritain and uncertainty as to wdiat material support might  in the last  resort  beextended by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Tibetans, in addition to the disorderedstate of Szechuen.  lie  submits that the Frontier  Commissioner at Tachienlu wouldbe best qualified to represent China in any arrangement for&quot; a  temporary cessation ofhostilities.

Italian Wireless  ofAugust  21st  states : &quot; The  German  bulletin from Nauen  says  that  the  officialrecognition  of  the Chekho-Slovaks  has  caused  great indignation  in  Austrianpolitical and  military circles.   It  is  natural  that  this  action  should   not  leaveAustria indifferent, for she  must  understand  that it is the  first step towards thedismemberment  of her  already  threatened  unity.   Austria failing to  have otherarguments,  repeats  its  accusations  that  the  Chekho-Slovak  legions  have  been
formed by compulsion, and says that such a  scheme  is against the  law of peoples.But, on the contrary, Austria  by force  kept  back oppressed nationalities who weredesirous of freedom, while the  Chekho-Slpvaks have formed an army with enthusiasticfaith and of their own free will.   Austria tried in vain to  suffocate their sentiments,&apos;and it was she who violated the law of peoples,   ddie Austro-German Press cannotput much hope on  the  probability of Allied  misunderstandings about  the policy ofnationalities, for the recent discussion in the Italian Press on Italian policy has shownthat Italian public opinion is united as to the dismemberment of Austria, while allattempts to create scissions between Italy and the oppressed nationalities comes from enemy sources.&quot;     Italian Wireless  of August 25th  observes : &quot; Ample  discussion  on italian foreign policy, in which the whole Press has taken part, confirms the  conclusion that italian public opinion, is united regarding the necessity that Italy  should be the first to assert the policy of Austrian political  dismemberment and should  do  all it can to intensify that policy to which  all the Allied Governments have recently given loyalapproval,  ddie newspapers  say that the discussion has been useful because it mustcertainly clear away all mistakes and  uncertainties, pointing out to the Italians  thestraight way  which  they should follow  in  order to attain rapidly the  liberation ofthe nationalities oppressed by Austria, and to do so in full accord with all the Allies.&quot;The Epoca enters into the discussion of foreign policy in an important leading article which voices the opinion of the majority of the Italian people.   The  article recalls.theexplicit declaration  of the Premier  Orlando  in the Chamber  on February 12th, whenhe solemnly affirmed the rights of all the nationalities  oppressed by Austria  and alsothe necessity of completing  the national unity of Italy.   The Epoca  says that Italyand the  Government  to-day  are more  than  ever persuaded  of  the  necessity  of recognising the rights of Jugo-Slav  nationality.  (And  sec Report No. 82.)     Italian Wireless of  August 26th refers to a demonstration  held on August 25thin  Trajan&apos;s Forum in honour of the  Rumanian Irredentists.     In  a despatch dated August 11th Mr. Erskine reported  that a  crisis had duringthe previous week been  narrowly averted in connection with  Baron Sonnino&apos;s attitudetowards  the Jugo-Slav  question  (see. Reports Nos.  77 and  78).   This  arose partlythrough the efforts of Sigtior Bissolati to compel his retirement, and partly through a difference  of opinion between  him and. one of his principal critics,  Signer  Gallenga,Under Secretary of  State for  propaganda, whom he accused of carrying on an hide-pendent foreign policy ;  this difference was subsequently adjusted on the intervention of Signor Orlando.   (It is possible that, apart from the strength which Baron Sonninogives to  the Government, Signor Orlando is  glad to  have him in  the Cabinet as  acounterweight to Signor Nitti,  see Reports Nos. 49 and  79.)   It is not  clear what con-cessions, if any, were  made  by Baron Sounino,  but it is significant that. M. Pasitch,who lately passed through Rome,  was  received by him and. was   pleased  with  theresults  of his conversation.   M. Pasitch also  sent  him  a most   cordially  wordedtelegram from the front.     ddre Daily Review  (A.P.S.)  of  August 21st  reports: &quot;Efforts  are continuallymade in the Press to justify  by geography and  history the claims of  the  Jugo-Slavsand the agreement on the Adriatic.   In the Secolo of August  3rd, I. Bonomi writes  asecond article, where he sets forth Austria&apos;s present endeavour to dispose of nationalistclaims  by setting one against the other.   In the Undid (August 3rd) an  article byArcangelo Gbisleri, which appeared first  in  the Emporium,  of  Bergamo,  entitled&apos; Istria and our Eastern  Frontier.&apos;   In  this  article he claims Istria for Italy, whilst a friendly Jugo-Slav  State should  possess ports  on the  Adriatic coast,   ddie PopdloRomano  (August  9th  and lOth.) summarises Whitney  Warrens  article on Italianclaims,   ddiis work  is preceded by  a preface  by Admiral Thaon de  Revel.   The veryscholarly arguments of  W. Warren arrive at practically the same  conclusions  as  the-articles in the Unitd.  On the other  hand, the Perseveranza (August 5th, 6th and 10th)accuses  the Secolo and the Undid of  working  in the interests of the Emperor of Austria,.whose plan is  plainly to create  a  confederation of States of which the Jugo-Slavsshould form  part;  Austrian domination on the  Adriatic would then be confirmed.ddie Epoca (August  6th) refers to the visit of  Pasitch. to Sonnino whilst Orlando  was-absent in Rome.  The Epoca. considers that the incident should  be explained by theCouncil of Ministers, and recalls the &apos; clear and explicit&apos; declarations made at Parisby Orlando on the subject of Serbia and the  other oppressed,  nationalities.  In theRoma (August 5th editorial),  A.   Labriola  elaborates  the means  of  establishingamicable and   permanent  relations  between  Italy  and  Greece ;  he  recalls  pastmisunderstandings,  which Sonnino  had done nothing  to dissipate,  but remarks that
Italian policy has now entered upon  another  channel, and  Greece and  Italy are nolonger divided by opposing interests.   Though they are both Southern Powers, Italy&apos;sorientation is towards the Adriatic and  Central  Mediterranean, and  that of Greecetowards the JEgean Sea and Asia Minor.&quot;                                    JAPAN.    Position of Government.   On August 15th a deputation  of  the  Kensai-kai  partywaited on  the  Government with proposals  which, in effect, called upon the Govern-ment to resign.  Marshal Terauchi, the Prime Minister, refused to see the deputation.The belief is prevalent that  a change of Government is the remedy for the  presentdisorders of the State.    Military Co-operation with China. A  small Japanese force  is being  sent  to,Manchuria Station for the purpose of co-operating  with the Chinese troops at that place.   The  object of the expedition is to prevent any  further violation of  Chineseterritory by hostile forces.  The Japanese  Minister  for Foreign Affairs  has statedthat this Sino-Japanese co-operation, in Manchuria has no connection with the  landing of Japanese troops at Vladivostock, and that the activities of the force at  ManchuriaStation will be  confined to  driving the enemy out of Manchuria.                  v   -          UNITED  STATES.     Resumption  of  Trade  with Dutch East Indies. -Mr.  Barclay on.  August  21streported, that by arrangement between the United  States War Trade  Board and theNetherlands Charge  d&apos;Affaires  at  Washington, the  United  States would resume theordinary export trade to the Dutch Indies on the same lines  as  that  to other extra-European neutrals,  -and would import in return  tin, sugar, quinine, and  cinchonabark.   The Foreign Office pointed out  that  the  question of trade with the DutchIndies was a consideration in the.original joint negotiations for a general agreementwdth Holland, since the prora*6ing of the commodities  above mentioned was an urgentmatter for Great  Britain no less than, for  her  Allies.  His Majesty&apos;s government therefore requested,  and. has  now received,  particulars regarding  the, Agreementreferred  to.   (And see Reports  Nos. 67, 69, 70 and. 71.)     QUAY ell Machinery. The Foreign Office instructs Mr. Barclay  to urge  that inrespect of applications supported by it, priority may be granted by the United StatesGovernment for manufacture and export of oil-well  machinery, in view  of the factthat the scheme  for the re-routing of tonnage  necessitates the maintenance of theproduction of petroleum on a large scale in the East.     Attitude  and.  Tendency  of  Labour. The   following  are  extracted  fromMemorandum G.T.  5-114, of August  12th, referred to in  last wreek!s  issue  of thisReport:       &quot; The National  and,  International Position  of Labour. While the Radical andSocialist sections of  the Federation have recently been forced  more  and  more  into  aback seat by Mr. Gompers and his Conservative followers, various factors are tending to turn the policy of labour  in the direction of a Government control over businessnot far removed from the best programmes of  Socialism.  The public ownership ofall public utilities  has long  been one  of  the main planks  in  the  Federation^&apos;  platform.&apos;   Recently the  New  Jersey State Federation of Labour seems  to  have gone even  so far as to advocate Government  ownership of all  natural resources.Meanwhile  the  traditional  hostility  of  the   farmers  to   &apos; big   business  &apos;  is-coining  to  a  head  in  such  new   -movements   as  the   Non-Partisan  League.In  the  North-Western States,  as  in Western  Canada,  the  farmers   have  been pressing  for  public  ownership of  grain  elevators  and  the  like   .   .    .   .The War Labour Policies Board aims at establishing broad standards of wrages, hours,and conditions over the whole country as  a  basis for  regular periodical increases ofwages to meet  the  rise in the cost of living.   Such broad standards can easily be     8273-41)                               B
interpreted  and applied, in  detail in the case of labour directly  controlled by theGovernment itself,  through the  Conciliation  Boards  and  administrative agencies,already set up by various Government Departments.....But the means, of enforcing&apos;these standards on  privately-owned  industries, viz.,  by provisions in government contracts, and by the pressure which the War Industries  Board and tiro Railroad and fuel Administrations can exert upon recalcitrant  employers through  the refusal ofraw materials, transportation facilities and coal seem to be too drastic for actual useunless the Government is prepared  to meet a deadlock by taking over  recalcitrantindustries.  Moreover,  so  far  as  the Policies  Board has evolved  any principle  ofaction,  it is that no decision regarding  the regulation of labour shall be arrived  at between employer  and employed, but  shall be imposed by the Government as thesupreme party  to  every  dispute.   Indeed,  the report of the  Executive Council ofthe Federation  to  the  St.  Paul Convention lays  it  down  that  &apos; in war production the Government clearly occupies  the relationship  of employer,  and hence  does not constitute a third, party in interest.&apos;  In other words, employers and labour are both tobe encouraged to deal direct with the Government rather than with each other.....It would be a mistake to attempt  to deduce too much from  vague indications of thiskind, but there is some ground for believing that  the Administration at Washingtonis considering the  adoption of a new Labour policy on  a bigger scale and  on  more-radical lines than any yet contemplated, in other countries.   The development of anysuch policy must be tentative and slow, but American, public opinion is perhaps not wholly  unready for  it.   The Government  operation  of railroads, telegraphs andtelephones  has  made a great impression on  the  public mind.  The creation  of  a merchant Marine  by direct Government action  has in a way  caught Americanimagination.  Government  intervention in industries  where labour conditions  were previously chaotic, as in the  lumber industry of the north-west, has been marked byconsiderable  success.   The  GoArernment  has,  through   the  new  War  Finance-Corporation, entered upon a rather  startling course  of  direct assistance  to industry which cannot fail in the long run  to  carry with it some corresponding control......Besides the impression produced by such, concrete instances of Government action,.the British Labour  Party&apos;s programme of reconstruction has had a marked  effect on public opinion in the United States, though the Federation of  Labour  definitely rejectedit at its recent convention,  as being alien  to the non-political spirit of the Americantrade union movement ; while  the  Presidents allusions in  March  to the &apos; economic-serfdom &apos; of the working  classes seemed  to  startle  no one,  and even employersmay  be found  discussing  in  vague terms  the   &apos; abolition of  the  wage  system.&apos;One thing  seems almost certain the jusqrCau boutixme of American  labour in the-Avar, strong though it at present is, is based upon patriotism  and  upon confidence in.the President, not in any way upon cordial, relations with capital or upon abandonment of the old bitter feuds with &apos; big business.&apos;  In these circumstances, the authorities at Washington will find it necessary to maintain the Avar spirit of labour as &quot;time goes-on by an increasingly radical internal labour policy.....In view of the presentinfluence of labour in  Allied countries, the  labour policy of the United States mayhave a very marked effect on the future stages  of  the war, and on President Wilson-seventual views  as  to tire  international  peace settlement.   Already,  as regards thepeace settlement, the report of the Executive Council of  the Federation quoted aboveindicates a desire to give very definite functions in the  sphere of labour policy to  a future  League  of  Nations.  It proposes  international  action  to maintain labour-standards  in  regard to  child,  labour aud  the  basic  eight-hour  working  day, andsuggests, apparently in connection with  economic questions, that &apos; an administrativebody composed of representatives of the principal groups constituting national  interestsshould  be established (by a league  of nations) to  deal with practical problems in a.constructive way.&apos;   .  .   .  .  In  that  event a  close  understanding between the-Governments of Great; Britain and the United States in regard to labour policy in the-two countries  may  become  as  important as the understanding which  we  are nowtrying to reach  in regard to the economic and political aspects of the peace settlement.And in the sphere of labour policy, as in these other spheres, such  an  understanding-between the Governments might well supersede the far less  natural aud logical unionAvhich the  British  Labour Party  is  now  attempting  to  establish with the  socialist parties of the European Allies.&quot;     &quot;Attitude- of American Labour towards the War. The  attitude of  the AmericanFederation of Labour and the American. Alliance for Labour and Democracy towards.an Inter-Belligerent Conference  was:  reaffirmed  at  the League  to  enforce  Peace-
ENEMY  GROUP.                              AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.   -    General Conditions. According  to  information  received  by the Foreign Office,there is now complete disorder in Austria, with exaggerated prices for all commodities.There  is nobody strong enough to carry on  the  public business of the State.  Thefeeling of  attachment to the Emperor  aud Empress  is  on  the  wane,   They  are both losing ground; even  the  majorit)- of  the.  Archdukes  is  against them.  Thepresent condition of Austria is compared  to that  of  Russia three months  beforethe  Revolution:   Nothing  has been done  by the  Government to cope with  thethousands wdio have deserted during the last few  months from the Austro-HungarianArmy.  The  authorities  are either ignorant of or helpless to combat the disaffectionwhich exists among  the  troops in  A^various parts of the monarchy.  Labour appears tobe  beyond control, concessions&apos; being invariably  made  when a strike  is threatened.Ludendorff is aware of  all this, but  hesitates, in spite of criticism, to take  drastic action for fear of  precipitating&apos; a  collapse, though arrangements have  been made tomass German troops on the Austrian frontier.  The German Headcpuarters Staff have concentrated  troops in Saxony to stop any trouble which might occur  in Bohemia orGalicia.  ddie new recruits in Galicia do their training quietly, but when the period is over they refuse to enter the trains.  Bolshevism is spreading in East  Galicia.  TheGermans  are  further reported  to  be encouraging the  formation of a Polish army,possibly with the object of freeing German forces now in Poland for use in Austria ;they  have also  hinted  that in certain  eventualities   this  Polish  army  might  beemployed  to restore order in Galicia, thus holding out a bait to the Poles, who objectto  the use of Polish troops outside  the present limits  of Poland,   ddie  austrian government has exchanged troops with  the Germans, but the numbers involved arenot important.  In  this  manner Austrian soldiers are sent to the Western  front  and germans to  Italy.  This  has been done  to  produce an  impression  on  the  italian army, but the German Headquarters  Staff  insist  on  obtaining-equal numbers ofConvention at Philadelphia in May, as also at the recent Convention of the AmericanFederation  of  Labour  at  St.  Paul.   The  &apos; platform&apos;  contained the following-pronouncement :                  &quot; &apos; International Labour Conferences in War Time.    &quot; &apos; American labour favours,  and lias  always favoured, conferences with  the organised labour of all other countries in times of peace.  In times of war we oppose .conferences with the subjects of enemy countries for any purpose connected with war or peace.   In America, as in all other democracies at war, the Government speaks forthe entire nation in all negotiations  or conferences with enemy subjects or Govern-ments in relation to  foreign affairs ;  this  function furthermore belongs exclusively to each democratic Government; private conferences cannot speak  for the nation.  All-persons or groups of persons who  in open or private collusion with persons in enemy countries attempt to cause to be initiated, or  to  influence, peace negotiations or theconduct of the  war independently  of the Government  are guilty of violating thefundamental  principles of democratic Government,  based upon the consent of thepeople.&apos;     &quot; Before leaving the United States,  the American Socialist Mission, under  the leadership of Mr.  A.  M.  Simons, announced its complete opposition  to  an  inter-belligerent conference at the present moment,  but did admit that some such conference might conceivably be of value at some future date, provided that the representatives from the Central Empires were  not only in  agreement  with the aims announced  by president Wilson and by the Interallied  Labour  Conference, but were  also  actively.engaged  in  attempting  to  bring   about the   revolutionary  overthrow  of  their governments.&quot;
Austrians in return.  They  do not, expect any troubles elsewhere  in  the  DualMonarchy.  The Jugo-Slavs are badly organised, although the Czechs are  trying to repair this.   The  Poles  and the  Czechs are  working  in close collaboration,   ddiewheat crop  is worse than last  year, while the potato and  beet crops are much better.     Hunger-Sickness, in Bohemia. According to a report received, the great  increaseof hunger-sickness in  Bohemia is causing considerable friction between the Germanpopulation and the  Czechs,   ddie  latter, who  live chiefly on the land, have controlover  the food supply,  and  allow as little as possible to reach the  Germans,  amongstwhom the sickness  and mortality are  comparatively  much  greater.  The  germans have applied to the Central  Government at Vienna, which is, however, afraid of the czechs and  dares  not  take active steps in  the matter,  ddie disease is thus havingpolitical consequences.

A  fairly reliable source  reports  that  at Munich certainbanks will  not change  Austrian  crowns,  by reason of  the great depreciation of austrian currency.  (And see  Report No. 77.)                                   GERMANY.    Altitude towards the War. The Foreign Office  learns that Main Headquartersdispensed with Kiihlmann not on account of the terms of  his speech  (see reports nos. 75-77), which had  received the  approval  of Ludendorff, but  on  the  groundthat he chose the wrong  moment  for  its  delivery.  Ludendorff  is stated  to  liesincerely  depressed  at  the  failure of  the  last  German offensive  for  which  he took responsibility  against  the judgment  of  Hindenburg.  The  failure  of  theGerman  Army to reach Paris produced a tremendous  impression, even  greater thanthat produced by the  recent victories  of  the  Allies. Riihlmann  grows stronger.every day, and is on close terms of  intimacy with Erzberger.  The latter is preparing a vast  offensive against  German Headquarters  to be  commenced  on  the occasion of the  next meeting of  the  Reichstag.   Erzberger&apos;s new policy is one  of  peace.He will  propose that  Belgium  and  Lorraine  should  be  surrendered ;  that  a referendum should be taken in Alsace ;  that  the provinces  of Posen and Silesiashould  lie  ceded  to  Poland; and that East Prussia and Cohrland should be erectedinto a Baltic State.  He wdll also advocate the dismemberment  of  Austria, the annexation of her German Provinces  by  Germany,  disarmament, and  a  Christianfraternity  of  nations,   &amp;c.   German Army  Headquarters  are  opposed  to  thedismemberment of Austria, and the German Ambassador  in  Vienna, who  is a slave.of the  German Military  Authorities, is working hard against  the German elements in Austria who desire incorporation in the German Empire.    due recent agitation for a permanent session of the Reichstag results from a fear that a  military dictatorship is contemplated.  It  is  suggested that  the government might welcome a quarrel with the Reichstag as an excuse for proroguing it indefinitely.The leaders  of the  Majority Socialists are completely out  of touch with their party which is consumed with mutual distrust.     German Wireless of August 27th reports a long interview granted by the german minister of War, von Stein, to the Editor-in-Chief of  the Berliner Morgenpost relative to the  &quot;wild  rumours which have  recently  sprung  up on all sides like evil weeds &quot;regarding the military situation.

    Food Questions. -The Daily Review  (E.P.S.) of August 22nd  indicates certainpolitical and social effects of the food shortage.  Bavaria and Saxony are indignant  atthe preferential ration granted  to  Berlin; the Nuremburg Socialists  have issued amanifesto against food hoarding and illicit trading :  &quot; The effect on the strength and health of  the workers is terrible,  and tuberculosis is spreading terribly.   labour representatives have  hitherto  kept the workers from expressing their desperation,but their task is growing impossible,&quot;  Miners in Saxony have been  threatened, with&quot;military control&quot; if they strike for more food.  (And see under &quot;Austria-Hungary.&quot;)    Mitt el Fur ova. The Daily Review (Ec. Supp.)  of  August 20th reports :--&quot; DerWelthandel (July 26th) contains a notice that the inaugural meeting of the proposedGerman Economic Council for  Mittel Europa was to take  place on that date in Berlin.The programme of the Council, as announced by Wolffs Telegraphic  Bureau, is toinclude the development  of  German  economic life in  its connection with  world-economics- by the  gradual extension of German economic relations on the continent ofEurope.   Based  on a  customs  union  with  Austria-Hungary,  a  closer  economicrelationship with the East of  Europe is  to be  first established  by means of soundcommercial treaties in  order  that  by securing a supply of raw  materials, especially from  Great Russia and.  the Ukraine, Germany  may obtain the power of  compellingthe  overseas raw materials   producer to preserve an&apos; economic  peace after  thewar.    One  of  the  leading  personalities  in the  Silesian  wholesale  industry hasrecently given  his opinion of the  attitude of  Silesiau industries  to the  Mittel-Europa programme.   He  stated  that the economic  associations  representing  theinterests  of Eastern Germany do  not  consider  the  proposed  formation  of  anEconomic  Council for  Mittel  Europa  as likely  to assist&apos; the development  of  theeconomic life of Eastern Germany.   It is very doubtful if the Council will be formed,especially  as such serious  differences of opinion  are  found, to exist between thevarious economic  associations  interested  in the matter.  The inclusion of the recon-struction  of the Eastern traffic in  goods in the Mittel-Europa programme would  be tantamount  to prejudicing considerably  the  economic  interests of Germany.  TheW eser-Zeitung of July  27th  states  that  the contemplated  formation of a  german economic  Council for Mittel Europa has, as is well-known,  given rise  to fears  of adisintegration of  economic forces.   The journal is informed that  the  Central Asso-ciation of German Manufacturers  and the Federation  of Manufacturers, as  well asthose  organisations  of  trade  and industry  working  in the domain  of a  central european  economic  rapprochement,  viz., the German-Austro-Hungarian  economic association  and the Central European Economic Association, and  also the German-Russian Association, are holding aloof from the new departure.   The Imperial autho-rities, on receipt of an invitation,  have simply sent their reporters to the  statutorymeeting.&quot;  (And  see Reports  Eos.  58, 66, 68 and 82.)NEUTRAL GROUP.                           ARGENTINE  REPUBLIC.    Naval and Military Programmes. The Foreign Office learns that  some appre-hension is felt by the Brazilian Government at the report that the Argentine government proposes to spend 16 millions on naval and 10 millions on military purposes.  Owing tothe excellent relations at present existing between the Argentine and Chile, the brazilian government doubts wdrether this great increase in armaments is intended to cope with similar  additions which  are  being made by the Chilean Government, and suggeststhe possibility of  German machinations in the matter.  The Foreign  Office has intimated that His  Majesty&apos;s Government will  not permit any such armaments to besupplied from the United Kingdom during the war except to Allied States.

A report received shows that the  shipbuilding industryis expanding in Chile, two new yards being under construction in the south to buildvessels  of 5,000 tons.  A new yard at  Cavanchu, near Iquiqne, is already turning outsmall vessels.  Trade with the United Slates  is considerable ;  a new line  of steamersfrom San Francisco to the west  coast of South America is announced.   Imports ofnitrate into the Statesdiave trebled during the war, and United States exports to Chileare being increased accordingly.   Trade with  Japan  has doubled in.  the last  twoyears ; a Japanese  commercial mission is at  present studying local conditions,  ddiediscovery of a process to extract  potash from nitrate ore is of considerable interestto Chile, breaking as it does  the German  potash monopoly,  ddie  estimated  possibleoutput is 720,000 tons per year, or more  than  the total German output.  With regardto the nitrate industry, a serious view is  taken of the competition of synthetic nitrate,and a Government Commission has been  appointed to examine  the question.  Thereis, however, some evidence, of a probable German demand for Chilean nitrates after thewar, which would seem to indicate a recognition of the superiority of Chilean nitratesover the artificial nitrates produced in  Germany.   (And see Report No. 77.)                                  DENMARK.    Iceland. Mr. Cable reports that  a leading article has appeared in a Reykjaviknewspaper written by  a pro-German Icelander,  latefy returned from  Copenhagen,urging the immediate passage of the Danish-Icelandic Union Law (see Report No. 82).ddie writer contends that in view of the danger that Denmark may be involved in thewar, it  is desirable that the permanent neutrality  of  Iceland should  be speedilyproclaimed to and recognised by the belligerents.    (And see under &quot; General.&quot;)                                   FINLAND.    Finland and the North. Further information received by the Foreign  Office (see also Reports Nos. 78 and 80) confirms that the Finnish Army and people generally are entirely opposed to the Murmansk enterprise.   The Abo Underrattelser states that theFinnish Party wants territorial acquisitions,  while the Swedish Party is hostile  to this idea.   &quot;Finland might hope  for Western  European assistance  for independence within its present limits, but not for conquests effected at the  expense of a temporarilyenfeebled Russia,  ddie war will  last another two years ; hence it is futile to drag  in poor Finland with her untrained army.&quot;   The pap*er opposes  the idea of incorporatingKarelia.   &quot; Germany has no advantage in starting a  new front, and  would only  beencumbered  by  bolstering up Finland,  ddie Entente  might consider  such  actionunneutral.  Theoretically, this is true, but practically Finland cannot help Germanyusing her territory as a base.   Surely the Entente will, be content if Finland remainspassive.   France and  the United  States are undoubtedly friendly, but England isfighting for world power, and her recent Declaration recognising the Czecho-Slovaksas belligerents shows Iioav difficult her situation is when she thus raises  mercenaries.Judging by the  British note, the Entente has no desire to  declare war on Finland.Finland&apos;s best  policy  is to keep out  of the world Avar.   When  great Powers are fighting, small States, if they enter the war, probably pay expenses but do not shareprofits.&quot;  ddie Ilufvudstadbladel urges the Finnish Press to  abstain from publishingbellicose  articles regarding Murman and Eastern.  Karelia,  and advises a peaceful settlement.   Referring  to  the Declaration, of His Majesty&apos;s  Government (see  ReportNo.  81),  it declares that Finland  should  principally aim  at the maintenance of awatchful  neutrality, through which to secure  a  real  independence;  and that she should refrain from hostilities beyond  her  frontiers, provided  these are  not forcedupondier.  Finland, Germanj^,  and the  Scandinavian States  would all be best  served by leaving.Finland to collect her strength and  put her house  in order.  Finland&apos;s
participation in the war, even if she should thereby gain Eastern Karelia, would be agreat misfortune.  Great caution should  be  observed in accepting deputations fromKarelia  (see Report No.  82)  as  representative  of  the national  desire.  Peacefuldiplomacy, especially peaceful  arrangement with  Russia and the adoption of strictneutrality, is preferable to forcible military methods.     German Activities. The Foreign Office  learns  that  the Germans  are  hastilysending to Viborg or further East all the military transports captured from the Russians.They are also commandeering light steamers and motor boats, which will  be equipped with  machine  guns  and  probably employed  on  Lake Saima  or  Lake  Ladoga.Sir E. Howard  learns that  the Finnish papers have  not  been  allowed to publishparticulars of the recent Allied victories.  The  Daily  Revieio reports  : &quot; Certainincidents are reported which  throw some light on the relations between the Bolshevistsand  the  German Government.  The  Bolshevist  Minister  in  Stockholm, Vorovski,who is  now taking  part  in the peace  negotiations between Russia and Finlandwhich are being carried on  in Berlin, is reported to have said &apos; that it was natural that the  Finnish Senate should wish for friendly  relations with the Germans, whohad  helped  them to  victory over  their  internal  enemies &apos;  (Stockholm?  Tidningen,August 8th).  Even if,  as Arbetet  (August  9th)  puts  it, Lenin fomented  the RedRevolution,  and then  betrayed  it,  this  seems  rather a startling attitude,  but it isalso  reported that the  Finnish Socialists in Moscow have  warned  their  followersagainst joining  the  Entente  forces  at  Archangel, and  that  the  Red  Leaders arehoping  to  return  to  Finland  (Stockholms  Tidningen,  August  4th;  Aftonbladet,August 5th), that an  exchange of political  prisoners  between Finland  and  russia is to be  carried out through the German Consul  in Petrograd (Stockholms Dagblad,August 2nd), and that the  publication  of a  Socialist  paper is  to be  allowed  on certain conditions (Aftonbladet, August 3rd).&quot;     Constitution. According to AfiohbladeVs Helsingfors correspondent  and german wireless  of  August 24th, a deputation appointed by  the Finnish Government has left  for Berlin to take  action regarding the election  of a King.   The deputationconsists of Mr. Neyalinna,  Senator Talas,  Dr.  Frey  and Baron von Bonsdorlf.  Thecandidature of Duke Adolf Fried rich of Mecklenburg  is  considered to have the best prospect.  The Finnish News Agency announces that Senators Kallio  and Pehkoneuhave  resigned.   They belong to the Agrarian party and  are  supporters of Monarchy,but  are  stated  to  regard  the  present action  of the  Finnish  Government  asunconstitutional.

The  Foreign  Office  instructs  Sir W.Townley to  protest  strongly to the Netherlands Government  against the - recentcontinuous passage of  military  equipment over the Limburg Railways, in breach notonly of Dutch neutrality  but  also of assurances given by the Netherlands Government.(And see Reports Nos.  75 and 76.)     In reply to representations by Sir W. Townley, the Netherlands Foreign minister has  stated that  permission has  been granted  to  the German Government for thedespatch of  dredging  material  via the Rhine to  Antwerp  for work in the Scheldt,guarantees having been received that the work was of  a non-military character.  Areport received suggests  that  this material may in  reality be intended for Zeebruggeand Ostend.
    Dutch Negotiations ivith Germany and die Allies.-Siv W. Townley reports that anew Cabinet is likely to be formed within a few clays, and there is a good prospect that it will be prepared to conclude a general agreement with the Associated Govern-jnents on lines closely corresponding with the original proposals.  The Germans have become less  imperative in  their demands on the Dutch ;  they still desire hides andcattle, but it is probable that the Associated Powers will prevail on the Dutch to refuse the former  and limit the  latter, as the  Germans seem ready to accept almost any arrangement which wdll secure them food.  (And see Reports Nos. 78 and 80.)     In the circumstances  the Foreign  Office  has instructed Mr. Barclay to submit tothe United States Government the uiidesirability of  making any temporary rationing-agreement with Holland.

Belgian lielief Ship torpedoed off  Norwegian Coast. A Press message of  August21st from Stavanger reports  that the Belgian relief ship Gasconier was sunk onAugust 20th,  two miles off the island of Utsire.  This message indicates  that she was torpedoed by  a  submarine.   German Wireless of the same date quotes the NorwegianAdmiralty as  announcing that the ship was sunk off Utsire by  a mine.  SirM. Findlayreports that a Marine Court was held, and that it was not established wdiether the ship was torpedoed or mined, or whether she was in territorial -waters at the time.    German Desire for a Commercial Understanding with Norway. ddie Norwegianrepresentatives  who recently went to  Berlin  to  negotiate the  safe-conduct agreement were sounded by the Germans on the question, of  a new commercial understanding.Germany  desired to  secure  (a) 1,000 tons of  cod-liver oil, (6)  an undertaking that norway would   not  discriminate against German trade after the  war, and  (c) an assurance that  after the war Norway would allow Germany free  transit for Germangoods over Norwegian territory.   The Norwegian delegates could not agree to any ofthese proposals.  M. Ihlen has assured SirM. Findlay that the  Norwegian Governmentis strongly opposed to binding Norway by any agreement with Germany in respect of post helium trade.

Mr.  Rennie reports that  on  August  22nd a revoltwas  carried out  by about  150 men of the garrison at Ancon,  which is situated,25 miles from Lima.   A revolutionary manifesto was published by the mutineers, whoseized a  train and  proceeded  towards Huacho.    ddie Peruvian  Government hasdespatched a force in pursuit, and a cruiser to Iduacho carrying troops.   According tolater  information, the mutineers have dispersed into the interior.   On August 23rd,Congress, by a majority of 104 against- 18, voted  the  suspension of  constitutionalguarantees until October 22nd.

Attitude towards Germany regarding the Submarine Campaign. Sir A. Hardingelearns that the German Government, in discussing the Spanish Note (see Report No. 82),argued  that it could not permit minerals to  be sent to England, and that german public opinion would not tolerate the abandonment  of the submarine campaign.   Itsuggested that, if Spain would withdraw her demands, a compromise might be arrangedbased upon safe-conducts and  exemption of food ships from  attack.   The austrian government,  in  a  more  conciliatory  tone,  supported  these  contentions.   TheSpanish  Foreign Minister, however, maintained his position, offering,  if Germany
would abandon in  principle her  claim  to  sink Spanish ships,  to  allow  time forsubmarine officers to be so instructed ;  he also declined the suggestion that  paymentshould be made for torpedoed ships, insisting that the Spanish Government requiredtonnage.  The Spanish Ambassador at Berlin,  who  was  strongly pro-German, hasbeen allowed to resign.  The German Ambassador has paid a special visit to Santanderin an attempt (apparently  unsuccessful) to influence  the  Xing.  No official reply has yet (August 27th)  been recei\red  from Berlin, but the Spanish  Foreign Minister has again made it clear to the German Ambassador that he adheres to  his declaration.His colleagues, fully realising the possible  consequences of a  rupture of relations,unanimously uphold his attitude.   German plans to arouse the country  and the armyagainst the Government by a campaign in the Spanish Press have  been stultified by theapplication of the recently passed Press  Law (see Reports Nos. 76-78), but the german ambassador  will probably endeavour  to  provoke disorders,  and  is  stated to  havealreadj&apos;&apos; enlisted  with that  object  the services  of the Republican  leader  Lerroux.In particular he will aim at discrediting the Foreign Minister, especially with his ownparty. Sir A. Hardinge and the United States Ambassador have promised the ForeignMinister that Spain  Avill  receive full  support from  their  respective GoAmrnments,which will make every effort to  supply her material  requirements.   (And see under&quot; General.&quot;)                                   SWEDEN.    Swedish Breach of London Agreement. The Swedish Government  has  incurredresponsibilities towards the German  Government which involve a breach of its Agree-ment with the Associated Governments (see Reports Nos. 71-73, 78, and. 80). The swedish government made an arrangement with Germany in April last under Avhich it was toreceive 150,000  tons  of coaf monthly  in return for  25 tons of  impregnated  canvas(presumablj-  for aeroplanes), 50  tons of animal hair, 100,000 tons of wood pulp,27,690 tons of spinning paper and other  commodities. It was  also ,agreed in Aprilthat the Stora Kopparberg Birgalags Company should send 40,000 tons of pyrites toGermany  annually in  return  for  coal  and coke required  by  the Company.   TheSwedish Government  granted export  licences for the whole 40,000  tons of  pyritesAvhile M. Marcus Wallenberg was in London negotiating the Swedish Agreement withthe Associated Governments.  18,000 tons were sent, before the Allied  Swedish Agree-ment  was ratified  and  7,000  tons  \vere  exported subsequently.    The swedish government argues that the  exports in question are covered by notes exchanged  whenthe  Allied-Swedish Agreement was signed to the effect that  certain  export  licencesalready  granted to  Germany in  return  for compensation goods  should  not be cancelled.  M. Wallenberg, who is chairman of the Kopparberg Company, has assuredSir E.  Howard  that  he  was not informed of the  rmoposed exports of pyrites toGermany, and. that on. hearing of the  matter he advised the Swedish Government to suspend any  further deliveries.   Sir  E. Howard is  not inclined to  believe that theSwedish Government have  acted  in  bad faith, but  he held out  no hope  that HisMajesty&apos;s  Government would sanction  any exports  to  Germany in breach of theAllied-Swedish Agreement.   The Allied Ministers have made strong representations to the Swedish Government in the matter ; and  have  submitted  to  their Governmentssuggestions for a collective Note, which, while not tending  toward the  abandonment of  the  Agreement, might   indicate that similar infractions cannot  in future be disregarded.                                SWITZERLAND.     The Olten Soviet. In a despatch  dated  July 31st, Sir H. Rumbold reports thatthe Socialist Committee of Olten  (see Report No. 82)  decided  on  July 20th to summon a  Socialist and Labour Congress  at Bale, Avhich assembled on the  28th.  &quot; The OltenCommittee, sitting at a great labour  and raibvay centre, has  arrogated to itself on recent occasions the  character and  functions of a SoAdet; this Bolshevist  imitationbeing the more pronounced owing to the fact that the  principal spokesman  andorganiser of disturbance is Herr Grimm, the  notorious friend of pro-German Russiandemocracy.   It is noteworthy that  the Olten  Committee  has adopted  the course inrecent instances of negotiating with the  Federal Council  by Avay of ultimatum, thusdiscarding the more common forms of  petition, referendum, or parliamentary motion.It Avill be remembered that the ultimatum on the subject of civilian mobilisation was accepted by the Government, Avhile that concerning the price of milk Avas referred tothe Chambers, who adopted a compromise (see Reports Nos. 67 and 68).  The  present     6273-4!)                            n
 ultimatum concerned, among other things, the desired revocation by the Federal Council of  its decree of July 12th  relative to the prevention  of  disorder in  the cantons. But its importance, as well as that of the  Congress of Bale, lay in the fact that the railway employees to the number  of  18,0,00, and the postal,  telegraph,  and customs officials, numbering in all 60,000,  announced their solidarity with the Labour Union in  demanding an increase of wages owing to the rise  in  prices, shorter  hours, &amp;c. The gravity of the crisis which had suddenly arisen through the reinforcement of the labour movement by the accession of the countless  State  employees to their ranks, wdiose original grievances had not met with  a  sympathetic hearing,  may be judged by the situation  which  would be created  if all railway traffic were  suspended, all foreign coal and flour  were stopped at the German  and French frontiers, and all home-grown produce such as milk were to cease to reach the consumer in. Switzerland. The  more pessimistic organs  of the Press pointed, out that, at a moment when the military forces on the frontiers were  seriously weakened by the epidemic of influenza, only a general strike would be required to bring about an invasion....... The  decision finally reached by the  Bale Congress, however, represented  a triumph of  the more moderate elements in consequence  of  the refusal  of the  Federal employees to rally to the proposal for the proclamation of an immediate general strike. ddie latter declined to go beyond the adoption of the principle of a strike,  which was consequently negatively adopted by the rejection by .177 votes to 79 of the proposal for an immediate strike.  A  Syndicalist motion  was  adopted, on  the other  hand, demanding the universal recognition in Switzerland of  the  eight-hours&apos; day.  In spite of  this respite, the  situation remains disquieting, if  it is no longer alarming.&quot;   It is  evident  that  both the Government and  the Syndicalists are held back  by the fear of  foreign complications from pressing the crisis to danger point.  The conversations between the Olten Committee and the Government will  now  presumably be resumed, - and the Syndicalist coalition will  have strengthened  its hand, by the reality, not  the threat, of the adoption of the principle of the  general strike.&quot;     Extracts quoted  by the Daily Review (N.P.S.) of  August 23rd from, the Swiss Press indicate that the  present success is regarded, by the Socialists as only &quot; a little episode,&quot; and that &quot; the struggle for the cause of the proletariat must be continued. with  redoubled energy.&quot;  It  is also intimated  that certain  leaders of the Socialist Party are not so  much, concerned for the welfare of  the workers as simply to  stir up a revolutionary action in accordance with the Stockholm programme.  (And see Report No. 74.)     Germany and the  Swiss  Press. - Sir 11. Rumbold reports that the  Neue  Freie Zeitung, the only democratic German newspaper appearing in Switzerland, was recently notified by the Federal.  Government (on  the suggestion  of  M. Schultess) that  it must be  suspended  for the  rest of the year for having exceeded its paper ration.   The Swiss  Minister  at Washington  thereupon represented strongly to M. Schultess the unfortunate effect which such action was likely to  produce upon  opinion  in the United States  and  elsewhere,  and pointed out the  unwisdom of  alienating  the Americans,  upon whom  Switzerland  so  largely  depended  lor  its  food  supply.* Mr.  Schultess  has  consequently  arranged  to  substitute a fine for  the notice of suspension.      On August 21st the Federal Council issued a communique denying that political motives played any part, or that Germany had taken any steps, in the matter.      The Natio7ic.d-Zei.tung (August 8th)  quotes the following from. Le Democrate :  &quot;It  is generally known that some  influential.  Germans,  supposedly through  the medium of  Colonel Egli, have recently acquired the Zarcher Morgen-zeitung.  There is now a rumour that German propaganda is  about to take  a yet more important  step, nothing less than the purchase of a paper of  good standing in Northern Switzerland. It is said  that most of the shares are already  in German hands, and that several of the editorial staff are contemplating resigning.&quot;      Ex-T ing Constant ine&apos;s Entourage. Sir Id. Rumbold  reports that in  the absence of concrete  evidence against MM. Streit, Theotokis or Paparigopoulos,  the Federal Government is unlikely to acquiesce in  any  representations  for their expulsion made on the instructions  of the Greek  Government.   Opinions recently expressed by M. Streit  to  a  Hungarian interviewer  would  not be considered  by the  Swiss as forfeiting his right of asylum.  \See Reports Nos. 50, 61, and 82.)
PEACE DISCUSSIONS.     As usual, such peace discussions as there are continue to follow very closely the trend.of military operations.     Central Towers. -The  Pan-German  slide  is  fading  away  and  the  Leagueof  Nations is appearing more  clearly on  the screen.   But it is to be  a League ofNations  on a German model, which will allow the German  people to pursue without.any restrictions those aims of economic world domination which can only be attained.by  the laborious methods of peace instead of by the short cut of war.     Nevertheless, the less aggressive spirit which was  manifest in  Dr. Solf s speech and in other quarters is not yet  universal, and the Colonial Secretary has come  in fora good deal of hostile criticism.  The Pan-German, slide has not been  broken up ; itis only put away ready to reappear should  the military operations take a turn for the better.     The Deutsche Tageszeitung accuses Dr. Solf of betraying a great part of thepeople  and describes his speech as &quot;oozing morality&quot; and his references of theLeague of Nations as &quot; beckoning across the ocean.&quot;     The Leipsiger Neueste Nachriehten complains-that his declarations about Belgiumwill produce an impression of weakness and that  he has again &quot;opened the door to allkinds of misunderstandings.&quot;     Again the  Deutsche Tageszeitung, in discussing Lord Robert CeciLs speech inreply to Dr. Solf, absolutely denies that there is any weakening.  &quot; We wdll not allowour world-political right to freedom to be restricted either now or at any future  time.&quot;Further, &quot; If politics were  really conducted in accordance with civilised principles,Great Britain would  not have  a single colony in her own  possession, neither  India,Egypt,  South.  Africa,  Australia,   &amp;c,  not even  Ireland.   Everywhere  murder,destruction, poisoning by strong alcohol  and opium, robbery and impoverishment have been the principles of British domination, of their conquests and maintenance.&quot;   -  For Dr. Sclfs views on Colonial policy,  see Part I.  of this Report, page 6.     Altogether these discussions do not bring us any nearer to agreement.     Denmark. Sir Ralph Paget reports two interviews which, members of his staifhave had  with Dr. Nicholai, the German internationalist, who recently escaped fromGermany in an  aeroplane to avoid  prosecution for having published Die  Psychologicales Krieges without the  leave of the German military authorities.     He expressed the opinion,  that the revolutionary  movement in Germany  is now very widespread, but leaderless.  He summed up the views of the mass as &quot; We hateour militarists,  but since the Entente intend to  destroy us  as  a nation, and for ever,by  denying us our power to work, to  whom are we to turn except to these samemilitarists, who at any rate know their hateful  business&apos;? &quot;  His own idea as to themost hopeful method of  approaching the problem is that the Entente should frame itsown peace terms, which shotdd  then he put forward as the considered views  of  theAllied Governments, not as those of individual statesmen.  &quot;These are our terms,   ffyou accept we  guarantee that you will  be accepted in  the League  of  Nations as an-equal, and will  be treated as an equal in all matters concerning food, and raw materials.If you refuse we will crush you  off the map.   Choose.&quot;     If such terms as  these were  openly offered and  refused, revolution would break out.     Dr. Nicholahs policy therefore consists in        (1) The  alternatives must be placed clearly before the German people.       (2) The  Allies must speak with one voice.     At the same time Dr. Nicholai hardly appears to realise        (1) The distrust wdth which the present German Government is regarded in all           . . Allied countries.       (2) The  difficulty of placing any  views before the German people.     United States. In strong contrast to Dr. Nicholai&apos;s  policy is a  speech made bySenator Lodge in support of  the Man-Power Bill.  After declaring  that  peace mustbe  dictated, not negotiated, and outlining its terms, he ended wdth the words : &quot; As
this war is utterly different from any war that the world has ever knownvj;p mustthe peace, which concludes it, be utterly different from any peace that the world has ever known.   It cannot be a peace of bargain, or of give-and-take  and arrangement.Our sole purpose is to put Germany finally and completely in a position in which she can never again attempt to conquer and ruin the world.  We shall do it, but we mtfetbe above all  propositions  for bargained peace-deaf  alike to  the whimper  of thepacifist and the wheedling or truculent appeals of the helpers of Germany.&quot;    Finland. The Times (August  28tb) publishes  a telegram from Stockholm statingthat the peace negotiations at Berlin between Finland  and Russia have  been broken off, owing to differences of opinion over cprestions of expenses and indemnities.    Greece. Commenting upon a recent article in  the Manchester  Guardian dealingwith the question of a separate peace with Bulgaria, the llestia writes : &quot; Bulgaria cangain  nothing by a. separate peace as long  as the Entente  refuses to recognise herclaim to the Dobrudja,-or to Serbian territories, or  to  Eastern Macedonia, which was handed over to her, thanks to the treachery of German agents,&quot;  and concludes, &quot; forthe British Bulgarophils must not  forget that if the Germans are rightly regarded  aswolves  iii  the  eyes  of the Western  democracies,  the  wolves  in our  case are the-Bulgarians.&quot;  ddiis article appears in greater length in the Daily Review of the Foreignl&apos;ress of August 21th.    Russia. German Wireless  of August 27th reports that at  a  plenary  sittingof the Ukrainian and Russian peace conference on. the  26th  a conflict  arose  owing-to the situation caused by  the Declaration of Independence by the  Ukraine. TheUkraine will only negotiate with Russia concerning  the northern boundary.  TheSoviet Republic  demands to  be recognised as the representative of Great Russia.Both sides  wish to break off the negotiations at once,  and both  refuse  to  formulatetheir standpoint in writing.    Russian Wireless oPAugust 27th reports that Tchitcherin has sent four notes  tothe German Consul-General :     (1) A protest against the negotiations which the German Government has started           with,  the  Duke of Leuchtenberg, the representative of  the &quot; Independent           Republic of  the Don,&quot; and the German support to the Don &quot; mutineers.&quot;    (2) A protest against the negotiations between  the German Government and the-           representative of the so-called Crimean Government.    (3) A protest against German soldiers passing  over the boundary line.    (4) A protest against discussion at the Mariiwhamn Conference of the fate  of           Russian military and naval forces left on the  Aland Islands.    Sweden. German  Wireless   of  August  27th reports   that  since  the 21stnegotiations  have been taking &quot;place  in  Marihamn, between  Sweden,  Finland andGermany, with regard to the demolition of the Aland fortifications, during which the negotiators visited the fortified  places.   The negotiations will lie continued to-day  in stockholm.    Switzerland. Sir Horace  Rumbold reports   on  August  21st  that  bis  Dutchcolleague informs him that the Germans at Berne make no secret,  of their ardent desire for peace and that they are ready to make great sacrifices. &quot; Sir H. Rumbold believes that this is a genuine expression of  their views and that the members of the GermanDegation are profoundly depressed.    Turkey. Turkish  agents  are  said to be approaching Greek  representatives  in-neutral countries.
