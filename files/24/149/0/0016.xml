PEACH DISCUSSIONS (page 15).    Interest  centres in President  Wilsoibs reply of October 23rd (see under UnitedSlates) to the latest German appeal for an armistice.  The reply  provides for the submission of proposed terms by the military advisers  of the Associated&apos;Powers totheir Governments, &quot;provided they deem such an armistice possible from a military point of view.&quot;    The Germans seem to be more anxious to keep Turkey in the war than Austria-Hungary, and a  strong bid  is  being made to  prevent a  renewed  rapprochementbetween the Entente and Rumania.

PART  II.--FOREIGN  AND GENERAL.GENERAL.    Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnage of500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships,reported lost owing  to the  malice  of  the  King&apos;s  enemies  during  the  periodOctober  11-1 Sth inclusive, was 22,027 tons gross, of which 10,021 were British, ascompared with 47,886 tons gross, of which  16,244 were British, reported last week.    Devastation. The  Foreign Office  learns  that  the  German  Government  hasrequested the  Swiss   Government  to  inform  President  Wilson that a  neutralCommission  has been  formed to enquire  into  the truth of the alleged devastationbehind the lines ; the Commission, wdiich has already  begun its  investigations, consists of two  Dutchmen, two  Spaniards, one Fleming and one Norwegian.   (According toa Press  report the members of the Commission are the Spanish Minister (the Marquisde Villalobar), the  Dutch Minister (M. van Vollenhoven), the  Dutch delegate to theBelgian  Relief  Commission (M. Langenberg),   M.  van  Bree  (Belgium),  and theMarquis de  Faura (First Secretary of the Spanish  Legation).)  It is noticed thatthe notorious Baron von Lancken presides,  and that there  is1 no representativeof Switzerland, which, in the opinion of a member of  the Federal Government, is nowout of favour with Germany.  It may be expected that the findings of the commission will be altogether favourable to Germany.    Refugees and the  Dutch  Frontier. The Foreign Office  is informed  that  theBelgian  Government  has now requested  the  Netherlands  Government to permitBelgian refugees to pass the frontier into Holland, and that the French Governmentis refraining from any protest against the admission of French  refugees into Holland.ddie Netherlands Government has offered to provide railway facilities if so requested by the French and Belgian  Governments.   The German Government has undertaken to raise  no obstacles to this.   (And see Report No. 90.)    Turkey and the Berne Agreement.-A. Memorandum (G.T.  5990,  dated September12th) by Lord  Newton summarises the position with regard  to  the  exchange ofprisoners of war wdth Turkey.   The Berne  Agreement of December  1917, providing,inter alia, for the exchange of civilians and of all invalid combatants, was not evenratified  by the Ottoman Government  until the end of April 1918, since which date  ithas been found impossible, in spite of every effort, to secure the carrying out of its provisions.   There  is  good reason to believe that the obstruction  is largely due toEnver Pasha, acting under German encouragement.    On October 19th the Foreign Office instructed. Sir W. Townley  to  convey to theNetherlands Minister in Constantinople, through his Government, authority, subjectto his discretion, to  warn, the Ottoman Government that, should the Berne Agreementnot be carried out, His Majesty&apos;s Government would  not fail to bring to account theauthorities responsible.    Dutch  Transport  Service. On  October 7th Mr.  Robertson reported  that theDutch  shipping companies, through the  Netherlands  Government,  had intimatedtheir intention of suspending from the end  of October  until the  middle of  February1919  the service of transports carrying prisoners for  internment  and repatriation.The Foreign Office on October 12th  instructed Mr.  Robertson to impress  upon theNetherlands Government the moral and  legal obligation  of continuing this servicethroughout  the winter.
    Ill-treatment of British Prisoners. His  Majesty&apos;s  Government,  has  receivedfurther reports of, and has  made  further protests  regarding, grave  ill-treatment ofBritish prisoners by the Germans.     Franco-German Agreement. Sir H. Rumbold  reports that  the operation of the franco-German Agreement was  resumed  on  October  loth,  at  the rate of  twocontingents of soldiers and one of: civilians per week  in each direction.  (And seeReport No. 90.) &apos;ALLIED  GROUP.                                   BELGIUM.    British Congratulations to Belgian Government. Sir F. Villiers on  October 19thconveyed to the Belgian Government  the  congratulations of the War Cabinet &quot;onthe recent important success achieved by the Belgian and other Allied forces underthe command of His Majesty the King of the Belgians in&quot;Flanders.&quot;    Reported   impending  Release  of  Imprisoned  Belgians.   On  October  20thSir W. Townley reported  that, according  to a statement made by  Von Lancken toCardinal Mercier in  the  name  of  the German  Government,  all  Belgian  political prisoners in Belgium or Germany and deported Belgians would be liberated as soon asthe territories  were evacuated.   The liberation  of  prisoners in  occupied  Belgiumoutside military areas would begin on October 21st.    (And see under &quot; General.&quot;)                                    BRAZIL.    Question of Economic  Co-operation tuitli  the Allies. Mr.  Barclay reports  that discussions at Washington have led to  a proposal that the Associated governments should present to the Brazilian Government an identic Note offering (1) adAnrnces tomeet the exterior obligations of Brazil maturing during the next 12 months, (2) thecontinued purchase of coffee, manganese, and  rubber  on a large scale, (3) a loan bythe United States Government for the purposes of the Brazilian Navy, (4) Avithdrawalof the published Black Lists.  In return for such assistance, Brazil would be expected(1) to agree to a scheme for  the prompt liquidation of enemy interests, (2) to place theremaining  German interned ships  under  charter  to the Associated  Governments,(3) to  co-operate more closely in postal censorship.   The Foreign  Office instructsMr. Barclay that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be  prepared,  to participate to  theextent of  half  the  loan  first  above mentioned,  secured  upon the  said  purchases.Further,  the British  Trade  Corporation  would join with the American War finance corporation to the extent  of 5O0,000L in the  purchase of liquidated German Banks.British participation would be reduced to the extent of any French or  Italian contri-bution.  Mr. Barclay reports that a separate  ^preliminary  request is being made tothe Brazilian Government to declare its  attitude with  regard to liquidation  of enemyinterests.   (And see Reports Nos&apos;. 69, 71, 75, 79, S4-86, 88, and 89.)    Spanish Influenza. Sir A. Peel reported  on October 17th that business had been almost entirely suspended at Rio  de Janeiro on account of Spanish  influenza, whichhad attacked nearly half the residents.    Jews and  the Egyptian Expeditionary Force: Sir A. Peel reports that a numberof Orthodox Jewdsh natives  of Palestine have enquired of His Majesty&apos;s Acting Consulat Sao Paulo whether they may be sent  back to their  country to serve under general allenby.
     Defects of the Present Government. At a  meeting of Allied Ministers convenedon October 18th by Sir J. Jordan-, the United States Minister cited numerous instancesin which  the&apos;  Chinese Government had  fallen  short of its duty as an Allied Power,and  it was decided to make united representations to the new President regardingoutstanding&apos; cases.   It was remarked that the Military Government in Peking hadsimply exploited its status as an Ally for preserving itself in power.  Several presentconsidered that a Government more representative of China was desirable,  and thatremonstrances might be  wasted upon the existing administration.     Javanese FinancidhAssistan.ee. The Foreign  Office learns  that  the JapaneseGovernment  has offered to remit to China  the  whole  of  the  Japanese portion, ofthe 1901 indemnity ; the time and method  of return are not yet settled.  The ChineseVice-Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs has  informed  Sir J. Jordan that  he expectsconditions wdll be attached to this offer, and that its acceptance will depend ou their nature.   Sir  J.  Jordan  reports that a  further large  advance  has  recently beenmade by Japan upon the  Military  Loan, ostensibly for the  Siberian Expedition,but no  doubt calculated to  strengthen  the  hands of Tuan Chi  Jui, who is statedto be raising additional troops.   Sir C.  Greene  has -pointed  out to  the JapaneseForeign Minister that the maintenance of Tuan Chi Jui  in the Chinese Government,as giving him control over the Northern Forces, is  likely to keep alive the suspicionsof the South.   (And see Reports Nos. 69-73, 77,  81-  and 85&apos;; also  83, 87 and 88 under&quot;Japan.&quot;)     United Stales Scheme for Joint Loan to China. Mr. Barclay transmits a scheme proposed  by the United States Government to the British, French  and JapaneseGovernments  for a joint loan to  China.   The United States Government regards its general terms as fundamental both to the future peace and. welfare  of  China andto the relations between the four Powers in that country.     Bolshevism. Sir J.  Jordan reports that  the Chinese Government has instructed the Governor of the Chinese provinces adjoining Turkestan to  refuse recognition toany diplomatic representatives appointed by the Central Soviet Government.     Russian  Wireless of October 18th  reports: &quot;The Couucihs  authorities  haveissued the first number of a Communist paper.in  the Chinese  language for Chineseworkmen.&quot;                          CZECHO-SLOVAK  NATION.     Declaration  of  Independence. The  Press (see  The Times of October 21 st atpage 10) reports that the  Czecho-Slovak Provisional Government, whose  seat is inParis, has issued a declaration of independence, in which it says :  &quot; We the Czecho-Slovak National Council, recognised by the Allied and American Governments as theProvisional Government of  the Czecho-Slovak State and  nation  in complete accord with the declaration of the Czech Deputies made  in Prague  on January  6th, 1918,realising that federalisation, and still more autononry, mean nothing under a Hapsburgdynasty, hereby make this  our declaration of independence: Because of  our belief that no joeople should be forced to live under a sovereignty it does not recognise,  and because of  our  knowledge and firm conviction  that our nation cannot freely develop in a  Hapsburg Confederation,  which is  only  a  new  form  of  the  denationalisingoppression under which we have suffered  for the past 300 years, we consider freedom to be the first  pre-recpiisite for federaiisation  and believe that  the  free  nations of central and Eastern Europe may easily federate should, they  find it  necessary.  we make this declaration on the  basis of our historic aud natural right.  We have been an independent State  since the seventh century,  and  in 1526 as an independent State,consisting of Bohemia, Moravia, and  Silesia, we joined with Austria and Hungary ina defensive union against the Turkish clanger.  We have never voluntarily surrenderedour rights as an independent State in this  confederation.   The  Hapsburgs broke theircompact with  our  nation  by illegally transgressing our  rights and violating theconstitution of  our State,  which they  had pledged themselves to uphold, and we
&quot;therefore refuse  any longer  to  remain a part of Austria-Hungary in any form.  Weclaim the right of Bohemia to be reunited with her Slovak brethren of Slovakia whichonce formed part of our national State, but later was torn from our national body, and50 years ago was incorporated in the Hungarian State of the Magyars, who by theirunspeakable violence and ruthless oppression of their subject races have lost all moral and human right to rule anybody but themselves.  We cannot and will, not continueto live  under  the direct or indirect  rule  of the violators of Belgium, France, and-Serbia,  the would-be  murderers of Russia and  Rumania, the murderers of tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers of  our blood,  and the  accomplices in numberlessunspeakable crimes committed in  this war against humanity by the two  degenerateand irresponsible dynasties of Haps burgs and. Hohenzollerns.  We will not remain apart of  a State which has no justification for existence, and which, refusing to-acceptthe fundamental  principles  of  modern  organisation,  remains only  an artificial andimmoral political structure, hindering every movement towards democratic and  socialprogress.  The Hapsburg dynasty, weighed clown by a huge inheritance of error  andcrime, is a perpetual menace to the peace of the world, and  we  deem it our  dutytowards humanity and civilisation to aid in bringing about its-downfall and destruction.We hereby declare the Hapsburg dynasty unworthy of leading our nation, and  denyall of its claims to rule in the  Ozecho-Slovak land, which we here  and  now declareshall henceforth be a free and independent people and nation.   We accept and  shalladhere  to the ideals of modern democracy as they have been the  ideals of our nationfor centuries.   We shall  outline only  the main principles of the constitution of the czecho-Slovak nation. The final  decision as to  the Constitution itself falls to thelegally  chosen.representatives of the liberated and united people.  The Czecho-SlovakState shall be, a  Republic, in  constant endeavour for  progress.  It will guaranteecomplete freedom of conscience, religion and science, literature and art, speech, thePress, and the right of assembly and petition. The Church shall  be separated fromthe State.   Our democracy shall rest on. &quot;universal suffrage ; women shall be placed onan equal footing  with her men politically, socially, and. culturally ; the rights of the minorities shall be safeguarded  by proportional  representation.   National minoritiesshall  enjoy equal rights.   The  government  shall be parliamentary in form, and shallrecognise the  principles  of initiative  and referendum.   The  standing army will bereplaced,  by militia.   The Czecho-Slovak nation  will carry out far-reaching social andeconomic reforms.  dTie large estates will be  redeemed for home colonisation ; privilegesof nobility wdll be abolished.  Our nation will assume its part of the Austro-Hungarianpre-war Public Debt.   The debts for this war we leave  to those who incurred them.In its foreign policy the Czecho-Slozak nation will accept its full share of responsibility in the reorganisation of Eastern Europe.     &quot; Given in Paris, on  the 18th day of October 1918.                 &quot; (Signed)     PROFESSOR  &quot;THOMAS G.

EDWARD BENES,                                   &quot; Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Interior.&quot;     In reply to a letter from M. Benes, announcing that  the National Council  of the-Czech countries had formed itself into a Government, M. Pichon, the  Foreign Minister,unreservedly recognises the official existence of the new Government in the name ofthe French Republic,  and adds an expression of his profound satisfaction.     The Czecho-Slovak Ministry has accredited  the following representatives  to theAllied  Powers: Dr.  Stephan  Osusky,  Great Britain;  Dr. Leo  Sychrava,  France;Dr. Leo Borsky,  Italy ; Dr. Charles Pergler, United States.  Bohdan Pavlo  has beenappointed to represent the Czecho-Slovak Government in Russia.     Appreciation  of  Allied  Recognition. Mr.  Alston  communicates  a  message,received from Ekaterinburg, stating  that  the Russian  branch of the Czecho-SlovakNational Council and the entire Czecho-Slovak army fighting in Russia welcome the recognition by  the  British and Allied Governments of their  independence ; theyaffirm the whole-hearted  determination  of the Czecho-Slovak  nation to deliver itselffrom German oppression, to stand beside the Allies in  the fight for truth and right,--and never to forget those who gave assistance in  time of trouble.0603--ib
                                    JAPAN.    Siberian Policy. A Memorandum (G.T. 603.1,  dated  October 15th) by the P.I.D..examines the motives  and methods of Japanese intervention in Siberia,    Commercial Penetration in South America. According to German Press reports,.Japanese trade with the South American  States has  developed to a remarkable degree-since the outbreak of  Avar, both as regards imports and exports.  Under  the former-head, the  most striking increase occurred in  the  case of  Chile, the imports fromwhich country had  increased from 260,700Z, in 1914 to 609,1001, in  1916.   Exportsto Chile also increased  from 6,300Z. to 92,7 007, in  the  same period.  &quot; The largestimporter of Japanese wares in South  America is  Argentina:  the  value of goods.exported to that country rose from 3O,8O0Z. in 1914 to 130,100Z. in 1916.  Exports toPeru also increased from 13,700Z. in 1914 to over 50,O00Z. in 1910.  Although thegrowth  of these figures  is partly accounted  for by rising  of prices, a considerable-increase in the volume of trade is nevertheless apparent.    (And see under &quot; China.&quot;)                                   PORTUGAL.-    Influenza.- Sir L. Carnegie reports an increase of pneumonic influenza throughoutPortugal, especially in Lisbon and. the neighbourhood, where there have  been manydeaths.                       UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.    Earthcpiahe in Porto Rico. Mr. Elphick  reports that  a serious earthquake has-occurred in Porto Rico, leaving many persons homeless  and destitute.   The FrenchColony, which is more numerous and wealthy than the British, is raising a considerablesubscription and  applying to the French Government for a contribution.  Mr. Elphickenquires as to the  desirability of making  a contribution on behalf of His majesty&apos;s government.  -  (And see under &quot; brazil.&quot;)ENEMY  GROUP.                               AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.      Federation Proposals : Social  Aspect of National Disruption. A Vienna  Press-  telegram announces the publication on October .17th of an Imperial  Manifesto, dated  October  16th, announcing that, in accordance with the will  of the people, Austria  will become a Federal.  State in which each  race  is to form  its own national  State.  There will be an Empire of Bohemia, an  Empire  of  Idalicz (Ukrainia and Eastern  Galicia), an Empire of lllyria (South Slav States), and an Empire of Austria.  TVieste-  will become an  Imperial harbour.  German  Bohemia and German Silesia will be  incorporated in  German Austria.   A solution  of  the Polish  question  will not be.  reached  for the  moment, and-the  integrity of Hungary will not  be violated.  Until  the contemplated new  States are formed,.the Central-Government will  have the task  of continuing legislation and promoting the conversion of  the former imperial  States-  into Federal ones.   Commissions will he established to define  territorial boundaries.  The  National. Assemblies will. send delegates to the Federal  Assembly, which will
 represent  common  interests,  e.g.,  political,  commercial,  customs,   economic  and military.   German Wireless adds that these States are to have one State Ruler, one representation abroad, and one defence.   It quotes the Berliner Tageblatt as expecting&apos;c! the approval  of the  Washington  Government  to this settlement of the  Austrian problem of nationalities &quot; (but see various versions in DM. of October I9th and 21st). The Press states that Czechs and South  Slavs  refused to consider this solution, the Ukrainians reserved their decision aud the Poles were not consulted.  The leaders of the German National Party determined to enter into  alliance with the other German parties.   Sir  W. Townley learns that Austrian official circles are hoping that the threat of the German-Austriaas to  unite with the German Empire may induce the Slavs to modify their attitude.     A memorandum. (G.T. 0011, dated. October 15th) by the P.I.D. observes that the withdrawal of the  Czech, Jugo-Slav,  Polish, and  Ukrainian members of  the Vienna Reichsrat into Constituent Assemblies of  their own implies, if true, that the Reichsrat has  ceased to exdst, and  with it the Austrian Government as such.  The Austrian- Germans, seeing that they will no longer  be able to dominate  Austria, have therefore joined the Austrian-German Socialists in the  demand for &quot; self-determination of the Austrian-Germans,&quot; realising that, if all  the German  districts are withheld  from the new Czecho-Slovak State, the most vital strategic and economic interests of.  that  State are  jeopardised.   For the  present  the  Vienna  Government  will probably  let the different  Constituent Assemblies develop,  and the  different  nationalities  start- an internecine war, meanwhile feigning death, or rather the solicitude of  the benevolent peace-maker.   But  national questions in Austria  are  so much bound up with social contrasts, that the various national  struggles  must  unavoidably within the shortest time change into social class warfare, which, will in certain parts of the Monarchy be no less violent and bitter than in Russia.   All depends upon, whether the Army units will let themselves be  used in the repression of the nationalities opposed to them- selves or will march home and participate in their  own revolutions.     Hungary. Budapest Press  telegrams state  that  at  the  commencement of the sitting  of  the Lower House  of the Hungarian  Diet the Premier,  Dr. Welcerle, spoke. .interruptions from  Count Karolyis Party,  such  as &quot;Long live an autonomous and independent Hungary ! &quot; were frequent.  The Premier said : &quot; I desire to inform the House that the Government has tendered  its resignation to His Majesty.  He, however, has  not accepted it.&quot;     The Premier then referred to. the settlement of relations with Austria, and added : &quot; After Austria has organised herself on a federal basis, we  shall take our stand on the  basis  of personal union, and will accordingly organise our policy in an  economic respect and in relation to our defence, independence, and autonomy.&quot;     Discussing the nationalities  question, Count  Tisza said they must all endeavour to show that it was false  to  assert that the  Hungarian minority tyrannised over the nationalities comprising  the  majority.   &apos;&apos; We  will exclude Croatia.  The Hungarian law  has also recognised the Croatian nation  as  a political entity.   As regards  relative numbers,  those  of  the Hungarian   race  are decidedly in the majority.   With the Germans residing here, who politically have  identified themselves with us, we form. numerically about  two-thirds  of the  entire  population.  From, the point of  view  of economic and cultural importance the percentage is  still higher.  Moreover; a large part of the population which does not speak the  Hungarian tongue is  loyally  devoted to the  principle of a Hungarian National  State, and only  a vanishing minority  is opposed to this fundamental idea.&quot;     The  Deputy, M. Oseinae, protested against Flume being incorporated in Croatia or in an autonomous Slav State, and read a  declaration wdiich stated that the  town of Flume  desired  to claim  the right  of self-determination.  Dr. Wekerle replied that Hungary  maintained  the right  that Fiume  should  remain  bound  to Hungary  as autonomous territory, and that access to the town of  Fiume should, be safeguarded under all circumstances.   With regard to Dalmatia, the Premier stated that  it would be united with Croatia and Slavonia.  With regard to Bosnia, he took the  standpoint that Bosnia must decide whether  it desired  union  wdth Hungary or with  Croatia, within the framework of the lands of the  Hungarian Crown.     The  Deputy, Alexander Vajda  (Humane)-, read a declaration by the Executive Committee of the National Party of  Hungarian Rumanes which stated  that Hungarian Rumanes did not recognise the right of the  Hungarian Parliament and the Hungarian Government to regard themselves as the  representatives of the Rumanian  nation and take charge of the interests of the Hungarian Rumanes.
                                        S    Dr. YVekerle protested against M. Vajda speaking as the representative OF all the hungarian Ruman.es, adding :  &quot; i am convinced that, if it  is asked, the Rumanianpeople will he of quite another opinion, and will profess its allegiance to the HungarianState.&quot;                                       &apos;                                   -    German Wireless of October 20th reports (from Budapesth) the introduction byCount Karolyi of a Bill for the separation of  Hungary from Austria in the domains ofeconomic, military and foreign policy..    The Jugo-Slav Question. According  to a Press report (see The  Times of October15th), the representatives of  the Jugo-Slav Parliamentary Club in Vienna have issuedthe following proclamation : &quot; The Austro-Hungarian. Monarchy is not competent toundertake any peace steps on behalf of any nationality save the Germans and Magyars.The  J ugo-Slavs  demand peace,  but this can  only be based  upon  the following principles :-(I)  ddie Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes are a single indivisible  iieople,wherever they live ; (2) they can only consent to a peace  based upon the  right  ofpeoples to determine  their own fate ;  (3) the Jugo-Slavs must be allowed themselvesto decide whether they wish  to create their independent  State or  to conclude an inter-national union with  airy other State which  already&apos; exists  or  may be constituted;(4) no section of Croato-Serbo-Slovene nation can be subjected to foreign domination :this  people  must be united within the  Jugo-Slav  State ;  (5) the Jugo-Slavs uncler-take  to grant to minorities all rights of cultural development: the Adriatic ports willbe open to all peoples, on the basis of suitable  agreements ; (6) the Jugo-Slavs willnot recognise seaj peace concluded without their participation, and demand admission to the Peace Conference for representatives of the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes.&quot; Thispronouncement has been signed  by  Dr. Kbrosehetz for the National Slovene Council.The Dalmatian Deputy, Dr. Balat, on behalf of his Dalmatian colleagues, Mr. Pavilitchfor the Starcevitch Party of Croatia, Mr. Raditch  for  the  Croatian Peasant Party,Mr. Ivrasojevitch for the Radical Serb Party,  MM. Bukseg aud Koratz in  the name ofthe Jugo-Slav Socialist Party, and by the well-known  Croatian Deputies, Budisavljevitchand  Lorkovitch,  and  has been  endorsed  by the Croat  and  Serb representatives  ofBosnia.     According to a  further report (see  The Times of  October 21st)  the Jugo-SlavCommittee of London, at  a  meeting  held on October 19th,  authorised its President,Dr. Trumbitch, to issue a declaration in which it says : &quot; The  Jugo-Siav Committeeof London,  as the representative and mandatory of seven million  Serbs, Croats, andSlovenes of  Austria-Hungary,  and of the numerous Southern Slav communities  in north and South America and the British Dominions, definitely rejects the manifestoaddressed on October 16th by the Emperor Charles to 1 bis &apos;  peoples, ddie Committeespeaks on behalf of the Southern Slavs of the Austro-Hungariaii Monarchy, to whomthe oppressive rule  of that same  monarch  denies  free utterance.   Our  people  arethoroughly  determined to sever every tie with the Hapsburgs and  their Monarchy.The Jugo-Slavs emphatically deny the right of the Hapsburgs to speak in their name.Like  the changes  in  the  past, the  change now projected would serve only to cover the naked reality  of Hapsburg despotism,  to  which the  Southern Slavs have  forcenturies been exposed.  . .  . The Emperobs manifesto, wdiich presents his scheme tothe world  as the beginning of liberty and  self-determination, is  thus  a  piece  ofaudacious  hypocrisy.   The Southern  Slav  people  in  Austria-Hungary,  Serbia,Montenegro, have abundantly proved during the Avar their  unshakable resolve to  beunited in one independent and democratic State.  Therefore, the -JUGO-SLAA&apos;- Committeeprotests against any and eA^ery suggestion that the Jugo-Slav ideal can  be attained inany form whateA^er Avithin the Hapsburg Monarchy.  Our people await this attainmentthrough the victory  of the Allies  and of the  United  States,  to  which they have contributed  by every means  in their power.&quot;     In a despatch, dated October  9th, to Sir  C.  des  Graz, Mr. Balfour  records therespective  views of  M.  Trumbic and M.  Pasitch  upon the  Jugo-Slav question.M. Trumbic declares that all  Jugo-Slavs, Avhether Serbs, Croats, or Slovenes,  desireto be incorporated with  Serbia in  one State under one  Crown, but that they mustenter that State as equals and not  as subordinates.  M. Pasitch, on the  other hand,maintains that the liberation, of the Jugo-Slavs should  come from the Serbians alone,and that the latter should occupy a predominant position in the  neAV State.  Further,that  the Serbian GOA*ernment should alone speak now and at the Peace Conference inthe name of  all Serbs, Slovenes, and Croats of that State.  Mr. Balfour has impressed upon both the necessity of an early agreement between -the  Serbian Government andthe Committee, and  has intimated-to  M. Pasitch that the Serbian  Government, if it.
-claims to represent all sections, might with advantage open its ranks to less exclusiveelements than those of which it is at present composed, c.g., by including a couple  of-Jugo-Slav Ministers.  Mr,  Graham e  reports that  the  Montenegrin  Government  ismuch perturbed at the prospect of a possible absorption of Montenegro by Serbia.     Poland. The Foreign. Office learns that the Galician Deputies in the Reichsrat,after conferring at Cracow, have  proceeded to Warsaw.   The railway  directors  atCracow have informed the Railway Ministry at Vienna  that they no  longer consider themselves under its  orders,  but will  take  their  instructions  from the  polish authorities.   The Austrian administration has taken  drastic action  in  the  matter.It  is  stated  that Viennese Court  circles were  furious when  they  first heardof  the  manifesto issued  by the  Polish Council  of  Regency (see Report No.  90).They  very soon  calmed  down, however,  and  openly admitted  that Galicia musthenceforth be considered  as irrevocably lost to  the  Austrian Crown.  Addressingthe Foreign Affairs Committee of  the  Hungarian  Delegation,  Baron Burian  said:&quot; In  so  far  as this  proclamation proclaims  the  principle  of  the  free  decisionof  the  Polish  nation  with, regard  to  its  future  fate, it coincides. with  thosepolitical guiding  lines which we  have followed towards  the Polish  State since itsbirth,  as we held that this State must  itself decide its fate.  Our  sentiments towards -Poland are unaltered, and as hitherto  we will, whilst paying regard to the rightsand interests  of the  Austro-Hungarian Monarchy,  and in accord with  Germany, do our best to promote the building up of the Polish State, and  to support to  the best of  our ability all efforts of  the  Polish Government that  aim at the welfare of Poland.&quot;An official telegram  from  Lublin (via Amsterdam,  October 15th) states  that the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy is ready to abolish the military administration of AustrianPoland and to hand over  the administration, to the  Polish Government, as soon as thelatter  is ready to take it  over.  The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy  will do everythingto  facilitate for the Polish Government the  reconstruction of the  State organisation,.and at its recpuest will supply Poland  with whatever it lacks in. the way of money and organisation.    On the other hand, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy expects that Poland wdll assist it from its surplus of foodstuffs and raw materials for equivalent compen- sation.   The.present  military requisitions will be  stopped, and the administration of the State handed over to the Polish organisations which are to be created.  According to the  Polish  Press Bureau  at Berne,  the  Austrians have already commenced to withdraw their forces from the Austrian zone of occupation.     German   Wireless    (October  10th)   states :   &quot; The   Frankfurter  Zeitung characterises the latest appeal to the  Prussian Poles, according to which  the Prussian provinces of  Posen, Western Prussia, and a portion of  Silesia would  be placed under foreign   domination, and  Eastern  Prussia  separated,  from the  Empire,  as  a falseInterpretation  of the Wilsonian  programme, and  a hindrance  to peace  between Germany  and  the  Poles  as  well   as  the  workFs peace.&quot;    German  Wireless  (October 16th) reports  from  Danzig :   &quot; With the  object  of helping to keep the province of  Western Prussia,  with the capital  of  Banzig, within  the  German Fatherland, a People&apos;s Committee of  National Defence has met here, wdiich demands the formation of a similar People&apos;s Committee formed of all jjarties to co-operate with it.&quot;  German Wireless of October 18th states : &quot; The National Liberate Korrespondenz demands that  German  troops shall  be withdrawn from Poland, and that no German administrative officials shall be left in  the  country.  The attitude of the Poles was not such as to  render it necessary for the Germans in.  Poland to  make any effort to uphold  the Polish dignitaries,  or to form a rampart against Bolshevism for the Polish -authorities.&quot;     Count de Salis reports that the Pope is addressing a letter to the Polish  Bishops reaffirming the right of the  Poles to  independence and  the  strong  sympathy of  the-Holy  See  with their aspirations.   The  Pope proposes  to create the  Archbishop of Warsaw a Cardinal at the earliest opportunity.GERMANY.    The Internal Situation.

*a fortnight longer than  had originally been  intended,  illustrate the confusion and. uncertainty into which German  politics have  fallen.  A reliable informant, who was in the Berlin Foreign Office on October 9th, states that the machinery of administration was out of -gear, and  discipline  and authority at  an end.  Matters fell into a similar- pass on the fall of  Herr von Bethmann-Bolhveg in 1917 ; but  subsequent  military successes helped the nation to recover itself.   This time the chances of restoring the military situation are small; and ever since 1917 the deterioration in the national fibre has been  rapid.  It  is  not  so  much  actual  revolution that  is  feared as a general breakdown of  order  followed  by  spasmodic  strikes and riots.   Well-authenticated stories of  peace demonstrations and processions are received each day.  One some- what  serious incident appears to have taken place in Berlin on October 12th, when the Conservatives organised a pro-war meeting at the  Hindenburg statue in Berlin. This was  dispersed  by  the crowd and general disorder  ensued, for several  hours.. Another demonstration took place on October 16th, when the police used their swords. On October 17th there was  again  serious trouble, when the mob  tiled to  make its. way to the  Palace.  Rumours continue of  the intended abdication  of  the  Kaiser and the renunciation by the Crown  Prince of his  rights of succession.   There appears- to be a widespread belief that the Allies  will not  make peace  until  such a  step  is taken.   It  is stated  that  civilian  circles are  in  favour of the  appointment,  of the .KaiseFs grandson, under a regency, but that military  and official  circles consider- that this  would  involve  the  collapse  of  the  Prussian  system,  and.  therefore favour the  appointment of  Prince  August  Wilhehn.  Mr. Branting  is reported to attribute  the  conciliatory   tone  of   the  German   Note  largely  to the  hope- of  the  German   Government   that  the   Associated   Powers   might  thereby be  deterred  from  insisting  upon  such  abdication.    The  Frankfurter  Zeitung (quoted by German  Wireless of October 18th) says:  &quot;To-day we  think  that this mistrust (i.c, of German  sincerity  by the Allies) no longer holds  good,  after  a far- reaching domestic transformation,  a  bloodless revolution, the  effects of wdiich the English &apos; glorious revolution&apos; of  1688 cannot even approach  at  all, has made the German nation the master of its fate and the  guarantee  for the treaties which we&apos; are- to conclude regarding war and  peace.  .  .   .  The Germany which emerges from the present reforms, wdiioli.are a complete transformation, is indeed an entirely new Germany, even though the old powers continue  to exist.   How the  bearers of this. power accommodate themselves  to  the new state of affairs is chiefly their personal business, but it can  no  longer, have  any influence on  the further course of  things. The nation and the Reichstag will see to that.&quot;  Vorwarts is also quoted  as entering a caveat against too rapid democratisation as being likely to reintroduce a dictatorship... The Executive  Committee of the Social Democratic Party (quoted by German Wireless of October 21st)  utters a similar warning, and  points to  the progress  already achieved.     The Admiralty reports : &quot; According  to one reliable authority, Germany is keenly- apprehensive of catching the Bolshevist infection, and Vorwarts  confesses that many people are calling for a  Haase-Ledebour Government, and that  there would be little difference  between  a Ilaase-Bedebour and  a Lenin-Trotsky regime.   All  classes and   parties   appear . to  be   demoralised  and  broken-spirited,  except,  perhaps, the. Majority Socialists.   The  Frankfurter Zeitung speaks with extreme bitterness of  &apos; the  secret  military  dictatorship  which has  influenced  our  policy for  the last  two  years,  and  which   is  in  truth   responsible  for   all  this &apos;...... &apos; the  meddling of&apos;  Ludendorff &apos;  ....  &apos; the  wholly  false  appreciation  of  the military  situation.&apos;   ddie Bavarian Socialist Party calls for the trial of all persons guilty of frustrating  peace efforts, especially  Admiral  von Tirpitz  .   .  .   .  &apos; the inquiry must not stop short even at the steps  of  the throne.&apos;   Count Reventlow still tries to prove that German)- is undefeated; but his  pan-German friends are deserting- him.

For this  he  took up his pen.  Recollections  of  the  very typical Zabern  controversy of past  times  havefacilitated the task, and  thereby the feeling  with regard to  the services  of ourarmy7 leaders and. General Staff  is not  burdened  with  gratitude.   On the otherhand, one might almost say that he perceives, with  bitter rage, in our General  staff the source of that out-of-date militarism  wdiich our  enemies, and with  them  HerrGothein and his colleagues, are  desirous of getting out of the way.&quot;     According  to  German Wireless of October 21st the  Berlin newspapers reportthat,  on October 20th, the  Chief Censorship, office  ceased  to  be  a part  of the Wat-Press Office, and that in future  it will be  under the Supreme Military Commander,who  has taken measures  in  keeping with the recent  regulation of the  state ofsiege, so that his decrees and decisions  shall only be  taken in accord  with theImperial.

have telegraphed to  President Wilson on the subject, and  that  Mr. Branting, at therequest of  certain  Danes,  has  done the  same.   Meanwhile,  Herr  Eansen,  whorepresents  the district in the  German  Reichstag,  has put himself  in  touch,  withinterested circles in  Denmark, suggesting that, if the population of the purely Danishareas will themselves raise the  question, he may be able to obtain a  resolution  fromthe Reichstag in favour of their transfer to Denmark,  due Danish  Foreign Minister,in  conversation with Lord  Kilmarnock,  professed his inability  to see  anythingsuspicious  in such  a procedure.   It would appear that an immediate settlement isespecially urged in  the Rigsdag by a group of Radical, professors  with pro-German.tendencies.   There is reason to believe that negotiations are actually in progress forthe acquisition of  a   small part only of the territory, excluding a number  of Danish-speaking  districts,   whoso population,  being strongly agrarian, would  be  opposedpolitically  to the parties at present  in  office.  Sir  W.  Townley  reports that theHollandsch  Nieuics Bureau, a  German concern,  partly attributes the  German  delay in answering President Wilson to a note from the Danish Government proposing thebenevolent execution by Germany of Article 5 of  the Treaty of Prague.  The DanishPress of October 20th quotes  an article from the  Norddeulsche Allgemeine Zeitungdeclaring that to handle this question at the Peace Conference would be to submit tothe intervention of Germany&apos;s enemies  a  matter which  exclusively concerns herselfand one of her neutral and friendly neighbours.

Views of  General Mannerheim.- Mr.  Clive  reports  a conversation  held  onOctober 18th between himself and General Mannerheim,  Alluding to Swedish press reports  that  he  had  been requested  by the  Finnish  Government  to assume  adictatorship, the General, denied  that this was the case.  Regarding the withdrawalof  French recognition, he thought  it merely  annoyed Finns, who were genuinelydesirous  of good  relations with  the Allies.1   The removed  of  German troops wouldnot, in. his opinion, result in a fresh revolution, as the Reds  were practically unarmed.ddie Finnish Foreign Minister had greatly angered General  von cler Goltz by hintingthat the remaining German forces (3,000 to 4,000 in  number2) might be withdrawn.In connection with the passage of Allied  Missions through  Finland from Russia, theGermans had unshed to refuse such passage  to officers or men of military  age ; theFinnish Government, however, ordered that the Missions and  other refugees shouldbe given  every facility.   Finally, General Mannerheim  declared  that  the supply, assoon as possible, of food to  Finland would do more  than anything else to  promotegood feeling towards the Allies.  (Mr. Clive observes  that the United States minister has urged his Government to  allow 5,000 tons of food to  be sent forward to Narvik,so that time may not be lost after the Allies&apos; consent  shall have been, given.   On theassumption that the German forces will probably have left  Finland by the time sucha consignment reaches Narvik, Air. Clive endorses this proposal, emphasising that thissupply should clearly appear as the concerted  action  of the  Associated Powers.Meanwhile, Press advices from.

German Wireless  of  October 17th  observes: &quot;According  to Finnish papers,Prince Friedrich  Karl of Hesse  is said to have  declared  that in  no circumstances would he immediately accept the crown  of Finland wdiich had been  offered to him,but would  make his decision  dependent  on  the  development  of  events.    ddieaccession to the throne  could  only take place in. two years  at the earliest;  until thenan  interim Government must be introduced.&quot;           1 Grenuine annoyance seems principally confined to the Monarchist element.           2 How estimated by His Majesty&apos;s Consul  at Helsingiors to be about 2,000.

Application to the Pope.--Count de Salis learns  that  on October 13th the GrandDuchess of Luxemburg appealed to the Pope, both personally and in the name of herpeople, requesting his intervention with the belligerent Powers  in  order to obtain (1)the evacuation of the Grand Duchy by Germany, (2) recognition of its  neutrality byall the Powers.  Count  de Salis  has pointed out to the  Cardinal-Secretary that theproposal came  somewhat unsuitably from a State through which Germany had for four years been attacking France, and that in present circumstances recognition ofthe neutrality of Luxemburg would seem  to&apos;  favour the Germans.   The Cardinal -Secretary  expressed  the opinion that the Pope was not disposed to take any action inthe matter.                                   MEXICO.     Tampico and the Oilfields.

                                NETHERLANDS.     Comment on the American Offer of Coal. Mr. Robertson reports that on October 1,5th the United States  Minister addressed  a Note to the Netherlands Government offering 100,000 tons of  coal per month to he fetched to Holland from the United.&apos; States by vessels at present in Dutch ports, on the sole condition that the Netherlands Government should cease exporting to Germany, in exchange for German coal, food- stuffs required by the Dutch people.   The Note further intimated the readiness of the- United States Government to discuss the supply of a considerable proportion of Dutch. cereal requirements from United States ports instead of from more distant  ports, so as to, effect an economy of tonnage.   Sir W. Townley reports that  while Hanclelsbldd welcomes this offer, it has not been very favourably received by the Dutch Press as a whole,   ddie Nieuwe Rotterdamselhe Courant declares that  its conditions,: as involving a practical violation of  neutrality, render it valueless;  the paper takes offence at the- implied suggestion that, in Germany s present unfavourable situation, Holland would be more susceptible of  pressure to join in. the Allied food blockade.  Nevertheless, it welcomes the offer as a  splendid argument for Holland in her coming negotiations wdth. Germany.   Maasbode, which, though not inspired, accurately reflects the views of  the Catholic party, apprehends that America would buy Holland&apos;s economic neutrality, and regards the offer as intended to be  read in  -Berlin as an annex to President.Wilsons- reply to the peace offer.   A similar interpretation appears to be placed by the Nether- lands Government on the communique of a German Press agency in Holland which attributes the delay in the German reply (inter alia) to  &quot; increased pressure brought to bear on Holland by the Entente.&quot;   (And see under &quot; Denmark.&quot;)     East Indies Convoy.

The firms concerned  will  be at  liberty to denounce this undertaking at  three months&apos; notice if they so desire, in which case the associated Governments will be free to restore them to the Biack List.   The ForeignOffice instructs  Sir M. Findlay that  the  United  States War Trade Board  interpretsArticle 5 of the Norwegian-American Agreement  as leaving His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfree to claim  compensation  from Norway in respect of copper goods  imported from.the United States.  (See Report No. 90.)        .  -                           SPAIN.     The Transferred German Ships. Air. Madden  reports that on  October 18th the-Spanish mercantile  flag was hoisted  on the interned German steamer Eriphia&apos;atBilbao.  According to a Press report, the German Consul  was-present.     Sir A. Hardinge raises the question of  Allied  recognition of the transfer  of the-seven German ships  to the Spanish flag.  The Foreign Office, in requesting him toascertain  the terms of  transfer  and  employment,  points  out  that the  right to information on this subject is unquestionable.  (See Report No. 90.)     Bunkering of Spanish  Grain Ships. Sir A. Hardinge reports that the Spanish.Minister of Supplies  is A^eiy anxious that bunkers should be supplied to Spanish grainships at present detained  at Buenos Aires and Monte Video.  Apparently the SpanishGovernment  would  be puepared to replace such  bunkers.  The Foreign Office has.intimated to the Spanish Ambassador that  bunkers might be provided proportionedto additional deliveries of iron ore by Spanish ships to the United Kingdom.  .
SWEDEN.     Commercial-Relations  with Bolshevist Government.. Mr. Clive reports that theSwedish Government  has  lately  been much  concerned  at the  increasing  unrestamong  the labouring classes  (see also under  &quot; Finland),  and  the agitation by tlieextreme Socialists  for  cheap  food  and   clothing.   Mr.  Clive also  communicatesevidence tending to show  that the Swedish Government is giving informal sanction to  an  arrangement  under  which  all.  exchange of goods between  Sweden and russia  is to  take place  through the Northern Commune Commissariat, with mutualfacilities for  credits, licensing, and transport.  The existence of such an arrangement would seem, necessarily  to aifect trie political attitude of the Swedish government towards the BoVnevist Government.  The Foreign  Office  instructs  Mr. Clive  toascertain how  it is  proposed  to   reconcile  this scheme  with  Article   4  of  theSwedish Agreement.  (See Report &quot;No. 73.)                                SWITZERLAND. &apos;    Gratification  at  Allied Successes. Sir  II. Rumbold reports  that the  Alliedsuccesses are regarded with evident satisfaction  in responsible Swiss circles.   (and see under &quot; General.&quot;)    Ministry  of  Food,-The  W.T.I.D.  reports (October  13th):  &quot;The federal government  has set  up  a Ministry  of  Food, which  will, take over duties hithertoperformed by the various Swiss - Departments.  The  new Ministry  will, control all measures touching food supplies, the acquisition of fodder stuffs, and distribution ofraw materials  and manufactured  goods,  the fixing  of  prices and the regulationsagainst profiteering.   It will be placed under a  Director  nominated by the  federal council,  who  will attend  the  meetings of the Federal Council whenever  questions.are discussed affecting his Department.&quot;    Swiss-Allied Negotiations. Mr.  Barclay reports  various  considerations  whichwould seem to have settled the opinion of the United States Government in favour of washington as the most suitable place for the resumption of commercial negotiationswith the  Swiss Government.  It is suggessted that programmes and technical points should be previously discussed in Paris,  Berne and London, and that representativesof the Allies should then attend the negotiations.  (And see Reports Nos. Si) and 90.)                                   URUGUAY. .     Attitude towards the War. The  Foreign Office instructs Mr. Mitchell  limes, in reference to information recently communicated by  him (see  Report No. 88), that HisMajesty^ Government would still welcome the entry of Uruguay into the war.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.       (N.B. Countries arc arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)     General. The  Naval  and  Military  representatives,  Supreme  War  Council,submitted  proposed  conditions  (October 8th) for an armistice to be  granted toGermany.   The  conditions  include   retirement  behind   the  Rhine ;  immediateoccupation by Allied troops of evacuated territory of France,  Belgium, Luxemburg,and  Italy ; repatriation of  civil population ;  evacuation of Alsace-Lorraine, Serbia,Montenegro and Albania; also of the Caucasus, and all  territory belonging to Russia     0633Ay,                            K
and Rumania before the war ;  surrender of Metz, Thionville, Strassburg, Neu Rrisach,and  Heligoland;  besides  Naval  conditions,  especially that  60  submarines  shallproceed to Allied  ports and remain  there  during armistice; blockade  to  continue.These proposals were signed  by the British, French, and Italian  representatives, butnot by the American.     The  Political Intelligence Department (October 10th) supply  a  valuable  precisof German, Austro-Hungarian., and American peace  Notes between October 4th  and12th inclusive [G.T. 5976].     It has again been impossible this week to embody the valuable material supplied by the Admiralty,  the Ministry of Information, and the War  Office Daily  Review.     Austria-Hungary. There have   been  further  indications (Sir H.   Rumbold(October  14th, 16th and 18th), Sir W. Townley (.19th), Lord  Acton (Berne, 18th.)) of a desire for a separate peace.   (See also under &quot; Spain  &quot; aud &quot; Vatican.&quot;)     Mr. Barclay (Washington) on  October 19th forwarded  the  text of the Austro-Hungarian, Note of October 7th to President Wilson, and the following text of the reply, dated October  18th :      &quot; I have  honour to acknowledge receipt your note 7th  instant in which  youtransmit communication  Imperial Royal-Government Austria-Hungary to President.I  am now  instructed by President  request  you  be  good  enough through your government to convey to Imperial Royal Government following reply :       &quot; &apos; President  deems  it his  duty to say  to  Austro-Hungarian  Government he cannot entertain present suggestions of that Government because of certain events ofutmost importance which  occurring since delivery his address January 8th last havenecessarily altered 1 attitude  and responsibility Government  United States.   Among14 terms of peace wdiich  President  formulated at that  time  occurred  following : (10)  Peoples Austro-Hungary whose place among nations we wish see safeguarded  andassured should be  accorded freest opportunity autonomous  development.  Since thatsentence was  written and uttered to Congress  United States  Government,  UnitedStates has  recognised  that state  belligerency  exists  between  Czech-Slovaks  andGerman Austro-flungarian  Empires  and that Czecho-Slovak National Council is dafacto belligerent Government  clothed with proper authority to direct military  andpolitical affairs  Czecho-Slovaks.  It has also recognised in fullest manner  justicenationalistic aspirations Jugo-Slavs for freedom.   President  is therefore no  longerat liberty  accept mere &quot;autonomy &quot; these peoples as  basis peace, but is obliged- insistthey and not he shall  be judges what action  on  part Austro-Hungarian  Governmentwill satisfy their aspirations and their conception their rights and destiny as members-family of nations.&apos; &quot;    The reply was reproduced in German Wireless of October 21st.     France. Lord Derby, on  October 21st and 22nd, gave extracts from the french press  approving  President  WilsoiFs  reply  to  the  Austro-Hungarian  Note - ofOctober 7th, and  criticising  the German reply of October 20th  to the PresidentsNote of the 14th.  On the 19th he  gave  a  precis  from the Debuts of  a resolution bythe Committee  of French Asia demanding the immediate adoption of  an  active policy to safeguard the traditional situation of  France  in  Syria  in  connection  wdth thediscussion of peace with Turkey, and  on the 22nd a further extract from the Debatscontaining the  words : &quot; The vanquished Emperor hides behind  his Ministry ready toreappear at the right moment in shining armour.&quot;     Germany. Telegrams  from Lord kilmarnock  (October  .17th)  and  Mr.  Olive(Stockholm, 1.8th) give further indications  of  anxiety about  the situation  in  the occupied  territories on the  Eastern  Frontier, in the Ukraine  and the Caucasus, if germany  should withdraw  her troops.  (See under the respective countries  in lastvreek&apos;s Report.)     According  to information sent by Sir PL Rumbold  (October 18th), based upon  areliable source, the Kaiser&apos;s abdication,  the giving up of Alsace-Lorraine and theoccupation  by  Allied forces of Metz, would  not  be considered as &quot; dishonourable&quot;terms of peace, but that this term would be applied  to the occupation of  such a place as Cologne, and to the surrender of all German war  vessels.   (See also under General,..above.) Lord Kihnarnock, on  October 1.9th,  forwarded  information  confirming  this,as far  as  affecting  Alsace-Lorraine, and  Sir 11. Rumbold (October .17th) as  affectingthe Kaiser.
     There are indications  that, both for  political and for financial reasons, germany is now compelled to make peace (Lord Acton, October 19th).     On  October 19th, Sir  W. Townley gave extracts  from German Press articles onthe peace negotiations.   Dr.  Ludwig Haas  writes in  the  Tageblatt that the Germanpeople  &quot;have been lied to.&quot;   On  October 21st, Sir W. Townley reported that the reply to President  Wilson&apos;s Note  of  October  1.4th  was delayed in order that the-concurrence of all political parties might first be obtained.     German Wireless of October 17th-21st is full of  peace discussions,  very much onthe same lines as last week.   The  impression conveyed is  that  the sacrifice of the newly discovered German &quot; honour &quot; would  cause the nation to rally and resist morevigorously ; the allegation  that German  democratic control has now been establishedis constantly  repeated.  Tdie  danger  of  Bolshevism  in  all countries,  if a peace inaccordance with German desires is not achieved, is again advanced.     German Wireless of October 21st published tire text  of  the reply to PresidentWilson&apos;s Note of the 14th.  ddie  text  is the same  as that published  in the british press, and there are no indications in it of an approach on the subject of an armistice tothe recognised authority for granting such an armistice, the Commander of the armies in the field.  On October 23rd German Wireless  published the text of Prince Max&apos;sspeech of the  22nd,  which,  has been reproduced in The Times.     Holland. According to reports from Sir A. Hardinge (October 19th) and Sir W.&apos;Townle3^ (October 22nd) there  seems to be  no prospect of the Dutch  Governmentsresponding to  any appeals  from  Sweden  for a combined  action  by  neutral governments in connection with peace  discussions at the present stage.  (See underSpain, in last  week&apos;s report.)     On  October  22nd Sir W. d^ownley called attention to  the reproduction  in theKolnische Zeitung of an  article in the Geneva La Feuille, obviously;Tntended to raisealarm in Holland about the question of the  Scheldt and Dutch Flanders.     Italy. Peportsd&apos;rom  Sir  B.  Rodd (October 16th,  17th and. 18th) indicate thedesire of the Italian CSovernment to keep the public informed about the true meaning of the German  peace overtures to  President Wilson, and the necessity for makingsure that public opinion, especially amongst the Socialists, should be kept straight inthese matters.     There are further  indications (Sir R. Rodd, October 19th) of the interest takenby the Italian Government in the future of Asia Minor, in connection with peace with turkey.  (See cdso under France,  as affecting Syria.)     Italian Wireless of  October 2lst-22nd, contains  comments on President WilsoiPsreply to the Austro-Hungarian Note, and indicates Italian interest in the  Czecho-Slovakand Jugo-Slav questions.     Lithuania.. German Wireless of  October  22nd gives the official German attitudetowards the future Government of Lithuania on the principle of self-determination, atthe same time indicating the  intention &quot; to leave the  troops and means  of transport inthe country for the time being.&quot;     Rumania. ddie Allied Ministers (October  12th) draw attention to announcementsin Nauen Wireless about the alleged disposal of part of  the Dobrudja in the terms of  ---the  Bulgarian  armistice.    The  French  Foreign   Minister  has again  announced(October  15th) that  territorial questions will only be settled at the general peace.  OnOctober  17th the  Allied.  Ministers reported  a violent campaign in  the BucharestPress against  the Entente  Alliance on the question-of peace terms.     The  Political Intelligence  Department (September  19th)* provide a very valuablesummary  (G.T. 6037) of the  meaning and effect of the Bucharest Trealy and itsA-various corollaries, with  a  useful map.     Russia. (See under Germany, Lithuania, and Ukraine.)     Spain. Austrian merchant ships appear to have  received  instructions to getready to return to an Adriatic  port, in  the  event of  Austria making peace.  (Sir A.Hardinge, October 16th.)     Sweden. -On October 17th Mr.  Clive reported  general  disappointment in the-Swedish Press at President WilsoiFs Note to Germany of October 14-th.
&apos;:  %&apos;  Switzerland. Sjr H. Rumbold, (October Midi) indicates the pressure being broughtto bear upon the Swiss Government by various peace committees, and the improbabilityof the Swiss  Government taking any  action uninvited by the belligerents on  bothsides.     Turkey. Information received (Lord Derby October 15th, Sir PL Rumbold I Oth-14th, Mr. Barclay 17th-T9th) still indicates the helplessness of the Turkish Governmentin making peace overtures while Constantinople is under the guns of  German-manned&quot;war vessels.  The  Journal des Debate of October 15th makes the suggestion thatthe difficulty could soon  be solved if Turkey opened the Dardanelles &quot; in accordancewith President  Wilson&apos;s  principles  of freedom  of  the seas.&quot;   (See also under united States.)     Ukraine. Russian  Wireless  of October  20th  announces  that  &quot;America hasreplied to the Ukrainian Government, in regard to enquiries respecting representation.at the Peace Conference,  that America would like to see representatives of the wholeof Russia.&quot;     On  October  17th Russian  Wireless called attention  to  an  article by  Radek.in Izvestia, in connection with the  evacuation of  the  Ukraine by  German troops.&quot; Ludendorff and Ilindenburg pray Wilson to have pity on them, so that they umy  beof use in  the near future in the  struggle against  Bolshevism, because now already the wave of Bolshevism is threatening the whole world.&quot;     United &quot;Stales. Reports from  Mr. Barclay, dated  October 17th, 18th and .19th,pointed to the probability of the President, in  reply to the Turkish. Note, recommending the Turkish Government to apply to the Military Commander for an armistice.     On October 23rd Mr. Barclay forwarded the text of the reply of  the Governmentof the United-States to the German Note.  The following are  important extracts from.that reply :      (1)  President has transmitted his correspondence with present German authorities           to Governments with which United States Government is associated as belli--            gerent, with  suggestion that if those Governments are disposed to effect           peace upon  terms and  principles  indicated, their military advisers and           military advisers  of United States be  asked to submit  to Governments            associated  against Germany necessary terms of  such an armistice as will            fully protect  interests  of  peoples  involved,  and ensure  to associated           Governments unrestricted power  to safeguard and enforce details of peace           to which  German Government  has agreed,  provided they deem such           armistice possible from military point of view.     (2) The United  States Government cannot  deal with  any pjut  veritable repre-           sentatives  of  German  people  who   have been  assured  of  genuine           constitutional standing as real rulers of  Germany.  If it  must deal  with           military masters and monarchical autocrats  of Germany  now, or  if &quot;it is           likely to  have to  deal  with them  later, in  regard  to- international           obligations of German  Empire it must demand not  peace  negotiations            but surrender.   Nothing  can be gained by leaving  this  essential, thing&quot;           unsaid.     Vatican. Information received  from Mr. Barclay (October  19th) confirms the-impression  that the  Pope is  anxious for President Wilson to  use  his influence toenable Austria-Hungary to arrange for peace  separately.
