&quot;      10 6SECRET.   A PlMt EOLATION  OF  THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                               -REPORT  No.  88.                      PART II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.                          PEACE DISCUSSIONS (page 15).     The terms  of the armistice with Bulgaria seem  to  have been settled by  themilitary commander on the spot, General  Franchet d&apos;Esperey.  The terms place theAllies in a favourable position  for peace  discussions,  when  those  discussions  takeplace.   Events  seem  to  be following the course  anticipated.  There  are  definiteindications in Switzerland  of official peace overtures by  Turkey.  Austria Hungaryseems likely to follow  suit  before long.  Germany&apos;s policy is  still to try and  avoiddefeat by  creating  a peace atmosphere  in  enemy  countries,  and  especially  toendeavour  to get neutrals to intervene.  It is doubtful  whether she puts  any hopesin the Scandinavian Rings, but  there  are  indications of an  attempt to influence the queen of Holland.     At  this  stage it may  be interesting  to refer  to Appendices to former Reportscontaining precis  of President WilsoiFs &quot;Fourteen Point&quot; speech, and its originalreception in enemy countries.   References to these Appendices are given in a note onpage 15.     In  view of  the continued dominance of the  military leaders over the Germannation  and  policy, the Appendix to  Report No. 52 has been brought up to date byadditional  quotations, and repeated as an  Appendix to this Report.                                GENERAL (page 2).     The repatriation of  interned, and of prisoners, both from Germany and  from turkey, is not working satisfactorily.                                ALLIED  COUNTRIES.     Brazil (page 3). ddie United States are taking an interest in the Brazilian Navy.     France  (page 4). German  Wireless is deriving satisfaction from recent Socialist developments:     Italy  (page 4). ddie Jugo-Slav question is  dealt with.     Japan (page 6). A list is, given  of  the new Cabinet, which  seems  to contain conflicting elements, as affecting policy in Siberia.                                ENEMY  COUNTRIES.     Austria-Hungary (page 7). &quot; Federalisation &quot; movements are described.                                                                          [P.T.O.
    Germany (page 8). All the matter under this heading is of interest, as indicating the internal situation, and &quot; parbamentarisation &quot; proposals.    Now  that  the  prospect  of  a  &quot; rich future,&quot; promised by the War Lord  to  thepeople as the result of this war, is  fading away, it may be that there will be a genuinedesire for a Peace Lord.   The&apos;, KaiseFs intention to fill that part himself is indicated.    So far, there is no prospect of  any genuine  control  over  the Army  by  theReichstag,  or by the Chancellor, as representing the people.   It seems not unreason-able to connect the much advertised  reforms  with President Wilson&apos;s scheme  for admission of all free nations into a proposed League.                               NEUTRAL  COUNTRIES.    Chile (page 11) seems inclined to take a  firm  line with Germany, now  that  themilitary situation is in favour of the Allies.    Finland (page  12) may possibly be  saved  from  German  domination  by  thesuccesses of the Allies on the Western Front.    Norway (page 13) is taking a strong line  to stop the use of her territorial  watersby submarines.    Spain (page 14) has still taken no action about seizure of German shipping.                                                                     G.  G. A.    October 3rd, 1918.

PART  II.- FOREIGN  AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.    Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence  Bureau, the total tonnageof 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in  the  case of sailing-ships, reported lost  owing to  tire  malice  of the Iving&apos;s enemies during the periodSeptember 20tlr-26th  inclusive, was 34,510 tons gross, of which 21,239 were British,as compared  wdth 51,457 tons gross, of  which. 43.831 were British, reported lastweek.    ddre Board of Trade (G.T. 5857)  reports : &quot;  In August, total losses of british shipping  of  over  500 gross tons amounted to 195,000 gross tons, of which 145,000were due to war risk, as  against a  total loss in July  of 188,000 tons.  British  builtvessels  brought into service  amounted  to 137,000 tons, and total gains, includingpurchases  and requisitioned vessels, to 140,000  tons.   War losses  of  the  Allies(other than British) in August were 89,000 tons as against 71,000 tons in July, and neutrals 40,000 tons as  against 25,000 tons in  July,  and  39,000 tons  in. June.ddre average of World war losses to British,  Allied and Neutrals combined over  thefirst eight months  of 1918 amounts to about 290,000 tons a month.&quot;    An Admiralty report dated September  30th states that since the outbreak of war13,050,000 tons gross have been sunk,  of which 8,050,000 were  British.    (See also Official Statistics reported in  The Times of October 3rd at page 8.)    Neutral Conference regarding Decisions of Belligerent Prize Courts. ddre ForeignOffice learns that a neutral conference is being held at Copenhagen  to  discuss  the advisability of concerted  action with a view principally to  obtaining the revision of decisions of belligerent Prize Courts,   ddre  Conference has been,  summoned by  theNetherlands  Government.; and Holland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark  are  eachrepresented by six delegates.  It would seem that proposals are to be  made for  theinstitution of a Supreme  International Court of Appeal in the Prize  Court.  There is reason to believe that the German submarine outrages will be strongly indicted  by certain  delegates.    The Anglo-German  Prisoners Agreement. German  Wireless of  October  1stdeclares that the  ratification of the Anglo-German Agreement  of  July  14th  (seeReport  No. 77) has so far not been effected owing to (1) a  stipulation by the BritishGovernment to exclude  submarine crews  from  repatriation,  (2) the  failure  of  theBritish  Government to settle satisfactorily the situation regarding German subjects inChina.  A criticism of the German contentions appears in  The Times of October  2ndat page 9.    Repatriation  of Women  and  Children  from German  occupied Territory. -Mr. Robertson learns that the German authorities  have postponed  further transportof  British women and  children to England  pending the ratification of  the  new agreement (see above).   Be has  transmitted through the  Netherlands authoritiesa  request  for the  immediate repatriation of  women  and  children  from  the occupied districts, pointing out that His  Majesty&apos;s Government has lately transporteda large  number of German women  from England.  In  anticipation of a satisfactoryreply, Mr.  Robertson is endeavouring to  secure the  continuance of the  hospital serviceuntil the end of October.    Anglo-Turkish  Prisoners , Agreement. The Foreign  Office  learns through theNetherlands Government that the Ottoman. Government now appears  to to have  lostany interest it ever had in the execution of the Berne  Agreement.   The NetherlandsMinister nevertheless proposes to continue  his representations in the matter.
ALLIED  GROUP.                                    BRAZIL.    Question of Economic Co-operation with Allies. Air. Barclay reports the opinions of the American Ambassador  and the Italian Minister at Rio, shared  by the UnitedStates Government, that  it is desirable to  await certain changes  in  the  brazilian government  before  presenting  a comprehensive scheme of economic co-operationbetween Brazil and  the Associated Governments.   Meanwhile  the State  Departmentdeprecates the resumption  by the French. Minister of independent negotiations forthe remaining 11 ex-enemy ships in Brazil.   (And see Reports Nos. 69,  71, 75, 76, 79,and 84-86.)    American Interest in Brazilian Navy. Sir  A. Peel learns of a proposal by  theUnited States Government that  a Brazilian naval contingent, headed by an Admiral,should be sent to New York for service in  United States vessels.   It is furtherreliably reported that the United States  Government has offered  to refit a Braziliancruiser free of cost.  (And see Report No. 82.)    Anniversary Day. October 26th being the anniversary  of the  declaration byBrazil of war upon Germany, the Foreign Office authorises  Sir A. Peel to  convey tothe Brazilian Government on that date a message of cordial congratulation.    The Note to Austria-Hungary. Sir  A.  Peel reports  that  the Brazilian Note to austria-Hungary (see Report No. 87), which has now been published by the ForeignMinister, was communicated both, at Vienna and Rio de Janeiro under date September4th, on which day the Brazilian squadron  left for European waters.   It asserts  the determination of the Brazilian nation to  make effective its protests of February 7thand 12th, 1917, to Germany  and Austria-Hungary respectively  against the Austro-German blockade.    Repatriation from Turkey. The - Foreign Office  learns that the Turkish doctorsare passing no one for repatriation  unless  he is visibly maimed.  They are alsosystematically excluding all officers.   An urgent protest has been transmitted, throughthe Netherlands Government.    British Prisoners of  War in Bulgaria.-The Foreign Office has requested  theFrench Government to endeavour to expedite the release  of British prisoners of warin Bulgaria.    Italo-Austrian  Prisoners  Agreement.-Italian  Wireless   of  September  28threports : &quot; The Italo-Austrian Berne Conference, after a  discussion on  the exchangeof sick and wounded prisoners, was closed by the President  with the signing of theagreement.&quot;    Poison Gas. The  German.  Government has issued  its  reply to  the appealaddressed  by  the  International  Committee  of  the  Red Cross  Society  to  all  the belligerent Powers, urging them  to  abandon the use  of deleterious and asphyxiatinggases.  The  text of the  reply will he found in The Times of September 21st.   Italleges that the use of  asphyxiating  gas  by the Allies was established, on. March  1st,1.91.5, while the first mention of its  use by the Germans was contained in the Britishand French bulletins of April 24th, 1.915.  &quot;Hence it is  not for Germany to take theinitiative in   suppressing the use  of gas.   If the countries  at war wdth Germanyapproach the  German. Government on  the subject, the  latter &apos;will  not hesitateexhaustively to study the question to see how far it  is possible to give adherence tosuch proposals, without prejudice to the vital interests of  the German people.&apos; &quot;     The Ministry of Information draws attention to the answer supplied  by antici-pation through British Wireless of July 23rd, 1918, disproving the German allegationsand exposing &quot; their common  form manoeuvre to justify their resort togas  by accusingthe Allies of  first using it.&quot;  (And see Reports Nos. 55, 65, 66 and 68.)
                                    CHINA.    North and South: American Dementi. Mr. Barclay reports that Mr. Lansing-has denied, as absolutely unfounded, a recent Press statement that Sir J. Jordan  haddelivered to the Chinese Government a joint offer  by the British and United states government of mediation between North and. South, which it was expected would be favourably received.  (And see Reports Nos.  85-87.)    Prevention of Disorder in British Territory. In view of disturbances in Chinesedistricts  bordering upon British territory  at  Wei-hai-Wei, the  Foreign Office hasauthorised the provision  of a  small British force  from Hong Kong for the  suppression of any disorder which may arise inside such territory.    Tibet. Sir J. Jordan learns that the  Kalou  Lhama  has  expressed  the intentionof  detaining the  Chinese General  Liu  until  the Chinese  Government  shall have signed the agreement for a truce and for  delimitation of  a provisional  frontier.   SirJ. Jordan urges that the Government  of India should  induce the  Dalai Lhama  to order the immediate and unconditional release of General Liu, pending  which  it willbe impracticable to approach the Chinese Government regarding ratification  of  theagreement; in any case, there appears to  be little prospect of such ratification.  (and see Reports Nos. 65, 76, 82,  83, and SC.)    (See also under &quot;Japan.&quot;)                                    FRANCE.    The Socialists:  German Interest in the International. ddre DJi. (A.P.S.)  ofSeptember 25th quotes the principal resolutions submitted for examination to theSocialist Federations by fractions of the party in anticipation of the October Congress.&quot;That  of  the  ex-Majority (Renaudel,  Thomas,  &amp;c.) makes no mention  of  Russia,whereas that of the  new Majority (Longuet, &amp;c.) strongly condemns  the Allied actionthere ; Renaudel repudiates all &quot; patched-up peace,&quot; and  gives  six points explaininghis fractions  attitude on  the subject, while Longuet does  not mention this at all.Renaudel deals with the responsibility of  the Central Powers  for the war ;  Longuetdoes not mention this either.  Renaudel makes the Society of Nations one of his mainaims, while Longuet, although  he is  prepared to support it, refuses to  make it a waraim.  Both sides  demand the passports, and  desire a  speedy  meeting of  the inter-national,  although  Renaudel  insists on the question  of tire  responsibilities being-examined there, while Longuet makes no conditions, throws all blame on &apos; Capitalism,&apos;and   repudiates . all  collaboration with the &apos; Bourgeois &apos; in  any form.   Both areprepared to refuse the war credit vote  if necessary, and both protest strongly againstthe condemnation of Malvy, and the &apos; bullying &apos; of the -working  classes.&quot;     German Wireless  of  September  27th states : &quot; The resolve of the ArbitrationCommittee of the French.Socialist Party to exclude the chief  editor of La Victoire,.M. Herve,-from the Party, is commented  upon by  Voricarts  as  follows: &apos; Thestruggle made by Herve for membership  of the Party has  been going on for three-and-a-half years.  Herve&apos;s connection with the Chauvinistic war-Criers rendered thedecision, which has now been come to, an overdue need.  That the French Party didnot come to this decision more speedily is suspicious, as Herve&apos;s  attitude  to the war has  seriously hemmed in the  efforts  at International rapprochement of the socialist parties.   It was  only  gradually  that  Herve&apos;s  influence in the  French  Partydiminished.   ddie ....  international recovery of the Socialist Parties, which havebeen torn asunder by the Avar, is proceeding step by step in France,  Coining at thopresent time, the withdrawal- of Herve, who has shown himself to be a shield-bearerof all the powers in France who advocate Avar to the last, is of no small symptomaticimportance.&apos; &quot;   (And sec Reports Nos. 68, 72, 75, 78, 84, and 85.)                                     ITALY.    Parliament. Italian  Wireless of September 29th  announces  that  the ItalianSenate and over House will reassemble on October 3rd.
    The Jugo-Slav Question. A Memorandum (G.T.  5798,  dated September 23rd)by the P.I.D. records  and criticises  the Italian Press  controversy in  regard to the jugo-Slav  question.  The protagonists in this discussion were the Gorriere delta Sera(which has the largest circulation in Italy and great influence  with the mass of themiddle-class) and the Giornale d&apos;Italia (whose influence is limited  to Conservativecircles),  the former protesting against the  sabotage by the  Consulta of the policyinitiated .at  the  Congress  of  Rome ; the  latter denying the  charge  &quot; anil  thenproceeding to go one  better than the  Consulta&apos;.&quot;   The  chief storm-centres  were (a)the divergence  between Orlando&apos;s and Sonnino&apos;s interpretations of the Pact of Rome,(5) the value of  the Treaty  of London, and  (c) its  compatibility or  incompatibilitywith  the  Pact of  Rome; (d)  the   question of  renunciations ; (e) the  sincerity of the  Southern   Slav  demand  for dndependence  of  Austria and the  attitudeof the Southern Slavs towards Italy ;  (/.)  the wisdom  or unwisdom  of  recognising the Southern Slav claim to be  united in a single independent  State.  &quot; The  issue would have been  clearer if the  Gorriere had  been prepared openly  to demand animmediate  revision of the Treaty of  London,  but  this is  desired  neither  by thebulk  of  Italian opinion  no&apos;r&quot;,* it is  believed,  by the  organisers of  the Italo-SlavEntente on  the  Slav  side,  e.g.,  M.  Trumbic.&quot;  Probably  the  preponderance ofopinion in Italy regards the Treaty of London as quite reconcilable with  the pact of Rome ;  and while sincerely in favour  of an Italo-Slav  Entente and co-operation,and prepared for  some concessions  (not Istria nor Trieste, nor perhaps Zara) whereItalian  and Slav territorial claims are in conflict,  it approves  of a certain  cautionin the development of the Pact of Rome policy and   does not  desire any revisionof the Treaty of London before the end  of the  war.   The Memorandum  points outthat there  is no great  cordiality about the  recent  declaration of the Italian Govern-ment (see  Report  No. 87)  and no  suggestion of  Italy  placing  herself at  the  headof the movement   for Jugo-Slav independence.  &quot;At   the same time it is  the  firstdefinite declaration of  the  Government as  a  whole on the Jugo-Slav question, andthe  phrase  &quot;constitution  in  a free  state&apos;  is  presumably  to be   regarded  as a recognition of the  Corfu programme.&quot;    The  Temps  cordially  approves  the declaration,  which  &quot; marks  considerable progress in the right direction.&quot;   Meanwhile, France and Great Britain &quot; are boundto honour their signatures to the Treaty of London so long as the Italian Governmentdesires that they should do so.&quot;    The Temps also publishes a statement by  M. Pashitch  inviting the Allies &quot; torecognise the right  of Serbia and  to assist  her  to liberate all her  brothers, and  to unite  with them   in a free and  independent State.&quot;   Pie  claims  that an Alliedpronouncement in this sense would raise the  moral of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes un austria-Hungary, and defeat Austrian schemes of federation ; a Jugo-Slav State created by  Serbia  in accordance  wdth  the  principles announced in  the Corfu  declaration would be an  eternal ally  of the  Entente.  Mr. Grahame reports that  in the  opinionof the King and Government of Montenegro, M. PashitclPs  declaration is  a publicadmission of Serbia&apos;s hostility to them  and of her policy of absorbing  her neighbour,Montenegro.   Allusion  is made to Italy&apos;s interest  in Montenegro, and it is hinted thatan  appeal  may be made to President Wilson to uphold the right of the Montenegrinsto dispose  of their own destiny.  (See also under &quot; Austria-Hungary,?&apos; and reports nos. 77, 78 and  81-86.)    State of Popidar Morale. In  a  despatch dated  September 19th,  Mr. Erskinereports that the  Austrian  Peace Note is regarded by Baron Sonnino  as designedto  encourage  the resistance,  of the  Centrals and  to promote defeatism  in thecountries of the Entente.   The general public spirit in Italy is at present excellentand is practically  unanimous  as  to  the necessity of rejecting  the proposals, thoughBaron Sonnino is not  quite happy as  to  the  effect  on the  country of&quot; a  seriousprolongation of the  war.   The Italian  Socialist  Party has  for some time  beenmeditating strong actiondn favour of peace,  and its  official organ, the Avanti, whichhas entirely identified itself with the  cause of the Bolshevists in Russia, recently issuedan article which practically invited  the Italian proletariat  to follow  their example.(And  see Reports Nos. 67-72 and 79.)    Italian-Swiss  Negotiations. Mr.  Barclay   reports  that   the   United  StatesGovernment is  addressing to the  Italian Government a strong protest against the exportation from Italy to Switzerland  of foodstuffs  and raw materials  of  the  samenature as those imported by Italy from the  United States.  The Allied governments are being invited to support this  protest.   (And see Reports Nos. 84-  and 85.)    C63:J-lb                              B
    Loans  to  China-Toe  Foreign  Office  learns  that the  local  authorities atNikolaevsk are anxious to obtain a loan of 50 million roubles from the Allies, securedupon the resources of  Sakhalin ; but  that the  Japanese are  offering to furnish theentire sum in exchange for exclusive mining rights and rights  of  navigation on theAmur.  The Admiralty  reports: &quot; Further loans  are  being  negotiated  between theJapanese Bank and the Chinese Government.  They are concerned wdth  the railways in the Provinces of Shantung and Inner Mongolia.  Two of these railway concessionshad.previously  been allotted to Germany.  A condition  of the loan is the agreement by China to the establishment in Shantung of Japanese centres of civil administration.Two further loans have been advanced for political  and  military purposes.  A. conditionof the military loan, according to Press reports, is that the  Chinese Army shall be instructed  by Japanese  officers and  that the  scope  of  the Sino-Japanese military agreement shall be extended.&quot;   (And see Reports Nos.  83 and 87 ;  also Nos. 69-73,77, 84, and 85 under &quot; China.&quot;)                              . MONTENEGRO.    Memorandum by   Montenegrin  Organisations   in  the   United  States. ddieAdmiralty  reports: &quot;A large  number of  Montenegrin organisations  for national unity  in  the  United States  have  published a Memorandum addressed  to  theAllied Cabinets.   This Memorandum  was signed by the local Committees  in theUnited  States  on  August  11th.   It  denounces  King Nicholas,  the   supreme commander  of the Montenegrin Army, for having sued, the Emperor of Austria for peace both by telegram and by direct application.  It  further denounces the King foropposing  the union -with Serbia as  proposed by  M.  Radovitch  and declines  torecognise as binding the  Government  of Montenegro the  acts of King  Nicholas aiid     Economic Outlook. German Wireless reports :-&quot; According to the calculations of Professor Koeppe Marburg, appearing in the August number of the Year Book for National Economics and Statistics, the Italian National Debt, at the  end of  1917, of 50 milliards of lire, represents 57 per cent, of the 887&apos;5 milliards  of lire of estimated Italian national property.   As the cost of the war increases  monthly by about one million lire, so Italy&apos;s National Debt, -after three further years of war,  would equal the total amount of Italy&apos;s national  property,  and  in case of a further  increase in the monthly expenses, in even less time.   Even at the end of  1917, the yearly burden of interest of the National Debt had  swallowed 22 &quot;5 per cent, of Italy&apos;s national property. Under such circumstances, the recovery of Italian currency can only be ascribed to manipulations of securities.&quot;  (07. Report No. 87.)                                     JAPAN.     New  Cabinet. The  Japanese  Embassy   announces  that  a  new  Japanese Cabinet was formed on September 29th  under the -Premiership of Mr.  Kei Hara, leader of the Seiyukai  (Constitutional) Party.   It is constituted as  follows :          Mr. Kei Hara   -       -      -  Prime Minister and Minister of Justice.         Viscount Yasuya Uchida      -   Foreign Affairs.         Mr. Takejiro Tokonami        -  Home Affairs.         Baron Korekiyo Takahashi     -   Finance.         Mr. Tokugoro Nakahashi      -  Education.         Mr. Yamanroto       -        -  Agriculture and Commerce.         Mr. Utaro Noda       -         Communications.         Lieut.-(ion. Giichi Tanaka     -  War.         Admiral Kato       -        -  Navy.     The new Minister of War has hitherto been Deputy  Chief of the General Staff,and Viscount Uchida is  the ex-Ambassador to Russia.   Admiral Kato retains  theoffice which he held in the  late Cabinet of Count Terauchi.  (For an appreciation seeThe Times of October 1st  at page 7.)  Sir C. Greene points out that the attitude ofMr. Hara aud his party regarding intervention in Siberia has hitherto been (to say theleast) one of reserve, whilst Viscount Uchida has shown himself definitely opposed tosuch intervention, and, indeed, somewhat inclined towards Bolshevism.

Economic Conditions anal the Control of Imports. A report received (M.T., 6 .B.,No. 727) from a reliable source reveals unsatisfactory features in the general internalcondition of Portugal.  An attempt is being made to put the country on rations, butthe scheme appears to be doomed  to  failure owing  to fraud and profiteering whichare met with on every side.  The  dry weather has  resulted in  a  great shortage ofturnips and  potatoes, which form the staple  diet  of the poor in  winter,  and muchdistress is anticipated in consequence.   The situation  is aggravated  by the fact that ships which might bring grain from  Africa  appear to  be more frequently employedin carrying rubber  and cocoa,  which are  not essential  to  the country, and  whichpresumably are conveyed through the influence and to  the profit of  certain,  firms and individuals, possibly in German interests.  It is  in fact stated that no less  than amillion hags of sugar are secretly stored  in  various  places, as well as very  large supplies of rubber  and cocoa.   Insufficient attention appears to  be paid to recom-mendations in respect of import  licences, with the result that undesirable.firms haveno difficulty in importing such important articles as coal and  tinplate.                      UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA.     Termination of Allied Military Missions : Representation of British Air Service. -Mr. Barclay reports that the United-States authorities have decided to dispense with the services of all foreign officers at present employed for training purposes wdth theUnited States Army, and to replace them  by American  officers from  Europe.  It  isnot  yet  certain  whether  or  to what  extent this decision will affect  the  BritishAviation Mission, but Mr.  Barclay submits  that in any  case the appointment of an air Attache is now  desirable.     i see also under &quot; Brazil,&quot; &quot; China,&quot;  and &quot; Peace Discussions.&quot;)ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    The Subject Nationalities. A Memorandum (G.T.  5794, dated  September  18th)by the  P.I.D.  discusses the  rumoured  schemes for  federalisation of  Austria bydividing her into four national States, German,  Czech,  Jugo-Slav,  and Polish..  TheNeue  Freie Presse of August 31st suggests that some such scheme  was proposed  toBaron von Hussarek by &quot; a savant of high rank &quot; (probably either Professor Lammaschor Dr. Redlich), but that von Hussarek refused to touch it.   In a speech delivered onSeptember 11th he declared that there are two  limits to constitutional reform  un austria &quot;respect for the rights and constitution of Hungary, and  the  determination to preserve the idea of the United Austrian State.&quot;  In  other words, this &quot; reform &quot;can give neither reunion nor statehood to the Czecho-Slovaks  and  Jugo-Slavs.   The-
sGerman-Austrians and Magyars regard &quot;reform&quot; of this  nature as constitutionallyimpracticable,  ddre Czechs attach no importance to it, and declare that  the  time for negotiations with the Vienna Government is long past.     &quot; No constitutional  reform within the boundaries of Austria is  possible.   Eventhe widest degree  of autonomy by itself  would not  satisfy the Czechs  or  the Jugo-Slavs, who aspire to national unity, and national unity would imply  the  break-up ofthe Hungarian State,  ddre Poles would  gain nothing because  they  are  anyhow themasters of Galicia, but what they aim at  is reunion with Russian Poland.   Shouldany attempt be made to liberate East Galicia from Polish dominion, the  Poles  wouldonce more come out in the sharpest opposition, but if East Galicia is definitely handedover to them under a scheme of federalisation, nothing would be left to the Ukrainiansof  that  country but revolution.  The Germans  naturally would never agree  to  afederalisatiou of Austria  whereby the Germans of Bohemia would become a  minority in a Czech State  and the Germans  of the  Southern Provinces  be  cut  off from the adriatic.  It is a matter of comparative indifference  to them whether their Austria isbeing broken  up  under the Ilabsburg  sceptre or  by  the Entente.  The Magyarswould never agree to a federalisation of Austria which on their borders would createself-governing States, centres of irredentism  for the non-Magyar nations of Hungary.It seems, therefore, unlikely that these schemes  are  meant  seriously  by anybody wdrodeserves  being taken seriously.  In  so  far  as they are not merely a symptom ofthe complete  chaos in  Vienna Government circles,  they  were  probably meant  as  a prelude to the Peace Note.&quot;     A report (which may be read in the light of the above considerations) has  beenreceived by  the  Foreign Office to  the effect that Austria&apos;s attitude regarding the bulgarian move wdll be  partly determined by the success or faibire of an attempt to reconcile  the subject nationalities  by the formation of a  coalition Cabinet containingCzech and Southern Slav members.     According to a  further report, the Tyrolese peasants  are now anxious to  escape from their  present intolerable disorganisation by incorporation with.  Germany.  It issuggested that the Germans are  likely before long  to  occupy Vienna.   They wouldthen agree to the independence of Bohemia, trusting  to  the strength of  the Germanelement in that province.  Hungary would  maintain itself.  It  is  added that CountTisza is now disposed to favour the creation of a Jugo-Slav State with the reservationsthat Hungary should retain the Banat  and that Fiume should  be made  a free port ;he  is,  however, entirely opposed  to  any scheme  of  Slovak  independence.   (SeeReport  No.  S4,  and  under  &quot; Italy &quot; ; also a speech made  by Baron  Hussarek on1st October,  quoted in The Times of October 3rd at page 10.)     Austrian  Financial Situation. ddre Admiralty reports : ddre official  view ofAustria&apos;s financial position may be gathered from the Report of the Budget Committeeof the Austrian Upper House,  published  on August 17th.   For the year 19.17-18 theexpenditure, it is stated,  will  amount to nearly 74-6,000,000L,  to -cover which sum,together with a number  of other payments such as war bonuses to civil servants, &amp;c,votes of credit wdll be sanctioned to the extent of 840,000,0001.  Of  the total  amountof  just  over  100,000?000Z. in  respect  of interest  on the public debt, 52,4OO,00OZ. isunprovided   for and is  to be  included  in the total for 1918-19.   Tire Commit.tee&apos;sReport describes the financial situation of the country as  extraordinarily serious.   Itcharacterises as vicious  the  system of heaping debts upon debts instead of making-provision for interest payments by means of new sources  of revenue.   Although the justice of these strictures is  beyond clispjute, the inability of the Austrian Governmentto carry out the necessary financial  reforms by the imposition of adequate taxation  ismanifest.    ddie amount  of paper money &quot;in circulation had risen roughly  from 80,000,000Z. before the  war  to 960,000,000&apos;/, at the  end of August,  During the 12 months  ending on August 31st there was an increase of 400,00O,OO0L  ddre effect  of this policy  has been  to create an artificial rise in prices,  involving new expenditure and. the raising of further credits.  In  neutral countries the krone has sunk to half its former value ; and even in  Berlin, where the exchange  rate has been fixed  by agree- ment for some months,  there has  been a depreciation.                                   GERMANY.     Political  Situation  and  Prospects. dffie Foreign  Office  is  informed  that on September  28th serious peace riots took  place in Berlin. . Statues were broken, and a mob cheered in  front  of  the Bulgarian  Degation, which Avas being  protected by
soldiers.  Reports agree that very considerable depression prevails in Germany.  Theeducated  classes would  appear to be slowly realising the truth.   The lower classes are exhausted and apathetic, but still persuaded  that Germany will hold  out.  TheAllied air raids  are having a great moral  effect,  which would, in the opinion of oneinformant, be very much enhanced if they could be directed against Prussian cities. ,    A rescript  from the  Kaiser  accepting the resignation of  Count PPertling (seeGerman Wireless  of  October 1st) concludes as follows: &quot; I wish that  the Germannation shall take a more active  part than hitherto in  determining the fate of theFatherland.  It  is therefore my wish that men who are supported, by the  trust of thenation shall participate to a greater extent in the righteous duties of the Government.I beg of you that you will conclude your  labours  by going on wdth the conduct  ofaffairs and prepare  the way for the measures which 1 desire, until I have found  yoursuccessor.   I look forward to your proposals to this effect.&quot; . German Wireless of thesame  date further  states: &quot;The Main  Committee  of  the Reichstag  met  in  the afternoon of September  30th.   Immediately after the opening  of the sitting Vice-Chancellor  von  Payer  read  the  KaiseFs  decree  concerning  Count  He.rtlirig&apos;resignation, and added that the whole of the German people would be grateful to the kaiser for his resolution with  regard to effective co-operation in the busiifess of theGovernment and that the  KaiseFs wish would  be fulfilled  in  the shortest  possibletime.   The  fractions would  negotiate  with the Governments representatives  that very  day on the question of  participation in  the Cabinet.  The Committee  thenadjourned.&quot;  Berlin telegrams speak of the resignation of all the State Secretaries.    Herr Hans  Delbruck  is   stated  to  have  expressed the  view that  on CountHertling&apos;s  retirement the military party  might endeavour to establish a dictatorshipunder Ludendorff.  Delbruck is said to consider that such an expedient would resultin the expulsion both of Ludendorff and  the German Emperor from the country in three  months&apos; time.  The alternative to a dictatorship  would be the appointment asChancellor of Solf, Bernstorff, Rantzau or Fehrenbach (see Report No. 87;.   germany would then  be prepared to  cede Belgium and the  occupied parts of France ; she would never give up  Alsace, but might, perhaps,  yield  Metz *and  consent  to  a.condominium in the Lorraine mining district.  The Brest Treaty would be  revised ona  basis of strict self-determination, but no German territory in the East could be abandoned,  and  the pre-war Eastern  frontier  must be maintained.  Germany wouldbe prepared  to abandon Turkey  and would look  to the Portuguese  possessions for compensation in colonies and raw  material.    A Berlin telegram   to  the  Kolnische  (quoted in  an Amsterdam  message,&apos;September   28th)   sa3;s  that  the  National-Liberal   Fraction   has  published   a programme in which, under  the  head &quot; Home Policy,&quot; it declares in favour of the entry into the Government of  further representatives  of the various parties,  whoare ready to share  responsibility, to  which  end Article  IX.,  paragraph  2,  and article XXL, paragraph 2, of the Constitution must be abolished.   The  unity ofthe Government is to be secured by  guaranteeing  the  permanent participation ofState  Secretaries in the-direction  of  affairs  and  the entire policy  of  the  country,and  by  the regulating  of  the  participation  of appropriate  organic  institutions,particularly  by  joint  sittings and  decisions.  Unity  must   also  be  established between  the Government aud  the  responsible  military  authorities.  The  Partyfurther demands a thorough reform of the Foreign Office and of the Foreign Service,the speedy regulation of the  Prussian Suffrage in accordance with the government bill and the introduction of legislation, when the Reichstag meets, to regulate questions connected with martial  law,  particularly  as regards the censorship arid the right of association and meeting.   The programme goes on to  say :  &quot; The regulation of theState form which Alsace-Lorraine is to  take  is  declared  to be an internal Germanaffair, on which, however, a decision must be taken immediately.  In  the  occupiedEastern  territories the military must be converted into  a civil administration.&quot;  Asregards  its  foreign policy, the Party is ready to conclude peace on the  basis of the integrity of  German territory and  the &quot;return  of her colonies.  It declares for theeconomic and political restoration of Belgium, while  demanding guarantees of a realneutrality and.of  the internal, social, and political autonomy of  the Flemish people.It  does  not depart from its well-known attitude regarding the Eastern Border States,advocating the speedy realisation of the close political,  economic, and military unionof the Baltic lands and of Lithuania wdth Germany, and it  declares that  the &quot; world peace must not endanger this result.&quot;  The Party then welcomes the idea of  a Leagueof Nations to prevent future wars by arbitration courts and a simultaneous restriction     mm-ib                             c
of armaments, adding that economic war must be excluded.  The above programme was voted unanimously at the last sitting of the National Liberal Parly.    Un  September  24th the Reichstag  Social Democrats and  the executive of  theGerman  Social Democratic Party at a  joint meeting resolved  to  allow  members oftheir party to take office in the new Government,  An official announcement lays down the following as the conditions :- (1) Acceptance of the Reichstag resolution of July  19th,  1917,  the League  of  Rations,  and universal  disarmament.   (2) ddierestoration of Belgium with  indemnification and  also  the restoration  of  Serbia andMontenegro.   (3) &quot;Neither  the  Brest-Litovsk  nor the Bucharest  treaty  must be  ahindrance to universal peace.  On the conclusion of peace the occupied regions mustbe  immediately surrendered.   Democratic  representation must be  established  as speedily as possible.   (4)  Autonomy  for  Alsace-Lorraine.   Universal  secret and direct franchise for  all German  Federal States.   Immediate  dissolution  of  the prussian Diet if equal franchise does not ensue from the discussions in the Committeeof the Upper House.   (J)) Unity in Imperial Government.  Appointment  of  Govern-ment representatives  from  the  Parliamentary  majority.  Publications of the crown and military  authorities  to be communicated to  the Chancellor before issue.   (6) ddieimmediate abolition  of  all restrictions on  the freedom  of assembly and the Press.ddie Censorship only to  be applied to purely military questions,  ddie abolition of all military institutions exerting political influence.     German  Wireless of  September 28th  reports : &quot; With regard to the Minoritydemands of   the  Social Democratic  Reichstag  Fraction  regarding  the  eventualtaking over of direct responsibility for State affairs by  the entry of Social Democratsinto the  Government, the Social Democratic Internationale Korresponclenz writes : &apos; But one has to be careful against the error of regarding a note for a specific purpose as a complete  labour programme of the Social Democrats.  In the peace question wehave  only included those questions which we address to the bourgeois  parties and tothe German Government, in order to  do away with all obstacles to peace,  but we havenever mentioned  our demands to  the  enemy.   The  re-establishment of  Serbia,therefore, does not mean any renunciation of  the just national demands  of  Bulgaria,and the  fact that the  Colonies have not been mentioned does not by any means mean that we abandon them.&apos; &quot;     German  Wireless of  the same  date reports: &quot;The Main  Committee of  theReichstag  met  on the morning of September 27th for further discussions on thepolitical situation, following upon  the report of the State Secretary  for Foreign affairs on the 26th  regarding the Bulgarian armistice offer,   due  interfractional discussions which took place in  the evening  dealt wdth  the cancellation of paragraph 9 of theState Constitution, regarding the entry of Reichstag representatives into  the Govern-inent, as well as with the autonomy of Alsace-Lorraine.  The leading Centre organ,Germania, emphasises the  obvious efforts of the Government to meet the just  demandsof the Reichstag.   The  recognition of the  Payer programme and the renunciation ofa close union of the  Baltic States  wdth Prussia may be booked as noticeable  progressby the Government in the direction of  the policy of  the Majority Parties.  Moreover,it will lie with Parliament Itself to co-operate in an  alteration  of  the  state of  siegelaws.&quot;  (See also The Times of  October 3rd at page 8.)     The D.U. reports: &quot; According  to  an  Amsterdam,  wire  (September 23rd) the  Ngrcldeiitsche Allgemeine Zeitung publishes  an  article on  &quot;Parliament  and. Government,&quot; which is of particular  interest  at the  present  moment,  when  there is so  much  talk in  Germany of  &quot; parliainentarisation,&quot; as illustrating the view held by- the  Government.  The Norddeutsche, as  quoted by the  HheiniscIiAVcstfdlische Zeitung, says: &apos; Hitherto  it was an undisputed  principle of our  policy  and. our State law  that in doubtful questions  the decision was in the hands of the Monarch, and  not of  Parliament,  The  Monarch stands for  unity of conception  and will  in quite a different  way  from wdiat  any Parliament  in Germany  could  do.   The former state  of affairs wdth  us, when  these  two authorities were directly  opposed, and  did not  check each other, has been changed during the war.  The Government of officials appointed by the  Kaiser has  taken parliamentarian blood into its  body. Now, as before,  the Monarch has  the de facto right  of  appointment,  whilst  the responsible  government is working in constant accord  with the will of Parliament. There is no reason to go beyond, this.  Precisely  because our Parliament&apos;is  divided on the ground of  social, cultural, economic, and religious considerations, and  because of the  possibility of forming  a  majority in  the most various  ways,  the Imperial GoArernment cannot become dependent on a definite majority.  It has to secure for
itself the confidence of the greatest possible part of Parliament, and must do  so  everanew.   Then, in co-operation with the Crown, it can pursue its task for the  welfare of the  whole.   From actual  daily events  we see that the Governments policyrequires for its realisation the broadest possible basis in Parliament.  This is themeaning of the German parliamentary system.   Coercion  by  a definite majorityGovernment, such as results from  a. completely different  party  life in other States,would be fatal in the conditions which prevail in Germany.&apos; &quot;     A. competent neutral observer, lately.returned from Germany, confirms the viewrecorded in.recent reports that the end is not  yet  in sight, and that these ostensiblydemocratic developments are at present mere camouflage for  the Kaiser  and his-clique.     German Interests in Alsace. A reliable source reports  (vide M.I. 6 B., No.  728)that the German Government  is anxious for the greatest possible number of Germancapitalists to interest themselves in  the purchase of French properties in Alsace, witha view to the further Germanisation  of  that country.  All deeds  of sale are  supple-mentecl by a clause stipulating that  in  cases where the purchaser cannot enter  intopossession of the property, the money he has spent will be given back  to him in theform of War Loan Bonds.NEUTRAL GROUP.                                    CHILE.    Attitude towards the War. SirF. Stronge reports that the recent Allied successeshave produced a great impression in Chile, and opinion is more and more incliningtowards the Allied camp.   On September 27th a  number of influential Chileans held a meeting to discuss the bringing about of  closer relations with the  United States.Sehor Tocornal, formerly Minister  for Foreign Affairs, proposed a  resolution,  whichthe meeting accepted, that Chile should pursue  a foreign policy in. accordance withthe declarations of President Wilson.   The  Committee wdll again  meet in the nearfuture to consider a proposal of a more far-reaching character.   Sir F.  Stronge isdoubtful whether any very decided action, will be taken unless in.  consultation withthe Argentine Government.  An Admiralty report notes the  presence of  a ChileanMission at Buenos Aires.    German Ships  in  Chilean Ports. Sir F.  Stronge  reports   that  the  chilean government has  taken action  regarding the German ships in Chilean waters  (seeReports  Eos. 84-86) by  placing a military guard  upon  three which were recentlyunder negotiation for charter (including the Memphis,  which was  interned),  andalso upon the Nitohris, which has  been found to  be undamaged.   Special measuresmay also possibly be taken,  in respect of the remaining four interned ships, thoughaccording to the Chilean Foreign Minister, these would  require at  least six  months to repair.                                  DENMARK.    German Conditions for Supply of Shipbuilding Material. A.  sure source reports(vide M.I. 6 B, No. 72S) that the conditions  imposed by Germauy for  the supply of iron to  Denmark for shipbuilding purposes  include  the  following :-&quot;-(!)  Shipsconstructed wdth German iron shall not be put in commission during the war, except under special limitations ; (2)  Germany reserves the right of chartering such ships at an  agreed  price  for  four  years after the war;  and (3) also  the right of buyingtheni in the same period for  cash at  the current rates.  To  make  these  conditionseffective  various stringent guarantees  are  required  from  the  importers.  .  ThreeDanish yards  at least are stated to  have  accepted  these stipulations.

                                   FINLAND.     Partial Withdrawal of German Troops. The Foreign Office learns from a goodsource that three-fourths of the German troops in the Viborg area  are  being with-drawn from the country.  They are being informed that their destination is Palestine,but fear they are in fact being  sent to the Western front, and are much dissatisfied.     Von Hintze on  the  Finnish  Constitution. On  September  24th, in the main committee of the Reichstag,  Admiral  von Hiutze (according to  Daily Review ofSeptember 27th) made the  following observations  in regard  to Finland:-&quot;In theNorth one of the States which evoke our  special interest Finland took the first step towards its political  consolidation.  As early as May this year General Mannerheimdeclared,  at Pielsingfors that the restoration of  the  monarchy must bo the foundation of  F:iuland&apos;s   prosperity.   The  Finnish  law  provides  that  Finland  shall  be  amonarchical  State.  The State Administrator, M. Svinhufvud,  declared  about thesame time towards the end  of  May that  the only way to safeguard  the independence and  freedom  of  Finland was a firm-constitutional  monarchy  standing above partydisputes.  I  have very specially emphasised that  in  order  to show what basis themotiarchy in Finland  has, foreseeing the allegation that we haA^e been trying to force (a) monarchy on Finland.  That  was not  the case.   The  Finnish Government  subse-quently turned to Germany with the request for a  Prince  of the  Royal House, a son of the Kaiser, as  monarch.   The Kaiser for various reasons felt himself disinclined tocomply with this request.   The  Finnish Government was told, that the question ofState form is  the Finnish Governments own  affair.   The draft Constitution whichthe  Finnish  Government  thereupon  prepared,  in which  monarchical   support isprovided, was  not disposed  of at  the first  reading, as the majority for  an urgentdebate, which is prescribed  by  the  Constitution, w?as lacking.  On the ground  of thelaw of 1772, fresh measures were then undertaken  by the  Government, the object ofwhich was to give Finland  a State form congenial to it.  At  the wish of  the finnish government,  we had  a  semi-official declaration   made  through our Minister  inHelsingfors that any interference by us in the  matter of the Constitution was out ofthe question, but that the retention  of the Constitution  providing for a constitutionalmonarchy would, of course, be greeted with sympathy in Germany.&quot;     German Economic Interference. The  following information  has been received(M.I. 6 B., Nos. 725 and 726) regarding  German economic interference in Finland.Every peasant possessing a cow has to supply 1 kilo of butter to German Governmentagents appointed to collect it.  Failing such supply, the cow is sequestrated.   Abouta million kilos are so collected weekly.  Eo peasant may sell or kill his cattle without permission from  the  authorities.   Apart from butter, metals,  wool,  linen, soap, &amp;c,vdiieh go only to Germany, no exports are permitted.  Of  the grain,  sugar and petroleum promised, by the Germans, the Finns have seen but little.   When theGermans entered Helsingfors on April. 17th they at once forbade the sale  of clothing and woven goods ; these had to be declared, and, pending arrangements for rationing,an inventory of stocks was taken.  The  rationing  arrangements  have not yet beenmade and the  stocks are still unsold, with the  exception of  some of  the  silk goods which have been licensed for sale.  (And see Reports Nos.  84-87.)     Supplies for Swedish Subjects. Mr.  Clive reported on September 23rd that theSwedish Government had made representations to the French  Minister regarding thefood  shortage from which Swedish subjects in. Finland were suffering.   In  compliancewdth the  stipulations  of  the Swedish agreement,   the  consent of  the   associated governments  w-as requested to  the export of  certain quantities of flour  and  sugar,consigned to the Swedish Legation at Helsingfors  for  distribution to  these  personswho  number about 5,000.  The Allied. Ministers are recommending  their respective governments to agree to this.     His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Consulate. His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consul  at Helsing-for s  reported on September 25th that  the Consular shield which had been defaced (seeReport No. 86) had now been restored and replaced.

Findlay  reportedthat the Norwegian  Government had instructed  its  representatives  in  London,Washington, Paris, and Berlin that in view, of  repeated  infringements of  norwegian territorial waters by submarines, it had now been decided to supplement the measures already taken by laying mines, care being taken that peaceful commercial  shippingalong the Norwegian  coast should not  be stopped.  Sir M. Findlay has reason tobelieve  that this  action will be  effective,   ddre  Norwegian&apos; Government appears tohave satisfied itself that there is no  risk of trouble with Germany in the matter.    The Norwegian Admiralty has now  announced the position of a minefield  to belaid in Norwegian,  territorial, waters, for which  purpose these waters  will be closed to ordinary traffic from October 7th.  Tdre announcement is cpuoted without comment by german Wireless of October 2nd.    (See cdso Reports Nos. 80-S2, Sd, and 87.)    Spitsbergen. According to Press reports, the  British dag has been hoisted atEbeltoft harbour in Spitsbergen, and the German  wireless station destroyed.  (this action has been taken by the Northern Exploration Company  upon its own initiative.)(See  also  The  Times of October  3rd, at page  8,  and  Reports  Nos. 60-62, 75and 78.)                               NETHERLANDS.    Dutch-Allied Commercial Negotiations.- Sir W. Townley  reports that,  he has informed  the  Netherlands  Foreign  Minister  of  the  opinion  of  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  that London  would be  the  most suitable  place  for the resumption ofcommercial  negotiations.-  ddie Foreign Minister is still awaiting the  views of theFrench, Italian, and United States Governments.    Mr.  Robertson reports that the  communique of the United States Governmentthrowing  responsibility for the Dutch food shortage  upon the  Netherlands Govern-ment  (see Report No. 87) has provoked the Neue Fotterdamsche Courant to reopen thewdrole question of the requisition of Dutch tonnage; he deprecates further referenceto the subject.    German-Dutch Commercial Negotiations. Mr. Robertson reports that commercial negotiations  between Holland and Germany, which  were interrupted  in July  (seeReports Nos. 78, 80 and 83), are about to  be  resumed.   It appears that Germany isvery anxious to obtain (inter alia.) bone-grease, and  is for this purpose prepared tosupply benzine for the  degreasing  of bones in Holland, and  also .to  place at thedisposal of Holland for export to the Allies a quantity of glycerine equivalent to theamount of bone-grease  supplied.  With regard  to foodstuffs, Mr. Robertson observesthat there are not any considerable quantities in  Holland available for export.    6633-n-                           aMexican situation as serious, and that in the. circumstances it  is not advisable thathe should visit Washington.  Mr, Thurstan adheres to his opinion that the situationpresents dangerous features.   (And see Report No. 87.)     Mexico and  France. Mr. Thurstan reports that the Mexican Government  isinsisting on  a  definite reply regarding  the  acceptance  of  the  Mexican  Minister-designated for Paris.

                                    SPAIN.    Attitude towards German Submarine Campaign. According to the Daily &quot;Reviewof September 27th, Admiral von  Hintze,  speaking on September 24th in the main committee of the Reichstag said : &quot; Of other neutral States Spain came  forward, inAugust with a demand which surprised us.  It desired to take into  its service untilthe arrival of peace, against an appropriate payment, one of the German ships internedin the  Spanish,  ports for each Spanish  ship  sunk.  That was a  demand, which wecould  not grant.   Had we done&apos; so we should to a certain extent have crippled ourU-boat war.  Remembering, however, that in the course of the  war Spain renderedsubstantial service to Germany and Germans abroad, we are  grateful to  Spain ; weshould, like to  show  our  gratitude to  Spain.   We have  therefore  offered Spaincertain concessions, not relative to the ships sunk in the  barred zone, but  relative tosuch as suffer this fate outside the barred zone.  For each such ship we would beready to  band over for the duration of  the war and. against proper compensation oneof our ships interned  in Spain.  We have  requested Spain  to  send  experts  here for negotiations  regarding the application  of  the  safe-conduct system  to Spanishships.  It seems that Spain is inclined to do this.&quot;    On September 23rd Mr. Vaughan. reported that Senor Dato wras awaiting certain information from  the Ambassadors in London and  Paris,  subject to which  it was his intention, in view of  the unsatisfactory character of the German proposals, to request the German Ambassador to designate  two ships, failing  which the Spanish  Govern-ment itself would select two for seizure.   On  September  24th  Mr. Vaughan reportedthat the Spanish  Ambassador at  Berlin wras  to remain  at his post  until the  crisisshould have been  settled.   On  September 25th Mr. Vaughan  reported an allegedGerman design to  bribe  Spanish  pilots to lose Allied  ships   by grounding orcollision;   the matter  has been  brought to  the  knowledge  of  Senor Dato and ofthe British  Consular   Officers.    On  September 28th Mr.  Vaughan reported  thatthere had been some dispute between, the  Ministers of War and  Marine (the former-being a supporter of Sejror  Dato) in regard to  jurisdiction at naval bases.   The matter was brought to a head  by the issue through the military authorities at Carthagena ofcertain orders affecting the navy, possibly in connection with preparations  for seizure of  a German ship.   On October 1st Mr. Vaughan reported that a  final  resolutionregarding  seizure had been fixed to  take place in  Madrid on  October  3rd ;  this,however,  had again been  postponed by  reason of Sen or Dato&apos;s inability  to leaveSantander owing  to the indisposition of the King.                                   SWEDEN.    German  Mines in  the  Skagefack  and  &quot;Kattegat.  Mr. Olive reports that  onSeptember 24th the Swedish mine-sweeper  Gunhild  struck a  mine off  Skagen andWras blown up.   Of 29  men, 20  were killed  and four wounded.   It is believed thatthe mine was one of those newly laid by the Germans.  Stockholm^ Tidning contains a very bitter article on this incident, expressing the belief that the mine was Germanand voicing the horror felt in Sweden at such  occurrences.  It is  stated that theGerman Naval Attache has personally expressed to the Swedish  Minister of Marine the deep regret of the  German Naval Authorities.   The Swedish Press of September 27threports that  the  Swedish fishing-boat  Arthur, wdth  four men on board, has  been lost, probably in the same waters as the  Gunhild ; it is believed that she struck &quot;on aGerman  mine.   The Gdteborgs Postcn of  September 80th reports  that on September18th  the  Gunhild observed two German  destroyers and a torpedo boat, engaged inlaying mines.   (See also Reports No. 69, 71, 72, 76,  and 87.)    Cereals. According  to  information furnished by the Food  Commission to theSvenska Dagbladel, the harvest is now expected to yield 929.000 tons of bread cereals,i.e., 329,000  tons  in excess  of the original  estimate.  The Socialist papier Arbetetstates that the ration will  be increased from  200  to 250 grammes of Hour per  day from  November,  and to 300 grammes  early next year.  As yet, however, the FoodCommission has made no official statement regarding  the ration.    (And see under &quot; Finland.&quot;)
SWITZERLAND.    Supplies to and from Switzerland. The economic agreement between. Switzerlandand  the United  States  expired  on September 30th,  and  negotiations for a new agreement  will shortly be  opened.  The United States Government is prepared to share wdth His  Majesty&apos;s  Government the  responsibility of supplying Switzerlandwith  sufficient shipping to cany 50,00.0 tons  of imported  supplies monthly.  TheUnited  States Government will endeavour  to  secure supplies of Swiss timber andSwiss &quot;credits for  financing Allied purchases  in Switzerland; it has  intimated,  itsreadiness to  receive  particulars  of  British requirements in this regard.   (And  seeReports Nos. 70, 72-74, 77, 78, 82 and  85.)    (See also under &quot; Italy.&quot;)                                  URUGUAY.     Attitude towards  the War. Mr.  Mitchell Innes  reports  that the  UruguayanForeign Minister, who is  personally disposed  to favour a declaration of war  againstGermany, has intimated that his Government is inclining in the same direction,[The  Uruguayan  Government  severed  diplomatic   relations  with  Germany  onOctober 7th, 1917.]PEACE DISCUSSIONS.(N.B.  Countries are arranged in alphabetical order under this heading.)                          NOTE ON PEACE DISCUSSIONS.    A precis of President Wilsoris &quot; Fourteen Point Speech,&quot; of January 8th, 1918, towhich constant references are now being made in peace  overtures and propaganda,will be found in an Appendix  to Western Report No. 50, which also contains a precisof Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s  speech delivered on  January 5th:   Count Hertling&apos;s detailedreplies to those two speeches will be found in an Appendix to Report No. 53.   CountCzerniiPs replies are given in an Appendix to Report No. 54.    These  Appendices contain some  matter which may be found of interest at  thepresent stage, especially in so  far as  they show a line of cleavage between AustrcLHungarian and. German expressions  of their war aims, and a still sharper diverg-ncebetween their protestations and their  actions, as since exemplified by the Brest andBucharest treaties and the subsequent interpretation of those treaties.    A precis of President Wilsons  Congress speech of February 11th is given as an appendix to Report No. 5G.   On that occasion the President summarised and com-mented upon, the  British,  German, and Austro-Hungarian views.   Attached to ReportNo. 53 will be found a precis of Count Hertling&apos;s speech of February 25th, in whichhe confessed that economic development in  every direction had been the German waraim  &quot;from the  beginning.&quot;   The  same Appendix contains Baron  de Broqueville&apos;reply to Count Hertling  that  the Belgian  Government would only discuss peace in concert wdth those of the Powers  which had honoured  their engagements towardsBelgium.   Extracts from President WilsoiPs last speech are given  in. this  report under United States on page  18.    General. The effect of military successes has been to open out prospects of the collapse  of  the Quadruple Alliance, . from which Bulgaria  is  now  detached  bythe terms  of  the  armistice.  There are strong rumours that Turkey will shortly
follow suit in opening peace overtures  independently, and  that Austria-Hungary will follow before long.     Austria-Hungary. According to information which has reached  the ForeignOffice through Count  de Salis (Vatican, September 28th) the Dutch Government  hasbeen asked  by Austria whether negotiations for peace might be conducted  at TheHague.  (See also under Holland).     Sir  If.  Rumbold  (September 28th)  reports  on  good  authority  that Germanyopposed  the proposal  to despatch the Vienna Note, which was sent out  in spite ofGermany&apos;s disapproval.     From information  received from  Mr. Robertson  (The Hague,  September 28th-29th) and Sir H. Rum bold (September 29th) it seems  probable that Austria-Hungarywill not always submit to German dictation,  and, if unable to come to an  agreement,will make overtures for peace on  the basis of President Wilsons fourteen principles.There is an impression in Austria  that the Germans wdll give way.     Bulgaria. After numerous  premonitory symptoms  (Reports  by Lord Derby,September  25tli-29th, Sir H. Ruinbold, September 26th-28th, Mr. CLve,  Stockholm,September  27th, Lord  Granville, September 28th-29th,  Mr. Robertson, September28th-29th, and Sir R.  Rodd, September  29th). an armistice has  been signed with bulgaria, and hostilities ceased at  noon on September 30th.   (Sir C.  des Graz, Corfu,September 30th).     Lord Derby (September 29fh) reports official announcements in the French press that no diplomatic negotiations are being  conducted with  Bulgaria,  and  no political conditions offered to her.  [For the military conditions sec Eastern Report.  Some ofthem were published, in The Times of October 1st.1  Further details were supplied byLord Derby on September  30th.   The military  conditions  are somewhat  similar tothose imposed upon Rumania  by Germany, but  without the annexations  and veiledindemities.]     German Wireless of September 27th -30th is full of references to  the  Bulgarianarmistice, which show that. Germany was kept in the dark by Bulgaria.     Russian Wireless of September 30th reported  an &quot; official proposal for peace withthe Entente &quot; made by Bulgaria.     According  to  a  report  received  from Mr.  Robertson (September  28th)  the bulgarians had made it clear to Austria and  to Bavaria that they would  make peacebefore the end of the winter, but the King wras  not  expected to  take  independentaction before the close of the current month.     German Wireless of October  1st published, from  Isvestia of September 29th, an account of  alleged secret negotiations  for peace  between  the Entente and Bulgariasince January 1917,  The  Entente are  said to  have promised Bulgaria Kavalla,Drama, Seres, the island of Thasus (sic), the town of  Adrianople, and territory in theline Enos-Midia.     Belgium. The Belgian Government  have  expressed  to the  Foreign Office theirviews upoii the national status desired by Belgium when peace is established.   Aninternational position of complete independence  is indicated.     France. On September 28th, Lord Derby reported warnings in the French Press-to exercise great care in dealing wdth an adversary so treacherous as King Ferdinand.(See  also under Bulgaria and Turkey.)   On  October 1st  Lord  Derby  added  thatliveliest  satisfaction  was   expressed in  the  French Press  about  the Bulgarianarmistice.      Germany. Seems to have been  kept in the dark by Bulgaria during the events.leading  up  to the armistice.   (See under Bulgaria.)      Reports  from The Hague (September 27th) and  Copenhagen  (September 28th)indicate the probability that Germany wdll make a  strong bid  for intervention byneutrals (see last weelPs Report), using the hardships undergone by neutrals as a lever,, but in Sir R. Paget&apos;s opinion the rumours that the meeting of the Scandinavian Kings at  Copenhagen had been engineered  by Germany with this  object in view are withoutfoundation.  (See cdso under Holland.)A fuller report, received, via Milan, is given in The Times of October 3rd.
    There have been indications for some time of  a  rapprochement between Bavariaand Austria on the question of peace overtures, and continuation of these rumours isto be found in a report from Mr. Robertson of September 28th.    From a  report (September  29th) from Mr. Robertson, based upon  an authoritygenerally  reliable, Germany will yield, in the opinion of the Austrians, and agree tothe opening of peace overtures.    The  Ministry of Information Intelligence Department (September 28th) providea summary  of the  propaganda value in Germany and in neutral- countries  of  the vienna Note.    German Wireless of  September 26th October 2nd  is  full  of  peace  propa-ganda  and  League  of Nations proposals.   September 20th  refers  to  the &quot; greatspeech &quot; of the Foreign Minister, von Hintze [who  has since retired].    Great satisfaction is expressed in  German Wireless (September 29th) at reportsof the  yearly conference  of  the Scottish Labour  Party in Glasgow, referring withspecial pleasure to Mr. Philip Snowclen and Ramsay Macdonald.  :;ddre  Daily Review of  September  26th-27th contains  useful  precis  of  Pressopinions  and  the attitude  of the public and of publicists in Germany towards peace proposals.    (See aho under Germany on page 8 for future  possibilities in peace offers.)    Great Britain. No sufficient reason has as yet been put before the Foreign office in favour  of a collective reply by the Allies to the Vienna  Peace Note.   (F.O. 1481 ofOctober 1st.)    In reporting  for  the  week ending on September 25th, the Ministry of Labourstates : &quot; The receipt of the Austrian  peace note has  given an impetus  to  thediscussion of  the peace question, which largely excludes  other  topics.   Most  papersstart with the  thesis that Germany is beaten and  knows it, though their conclusionsdiverge.   The pacifist papers naturally demand immediate  negotiations.&quot;    Lord Derby was  informed on the evening of September 30th that the BritishGovernment had not as yet heard the-exact nature of the terms of the armistice with bulgaria.   M. Clemenceau ou the same  day forwarded a precis of the terms.    Holland. According to  a report received from Mr. Robertson (September  27th),if neutrals should combine to suggest intervention  (see under Germany above) Hollandwould not stand out, but would be the last to join  such  a combination.    Queen  Wilhelmina is  reported  by German  AVireless (October 1st)  on Pressauthority  to have  placed  her residence at the  disposal of the Austro-HungarianCharge d&apos;Affaires for &quot; possible discussions in the sense of the Burian Note.&quot;   (Seecdso under Austria-Hungary.)    On October 1st, Air. Robertson reported, in connection with a projected visit toEngland  by M. Colijn, that this Dutch politician desires peace because of his interestsin the petroleum supplies.    Italy. From a despatch -from Air. Erskine  dated September  19th,  it appearsthat the  official  communique to the Italian Press  on that  date  contained the words :&quot; The Italian Government must point out that the Austrian proposal aims at initiatingfictitious  peace negotiations wdtlrout  reality   or  probability 0f practical  success.&quot;Detailed reasons are added.    Serbia. There  is much rejoicing at Corfu about  the  Bulgarian  armistice.(British Consul, October 1st.)    Turkey. Lord  Derby on  September 25th forwarded an account of articles inthe French Press which expressed the opinion that Turkey and Bulgaria were too much bound up with Germany for  it to be possible to hope that  a  sudden  change will occur in either favourable to&apos;the Allies.  On September 26th he called attentionto an article in the Temps pointing out,  as  affecting  terms  of peace wdth Turkey, the grave  dangers which  have been caused  to the Allies  by the Germanophil Turkishpolicy.  The  article concludes with references to the  agreement  come  to betweenGreat Britain and France in  1916, &quot;on the initiative of His  Majesty&apos;s Government,&quot;about Syria and Palestine, and adds that French opinion attaches a high price tothose engagements.     6G33-1!)                               K
    It seems probable from information  received from  Sir II.  Rumbold (September29th) that the Bulgarian separate peace overtures will very shortly be followed by-similar  overtures  from Turkey.   Tins  is  confirmed  by a report  received  fromMr.  Robertson  (The  Hague)  on  the  same  day,  and by a further report fromSir 11. Rumbold on October 1st.    German Wireless of September 27th and the  Daily  Review of September 26thcontain reports which amplify those referred to last week.    United  States. The Daily Review of September  30th contains a full report of president Wilson&apos;s speech delivered in New York on September 27th.   The following is an  extract:      &quot; We accepted the issues of the war as facts, not as  any group of men  either hereor elsewhere had xlefinecl them, and  we can accept no outcome which does not squarelymeet  and settle them.  These issues are these :     &quot; Shall  the  military power of  any nation  or group  of  nations  be suffered todetermine the fortunes of peoples over whom  they have no right to rule  except  theright of force ?    &quot; Shall  strong nations be free to wrong weak nations and make them subject totheir  purposes and interest ?    &quot; Shall  peoples  be  ruled  and  dominated, even  in  their own internal affairs, byarbitrary and irresponsible  force or  by their own will and choice ?    &quot; Shall  there be  a common standard of right and privilege for all peoples andnations or shall the strong do as they will and the weak  suffer without redress?    &quot; Shall  the assertion of right be  haphazard and  by casual alliance or shall there be a common concert to oblige the observance of common rights ?    &quot; No man, no group of men, chose these to be the issues of  the struggle.   Theyare the issues of it;  and they must be settled -by no arrangement or compromise oradjustment of interests,  but definitely and once for all, and wdth a full and unequivocalacceptance of the principle  that the  interest of the weakest is as sacred as the interestof the strongest.    &quot; This  is what  we mean  when  we speak&quot;  of  a permanent peace, if we speaksincerely, intelligently,  and wdth a real knowledge and comprehension of .the matterwe deal wdth.&quot;
                   APPENDIX                           to western  and General Report No.  88.  Part  II.  THE  BASIS OF GERMAN  POLICY.(Revised up to date from Report No. 52.)     Ou account of the continued complete dominance of the military authorities overGerman policy, it is thought that the following quotations merit consideration, becausethe mental attitude of the Great General Staff at Berlin has been permeated for manyyears by the opinions of their author, von Clausewitz.     The . adoption of the  principles set  forth in the first  two  quotations resultedlogically in the violation of Belgian neutrality, and the horrible cruelties  perpetratedupon the Belgian civil population.  The U-Boat and other  outrages  may  be traced tothe same influence.  The third quotation throws a light upon the  German endeavours,direct  and indirect, to create a peace atmosphere, and may be found valuable as aninterpretation of their present policy.   The  fourth  and fifth quotations  bring thesituation up to date :                          I. The &quot; Scrap of Paper &quot;  Policy.     &quot; Self-imposed restrictions, almost imperceptible and hardly worth mentioning,termed usages of international  law.&quot;                       II. The German Conduct of  Warfare.     &quot; War is an act of violence wdiich in its application knows no bounds.&quot;     Compare :      &quot;What  is permissible includes every means of war without which the object ofthe war cannot be obtained.&quot;   (German War Book.)                    III. The  German Peace Offensive (1916-18).     &quot; If a preponderance on the side  of the attack, although daily diminishing, isstill maintained until peace is  concluded, the object is attained.  There are strategicattacks wdiich have led to an immediate peace but  such instances  are rare; themajority, on the contrary, lead only to a point at  which the forces remaining are justsufficient to maintain a  defensive, and to  wrait for peace.    Beyond that  point the scale turns, there is a reaction ; the violence of such a reaction is commonly much greater than the force of the blow  .... To  overstep this point is more than simply a useless expenditure of power, yielding uo further result,  it is a destructive step which causes reaction ;  and this reaction is,  according to  all  general  experience,  productive of themost disproportionate effects.  . .  .   The greatest danger  of a reverse is  often justat the moment when the offensive ceases and passes into the  defensive.&quot;        IV. The Sois sons-Chateau Thierry Counter stroke (July 18th, 1918).     &quot; The defence will  not always have the same superiority over  the offensive.   this must be particularly the case in a defensive which commences after the exhaustion of  the offensive, and has its theatre of war usually situated at the apex of a*i offensivetriangle thrust far forward into the (enemy&apos;s) country.&quot;                             V. The Present Situation.     &quot; ddre  moral forces,  courage  on  one  side rising  almost   to  audacity, andextreme depression  on the other, now begin generally- their active play. . . .  Thehitherto successful paiiw now generaBy thanks providence if he  can escape with onlythe surrender of all his gains,  without losing some of his own territory.&quot;
