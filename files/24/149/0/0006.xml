PART n.-FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.               :  &apos; /    Information from all quarters  proves once  more  that  by far the most effectiveform of propaganda is a military success on the Western Front.   The victories on theMarne and the Sommc are reflected  in the more favourable tone of the Neutral press and of  the official communications  from  all  parts  of  the world, except Mexico (seeespecially Switzerland,  p. 9).  Peace  by  negotiation is less discussed and a militarydecision is no longer dismissed as impossible.     A  very  important conference  has been  assembled at  German  Imperial  Head- -quarters,   ddie Emperor of Austria,  is said to  be present together with all the leadingstatesmen of the  Central Powers.   The object of the  conference is reported to be tocome to a complete agreement upon all outstanding  questions of policy.                         PKAOR DISCUSSIONS (-seepage 9).     Switzerland (see page 10). The changed views of  General Count Mont gel as onthe possibility of German defeat, as reported  by Sir  If.  Rumbold, are  interesting.     Finland (sec page  10). There  seems to  be  some  chance of  the  breakdown ofthe negotiations between the Bolshevist and Finnish representatives now in  Berlin.     Sweden  (see  page  8). Sir  E. Howard  reports   rumours   that  netherlands government is about to propose intervention.                                GEN ERA i, (see page 2).     The coal position continues to  be very unsatisfactory.                                  ALLIED GROUR.     China (see page 2). Monsiguor  Petrelli, the  recently appointed Papal Nuncio to  China, is a friend of  the  new German Foreign Secretary, von Hintze, who is a Roman Catholic, and is  suspected  of having brought about  the appointment. . The French Government is  reported to have protested.   Latest. Information  is that the Chinese Government have refused to accept Nuncio.  [Telegram from  Sir  J. Jordan, dated August 14th.]     Cuba (see page  3). German influences   are at work  with a view to obtaining control of Cuban trade.   Very liberal concessions have been obtained from  the Cuban Government.                                  ENEMY GROUP.     Austria-Hungary  (sec  page 4). The general  Conference of Polish, Czech  and. Jugo-Slav Deputies  has issued  a declaration  in favour of  the solidarity of the Slav peoples.

     Germany (see page 4). The output  of  German coal mines lias  been. reel needowing to dysentery and to political unrest.   -  Owing to disturbed conditions  German representatives  have  left  Moscow  forPskov.  Communications between Petrograd and Pskov being- interrupted, they havebeen compelled to travel via Uelsing-fprs, where.they hayp now  arrived.     The threat of preferential tariffs against Germany lias had a great effect in thatcountry.  (See also Peace Discussions, page 9.)                                 NEUTRAL Gitonp.     Denmark (sec page 5). The United.  States War  Trade Board are now satisfied.with, the  Danish  shipping proposals.   288,000 tons  of  Danish, shipping will  be available for the war zone instead  of 133,000 tons as at present.     Finland  (see page 5).- The presence of Allied troops on the Murman coast isbeing used by the Germans to influence  Finnish public opinion against the Entente.His Majesty&apos;s Government  has consequently issued  a declaration of our  policy.    The Monarchy Bill has been read a  third time, but did not receive the necessarymajority.   The question was  referred to the Constitutional Committee, and the newDiet  wid. elect a monarch.    Mexico (see page 0)- A  short note  upon the  situation created by the taxation ofMexican oilfields is of considerable interest at this moment.     Netherlands  (see  page   7). The  Queen lias agreed  to the   appointment  ofJonkheer  van Nispen.  as Minister for Foreign Affairs.   He was recently Minister tothe Vatican and probably has  pro-German  leanings.     Norway  (see. page 7). The alleged use of Norwegian  territorial waters by german submarines has again  been under discussion between  the  Governmentsconcerned.    Spain (see, page 8).  Sir A. Hardirige states  that  the Spanish Press has beeninformed that the decisions of the Cabinet  on all questions, including those of foreignpolicy, have been adopted  unanimously,  and  he therefore concludes  that  the pro-Allyelements in the Government, have gained the day.   The Prime  Minister has, however,declared that the maintenance of neutrality is vital.                                                                         N.  M.    August 15th, 1918.

PART  II.-FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.     Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau,  the  total tonnageof 500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing-ships, reported lost  owing to  the  malice  of the Ring&apos;s enemies during the periodAugust 2nd August, 8th inclusive, was 63,312 tons gross, of which 33,527 were British,as compared with 25,184. tons gross, of which 1.6,132 were British, reported last week.     Shipbuilding and Tonnage available. A  memorandum  (G.T.  5369)  issued  bythe  Admiralty states that the output of  merchant tonnage  during duly  has  beenadversely affected by the annual holidays on the Tyne and Clyde and Belfast, and also by the influenza epidemic  which  temporarily reduced  the  labour available  in  someyards by nearly ohe-half.  According to the same memorandum, although there is anet loss of British, tonnage to record for duly in which month the losses included theJustiaia and the tonnage transferred from foreign flags is much less than for several months past the tonnage available for service  was  again greater at the end than atthe beginning of the month, owing to a further  large reduction in the British tonnageunder and awaiting heavy repairs.     German &quot;Safe-Conduct&apos;&quot; System for Neutral Shipping. His Majesty&apos;s  ministers in the neutral countries affected, having made certain  representations in respect ofthe proposed  public  announcement of  the Allies&apos; views on the subject  of Germansafe-conducts for neutral  shipping, action in the matter has been  postponed.  (SeeReport No. 79, under &quot; United.States.&quot;.)     Coed  Position. A memorandum (G.J\ 5395) issued by the Ministry of  Shipping-states that there is no improvement to report in the present  very unsatisfactory coalposition.   (See Report  No.  80.)   The   matter is,  however, engaging the  anxiousattention of the Departments concerned, and it is hoped that suitable  measures maysoon be devised to relieve the situation.     Hospital Ships. The Ministry of Shipping states that the situation&apos;as to sailingsof hospital ships in the Atlantic remains unaltered.     Anglo-German Prisoners&apos; Agreement. Sir W. Townley  reports  that  German&quot;safe-conducts&quot;  have now  been given to the shipping companies concerned, andarrangements  have been  made for  hospital ships to  sail  on or about August  17th.He has been  informed  by the Netherlands Government that  the German authoritieshave withdrawn their objection to the continued  execution  of  the  paragraphs in theAgreement relating to internment in Holland.  (See Reports Nos. 79 and 80.)ALLIED  GROUP.                                     CHINA.     Diplomatic Relations with the Vatican. Mr.  Barclay (Washington)  reports thathe has been informed that Monsignor Petrelli, the  recently appointed Bapal Nuncio to china, and  lately apostolic delegate  to the Philippines, is  an intimate friend of thenew German  Foreign Secretary, Admiral  von Hintze.  He  states, further, that it isconsidered  suspicious that the  establishment  of diplomatic relations between the vatican and  China  should coincide with von.  Hintzels  appointment, and that theUnited  States Minister at Peking has been  instructed to warn  the Chinese Govern-ment of the friendly relations existing between Petrelli and von Hintze.   The DailyReview (F.P.)  of August  12th prints  a message from Peking  stating that the French
government has lodged a protest with the Chinese Government against the establish-in en t of diplomatic  relations between China and the Vatican on the ground that such,relations are incompatible  with the Franco-Chinese Treaty of 1858, which providesfor French protection  of  Roman  Catholic organisations  in  China;  and  that  theappointment  of  a Papal Nuncio to China  is regarded in well-informed quarters in peking as a German political move engineered by Admiral von Hintze who is himselfa Catholic.  A Pome message  of August 11th states that it  is asserted that in view ofthe  remonstrances  made by  France,  the appointment of  Mgr.  Petrelli  has been cancelled.                                     CUBA.     Sugar Shipments. A  memorandum (G.T. 5395) of August 10th issued  by  theMinistry of Shipping  states that the sugar supplies for 1918 will be drawn to  theextent of nearly  80  per cent, from Cuba.   The balance of  the supplies will be made good from the West Indies, Peru, and Mauritius.     German Influence  in, Guha. A War Office  Summary (M.I. 0 B) of August I 4thstates that a sure source reports having received  information  to the effect that  theinterest supporting  the Cienfuegos Palmyro aud Cruces  Electric  Railway and power company are all German and  pro-German and Spaniards with  German association and.  German sympathies, and that the main concern backing the establishing of  this railway company is  the firm of  H. Upmann &amp; Co., associated with the Hamburg houseof the  same name.  -     The  object of  this  company  is  to  entirely put out of the business  the CubanCentral Railway, Limited (a British controlled concern), as  well as to link up a chain of  German controlled  companies  established  in  Cuba, with a view  to  obtainingcomplete  control of  the  trade  of Cuba.  The Cienfuegos  Company  has been successful in obtaining some extraordinarily liberal concessions from the  CubanGovernment which  gives them  such an advantage as  to render competition  wdth them out of  the question.                                     ITALY.     Family of ex-Czar&apos;-. Count de  Salis reports that the Pope is interesting  himself in the  efforts that are being made to liberate the Empress of Russia and her daughters,and that he is prepared, to meet any expenses  in  connection  therewith.  In reply tothe  Cardinal. Secretary of State&apos;s enquiry, Count de Salis stated that, as far as hecould  judge, any steps which  would tend  to  alleviate the  position  of the ex-Czar&apos;sfamily would be welcomed by  His Majesty&apos;s Government.   (See Report No. SO under&quot;Spain.&quot;)     Application, of Military Jurisdiction Agreement to British, Troops. Mr. Erskinereports that the Italian Government  has expressed its  readiness to extend   themilitary jurisdiction agreement so as to apply to all British  troops in Italy, subjectto  certain specified conditions which  have  also been submitted   to  the  FrenchGovernment.                               UNITED STATES.     Military AgeJAnnit. According to  a Washington message in the Daily Reviewof August 15th, Mr. Baker, Secretary for War, stated  that tire extension of the draftages for the American Army was decided upon in accordance with the recommenda-tions of the military section of the Supreme War Council at Versailles.  A new Appro-priation lbII  to cover  the increased  army expenses will accompany  the draft-ageextension  measure, which will  shortly  be  ready for  submission  to  Congress.Mr.  Barclay states that  be is informed  by the  United States  Secretary of  State  that-since the announcement of the Bill for raising the draft  age to 45, there has  been arush of applicants  for  commissions and voluntary enlistment, and as this  may causedepletion in ranks  of indispensable trades and  dislocate  Government business,  theauthorities have decided to refuse  commissions  to,  or voluntary enlistments of,  menwho would become liable  under the  new  draft law.  They hope that  Canada  will-adopt  the same attitude towards men who are now crossing over to that country.   (SeeReport No. 80.) .
ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    Conference  of Polish,  Czech,  and Jugo-Slav Deputies. An Italian Wireless ofAugust 12th.  states that  the  general conference of  Polish,  Czech, and Jugo-SlavDeputies has  signed  a declaration in favour of the solidarity of the Slav peoples ofAustria,  as  follows:  &quot;Brought  together by an  ardent wish freely to  decide,our owndestinies,  by the most lively  preparation  for  independence and liberty,  followingduty  with brotherly  solidarity,  and convinced that we shall be able  to reach  thecommon goal only through common efforts, we, representatives of the Polish,  Czech,Slovak, and Jugo-Slav people, declare and  stipulate  in this  moment of worldlyconvulsions a permanent and indissoluble alliance of the Slav peoples.&quot;    Representative at  Moscow. Austrian  Wireless  of August  11th  informs  the&quot; Russian Federative Soviet Republic&quot;  that as the departure of the official  Diplo-matic  Mission has been delayed for about a week, the Austrian Consul-General at moscow, von  Pottiere, has  been entrusted  meanwhile with the representation, of  the austro-Hungarian Monarchy.    Release of  Civil and War Prisoners in Russia. According to Russian Wirelessof August  12th, there has been  a  Conference between  the  representatives  of  the austro-IIungarian Government and of the Russian Peopled Commissariat for ForeignAffairs, at  which it  was decided  to evacuate  as soon as possible all the Austro-Hungarian  civil and  war prisoners  upon the condition that  they intend  to  return home.                                GERMANY.     Coal Output. German Wireless of August 12th gives the weekly  report  of the berlin Stock Exchange and notes a certain  activity in coal shares, which it attributesto the coining  rise in the price of coal, although this rise has not received  officialapproval.   The increased price, it  states, will be almost exclusively used to  raise the pay of the miners.  Sir H. liumbold, however, states that he has received independent evidence that the output of German coal mines has been seriously  reduced owing to dysentery and political disaffection.     German Embassy in Moscow. Russian Wireless of August  11th states that, as a result of  the murder of Count Mirbach, negotiations have been begun between the German  and Russian Governments  concerning- guarantees for  the safeguarding of the German  Embassy in Moscow.  The   Russian  Government  having refused the establishment of a German battalion at Moscow, other guarantees were considered. Jdiese having  been  found inadequate, the  German  Diplomatic  Mission  has  pro- visionally decided to transfer  the Embassy to some  other place.   Meanwhile, the new diplomatic  representative, Dr. von  Helfferich, is still in Berlin.     Crimean Deputation in Berlin. German Wireless of August 8th  states that  a deputation  of the Crimean Government reached  Berlin  on August 6th  under the leadership  of the Minister of Finance, Count Tatistschef.     Post-bellum Economic Wttr. Lord Derby states that  Monsieur Marcel  Cachin,. Socialist Deputy, discussing in  IIcure  results  of Imperial Conference, observes that decision to  adopt preferential tariffs directed against Germany has caused consternation throughout Germany in circles where militarism is not rampant.NEUTRAL  GROUP.

                                   FINLAND.     Finland and the North. Mr. Grove learns on good authority that Prince Oscar ofGermany arrived at Helsingfors on August 3rd, and that the German troops in Finlandare being sent to France and  Ukrainia, there being only about 12,000 left.  He is also informed that the Finn  officers in the Cierman army  have resigned,  and that theFinland Government at last realises that it has been merely Germany&apos;s catspaw but is unable to free itself from German control.   The Foreign Office informs His Majesty&apos;ministers in Paris, Rome and Washington that it learns that the  Germans have used the presence of  Allied troops on the Murman coast to alarm Finnish, public opinon as to aggressive  intentions  of the Allies against  Finland, and it has  therefore issuedthe following declaration :      &quot;  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  have received, representations from the  finnish government, indicating a belief  that Allied forces had assisted, or intended to assist,one of the  parties engaged in the civil war in Finland, and showing an  apprehensionthat His Majesty?8 Government might help  certain Russians to invade  Finland andfoment civil war in that country.  There would seem also  to exist in Finland afear that Great Britain desires to set up a separate Republic in North  Russia under british tutelage.     &quot;His  Majesty&apos;s  Government desire  formally to  contradict  the  allegation ofassistance having  been given by the Allied  forces to one of the  parties in  the civil war in Finland,  and to state that the Allied military authorities have  never at anytime co-operated with the  Finnish  Red Guards  in Finland.   Further, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have no  intention of assisting any  Russian party to invade Finland orto foment civil war in that country.     &quot;In regard to the  question  of  the Murman coast and  Karelia,  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be glad to see a satisfactory  settlement attained, but are bound topoint out that the solution of the  question does  not lie with them.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment understand that the claim of the Finnish Government is based on anarrangement made between Finland and the Russian Government in 1864.  NeitherHis Majesty&apos;s Government, however, nor any other Government would be justified inasserting of  their own motion, that territory which, so long  as there was a recognisedGovernment in  Russia,  had been unquestionably Russian, should  now  belong toanother State.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are in no way hostile to  a final settlement     6273-2b                             B                                  DENMARK.    Post-bellum Trade  with Germany. It is stated in  a W.T.I.D.  Summary ofAugust 9th (G.T. 53G6) that Sir R. Paget  has been informed  that the Germans,during the recent negotiations for a renewal of their Commercial Agreement with denmark, failed in their attempts to make arrangements  for trade  between  the&quot; twocountries  after the wrar..  They specifically  proposed that the Danes  should allow them  the  option of  purchasing  the  whole of the  surplus of Danish agricultural.produce for a period of five  years.  They also approached  the Danish  Associations,the East Asiatic Company and the United Shipping Company with proposals for post-bellum trade.  Their proposals were in all cases declined.    United States  and Danish  Shipping. According to  a W.T.I.D.  Summary ofAugust 9th (G.T. 5366), the United  States War Trade Board  are satisfied with the danish shipping proposals as they now stand.  Although  465,000 tons were originallyasked for, only 455,000 tons have been offered, hut it is estimated  that under the new-proposals  288,000 tons of Danish shipping will be available for the war zone insteadof 133,000 tons as at present.   The Danish Government  are making representations to the German  Government  in  order to obtain certain concessions  necessary to the carrying out of the proposed  agreement with the Allies.   For  instance, the  GermanGovernment wall be requested to permit Danish vessels sailing to South America tocarry cargo  from  the United States to South America on  the  outward  voyage.Meanwhile, the terms of the agreement referred to above are under consideration,,and it  is anticipated, that the agreemeut will shortly be signed.  In view of the resultof the negotiations, it has been found necessary to amend somewhat  the terms of theexisting  Anglo-Danish coal and  tonnage  agreement, and the  Foreign  Office hasforwarded to Mr. Barclay a  short revised text wdiich is to be annexed to the generalAgreement.
 of the  question in harmony, with Finnish  aspirations, and it is  unnecessary to say that they have no aggressive intentions towards Finland.   His Majesty&apos;s Government fear, however, that, so long as Finland is  under German influence, the Finnish claim will he  supported  by  Germany merely  in: order to  enable  German submarines  to operate unhindered in the Arctic Ocean.  This is  consonant with the interests neither of thh Allies, nor of neutrals.  It would .inflict a great wrong on  Russia, and would he of no benefit to  Finland.   It  is solely  with  a view to keep up communications with Russia and to prevent Germany from obtaining a submarine  base on  the Arctic Ocean that the Allies are maintaining  troops on the Murman  coast,  ddie last thing- they contemplate is  the acquisition of territory either there or in any other part  of Russia.&quot;  (See Reports Nos. 78-80.)      Introduction of Monarchy. Sir F. Howard reports  that  the Monarchy Hill has been read a  third time  in the Finnish Landtag by 75 votes to 32, but this  does not give the five-sevenths  majority required  by the constitution.   A petition signed  by 60 members of  the Landtag has been presented in favour of measures being  taken  by the  Government for the  election of  a King  in  accordance  with  Article 38 of  the Constitution of 1772, when Finland was  still  united  to Sweden, and which  provides that, should  the male line of the Royal Family become extinct,  an  election for a successor  shall be held.   The matter was referred by the Landtag to a Constitutional Committee, which has adopted the proposal.  This lias now also  been agreed to  by the Landtag, and it has requested the Government to take the  necessary steps  for enabling  the  new  Diet to  proceed  to elect  a  monarch.   The Session ended  on August 10th, and re-assembles on the 27th.      Food Supply.-Sir 13. Howard, is informed by the Swedish Prime Minister that the Scandinavian Governments have made representations, to London and Washington in respect of  relief to Finland.  Although he  knew what the reply would  be, the Prime  Minister stated that  it was  exceedingly difficult  for Denmark, Norway and Sweden not to try, at any rate, to do something to relieve distress in Finland.  (Sec Reports Nos. 79 and SO.)                                     MEXICO.      Allied Policy and Taxation  of Oilfields. Mr. Thurstan  urges the  importance of arriving  at a speedy decision  as to  Allied  policy  in Mexico.  The actions of President Carranza  are  reported to  have  been  hostile  and aggressive towards  the United States and distinctly pro-German, and Mr. Thurstan is authoritatively informed that the recent German  reverses have  in no way shaken Carranza&apos;s confidence in  Germany&apos;s invincibility.   He  thinks&apos; that the  proposed taxation of the  Mexican  oilfields may be utilized by the German Minister in Mexico as a means of precipitating  conflict between that country and the  United  States.  The taxation referred to  was  imposed by7 a decree of February 19th last, which also provides that the oil companies  must file manifests,  and these questions have  caused  grave concern to the companies  interested,  ft appears that if manifests are not  tiled  the titles of companies will be  annulled ; if they are filed the companies  will obtain permission to form subsidiary  companies which will exist  under licence at the arbitrary pleasure of the Mexican  Government.      A  meeting of   representatives of oil  interests was  held at Houston, Texas, to  discuss the situation and decide what  course  the  companies should take.  Subse-  quently other  meetings took -place in New York, and as a result of  deliberations,  Mr. Barclay reports  that the American companies have decided not to file  manifests  unless they are directed to do so  by the United  States Government.  Mr. Thurstan is  informed that the Mexican Eagle Company&apos;s New York representative was not present  at  the Conference  as that Company does not  see  that  any useful purpose wdll be  served  as far  as negotiations with the  Mexican Government  are concerned, and; in  addition, that Company fears that the United States Government will  withdraw its  support at the last  moment, an opinion  shared by the  Mexican  Government, which  consequently will  use  every  means in  its  power  to  enforce   its principles.   On  August 6th Mr. Thurstan reports that the Mexican Government has published a new  decree abrogating the decree of February 19th, but maintaining the principles of that  decree which are so objectionable to the oil companies, and British oil  interests  arc  menaced  as much as ever.  He suggests, and  the United States Ambassador concurs,
that a protest  he entered in respect of the new decree.  There is a proposal amongthe oil companies to test the legality of the decree in the Mexican courts.   In a messagedated  August  1.1th, Mr. Barclay states that  the United States President has  been requested by American companies  to  promise armed  assistance in their protection,which he has refused.  The companies have been advised  by the United States state department to  exhaust every possible legal remedy there is, so  as to have  as perfecta case as possible for presentation to an international tribunal.     According to Memoranda Nos. 320 and 321 issued by the Intelligence Departmentof the Admiralty, there is little change in the political situation.   A fresh concentration of Government troops in  the oilfields  district is reported.  The British  Consul atTampico considers that  if these troops attacked General Pelaez with determinationhe  would  be  forced  to  evacuate  the  oilfields.   It is not thought  that  PresidentCarranza would be able  to  hold the  oil district permanently, but even  temporarypossession would place him in a strong position in the event of  international trouble.Well-informed  opinion  in Washington does not  believe  that  President Carranzaintends to  advance.  The feeling  of discontent at President Carranza&apos;s  oppressionand mismanagement  is so great that there is some possibility that one  or other of hisenemies  may  make a bid for power with a  good  chance of  success.   PresidentCarranza is leader of  a small clique.  His followers represent no one but themselves.They are universally detested.  Their sympathies are undisguisedly pro-German  andhostile to Great Britain.

Nolens  has completed  the new Dutch Cabinet with the exception oftwo portfolios, namely, that of Finance and Foreign Affairs.  It is suggested that thelatter portfolio  will  be offered  to donkheer  van Nispen tot  Sevenaer,  the  DutchMinister to the  Vatican,  and that the  new  Government  will  prepare  for  peace.The Queen of Holland was at first averse to  this  appointment, but Sir W. Townleylearns that  Mgr.  Nolens has succeeded  in overcoming  Her  Majesty&apos;s  objections.He informed the Queen that owing to the intrigues of certain politicians, particularlyColijn and London, he was unable  to complete the Cabinet, and he explained that heand his party were committed to demand a Parliamentary Cabinet, and consequentlythey would  oppose any  Government formed  outside Parliament.   Such an aclminis-tration  could therefore exist only with  the co-operation  of  the Socialist  Party.Thereupon  the Queen consented  to van hlispen&apos;s appointment, and Nolens thinks ifhe accepts the portfolio others who have  previously declined to join the Governmentwdll accept office.   (See Reports Nos. 79 and SO.)     Wireless Communication  loith Colonies. According to the Nieuwe RotterdamscheC our ant of August 10th, the  Minister  of Waterways has placed an  order with theTelefunken Company of Berlin for the construction  of a  wireless installation  nearKortwijk (Gelderland)  for communication between  Holland and  her East  IndianColonies.

Mr. Rennie understands  that  an agreement hasbeen  reached between  the  Peruvian  Government  and  the representative of theAmerican Shipping Board  in respect  of the  utilisation  of German &apos;  ships.   ddieapproval of  the  United.States  Government to the agreement is now  being sought.                                     SPAIN.    Relations with Belligerents. The Spanish Cabinet has met several times recently,but the nature of  the questions  dealt with has not been divulged.   According to the daily  Review (F.P.) of  August; 12th,  the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sehor Dato,declared that the matters discussed were of such a delicate nature that the prematurepublication  of details  might  be fraught  with,  the most far-reaching  consequences.Asked if a new diplomatic note had  been sent  by Spain to Germany, Seiior  Datorefused to make a  statement, and merely said that the Cabinet had decided to enforce the recently adopted Neutrality Bill as quickly as possible.   The  Minister of ForeignAffairs, on August 9th, invoked the assistance of the directors of  Madrid newspapersin maintaining secrecy.  Sir A.  Hardinge states, on August 10th,  that the Press hasbeen informed that the decisions of  the Cabinet on all questions, including  those offoreign policy, were adopted unanimously, and  therefore concludes that the pro-Allyelements in the Spanish  Government have  gained  the day.   The Daily Review ofAugust 13th  quotes a Madrid message of August 11th, stating that at the conclusionof the sitting of the Cabinet at the Palace, a semi-official Note was issued, the  chiefpoints of which are !as  follows :  As regards the foreign  policy of Spain, the PrimeMinister  declared  that it   could  undergo no  modification,  as  the  maintenance of neutrality was vital to Spain, but that he was certainly not opposed  to  the  vigorousdefence of  the great national interests  entrusted to the Government.  (See ReportNo. SO.)                                    SWEDEN.    Scarcity of Mica, for Electrical Purposes. An extract from  a  commercial letterprinted in War Office Summary (M.I. 6 B.) of August 9th states that Sweden last yearcut down. 50 million tons of firewood to make up  for the 12  million tons of coalusually imported from England.  She cannot continue to do this  for long, and there-fore Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are doing everything possible to electrify all thethree countries for power, heat, and light.  In order to do this, however, it is  essentialthat they have as an insulator mica.  Norway and Sweden cannot  produce  anything like enough of this  mineral for their own consumption.  To-show the scarcity of micain Sweden, the letter states that prices have gone up from about 1.0-kroner per kilo to120 kroner.   Germany also cannot get any mica, and is relying on its own accumulatedstores ; when these are  finished, the electrical industries will come to a standstill,and this will assist  in ending the war.    It is also  asserted that the  Germans  have five mica mines  in German  EastAfrica, and  the  writer  states that he wrote last year to  the  authorities in Londonentreating them to arrange for the  mines to be worked by the British  Government.The export of mica from Norway has been forbidden.    Sweden and Peace Intervention. Sir E. Howard reports  that  it is  .rumoured in sweden that the Netherlands Government is  about to  propose intervention.   JdieSwedish newspapers, representing all parties, have recently been  urging  that the time has come for neutral intervention,  and they express the hope that the  efforts of  theNetherlands Government in this  connection will  be  supported by the scandinavian government:

Theorganisation will consist of .1.5 members nominated by the Swiss Federal Council.     Post-bellum Trade. German Wireless  of August  10th states that  the SwissChamber of Commerce in Berne urges  the  Swiss Federal Council to extend the  freeports of the country in Bale, Geneva, and Locano, and to increase the deposits in theinterior of  the  country in the interests of  the development of Swiss trade after the war.   Switzerland, owing to  its peculiar geographical situation and its coniinuni-cations,  is sure to develop  to a considerable  extent as  an international  trading-country.PEACE DISCUSSIONS.     The absence of  serious peace discussion and the tendency to wait upon the resultof military operations is as marked this Aveek as it was last.     Central Poivers.- The speeches by the  Prime Minister  and by Mr. Balfour havenaturally been, freely commented upon.   The criticism is of  the usual class, of whichthe following extracts are fair examples :      (1)  According  to  a Vienna telegram  the  Neues  Wiener  Tageblatt  writes incomment upon Mr. Lloyd George :      &quot; Malevolence alone will misrepresent the character of the Avar which the  CentralEmpires are obliged to  wage.   It is a defensive Avar for our very existence.  It is truethat Prussian  militarism is fighting admirably,  but its famous leaders, blind en burgand Ludendorif, haAre almost exhausted themselves in  assurances  that they are onlyexerting their genius to give peace to the  world, and  not  to  make concpiests. if mr. Lloyd George is serious about a  League of Nations, then ail obstacles to peacevanish immediately.  In reality,  however,  militarism,  as Mr.  Lloyd  George sees it,dominates the British Empire to-day.&quot;     (2)  Commenting on Mi-. BalfouPs  remarks  the Pcheinisah Wesbfalische Zeitungsays :      &quot; It  is now  clear  that England does  not  Avant to  surrender those conqueredterritories which  are to complete  her world empire.  It goes without saying that if she retains these  territories, England has Avon the war and finally sealed our encircle-ment and strangulation.&quot;     Lord Lansdowne&apos;s letter has also met Avith a certain amount of adverse criticism,e.g., Yossiselie Zeitung of August 8th says : -     &quot; Their various  peace programmes did not differ somuch as to their  aim but asto  the means to  attain  it.  Their aim is clear, namely, the political, economic andmilitary  reduction of Germany to compfete impotence.  This goal  is to  be reachedthrough  a  League of Nations.   Lord Lansdowne, too,  expressly demands  Germany&apos;scapitulation before real peace negotiations can be initiated.&quot;     The Vorwaerts in opposing &quot; defeatism&quot; Avrites :      &quot; Such views would find no support from the masses of the people.  The  terribleexperience  of  Russia taught that  peace at any price  is no peace at all, and that abelligerent people, in spite of the terrible sufferings of war,  can  aBvays hold outbetter than a people  Avhich attains  peace  by boAviug to  the  will of enemy demands.What  German,  asks  Vorwaerts, envies  Russia ?  What German  is  desirous offolloAving her  example ? &quot;     Similarly the Internationale Gorrespondenz (Social Democrat) writes :       &quot; Regarding one thing must we be quite clear.  That is, that  the way to peace is to-day, as formerly, by the attainment of a German victory. Every German reverse
is a triumph for the  fanatical war wagers who have directed the Governments sincethe beginning of the war in the countries of the Entente.&quot;    . The threat of an economic boycott after the war  appears  to be very seriously-regarded, &apos;e.g., the Vorwaerta writes : - - &quot; As Germans  we  fight  against  this  penalsentence on our foreign trade because we are  not going  tamely to submit  to  havingour  backbone  broken;  as Socialists Ave  fight because  from a continuation  of  theeconomic war we fear fresh devastation from the flames of a world war.&quot;     Switzerland. Sir Id. Rumbold reports  a remarkable  change of opinion : &quot;Threemonths  ago General Count Montgelas did  not believe that the German. Army could possibly be  defeated in the field.  Now he  sees  that it could be completely defeated.The German soldiers are absolutely worn out and  are only living on  the  hope of a decisive victory, which will  bring about peace.  If peace does not come,  and the prestige of  tire army is still  further shattered, they will  very soon grow  demoralised.Iii  any case they will not  last beyond the  autumn  unless some  great  victory isgained,  i     &quot;The  turning-point*of the war  is ludendorff&apos;s refusal to  evacuate  the  Marnesalient for political reasons.  On military grounds he should certainly  do so,  but  hedares not face the effect it would have on the German people.   It would  be taken asa tacit admission that the General  Staff do not see their way  to a  decisive victory.and new peace proposals would be immediately launched.&quot;     And in &quot;another report from the same source :      &quot; According to Count Leyden, German  ex-diplomat, now  in Switzerland, thereis no difference of opinion between  Hertling  and Ludendorff  concerning Belgium.&quot;    ..&quot; It.is also a mistake to  believe  that  Ludendorff dreams of annexations in thesame  way  as  Count Reventlow and the  pan-Germans.   Ludendorff  is very level-&apos; headed  as   regards  military  possibilities   obtainable.   There  exists  a  certainantagonism between him and pan-Germans.&quot;,     &quot;Informant is distinctly  under the  impression that Leyden&apos;s visit  to  FrenchSwitzerland with object  of  asking  for peace of  conciliation  has  full  approval ofGerman Chancellor, with whom he is on intimate terms.     &quot; In Count Leyden&apos;s opinion, temper of German  army is such that if wholetruth about Entente victory should become known, Government  would  be forced tomake new peace proposals.   Germany is being held together only by hope of militaryvictory.   Theory  that peace is impossible   without  abdication  of  Hohenzollernsrepresent spirit of great  part of German army to-day.&quot;     Holland. -Sir W. Townley reports that M. Nolens has succeeded in overcoming the Queen&apos;s objections to the appointment  of M. Van Nispen, the Dutch representative at  the Vatican, as Foreign Minister.   M. Nolens&apos; political enemies hold  that  his Government will prove pro-German and will  compromise Holland by working  tooopenly for peace.   This  M. Nolens denies,  but also asserts that  the situation of  the country could not possibly be worse than it now is.     Finland. Sir  E. Howard (Stockholm) reports information that  Russo-Finnish peace negotiations  are  to be  broken off  on  account  of excessive  Finnish demands vvhich are  supported by  Germans.  Demands include  west shore  of Lake Ladoga, Lake  Onega, and Gulf of  Onega,  as well as entire Koln  Peninsula.  Bolshevists may, however, accept in the end.      Great  Britain. A  report  from  the Ministry of Labour says:  &quot; There  is rather less pacifist writing than usual in the Labour Press, and the opposition  papers  are  speaking  up.   Justice,  referring to a translation of   a  book by Carl  Liebrecht on  Militarism, affirms that  a  negotiated  peace, even without indemnities,  and  with the  restoration of  occupied country, would be  a substantial German victory.&quot;
