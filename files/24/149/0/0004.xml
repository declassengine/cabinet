There are strong indicationsxthat the German policy is to  use  the  &quot;peace&quot;negotiations in. Berlin  between  representatives  of  the  Finns  and the BolshevistGovernment as a means of forcing Finland into, war with the Central Powers.   these negotiations were   transferred from  Reval to Berlin, and M.  Vorovsky has  beentransferred from Stockholm to represent Russia at the Conference.  (See also under&quot; Finland,&quot; on page 8.)                               GENERAL  (see page 2).    In  the statistics  of  shipping  sunk  between July 19th 25th, the average ofBritish tonnage was  raised materially  by the loss of the Justicia and  Carpatliia, butthe average daily loss of world tonnage continues to decline.                                ALLIED CouNT-ruus.    Belgium - (see page 2). Mr. BalfouFs reply to Count  Hertling&apos;s speech treatingBelgium as a pawn appears from Press reports to have been effective in Germany.    China (see page 3). The Chinese solution of the problem of internment of enemy aliens is important, as  affecting  negotiations  for the exchange  of prisoners of warwith  Germany.  (See also under  &quot;General,&quot; on page 2.) ^    Italy (see  page 4). Signor Nitti  has expressed the opinion that  the masses in italy  are gradually perceiving the real issues of the war, and  have never been sounited as they are at the present moment.

PART  II.---FOREIGN  AND GENERAL..GENERAL.     Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau,  the  total tonnage of  500 tons gross in the case of steamers, and  100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships, reported  lost  owing to the malice of the  King&apos;s enemies during the period July 19th-25th, inclusive, was 82,371 tons gross,  of which 67,18! were British, as compared with 60,243 tons gross, of which 40,452 were British, reported last week.     The Admiralty remarks  that  although the number of vessels lost during the week under  review  does  not  exceed  the average  of recent weeks, the total British tonnage lost is considerably greater than usual, owing to the inclusion of two large vessels the Justieia, of over 32,000 tons, and the Carpathia, of over 13,000 tons.  As regards world&apos;s tonnage the Admiralty  observes  that  the average daily  loss  has steadily declined since the second  quarter  of 1917, the  figures for  which represent the apex of losses by submarine.     Hospital Ships. The Ministry of Shipping announces that in view of the sinking of the Llanclovery  Castle, the question as to the procedure to he adopted in connection with Hospital Ships on the Atlantic run to and from the United Kingdom is engaging the close attention of the War Staff of the Admiralty.   In the meantime the hospital ship service on this run has been-temporarily discontinued.     West African Coast.- The Ministry of Shipping  notes  that  the increased use of the ports on this coast from Gambia to the Cameroons for the export of  ore,  palm oil, kernels and groundnuts for  the United Kingdom, has brought out prominently a lack of proper harbour  and  railway facilities for the handling of the large steamers which are now being loaded there.     Anglo-German Prisoners Agreement. Sir  W. Towniey  is  informed  by  the Netherlands-Government that after the Anglo-German Prisoners Agreement had been signed and before  the departure of  the British delegates, several proposed alterations in the  text  were  communicated to the German  Government.   The Germans have accepted certain of  the alterations but  will not  agree  to  others, particularly the exclusion from  repatriation from  Holland of  German submarine  crews, as  they consider this would  not be fair  to those transferred  on account of illness  or thoseinterned under International Law.ALLIED  GROUP.                                   BELGIUM.     Germany anal the Belgian Pawn. Commenting on Mr. BalfouFs  speech on theoccasion of  Belgian  Independence Day,  the Berliner Tageblatt writes: &quot; We areunable to support the pawn theory, and it is an error to believe that either the enemy or the neutral world will find this idea of  a pawm an acceptable one.   As this reply of Mr. Balfour was to be foreseen, it  is clear  that  Count Hertling&apos;s  declaration wasriseless.  Its only importance was that it drew a line separating the  Government fromthe Annexationists on principle.&quot;  The paper also declares that Mr. Balfour distortedCount Hertling&apos;s speech, as, it says, Count Iiertling  never spoke of  &quot; any territories &quot;which Germany wanted to retain in exchange for  Belgium.  (And see Report No. 78.)     A Foreign Office Memorandum of July 24th, in dealing with this question, makes the following comment:       &quot; There is  a general  inclination  among  the  Majority Parties an inclinationwhich is naturally strongest in the Catholic Centre to regard liertling&apos;s statementof the 12th  on Belgium as a distinct advance upon his  former declarations.  Hertlinghimself asserts  that he said&quot; practically the same things  on February 24th.  Yet itcannot be forgotten -chat the  Prussian Conservative leader, Herr  von Heydebrand,
                                    BRAZIL.    German Banks. German Wireless of July 27th quotes the  Agenzia Amerikanaas reporting from Rio de Janeiro that the Minister for Finance, in accordance with aGovernment decision, has begun the liquidation of all the German banks throughoutBrazil.                                                                 s&apos;    Loss of Trade. Lord Reading informs the Foreign Office that at a meeting held atthe State Department, Washington, the Brazilian Ambassador pointed out  that owingto Allied, trade restrictions, the trade of Brazil had been reduced with consequent loss to her revenue.   The meeting decided that each representative present should furnish-statistics  of the  past few years showing  the  actual course of trade in respect of thecountry he represents.     Proposed British Embassy in Brazil. Sir M. de Bunsen learns that the Presidentof the Brazilian Republic is very anxious that a British Embassy should be established in Brazil, and the appointment made before he goes out of office on November 15th.The President states that he has received assurances that  the French and italian governments intend to  follow the lead of His Majesty&apos;s Government.                                    CHINA.    &apos;    Intervention in Siberia. A Tientsin message (July 25th) states that the cabinet has decided that China will take part in the intervention in Siberia.    Passage  of Czecho-Slovak Forces  over  Raihvay Lines. Sir J. Jordan  reportsthat the Chinese Government consents to the passage of Czecho-Slovak forces  overlines of the Chinese Eastern Railway while internal disorders exist in Russia.    Internment of Enemy Subjects. Ine  Foreign  Office  learns  that the ChineseGovernment proposes to intern a number of  the most dangerous enemy subjects andto enforce the passport regulations in  a manner agreeable  to the  Allies.   These.proposals  the Allies  have accepted,  and have urged that they be put into force immediately.     New Loan to China. Sir C. Greene  reports  that  the United States Ambassadorhanded to Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs  a memorandum explaining proposed new loan of 10,000,0001. to China by the United States, Great Britain, France and.Japan.                                     CUBA.    Enemy Subjects and their Property. Mr. Leech reports that the President of  theRepublic has sanctioned a  law dealing with enemy subjects and their  property andwith enemy trading.   Congress has made a  provision that constitutional  guaranteesinterpreted his words as meaning that Germany meant to retain a political, economicand  military supremacy, while a member  of  the  Reichstag Majority gathered that belgium was to be  quite  independent &apos; even of Germany.&apos;  It  is thought  that allambiguity has now been  dispelled, and, if Germany could  negotiate with Belgium  asa pawn, it is probable that  she would offer or withdraw various degrees of  &apos; indepen-dence&apos; according to the equivalents which the  Western Powers, particularly England,were willing to  grant.  For  the  rest,  Mr.  Balfour has  disposed of  this monstrous&apos; pawn &apos; proposal.&quot;     Higher Insurance Council. German Wireless of July 29th states  that a Higher.Insurance Council will be established in Belgium  to supervise the newly-introducedSocial Insurance, which is to  co-operate in the  preparation and execution of the laws and  regulations regarding  the sick and old-age insurances.   Seven members of theCouncil will be appointed by  the insurance  companies and six by the Government.
shall be re-established - when the law is  enforced.  The President, in a message  to congress, declares that the law is inadequate and  says immediate  special legislationmust be introduced  to meet the situation, because, if the  constitutional guaranteesare restored, they will prevent the continuance of  the censorship and the detention  of-suspected persons.                                    FRANCE.     Closing  of  Franco-Swiss Frontier. Lord  Derby states  that entry into France from Switzerland  is  forbidden, for  sanitary  reasons,  and that  French citizens are not permitted to cross into that country.   Although foreigners are not  prohibited from going  to Switzerland from France, they may be  unable to  return.  A later despatch states that the frontier  has  also been  closed against passage from France into Switzerland.     Malvy Trial. Lord Derby reports that  on July 29th, during the Malvy trial, M. Viviaui made an impassioned speech in the course of which he expressed great indignation  at charges which had  been recklessly  brought against  M. Malvy, and ridiculed the idea that the latter had in any way acted  at the instigation of Caillaux. It is stated that the speech made a great impression on the High Court of the Senate. The Paris correspondent of The Times states that all the  witnesses have now been heard, and the trial is  expected to conclude on  August 5th or 6th.  (And see Report No. 78.)                                        &quot; )                                 GUATEMALA.     Consular  Officers  of  German  Nationality. Mr.   Young reports  that the-Government of  Guatemala has  withdrawn  recognition  of  all  consular  officers  of German nationality.                                     ITALY.     Political Situation. A  despatch  of  July  20th from Sir  R.  Rodd  records a conversation between himself and the Italian Minister of the  Treasury, Signor  Nitti, previous to the latteFs departure for  Paris and London.  Signor  Nitti expressed the opinion  that Italy  had probably never been so  united  as at  the  present moment, chiefly clue to the fact  that the masses  in the country were gradually perceiving the real issues  of the war.   The Official  Socialists were,  with the exception of a few irreconcilables, now disarmed so far as  opposition  to  the Avar was concerned.   With regard  to the Chamber, Signor  Nitti did  not anticipate  any difficulties arising, the fact being that no one  washes to overthrow  the Government, and if Signor Orlando were to resign, he himself, as really the head of  the Opposition, was the only possible alternative,  and  as he and Orlando were working most harmoniously together, there would therefore  be no  change in policy.                                    JAPAN.    Intervention in Siberia. A Foreign Office Memorandum of July 25th states thatthe Japanese Government has accepted the United States  Governments  proposal asto armed assistance to Russia through Siberia, subject to certain reservations.  (Andsec Report No. 78.)    Proposed Inter-Allied Commission. The Foreign Office favours the appointmentof Mr. Henry  Sly, C.M.G., as  representative of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government on theproposed  Inter-Allied Commission at vladivostock, subject  to  arrangements being-made for the  carrying  out of his consular duties at Harbin.  The functions of theCommission  will be  to co-ordinate Allied action  with regard  to such  matters astonnage, transport facilities, currency, exchange  and principles and methods of  localdistribution.    The Anglo-Japanese Alliance.--Jn a despatch, dated  June  13th, Sir C.  Greenestates that the Japanese Press gave expression to the very keen interest of the nation
                                  PORTUGAL.    Diplomatic Representation at the Holy See. The Daily Review (F.P.) of July 24thstates that diplomatic relations with the Holy S$fe  have been  re-established, and thePortuguese  representative  is the ex-Minister  of  Labour,  Jose Feliciano  da Costa.The Portuguese papers of July 4th print a letter  from the Pope to the  PortugueseBishops expressing his pleasure that relations are to be restored and that the Law of separation should have been amended.    Meeting of Parliament. The  Portuguese  Parliament  was opened  on July  15th.It is thought that Senhor Shnas Machado will  be  chosen President of the Chamberof Deputies.                               UNITED  STATES.    Shipbuilding  Activity. United  States  Wireless  of  July  26th  states  thatcomparative statistics show a great increase in the shipbuilding  industry in PugetSound and  Grays Harbour since 1915.   From June  1915 to December 1917 thetonnage launched in this district has totalled  150,000 deadweight.  In the first sixmonths of this year  the  district launched 73 vessels,  total 488,700  tons.   TheWashington correspondent of The Times states  that this year&apos;s output  of  ships  from american yards will not be far short of three million tons, and that next year it willbe.well over six million tons.    Reported  Coal Shortage. Lord Reading  reports that the United States  FuelAdministration estimate that for 12 months ending April  1st, 1919,  635,000,000 tonsof bituminous coal will be required, being an  increase of 12 per cent, on that  usedin the previous 12  months.   To  meet this, 80,000,000 more tons  must  be producedduring the year ending April 1st, 1919, than was the case in the previous 12 months.The Fuel Administration are endeavouring by various means to  meet the situation,but it is anticipated that there wdll be a shortage during the coming  winter months.Preference  will,  of course,  be  given to industries engaged  on  war work, and no great difficulty is anticipated in supplying  fuel  to meet the steel requirements for theBritish Government.     German &quot; Safe-conduct &quot; System for Neutral Shipping. Lord  Reading states thatthe Associated  Governments (Great  Britain, France, Italy and  United States) willaddress an identical communication to European Neutral Governments wdth referenceto the German &quot; safe-conduct &quot; system.  This  communication will point out  that theso-called &quot; safe-conduct&quot;  system  is  merely  a threat of  illegal condemnation or destruction  unless  German control  is  accepted ;  and  that   such control   may     6073-5fc                               Bin the visit of Prince Arthur of Connaught.  The Hoclii Shimhun, a principal daily ofTokyo, in the course of a leading article, said :-&quot; In particular, is not an exhibition ofour heartfelt sincerity towards the Prince needed to sweep away the misunderstandingsaroused by Count Terauchhs opinion regarding the after-war relations of Japan andGermany as reported in the Outlook ?  At this  day the writer sees no ,call to enlargeon  the conspicuous  past  services  of the alliance.  Japan joined in the war from aliberal interpretation of its terms and respect for its principles.   Germany was sweptfrom Kiao^chao, England was enabled to concentrate her fleet in home seas, and theenemy prevented from securing mastery in the Pacific  and Atlantic  as  a result ofEngland  and Japan&apos;s co-operation in warlike  action.   And  the help given in theIndian Ocean and Mediterranean, and the financial assistance rendered  as an evidenceof goodwill,  prove incontestably  Japan&apos;s ungrudging efforts.   No one with  a  clearinsight into the past and present efficacy  of the  Anglo-Japanese Alliance will doubt ofits yet greater potency in the future.  The  Japanese Government  and people  must make of  His Rojml PIighness&apos;s visit an occasion  to show unmistakably  their deter-mination as touching this esteemed alliance, which so largely affects Far Eastern, and,by extension, world peace.&quot;
deprive vessels of their neutral character. The Associated Governments will, accordingly,reserve the right to deal with any vessel which has  subjected  itself to enemy control as circumstances in each case may warrant.   Neutral Governments will  be given tounderstand  that, in any case, a ship sailing under such &quot;safe-conduct&apos;&apos; will renderherself liable to be detained until the conditions which the enemy Government hasattached to the issue of the &quot; safe-conduct &quot;  have been ascertained and scrutinised, inorder that such action may be taken as the circumstances may be deemed to warrant.In order to combat German  propaganda,  steps are to be taken to inform  neutralpeoples of the details of German  threats, and of the control imposed thereby, and toeducate them as to the consermences which such control would entail according to thegenerally accepted principles of International Law.    Surplus Cotton Crop. According to Lord Reading, Southern Banks  and plantersare becoming anxious regarding the marketing of the anticipated exportable surplusof over 9 million bales of cotton from the present crop.  It has been proposed thatthe United States Government should purchase at a fixed price all cotton for which noother buyers can be found.ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    Resignation  of Seidler Cabinet. The  Daily Review of  July 25th  quotes atelegram (July 22nd) from Vienna confirming the resignation of Dr. SeidleFs Cabinet.In a letter  accepting the resignation, the Austrian  Emperor writes to Dr. Seidler : -,; You  have  pointed  out  that  you can  no  longer  promise  success   for  yourefforts  to  ensure  a  majority  in  the - Lower  House for the  necessities of theState, and  that, moreover,  the  difficulties exist solely in  your person  and in yourrelations towards a political party  which does not assume an attitude of  oppositiontowards the  necessities  of the  State, but would,  on the contrary,  be prepared tosupport another Government  pursuing the same general  policy.  In these circum-stances  you  yourself see] in  your  retirement  the  pre-requisite condition, of asatisfactory solution of  the present Parliamentary  situation.&quot;   ddie ex JZducationMinister, Baron Hussarek von  Heinlein, has succeeded Dr. Seidler who  has beenappointed Director of the Imperial Civil Cabinet in succession to Count Polzer, which,says Vorwcirts, is  generally regarded as a concession to the Germans.  The german press comments on  Seidler&apos;s  resignation  are illuminating.    For  instance,  theVossische  Zeitung   writes  that  his  year of  office  has  been one of  the  most fortunate ever known  for Austria, and it will take quite an  exceptional statesmanto  efface  the results  of his  actions ; the Vonodrts  says : &quot; Idle Slavs  will  not tolerate a second Seicller, and the Germans will be  suspicious of any Premier who is less pro-German than  he has  shown himself.   Dr. von Seidler  lias aggravated  theState crisis and  rendered the  task  of his successor completely insoluble &quot; ; and the vienna correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung remarks that the  German parties are exceedingly annoyed at the turn events have taken, and express their determination to support  the new Prime Minister only if he gives guarantees that the German policyinaugurated by Dr.  von Seidler will be firmly pursued.   The Times  correspondent atIdle Hague states that  the latest reports from Vienna  make it seem very unlikely thatHussarek  will  secure  a  majority  in the  Reichsrat.   A Vienna  telegram  from an authoritative source states that the new Prime Minister&apos;s plan is to form, for the timebeing, a non-political Cabinet  composed  solely of officials, and,  according  to  the daily Review (F.P.) of July 30th, his programme  comprises the  immediate passingof the Provisional Budget and the  making of preparations in the  near future to clear up and  organise  the  problems of  how national life  is  to  be ordered  with  theco-operation of the competent authorities.    New War  Loan. Italian  Wireless of July 27th notes  that  the Austrian Govern-ment is apparently nervous of the result of  the  eighth war loan, and has issued a notice stating that all  military  purveyors who refuse to subscribe will be  excludedfrom newr contracts.
                                  GERMANY.    Inauguration of  German  Economic-  Council. The  Daily  Revieiv  (F.P.)  ofJuly 30th states that the German Economic Council was inaugurated on July 26th,with Herr Schacht,  the Director of the National Dank, as President.  All departments were represented, and the President in his  speech dwelt on the world-wide economic importance of  Great  BritaiiPs adoption of a system of preferential tariffs  for  theDominions.   A representative pointed out that the problem which must first be solvedwas the economic linking up of Central Europe with the rest  of the  world  and thatthe next task would be the economic cultivation  of  the Near  East and  Far East for german industry,  against  Anglo-American  competition,  for  which  purpose  anextension of traffic communications in these regions  was considered important.    Politico! Situation.- Dealing  with  KuhlmamPs .resignation, a  Foreign. office memorandum of July 22nd.says : &quot; The resignation of Herr von Kiihhnann and theappointment  of Admiral von  Hintze as his  successor  cast a good deal of light uponthe present conduct  of German affairs.  In one aspect these events represent  thesuccess of long preparations  and efforts on the part of the &apos; small, but mighty party,&apos;the Prussian  Conservatives in  the Reichstag, who have kept in touch with Tirpitz andthe Pan-Germans and also, as  usual, with the Higher Command of the Army.   On fileother hand, events, the military situation, the state of Russia, diplomatic difficulties with Turkey  and Bulgaria, and  the personal character  and weaknesses of Plerr vonIviihlmann have brought matters to a head and have facilitated the final  coup.&quot;    A German Wireless of July 23rd states that in addressing  a public meeting atCassel,  attended by .1 2,000 persons,  Herr Scheidemann  announced that  the ImperialChancellor had informed him  and the President  of the Social  Democratic faction  thatthe Prussian Diet would be dissolved this year, and  new writs for an election issued.The  reason is that the Chamber and the Upper House  refuse to redeem the King&apos;spromise of equal franchise.   A Memorandum  (G.T. 5224) remarks that this is anannouncement  of very great  importance, and that  there is every reason to believethat  a  general  election  would  result in the overthrow of the Prussian Junker andGreat  Industrialist majority,  and  thus secure  the passage  of  the  Equal-FranchiseBill.   That would, be a blow at the roots of the Junker&apos;s power, as the King, if he isbent on reform, can always manipulate the Upper  House by  creating new members.A significant  article  in the Frankfurter Zeitung  of  July 17th  (No.  196,  FirstMorning Ed.) shows how the domestic political situation influences foreign policy, and how the intrigues of the Junker Party have for years made impossible a steady andconsistent policy on  the  part of the Foreign  Office.   The Memorandum,  however,points out that Hertling may attempt to use this policy of  Prussian Reform in orderto mislead the Allies, particularly the pacifists among their populations, and to make them believe that a liberal and pacific regime is  about to be  established in Germany.Commenting on Herr Scheidemann&apos;s statement that the Imperial Chancellor had told him and Herr Ebert that  the  Prussian Diet would  be dissolved  this year, the Norcl-deutsche Allgemeine  Zeitung  writes  that  the  words  put into the  mouth  of  theChancellor were either misunderstood or mi $reported.     German Wireless of  July 28th states  that  the former chief  of  the  MilitaryCabinet of  the German  Emperor,  Baron von  Lyncker, has retired for reasons ofhealth, and has been replaced by Baron von Marschall, the former Department chief in the Military Cabinet,     Mark Exchange.-- There  has  been  a  further general decline this week in the mark exchange.  In Copenhagen the exchange fell from 55&apos;95 on July 17th to 52-75on July 23rd.  In the same period the rate in Zurich fell from  69&apos;30 to 66&apos;75, andin Stockholm from 49&apos;25 to 46&quot;50.  There was a slighter  fall in  Amsterdam  and.Christiania.  (G.T.. 5235.)     Iron Industry. According to  D.M.I. Summary,  No. 676,   of  July 30th,the  efforts   of  the  State  to  monopolise  the iron  industry  in  whole  or  inpart  have crystallised  in a  proposal  to establish a company  with  a  capital ofMks/10,000,000 under the title of &quot;Ausfuhr G.m.b.H.&quot; in which the State will holda very large  interest.   It is possible that there will result from these steps not merelymore centralisation, but  also a monopoly  of the  import  of raw materials and theexport of  manufactured and partly manufactured goods.     Food Conditions. Mr. Maxse is informed by a Dutch  medical man who has beenin Berlin, Leipsig, Cologne, and Dusselclorf recently, that owing to the shortage of
food (lie condition of the population in general is far below par and it has no disease-resisting powers left.   Mr. Maxse states that it  is reported in German Governmentcircles that a recent General Headquarters Conference decided that &quot; win, tie, or lose,&quot;    f)the war must finish before 1919.  Owing  to under-feeding and war conditions, somuch apathy exists that there  is not much, chance of a  serious  revolution, thoughfrequent riots occur.NEUTRAL GROUP.                                  DENMARK.    Danish Commercial Negotiations with Belligerents.Sir R. Paget reports that the danish Government is prepared to take over accumulated British butter and to give his Majesty&apos;s Government the option to purchase any quantity  not  consumed  by april 1st, 1919 ; the price to be that now paid for it by the Danish Government, i.e.,400 crowns per cwt.   A Memorandum  (G.T. 5235) states that the Danes have agreedto keep the price of  Danish butter offered to the  United Kingdom at 50  crowns percask below the price paid by Germany.  In this connection representations are beingmade to Sir R. Paget that, while Denmark is selling her butter more cheaply to theUnited  Kingdom, than  to  either  Germany  or  neutrals, Great  Britain  is chargingDenmark  more for coal than is charged to other  countries.  Sir R. Paget thinks thatif this surcharge on  coal be maintained, the Danes will be obliged to increase theprice  of butter, and he therefore recommends that the surcharge be waived.    In  the  above-mentioned memorandum  it is  also  stated that the Germans haverenewed their commercial agreement with Denmark as from August 1st to December1st, 1918.  They have agreed  to supply Denmark with  400,000 tons of  coal duringthis  period and with specific quantities  of salt,  potash, stearine,  calcium chloride,paraffin, turpentine oil, sugar beet seed and clover seed.   They will send  12,800 tonsof iron and steel goods per month, 2,200 tons  of  shipbuilding materials  per -month,and 500 tons of benzine and petroleum per&apos;month.    The  Germans wdll receive in exchange  (a) 300 tons of tallow and. industrialfats ;  (/;; 35 per cent, of the Danish surplus of  butter and eggs ;  (c)^60 per cent,  ofthe cattle and meat surplus ; (cZ) 2,500 horses per month; (e)  2,100  tons of fish per month.; and (/) cryolite according to arrangement.     United Slates and Danish Shipping. According to  a Memorandum (G.T. 5235),Lord Reading believes that there is  now some  prospect  of  the United States war trade Board coming to terms wdth  the  Danish delegates  at  Washington  in regardto Danish shipping.  Idle  Danish  delegates  have  intimated  that  Denmark will  be content with 350,000 tons of shipping,  which leaves 450,000  tons for the Allies ; they state, however, that it  is  an  essential part of their  proposal that shipping left  toDenmark for  her own use shall  be free of any obligation to  engage in Allied trade,because the Germans will only grant safe-conducts on the understanding that none ofthe 350,000 tons reserved for Danish use are employed in Allied trade.                                   FINLAND.     German Pressure to secure a Monarchy.- The Daily Review (F.P.) of July 29thquotes  a  Stockholm  message  stating that  Finnish papers are beginning to  speakopenly of  German pressure to secure the establishment of a Monarchy.     Finland and the North. The Swedish Prime Minister has represented  to Sir E.Howard that the  Allied policy  with regard to the Murman Coast  would have theeffect of strengthening the position of those Finns who unshed to side withthe germans in attacking the Allied troops there.  Sir  E. Howard states  that he explained thatthe Allies wished to prevent the Germans getting a naval base there  and to keep anoutlet to the open sea for Russia ; and that it wras not  the intention  of the Allies to
establish  themselves therj  permanently.   Thereupon the  Prime. Minister said hisGovernment was very anxious that Finland should not be drawn into conflict with theAllies, and suggested that the Finnish Government might  give  a binding  guaranteenot to give military assistance to Germany if Finland were allowed to obtain  a  porton the coast, or, failing that, if the Allies promised them a certain quantity of foodstuffs.With regard to the latter question, Sir E. Howard states that he gave a similar replyto that given to the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs.   (See Report No. 78.)   Heasks for instructions concerning the  first point.     Food Supply. Sir R. Paget is informed  by the Danish Minister for Foreign affairs that there is no question of Denmark supplying foodstuffs  to Finland, which he  saysis not a protectorate of Scandinavia,  and that Swedehs interest is due to the fact that many Swedes reside there, which is not the case in respect of Denmark.     British Subjects in.  Finland. Sir E. Howard  states that be  has been informedprivately that British subjects in Finland have been advised to leave.                                    MEXICO.    Parliamentary Elections. Mr. T burs tan states that the elections  for  the  senate and  Congress took  place on July 28th, and that the opponents of Carranza&apos;s party were  not allowed to take any part  in the  proceedings.   Idle new  Chambers willcommence their  sessions on September 16th, and Mr. Thtirstan presumes they willrenew the permission accorded by the previous Chambers  to  the President of theRepublic  to  legislate  on all financial  matters  by means  of  decrees, in  which caseCarranza will retain all power in his own hands.                                NETHERLANDS.     Parliamentary Elections. According  to the Daily Review (N.P.S.) of July 26th,the result of the elections (held on July  3rd)  is  a  deadlock.   Of the 100 seats inthe Second Chamber 50 are held by the parties of  the Right  and 50  by the Left and several  small parties  whose  political allegiance   is   uncertain.   In  the  outgoingParliament  the relations of the parties were as  follows : The Left:  Unie-Liberalen,21 seats ;  Vrij-Liberalen, 10 ;  Vrijzinnig-Democraten, 8 ; Socialists, 15.  The Right:Roman  Catholics, 258 : Anti- Revolutionaries, 11 ;  Christian-Historicals, 10.  The oldGovernment was an extra-Parliamentary Government, made up of prominent membersof the Liberal parties.   The result of the elections leaves the representation of partiesas follows : The Left: Socialists, 25 (including 2 for the  Social Democratic party and  1 for the Socialist  Party, both of which are hostile to the Official Socialist Party) ;Unie-Liberalen, 6; Vrij-Liberalen, 4;  Vrijzinnig-Democraten, 5.   The Right:Roman  Catholics,  30 ;  Anti-Revolutionaries, 13 ;  Christian-Historicals,  7.   Of theCatholics  three members are doubtful :  1 Christian Social, 1 Christian  Democrat, and1 Christian Socialist.   Besides these several new  parties make their  first entry intothe  Chamber, all loosely affiliated to the Left.   Treub&apos;s party, the Economische Bond,has  3 seats ;  the Agricultural Party 1, the Middle-Class Party 1, the  Neutral Party 1,and the League for Democratising the Defence  Forces 1.   The political action ofthese small  parties is entirely uncertain, and  the  press of all &quot;parties  betrays  greatuneasiness as to the possibility of forming a stable government.,  The  elections  werefought  on domestic issues  and  the result of  the voting can  hardly, therefore, betaken as a declaration of the Dutch voters  on the questions  involved in the war.  SirW. Townley  states that the constitution of the new  Government is expected  to becompleted within a few days.     Shipbuilding  Material  for   Dutch  Vessels under  construction. The ForeignOffice requests  Sir  W.  Townley to make further enquiries as to whether facilities for obtaining British shipbuilding material will be welcomed by owners  of Dutch vesselsunder construction.   Sir  W.  Townley states   that he is reliably informed that theDutch representatives who are negotiating  the  shipbuilding question, with germany are most anxious to rid themselves of the  power  which the  latter exercises owing to     6073-56                               C
the fact that shipbuilding material has for some time reached Holland from Germanyonly.   The representatives have promised to draw up a statement showing what therequirements are to complete certain ships now approaching completion, and they are going to suggest that certain limited quantities of  shipbuilding materials should he-allowed into Holland for the construction of new ships, under conditions advantageous to the Allies.  Sir  W. Townley emphasises the fact that  the  great advantage to be derived from the supply of certain  quantities of shipbuilding  materials to Hollandis political rather than economic, and he hopes that it may be possible soon to arrangefor such supply as it would give the Allies  the  opportunity of  an  excellent politicalmove.   (See also Reports Nos. 70-72, 74, 75, 77 and 78.)                                   NORWAY.     Shipping Mission for Berlin. Mr. Ovey reports that a deputation consisting ofrepresentatives of the Norwegian-American Line,  the  ship owners  Association, theNorthern Shipowners&apos; Association,  the  Ministry of Foreign  Affairs,  and the  StateChartering Department, has left for Berlin.  Allied Ministers have been informed bythe Norwegian Foreign Minister that the Mission would not commit itself as  to anypost-war questions, and that the chief matter to be discussed would be the question of free passage for  passenger ships, although apparently admitting that the questionof cargo vessels would not be excluded from the discussion.     Norwegian Banks  and  Gel-man  Loan Proposals. Mr.  Ovey  learns that  theNorges Bank has written to the  Norwegian Banks Association suggesting  that allBanks should subscribe to the new German loan, in proportion to their capital andfunds for 30 millions (21 millions for renewal and nine millions new loan).  The  rateof interest offered is 2f over Norges Banks discount rate.  The Banks are, however,making very little response.  It is  stated that Germany will make subscription to thisloan one of the conditions for making a commercial  agreement with Norway, aad also as regards Norwegian seaborne imports.   Mr. Ovey is assured this wall be one of thequestions discussed, by the Shipping Mission referred to above.                                     PERU.    Peace Commission Treaty. Mr. Rennie  learns  that, before  signing the PeaceCommission Treaty (see Report No. 77), the Peruvian Foreign Minister wrote privately to Sir M. de Bunsen expressing the hope that subsequent negotiations might  lead tothe signing of a wider Arbitration Treaty.   At the request  of  the  Peruvian ForeignMinister, Mr. Rennie now transmits  the  desire of the Peruvian Government  to signan Arbitration Treaty with Great Britain similar  to  the one  between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and Uruguay.                                   SWEDEN.     Proposed Visit to  England  of  Social Revolutionary Party.  Sir E. Howard isinformed  that a delegation  of  the  Social Revolutionary Party is  at Stockholm  andwashes to  visit England to submit the Party&apos;s views to the Labour Party there  with theobject (1) of-enlightening Allied and  Socialist opinion on the Russian  situation  and make propaganda against Bolshevists ; (2)  to show necessity of Russia&apos;s renewing thewar in union with Allies ; (3) to prove to Socialist parties the need of their assistance as guaranteeing  its democratic object;  and (4) to inform them of the intentions ofthe Constituent Assembly.     Negotiations  for German  Coal. A Memorandum (G.T.  5235)  states that  theSwedish  delegates  wdio  recently went  to Berlin,  to  negotiate  with the  german authorities returned on  July 20th, and it is reported that they have arranged for theimport of 150,000  tons of  German coal into  Sweden during August.  (See ReportNo. 77.)
n     Swedish Legation in London. Sir E. Howard states that the announcement ismade that Mr. Dardel is to succeed Mr. Bostrpin as Secretary of the Swedish Legationin London, an appointment which he considers satisfactory.   (See also under &quot; Finland.&quot;)                                SWITZERLAND.     Consignments to  Prisoners of War.  Sir  H. Rumbold is informed that on andafter August 1st the Governments concerned will be charged one-half of the transportrates in respect of collective consignments of  foodstuffs to prisoners of war carried over Swiss railways,  ddie Allied Representatives in Switzerland have asked the  swiss government to postpone the application of the new rate until their Governments haveexpressed opinion on the question of deviation or derogation from Hague Convention.Sir 11. Rumbold points out that the question will only affect  collective consignmentsfor British prisoners of war when  the  scheme  for diverting such consignments from holland to Switzerland through Geneva comes into force.  (And see Report No. 78.)     Delegation to visit London.- Sir H. Rumbold states that M. Sultzer, Swiss Ministerat Washington, accompanied by M. Roussy, Director-General of  Nestle and Anglo-Swiss Condensed  Milk Company, expect to arrive in  London  about July 30th.   Themain object of   the visit is to obtain  parcel  freight  for raw  material for  Swissindustries.     Silk Exports to Northern Neutrcds. Sir  H.  Rumbold  states that  the AlliedBlockade  Committee  has considered  the  question of fixing  rations  for swiss silkexports  to Northern neutrals, and has decided that such a course is unnecessary  as the ration for imports into Norway,  Sweden. Holland, and Denmark has  already been fixed.   Consequently the  Swiss  Government  may  compete  with the  associated governments in  exporting  silks to  those countries within the rations fixed.  If  thesilk is sent via Germany, the amount will be limited  to  the  German transit ration.The Allied Blockade Committee in consultation with the Transhipment  Committee is considering the question  of granting greater facilities  for the transit of Swiss  goods to Northern  neutrals, via the United Kingdom.    Closing of Franco-Swiss Frontier. (See under &quot; France.&quot;)PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.     Belgium. Sir  H. Rumbold reported on  July 28th, on Turkish authority, thatthe Germans had given  a  guarantee to the  ex-Khedive of Egypt  that his reinstate-ment would be insisted on  as a peace condition before the King of the Belgians wasrestored to his  throne.     Tioumania. On July  22nd  Mr. Graham  forwarded a report, from the allied representatives at Jassy,  that, although  the Bucharest Peace Treaty had been ratified,the state of siege in Roumania had been extended for an indefinite period by decree.     Serbia. On July 25th a statement of the Serbian  or Yugo-Slav war aims was read at the inauguration  meeting of the Serbian National War Aims Committee  inLondon.   &quot;United States. On July  27th Lord Derby  reported on  good authority  that president Wilson had conveyed to  France  the information  that  he would  not  beprepared to agree to a proposal by Germany to give up Alsace-Lorraine and evacuateBelgium, in exchange for being given a free hand  in Russia.   President Wilson wras     6073-5b                            n
reported further to be in agreement with the general opinion that Germany, was likelyshortly to open a strong peace offensive.     Great  Britain. Carnarvon  Wireless  on  July  26th  cpuotecl  an  article  byMr.. Robertson of the Daily Chronicle as  indicating that  j)people. of Great Britain aresolidly united in their determination to seethe powrer of German militarism completelycrushed before the war is ended.     The Ministry of Labour in the report for the week ending on J illy 24th reportedthat Count Hertling&apos;s sjieech bad produced a  fresh flood  of  suggestions about peacenegotiations, and Mr. Henderson&apos;s tour had received the  approbation of  the PacifistPress.     Germany. In a Memorandum, elated July 22nd; on von  Kuhhnaim&apos;s  resignation,the Political Intelligence Department state that his difficulties began at Brest-Litovsk.The Eastern peace was a military peace, as wras shown  not merely by the presenceof General  Hoffmann,  and his peremptory  tone at the  peace negotiations, but  bythe practice, which  from that date became invariable, of  describing  everything thatwas clone by the Foreign Office as having been clone in accordance with the views ofthe Higher Command.  In a review of the situation in enemy countries during June1918  the Daily  Review  of the  Foreign Dress also  discusses  the German  peace.offensive in  detail,  with  special  reference to the dismissal  of von Ivtihlmann.  OnJuly 25th the same authority discusses the attitude of Georg Bernhard and  TheodoreAVolff  towards the revision of the Brest Treaty. These two authorities advocate revisionfrom diametrical!)- opposite motives.     On July 28th, Sir A. Hardinge quoted reports in the Madrid Press,  based upona  statement ill the  Vorwarts, that Germany  had communicated  to the SpanishGovernment her conditions for joining in a Peace Conference.  (This report from theV or warts has also been published in the British Press.)   The conditions include : -&quot; Freedom of the seas, dismantling of Gibraltar  and of  Suez Canal fortifications, and freedom, for Germany to use&apos;coal depots in all ports.&quot;     On July 25th, German Wireless reported  from the Press the following statement,.alleged to have been made  by Herr Scheidemann, in connection with the Socialistnegotiations on war aims conducted through M. Troelstra : &quot; I do  not know on whatfoundations  liuysmaim  bases  his  opinion that the  German  Social Democracy wouldbe willing to make any concessions in the Alsace-Lorraine question.  I myself, a fewweeks ago, in the course  of a lengthy conversation with Comrade Troelstra, said in.reality that  in the Belgian and Alsace-Lorraine questions I refer  to our Stockholmmemorandum.  Nobody in Germany can understand the  demand of the  Entente inconnection with Alsace-Lorraine.  As regards  the meaning of this statement, ComradeTroelstra naturally was  not in doubt a single moment.&quot;     (See also under &quot; Switzerland,&quot; which seems to be an important base for enemy&quot;peace offensives.&quot;)    Finland. On July  25th,  Russian AVireless  announced  that M. Vorovsky,Diplomatic representative at Stockholm, had been appointed President of  the RussianDelegation for peace negotiations with Finland  at  Berlin.  German  Wireless of thesame elate reported that the opening of  the  Finnish-Russian peace negotiations hadbeen postponed until July 29th, &quot;at the request of the Russian delegates.&quot;  In thesame message it is stated that the  German-Finnish Commission had unanimouslydecided that the line of demarcation in the Gulf  of Finland between Finland and russia should be the same as the old boundary.     On July 27th, Sir E. Howard  reported that the Swedish Press had quoted fromthe Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung a statement that the Russo-Finnish negotiations were undertaken with the-object of settling, between Russia and Finland, the questionof the  frontier, and the position  in Eastern Karelia.  On duly 29th, Sir  E. Howardexpressed the opinion, based on good information, that  the Germans were  making the bolshevists raise the question of the ceding of Eastern Karelia to Finland  a subject ofdiscussion during the negotiations in Berlin.   Their object in doing so, according toanother report, was to force the Russians to give territory in Eastern Karelia to the finns, who would then  demand our withdrawal from that  territory, and,  in the eventof a, refusal, would seek help from Germany to force us to evacuate the territory.  Onthe same date Russian AVireless reported that the peace negotiations between Russiaand Finland were being very sharply criticised by the Finnish Social Democrats, who did not support in any  way  the pretensions of  the bourgeoisie in Finland for the annexation of Murinan and Karelia.
     On July 30th  Sir E. Howard  forwarded important extracts from the  SwedishPress which corroborate  the view that the Germans are using Karelia as a bait to force Fialand into war with the Entente Alliance.   The Germans are said  to havemade the acceptance  of  a Monarchy  by the  Finnish Landtag, which meets  onAugust 5th,  a condition for acceptance in exchange for Russian Karelia being securedfor Finland by Germany.  A Finnish paper, Hufvudstadsbladet, is  quoted as havingannounced that the  Finns and  the Russians now form a common front  against theEntente,  because of Petschenka having been occupied.     Switzerland. Sir H.  Rumbold (July  20th, received  30th), reports on reliableauthority details of  an alleged  attempt to  induce the Pope and President Wilson, as representing the  Latin-German-Slav and Anglo-Saxon worlds  respectively,  to openpeace discussions which would only &quot; indirectly &quot; benefit the Central  Powers.   In afurther report of July 29th he  gives indications of  a visit  to  London of the  SwissMinister  in  Washington.   The object of this  visit  is obscure.  On  July  30th sir h.  Rumbold reported further indications  of the  German peace offensive, givinginformation  about the movements of the unofficial agents of this policy.13
