SECRET.    APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENEPAL                                REPORT No.  80.                      PART II. FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.                         PEACE DISCUSSIONS (see page 12).    The first meeting of the Conference between Representatives of  Finland and the bolshevist Government took  place at Berlin on August 3rd.  There is every reason tobelieve that  the  German  Government intends to  make use  of  this Conference asindicated in the &quot;Appreciation&quot; attached to  the  last Western and  General  Report,i.e., to force Finland to join the Central Powers against the Entente.   (See also under&quot; Finland,&quot; page 8.)                                     GENERAL.    (a) The  political effect  of the recent fighting on the Western front is clearlyshown in a generally improved tone  of all the neutral Powers towards  the  Entente&apos;.(See especially &quot; Finland &quot; (page 8), &quot; Spain &quot; (page 11), and &quot; Switzerland &quot; (page 12).    (b) The loss of British tonnage is still greater than new construction (see page 2).    (c) An interesting memorandum by the Ministry of  Shipping shows the generalcoal situation to be unsatisfactory (see page 2).    (cl) The  British  Government  declines to agree  to the repatriation  of german submarine crews.   Meanwhile sailings of  vessels engaged in repatriation of prisonersare suspended (see page  3).                                ALLIED COUNTIMES.    Serbia (see page 4). ddie Austrian Government is trying to conciliate Serbia, butthe Military Governor still carries out a  policy of oppression.  Signor Orlando hassent a message to  the Serbian Parliament  emphasising the very cordial relations whichhave always existed between the  two races.   German propaganda has recently been trying to sow dissension  ; this is Italy&apos;s reply.    Sir H. Rumbold is informed that the  Serbs have an intense admiration for  GreatBritain and are confident that this country  will be loyal to Serbian claims at the  PeaceConference.    United States  (see page 4).   ddie United. States Government has  issued an official statement on the subject of  military intervention  in  Russia.   In  the opinion of theGovernment  &quot; military  action  is  admissible only  to  render  protection  and help toCzecho-Slovaks against armed Austrian and German prisoners who are attacking themand to steady any efforts  at self-government  or  self-defence  in  which the Russiansthemselves may be willing to accept assistance.&quot;    Germany appears to be disturbed by the proposal that a representative of theUnited States should be  established at the Vatican.    Lord Reading&apos;s views  on the proposed preferential treatment  for British vessels in the Calcutta-New York trade are important.                               [P.T.O.

A Zurich message asserts that the appointment of Dr. Hussarek as Prime Ministerimplies an abandonment of the extreme pro-German policy.     Germany (see page (5). A very important memorandum on the position  and prospects of German sea-power has  been issued by the Political Intelligence Depart-ment of the Foreign Office.  It is summarised on pages G and 7.                                NEUTRAL GROUP.     Denmark (see page 7). Sir R.  Paget  reports that the delay at  the  conference between the United States War Trade Board and the Danish delegates at Washingtonis disturbing the Danish Government.     Lord Reacling&apos;s.views on the difficulties of the United States Shipping Board are important.     Finland  (see  page  8). Sir E. Howard is  informed that the  Finnish PrimeMinister and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are afraid of being drawn into war withthe Entente.   There is, however, in the country a  fear that the Allied operations  onthe Murman coast are directed against Finland and are hostile to Finlanchs legitimateaspirations.  The German  Government are undoubtedly trying to foster this feelingand will make the most of it at the Conference now sitting in Berlin.     Sir E. Howard advocates a definite statement of Allied policy towards Finland.     Germans are  reported to have  arranged for the import  of  large cpuantities of copper ore from Finland.     Netherlands (see page 10). By agreement with the Dutch Government, germany has  arranged to send  120,000  tons of  coal  to Holland monthly.  In view of the expected  change in the Dutch Government and the resumption of negotiations  for ageneral economic agreement,  Germany has  stipulated that the coal contract may  be cancelled after October 15th.     The Dutch Government is  anxious to resume negotiations  wdth His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment on the subject of shipping.     Norway (see page 10). Enemy  submarines are reported  to be  making use  of norwegian territorial  waters on their way to and from the Atlantic.  representations on this subject are being made to the Norwegian Government.     Spa/in (see page 11).- The attitude of certain  members of  the Government on thesubject of the torpedoing of Spanish  vessels shordcl be noted.     Switzerland (see page 12).-The reported changed  views  of  the Swiss GeneralStaff are interesting.                                                                        N.  M.

PART  II.-FOREIGN  AND GENERAL.GENERAL.    Sinkings. According to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau,  the total tonnageof 500 tons gross in the case  of  steamers, and 100 tons gross in the  case of sailingships, reported lost owing  to the malice  of the King&apos;s enemies during the period july 26th August 1st, inclusive, was 25,184 tons gross, of which 16,132 were British, ascompared with 82,371 tons gross, of which 67,184 were British, reported last week.    According to  the  Eighteenth Report  by the Board  of  Trade on Imports  andIndustry in relation to Shipping  (G.T. 5276),  the position as regards  tonnage duringthe past half year shows on the Avhole a marked improvement compared with  theestimates for 1918.  New building is greater and losses are smaller, but losses  stillexceed gains.   In this connection the following comparative table is of interest: Gains and Losses of British Vessels of 500 tons gross and over.	British-built brought into Service.	Total Gains including Purchases and Vessels requisitioned Abroad, &amp;c.	Loss through War and Marine Risks.	Net Increase or Decrease in Tonnage.January to June 1917 -July to December 1917 January to June 1918 -	Gross Tons. 375,000 618,000 776,000	5S9,000 1,057,000 1,142,000	- 2,206,000 1,750,000 1,360,000	-1,617,000 - 693,000 - 218,000   The Beport states that although destruction still exceeds building&apos;, the net loss of tonnage during the first half of1918 has been  comparatively trifling when compared with, the figure for the first half of 1917 and has been less thanone-third of the net loss during the second half of 1917.    Hospital Ships. The Ministry of Shipping states that the sailings of hospital ships in the Atlantic  are  still  suspended  pending a decision as to the conveyance of spanish Commissioners on board such ships.  (See Report No. 79.)    Coal  Position. According to a  Memorandum dated August  5th (G.T. 5328)issued by the Ministry  of  Shipping, the coal position  continues to  be very unsatis-factory, the total  amount  available for export each week is still considerably belowthe minimum programme.  Shipments to France have  increased  in the  past two weeks as the French ports have become less congested, but the shipments still remainbeloAV the minimum programme, and slightly below the receiving capabilities of theFrench ports.   The  coal  shipments  to Italy, howeArer, continue  to be satisfactory,and  in accordance with  the programme, Avhich, of course, is based on  a  very lowsupply as compared Avith  Italy&apos;s needs.  The shipments to the Scandinavian  neutralsare suffering very seriously and  barely 50 per cent, of the minimum programme  isbeing reached.    Shipments to South America are less  than  50  per cent,  of theprogramme, and the  meat works and South American  Railways are  likely to get intoa very serious position unless more coal is available.  A crisis has only been avoidedby sending British ships in ballast from this country to the United States to load coal for South America.   The French  Government in the Mediterranean  has received only30 per cent, of its requirements in July, and it has  been necessary for the admiralty to furnish coal from Naval stocks in the  Mediterranean, although  these stocks areexceptionally  low.   The  Egyptian State  Raibvays are  about 40  per cent, belowrequirements.   Efforts  are being made to arrange  for them to get  coal from SouthAfrica so  as to relieve this country, but it will be some time  before  the effect of this can be felt in Egypt.
ALLIED  GROUP.                                    CHINA.     Internment of  Enemy Subjects. The Foreign Office instructs Sir C. Greene toinform the Chinese Government that German threats  of reprisals will  not deter HisMajesty&apos;s Government from carrying out the proposal to intern enemy civilians inChina.   Should the German Government refuse to ratify the recently-signed Anglo-German  Agreement  because of  such proposed  action,  the only  concession  HisMajesty&apos;s Government  will  make  will be  to offer to  try  to  induce the  ChineseGovernment to agree instead to the repatriation of all the German civilians.                                     CUBA.     Compulsory Military Service. Mr. Leech reports that the President of the CubanRepublic has sanctioned the law introducing compulsory military service.  Under tinslaw the President must take steps for the immediate despatch to Europe of a contingent of the actual voluntary army and to add to  it, as far as possible, those who volunteer.The  Executive  Government has authority also to send a military mission to the UnitedStates, England, France and  Italy.                                    FRANCE.     Malvy  Trial. Lord  Derby  reports  that the Court  of  Justice  unanimouslyacquitted Malvy of  treason, but found him  guilty of having, in the discharge of his functions as Minister of the Interior, disregarded, violated and betrayed the duties ofhis office, and have  sentenced him to five years&apos;  banishment, dispensing him  fromcivic degradation, and condemns him  to pay costs.   (See Reports Nos. 78 and 79.)     Man-Power. The Daily Review CF.P.) of August 2nd states that  the  FrenchChamber discussed on July 31st the  Bill relating to the enrolment  and calling up ofthe 1920 class.   Several of the speakers  demanded the discharge of the  old classes,but M. Abrami, Under Secretary of State for Man-Power and Pensions, declared that france&apos;s object is  to end this war  victoriously as soon  as  possible by uniting all available efforts of  the Entente.   M.  Abrami added that it was necessary to call upthe 1920 class in the autumn. The Government would undertake to superintend theemployment of the 1920 class under strict conditions, and to settle the problem of thedischarge of the old classes.  M. Abrami pointed out  that, when  the  1920 class  wasincorporated, the 1888 and 1889  classes  would be sent back to their homes.  The1890  class would  be granted unlimited  leave along  with  the  auxiliaries  of  the1891 class, and men of the  latter class  attached,  to the fighting services would besent  back to the rear.     Demobilisation. A  Memorandum dated 31st July  (G.T. 5274),  issued  by theMinistry of Shipping, states that the formation of a general scheme for demobilisationon the termination of hostilities is being proceeded with,  and Conferences are being held with the War Office thereon.   These Conferences are being extended to include representatives of the Oversea Dominions.     Anglo-German Prisoners&apos; Agreement. The Foreign Office informs Sir W. Townleythat His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot agree to the repatriation of  German submarinecrews, but otherwise it is  prepared to ratify the Anglo-German Prisoners&apos; Agreement(see  Report No.  79).  The sailings  of  transports engaged  in connection with there patriation  of prisoners of war  having  been  suspended since  the sinking of theKoningin Regentes, were to have been resumed on the 6th August, but Sir W. Townleynow states that the sailings have been postponed indefinitely, as&quot; the German Authoritiesrefuse to give &quot; safe-conducts &quot; until the Agreement has been  ratified, the reason givenbeing that any alteration in the number  of interned prisoners of war in Holland willupset  the  calculations upon which the  repatriation clauses in the Agreement are based.
                                    GREECE.    Military Service  Agreement. The Foreign  Office informs Lord Granviile thatan agreement  providing for the military service of British subjects in Greece and ofGreeks in Great Britain will come into operation on August 8th.   Under this agree-ment British subjects in Greece &quot; between the ages of .18 and  51 must either leaveGreece for service in the British Army within 00 days from  date of Agreement, orbecome liable  to service in the Greek Army.&quot;   Lord Granviile  is  empowered to issueexemption certificates in certain specified cases.                                     JAPAN.     Proposed   Inter-Allied  Commission. The   Foreign  Office   is  informed  thatMr.  Henry Sly,  C.M.G.,  declines  the pest of Idis Majesty&apos;s representative  on theproposed  Inter-Allied Commission  at Vladivostock.   Sir  J. Jordan, suggests thatMr. Porter be  appointed.                                     SERBIA.     Close Relationship with Italy. Italian Wireless of August 2nd says that on theoccasion of the fourth anniversary of the War the  President of the Serbian Parliamentsent a message  to  Signor Orlando  stating  the  unshakeable  faith  of the  Serbianpeople in  the triumph of justice and freedom.  In his reply, Signor Orlando referredto the  heroic deeds of the Serbian people, adding that &quot;from her devastated ruinsSerbia will raise  a more glorious  creator for  herself and  her  noble Jugo-Slav race,to-day separated  and oppressed.  This is the faith of Italy and her wish.  The warm,sincere and cordial friendship between the  two  races will  be the strongest  lastingfactor  in   the  new  international asset.&quot;  These cordial  messages will dispel  theillusions of the German Press,  which  recently has been trying to prove that  seriousdifferences exist between the Italians and Serbians and that Italy is to protest formallyagainst the recognition of the Czecho-Slovak State.  As a matter of  fact the  Italian.Government has frequently officially declared such  recognition, and  was the first to recognize the rights of that people.     Political and Economic Conditions. Sir  H  Rumbold forwards some importantinformation about existing conditions in  Serbia which  he  has obtained from  an authoritative  source.  Be is  informed that Austrian political authorities are nowattempting to  win Serbia  by conciliatory methods,  but the  military Governor whoprobably  is instructed from Berlin represents a  policy of oppression.   Sir H. Rum-bold&apos;s informant  was told by Baron Kuhn, the representative of the Austrian ForeignOffice  at Belgrade, that the present Austrian policy was to conciliate the country and make the basis for closer relations in  the future,  Austria being anxious  to establish  a closer economic union with Serbia after the war.  Baron Kuhn said &quot; We are willing that Serbia should be quite free and have  a port  on the Adriatic,  or in the  South.&quot;Idle informant states further that a striking feature is the admiration of the Serbs forGreat  Britain, and the feeling is general that  England wdll be loyal to Serbian claimsat the Peace Conference.   With regard to food  conditions in  Serbia, Sir H. Rumboldlearns that great misery prevails in the towns, but  that  large stocks of wheat exist in  the country.   Owing, however, to lack  of rolling stock this cannot be transportedto Austria.     Exchange of Prisoners of War. ddie Austro-Hungarian Government has ratified the agreement with Serbia for the exchange of &quot; valid &quot; prisoners  of  war,  and  thenecessary orders have been given for  effecting such  exchange.   The Serbian  Govern -ment  has asked the assistance of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  carrying.out  theobligations contracted under the agreement.                                UNITED STATES.     Representation at the  Vatican. A German Wireless  message  July 30th, states with regard to the plan of Washington to  establish a United States representative atthe Vatican,  Catholic politicians in  Germany  declare that  by   means  of  such  anincrease of the diplomatic corps of The ;Entente  Powers at  the  Holy See, the illegalobstacles in the way of the Pope in  his diplomatic relations with the Central powers are still more  strengthened.
     Intervention in Russia. Lord Reading forwards the text of an official statementpublished by the United States Government on August 4th. on the subject of military intervention  in Russia.  After expressing the view that  such intervention would bemore likely to increase  than cure the present confusion there,&apos;and  to  injure ratherthan help Russia out of her distresses, the announcement states that in the opinion ofthe United States  Government military action is  admissible in  Russia now only torender such protection and help as is possible to Ozecho-Slovaks  against the. armedAustrian and German prisoners who are attacking them  and to steady  any efforts atself-government  or self-defence  in which Russians themselves  may be willing  toaccept assistance.   The troops will  be employed in guarding  military stores whichmay subsequently  be  needed  by  Russian forces, and to render such  aid as  may be acceptable to the Russians.  Stress is laid on the point that the United States Govern-ment contemplates no interference  with  the  political  sovereignty of Russia, nointervention  in  her internal affairs, and  no impairment of her  territorial integrityeither now or hereafter.  It is announced  also  that a  Commission  will be  sent  toSiberia  to consider means for  relieving the immediate economic necessities  of thepeople there.     Preferential Treatment to British Vessels  in  Calcutta-New York Trade. lord reading views unfavourably  the  proposal  to  give  preferential treatment  to british vessels  in the  Calcutta-New York trade, which he says opens  up a large question ofpolicy and creates  a precedent which  the  United States  may later take  advantage  ofto exclude British shipping altogether from  certain trades.   He considers  it most undesirable to adopt a measure of protection for a  particular trade without the fullestconsideration of the shipping  problem as  a whole, as it will  -present  itself after thewar, and states that there are  indications  that  the  present movement in the UnitedStates for controlling shipping rates is not intended solely as a  war measure.  Whilstit is improbable that any definite  policy has yet been formulated, the question of theemployment  of  United States ships after  the war is undoubtedly being considered,and  the experience gained now in controlling  ships of other countries, Lord Reading-thinks will probably be made the basis of some form of control  after  the war.  Hestates that an alternative proposal to secure the same result is being placed before theMinistry of Shipping.     Military  Age Limit. -The  Daily  Review  (P.P.)  of  August 6th prints  aWashington  message  stating that  Senator  Chamberlain, Chairman  of the  SenateMilitary Committee, announced that Mr. Baker, Secretary  of  War, would recommendthat the  draft ages for the United States should be made 18  to 45 years.  SenatorChamberlain added that Mr.  Baker had completed a new Army Bill embodying thesedraft ages, and that the  Bill would be introduced simultaneously in both  Houses of congress  in the first wreek of the session.     Deserters from United States and Canadian-  Forces. The  United States state department  has submitted  for   the  approval  of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government thedraft of a convention for the reciprocal arrest and return of deserters from the United-States and Canadian forces.ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.  &quot;     Food Supplies. (See under &quot; Germany.&quot;)     Political Situation. Baron von Hussarek,  the  new  Austrian Prime Minister, has announced the names of his Cabinet which is  virtually the same as the former one.Herr Gayer is Minister of the Interior ;  Field Marshall  Czapp, Minister of NationalDefence ; Herr von Wieser, Minister of Commerce ; Dr. Wimmer, Minister of Finance ;Dr. Schauer, Minister of Justice ; and  Count Silva-Taronca, Minister of Agriculture.     According  to a  Zurich ,message  appearing in the  Daily Review  (F.P.) ofAugust 6th,  the  Polish  papers  assert that  the nomination  of Dr. Hussarek as     6273-16                           B
Austrian Premier  signifies that the Government has given up its  extreme german policy.  Dr. Hussarek, they declare, has assumed no obligation to continue the  policyof Dr. von Seidler, and he intends to invite  the  Czechs to enter  the Cabinet againwhen the possibility occurs.   He  will take no covert action against  the  Poles, all ofwhich signifies a return to the era  of Francis  Joseph.                                   GERMANY.     Food Supplies of the Central Empires in 1918.- A Supplement to D.M.I. Summary (No. 678) of August 1st, analyses the  salient features of the conditions prevailing in the Central Empires  as regards food  supply,  and  concludes  with the  following remarks     Finally, it may be considered  as to how far the food  situation is likely to affect Germany&apos;s military effort.  As regards  the  actual  fighting line, it must  be allowed that German army rations are still adequate for their purpose, nor can it  be foreseen  with absolute certainty that in the  next .12 months they are likely to  fall to a point of danger.  The same may be said, though with  slightly  less confidence, of the Austrian A rmy, at all events as far as the most important battle front is concerned. The main problem is presented by the fodder supply, and there is no doubt  that a certain inconvenience has been experienced  and will  continue to be felt owing to the insufficient nourishment of  army horses.   Germany&apos;s difficulties, however, do not end with the  feeding of the front line.  The problem  for her is how to maintain the strength  of the underfed munition workers,  to bolster tip the morale of a  dissatified nation, and, to renew every year the struggle against falling  production and depreciated quality of food and materials.  The strain is  working  havoc among  the civilian population ; it will  reach the army in time, and  it will  be surprising if its signs  do mot become evident before the spring of next year is far  advanced.&quot;     Economic Conditions. A. War Office Summary (M.I. 6 B.) of August 1st  quotes a German Army Order dealing with the  extreme scarcity of  textile  raw materials in Germany,, and emphasising the necessity of requisitioning  wool from mattresses and bolsters belonging not otdy to French civilians  but  also to the civilian population of Germany  and  the  troops,  including  officers and officials.  The Order states that:   &quot; According to  Army reports, requisitions in the Army zones have already produced in round  figures over 10,000,000 kilos of wool.  Of these 10,000,000, 3,500,000  have been obtained by one single army.  With  these 10,000,000 kilos,  mixed with other textile materials, we can manufacture  10,000,000 complete uniforms.  If  requisitions are undertaken  energetically, it should be possible to obtain a further 5,000,000 kilos. As we have no more raw wool at home, these figures show how necessary it  is to carry- out these measures by every lawful means.&quot;     Resignation of Admiral  von Holtzendorff. German Wireless  of   August  3rd announces  that the Chief of the  Admiralty Staff of  the German Navy,  Admiral von floltzendorff, has resigned his  position on account  of  serious heart trouble.  Admiral Scheer, the Commander  of  the High Seas Fleet, has been  designated as his successor. Von Holtzendorff  has   been  appointed Grand  Admiral.  The future  Chief of the Admiralty Staff, Admiral Scheex,  is 60  years of age, and, together with Hindenburg and Pudendorff, he is  one of the best  known  men in the  present &quot;war. He  was especially feted after his success in the Skagerack naval battle, when he wras raised to the rank of  Admiral and  awarded  the &quot; Ordre  pour le  Merite &quot; with the oak leaves.     Sea   Power and  Shipping. An  important  Memorandum (G.T.  5285), dated July 24th, has been issued by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office. It deals  with  the  position and  prospects of  German sea-power, first  as to naval acquisitions and aims, and, secondly, as to the expansion of the mercantile marine and its part in the reconstruction of German trade.  It is shown that the experience of the present war has not destroyed  Germany&apos;s  ambition  to  attain a greater  measure of naval supremacy^.  Although, except for the submarine, the gates  of the  North Sea and of the Straits of Gibraltar and Otranto have been closed against the German  and Austrian fleets,  inside those gates German sea-power has developed considerably; the retention of Antwerp and Zeebrugge will lead to  improvement of  her inland  water- ways  and. will  give  Germany continuous  control  of  the  waters  from  Jutland  to
Dunkirk ; the Black Sea has become a German preserve;  commercial and shippingagreements  have  been concluded with  Finland,  whose vast resources are now inGerman hands ;  and the position of the Central Bowers in the Eastern  Mediterraneanhas undoubtedly been improved by the acquisition of the Black Sea fleet.    Dealing with Germany&apos;s future war-aims, the opinion is expressed that she will endeavour to retain Kaio-Chau, Samoa, New Guinea, and all her  Pacific Islands; tore build her wireless stations and  expand her bases in German East Africa, and at a peace  Conference to raise  such  questions  as the neutralisation of  the  Straits of gibraltar.  As regards the Suez  Canal, the Pan-Germanic view is  that, in the eventof an indecisive result in the West, the Central  Armies will endeavour to sweep awayour troops in Palestine and Mesopotamia with the Canal as the objective.  In addition,Germany has ambitious schemes  for the control of Central Asia and the re-conquestof Egypt, and although, as the Memorandum points out, &quot; these projects are  at presentin the air, we can ill afford to contemplate any danger, however  remote, to the &apos; spinalcord of the British Empire.&apos; &quot;    In regard to  the  resumption of her overseas trade Germany has already made considerable  preparations.  New  yards  have  been  built,  canals and waterways,particularly those  connecting Germany with her neighbours, have been  developed,and it  is estimated  that  950,000 tons  of  new  shipping  are  now  complete or on the stocks.  In  addition, Germany&apos;s enterprise has been active among her Allies.   un austria, besides  those at San  Rocco  and the  Cantiere  Navale, new  yards  arebeing constructed at Spalato, and both the Austrian-Lloyd and  the Trieste shipping companies are increasing their  fleets.   Shipbuilding activity under German super-vision has also been observed  in  Turkey ;  while  in neutral  countries she has beenextraordinarily enterprising in  investing capital  in shipping  ventures  in order  toobtain control after the war.   Summing up the  evidence  brought forward  in respectof  the  reconstruction   of  the German  mercantile   marine,  the  memorandumconcludes :     &quot; A casual glance at  the  foregoing evidence should sufficiently, demonstrate the determination of the Germans  to repair, in a great  measure, the ravages of war.Their  Government intends  that  the control of German shipping shall enable  theCentral Powers to  control  the destination of goods ; and  sees in the earnings of the mercantile marine an &apos; invisible export&apos; affecting the rate of  exchange in Germany&apos;s favour.   In no sphere connected with shipping have the Central Powers been idle ;they have constructed, new  yards, projected an  elaborate shipbuilding programme,developed the  European  canal  system,  and  imposed  economic regulations uponvarious neutrals.   Despite these preparations there  is for Germany one thing needful to regain the fullest access to the raw  material  for industry.  On  that point theGerman economists  and shipowners  display  distinct apprehension.  They  will endeavour  to  saddle the  treaty of peace with  various supplementary agreements forthe restoration of  their commerce.  Potash and dyes will be set against  cotton  andjute.   Among our enemies the power of an  economic boycott is fully recognised,  andthey are conscious that the resumption of their  overseas trade is  dependent upon theframing of decisions which they are,  at the present time,  unable  to affect.&quot;NEUTRAL  GROUP.                                   DENMARK.    United  States  and  Danish Shipping. Sir  R.  Paget  reports  that  there  are indications that the delay at the Conference between the United States War trade board  and the Danish  delegates at Washington in coming to a decision in regard toDanish  shipping is seriously disturbing the Danish Government, and life is informedthat a meeting was held recently  at which the Swedish  Prime Minister, the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs,  shipping delegates, agricultural delegates and representatives ofAssociations were present.   At this meeting a telegram from the Danish Minister at
AVashingtou was read to the effect that there seemed to he little prospect of an  agree-ment being reached, and that the impression was  that objections were coming from great Britain and France.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs then invited the viewsof the meeting as to what should be done in the circumstances.   One of the speakerspointed  out that they  had to a great extent themselves to. blame for the presentsituation, as no attempt had been made during the last year to keep in touch with theAllies, but that instead the tendency had been to sulk and gravitate.towards Germany,&quot;The speaker  explained that he understood  that the difficulties in the way  of  agree-ment were that the Danes would not concede sufficient tonnage, and that the limits of exports  to  Germany were  fixed too high, and he therefore proposed  that the Danishdelegates at Washington should be instructed to agree to the demands of the  UnitedStates Government in respect of both these matters.     Sir Id. Paget understands that this proposal was agreed to and has been put intoeffect..  Lord  Reading states  that the Danish Minister at Washington has protested tothe War Trade Board against the delay in concluding negotiations, mentioning thathe thought the Board was under the impression that the Danes did not  want to cometo an agreement; in reply he was told that such an impression was entirely wrong asthe Board had always considered the  Danes were  anxious, to come to an agreement provided its terms could be reconciled by them  with their agreement with Germany.ddie Danish Minister then hinted  that the delay -was  clue  to obstruction  by GreatBritain and France, and was  informed that this was not the case.  Lord  Reading hasbeen given to understand that in the course of the last day or two  the Danish delegateshave received full powers to negotiate and sign an agreement, and this apparentlyconfirms the opinion expressed by Sir  R. Paget.  The Danish delegates at Washingtonhave pint in a  detailed memorandum covering the , Allies&apos; latest  offer  of rations, andalthough in nearly all cases they ask for  an increase, Lord Reading thinks that the language of the memorandum would appear to be meant rather as a record that theyprotest against the Allied proposals than as an  indication that they really intend to insist upon their demands being  granted.  Lord  Reading states that  the ShippingBoard anticipates a serious  shortage of ships for the carriage of Army supplies duringthe next  few months.  (See Report No. 79.)                                   FINLAND.     Food Supply. Sir E.  Howard thinks that it  would  be useful, if  a statableopportunity could be found for doing so, to  publish  a recapitulation of  the Allies&apos;food policj^ towards Finland, and he suggests  the lines upon which such a statementmight be drafted, namely,  by  pointing  out that the Associated Governments havenever been opposed to supplying  Finland with food supplies, providing satisfactory-guarantees can be obtained such as have been given by other neutral countries againstre-exportation.   Reference  might be made to  the effect that  when the Allies  wereapproached last summer and autumn by Dr. Ignatius and Dr. von Wendt that  point was made clear to them, and they were informed that the Allies were ready to discussan  arrangement  with  the  Finnish Government  on such lines.  Although they gaveverbal assurances, no real discussion was ever  initiated  by  the Finnish  Government,and therefore no arrangement was arrived at;  thereafter a Socialist Revolution tookplace, followed by civil war, so that no party was in a position to make any satisfactory arrangement;  then came  German occupation and  the Finnish-German  Treaty  ofCommerce which bound Finland economically to Germany;  and, finally, a constantlyincreasing German military force in Finland which made it clear that  the Germansintended to use Finland as  a base of military operations against the Allied Forces onthe Murman Coast.  Consequent^ the Associated Governments cannot  regard Finlandin  the same light  as  other neutral countries,  and they  are therefore  regretfullycompelled to refuse any assistance to Finland as regards facilities  for imports  until,by the withdrawal of German troops, they are satisfied  that Finnish territory will notbe used as a base against them.  If such  a withdrawaPshould take place, and Finlandshould have  maintained a  neutral attitude, the Associated Governments  would beready at once to consider making an arrangement with the Finnish Government onthe lines above  referred to.
                                        9    Proclamation to Finnish Democrats. Russian Wireless  of August 5th publishesthe following proclamation, said to  have been  issued  by the Central Committee ofFinnish  Social  Democrats  addressed   to  Finnish   Democrats : &quot;Anglo-FrenchImperialists have undertaken hostilities against the Russian Soviet Republic, and,having elaborated a plan for an offensive in co-operation with the Russian counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, they follow the tactics of Judas, and under the pretext of friendship  have  organised  a  Czecho-Slovak mutiny and simultaneously commencedan offensive at  Murmansk.   They endeavour to justify these  operations by pretendingresistance to German aggression and  defence of democracy.  The representatives ofImperialism  of these countries  have intrigued  so cleverly that a  section,  of  theRussian and Finnish Comrades really believed that they were acting  in the Murmanregion with  goodwill  toward the  revolutionary movement in  Finland as well astowards the russian Soviet Republic.  As far as we know a considerable number ofFinnish  Social  Democrats, though faithful to  the revolutionary movement, haveenlisted  in the  British  Army in  the belief  that they are thereby  helping  theRevolutionary Workers&apos; Movement, which is now strangled in Finland.     &quot;In consequence we  consider it our duty to declare  that  the RevolutionaryProletariat  has  nothing in  common  with the usurping aspirations  and militaryenterprises of Anglo-French Imperialism any more than it has with those of GermanImperialism.   Their  revolutionary committee  is  an infamous falsity.   Therefore  itis  the  duty of  every Finnish  revolutionary  or  Finnish  ex-Red  Guard  to leaveimmediately the  Anglo-French Imperialist Army, if he has not yet clone so, so  that hemay  remain faithful to the  cause which he  supported  during  the revolutionary movement.   It is considered as a crime against the International, Socialist,  and. SocialRevolutionary  Movement to render direct or indirect help to the Imperialists in theirwarfare against; the Russian Soviet Reptdolic in Russia.  On the  other hand, we Finnsmust support with  all the means  at our disposal the power of the imoletariat and the poor peasants of Russia.&quot;     Deputation  in  Berlin. -German  Wireless  of  August  1st states that  a  Finnish denotation, consisting of the Finnish Envoys in Berlin, the  Councillor of State, Hyelt, Major-General  Ignatius, the  Legation  Councillor von  Bonadorff,  and Major  von Gripenberg, arrived the previous day at the  Headquarters of the Supreme Army Command, and presented  Hindenburg and Luclendorff with the Grand  Cross of the Finnish Cross  of Freedom.   The deputation then  proceeded further into  the theatre of the war.     Finland and  the North. Sir E. Howard  reports on August  3rd that  he  has just  had an interview with Mr.  Westman,  the  Swedish  Minister at Helsingfors, who is in  Stockholm  on leave,  in the course  of  which  he was told that  the Finnish President  and  the   Finnish Foreign Minister   are  certainly anxious  to avoid hostilities.  Mr. Westman said that  he has clone his  best to induce  Finland to i&apos;remain  neutral, as he  believes a conflict would  be  disastrous for the  former and  would create  difficulties  for  Sweden.    He  thinks  the Allies  should  do something  to  allay Finnish suspicions concerning the steps they are  taking on the North Coast, which suspicions, he says, have  been aggravated  by rumours that  it is intended to attack Finland.  He is of opinion, also, that if the Allies could give the assurance  that  they  will not oppose the  realisation  of Finnish aspirations on the Murman  Coast and  East  Karelia, provided Finland  and  Russia  wrere  agreed, the Germans  would be unable to get assistance from the Finns, and  an attack  by Germany on the Murman Coast might  possibly fail.  Mr. Westman suggested that an Allied declaration should  be made on the above lines.      Copper  Exports  to  Germany.  An Admiralty  Memorandum   (No.  318) dated August 1st states  that: &quot; The Germans  are reported  to have  arranged for the import of 25,000 tons of  copper ore from the Outu Kumpa mines  in Finland, where there are some 6,000,000 tons of ore immediately in sight,  and 20,000,000 tons of ore in reserve.  These mines have been worked  on a small  scale  during the  last few years.  Last April the  Finnish Government  informed the manager that the mines were to be worked to their  full capacity at once, in order that the  ore might be shipped to Germany in exchange for  foodstuffs.   On the manageFs refusal, the mines were expropriated for  the period  of the  war. It is doubtful whether conditions in Finland are sufficiently settled for a large output to be maintained.&quot;.      6273-lb                              c
                               NETHERLANDS.    German-Dutch  Coal Agreement. An official statement has been issued at ddieHague (July 31st) in regard to an. arrangement for the importation of German steamcoal to Holland.   Sir W. Townley states that this  arrangement provides that from august 1st, for a period of five months, Germany shall furnish Holland with  120,000tons of coal monthly at 90 florins per ton, hut a credit of 30  florins per ton  will be given.  Sir W. Townley learns  that all coal  so supplied  is to he suitable  for gasmaking, and no Belgian coal  of  any kind is to  be supplied under  this agreement.Germany understands that when the new Dutch  Government is formed, negotiationswill be resumed for a general economic agreement between  the two countries ; it has,therefore,  stipulated that the coal agreement just concluded may be cancelled, afterOctober 15th,  provided  a fortnights  notice  is  given.   This  arrangement,  Sir W.Townley points out in a despatch of August 3rd,  constitutes an extremely clever move on Germany&apos;s part, as it must tend to a very great extent to  force the hands of thenew Dutch Cabinet towards concluding a general economic  agreement with Germany,because it would be difficult for a new Government  during October  or  thereafter  to admit to  the public  that  negotiations  with Germany had broken down, andconsequently no more coal from there must be expected.    Anglo-Dutch  Negotiations. Sir W. Townley reports anxiety  on the part of theDutch to resume negotiations with. His  Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to shippingmatters.   He  has  received a comimmication  from the Dutch  Minister for  ForeignAffairs, stating that it is deemed to be of the utmost  importance  that  an agreement should be come to as soon as possible.    Formation of  Neio Cabinet. According  to  Sir W. Townley, the present dutch government expected,  as a result of the General  Election, to be relieved  of their responsibility  a few weeks ago, but the domestic situation is  so involved  that theformation of a new Cabinet is being constantly delayed.  (See Report No. 79.)  .                                   NORWAY.    Shipping  Mission  in  Berlin. Mr.  Ovey is  informed  by the Norwegian ForeignMinister that the deputation consisting of representatives of the Norwegian-AmericanLine,  the Shipowners&apos; Association, the Northern Shipowners&apos; Association, the Ministryof Foreign Affairs and the State Chartering Department, which recently went to Berlin,will probably conclude their negotiations this  week.  (See Report  No. 79.)  TheMinister does not  expect much result from the  Mission, but  evidently anticipates thatfree passage will be given to the  ships Bergensfjord and Stavangerfjord,  to loadfoodstuffs  for  purely Norwegian consumption.  He does not, however, fear, in theevent  of such an arrangement, that the  Germans will reserve the right promiscuouslyto sink other vessels outside the  danger zone.   Mr. Ovey submits  that the proposedAllied declaration regarding the question of  German &quot;safe-conducts&quot;  should becommunicated to the Norwegian  Government before the latter is in any way bound by the anticipated agreement with Germany.   A summary (G.T. 5306) states that thedeputation will also negotiate for the conclusion  of  a  commercial agreement betweenthe two countries.    German   Submarines  in Norwegian Territorial Waters. ddie Foreign  Officeinstructs  Mr.  Ovey  to make representations  to the  Norwegian Government on thesubject of the use of Norwegian territorial waters by German submarines.   He is topoint out  that belligerent submarines are prohibited  by Norwegian  Royal Decree ofOctober  13th, .1916, from using such territorial waters except  under bad  weather conditions, and although British submarines have strictly carried out this decree, theAdmiralty is  reliably informed that German  submarines  constantly use these waterson  their way to and from the Atlantic.   The Norwegian Government is to be  askedto take steps to enforce the Royal Decree equally in the  case of all the belligerents.                                    RUMANIA.     Prisoners of War in Russia. Mr. Hodgson reports that the number of Rumanian. prisoners of war in European Russia is estimated to be 60,000, and in Siberia 20,000.
                                     SPAIN.    Family of ex-Czar. Sir A. Hardinge is reliably  informed that, on the personalinitiative  of the King of Spain, steps  are  being  taken to bring the family of theex-Emperor of Russia to Spain, and German  Wireless  of  7th  August states  that,according  to  the  Hamburger Fremdenblatt, the Bolshevist Government has agreedto their release subject to certain, guarantees which are still the subject of negotiation.    Relations with Belligerents. Sir A. Hardinge says there is no doubt the SpanishGovernment has  been greatly impressed by the Allied successes  in Prance and the rapid growth  of the  United States military power,  while on the  other  hand deepresentment has been caused by the sinking of Spanish vessels.   He notes indications that the Spanish Government is contemplating action which may  lead to a rupture of relations  with Germany.  In fact, he  is authoritatively  informed  that the SpanishMinisters of State and Finance threaten to resign if definite action is not taken soonin regard  to  the German torpedoing of Spanish shipping.   They intend raising thequestion  at the next Cabinet meeting, and  to propose that all Spanish merchantvessels be armed for  defence, and  whenever possible that they be sent with Alliedconvoys.   The Minister of State expects to be supported in his  attitude by  other ministers.                                   SWEDEN.    The Swedish-Allied Agreement. In a despatch dated August 2nd, Sir E. Howardstates that the Swedish Opposition Press are clamouring for the publication  of theSwedish-Allied Agreement, and  that  die Government  appeared  to  be shelteringbehind an alleged wish of the Associated Governments for secrecy.  Sir E. Howardthinks it might be useful to draw attention to the fact that it was rather the wish ofthe Swedish Government to publish as  little as possible  about the agreement, and ifthey are anxious to say more about  it, the Associated Governments would have noobjection on condition that any communique is drawn up after consultation with thelatter.   The Foreign Office approves of this course being taken.  Commenting on thissubject, the Stochholm-Tidning  of  August  2nd emphasises  the general discontentwhich has been caused  by the scanty information which has been  made  public, andthis secrecy, in. view of the statements  recently made  by the  Swedish Government, itnaturally ascribes  to  the Associated Governments.   In connection with this matter,Sir E.  Howard  forwards  a summary  of  a  protest published  in  the  Swedish-Press   by Marcus  Wallenberg  against  attacks,  for  party  purposes,  on  theSwedish-Allied Agreement.  The protest  points out  that when it became apparent that the war would  be  prolonged  and&quot; consequently  result  in difficulties  asto  food  supply  it  became  imperative  that  the  Swedish  Government  shouldtake steps to meet the situation ;  and that in order  to  have all its  requirements metit was  essential that certain concessions  should be made, the only question  beingwhether the advantage to be gained  was worth the sacrifices demanded.   In 1915 and1917 the Swedish Government then in  power regarded the  sacrifices demanded as too great, but the  bad harvest  of  1917  and the increasing  diminution of imported supplies led the present Government to initiate negotiations in London last December,which,  however, were not concluded until May 29th, 1918.   M. Wallenberg refers tothe tenacity with which the Swedish negotiators in  London combated conditions     0273- u                            the Rumanian Government appointed six Commissioners to  deal with  the questionof rendering them assistance, and - three of  these Commissions are working in Siberia,together with ten officers who, have been  sent  there for propaganda purposes.  Mr.Hodgson is informed by members of the Commission at Vladivostock that the prisonersof war can be  relied upon to join the Allies in  case of intervention, and he inquireswhether His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared  to support this movement.    Food Conditions. Lord Derby reports (July 31st) that he has received a telegramfrom the Allied Representatives at Jassy dated  July 25th stating that the daily breadration has been reduced from 500 to 250 grammes.
which were oppressive to Sweden, frequently gaining their point, and that finally a deadlock was reached in. which the Swedish Government either had to take or leave.the agreement.   It  chose the former course,  and in view of  the ever  increasing-shortage of foodstuffs in Sweden,  every responsible person would have  done the same.M. Wallenberg submits the proposal that attacks on  the  agreement should . be post-ponecl until it can be seen what its result is, because such attacks undoubtedly makethe situation niore difficult for Sweden in connection with the exchanges  of opinion between the Swedish Government and the  Allied and Central Powers, and they mayendanger the most  vital interests  of the  country.   (And  see  Reports Nos. 71-73and 78.)    Proposed  Visit to England of Social Revolutionary Party. Sir E.  Howard is  ofopinion that permission should be given to  Colonel Cyon to accompany the  delegation of the Social Revolutionary Party which, contemplates  a visit to England.  (See ReportNo. 79.)  Sir E. Howard states that his  activities since  he has been in Stockholmhave  certainly been anti-German,  and he thinks that it would be  wise to allow him  togo, unless there is anything more serious against him  than  a suspicion that  he maybe engaged in pacifist propaganda.                                SWITZERLAND.     Economic Policy and prolongation of the War. Sir H.  Rumbold learns from areliable source that the Swiss economic policy was adversely criticised at  a recent meeting of the Federal Council, and  in defending  himself from the reproach that hehad not taken sufficiently into account the prolongation of the war, M. Schulthess, theMinister  of National Econonry, stated that  the Swiss General  Staff, whom he  had consulted from time to time, had  always informed him that it was a mathematical.certainty that Germany would win  the war.   They had  also stated  on  various occasions  that a  final  German  victory  was only  a  matter   of a  few  months.M. Schulthess now,admitted wdth regret that the information he had  received, hadmisled him,  and  that  the  Swiss General  Staff  no  longer believed  that germany would win  the war.     Proposed Increase of  Capitation Hate  for  interned British in Switzerland. -With regard  to a proposed increase in the capitation rate paid for British  civilians inSwitzerland,  the  Foreign  Office informs Sir H.  Rumbold  that the Army Councilrequires additional information before it can decide the question.  It is  suggested,therefore, that a Conference consisting of British, French and Belgian representatives should meet at Berne  to discuss the  matter, taking specially into  consideration thecost  of living in Switzerland, the profits made by hotel keepers under the existingrate,  and  the possibility of reducing the cost by concentrating  interned  officers infewer  hotels.  The  Army Council  wishes   the  Conference to  make  a  definiterecommendation regarding the desirability of the proposed increase, and  desires themto find out  what attitude the German Government has adopted in connection with thismatter.   Sir  H. Rumbold has carried  out the Foreign Office  suggestion and reports on August  3rd that the Conference has met  and the opinion was expressed that anincrease of half a franc a  day should,  meet the case, and  that  a  number  of the half-empty internment hotels  should  be  closed  clown.  He anticipates that  theConference will arrive at its final conclusions about August 8th.PEACE DISCUSSIONS,     During the week under review the progress of the operations  on the Vesle hasbeen watched all. over the world too eagerly to allow for any serious  discussion of ageneral peace ; and it is unlikely that any such discussion wall be renewed until afterthe close of this phase of the military operations.     Finland. ddie representatives of Finland and  the Bolshevist  Government havearrived  in Berlin.   Finland  is  represented by  M.  Inckell,   the  Bolshevists  byM. Vorovsky.                     v
     In expressing  to  the  Finnish representative  his  thanks for the Grand Cross ofthe Finnish  Cross of Freedom  which had  been conferred upon  him, the GermanEmperor  expressed the hope  that  &quot; the  bonds of sympathy which have for longlimited the two peoples may be  strengthened by the fight which  Germans  and Finnshave waged together on the fields of Finland.&quot;   He  further claimed to  have achieved&quot; without manv words but by deeds the protection of  the small nations in  their fight for liberty.&quot;    . The  first meeting of  the  Conference took place on  the  3rd August  when theproceedings were opened with a speech by von Stumm, Under Secretary for ForeignAffairs, who claimed  that &quot;in accordance with  the  principle of the  right of self-determination  the  Russian Soviet  Republic has  replied  to  the declaration  of theindependence of Finland wdth a recognition of the independence of the  Finnish State,and thereby the separation of Finland, from  Russia has  de facto been completed.&quot;Since, however, several outstanding  territorial, judicial, and  economic  questions hackto be settled representatives of  the two countries had been invited to Berlin where he now welcomed them in the name  of the  Imperial  Government.   He  concluded  his remarks  by offering  his  own  services and those of the Imperial Government  in settling any differences which might arise in  the course of the negotiations.     To this speech the representatives of the two parties  replied  in suitable  terms,especially acknowledging  their  indebtedness  to  the Imperial  Government for  itsgenerosity in interesting itself in the affairs of Finland.     Germany. Berlin   newspapers comment  upon  the  generally   unfavourablereception of Lord  Lansclowne&apos;s  last letter by the British  Press.     On  the  31st  July, in the  Bavarian Chamber, the President, von Dandl, in  ageneral  survey  of the results of four  years of  war, tried to  prove  that  GreatBritain was attempting &quot; completely to encircle Europe by cutting it off from the sea,to procure for themselves important spheres  of influence, and finally to  safeguard  theland route to India.  A glance  at  Salonika, a gate of invasion into the Balkans, andat the islands off the Dardanelles ;  a glance at Syria, Arabia and  Mesopotamia, whichare to safeguard the land  route to India ;  a glance at the Lofoten Islands and  theMurman Coast, which are to close the circle in the North, are sufficient  proof of this fact.&quot;  According  to the president. therefore,  Great Britain is forcing Germany intoa fifth year of  war but, &quot; If Mr.  Wilson wdth his League of Nations is pursuing the aim that, by its means, a  balance of power shall be established, in the world  on thebasis of the principle of right  . .  . then indeed we can come to an  understanding with him.  All we Avant is the  establishment of a balance of power, freedom for  thedevelojnnent  of every country, freedom of commerce, and freedom  of the seas.  a league of Nations  on  this principle would  be  the most beautiful  crown in the workof peace.&quot;
