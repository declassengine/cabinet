.SEORET. .  APPREOJ AT I ON  OF  TEE  ATTACHED WESTERN  AND GENERAL                               REPORT  No.  86.                      PART II.-FOREIGN AND GENERAL.                          PEACE DISCUSSIONS (page 12).    It lias been found necessary this week to embody some of  the appreciation in the text  of the Report itself.  (See- pages  12-14.)   Put briefly, the balance of evidenceseems to favour the following view :                                 -    Central Powers. Peace discussion at the present stage is adopted as a war measure,on the principle, advocated by  Clausewitz, of making peace immediately in order toavoid the disasters resulting from the  violent reaction, which  always  sets in after an unsuccessful  offensive.   By such means it may be possible to  retain the territory andplunder gained by an invasion, and even to increase them by bluffing  an enemy, wdiomay not realise the  situation.   Comparison  between German deeds  and Austrianwords, since the acceptance by  Count Czernin at Brest-Litovsk (Reports 48-49) of theprinciple of no annexations or indemnities, suffices to discredit all offers  to  discusspeace not supported by guarantees.     Germany. The objects of the German Government  seem  to  have been (1) tocreate a  &quot;peace atmosphere,&quot; in the hope of producing an effect in opposing nations,especially upon people  with   an international, as opposed  to a patriotic, outlook ;(2) to make a separate and direct approach to Belgium, hoping that Belgians  in theGerman grip have now been reduced to such, a desperate condition as to make peaceimperative, if the remnants of the population  are to be  rescued from the horror of their position ;  (3) to make no other  direct offers to  the Entente Powers until the tide of  advance of the Allied armies  on the  Western  Front had  reached  heavily fortified lines,  and had  thereby, for the time, been  delayed ;  but (4) to make every endeavour to prevail upon Neutrals to  offer mediation.   (See  under  Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and  Vatican.)   Referring to heading (2),  the  intention would  be  to throw, if possible, upon  the Allies the moral responsibility for  BelgiunPs  further sufferings.     Austria-Hungary. Owing  to pressing  internal  troubles, the Government was apparently unable to face further delay in making a direct approach, and issued the Vienna Note, soliciting Neutral support for it, and informing the German Government of the action taken.  Doubt is thrown upon  this interpretation by its corroboration by German Wireless, which is not addicted to accuracy. Comparison of the dates of publication of the Note in Holland, Germany, and Great Britain is interesting.     For the rest, the disclosure by the Frankfurter Zeitung of the  enemy impetus behind the movement for International Labour and Socialist Conferences is important. The prediction by the late Sir  C. Spring Rice (see  Report  No.  50) that Germany would try to use all international movements, outside  Germany,  to  help her to win the war, while sternly suppressing such movements in her  own country, and insisting upon patriotism, has since been  amply fulfilled.

The  state  of  tension continues, and may be expected  toincrease,  because it  is caused  by the fact that the truth  is  now  beginning, with increased force, to breakthrough the  tissue of falsehood,  upon which the  confidence of the German people has hitherto  been based.

PART  II.-FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.    Sinkings. According  to the War Trade Intelligence Bureau, the total tonnageof 500 tons gross in the case of  steamers, and 100 tons gross  in  the  case  of sailing-ships, reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during  the periodSeptember 6th-12th inclusive, was 41,363 tons.gross,  of which 35.319 were  British,as compared  with  50,328 tons  gross, of which  27,051 were  British, reported lastweek.                                                                         v    The Admiralty reports : &quot; The losses of  world tonnage in August, due to enemy action, remain at about the average of the last few months, but  if British losses aloneare considered the tonnage sunk by  the enemy in August was  considerably less thanin any month since September  1916, and is even less than the corresponding  losses sustained in August 1915.&quot;  The daily average of British tonnage sunk during Augustwas &quot; considerably  less  than in any previous month  since  the commencement  ofunrestricted submarine  warfare.&quot;  . . . .  &quot;Notwithstanding the reduction in tonnagelosses by enemy action in August,  there is a net loss of  British  tonnage to record for.the month.  This is due partly to a greater tonnage than usual having been lost owdngto ordinary marine casualty, and partly to the restricted output of new vessels.   Thetonnage  transferred from foreign  flags,  also, has now fallen  to a very low figure.Owing, however, to  a further reduction during the month of about 10 per cent, in theBritish tonnage under and  awaiting heavy repairs, the British tonnage available for service was greater by nearly 30,000 tons at the end than at  the beginning of  themonth.&quot;    German  Estimate of Italian  Shipping Losses. German Wireless of September15th states :  &quot;So far during; the war Italy has lost  320 steamers with a total tonnageof 1,170,000 tons.  At  the beginning of May,  the Italian fleet amounted only  to275 steamers wdth an  aggregate  tonnage  of 1,020,000 tons.  Italy has not been ableto replace 20 per cent, of the losses suffered by her during the war.&quot;    Allied Maritime  Transport  Council :  Japanese  Representation  invited. TheAllied Maritime Transport  Council has invited the  Japanese Government  to  berepresented upon the Council.  The  invitation records  the  objects and powers of  theCouncil (see Reports Nos. 47, 50, 54,  and 62).    Coed Position. The Ministry of  Shipping reports that there is still a considerableshortage in the amount of coal available for export,  as  compared with  the  wholeprogramme.   Though few ships are   waiting for  coal and  none are now being sentaway in ballast, it must be emphasised that this position is due, not to a sufficiency ofcoal being available, but to the fact that a large quantity of tonnage sent away during july and August in ballast for want  of coal has not yet returned.    See also Memorandum G.T.  5533 by  the Ministry of Labour.    Reprisals. Reprisals taken by  the British and German  Governments since thebeginning of  the  war are summarised  in  a Memorandum   (G.T. 5675)  under  covering  letter, elated  September  12th,  from  Lord  Newton.  The Memorandumconcludes  that  the British have  been less  successful in  collective than individualreprisals, and that  the Germans  will go to  extremes at  which (as they  know) theBritish will  hesitate.  Lord Newton qualifies this by observing that the Germantreatment  of prisoners  varies in accordance with the course of the war ; and that asthe British have,  since  the  Memorandum  was  written, obtained  a  considerablemajority of combatant  prisoners (apart  from the majority of  civilians already  held),it is probable that  the Germans wdll now be more amenable to threats of retaliationthan at any time in  the past.
    Parcels for  British  Prisoners of War  in  Belgium. -The  Foreign Office  isrequesting the Netherlands Government to ascertain whether the German Governmentwill arrange for a  distributing centre in Belgium, from which  parcels  can be forwarded to British prisoners  who have  been sent direct from the front to work in belgium.   It is also desired that lists of such prisoners should be furnished as soonas possible after capture.     Repatriation of British Prisoners from Bulgaria. Arrangements have been madefor the conveyance through Switzerland and France of 81 Bidtish prisoners repatriatedfrom Bulgaria.     Repatriation under Anglo Turkish and  Franco-Turkish Agreements. Lord Derbyreports  the arrangements  made by the  Ottoman Government  for repatriation ofFrench  and  Ottoman prisoners of war  and  civilians under the. Franco-TurkishAgreement.  He  transmits  an  enquiry  by the French Government as to whether his Majesty:s  Government has  received similar  notification from  the ottoman government, in which case the British and  French Governments might agree upona vessel for simultaneous repatriation.  The Netherlands Government has transmittedthe conditions under which the German  Government will guarantee immunity to the transports  employed.  These include  the [sale of the vessels to the  netherlands government for the period of the war.     German  Propaganda  regarding Turkish  Prisoners  in  England. The DailyReview  quotes  a letter published on July 22nd in the Osmanische Lloyd over the signature  of Helmuth Reinhardt, of Magdebourg, who declares  he has  just  been released after 3-i- years&apos; captivity  in  England,  where he  was interpreter  for theTurkish prisoners of war  in the Isle of Man.   &quot; .  . .  .  The  food supply becoming-more and more difficult, the food question in  the various prisoner of war  camps inEngland was so much  aggravated that the majority of  those  interned are  now wornout  in  body and mind owing  to  insufficient  nourishment.  Housed in a  mostinhuman manner in  small and miserable quarters, our prisoners are the prey of themost terrible privations, and more  than one victim of the  English  civilisation havealready been, buried  in the desert Island of  Man.....In  spite  of  this frightfulstate of things I have never heard any hut  the mildest complaint against the TurkishGovernment, and never any movement of opposition.&quot;ALLIED  GROUP.                                  BELGIUM.    The Flemish Movement. The Daily  Review of September 1.1th quotes a longmemorandum by van Gauwelaert on the Flemish question.  Van Cauwelaert represents the passive Flamingants as opposed to  the Activists, and  his  memorandum gives  a fairly complete statement of the Flemish case  as  conceived by himself and  thoseFlemings [e.g., the Vlaamsch-Belgisch Verbond in Holland) who hold with him.  Thispolicy aims at a Flemish country within the Belgian State unity (without administra-tive separation), with the use of  its  own language in  administration., and wdth fullfreedom to  develop its peculiar character and culture,  by such measures as  theFlamandising of the University of Ghent,  &amp;c.  The programme includes a separation of Flemish and Walloon units in the  army.  &quot; Neither Belgium nor the  Allies have any interest in leaving the  impression on the Flemings that they  are  despised orsuspected, and in leaving them without counterpoise to  the attraction  of  Germany.&quot;The sympathy of Great Britain is especially invited,  (And see Reports Nos. 52, 54, 59,65, 70, 72, 74-76, and 82.)    German  Treatment  of  Occupied  Belgium. A report  drawn  up  in  occupiedBelgium at the end of May is summarised as follows by the Daily Review from theInformations Beiges, which states it has constant confirmation in detail of the facts-stated :  &quot;The pillage is methodically organised on a carefully studied system. Its aim isthe exhaustion of the country, the destruction of all its resources, industrial, commercial,
financial, agricultural, &amp;c.   In 1914-15, von der Goltz and von Hissing attempted to convince the Belgians of the good intentions of Germany, and to persuade  them tore-establish commercial and  industrial activity.   Their aim in  this soon  came to light.  The  partial  resumption  of  activity  enabled  them  to  lay hands  on the -manufactured  products,  the  stocks of  raw  materials, machines,  tools,  factories.(1) ddie Budget ought to  be used only for the needs and the administration  of the occupied territories.   In fact, more than FT. S0,000,000 are  entered  on it every year for objects that serve only German interests : Administrative Separation, the Councilof Flanders, &amp;c.  To cover the deficit the Germans impose new taxes.  (2)  A warcontribution of Fr. 40,000,000 monthly was imposed on  Belgium for  the maintenanceof the army of occupation.  It was increased in 1916, first to 50, then to  60  millions.There is  talk  of  an increase  to  75 millions.  (3) Numerous war contributions areexacted from the communes.  Brussels has paid Fr. 50,000,000, Tournai Fr. 2,000,000,Antwerp Fr. 50,000,000, Liege Fr. 20,000,000, &amp;c. (4) Fines rain down on the communesand on individuals.   The sum of  these now amounts to  some millions of marks,  ddiemost trivial incidents serve as  excuses for  fines,  ddie national fete of duly 21st, 1916,celebrated in  Brussels by silence and  meditation, cost  that city Mk. 2,000,000 fine.ddie most disproportionate fines have been inflicted on individuals ; Mk. 100 to  10,000for  omitting to deliver the quantity of potatoes requisitioned,  Mk. 100  to 1,000  forgiving potatoes as^ fodder to  cattle, Mk.  1,000 to  10,000 for corresponding with arelative abroad or at the front, Mk. 1,000  to 25,000 for  helping  a son or a relative to escape from Belgium, Mk. 500 to  5,000 for  being found  in  possession  of a copy- ofLa Libre  Belgique or other prohibited paper, Mk.  1,000 for  having  reproduced on aduplicator  translations from  Dutch papers,  &amp;c.   These  fines  are nearly alwaysaccompanied by imprisonment.  (5) ddie requisitions are  nothing  else  but confiscations.The owners  themselves have to deliver the articles requisitioned, which are  paid  for at  a nominal  rate.   If the)-  do   not, domiciliary  visitations are made wdth  everycircumstance of brutality,  ddie list of requisitions increases  every day, embracingevery article  of  metal,  wool, linen, tobacco, horses,  cattle,  motors,  clothes, &amp;c.industry,  commerce, agriculture,  individuals,  all  are robbed.  (6)  Special  bureaux,known as &apos; Zentralen,&apos; carry off all the products of the soil:  coal, butter, potatoes, &amp;c.ddie result is that prices have gone  up to a fabulous extent, butter is Fr. 35 per kilo.,potatoes Fr. 2 per  kilo,   ddie result is there  is a regular  clandestine  traffic  &quot;whichoften has fatal results.  (7) Industrial firms are asked to work for the German Army.If they refuse to serve the interests of Germany, their establishments are sequestrated andexploited by German functionaries, or directly by the army. In many regions, notably inthe north of France, pillage  is followed  by  destruction. Russian  prisoners are set to work with picks  and hammers to destroy the  buildings,   ddie machines, &amp;o, are taken down.  The  tools  go  to Germany,  ddre factories are then  levelled  to  theground.   (8) A decree of 1917 forbids any industrial establishment  to use more than12 workers, or a motor  power  above 5 horse-power.  This  measure  put all theindustries under  German control.   Many establishments were  closed, thousands ofAvorkers  were  thrown into the street.  The  unemployed were  then asked to signcontracts  to work in Germany,  ddie most  alluring promises have been made to  attractBelgian workers to Germany.  But many, vdieu they go there, soon return to Belgiumor  escapie into Holland.   (9) In  spite of the solemn  promises of the Kaiser, the intervention of the  Pope,  the King of Spain, and the neutrals, forced labour hascontinued on the lines of  communication.  Men from 15 to 60  are called up.   Some300 to 350  in the  thousand are  declared valid, vaccinated  against typhoid, packedlike  beasts  in carts,  without food, and despatched  to France.   There  they  areemployed  in cleaning trenches, cutting down  trees, &amp;c. ; the younger  among themwork in  the factories.  If they refuse, they are tortured. (10) German  troops  distalthemselves in the houses of the Belgians.                                    BRAZIL.     Brazilian  Finances. Mr.  Barclay  reports  that  a discussion is imminent  atWashington as to the amount required by Brazil in order to  meet its obligations [seeReports Nos. 79 and 85), and the form in which financial assistance should be offered.Apart from the possibility  of  independent action &quot;by  the  bbiited  States, it  is  forconsideration whether such assistance should take the form  of (1) direct loans by the
Associated Governments, (2) credits  by Banks in  the  United States and allied countries, or (3) credits by an Interallied organisation. - (See Reports Nos. 69, 71, 7576, 79 and 84.)                                    CHINA.    Great Britain and the new Presidevt.Siv J. Jordan on September 16th convej-to  the  new President (see Report No.  85) the congratulations  of His  Majesty&apos;s-Government upon his election.   The President appeared much gratified and returneda message of sincere thanks.    North and South. The Foreign Office is instructing Sir C. Greene to approach the Japanese  Government with a view to its.joining  with the Associated Powers in pressing the Chinese Northern Government (on lines indicated in Report No. 85) tocompose its differences with the South.  It  is  suggested that, simultaneously wdthsuch joint action, a strong protest  might be addressed to the Government at Cantonagainst  the  appropriation by the Southern Party of the salt revenues, and a warning that the four  Governments are determined not to allow the  seizure of the  customs revenue.    Tibet. Sir J. Jordan submits that  a warning should be  addressed to the DalaiLama against military ambitions at the expense of China.    Export  of Cotton Cloth into Russian Turkestan. His. Majesty&apos;s Consul-General atKashgar suggests that the Chinese  authorities  should  be requested to  prohibit the exportation  of cotton cloth from Chinese into Russian dmrkestan.   He considers thatsuch supplies facilitate the release of corresponding quantities for hostile consumption.(See also under &quot; Germany &quot; below and in Report No. 85.)                                    ITALY.    Baron Sonnino and the Jugo-Slavs. In a despatch dated September 1st Mr. Erskinereports  that the suspicion, if not hostility, felt towards the Slav aspirations on the adriatic is still deep, and that the conviction is widespread that it would be dangerousfor Italy to abandon the pledges secured to her by the Treaty of  London.  Inese senti-ments have been strengthened by  reports published in Rome regarding the Conferenceof Laibach (see Report No. 84 under &quot; AustriaJdungaiy &quot;), which is stated to have put forward exaggerated  Slav pretensions irreconcilable wdth  Italian claims, and tohave  advocated a policy of  independence under  the Hapsburg Crown.   It  wouldappear  that Baron Sonnino is much exercised at the danger of the  incorporation inGermany  of the German  provinces of Austria, feeling that such a State would, be a far more  dangerous neighbour to  Italy than an Austria consisting of a federation of states in which the  Slav element  would largely, predominate;  it is  possible  that  thisapprehension, is the real secret of his reluctance to encourage the idea of the complete independence of  the  Jugo-Sfavs.  According to later  information, however, receivedby Mr.  Erskine from a good source, Baron Sonnino, yielding to  strong representations by his colleagues, has  now consented to discuss wdth the Associated Governments thepirblication of a declaration approving the establishment of a free Jugo-Slav State.    (And see Report No. 83.)   (And see under &quot; General.&quot;)                                    JAPAN.    Position of Government. Sir C. Gfreene reports that the Japanese Governmentis  now expected to resign almost immediately, its decision having been expedited  bythe rice  riots (see Report No. 82) and the  hostile criticism of practically the entirePress.  From the point of view of Marshal Terauchi,the progress achieved in Siberiaaffords  a not  unfavourable occasion.  Discussions are proceeding  with the Genroregarding an alternative administration.   It  is thought  that  Saionji, ex-President ofthe Seiyukai, wdll become  President, wdth  a  Cabinet largely composed from that party.    6463-36                             B                       .   -
    Death of Viscount Motono. Sir G. Greene reports the death on September 17thof Viscount Motono, formerly Minister for Foreign Affairs.                      UNITED  STATES  OF  AMERICA.     Cotton.- On September 5th the War Intelligence Board published the followingnotice : &quot; The announcement of another short crop of  cotton raises in an acute formthe problem of satisfying the needs of the nation as well  as  those  of the Allies andof securing an  equitable distribution for the purpose of winning the war.  Involvedin distribution is the problem of bringing about a reasonable stabilisation of prices in the interest of both producer and consumer.  With the approval of the President,the War Intelligence Board will appoint a committee to study the present  situation,the problems  of distribution, marketing  of  low  grade cottons, and  desirability andfeasibility of effecting a stabilisation of  prices.....&quot;   Mr.  Barclay reports thatof the estimated out-turn (11,000,000 bales) a larger proportion than usual wdll  be  of lower grade.   This will  increase the  already existing accumulation due to the closing of the German market and the exclusion of lower grades  by  army specifications.  Onthe other hand prices for the finer grades  threaten to  rise  owing  to  active buying,partly speculative, partly, it is  believed, on dapanese account, and  also  possibly by enemy interests.  Rationing  by grades and  mixture of grades  are  therefore being-considered.   Meanwhile  the  views of His Majesty&apos;s Government  are invited,  andMr. Baruch hints at the possibility of  a considerable order to  British mills.ENEMY GROUP.                                   GERMANY.     The Chancellorship and Democracy. The  opinion  of Herr Bauer, editor of the Bale National Zeitung, regarding the rumoured impending change in the German Chancellorship (see Reports Nos. 84 and 85) is communicated as follows : Whether or no Solf succeeds Hertling, neither that nor any other change is of any importance so long as Ludendorff remains in office.  Germany hopes  that foreigners would see in Solf&apos;s appointment signs of a movement towards democracy.  Such an appointment would in fact signify the last step in the degradation  of the  Chancellorship.  Any Chancellor at present  is a mere  dependent of  the General Staff:  and Solf is annntitled, bureaucrat  with  no  outstanding qualifications.   The  clemocratisation of Germany is impossible while Ludendorff is master of Germany.     State  of Feeling  in Germany. Indications of a nervous condition in  Germany are furnished by  von Hindenburg&apos;s manifesto of September  2nd, von Linsingen&apos;s placards in Berlin, and the  recent  interview given by von Stein,  all directed  against the circulation of reports  based  on Allied   victories or  Allied  propaganda.   A Memorandum (G.d\ 5687, dated September 14th) by  the Enemy Propaganda Depart- ment states that a  large proportion of recently captured prisoners were found to have British propaganda leaflets in their  possession, and concludes from the indications above-mentioned  that these leaflets find their way  effectively  into the  interior. Reports received by the Foreign Office from neutral countries state that the  morale of German private soldiers is getting very low :  many soldiers told one informant  that they would murder their officers if they dared.   Minor military outbreaks are now of frequent  occurrence.   In several cases regiments have  refused to leave for  the front. It is also stated on good authority  that a  considerable section  of the officer caste is already  envisaging defeat,   ddie military authorities are ruling  with an iron hand ; strikes and riots are  at once quelled with machine guns, without recourse to the police.
                                        (Government spies are active, e.g., in Hamburg, where people are very shy of being seen in conversation.  On the occasion of the Kaiser&apos;s recent visit to the Krupp works, hisaudience of workmen was carefully selected: nevertheless, his speech.was  received with several manifestations of disapproval  and dissent.   Vonodrts of September 10threproduces a stern memorandum  addressed by  the German  Socialist  Party  andthe Trades Unions of Germany to the  Imperial Chancellor on the food situation.   Itpoints out that  similar representations have frequently been made  before without result.  &quot; The conditions of existence  among the  working classes have thus growncontinually  worse.....Prolonged underfeeding  not only produces  increasedmortality  among children  and  old  people,  but  men  and  women of the  working-classes are suffering  most grievously in health.&quot;   After referring  to  the faults andabuses in  food  distribution, the memorandum  concludes :  &quot; The  Government is notunaware of the feeling among  the  population, and it  should,  not be indifferent  toit.  There can  be no doubt  we are drifting towards a situation which is  bound  tobecome fatal if the Government does not  finally resolve to abandon  all favouring  of producers arid take the vital needs of the  people  into account.&quot;  The Government isfurther employed in sustaining the confidence of its  Allies.  Von  Hiutze,  while at  Vienna  (see Report  No. 85),  enlarged upon, the political differences  betweenthe Associated Powers, especially with regard to Russia ; explained that the american troops could not endure  continuous fighting ;  confided that the Allied losses were much greater than was generally known ;  and finally asserted that  the German high command had complete assurance and control of the situation.  Talaat&apos;s  mission  inBerlin is  said, to be recommending  peace.  Turks now  or recently  in Switzerlandexpress the view that the governing classes both  in Germany and Turkey are  ineffect engaged in staving  off  the indignation of their  peoples.  Reports still  agreethat in spite of war weariness and depression,  no revolution can be expected  inGermany unless the Army revolts.   (And see under &quot;Finland.&quot;)    Supplies from Russia. A Despatch (1506S3) dated  August 14th from Petrograd,reports that there seems to be an agreement between the Germans and the Bolshevists,whereby metals  and textiles are to  be  sent  to Germany  in exchange for about200,000 tons of coal; 140 waggons of textiles are said to have already left Moscow for germany.  Another report (M.I. 6 B. No.  715)  states that in addition to textiles, theGermans  are  laying special stress  on obtaining  rubber  and asbestos.  A Russianexport licence for about S00 tons of rubber and about 100 tons of asbestos is said  tohave been granted on July 24th^Creyix\any is asking for  8,000,000 roubles  worth  of rubber tyres and steam packings, which are  believed to be in stock at the Treugolnikand Provodnik works.

                                  DENMARK.   -    Meeting of Scandinavian Kings. Sir R. Paget  learns that the Kings of norway and Sweden will  probably visit  Copenhagen  on September 25th. ,  According to the danish Foreign Minister the visit will be of an entirely non-political character (and see under &quot; Sweden &quot;).                                   FINLAND.    Finland and the North. In a despatch dated August 26th Sir E. Howard refers to an  article in -the Finnish newspaper Da gens  Press showing an acute disillusionmentin regard  to the Karelian question.  Finland had  believed, says the writer,  that though she might hesitate to annex Eastern Karelia, Eastern  Karelia was eager to beannexed.   But, when the Eastern Karelians met at Repola,  they composed a lougTistof demands to be granted by Finland ;  they were to be given lands, roads, railways ;to be guaranteed food rations such as Finland  herself cannot dream of, and yet theywere  to be free of compulsory military  service for  30 years, and to pay  no taxes  to finland.   If this is the attitude  of Eastern Karelia, it is as  well, the paper says, thatFinland learnt it before it was too late.  She does not want to annex a district whichoffers itself to the  highest  bidder.   Commenting on  this, the Svenska  Daghladet  ofAugust 26th hints that &quot; the grapes are sour,&quot;  and that  the changed  attitude of theFinnish  papers is  due to a recognition  of the fact that  the Finns can  no longercount on the German military expedition.   Even M. Sario has stated, in an interviewwdth  the Tdglische  Rundschau., that events in  Eastern Karelia depend chiefly on theaction of the English troops there.  It would  seem that Germany  is  now no longerholding out hopes of winning Eastern Karelia for  Finland  by military action, - and  isconfining herself to implying her willingness, on conditions (e.g., a German Monarchy),to put pressure on Russia to  offer  Eastern Karelia as  a  gift  to Finland.  Mr. Grovereported on September 11th that the Finnish paper Maakansa recommends droppingany attempt to obtain Karelia forcibly and  coming to  an  amicable  arrangement withRussia.   On September 12th  Mr. Grove  reported   that  the  German  Minister  atHelsingfors had handed the Finnish Government an official  declaration that, in  orderto spare.  Finland and  Sweden  from  being brought  into the war, Germany would undertake to send no troops to Eastern Karelia provided j the Entente would withdrawits troops from Karelia and  Merman and give  a binding declaration that they wouldbe withdrawn by a definite date.  (On September 13th Mr. Grove reported that a railway was being hastily constructed eastwards from Sortavala.)     ddie Foreign Office learns that the Germans now realise  that  the Finnish army is absolutely opposed  to  fighting.  Numerous desertions occur  daily amongst  bothmen and officers.    . Constitution. Mr. Grove reported  on September  .12th that Prince Fiiedrich Karlof Hesse had accepted the Finnish Grown, and that  an extraordinary session of the diet had been summoned for September 26th  to elect  him King.   The Foreign Officelearns that by bribery and other means a  majority vote has  been assured,  and  thatthe election of the Prince is almost inevitable.   Unbiassed Finns hope that he will be only  a figurehead, round Avhom  a coalition Government may rally.  They also believethat, since he would be a guarantee to the  Germans of Finlanchs benevolent neutrality, there is a prospect of the  German  troops being withdrawn,  should  the Finnish Government so request.      Vorwarts observes :- &quot; The time for consideration which the KaiseFs brother-in- law requested was in  any case too short to show him the greatness of his hazard.  If the KaiseFs brother-in-law becomes  King of  Finland,  he will become  King against the wdll of the Finnish people.  The consideration period  Avas, however,  in any case long enough to give  the  Prince an  opportunity of consulting  Avith  author! tatiAre German quarters, without Avhose assent he has certainly not undertaken  this fateful step. Thus the responsibility for   this adventure  falls on the  Government,  ddie latter knoAvs the dangers of prematurely fixing  things in the East, but has proved itself too weak in the  face of currents -which are shortsighted  enough to see- in a quick solution of the throne question an advantage for the Monarchy and dynastic interests. We can only repeat that any lengthening of  the  war for  dynastic objects and any interference in the internal affairs of  a foreign country are as unpopular as can  be. If the Finnish throne for internal or  external reasons proves untenable, the gentleman must come down again.  There is not the slightest inclination amongst the people to stake one drop of German blood for his kingly splendour.&quot;
     Finnish. Relations  with  Great   Britain. A Helsiugfors  Press  message  ofSeptember. 10th  reported  that;.the Consular  shield outside the British Consulatehad  been, found  to have  been, painted over with the German  colours.  The  local.papers of September  11th describe  this defacement as a vulgar outrage and  hopethat  the  unpleasant  incident will  soon be cleared up.   The Ilelsingin Sanomal says:&quot; Such acts shock all International convenances and are impossible in a country whichdesires to be regarded  as neutral.  Such outbreaks endanger the safety  of the -wholeState, so  they  must be  profoundly deprecated.&quot;   Mr.  Grove reported  on the  same date that the Finnish Foreign-Minister had written to express his sincere regret, andhad. added that the  police were  searching for tire culprits, that the Finnish  Govern-rrieht would repaint  and replace  the  shield,  and  that His Majesty&apos;s Consulate would.be protected from further outrages.  There are indications that the Finns.are anxiousto resume relations  with the Allies,   ddre Foreign Office learns that permission &quot;isbeing given to certain  British business men.to return  to Finland from.  Sweden.  the behaviour of the German troops is [operating  as valuable pro-Ally propaganda.  Theyrob right and left and have even stolen candelabra from a  church in Tammerfors.     German  Commercial  Interference and  Penetration. -The  Foreign Office  hasreceived, further information (see also Reports Nos. 84 and 85)  regarding German, inter-ference with Finnish commerce.  Negotiations to supply Denmark with&apos; oil in returnfor Danish products  are being wrecked by the insistence of. Germany  that for everybarrel of oil sent  to Denmark two should  go  to Germany.   The  Finns are becomingvery  bitter  at  this policy of  interference.  A  Press  message   from Stockholm(September 9th) states: &quot; It is reported from Helsingfors that a big company called&apos; Malmundersoehning, Limited,&apos; has been formed there for the purpose of investigating the ore deposits of Finland,  ddre  largest shareholders  are  stated to  be Krupps, ofEssen,  and  the  Finlands &apos; Inclustrikontor.&quot;   A  Press message  from Stockholm(September  9th)  states:-&quot; According to advices  from Helsingfors,  the  Germancinema company &apos; Universum &apos; has bought two cinema theatres there called &apos; Maxim  &apos;and  &apos; Apollo.&apos;  Negotiations are  said to have been  opened  with a  view to thepurchase of further cinemas which are to be used, for German propaganda.&quot;                                    MEXICO.     Attitude of Carranza, Government towards His Majesty&apos;s Legation. Mr. Thurstanpoints out that Carranza has now indicated upon four  occasions that he no longerrecognises His Majesty&apos;s Legation.  The Note  regarding  the  oil. decrees (see ReportNo.  82) was  not  addressed to Mr. Thurstan ;  neither did ho receive notice of theopening  of  Congress.   Carranza  declared  in  his speech to Congress (see Report,No.  84)  that he  did not maintain diplomatic relations with Great  Britain ;  GreatBritain is omitted from  the  latest bi-monthly  list  of diplomatic missions.    TheForeign Office recommends Mr. Thurstan for the present to ignore these slights.     Tampico and  lie  Oilfields. His  Majesty&apos;s  Consul at  Tampico  reported  onSeptember 11th  that  in view oC  the reinforcement  of the Tanrpico  garrison toover 2,000 men, Manuel Pelaez was abandoning his intentions against the town andwithdrawing to Sanjeronimo.  On September 12th he reported that the Governmentwas  sending troops  to the oilfields  preparatory to a strong campaign, and that Pelaezhad  retired to Tierra Amarilla.     Mr.  Barclay   reports  that the  United States  Government has  instructed itsAmbassador in Mexico to present to the Mexican Government a  statement  of recentoutrages at Tampico, and to enquire what steps the Mexican Government proposes totake to put  an  end  to them.  The Foreign Office  instructs  Mr. Thurstan  to make-representations regarding the safety of British subjects at Minatitlan.     The  Oil Decrees. Mr. Barclay  reports that pending full discussion  by all the oil companies, no rents or royalties will be paid by them  under  existing decrees, nor willthey file further manifests.                                NETHERLANDS.     Dutch-Scandinavian Traffic. The Foreign Office points  out to  Sir W. Townleythat  the present  position with regard  to Dutch-Scandinavian traflic  is  by no meansclear.  On the one hand it appears that the Netherlands  Government has  made the     6465-3b                            c
acceptance of a safe-conduct compulsory,, and that the Germans  refuse  such safe-conducts for firms on the German black list;  on the other, the Scandinavian  agree-in en t with the Netherlands Overseas Trust prescribes that all goods carried  to Hollandin Dutch ships must be consigned to the Trust.  It would thus seem, either that thewhole trade is confined to firms which  are on neither  the  British  nor  the Germanblack lists, or that the Netherlands Overseas Trust is  giving facilities  to impropervessels  or firms, or that Scandinavian cargo is being carried to Holland without beingconsigned to  the Trust.     German  Vessels in Dutch East Indies. Regarding the  projected  transfer  to holland of certain  German vessels in  the  Dutch  Hast Indies, the Foreign Officeauthorises Mr. Robertson  to remind the Netherlands Government that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will not recognise such transfer unless  first satisfied as to the conditionsof sale  and employment.  Responsibility for loss or damage to vessels sailing without such approval must rest with the  Netherlands Government.  (See cdso Report No. 84.)                                     PERU.     fixations  with  Chile  in   regard to  the  Tacna  and.  Arica,   Question. AnAdmiralty Report refers to the dispute between  Chile and Peru over the Province ofTacua and  Arica as being  the Alsace-Lorraine  question of  South America and  thematter most likely to disturb the peace of the South American Republics.  The disputedates from the  war of 1.870.  By the Treaty of A neon, Chile, the victor, bound herselfto refer the question, whether  the  Province should belong to Peru,  or Chile to  a plebiscite within  10 years of the signature  of  the Treaty.  Up till, now no suchplebiscite has been. held.   &quot; . .  .  . There is a body of opinion (in  Chile) wddch wouldlike to obtain a settlement  and  so remove an ever present cause of friction betweenChile and Pern, which, if it burst into  flame, would probably  draw  other  elementsinto  the conflagration.   The Chileans realise that if the dispute  were to  be  put to the trial  of the  sword, the quarrel, might not be  limited, to  the disputed possession.of the  Province.   Peru,  if success  attended  her  arms, would not  be likely toforget that  the nitrate fields of Tarapaca once  belonged to her  and were wrestedfrom,  her  in the course  of  the same war.   Bolivia would, probably try  to regain anoutlet on  the  Pacific,  and would  not remain  indifferent  if  she  saw  a chanceof recovering  Antofagasta.  Brazil  or Argentina might also  be tempted  to take  ahand,   decent  circumstances,  on the  other hand., have contributed  to cause alarmin Peru.    Chile  has  imported  munitions  from  Japan ;  while, the  delivery  ofmunitions  contracted  for  by Peru wdth  the house of Schneider was interrupted by the war.  The grant  of  submarines and  the  promise of aeroplanes by the BritishGovernment, in return for the Chilean  warships requisitioned at the beginning of thewar,  have appeared to weight the scales further in Chile&apos;s favour.  Fear of the militarypreponderance  of Chile has clouded the -Peruvian hopes of a favourable solution of thequestion raised by the principles of self-determination and the  protection of  smallnationalities  enunciated by the Allies in  this  war.   .  .   .  The  election  for aPresident  is due in Peru next year.  One of the candidates is the ex-President, SehorLeguia, who stands a good  chance of  election, even  if  all the other  parties shouldcombine against him.   During  his past term as President the relations between Peruand Chile, which had been re-established, Avere again  broken off.  It is  therefore likely that  if Sehor Leguia is  elected his policy will  be more  anti-Chilean than, that of hisimmediate predecessors.&quot;  (And see Reports Nos. 74 and 75 ;  also Nos.  73, 78, 82,and 83  under &quot; Chile.&quot;)                                     SPAIN.    Attitude toxoards German, Submarine Campaign. The Foreign Office learns thatthe Spanish Foreign Minister  remains firm in his intention  that a  G-erman vesselshould be seized in compensation for the torpedoing (if proved)  of the S.S.  Carasa orAtxeri-Mendi) even if such seizure should result in  a rupture of relations or possibly in war.   The  attitude of  the  rest of the Cabinet is  not so certain.

Rumbold topoint  out  that such  a  policy  would be inconsistent  with the  drastic restrictions imposed on British  and  Allied  luxury  trades.  It is  suggested  that the  Swiss-Government might finance such imports, in which  case  His  Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;would be prepared to accord certain facilities in respect  of exchange.0-1-05 3ZJI)-expresses confidence in Maura  and Alhucemas.

Cambo&apos;s party another vote in the  Cabinet.)  There have been rumours  of apossible crisis or of changes in the  Cabinet in  connection with the  coming budget(see Report No. 76).   It is not improbable  that  the King is perturbed  by  the apparent  inevitability of a  decision  favouring one  or other of the belligerent camps.The  Germans  continue  to  spin  out the  discussion  by suggesting  alternativeswhich do  not  affect   the  principle  at  issue.  The French Ambassador  would-appear   to  apprehend  . that  Spain  may make a  rupture  of her  relations  withGermany dependent on French  and British concessions with regard to Tangierand  Gibraltar  (as to  which  see  next  paragraph).   The Foreign  Office has,  in&apos;fact,  received  intimations  from  responsible  Spanish  quarters that the questionsof Morocco  and. Gibraltar are of interest to the Spanish  Government in connectionwith  the matter  now under  consideration,   The  principal  cause  of Spanishhesitation, however,  is fear of the internal  disorders  which, it is believed, wouldresult from a declaration of  war.   It is  widely,  though erroneously,  believed  in spain, that there  are large bodies of American troops in Portugal who would  beemployed in suppressing  such disorders.   The Foreign  Office has informed theSpanish   Ambassador  that  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  considers the  question  of spanish   intervention to be  one  for  Spain  alone  to decide,  though Spain would receive all possible assistance if she should determine to break off relations.     Maurist International Programme. The Daily Review (N.P.S.) of  September loth draws attention to the Accioiis (August 29th)  report  of the  Maurist international programme, setting forth as its first national  aim the security of Spanish frontiers, with regard to which  the following statement is made : &quot; The Straits of Gibraltar do not  constitute  a natural  frontier.   The  integrity of our sovereignty  is  only guaranteed  by  supremacy on  both sides of the Straits.  The  protectorate  accorded to  us in the zone of Northern  Morocco  is  sufficient to secure national interests, provided that tins  zone includes politically,  as it  does  geographically, the city of Tangier and its hinterland, at present internationalised. The zone of  our protectorate ill  Morocco  is not to be considered a Spanish colony, although all economic advantages compatible  with the rights  of the protected  Sovereign should and  must bo drawn from it.  The  policy of military conquest inaugurated in this  zone by virtue of the -Convention of  1912, and only partially rectified since, is a grave error, and for it must be substituted a policy more in accordance with the conception of a protectorate. Spain must exercise on the coast of  Morocco, which is  opposite to the Canary Islands, the same rights as in the northern zone.&quot;  (And see Reports Nos. .62,  64, 74, and 75.)
PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.       (N.B. Countries are. arranged in alphabetical order under tins heading.)     General. The week has been abnormally fruitful in peace talk.  The invitation from the Austro-Hungarian Government to all belligerents to discuss peace  has theappearance of being timed to influence the Allied Labour Conference in London, butthis may be only a coincidence.  Official reports point to the internal situation in Austria.having made it impossible for the Government  to  wait,  in accordance with the alleged German desire, until the tide of Allied advances on the  Western Front  and.elsewhere had slackened.   Meanwhile the telling points against the Austro-hungarian government are :  that troops have been lent to Germany to&apos; help her to hold  on to-territory in Belgium and France, to be used  as  &quot;pawns&quot;  when  a  peace conferencedoes materialise, and that the words of Austro-Huugarian statesmen have in  the past been quite irreconcilable with the policy of the Central Powers, as indicated  by  theirdeeds.  [The most telling example is the enforcement of an indemnity of 300,000,OOOLupon Russia, in addition to the vast deprivations of territory, after the official acceptance by Count Czernin, speaking officially at Brest-Litovsk for the  Central Powers, of theprinciple  of  no  annexations or indemnities.    See Western Reports Hos. 48-49.].German Wireless and Press notices disclaim responsibility for the step taken by the austro-Hungarian  Government.   Tt appears  to be established that the  GermanGovernment was informed of the step before it was  taken, but there is no evidence ofGerman concurrence.  Information, so far received seems to indicate that the  GermanGovernment would have preferred to have the action deferred in the hope that themilitary situation  would  become  less conspicuously  unfavourable  to  the  CentralPowers.     Austria-Hungary, -ddie terms of the Government^ peace note were published inthe Dutch Press on September loth (Mr. Robertson, ddie blague, September 1.5th), andin  The Times  on September 16th.   The fact  of  the  issue  of  the note was  freelyadvertised (German Wireless, September 16tb/17th : Mr. Robertson, The Hague, 15th ;.Sir 11. Rumbold, Berne,  16th).  It seems  from  reliable information (Mr. Robertson,September 17th) that the Anstro-Hungarian Government was anxious to impress uponneutrals that, there was no disposition for independent negotiation, and that germany had been told of the intention to issue the note, and of  its general nature, but not theactual text. It is  reported that German advances  towards the  Belgian Governmentconveyed the impression  in Austria that  Germany wanted to delay a general peaceproposal, for which it was impossible for Austria to wait.   From  the same authoritiesit is clear that the support of  the Swiss  Government   and cf the  Pope was invited.Mr.  BalfouFs reply was published in The Times on September  17th and PresidentWiIsolds on the 18th.     ddie Daily  Review of the Foreign Preys for  September 12th contained interestingreports of proceedings which, in the  light  of  subsequent  events,  were evidentlydesigned to lead up to  the issue of the note by the  Government,   ddrese proceedingsincluded an article by Count Czernin in  the Neue Freie  Presse,  and a speech byCount Burian  to representatives of  the German Press, also  articles in the AustrianPress, in which endeavours  were made to  find common  ground in the recent speeches-of Herr Solf and Lord Robert Cecil.     (See cdso under France, Germany, Sioilzerland.)     Belgium. It is clear, from reliable information which has reached  the  Foreign-Office [154629J, that a definite, though  technically  unofficial,  approach was  made byGermany  to the Belgian Government on August 23rd, conveying  the terms which the-German Government  was  now  willing  to  grant  to   Belgium.   The terms do not,commend  themselves  to the Belgian Government.   Lord  Derby on  September 17th.called attention to an article in the Temps giving details.     Denmark. See under Norway.     France. On September 10th Lord Derby called attention to  an article by MarcelCachin (Socialist Deputy) in Humauil.6, advocating  an international conference in the-hope of thereby helping the German people to revolt against their &quot;odious masters.&quot;     On September  16th Lord Deidy reported, further, that all the principal organs ofthe  French Press  agree in  describing  the Austrian  peace proposals as a  trap...M.  Clemenceahs  reply  to  the  Vienna  Rote   was  published  in  The Times  on.
September 18th, and on the same day Lord  Derby reported that it was calculated to stir deeply the heart of France, as it expresses what every French patriot feels.    Germany. A constant stream of peace talk has  been pouring out of germany during the past few days.   Of the Press articles, the most important is the disclosureby  the  Frankfurter Zeitung  of the  fact  that the  German and  Austro-HungarianGovernments are the real promoters of the proposals for an International LabourConference.  (See The Times of September 13th, page 5.)    Interest  is now centred  on the German attitude towards the Austro-Hungarianpeace note.  Mr. Robertson. (The Hague) forwarded on September  .17th a report thatthe Kaiser and  the  Emperor Charles had agreed at their recent  meeting  that enemy countries should first be approached by neutrals on the peace question.  (N.B. Recentreports from Norway, Switzerland, Spain, and the Vatican lend colour to this rumour- -see cdso last weeks  Western Report and former.)    The material about opinion in  Germany is very Voluminous.  (German  Wirelessof September 12th, 13th, 14th,  loth, 16th,  17th,  and  Daily Review of the ForeignPress 11th, 12th, 14th and 17th.)  The most important is the following extract from german Wireless of the 16th :     &quot; The opinion  expressed  in the German Press regarding the Austro-Hungarianpeace note shows that there is complete accord  in the matter, that  the step has beentaken solely on the  initiative of the Austro-Hungarian Government, and that there is great sympathy for  the measure.&quot;    The Daily  Review (September 17th.) summarises the general, tone of the german press as one of surprise that the Note should have  been sent, and scepticism as to the likelihood of its bearing fruit.    Doth the German Press  and  Wireless  are still full of references&apos; to League ofNations proposals.    German Wireless of September  12th gives prominence  to an.  account  of aconference on  September 10th of  the  &quot; leading representatives of the Workers&apos;Associations of  Germany &quot; at which a Reichstag Deputy announced that  the GermanAssociations  of Workers  had constantly striven  to  come  to an understanding withthe Associations of  Workers in Entente States.    Vice-Chancellor von Payer&apos;s recent speech on peace  terms appears in german wireless of September 13th-14th.   It has  been, reproduced in our Press.    German Wireless of September 16th takes  much interest in the London LabourConference.

SECRET.   APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL,                               REPORT No.  87.                      PART II. FOREIGN AND GENERAL.                               PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.    It has again been necessary this week to embody part of the Appreciation in  the text, which  will  be  found on pages  12  to   15.   The  peace,   advances  by  theCentral Powers can now best be described as a clamour.  They are noted for theirvolume and  variety  rather than  for   any  novelty  in the  arguments  advanced.Constant improvement in the military situation will doubtless cause increased intensity,and  possibly  clearer  definition,  in advances  made  by  enemy countries, eithercollectively or individually.                               GENERAL (page 2).     The coal  situation is still serious. .

There are prospects of an increased coal output from the mines in the Bethune district in the immediate future,  but not from the Lens district.     Italy (page 3). The economic outlook is improving.   The declaration  about the jugo-Slavs deserves attention.                                ENEMY COUNTRIES.     &apos; Germany (page 1). Attention  is drawn to the statement by a pro-German Swede on his conversion to the truth about the origin of the Avar, and  to his opinion upon the attitude of the German population.   Taken in conjunction with official and Press reports lately received, there seems to  be some  basis  for the theory that  the military chiefs are losing their grip over the German nation, and  that the time  foreseen in Appreciation of Reports Nos. 51 and 52 is now approaching.  Reports of  the German-economic position and future policy are of special  interest.
