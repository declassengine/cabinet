SECRET.AVPRE 01ATTON OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT  No.  84.PART II. FOREIGN AND  GENERAL.    The continued success of the Allied arms on the Western front, coupled with the fear of exclusion from the League of Nations and consequent economic ruin, seems tobe producing acute depression in both Germany and Austria-Hungary,   ddie Leagueof Nations is now being represented  as  a  device  of  the  Entente Powers to  crushGermany completely, so  that her  only hope  is  a  military victory.   All internaldissension must be silenced in face  of  the danger which is now threatening.  efforts are also being made to sow  distrust between America and  Great Britain  (PeaceDiscussious, page 13) and between both those Powers and Japan.    ddre Daily Review of the Foreign Press of August 30th contains extracts from avery pessimistic article  by Otto Hoetzsch  (Kreuzzeitung, August 14th).   In it be referred first to -the very unsatisfactory state of affairs in Russia which necessitated the remoA&apos;al of  the German Embassy to Pskov, &quot; that is to say to territory which is inthe military sense not  Russian but German.&quot;  He goes .on to argue  that Englandintends  to exclude  Germany economically not only from Egypt and India, but  also from Persia,  Mesopotamia, Arabia,  Syria,  Palestine, and Africa from the Cape to theNile.     To  achieve her purpose  England  must  be in alliance with  both Japan and america,  ddie greater part of the article  is therefore devoted to an effort  to  excitemutual  distrust between these allies.  &quot;America  feels directly threatened only by japan.  That  is why she naturally sides  with England, since Germany, assuming that the present  hostility did  not exist, could  not  offer  her  any support against japan,&quot; and again: &quot;We can  reckon Avith an Anglo-French community Avhich willlast for a long time yet.  We can reckon less certainly  with the Anglo-Japaneseconnection,-  The  main  point, therefore, is  the significance for  power  relations afterthe Avar of the enormous world-historical fact of the support given to England by heryounger daughter in the Avar.   Can we break or loosen  this alliance ?  The Avar hasimmensely increased the power of the  United States at the expense of England.   It isalso true that America should really be our  ally On  the question of the freedom of these as.  Nor  has America yet, in  principle, recognised the  League of Nations  in the sense  of  Lloyd George.  Though, as  a matter of fact, she is  on that point, too, onEngland&apos;s side.  Both stand together to fight clown the third party, Avhether it be Germany or Bolshevist Russia, or later, perhaps, Japan.&quot;                                        *                           PEACE  DISCUSSIONS (page 13).     Centred Powers. Similar  views to  those expressed by Otto  Hoetzsch  are appearing in  other important papers, and very frequently we  find  the same view of
9&quot;the League of Nations, which now appears in a much less favourable light than it dida short time ago when h wras looked upon, as a means of escape from the effects of  apossible military defeat.     It is possible that this view is being put forward to convince the people that their real, hope lies in continued resistance on the Western Front.     Russia. The treaties supplementary to Brest-Li to v sic were  signed at  Berlin.between  Russia and Germany on August 27th.  They deal with       (1) The  border States, especially Livonia and Esthonia.     (2) Legal relations.     (3) Finance.  Russia to pay 3O0,O00,O0OZ. to Germany.     Switzerland. The general opinion appears to  be unfavourable to intervention atpresent by the Neutral Powers in favour of peace.                               GENERAL (page 2).     (I) The  French Official Journal of August 29th published a Presidential Decreedeclining to  recognise the right of enemy States to issue safe-conducts to neutral ships.     (2)  The  United States have  been invited to  send representatives  to London todiscuss the equitable allocation of tonnage.                                 ALLIED GROUP.     France  (page 3). The Political  Intelligence  Department  of  the Foreign Office-has issued  a memorandum,  which is  summarised in this  Report, explaining the growing divergence of opinion  between the two groups of French Socialists led byMM. Longuet and Varenne respectively.   The latter group was  recently joined byM. Albert Thomas.   The different  views are summed up in the  words &quot; The two sections have not really got their  eyes  fixed  on the  same things.   One (Longuet) isthinking of Socialism, and the class Avar ; the other  (Varenne and Thomas) of  France.&quot;     United States (page 6). An article in the National Zeitung  points  out that asthe result of  her war effort  America will soon  outstrip England  as a world Power.This is obviously part of the German press campaign which aims at exciting jealousyamong the Allied Powers.                                  ENEMY GROUP.     Germany (page 8). (1) The Foreign Office has a report that Count Herdingmay be replaced by Dr.  Solf, although  the  General  Staff would   be opposed to thechange.     (2) A report has been received  that the Polish  Government has declined to acceptthe settlement proposed at the recent Conference at Imperial Headquarters.     (3) Germany relies upon her control of  a large proportion of  the wOrld&apos;s supplyof potash to enable her to break an economic blockade after the war.

There is  some reason .to think that he would like to see a  Finnish Republic established, as this would be  a pretext for a German withdrawal.

PART  II.- FOREIGN  AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.     Sinkings.- According to the War Trade Intelligence- Bureau,  the  total tonnage of 500 tons gross in the case  of  steamers, and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships, reported lost owing  to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies  during the period August 23rd-29th  inclusive,  was 67,716 tons gross,  of  which  43.926  were British, as compared with 63,953 tons gross, of which 23,049 were British, reported last week.     With reference to the German claims, quoted in last  week&apos;s Report, as to tonnage sunk,  the Admiralty points out that,  according to British official,  figures, the July sinkings amounted  to 313,011 tons gross, while the  total  sinkings (British, Allied and Neutral) from the beginning of  the war till the end of July stand at 12,382,254- tons gross.  The  percentage of  error  thus  remains  approximately  the  same about 33 per cent.     Issue of Safe Conducts  by Germany to Neutral  Vessels. The French Official Journal of August 29th published a Presidential Decree to the effect that any neutral&apos; ship  placing herself under the  control  of the enemy by receiving an  enemy  safe conduct  not recognised by the  Allies and  inconsistent  with the exercise  of  Allied belligerent rights, shall be considered, in the  absence  of proof to the  contrary, as navigating in the interests of  an enemy state, and shall, on  that ground, be subject to capture and confiscation.     The  Dutch Ilandelsblad,  in an article fairly representing the Auews  of prominent shipping  firms, points out that  this means  that, in order to sail freely, Dutch ships will have  to ask for safe  conducts from the Allies, and that Germany may consider this srdficient  reason to regard such  ships  as hostile property.  Thus Dutch shipping will find, itself in a vicious circle,   ddie Netherlands Government contends that the German conditions affect tonnage at Dutch disposal rather than  Dutch tonnage at the disposal of the  Allies.   The  Danish  Berllngshe Tidende interprets  the decree as a  claim by. the  Entente Governments  to  control  and  sanction  such   letters  of   safe- conduct, &quot; and  it is evidently intended to prevent the  misuse  thereof,  fldiis is no danger to legitimate Danish shipping,  but rather  stabilises the  situation  and makes our position safer.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s Ministers at the Hague and Copenhagen deprecate any  joint Allied action such as might  tend  to  prejudice  the  present negotiations between  the Associated Powers  and  Holland  and  Denmark  respectively.  (and see Reports Nos. 80, 82j and 83 ;  also No. 79 under &quot;&apos;; United States.&quot;)     Tonnage Distribution. For the purpose of assuring an equitable common policy in regard to the restriction of  imports necessitated by the transport and  maintenance of  American troops, the British,  French and  Italian Ambassadors at Washington have&apos; been instructed to invite  the  United States Government to  send  to  London atdhe earliest opportunity representatives responsible for the allocation of American tonnage/and the limitation  of  American imports,  in order that  final  action may there  be   determined in conjunction  with  the  Ministers  of Gireat Britain, France and Italy.     Coed : German Propaganda. ddie coal situation continues to occupy the attention of  the War Cabinet (and see  Memoranda G.T.  5582,  5589,   and 5597).   german wireless of August 29th quotes  the Luzerner Neueste  Nacliri.cli.ten as contrasting the punctual delivery of German coal to Switzerland with the arrears of the Entente under their agreement  (see Reports Nos. 66-70 and. 72), due to  French, shortage.   TheAftonbladel of August 26th is  also quoted as attributing the continuation of the presentoffensive to the same cause.  &quot; Possibly Foch sees himself in a difficult position  owing-to the submarine  war and is compelled to seek a decision before all industries, apart from
ALLIED  GROUP.                                    BRAZIL.    Effect of  Trade Restrictions. The  Brazilian Ambassador at Washington has intimated that the  Allied  restrictions on.  the  trade  of Brazil are  likely to  affectseriously  her ability to  meet her  foreign obligations.  Mr. Barclay  transmits an enquiry by the State Department as to  the  annual amount so due to Great Britain.In  the Berliner Tageblatt (August  15th  ii.) Captain  Persius, arguing in favour  ofa clean peace says: &quot; We should be unfair to the English if we continued to believethat they were as a nation, obsessed  by the idea that  Germany&apos;s economic downfallwould mean  Britain&apos;s correspondingly increased  prosperity,  Speaking  generally,they quite recognise the fact that the complete collapse of Germany would  mean aneconomic catastrophe for England.   I may give just one example of  wdiat I mean.  Ifwe no longer had  the money to buy Brazilian  coffee, Brazil, would  suffer an annual.loss of Mk. 150 million (calculated on  a pre-war basis).  This sum would  have been used for the purpose of paying interest to England and for  the purchase of Englishgoods.  All  these facts  are  well known in  England, and it  is  therefore  quiteexplicable that, in spite  of tremendous efforts on the part of  certain shortsightedpeople, the idea of a trade war after the present war is over is not  gaining ground.&quot;(And  see Reports Nos. 09, 71, 75, 76, and 79.)                                    CHINA.    Manchuria Station : Trouble between Chinese and Japanese Troops. Sir J. Jordanreports  that in an encounter  between  Chinese and Japanese  troops  at  ManchuriaStation  (see Report No. 83 under &quot;Japan&quot;)  a Japanese officer  and  two  or moreChinese soldiers have been killed.    (And see under &quot; Japan.&quot;)                                    FRANCE.     The French Socialists. A Memorandum (G.T. 5557, dated August 22nd.) by the Political Intelligence Department traces the divergence between  the French Socialist groups led by Longuet and Varenne respectively.  (See Reports Nos. 68, 72, 75,  and 78.) The urgent danger which existed  in  the first week in  June forced all sections, both- of  the General Confederation of  Labour  and of the Socialist Party, to unite in a declaration that controversial questions were to be avoided, no obstacles placed -ill the way of the Government, and everything concentrated on the smgle thought of national defence.   Against  the acceptance  of defeat all were  agreed.   But now that the situation is changed, and the possibility in men&apos;s minds is no longer defeat but victory,those manufacturing guns, have  to cease  from lack of coal.  Possibly France isapproaching the  state of Russia after  the Brussiloff  offensive.&quot;  (And see  ReportNo. 83.)    Anglo-Turkish Prisoners Agreement. The Foreign Office, through the Swiss and netherlands Governments,  is again  endeavouring to procure the execution  by theOttoman Government of the Anglo-Turkish Prisoners Agreement.    Treatment of British Prisoners behind tlie Western  Front. Recent information received  by  the  Foreign  Office confirms the reports  of ill-treatment of  British &apos;prisoners behind the Western front.   (See Imports Nos.  72 and 73.)   The netherlands government has been recpuested to transmit a protest to the German Government.
&quot;the divergence at once reappears, and will probably go on to the end.  In France, asin  England,  pacifism  flourishes  on military success ;  never,  as in Germany,  on military defeat.  Directly we seem to be like winning, the gulf.opens between those-who think first of victory, and those who think first of peace;  or, as  M. Bran ting put it in a speech at Paris, between peace and right, between those who think peace moreimportant  than justice,  and those who think justice more  important than peace ;or,  again, as  an  American  labour  leader  has  put  it,  between  those  who are-for taking  a  short  cut to  a  short peace  and  those  who, being resolved  on  a peace  that  is  based on principles, and  promises  something like  a  permanent settlement of the world, are  prepared to go  on  till  they  get it.....Tim-line taken  by  the American labour  men and,  to   a  less  degree,  by  Branting,about  the  cxuestion of  an  International  Conference, and  later, the plain  words ofEerensky  about  the follies  and  crimes of  the  Bolshevists  and  the  necessity ofAllied intervention, all  irritated  M. Longuet  and his friends,  and  proportionatelygratified the Right Wing of the  party.   Through out  June and July words  and actsindicated the increasing divergence.  On the  one hand there  are  two definite acts ofimportance.   First, M. Albert Thomas decided to join the party  of Socialist Deputiesof the  Right Wing who had formed a new group  under Varenue  ....  The  otherdefinite act on this side of the division was the founding of a new paper La FranceLibre,  to  be  the  organ of the new group.  Its first issue appeared on July  2nd,and announced a programme in  which  it declared  &quot;war  to the knife  against  allpacifist hopes as sheer fraud,&quot; and said its message to  the authorities  was &quot;Conquer,or France wdll never  forgive you.&quot;   So  much for  the acts  and &quot;words  of the RightWing.   Those of the Left were equally  significant  of the growing  division.  their chief,  Longuet,&quot; applauded  the Austrian. Socialists&apos;  reply, attacked  the policy of recognising  Jugo-Slav,  Bohemian, and  Polish  . independence  as  unnecessarilyprolonging the war, and even went so far as to abuse  Kerensky for his share in thebrief Russian offensive of the summer of 1917.   And the tone of the whole group waspredominantly international and  pacifist.  The conflict between  the two sectionsappeared  not  only in  the  Socialist  Party  proper,  but  also  in  the  Workmen&apos;sCongresses.   At that of  the railwaymen, the loyal  or  national  party  defeatedthe pacifists  by  a majority  of  two to  one.  At  that of the  metal workers,  verybitter   speeches  were   made, and  ultimately  a resolution  was  adopted  whichdenounced intervention in  Eussia and called   for  an   early  meeting  of  anInternational  Socialist  Conference.  This  was   practically  a  pacifist   victory.Finally, on July 17th, came the Congress of  the Confederation  Generate du Travail,the first held since the war began. .... The  resolution said nothing about nationaldefence, while it included &quot; no annexations or indemnities,&quot; &quot; no economic war  afterhostilities  cease,&quot;  &quot; no intervention in Russia,&quot; &quot; freedom of the seas,&quot; and a demand,coupled with threats, for passports  for an &quot; International Conference.&quot;   The tone ofthe victorious section  may be seen  by  the fact that M. Merrheim,  its  leader, while-declaring that they must guard against a peace of  Brest, not only criticised  Jouhaux,the leader of the other section  and  Secretary of  the  Confederation, for havingencouraged the entry of  Italy into the war, but attacked  the London InteralliedSocialist Conference as a crime  against  the  International.  .... But these Labourmeetings were only the preliminaries of  the struggle as it developed  at  the SocialistNational Council which met at  the end  of  July.....The motion  of Longuetdeclared for national defence, hut wdth. a great  deal  of abuse of the Governments,which it asserted to have let slip  offers of peace,  insulted the working classes, and pro-duced nothing but  military defeat.  It callecPfor  an  International Congress withoutreserves, and said  nothing  of the  London  Memorandum; demanded the use of &quot;all.means &quot; for the obtaining of passports, even the refusing of credits, to  which it attachedno  conditions. It admitted  of no intervention in Russia without the  unanimous consentof the  Russian Socialists, and vigorously  denounced  the action taken  by Varenne&apos;sgroup in connection wdth the visit and attitude of  the American Labour men.....In  this  way the  split has  begun.    It  is   difficult  to  prophesj^  how it   will develop.   The next stage is the  meeting of the National Congress  of the wholeparty,  in which the ultimate sovereignty, as it were, resides.....  The two sections-have  not  really  got their eyes  fixed  on the  same  things.   One  is  thinking ofSocialism  and the  class  war;  the other of  France. -  The  one  is not  at  heartNationalist at ail; it cares for the  improvement of working-class conditions and for-little  else ;  and it is   bent  on   an International  Conference, largely because  ofthe prodigious advertisement  such a Conference might bring to the  Socialist cause-Peace  is  not in  its eyes the deliverance of  France,  but the necessary preliminary
^      condition to  a  new  social and economic order.&quot;  ddie other  section holds  that an      even more necessary condition is  the  defeat  of German militarism,  and  that no      half-defeat will do.  The one is  a  prisoner of the Marxist tradition, which sees all      questions through economic spectacles,  ddie  other,  while  insisting  on  industrial)      and economic changes, realises that  a nation is something more than a mere economic      unit, that freedom is a value that cannot be expressed in wages, and  that the soul      .and body of France, to the making of which ten or  twelve  centuries have been given      were made to play a part in the world which no class but only a nation  can play, and      that it would  be treachery to the past and future of the world, as well as of France, to      sink her identity&apos; in any International.....   In  the issue of the Iiumanite  for      August 21st Thomas has an article insisting that  the refusal of war credits ought not      to be  made either an answer  to the refusal of  passports or a weapon of political      opposition.  He will  vote the credits, even if he has to oppose M. Clemenceau.  In      the same issue Presseniane declares  that  it would be  a  &quot;hypocrisy &quot; for him and his      political friends to remain tied up  a day longer with  ddiomas and Varenne.  ddie      attitude which they have adopted  is  one  with which he and  those who think with him      cannot possibly come to terms or accept  any compromise.          German  Wireless of August 30th  applauds  the  French pacifists and quotes      Vonvdrts of August 28th as asking whether Poincare and  clemenceau have really      obtained such  successes  as justif3r a war to  the bitter end. Marshal Foch&apos;s Des      Principes de la Guerre are also cited as impliedly criticising, in reference to the Boer      War,  the capitalistic  motives  ol:  the  English.    (See also  Report No.  83  under      &quot; United States.&quot;)                                       GUATEMALA.          German  Properties.-- Mr.  Young reports that  on August 20th  the President of      the Guatemalan Republic informed  the United  States Minister, in reply to represen-      tations by the latter, that, though anxious to adopt the  same attitude as the United      States in regard to liquidation of German properties, he did not see how he could do      so, since the major portion of the productivity of  the State belonged  to  Germans,  and      there was nobody wdio  could purchase  their interests.   ddie President welcomed a      suggestion made  by  the United&apos;  States  Minister that an official  of  standing  and      authority should  be  sent by  the  United States Government to discuss  a  solution.      Mr. Young suggests  that the result  of such a visit is likely to be either a modification      of the  Black List policy  or an altered relationship between the United States  and      Guatemala.                                          ITALY.           Projected release of German-owned  Cotton  for Swiss Consumption. -ddie Foreign      Office learns  that an agreement is contemplated under  which 15,000 bales of  cotton,      believed  to  be German-owned,  would be released  from Italy for consumption in      Switzerland.   Representations are being made to  the Italian Government as to the      undesirability of such release  unless  and until it  has  been clearly ascertained  that      enemy interests will neither directly nor indirectly  benefit.           Sicilian Oranges. Mr. Erskine  reports that it  is of considerable political and      economic importance, this year no  less  than last, that the Sicilian orange crop should      be taken up  by England.           Tripoli. The Foreign Office learns that Said Ahmed, Sheikh of the Senussi, has      left Tripoli in  an enemy submarine.  A Press  telegram reports his arrival from Pola      at Vienna en route to Constantinople.                                           JAPAN.           Position of Government. Sir C. Greene reports that the position of the Japanese       Government  is  regarded as very insecure.  The Kenseikai   Party  is  opposed  to       operations on a large scale in Siberia.            German  Propaganda. German  Wireless  of  August  30th and  31st  and       September 3rd dilates  upon Anglo-Saxon plans  against Japan.   The ICreuzseitung            6465-If).    .                           B
and  Koelriisclie  Zeitung are quoted  as exposing  a  secret  treaty between  GreatBritain and America,  under which  they  are to  &quot; direct  themselves first againstGermany and for the  duration  of  the war  to  treat Japan  as  an ally  in  order  tobe  able  to  exploit  her   assistance.  After  the  termination  of  the  fighting thetwo  wdll  then  direct themselves  against  Japan  and.  render  her  harmless.&quot;Japan  is stated to be  aiming at an  &quot; Asia for the Asiatics &quot; under Japanese leader-ship, and  at  penetration of China  for the  realisation  of  an  economic  autocracyand  maritime supremacy in the Pacific  Ocean.   &quot; Japanese  expansion also  aifectsAmerica in the Philippines and Hawaii,  and England in India. ... It is well known that  ever since Japan became a great Power India has  directed her eyes towards her,and  that every progress of Japanese Imperialism  causes movements in India whichrun parallel with the Japanese Monroe Doctrine.  The recent Anglo-Indian Conferencein Delhi and Madras throws a flash of light on coming events, and illustrates the firstattempts of the British defence.  England will have to  defend India and China.  Itappears, therefore, to be out of the question  that England will ever give her  agree-ment to  paying Japan with French  farther India as  the price of Japaibs military intervention against  Germany.   For  this  reason, English and American policy&apos; mustendeavour to isolate Japan and to throw back her expansion in China to  its  initial stages.  In doing this these countries wish  to procure  for themselves  a  rearguardprotection by rendering Germany incapable of interfering in world politics.   It was&apos;to their interests, however, to postpone a possible open  conflict between China and japan  until it was possible  for them to intervene in the role of arbitrators with asuperiority of political power.  This is the reason why, for the time being, they wishedto avoid any disturbing combination,  and are  attempting  to tie  clown Japan&apos;s  policy to the  road by way of Vladivostock into Siberia.&quot;                       UNITED  STATES  OF  AMERICA.     Man-Power Bill. On August 30th Congress passed the Man-Power Bill  extending the draft age limits to 18 and 45  years.     War  Organisation. Mr. John D.  Ryan has  been appointed  Second assistant secretary of War in  place of Mr. Stettinius, who wdll continue as Special Representativeof the War  Department in France.  Mr. Ryan is  designated as Director of Airshipservice,  in which  capacitj^ he  also controls the Bureau  of  Aircraft production.Mr.  Crowed, First Assistant Secretary of War, is  made responsible &quot;for the programme of Munitions of War.  There  is reason to  believe that these  changes have  beenhastened by the publication of the report  of  the Senatorial Committee upon aircraft production.     German Propaganda regarding American Aims. German Wireless of August 30thand  September  1st  enlarges on American ambitions to dominate Europe in generaland  England  in. particular,  ddie Berliner Loludanzeiger of August 29th is quoted toshow,  in.connection  with American intervention in. Russia, that &quot; the peoples who arethoughtful for  their  future have to  combat a  dictatorship of  a  vast capitalistickind.&quot;  ddie  statement is made that, in the absence of British  shipping, America isstarving Australia of imports.   &quot;A leading English trade paper &quot; is cited as sayingthat the new American mercantile marine  is  designed to capture British  world-trade.    &quot; What is  the object  of  wdnning  the war  if English  trade has  to pay for  it, and if America gets that trade ? &quot;   An article in  the National Zeitung ofAugust  27th, by Colonel  Herwarth-Land,  formerly  German  Military  Attache  atWashington,  points out  that  &quot; the  United  States,  by her  preparations on  sea and land,  as well  as  by her  huge  war profits, has  strengthened herself to-day to  such a world-power that   she  is  about to   surpass  England, and, added  tothis,  England  owes  America far  over  20  milliards.    The  desire  for  America&apos;sentry  into the war was the greatest error of  calculation, of  the British.&quot;  reference is also  made to the  Extrabladct  of  August 29th,  which, under the heading  of &quot; fldie  Ruin of  Europe,&quot; explains that, if  the Allies  persist in  a fifth  year of war,&quot;the Americanisation of broken-down  Europe can then seriously commence.   even now America is the  leader.  The Allies are clay by day becoming  more dependent ontheir great Ally.  The war can  only be carried  on with  the  soldiers of America andwith American money, and  America can decide whether Europe shall starve or  shalleat.   The control of  the financial market of the  world,  is moving  from. London to new York, and after the   conclusion of  peace the New York Stock Exchange will
dominate the  London  Stock Exchange.  In addition to this, America, which beforethe war had only a small mercantile marine,- has  now commenced upon the greatestshipbuilding  programme which  the world has ever seen, and this is  taking  placeprecisely at the time when the English mercantile marine, which hitherto  had beenthe  first  in  the world, is  being  appreciably diminished  by submarine  warfare.&quot;This  article   makes  a  somewhat  inconsistent excursion  into American, domesticpolitics: &quot; November 4-th is  a critical clay for the Entente.  Then will be decidedwho is to be the leader of the American Congress which  meets on March 4th whether he will be a Democrat or a Republican.....The Republicans are tired of AA7ilson&apos;sgame, and the Socialists in the United States  are  on the- increase.&quot;   (See also under&apos;&quot; General &quot; and  &quot; Japan.&quot;)ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    Austrian Debt to Holland. The  Foreign Office  learns that it will be  necessaryfor Austria in the middle of September to redeem credits in Holland to the amount of5,000,000 florins, which, at the present rate of exchange, represents 25,000,000 kronen.It  is stated that Austria is unable to do this, and that she will therefore have to renew,and  in order to obtain  such  renewal will  make*very large concessions.  (Accordingto  a report received, the banknote circulation in Austria, which shortly before the war was 2-1 milliard kronen, has now risen, to 22-1- milliards.  No statement is published asto  the gold reserve, and it is supposed that this has been transferred to  Germany.)&apos;    Recognition of Czecho-Slovaks by the United States. Mr. Barclay reports that theUnited States Government has recognised the Czecho-Slovaks as an independent andbelligerent nation.   (See also next paragraph.)     Ju go -Slav ism. Discussing  the recent pronouncement by Eis Majesty&apos;s Govern-in ent in favour of the Czecho-Slovaks, the Foreign Office has explained to the SerbianMinister that the Czecho-Slovaks have a large army in the field, and a National Council,which is recognised and obeyed by all the Czech forces ; whereas in the case of the jugo-Slavs no such conditions at present exist.  The Foreign  Office has pointed  out&apos;that the question, of recognition is one of  nationality, collateral,  to that of territorialaccommodations between Italians and. Slavs :  attacks  by  outsiders upon  Baron Sonninoare to be deprecated.  It  has been  arranged that the Serbian  Minister shall furnish,for discussion,  some definite formula  in regard to the Jugo-Slavs.     An  important  Slav  Congress  has been held  at  Laibach,  at which  Croat,Serbian,  Czech and   Polish representatives  were  present.    The   Congress  waspromoted  by the -Prince  Bishop  of Laibach.   It  resulted  in the  establishmentof a  Slovene National Council,, which is to  be  the first branch of  a future SouthSlav National  Council, corresponding  to  the Czech  National  Council  at Prague.Several  well-known  South  Slav  politicians have  recently  been  released fromprison at  the   orders  of  the Emperor Charles.  According  to a  report received,a  strike  recently  took place  in  the quicksilver  mines  at  Idria  in   Carniola,the  miners  being  unable  to   carry  on  wdth  the  food provided.   The  striketook  the form of a demand that  those  officials  of the mines who were Austro-Germans  should   be  dismissed   and replaced  by Slovenes.   The  Reichspost ofAugust  14th contains the following Austrian criticism of &quot;The Jugo-Slav dream&quot; :  &quot;  Jugo-Slavism aims at the establishment oP a  State consisting-of Croats,  Serbs  andSlovenes.   The project  encounters  strong   opposition  from . Serbs  and  Croats.Even those  who describe themselves  as  -Jugo-Shxys are intent either on a  SouthSlav  State  under  the  rule  of:  the Serbs,  i.e.,  a Greater  Serbia;  or  on a  SouthSlav State under the Croats, i.e., of a Greater  Croatia.  But  what is  to be the fate ofthe  Slovenes?  Hitherto the vast majority of the  Slovene  people have  been  good- Catholics.  Until  the  outbreak of the war the  leadership of the  rank  and file ofthe  people in Carniola,  Styria  and  the coastlands was  controlled  by the SloveneYolkspartei a party in- entire  agreement  with the Catholic outlook on things in.,general.   Yet  even  before the war  influences were at work which threatened a partial
s&quot;breaking  away from the  successful,  practical policy of the Volkspartei, in order  to pursue an idealistic  policy which subordinated everything to  the  idea of nationality.This tended to obliterate the hitherto distinct line between&apos; Slovene Liberalism andSlovene Catholicism.  The Slovene National Liberals  established friendly  relations-with  those  who  aspired to a  Greater Serbia-whereas the Volkspartei, as a whole,.remained/true to Austria  and her dynasty,  and well  disposed towards the Croats,who  were not merely akin  to  the   Slovenes in race,  but deeply  attached to the-same form  of religious belief.  Prior to the war no  politicians would ever havecounted on  an  understanding between the  Catholic  Slovenes  and  the  OrthodoxSerbs.  Jugo-Slavism arrogates to itself a position of superiority to all these facts and-their implied consequences.   Race  consciousness is  looked upon as  the  discardedfashion of a bygone age.   Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes are to disappear, to be resolved into the higher conception of Jugo-Slavism.  Many Jugo-Slavs perceive a means  to this end in religious uniformity.  The Serbs cherish the hope that the Catholic Croats- and Slovenes will embrace the Orthodox faith, and for this  very reason are  distrusted in Crbation circles.  Whilst the followers  of Korosec dream of winning over the Orthodox Serbs to the Church of Rome !   Neither of  these solutions is in  the least- degree probable,   ddie realisation of the South  Slav programme  involves a clean sweep  of all hitherto existing arrangements, not only in Austria and the Monarchy, but also in the Serbian  States beyond  the frontiers  of  the Monarchy.    Thus it abandons the domain of internal policy and involves itself in questions of foreign and international policy.  From  this it is but a step  to  the  demand that the destiny of Jugo-Slavia shall  be decided  at  a  possible future  peace conference.   But even if the  South Slav programme  were  limited to action within  the Monarchy, it would imply  the Avrecking of the dual system, and  of the  ancient Crownlaiid  organisa- tion  of  Austria.   The  Czechs  are at  least able  to point back to a  Bohemian kingdom, which  existed  centuries.ago.  But history  has nothing to say about any Slovenia  or  Jugo-Slavia.   Geographical, economical  and  commercial  conditions have established between the Slovene territories  and the adjacent Alpine-German regions the  relationship  of the  Siamese  Twins.   There  can  be  no  severance save by death or injury to the vital  organs,   ddie Croatian-Serbian  complexus could never afford the Slovenes any compensation  for the loss of  this historic community of. life.   Tested by the  educational standard, the Slovenes rank  fourth amongst the peoples  of  Austria.  They  cannot but draw unfavourable comparisons  between themselves  and  the dwindling population   of the surrounding  regions where  the- poverty of the land and the backwardness of trade and industry had led to  excessive emigration in the years  before the  war.  There is nothing to justify  the glowing pictures of a flourishing kingdom and a. powerful future State, which are the subjects of Jugo-Slav oratory.   Is it possible  that for  the sake of these baseless visions all the foundations  of the Monarchy are to be destroyed, and the ancient  cultural relationship to the  Germans changed into seething hatred?  Accursed  are  the leaders who are- deceiving the simple peasantry of  Carniola and  the coastkmds and. the Slovene- proprietors  of Lower Styria and Carinthia.   Austria must see to it that these blind guides do  not  drag their people  down to  an abyss  of  certain misery.&quot;   (And  see Reports from No. 54 onwards under  &quot; Austria-Hungary &quot; or &quot;Italy.&quot;;                                    GERMANY.      The Chancellorship. According to  a report received by the Foreign Office  the- rumour that Count Hertling is to  he replaced byDr. Solf is  likely-to  prove correct, although the  General Staff is strongly opposed  to  the change.  Dr. Solf would be- likely to  make a strong peace  offensive oh plausible lines.      Mitkel-Buropa. According to a  report received by the Foreign Office, the German delegates at Salzburg pressed the  Austrians to  agree that Austria-Hungary should enter into a Customs union with Germany,   ddie Austrians flatty refused, stating that their instructions limited them to  offering Germany preferential rates.   This reply- made the Germans very augry.  (And see Reports Nos. 58, 06, 68, 82 and 83.)      Germany and  Russia. The Foreign   Office  is  informed that  the German. Government was  strongly  advised   by llelfferieh, on his  return  from  Russia,  to- abandon the Bolshevists  and support  certain Monarchist elements in that country.. (But see also under &quot;Peace Discussions.&quot;)
    Polish Question.-The Foreign Office is informed  that  the  Polish Government isnot prepared to come to an agreement with Germany on the basis of the conditions laid clown at the recent Spa conference.    Independent  Action by German  States. The Vossische Zeitung expresses alarmat the project attributed to the Bavarian and Saxon,Governments of having their owndiplomatic representative at Sofia.   It  denounces it as another  evil manifestation  ofthe mediaeval particularist spirit, which is incompatible with the Imperial idea, and.takes occasion to  rap the Federal States on the knuckles for their dynastic rivalries inborder States, and for the way in which they  have been trying to get represented inall sorts of negotiations,  which, in virtue  of their international  character,  requiresolely an Imperial representative.  &quot;Bavaria  and Saxony are already  represented byplenipotentaries  in the economic negotiations  with  Austria-Hungary  at Salzburg.Wurtemberg has  now also appointed its plenipotentiary, and we must protest  againsta  policy which, may  eventually lead  to  every  single Federal State appointing itsplenipotentiary.&quot;   According  to  a telegram from Munich to the Vossische, the king of Bavaria intends shortly to visit Bulgaria accompanied by his Premier, Dr. von Dandl.The Emperor Charles, accompanied by Baron  Burian, has recently visited Dresdenand Munich.     Potash,  as an Economic  Weapon. The Daily  Review (R.S. of  July  30th  at . 133 and Z^.S. of A ugust 27th at p. 169) reports articles by Professor Roth of Greifswaldon the  economic importance  of  potash.  It is  upon  potash, together wdth coal andiron, that Germany pins her hopes of successfully breaking through the blockade whichis to culminate in completely shutting her off from the supplies of raw materials. .  .  .The only serious  rivals to German potash  salts  are those  of Catalonia ; but  Germanreserves are so much greater than the Spanish that Germany is given  ample breathing space.  It is unlikely that the  hostile countries will boycott German  potash, as thatwould mean  a  return to non-intensive  farming  and consequently prolonging  an unsatisfactory situation, which the  countries weakened by the war could not  endurepermanently. For in the next few years  the  shortage  of cargo space will  compelEurope to  rely for  the most part on her own agricultural produce.   The import of mineral fertilisers occupies less cargo  space than that of  grain and cattle.  Americawill be obliged to attempt to  produce that  highly valuable  export commodity cottonin as large a quantity as before the war ;  but in that  case  large quantities of potashare indispensable.  While there  may not be a very large  export of potash to hostilecountries immediately after the cessation of  hostilities, there wdll  be certainly later ;neutral countries, however, wdll import large quantities at once.     A  report received emphasizes the significance in this connection  of a  possiblerupture between  Spain and Germany.     Post-war Shipping. Der  Welthandel of August  9th reports that  a movementhas been set on foot in Hamburg and Bremen shipping circles  to  send after-the-warorders to Dutch  yards for the  construction of German merchantmen,  and  for thisobject to supply the yards wdth a corresponding quantity  of  shipbuilding material.A. report received states that Danish yards are already accepting  such  orders.  TheDeutsche  Tageszeitung of duly  19th  mentions a  scheme  to  make Eckenforde  atranshipment port,  and to run a canal thence to  join the Kiel Canal,  using the inter-vening  Wittensee as  a subsidiary harbour.   The idea is to enable liners conveyinggoods for the Baltic from across the Atlantic and North Sea to proceed through theKiel Canal and this new route to Eckenforde, where they would tranship their goods to small Baltic steamers, and in exchange receive goods for shipment  back across the atlantic.   In this trade the projected port is calculated to supplant Copenhagen..6465-16o
NEUTRAL GROUP.                                    CHILE.    Damage  to German  Ships. Sir F.

Probable German  Peace Offensive. Poliliken   of  August  28th  publishes  an-article by a pro-German named Carl Thalbitzen, renewing the suggestion  that  three-parliamentary representatives from each of the belligerent countries should be invitedto meet at the Scandinavian Inter-parliamentary Convention,  in September, to discussthe possibility of peace by understanding.  This would seem to foreshadow a German peace  offensive in Denmark.   (And see Report  No. 82  under  &quot; Peace Discussions-(Central Powers) &quot;).                                  FINLAND.    Finland and the North. ddre Foreign  Office learns that the continued applica-tions  of General  von der  Goltz  for  reinforcements  have brought  him  into  dis-favour  at German Headquarters.   There  is some reason  to  believe that  he wouldlike to see a Republic established in Finland, as this would  afford a plausible  pretext for  a  German withdrawal.  As  for the Finns,  soldiers, officers,  and  the Minister ofWar himself, are opposed to  participation  in  the  war.  According  to  the SwedishPress  (and German Wireless) of August 30th-, the Finnish-Russian peace negotiations have not been definitely broken off  but  only temporarily interrupted,   ddie Finnish.News  Agency announces that on August 25th  a large  hydroplane (assumed  by theSwedish. Press  to  have  been  English  or Allied) dropped  bombs over  Kurtti, avillage  east of Kuolajarvi in North-East Finland, and  also fired two machine-guns.German Wireless (August 25th) states that two persons were injured  and (August30th) that the  Finnish Government has protested to the Entente Powers.  (See  cdso-under &quot;Peace  Discussions.&quot;)    German Commercial Interference. -The Foreign Office  learns that  the germans are blocking all  commerce between Finland and other  countries. To take a  single-example, the Ukraine had ordered a large supply of paper from Finland, in exchange forwhich they were to give sugar.  The Germans would only permit  this on the  condition that equal amounts of paper and. sugar were sent to Germany at their own  prices.Feeling is  reported to  be growing daily  more  bitter in Helsingfors against  the-Germans.    Constitution. According to a Berlin telegram, August 28th, Duke Adolf Friedrich.of Mecklenburg-Schwerin declares that his name has been erroneously mentioned inconnection  with the  candidature to  the  Finnish Throne,  ddie telegram  adds that although he urns originally approached from Finnish  quarters, the Duke is entiretyopposed to any such plan,  and that, should he eventually be chosen,  lie would not bein a position to accept.  (And see &quot; Appreciation.&quot;)    Suggested Union with Esthonia. The  Esthonian Bureau  in  Stockholm reported&quot;on August 29th as follows : &quot; ddre White Government of Finland has made a proposalto that part of the  (formed) Esthcnian  Landtag which  is not imprisoned or has notbeen  carried out of the country by  the occupying German Authorities that a union.should be made between Esthonia and Finland.   The proposal has been refused.&quot;
                                  HONDURAS.     Boundary Dispute with Nicaragua. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Managua reported-on August 29th that Honduras troops had crossed the frontier.  No measures to  repelinvasion had been taken by the Nicaraguan Government, which  apparently relied onmediation  by the United States Government.   According to His Majesty&apos;s Consul atTegucigalpa negotiations were  being arranged,  pending which the disputed territorywas  to be declared a neutral zone ;  the Honduras  troops had not yet, however, been withdrawn.     According  to  a Press message,  the controversy is   said  to be  due  to  the discovery of gold along one of the border rivers.   (And see Reports Nos.  82 and 83.)                                    MEXICO.    Speech  by Carranza on  Foreign  Affairs. At  the opening  of  Congress  onSeptember  1st,  President Carranza  delivered a  speech on  Foreign  Affairs.   Hedeclared that Mexico was neutral, but that certain difficult  points  had arisen.   Heinstanced (A) the Black Lists, (2) various violations of  Mexican  neutrality by &quot; Anglo-American &quot;  warships and aircraft,  (3)  interference by belligerents with diplomatic andother correspondence, (4) enlistment of Mexican citizens  in  the United States Army.According to the principles of Mexico&apos;s  international  iDolicj&apos;&apos;,  all countries wrere  ecpualand none might interfere in anotheFs  domestic affairs ; nor might any foreigner in any country enjoy a more privileged position than its nationals.   The application of these principles resulted  in (1) the withdrawal  of the Mexican representative from  Cuba(see Reports Nos. 70-72) and (2) the issue of the Petroleum Decree of February 19th(see Reports Nos.  58, 81, and 82).   Afexico was  at  peace  with all the world;  shemaintained  diplomatic   relations -with all countries,  and  had received proofs  of friendship even from such distant  nations  as Japan.  Replies to the Presidentsnotification  of his assumption of office had been received from the Argentine, Austria-Hungary, Belgium,  Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Denmark, Germany,  Guatemala,  Honduras,Japan,  the  Netherlands, Norway,  Peru, San  Salvador, Spain,  Sweden,  Turkey,  theUnited States and  Uruguay.  Relations  with San Salvador were  very  friendly, andMexico had presented to that State  an aeroplane and a wireless  apparatus.   TheBritish Government  had declined to receive Mr. Siller as Mexican Minister withoutguarantees from Mexico  of neutrality and protection of British  subjects ; the mexican government had observed neutrality and endeavoured to give guarantees to foreignersand  neutrals ;  it  had therefore  not   insisted on appointing  a  Minister  as  (in  the presidents opinion)  it was better  for  the tranquillity and dignity of Mexico that  she should only maintain diplomatic relations with  such  nations as  showed her  respect and treated,  her with the equality to which she was entitled.   As to whether Mr. Nietoshould  be accredited to France, no reply had  yet been received from the FrenchGovernment.     Mr. Thurstan considers that the whole tone of the speech was decidedly truculent.     Border Skirmish. Mr. Barclay reports that on the  night of August 27th  shotswere exchanged in  Nogales, resulting in  the death  of two or three Americans  andtwenty Mexicans.   The  United States Consulate was hit several times and a clerk  waswounded.  According to the State Department the first shot was -fired by a MexicanCustoms official  at an  American sentry.   A  local  settlement  is  expected.   OnAugust 31st the matter was stated to be well in hand.     Situation in Oilfields. His Majesty&apos;s Consul atTampico reported on August 29tha rumour that Pelaez had been joined by  General Alvarez, the Carranzist commander in the oilfields, and his forces, consisting of about 400 men.  Pelaez was also said tohave received lately a considerable consignment  of  arms  and ammunition.   It isstated that  he wdll presently begin an active campaign.   Mr. Thurstan considers  that,if this is true, Pelaez  may very possibly take Tuxpam and Tampico in the  nearfuture.     Oil Taxation. Mr. Thurstan reports that, as authorised, he has (on August 20th)entered a further protest against the oil decree.  Export taxes are payable before themiddle of September.   Mr. Barclay reports that the action  of  the Eagle Company in
filing manifests has caused considerable disappointment and distrust among the other companies.  Mr. Thurstan submits that tbe attitude of the Eagle Company lias beenhonest and  consistent,   ddie Foreign  Office authorises Mr.  Barclay  to make it clearthat the  Company  acted as it did  because it could obtain  no assurance of support from the United States Government.                               NETHERLANDS.     Reported Construction  of Cabinet. Sir W. Townley reports  that there is goodground for&apos; believing  that  a Cabinet  of  the  Right  has  almost been constructed,consisting of M. Buys  van  Baerenbrouck as President  of the Council and Minister ofthe Interior, M. van Karnebeek (present Mayor of The Hague)  as Foreign Minister,M. van Idenburg as Minister of Colonies, and M. Heemskirk as Minister of Justice.Tiie Ministry  of Finance has been offered to  M.  Trip,  wdio may, however,  declineCabinet rank,   ddie prospective administration contains a strong  Roman  Catholicelement, including the President himself.  The German Minister is stated to regard the President as likely  to be anti-German in his policy.     East, Indies Convoy. The Foreign Office instructs  Sir W. Townley to make clear to the Netherlands  Foreign  Minister in writing  that  the  conditional waiver by HisMajesty&apos;s Government  of the right of search in the case of the East Indies Convoy(see Reports Nos. 70-76) applied only to the outward journey, and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment intends to exercise its  full right of search  if any further attempt shouldbe made to transport passengers and  goods  under convoy.

Altitude towards  Germany regarding the Submarine  Campaign.-Th.e ForeignOffice learns that on August 29th news was received /by the Vascongada Company ofthe torpedoing of their Spanish S.S. Garasa with the loss of six lives,   ddie ship had left  Bilbao  on  August  19th  for  Cardiff.  The Spanish  Government is  awaitingdetails from the Spanish  Consul  at  Cardiff.   A  communique in the Spanish Press ofAugust 31st announced  the occurrence,  and stated that  on receipt of  the report,the Go\rermiient would take the necessary decision.  The Foreign Minister  intends, ifprevious reports  are confirmed, that a German ship  shall at once be seized.  he believes himself to be supported in this intention by the whole Ministry ; failing such support he will resign.  At the conclusion of a Council of Ministers held  on August31st, the  Press was semi-officially informed, that a  second Spanish ship,  the Atxeri-Mendi, had been torpedoed and that  a report  had been telegraphed for, with a viewto the execution of  the decision taken  on August 15th.   (There is reason to believethat this  second case is seriously  regarded  by the  entire Council.)  It  was alsoannounced that  in  order to prevent the neutrality of  Spain being compromised byarticles in. the Press  it  had  been decided to  suspend  temporarily  the  guaranteecontained in section 1 of Article 13 of the Constitution, but  it was  hoped that itwould not prove  necessary to apply this measure.

Centred Powers. All, or almost all, peace discussion  now centres round the ideaof the League of Nations.  In some quarters the  intention ascribed to the entente powers of using it as a&apos; means of accomplishing  the  economic ruin of Germany isadvanced as the  strongest argument  of  fighting  on to the  end.&quot;  There  is littleattempt to conceal the seriousness of the present military situation, and the need forresolution on the home front is acknowledged in the telegrams  which passed betweenvon  Iiindenburg and von  Hertling on  the Imperial chancellors  birthday.  Vonliindenburg  telegraphed: &quot;The most recent  announcements of enemy statesmendemonstrate  their naked  will for  destruction, and bring  to each one of  us  theknowledge of the fate which Germany can expect if she does not victoriously withstandthis  struggle.  I am  firmly convinced that the homeland stands in national  deter-mination behind the fighting troops  in order to bring about, the certain defeat of. thewantonness  of our enemies.&quot;  In reply the Chancellor said : &quot; Your Excellency andGeneral Ludendorff have turned more serious situations during  the war into situationsfavourable to  the  Fatherland.  It  further knows that only a closed  front in  thehomeland can give to the arm;- that strength and willingness  for sacrifice which isnecessary to it in the hot struggle.&quot;     In the Berliner  Tageblatt of August  23rd  the intention is ascribed to PresidentWilson of forming a League of Nations among  the  belligerent and neutral Powerswhile the war is  still in  progress.   &quot; In WilsoiPs claim that the  interests of european allies,  which are at bottom thoroughly individual, and by no means parallel, are  to  be subordinated to an ideal of world peace, there is expressed  a  consciousness  of power which must  make a serious impression on  England.   It is precisely England whichhas,  so far, carried on the war on the explicit principle that the  salvation of the worlddepends upon the good of England.&quot;   This policy  is contrasted with Lord  Gurzon&apos;sspeech in the House of Lords,  in which he set forth the  difficulties which would arise if Germany&apos;  were excluded from the  League, &quot;in that case we are  condemned to reproduce exactly the condition of conflict now existing, or to perpetuate it, since weshall then have two leagues a friendly league of the Allies, and the league of  theenemy nations which will  divide Europe into  two opposing camps.  This may, for atime, be unavoidable,  but  it cannot work for peace.&quot;     Clearly the object of the article is  to show that President Wilson&apos;s  policy is  not altogether friendly to Great Britain.     The same idea of the League appears in the speech by Dr.  Stresemann, Presidentof the National  Liberal Party in the  dleichstag, vdiich vras quoted at  considerablelength in the German Wireless of September 2nd :       &quot;  How a League of  Nations  is to be made compatible with the economic boycott of a large portion  of the world is  a question  which all the  smooth talk of enemystatesmen wdll not be able to solve.&quot;     6-105-16                            n
     &quot; Germany,&quot; lie says, &quot;is prepared, at all times to listen to sincere conversations asto an honourable peace, but for any further German pffef the world will wait in vain. ...She, wdth her allies,  will look  in firm confidence to her  economic strength and forceand  can look forward t,Q her military invincibility wdth complete confidence.&quot;     On the same elate the German Wireless gave a long extract from the) NorddeutscheAllgemeine Zeitung, which declares that England demands of Germany &quot; the renunciation-tion of our colonial  policy and  the law of  the sea, that  is  to say,  industrial andpolitical dependence ; France  demands the  reconquest  of Alsace-Lorraine, and theimportant raw materials on the left bank  of the Rhine.  .  . .  The  Slav saying &apos; fromDanzig to Trieste,&apos;which&quot;this  clay once again  brings to the fore,  even  though in agrotesque form, still has the same force in the East.&quot;  ....  This ideal would thereforeconsist in the happiness of the world J3eing built up  on the held try of  one of the greatpeoples of the world.     &quot;  There are only two ways to this&apos; end,&quot; the Norddeutsche points out in conclusion,&quot; a victory of Germany  or the  self-determination of Europe.&quot;     United Stales. While  the German people is  thus  exhorted to  stand firm, thePresident of the United States in his Proclamation authorising the  registration of all men between the ages of 18  and  45  has said, &quot;We solemnly purpose to achieve a decisive victory of arms and  deliberately to  devote the larger part  of  the militaryman-power of the nation to the accomplishment  of that purpose.&quot;     So far,  therefore, as the United States and Germany are concerned, there would.appear to be but, little  room for any form of peace by negotiation, so long as activemilitary operations  are  in progress.     Switzerland. In the  Western  and General Report  for  the  weeks  ending onAugust Phh and 21st reference was made to the possibility of  neutral interventionwhich  was  discussed in both  Denmark and  Sweden.   The idea has now been putforward  in  Switzerland and  is warmly supported  by  the Homer Tagblatt, but thegreater part  of the  Press would  appear to be  opposed  to it.  (See the Daily Reviewof  the  Foreign  Press  (Neutral Press Supplement).)  E.g., the Easier Ngclirichien(August  14th): &quot; What we   wrote  on dune  7th  applies again to-day.   Then the offensive of  the Central Powers was at  its maximum ; now it  is that of  the Entente.Mediation can only  be of  service in the  intervals between offensives.  So we are notsorry that Switzerland  does not  figure  on the  Reichspost&apos;s list of neutrals that areeager to mediate.  It may keep its peace powder dry ! &quot;     Nevertheless,  the  possibility  of  intervention  by  neutral  States is frequentlydiscussed in some German papers.     Sir Id. Rumbold reports that Troelstra appears  to be trying to organise a meeting in Switzerland between four German deputies,  three of whom are to be Scheidemanii,Haussmann and Fehrenbach, and four British representatives of equal standing.  Hehopes to have the assistance of M. van Kol who has asked the British representative at The Hague to obtain permission for him to visit England.     Russia. Three treaties,  supplementary to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, between russia and  Germany were signed  at  Berlin on August  27th.  Among other pointsthey dealt with -     (I)  The  regulation  of the  border States,  especially  of  Esthonia  and Livonia.            Eastward of these States Russia is  to be free to manage her own internal            affairs.     (2)  Legal  relations, which are  to be dealt wdth by two  international, tribunals            sitting  in Moscow  and Berlin,  each  composed  of  a  Danish  President            assisted by  one  Russian and. one German judge.     (3)  Finance.   Provision  is made for the  mutual returns of  bank deposits and            credits, and  the balance clue to  Germany is to be settled by the payment    &apos;        of six milliards  of marks (30O,000,O0OL)  by Russia.     The great  advantage which  will  accrue  to Russia  from  this  arrangement isexplained by the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung and  reproduced in the german wireless of August 31st.     Further details of these supplementary treaties  are given in the Russian Wirelessof September 4th and in the British Press on  the  5th.   The most noteworthy  pointsare :      (1)  125,000,0007. to be paid in gold and paper money.     (2)  Germany to evacuate Russia  east  of  the border States when  Russia has            fulfilled her financial obligations which she is to do in four months.
     (3) Russia to fight against the Entente troops.in the north.     (4) Finland not to attack Russia.     (5) Russia has the right of tax-free transit to  Reval,  Riga,  Windau,  and their           free ports and territories.     (6) The Baku district is assured to Russia, who gives a certain quantity of oil to           Germany.   v  Referring  to  these treaties  the Daily Review of the Foreign  Press reproduces  a message from Stockholm reporting a declaration  made by the Esthonian delegation on behalf  of the  Provisional  Esthonian Government.  It  concludes with the words :&quot; We declare, most emphatically,  in the name  of  the  Esthonian  Republic, that anytreaty concluded between the German Imperial Government and  the Russian Sovietsconcerning  the  political  status  of Esthonia  without the  formal  consent  of  the democratic representatives  of the  Esthonian people and the Provisional Government,is of no  validity  for  Esthonia  and  its  people,  and is  by  them considered  nulland  void.&quot;     Italy. The  Socialist Deputy Turati has presented the following resolution tothe  Socialist Congress at  Rome: &quot;When the  proletariats  fail to  impose on  theGovernments their desire for peace all insurrectional action bearing upon one singlebelligerent country or on one army alone  without the support of the proletariat ofall other countries would  have the effect of  giving decisive help to  the enemy in thewar.  Therefore it is absolutely necessary to arrive  at a collective agreement of theproletariat of all the belligerent nations so as to impose peace on Capitalism.&quot;     Grea,t Britain. At the Trades Union Congress at Derby on September 4th,  aresolution was passed calling upon  the Government to  initiate peace negotiationsimmediately the enemy either voluntarily or by compulsion should evacuate Franceand  Belgium.     A short account of the  proceedings of this Congress will be issued as an appendix to the next number of the Western and General Report.
