The matter of greatest  interest is  that referring to the activities of  Socialistextremists in Holland and in France.    An important report has jnst been received  from Sir E. Howard (July 25th) thatthe peace negotiations between Finland and Russia will take  place in Berlin, insteadof at Reval.                               GENERAL (see page 2).    Information about the  British foreign trade policy, as affecting neutral and enemy states, is important.                               ALLIED COUNTRIES.    Belgium  (see  page  3). The  Fatherland  Party  is  struggling  against  anyrecognition  of moral obligations by the German Government.    France (see  page 4). Foclds  recent successes  seem to have had  a good effect upon  public opinion.    Haiti (see page 5). Has declared war against Germany.     Japan (see page 5). Appears to be ready to co-operate with the  United states in Siberia.                                ENEMY COUNTRIES.     Austria-Hungary (see  page 6).  Reported German intrigues are worth noting.     Germany  (see page 7). Reports of the moral of  the  Army are of interest, as affecting the prospects of  the  military authorities continuing to rule absolutely over the nation.

    Finland (see page 9). Information under this heading is very important.   there seems  to  be a  partial  recognition of the fact  that  the  Germans  care  nothing for Finland, and are merely seeking their own advantage.    The attitude of the Norwegian Press on the Finnish question is of interest.   (see also under &quot;Peace Discussions.&quot;)    Honduras (see page 13).

PART  II.-FOREIGN  AND  GENERAL.GENERAL.    Sinkings. According to the War Trade  Intelligence Bureau,  the  total tonnageof 500 tons gross  in  the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in  the case of sading-ships, reported lost owing  to the malice of  the  King&apos;s enemies  during  the period july- 12th-18th, inclusive, was  60,243  tons gross,  of which 40,152 were  British,  ascompared with 47,879 tons  gross, of which 29,554 were British, reported last week.    The Admiralty reports, regarding British vessels sunk, that  the  figures for Juneare the lowest  recorded, in respect both of number and tonnage,  since the  commence-ment  of unrestricted  submarine warfare; while  as regards Worlds tonnage thefigures are the lowest  in number in any month since July 1916, and in  tonnage since september of that year.    The &quot; Koningin Regentes.&quot; AVith reference to the inquiry  by the Dutch ShippingCouncil into the sinking of the Koningin Regentes (see Reports Nos. 72-74 and 77), theNieuive Rotterdamsche Courant of July 19th  writes : &quot; There can surely  remain hutfew who doubt that the Koningin Regentes wras  really torpedoed.   By whom the shipwras torpedoed was not established during the hearing.  One can therefore only draw the conclusion  already known.   We only judge from  what we have seen to be thegeneral rule in this war.  If this were the first hospital ship to  be torpedoed,  therewould be room for doubt, but the number of  hospital vessels  which have met theirfate in this manner is  legion, and, so far as we know, the case has yet to be proved ofa neutral or hospital ship being torpedoed by the  forces of the Entente.&quot;  german wireless of July 20th (Serials 5449  and 5452) suggests that the  ship was torpedoedby a British submarine in  the hope that the act might be attributed  to Germany and thereby  create a feeling against Germany in &quot;neutral Holland.   The  Foreign  Officelearns  that the Dutch Shipping Companies concerned  in the  transport of prisonersare not satisfied wdth the statement  that no British  mines have been laid on the route.While  recognising that sweeping operations cannot be effected by  the Germans, theyare anxious for an assurance by His  Majesty&apos;s Government that certain  areas are free from mines of any nationality.   Sir W. d^wnley has been instructed  to  inform theNetherlands Government and the Dutch Shipping Companies  that no  British mines have been or will be laid on the routes authorised for the prisoners of war  transports,nor will hostile action be taken  against such ships  while carrying prisoners of war on their prescribed routes.   Further, that a channel between, the Leman Bank  light and. the Docking Buoy has been  swept  and traffic can now be resumed.    Anglo-German  Prisoners  Agreement. In  the  course  of  a  Memorandum  (G.T.5135),  dated July 16th, the  Home Secretary states   that the Anglo-German PrisonersAgreement provides for the exchange of 15,000 private soldiers  on each side, as wellas some of the older prisoners, before any  officer or non-commissioned officer  isrepatriated.  (And  see  Report  No.  77.)   A  summary of the  proposed agreement isgiven in a Memorandum (G.T. 5196) dated July 23rd.    Most-favoured-nation Policy. The Foreign  Office  reports     On  June  .15thdespatches were addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Representatives in all neutral countries instructing them  to inform the Governments of those countries that duringthe period of reconstruction, after the termination of hostilities, it would probably notbe possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government  to afford them  in  every respect as in thepast most-favoured-nation treatment, but that, so far as supplies,  Sc. were  concerned,our present Allies would come first.   We did not, however, propose  to denounce our commercial treaties or agreements with the several States,  and trusted that  they, intheir turn, would not  make what we regarded as a  debt of honour  to our Allies  an excuse to terminate the commercial relations which had so happily existed hitherto
between Great Britain and the neutral countries.  Almost simultaneously (on June29th) despatches were addressed to the same countries announcing that  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not permit their various commercial treaties and agreements to be-utilised to shelter the subjects, goods, ships, companies, industries, &amp;c, belonging toour  present enemies, Germany  and Austria-Hungary.   On  duly 6th  the AlliedGovernments were informed of what  had  been done,  and were told that  during thereconstruction period it was the intention of  His Majesty&apos;s Government  to give to itsAllies equal though  not  necessarily  identical treatment.&quot;  (And see Reports Nos. 65and  66 under &quot; France,&quot; and 76 under &quot; United States.&quot;)ALLIED  GROUP.                                   BELGIUM.    Germany  and the Belgian Pawn. With reference to Count Hertling&apos;s statement in the Main Committee of the  Reichstag,  on July 11th, regarding Belgium (seeReport  No. 77),  the  Vaterlandspartei has, according to  a Press report, issued  amanifesto to the following effect : &quot; As far as we are concerned, Belgium is a pledge to safeguard a lasting peace, to strengthen Germany&apos;s hand in Belgium,  to preserveit from Anglo-American exploitation, to protect the  Flemings from the &apos;  frenchitica-tion &apos;  (h&apos;ranzdisierung)  of their German industries, and from British  tyranny.  we want a free Flanders and  a real  guarantee for the vital necessities  of  the Germanpeople.&quot;    Referring  to the same speech,  and particularly  to  the question of theabandonment  of separate  Flemish and Walloon policies, Count Reventiowr, writes  inthe Tageszeitung (July 15th) : -&quot;It would certainly be useless  to  pursue a separateFlemish and Walloon policy if later a Belgium is to revive which shall be independent.Such  &apos; independence &apos; would only mean dependence on our  enemies-that is the dependence for which Belgium  is now already striving and.  longing.  An independentFlanders  and  Wallonia are unthinkable except  under German rjolitical direction.The  Belgian State and the present Dynasty have become in the course  of the war thepersonification and symbol  of  our  enemies.  This can only  be  prevented by tirepartition of Belgium, by the removal  of its dynasty, and by the equal development and progress of both its races under German protection.&quot;    Herr Maximilian Harden makes the following criticism in the Znkunft: &quot;Cana country he regarded as ah independent  State which is only to be returned to theowner, when negotiations with 20 other States have reached a favourable  conclusion ?Can  a country be regarded  as an independent State which before  its return mustfurther undertake precisely to adapt its policy and its economy, and, consequently,  itsentire State life, to the will of the enemy Power still ruling on% its soil, which mustguarantee that Power against French,  British, and American thirst for revenge, andwdrich must even be friends with that Powrer and grant  it privileged  -confidence ?Primary law  or  international  law that  alone is  the question.  International lawforbids  Germany to retain  even, one pebble of BelgiunPs  streets  and commandsGermany to restore the  kingdom in the extent, possessions, and sovereignty which ithad  before the invasion.  Is Belgium, as  a Chancellor, a  Secretary of State, and  an ambassador have, in  the name  of the Kaiser and the Federal Governments, confessed,the innocent victim of German self-defence&apos;?  Then we have  to ask  its  forgiveness,and  not, in addition, to force  conditions  upon it.  This  is a  question  of- decency,morality, and  the honour of a nation.&quot;                                    CHINA.    German Leases in British Concessions. The Foreign Office requests the views ofSir J. Jordan as to the best means for ridding British concessions in China of GermanState buildings and trading centres.
    British. Shipbuilders in China. The Foreign Office instructs Sir J. Jordan that itis desirable that British shipbuilders in China should devote their whole resources tothe construction of  vessels of as large a size as possible  for employment by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.  An expert surveyor will shortly be appointed to proceed  to china in this connection ; meanwhile all applications for new construction should bereferred to London.    livssian Boxer Indemnity. The  Foreign Office authorises Sir J. Jordan to  join with the French and Japanese representatives  at Peking  in  supporting the  RussianMinister in his application to the Chinese Government  for the release of instalmentsdue from the Russian Boxer  indemnity sufficient to provide for the maintenance  ofRussian  diplomatic  and consular establishments  in the Far East.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is not prepared to support the further application for funds to be applied for eventual political action in Siberia.    German Propaganda regarding Allied Designs  in China. German Wireless-  ofJuly 18th states : &quot; When the news  of the  conclusion  of the Treaty of Alliance  ofMay 16th,  1918, between Japan and China  appeared in the Press, this further step onthe part of Japan towards the &apos; peaceful penetration &apos; of China caused less surprise  inthe world  than  the announcements from London and Washington, published at thesame time, to the effect  that they had  not been  informed of the exact contents of theTreaty.  This announcement seemed very improbable at the time,  at  least so  far as england was concerned, and  the suspicion was several times expressed that japan had previously secured  the agreement of the British  Government to the conclusion  ofthe Treaty by the cession of certain economic advantages to England.  This suspicion as the Kolnisehe Zeitung points out is now confirmed by  the persistent  rumours of an Anglo-Japanese agreement which determines the mutual interests of Englandand Japan  in  China for 25 years.   It  is a  question  of making  China a  moderncommercial State under Japanese monopoly,  but with  special  consideration forBritish  interests.  Her  finances are  to be  under  English  and  Japanese  control.In return China will receive from both States the necessary loans for  the  develop-ment  of  the country.    England,  however,  will  not  recognise  the Treaty unlessJapan succeeds in reconciling the two hostile parties in China in the north and in thesouth, and in obtaining their  consent  to the agreement.   On  the other hand,  Englandbinds herself to obtain America&apos;s recognition of the agreement, and of Japan&apos;s rightto conclude  this Treaty.  Finally,  the agreement  with  England provides  for themeasures which must be taken with regard to the territorial questions of both powers in East Asia in case of meeting with a refusal from  America, and what  Englancbstask will  be in the  event of energetic action by  America  against Japan.  In  thisconnection, Siam, the  Philippines,   and the  Dutch  Colonies  are  mentioned.    Ifmatters wrere to develop as  is  imagined  in  London  from  this announcement, theprospects for the future will be very alluring for English  statesmen ; the three great powers of  the  Pacific England, America,  and Japan combined, and,  of course,with all possible exclusion of other   .   .  .   but not Japan, as  is now thought  inTJokio, as  leader of the combination,  but firmly held between the two powerful oldpartners in order to prevent desires which  are too far-reaching.&quot;   (See  also  reports nos. 69 and 71-73.)                                   FRANCE.     French Morale. On July 21st Mr. Grahame reported : &quot; Public spirit has been rising steadily during the last few days.  The announcement to-day that the germans have been driven back across the Marne has revived the happiest memories of 1914.Confidence has never since that  date  been greater than it is at  the present time,nor have the  feelings or grateful acknowledgment of the share of France&apos;s principalAllies in bringing about the altered situation, ever been  more widespread and sincere.&quot;     Protest by Confeclercd  Labour Congress regarding Malvy Trial (and see reports nos. 66, 69  and  77). Mr. Grahame reports that as a protest against the referencesmade in the  Report of the Commission of enquiry and  indictment during the trial of Monsieur Malvy  relative to the latteFs excessive  consideration for the activities ofthe Labour classes, the  Confederal Congress  adopted  on  July 18th the following
resolution: &apos; The Confederated Congress, composed of representatives of more than11,000 Labour  syndicates, indignant at the infamous police accusations submitted tothe High Court of Justice!, invented from beginning to end in order to injure the honour of the working class,  holds up  to general contempt the miserable individuals whodare to perform this abject task.  It confirms its resolution not to tolerate a campaignwhich is directed both against the liberties  of the working classes and the honour ofthe mihtants, and which cannot but recoil, as its originators  intend it should, on  theRepublic itself.&apos;&quot;                                     HAITI.    Declaration of War  with  Germany. Mr. Kohan reports  the  declaration  by theGovernment of Haiti on July 12th of war with the German Empire.   (The appendix to Report No. 72 should be amended accordingly ;  diplomatic  relations  were severedon June 16th, 1917.)   The Foreign  Office  has requested the  Haitian Minister  to convey  to his  Government an expression of the gratification felt by  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.                                    ITALY.    Position of  Baron  Sonnino. The  Foreign  Office  learns  that  feeling againstBaron  Sonnino  has hardened  owing to his unsympathetic attitude  towards  theproposed Jugo-Slav Conference.   It would seem  that his resignation  cannot  now belong deferred.  (See also Report No. 77.)                                    JAPAN.    Question of  Intervention in Siberia. Sir C.  Greene  reports that there  is  aprobability that the Japanese Government will accept a  proposal  made  to  it by theUnited States Government for  co-operation in a limited scheme  of  intervention in siberia.  The Advisory Council is stated to favour this proposal, but to have opposeda suggestion submitted by the Cabinet  (and.  believed to be approved  by the ElderStatesmen) for operations  on  a larger  scale.   The  higher national and internationalimportance  of  the  issue  is  unfortunately  at  present  somewhat  obscured day  a recrudescence of  the rivalry between the Satsuma and Choshu clans, the former, inits advocacy of  naval expansion,  deprecating expenditure upon continental militaryenterprise, for which the  latter presses.  The Bolshevist Government  has recentlyattempted by offers of commercial  and fiscal concessions in Russia to  dissuade theJapanese Government from participating in any scheme of Allied intervention.                                   PANAMA.    Date of Declaration of War with Germany. The Foreign Office  observes that,according to a  law of Panama (November 20th, .1917), the Republics  date of warwith Germany is April 7th, 1917, not April  10th.  The Appendix to Report No.  72.should therefore be amended accordingly.                              UNITED STATES.     The Irish Question. Despatches dated 27th and  29th June from. Lord Reading-indicate  the importance  of  the Irish question as affecting American  relations withGreat Britain. Well-informed opinion seems to show that the situation in Chicago andthe  Middle West upon  this  question  is  particularly serious.   Prejudice  against     6073- 41;                           B
England, whether justifiable or not, .is deep-seated and always ready to revive.  Thesuperficial  enthusiasm aroused by the  war was largely based upon  expectation ofHome Rule.  Reaction followed, first, upon the elevation  of  Sir Edward Carson tothe Cabinet, and secondly upon the suppression of the rebellion in 1916 ;  the Irish inAmerica refused to  take  into consideration that, in the first case, Mr. John Redmondhad also been offered a  seat in  the Cabinet, and in the  second, that thousands ofgallant Irishmen  were offering their  lives in France  and  Gallipoli.   A great  move-ment is on foot to  make the matter a Party question.  The  promoters are carelesswhether  President  Wilson or  the Republicans  pronounce  the  benediction.  Dis-appointment  in the matter of Home  Rule would pre-dispose  Irish Americans to theacceptance of German suggestions of peace to the disadvantage of England, and theywould be in a position to bring strong pressure  to  bear at Washington.   The failureof  the British Government  to  produce  detailed  evidence regarding the  Germanintrigue in Ireland, and  the postponement of  the  adoption of  conscription  havealready created the  feeling among Americans  that Ireland  has after all  a legitimategrievance.  Efforts  are, however, still being made by moderate Irish opinion to make clear the  distinction between the  Sinn Fein  faction-and the  loyal Irish Americans.If a fair Home Rule Bill  could  be passed for Ireland,  there is reason  to believe thatIrish-Americans generally would directly and forcibly tell Ireland  that she has got toaccept it  and  would  make it  quite plain that  she would  receive no sympathywhatever on  the  behalf  of any wild and greater ambitions.   (And see Reports Nos.70 and 75.)      &apos;  - -     And see  under  &quot; Chile.&quot;ENEMY  GROUP.                             AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    Reported Resignation of Seidler Cabinet. German Wireless of  July 23rd  reports from Vienna the resignation of Dr. SeidleFs Cabinet.    Political Conditions. A neutral  observer  reports that, although  the desire for peace  is universal in Austria, the prospect of a separate peace is quite out of thequestion.   He quotes the  remark of an Austrian Foreign Office official that it wouldbe as impossible for Austria-Hungary to contemplate a separate peace as for  france to do so, even  if offered  unconditional restitution of Alsace-Lorraine.  He considersNationalist  or  Socialist, . upheavals  unlikely.  Austria,  Bohemia  and Hungary arevigorously policed by forces belonging in each  case to a  State other than  that inwhich, they serve.  A. Czech  rising is improbable, unless promoted by the Germansfor their own ends.  With regard  to  Hungary, the political crisis in connection withthe suffrage question is  not  considered  by this  observer as  being  of a menacingcharacter.     Another neutral informant considers  the  disintegration of Austria-Hungaryinevitable  and  the end of  the  Dual Monarchy to be at hand.   He  thinks it not impossible  that before  the  new harvest a general revolution may break out as theresult of hunger combined  with political events.  According  to this informant theLuclendorff party is scheming to dismember Austria, to make of her  what germany has  made  of Western  Russia,  and  to lean towards liungary over Austria&apos;s head.Prince Max Egon  Fuerstenberg-, the German diplomatic  representative at Buda  Pest,is stated to be playing an important part  in this intrigue, the Emperor  Charles being&apos;:&apos; ein unbedeutencler  Mensch.&quot;  This view is borne out independently  by an anti-militarist German, who  states  that Austria is a negligible quantity militarily speaking,while  Hungary impresses Germany  by contrast  more and  more  with its strength.Fuerstenberg is in sympathy with Hungarian national aspirations, and is consequentlysuspect to  many Germans ;  but  for this very reason of his Hungarian  sympathies lieis kept at  his post, probably  at the instance of the German military party,  who wishto form a close military alliance with Hungary  over Austria&apos;s head.   In the opinion o 
a,                                  GERMANY.    Adjournment of Reichstag. The Reichstag has  adjourned until November 5th,though the Main  Committee  ma*y meet before that date.   The votes of credit were passed and the Majority Socialists at the last moment  thought better of their decisionto vote against Government.    Direction of Policy. Criticisms upon German  direction (or want of direction)of policy appear in the Frankfurter Zeitung of. June 29th and&apos;July 17th.  .The formerissue observes :     &quot; Foreign policy as pursued by us is an inarticulate confusion of several currentsfighting and intriguing one against another.   The  German nation  would  be terror-struck if it knew  what manifold influences have a hand in the Government.  Peoplecomplain  that we have pursued a wrong  policy ; we  have by no means pursued  onepolicy but 10 or  15 policies,  right and wrong, mixed together. .... When foreigncountries  see several  persons  with great influence  in  the State  pursuing in thiscountry quite varying policies, when they see  that  the  intentions of one  side are.openly crossed by another, when every declaration of  those governing is immediatelyhalf recalled by a subsequent statement, and a jangling dispute rages in the papersregarding  the two  interpretations of it,  the  world must assuredly come to theconclusion that the German political  system is  a system of falsehood.   That  is,believe me, a main reason why we do not reach peace. Our declarations are given nocredit.  There is only one reform of foreign policy.  It  consists in the  reform ofinternal  policy.&quot;   The issue of  July 17th remarks, first, upon  the obscurity  andweakness of the  Chancellor^ declaration, and, secondly, upon  the  disclosure by theSocialist Deputy Noske that  the military  authorities had.  censored,  or put their owninterpretation upon, the  speech  of von Kubhnann.   Although the Majority7 partiesranged themselves  behind the secretary  of State, and though the  Chancellor himself would seem  to have supported him, the  victory was nevertheless  with  the minorityvdiich agreed with the military authorities.  &quot;The  relationship between the politicalchiefs and the military has  taken  such a form in the world-war that  01ausewitz&apos;sprinciple,  according to which the  Army  should  be the  instrument of policy,  can hardly now be maintained in its original sense.  The  relations have now become such that the partner who  directs and  decides is the Chief Command  of  the  Army.  it shows our war  policy the paths in which it is to go, fixes its objects  and lays downlimits which may not be exceeded.&quot;  The article concludes  by insisting  that thesituation should be cleared up by the Reichstag.   (And see Reports Nos. 76 and 77.)     Army Morale. According to  information  received  by the Foreign  Office theGerman Army Command appears to be so much afraid of  revolutionary contaminationin the trenches that it has organised a regular interchange of soldiers from the frontto the rear,  so that a man holding advanced views will, within a week, find himselfamong completely different comrades before he has had time to cause any effervescencein his particular  unit.     Germany  and  Centred-Asian  Cotton. A   Memorandum - (G.T.  5119),  dated july  11th, examines the  efforts  made  by Germany to  obtain  cotton  in  CentralAsia.  It  is  pointed  out that  there is  no possibility of  Germany obtaining from&quot;Middle  Europe-and-Asia&quot;  supplies in  sufficient  quantity or at  an early enoughthis observer,  such a policy is  likely to conflict  with the independent  aspirations ofHungarian nationalists.    Food Conditions. According to  information  received by the Foreign Office the weekly bread  ration in Vienna for two persons is a loaf varying from 1,200 to 1,250grammes.  The bread  is black  and contains practically no flour.  The weekly ration of meat  is 20 grammes per person.  Rice, potatoes, and vegetables are  at presentcompletely lacking.  The daily mortality at Vienna, which before the war was 5u0, hasnow risen to 2,000, one case in  every 20 being attributable to starvation.   In Galiciaand among the Jugo-Slavs  the state of famine is worse than in any other part of theEmpire.   In Hungary  and  Bohemia food conditions are more favourable.
date to compensate to any particular  degree for the loss of  the  pre-war importsfrom overseas.  It is observed that Russian competition will again have to be faced, andalso that there is at present a steady diminution of cotton in favour of cereal cultivation.A post-war distribution of raw cotton on the basis of the war  would be ruinous  toGermany, or, in other words, the economic war  in respect  of cotton  offers  an extremely favourable basis for bargaining from the Allied point  of view.   &quot;Germany,called in to reconstruct Central Asia by a population weary of Bolshevist  domination,would be a formidable menace to the British Empire in the Middle East, and she will no doubt be tempted to pursue this political objective.   On the  other  hand, our best way of bargaining her out of it is to emphasise the  economic ruin, in respect  of thecotton  industry, which it involves for her, and  to  hold out to her  the. prospect  ofobtaining a share in the immediate cotton production of Egypt and  America  if shewill renounce the political ascendency in  Central Asia (and with it, of course, theultimate economic monopoly) which the war map has placed in her  hands.&quot;   (and see  Reports Nos. 67, 70 and 75.)

CHILE.    Prospective Provision of  British Aircraft to Chile. -Lord  Reading reports thatthe United States Government is anxious that the delivery of aircraft proposed  to heprovided by Great Britain to Chile (see Reports Nos. 73 under  &quot; Chile &quot;  and 74 and75 under &quot; Peru &quot;), should be  deferred until  after the war.  Apart from the reason that anxiety in  the matter is felt by Peru and Bolivia, the United States Governmentfinds it difficult to understand  the delivery of these machines to Chile at a time  whenurgent requests are being put forward  by Great Britain for  the  supply of Libertymachines from  the United States.                                  DENMARK.    Danish Commercial Negotiations with Belligerents.-T:he  German government still declines to approve the cession  to the Allies of more than 400,000 tons of Danishshipping, and  the Associated  Governments will not accept less than  465,000  tons.Danish vessels  sailing between  neutral ports are  at  present allowed  German safe-conducts provided they carry no enemy passengers  and give an  undertaking that none  of  the cargo carried will be re-exported from the country of destination.   the danes are  insisting that the  receipt by Denmark of fertilizers shall be an  essential condition of any agreement.   There is thus as yet no settlement with regard  either totonnage or rations.   Lord Reading has  submitted  proposals for a possible accommo-clation.  The Germans in their negotiations for a renewal  of the German-DanishEconomic Agreement are pressing  for (a) Danish fats in compensation for Germandrugs  and  chemicals,  and  (?))  Danish  horses  in compensation  for  German rawmaterials required by the Danish industries, such as coal, iron,  potash, and  soda.His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to offer Denmark reasonable  quantities  of  thedrugs and chemicals which she is trying to  obtain from Germany, and is enquiringwhat supplies are likely to be needed.  The Danes have already agreed to  continue their exports of cattle to Germany at the old prices.   Germany, however, has agreed to payincreased prices  for Danish butter,  namely,  400 crovfns per cask in August, 425 inSeptember, and 450 in October and November.   Germany is also understood to have promised Denmark a monthly  supply of 400 tons of petroleum, of which 200 is  to heused  by the fishing fleets&apos;conditionally on the monthly exportation to  Germany of2,100 tons of fish.

(And  see reports nos. 68 and 74 ; also 69 and 73 under &apos;: Norway.&quot;)    Scandinavian Conference. The following observations are made by the SwedishPress  upon the  recent  Scandinavian  Conference  at  Copenhagen   (see ReportNo. 75) : &quot; For the first time it has  been definitely stated that the policy of economic co-operation is not to come to&quot; an end  with the  declaration of peace.   The war hastaught the Scandinavian nations the  importance of  belonging to a larger economic unit, and  the lesson -will not  be lost &quot; (Dagens  Nyheter,  June 29th).   &quot; experience has shown that even a  problematical chance of relief in the shape of imports can onlybe  purchased  at  a   great  sacrifice  and at  the  risk of  political and   economicindependence, and the  situation is  not likely.to improve during the transition periodfollowing  the war.   The  Great Powers  will  continue to pursue their harsh andselfish&quot;  trade policy  without any  consideration  for the   smaller  States,  and scandinavia  will  need all. the strength  which  unity can  give.  What  is meantby  social legislation  is  left in obscurity, but  in  the treatment  of foreigners  all three  countries  have   hitherto   been  too   lax.   It  is  to  be hoped   that  themeasures  foreshadowed, which involve giving a preferential  status to Scandinavians,will be canned  out at once.  The existing  arrangements  for  the  interchange of commodities are proof that the  policy of  rapprochement  has  already assumed apractical  shape&quot; (Slockholms Dagblad, June  29th and  30th).  The value  of Danishexports to Sweden is stated by Arbetet of duly 1st to have increased from Kr. 850,000in January and February 1917, to  Kr. 24,000,000 during  the same months in 191.8.The Activist, Aftonhladet (June 26th), hopes  that Finland  may eventually become amember of the Scandinavian group of nations.  With regard to Norwegian comments,Morgenbladet  (June  29th) especially  urges  the need  of hastening  the  plans  forguaranteeing neutral rights at a peace conference, for though one should be preparedfor a continuation of  the war, yet  peace might come like a thief  in the night.Co-operation in social  policy is a new departure, and Norway  might certainly  learnmuch from the experience of  Sweden and Denmark.  Six of these meetings have now-been held, and as the  agreements with  the  Entente have now been  concluded thegeneral state of foreign relations is better, at least for  Sweden and Norway, while itis to be hoped that Denmark -will soon arrange this matter too.  Steady and continuousco-operation  in  internal affairs ought to make the position of  Scandinavia stronger.Scandinavia has decreased  in  size owing to the latest developments in the  East, andit is  therefore  all the more  needful that  the  real  Scandinavian  North  shouldconsolidate  itself  as well  as  possible under the wholly free forms which  have  beenrightly  chosen  for co-operation.   It is pointed out in several papers that the  idea ofco-operation  in  social  policy is the work of  Castberg, by whom it has always beenadvocated.  In an interview Castberg explains to Tid-ens Tegn (July 3rd) that thispolicy in a broad sense means  the holding of congresses, the  employment of  social.statistics,  and a sort of organised propaganda wdiich may lead to the general improve-ment of social cotiditions in the three countries by mutual co-operation and  assistance.From a still wider standpoint Castberg holds that if  this plan were  developed in a european and  international  sense it would tend to remove social differences, and  thewrongs, together with&apos;the&apos;mutual feelings of  suspicion  and envy that have been  thecause of the present war, which is  the shame of Christendom.  The peoples of  theNorth may thus show the way and render a priceless service  to the cause of a lasting-peace.                                   FINLAND.    Finland and  the  North. The Foreign  Office  learns that  the  Finnish troops available for employment by the Germans in the Northern adventure amount to about40,000.   They are, however, ill-trained and also somewhat unreliable, since they areirregularly paid and  insufficiently  fed,  in addition to -which their  sentiments are largely republican. It is  stated that many of  the  soldiers  wish to return to their    6073-46                              C
homes,  and that serious mutinies  have taken place.   According  to  the  Idelsingforscorrespondent  of  Svenska Dagbladet (July 22nd),  the  Finnish Commander-in-chief has issued an  order against anti-militarist agitation  in the Army, which it says iscarried  on by  foreign agents.   The rank and file are warned not to  intrigue againstthe army command, and officers are urged to check  any lack of discipline.  Owing to german dominance and strict censorship, it is impossible for the popular wishes to bemanifested, but it is believed that  GO per cent, at least of the people are anti-German.The fact that the Germans care nothing for- Finland, and are merely seeking their ownadvantage, is beginning to be recognised.  Practically no  party now wishes-for warwith  the Allies;  Swedes, Young  Finns, and Republicans  are working  against  it.Members of the Diet who have recently heard of  the Finnish Governments Note ofJune 26th to Sir E. Howard (see  Report No.  &apos;75)  are  much concerned.  It isremarked that  the Note was almost contemporaneous  with the  Bolshevist demand for allied withdrawal from the Murmansk  Railway (see Report  No.  73), and that bothbear  the stamp of German inspiration ;  it  is further seen that hostilities with  theEntente would involve an alliance between the Finnish Bourgeoisie and the RussianBolshevists.   Sir  E. Howard has  conveyed to the  Finnish Government an intimation that the Allies are  acting upon a united policy in the North. He has expressed for their information his belief that the aspirations of  Finland for a northern port would  be&quot;favourably received by the Allies at the peace settlement, provided she maintainedher  neutrality, but has deprecated  the cutting off of  Russia&apos;s access to the  sea in eastern Karelia.   He has pointed out that  the  Allies  would be  unable to recognise the  proposed  cession of  Eastern  Karelia  to Finland by the Bolshevist Government,since they did  not recognise that  Government  itself.   With regard to the suggestionstated to have  been made by General Mannerheim that the Allies should provisionallyassent to the acquisition by Finland of the territories which had been recoguised bythe Bolshevist  Government  as belonging, to Finland, the Foreign  Office considers thatsuch action is  undesirable for the following reasons : First, it would seem  illogicalthat  His Majesty&apos;s Government, which  has  not yet recognised the independence off inland, should recognise the acquisition by Finland of what is  at  present Russianterritory.  Secondly, there  are obvious objections  to  depriving Russia of territory ata moment when  there is  no Russian  Government in existence,  nor, indeed,  any government,  recognised  or unrecognised, wdiich can properly be regarded  as repre-senting the Russian people.   Thirdly, Finland could in no circumstances be  allowedso long as she is entirely controlled by  Germany,  to obtain access to the white  sea or the Arctic  Ocean, since  this would enable Germany to create  submarine  bases inpositions where they would seriously imperil, if they did not wholly destroy, the onlyaccess to the  West still  open  to  European  Russia.  It is considered likely that theepidemic of cholera in the Petrograd district will defer German-Finnish operations against the  Murmansk  railway,  which  is probably  the  main objective.   UponPetschenga, which is reported as their minor  objective, a large German force is alreadyadvancing.  The  Daily Review (N.P.S.) of July 19th shows that the Norwegian Pressevidently takes a very serious view of  developments in Finland.   ddie independentpaper  Verdens Gang (J uly  14th) in an article headed  &quot; Finland atthe Cross-roads&quot;tells Finland plainly what the result will be if she pursues her present course.   &quot;Finland begins  to feel  the effects of German oppression, and  even-pro-German papers  like Wasabladet begin to react against it.  The same hand  of iron as under Tsarism has fallen on all public criticism.  The Press is  muzzled and  deprived of its rights, and the Senate is  occupied  with the  question of limiting  the freedom  of meetings  and unions..  It seems strange that the same Finnish rulers  who suffered under the Russian system are now establishing a system of reaction.  The mildest explanation is  that power  has slipped out of their hands, and a situation created which has made them almost helpless in their own  country.  It is  a question for  history whether it  was necessary to call in the Germans against the Red peril, and thus  to come into intimate relationship with the most  reactionary Power in Europe.   The Bolshevists made the task of the Germans easy.   The  programme of an  Arctic port  and of  Karelia  was held up as the natural aim of  a progressive foreign  policy.   The real German plans became clearer as their leaders got a firmer hold of the Finnish army after Mannerheim and others had  left it,  full  of doubt over the development of events.  And hence- forward  the  Finnish claims became a natural part of the German programme to secure  a base  for their U-boats in the Arctic.   Moreover, the  critical position of the Bolshevists in connection with Entente operations  on  the Murman coast was  a fresh ground for driving Finland farther on the path of  war and conquest, so that  now she is in the very  act of being drawn  into the  war a second time, on  this occasion  against
the Entente, while there is  already talk of expelling British  subjects.   But if theconditions are such as are described in. the Swedish accounts of the starving conditionof Finland, it seems almost incredible that her rulers should be mad enough to plungeher  into a fresh war.&quot;   The article  concludes  with the following warning: &quot;IfFinland decides to  take  an active part in the war on  Germany&apos;s side,  she will havetaken a new and more than ever fateful step away from community with the rest ofthe North.   She will  in  the  first place  have broken  with  the unshakable policy ofpeace and neutrality which the rest of the North has set up as the first and strongestcondition for co-operation in  the  present critical period, while in the second  place,by steering a southerly course, she has placed herself  in  an  exactly opposite  positionto the orientation westwards, whose importance has become more and more  plain tothe Northern peoples  at  the same time as the means and will for establishing it havebeen  increased.   Finland stands  at the cross-roads.  If she would avoid a break withthe North of immeasurable breadth, she must not go a step further on the way she hasstarted on.&quot;  Tidens Tegn (June 30th), in an article entitled  &quot; What is going on in theNorth ? &quot; draws attention to the North of Norway, and  the fact that  the world  war isapproaching her frontiers:  &quot; Already the news from Kirkenes shows that the  Germanadvanced, patrol is at Vaggesten on the Pasvik river, which is the boundary line, and theAnglo-Russian patrols are at Sahnijarvi.   If both advance they will meet in the PasvikA^alley,  south of Boris Gleb. Finland&apos;s  growing demand for an Arctic  port  is thecause of all this, and under the circumstances the Allies cannot permit it, for  it is not too much to say  that the  Germans are masters of Finland.  They arrange exports and imports, exercise censorship, and. advise the Government.  From &quot;brothers in arms &quot;the Finnish people have become subjects, and Finland must be counted as an  out-and-out vassal State of Germany.   A Finnish Arctic port will be merely a German one.The object aimed at is a  U-boat base in the Arctic.&quot;  The following criticisms appear in the Swedish Press : &quot; The country, above all things,  wants  rest,  but the presentrulers, not content wdtli perpetuating class hatred by the White Terror, have stirredup  a racial conflict and are  embarking on a campaign against Eastern Karelia  andthe well-disciplined Entente  troops  on the Murman Railway.  The fact  that (asNya  Dagllgt Allehanda&apos;s  correspondent observes),  &apos; whatever the  result,  theirdependence on Germany  must be  increased,&apos; troubles them not at all.   Truly  Finlandis on  the  broad  path  leading   to destruction.&quot;   (Social Demokraten,   July  2nd.)&quot; Finland has staked everything on a hypothetical German victory.  She has  taken no account of factors which may at  any  time overthrow  the foundations on which sheseeks to base her  independence.  She  has  already  alienated Russia and has nowchallenged England,  bier position when the eventual settlement  takes place  will notbe an enviable one.&quot;  (Arbetet, July 2nd.)     Food Supply. The Swedish  Minister for Foreign  Affairs has represented  to SirE. Howard that the question  of food supply in Finland is becoming  acute, and thatthere would be considerable feeling in Scandinavia if the Swedish-Finns, who numberabout  400,000,  should  starve.   Sir  E. Howard  has  pointed out  that  the  finnish government  has   already  been informed  of the  terms upon wdiich the  Alliescould  supply foodstuffs  (see Report  No. 63), the  principal of &quot;these   being theevacuation of Finland by the  Germans ; and that if the Germans refuse to leave, theresponsibility must lie with Germany,  ddie Finns would make a great mistake if theyrelied on Germany  rather than on the Allies to guarantee their future integrity.  Anarticle by Axel Westberg in Ah/a  Dagligt Allehanda of June  29th upon Finnish foodconditions  concludes: &quot;Hatred  against England, who  in  cold blood  has  allowedFinland  to  fall  into  the clutches  of  famine,  becomes  .... all  the  stronger.&quot;In  a  further  article in the  same  paper  on   July  19th, Westberg  suggeststhat the Scandinavian  countries should come to the rescue  of  Finland, and. thata campaign to that effect  should be started  in Sweden.  Tdie Foreign Office learnsthat  proposals  for such supply  were discussed  at  the  recent inter-Scandinavianmeeting  at Copenhagen, when  it  was  agreed  that should Finland  be  actuallythreatened with  famine, the Scandinavian Governments should request the permission of the Allied Governments to provide a limited  quantity of cereals to Finland  in orderto meet the crisis.   Notification has now been  made  by the  Swedish Government tothe Governments  of  Norway and Denmark that the occasion has arisen  for such a request.   Sir E. Howard has  pointed out  to the  Swedish Foreign  Minister that theproper course for the Finns would be. for them to  make clear to the Germans thatthere is no longer any necessity for the presence of  German troops in Finland, these
having already effected  the restoration of order which was the sole purpose for which their occupation had been invited, and for which Finland had already manifested hergratitude by accepting the Commercial Treaty.  (See Reports Nos. 59 and 75 and the daily Review (N.P.S.) of July 19th at page 186.)  Two incidents reported to the ForeignOffice indicate the attitude of the Germans with regard to Finlanchs food supply.   Inone instance the Germans have loaded  750 tons of Finnish butter in a transport for germany without giving compensation  in foodstuffs, as it  had been agreed that theyshould  do  in  such  cases.   It is stated that the Finnish Government  is detaining theship.   (According,  however, to Stockholm&apos;s Tabling a large cargo of cereals has now arrived at  Helsingfors from   Germany.)   In another instance the  Germans have declined to  give a safe conduct to  Finnish ships carrying zinc to Denmark in exchange for foodstuffs.   (It  appears that foodstuffs  are already being supplied  from denmark and that supplies from Holland and the Argentine are also contemplated.)     Scandinavia and the Swedish Finns. The Daily Review (N.P.S.) of  July 19thquotes extracts from the Scandinavian Press indicating the existence of strong feeling in  regard   to the  Fenoman  attitude  towards  the   Swedish  element in Finland.Thus,   Nya  Dagligt   Allehanda  observes : &quot; Finland,   by  placing   herself  in opposition  to  a North  Germanic stock,  becomes  an element  against  wdiich  the scandinavian group of  nations must be on their guard.   Possibly the  Fenomans are-relying on German  support.  If so, Germany would do well to define her attitude inregard to the conflict.   Swedish  policy may have been unwise, but we have at leastshown no  antipathy to Finnish Nationalism, whereas the  Finns, in treating  in  this manner a  people to whom  they  are so much indebted in  their fight for freedom, areacting in a spirit wholly inconsistent with the ideals for which they fought &quot; ; and TidensTegu says: &quot;There has been a strong movement in Finland against the Swedes..The semi-official Volkoinen Suomi. has stated that Finnish must  be the  only speech.The Government  has  acted  in  accordance  with  this.   Sveaborg  was changed toSuomenlina, which was a direct blow in the face to every Swede.  Then the Swedishofficers were driven out of  the army.  Then came the appointment of Sarid, who isthe most fanatical  of  all Fenomans, and  finally Senator Frey was forced to  resign.After all this the paragraphs about the Swedish rights came as a surprise, to expressit mildly, since  it  seemed for  a  moment as if  the Swedish Finns would  obtain theright to live in their own country, which was all they asked.   The explanation is thatthe Government needed the Swedish party&apos;s  support for a  Monarchy.  But Fenomannationalism would not stand this, and grew  more  aggressive every clay, until finailythe Swedish paragraphs were struck out of the Constitution.   It is the  death sentence of the Swedish element in Finland, for the Swedish  tongue can only hold out for ageneration or two.  But it is also  the doom of that Finnish dream of a &apos; Fennoskandia,&apos;&apos;which should be something more than a  mere geographical conception. - FinlailchsSwedish culture was the  last  band which  bound SuomFs land to the North, and now that, too, has been  cut &quot; (and see, e.g., Reports Nos. 72, 75, and 77).     Constitution. The session of the Lantdag ended on July 18th.  A  resolution was passed authorising the Finnish Government to  form and maintain, such  a military force as was required for the defence of the country.  The Speaker of  the Lantdagannounced  that the question  of  constitutional reform would be deferred till August,when  the  Lantdag of, 1918 would meet.  The Prime Minister, Paasikivi, has againinformed the delegation of Lantdag  parties that the Finnish Government will resignunless a Monarchical Constitution is shortly adopted.   At  the second reading in the diet, the  Monarchy Bill was  accepted by 57 votes against  52.  The  Foreign Officelearns that  the Kaiser  has informed  the Finnish Government that he does  not desireany of his sons to accept the Finnish throne.  The German  Government is neverthelesspressing for the establishment of a monarchy.     Obligatory Service Bill. The Finnish News Bureau  announces that  the FinnishLantdag has passed the second reading of a Bill for obligatory service  for civilians.of  both sexes  between the ages of  18  and  56,  to  perform work connected with, agriculture or the defence of the  country.     Question of Arrest  of Allied  Subjects on   Finnish Territory. The ForeignOffice is inviting the  views of  the  French  and  United  States Governments uponthe  reply of the German Government, as transmitted through the Finnish Govern- &quot;Government, regarding the return of Allied subjects arrested by German forces on Finnish.
territory.   (See Reports Nos. 60, 62, 63 and  77.)  His Majesty&apos;s Government is not disposed to regard the  German  Government as entitled to prescribe  the conditionstherein contained,  and proposes  to insist  upon  the  responsibility oi  the  finnish government in the matter.                                 HONDURAS.    Reported  Declaration  of  War  with Germany. Mr.  Young reports that HisMajesty&apos;s Acting Consul at Tegucicalpa informs him that  the  Republic of Hondurasdeclared war on Germany on July 19th.  Official notification has, however,  not  jetbeen received by Mr. Young.                               NETHERLANDS.    Dutch Negotiations with Belligerents. Sir AY. Townley reports that  in  reply toan enquiry as. to why the discussions  for a general  agreement with  the Allies wrasnot being followed  up, the Netherlands Foreign Minister contends  that  the  firstset of negotiations was concluded by the requisition of the ships.  This reply, which comes after a delay of seven months, does not (as  stated  in the Dutch  Press ofJuly 21st) contain any counter proposals and stultifies  practically all  the work doneby the Dutch delegates in London.  Sir W.  Townley notes that feeling in regard tothe requisition continues to be very bitter, and that there is still  considerable ignoranceamong the public regarding the Allied conduct of the matter.   The  Germans  aretaking advantage of  the Allied  requisition  (see  Reports  Nos.  59-62  and  71)to demand that  the  Dutch  shall   limit  the   tonnage in  future   employed  in anglo-Dutch trade to 10,000 tons, i.e.,  10 ships of  1,000  tons each.    In their negotiations regarding the supply of shipbuilding material to Holland, the germans are apparently  prepared  to  supply  any  quantity,  provided they  gain  by  the bargain.   Thus  they  would  allow  half to be free for Dutch  purposes conditionallyupon, e.g., the  export  of  certain agricultural products to Germany ;  or  they would permit the utilisation  of  one-third for Dutch against two-thirds for German require-ments.  These  advantages the  Dutch  are  unwilling to concede ; neither  are  theyanxious to agree  that the employment of  German, material  in the construction of dutch ships shall entitle Germany to  claim the first  use of such  ships for  a certainperiod after the war.  A. large number of Dutch vessels  under construction for dutch and neutral account cannot be completed  owing to this policy of the Germans.  TheDutch are anxious to  free these ships for  new construction and  would  be glad ofBritish material for that purpose ;  half of any material so supplied would  be reservedexclusively for Dutch use, but it is suggested that facilities would be  given for thepost-war employment by His  Majesty&apos;s Government of vessels  completed with Britishmaterials.  Dutch ships  might perhaps  be provided  to -fetch  the materials from england.   The new German Prize-Court Regulations  (see Reports Nos. 67, 68 and 70)are operating to prevent the Dutch lifting supplies  from England, and  Germany isusing her superior situation as  regards   transport  for the  purpose of  extortingfrom  the  Dutch  even  such commodities  (e.g.,  hides and fats)   as  they  areprecluded  by the agreement from  supplying.   In  return,  Germany can furnishgas-coal   and   iron,  both  of  which are of  vital  interest  to  Holland.   Thepresent Dutch  Cabinet is  thought  to consider  iron and  coal   of . more import-ance  to  Holland  than any  agreement with the  Allies.   At  the same  time  theForeign Minister hesitates to conclude an  agreement  with  either  side,  as  he fearscomplications wdth the third party in  each  case.   The fact that he will presently go out of office is a further cause of hesitation.  Meanwhile the Germans are protractingtheir  own negotiations, relying  on the cold weather  to compel acceptance of their terms.  (See cdso Reports Nos. 70-72, 74, 75 and 77.)    Projected Factories for  Artificial  Nitrates.

Prospective Visit of the King of Norway to Stockholm.: The Norwegian papersof July 20th announce that the King of Norway intends  to  return  the visit of theKing of Sweden at Stockholm in September.     Elections. The election campaign is now in full  swing.   The most  importantdevelopment has been the  decision  of the Agrarian Union  to  support the Right,which is  a blow to  the existing Government.   The  Government Press is trying tofrighten the electors from voting for the Social Democrats by articles on th&quot;e Bolshevistperil.  The parties of the Right  adopted  the following programme at  their generalmeeting on the  21st June: (1)  The maintenance of neutrality in  co-operation withthe rest of the Northern nations ;  (2) assistance for agriculture by loans ; (3) develop-ment of communications, fisheries, housing facilities, and electric power ; (4) economy in finance ;  (5) electoral reform and introduction of the  referendum ; (6) maintenanceof the country&apos;s defences.  The election programmes of both the great parties  showthat the old party lines are  breaking down, owing to the forces of  Socialism and thewar.  (And see Report No. 77.)

According to  a report received, afactoiw for the manufacture  of graphite crucibles is about  to.be  built  by  the BamleNickel Company.                                     SPAIN.     Adjournment of Parliament. The Press reports that on July 19th  the  Premierread before both Chambers  the decree for the  adjournment  of  Parliament for the summer recess.     German Complaints of Spanish Attitude. In a despatch dated July 9th Sir A.Hardinge  reports that  complaints had shortly before  that date been made  by theGerman Government in regard to the decreasingly friendly attitude of  Spain towards germany  and her Allies, of which indications were stated to be continually occurring.The agreements recently concluded by Spain with France and the United States were described as unfriendly to  Germany and of real  assistance to her  enemies.  the credits.opened to the French  were nothing less  than a disguised loan of doubtfulneutrality, the more especially as, according to the German Government, their amountgreatly exceeded the value of French purchases in the  country.  Moreover, facilitiesfor railway transport to France had  been granted,  and these also were  consideredunfriendly to Germany.  Further, complaint was made of the increasingly hostile toneof the Spanish Press.     The Espionage Bill. The Daily Review (N.P.S.) of July 19th reports the  text ofthe Espionage Bill, the debate thereon, and Press comment regarding (a) the tendency of the Bill (as apparently favouring German iuterests) ;  (b) the probable effect on theGovernment of the  withdrawal  of  the Opposition  from the  Chamber.   (See alsoReports Nos. 76 and 77.)     Resignation of Minister of  Marine. Sir A.  Hardinge reports that the SpanishMinister of  Marine resigned on July 20th on account of &apos; differences with the Premierregarding the application of the recent Military Reforms Law to the Navy.  His placewdll  probably be taken by  General Miranda.  The change is  not likely.to affect theposition of the Cabinet.     Reported German.   Violation  of  Spanish Territorial Waters. According  to  areport received by the Admiralty,  a French  steamer has recently  been sunk in
Spanish territorial waters by an  enemy  submarine, which subsequently endeavoured to conceal its action by ramming two boats containing the survivors.   (And see under&quot;Switzerland.&quot;)    German  and  Austrian  Exchange. Reports  received  indicate that  the  sale  ofGerman marks and Austrian kronen in Spain has lately become difficult.                                   SWEDEN.     The Swedish Allied Agreement. A memorandum  (G.T. 5154, dated July 17th, 191S) quotes the opinion expressed by a correspondent in the Frankfurter Zeitung of June 27th that the position of the Liberal Social-Democratic Ministry in Sweden is strengthened and that the present Government  is safer in the saddle now than it was. This he ascribes, first, to an ever-increasing  growth of  the Socialist movement, as shown by the results of the recent elections (see Report No. 71) ; and secondly to the food question.  In referring to the  agreement  between the Eden  Ministry  and the British Government (see Reports Nos. 71-73), the correspondent makes the criticism that the official Stockholm communique gives exact  details  of what  is required from Sweden, &quot; but as regards England the only prospect held  forth  is  that the import of 200,000 tons of essential food  -will  be  -facilitated.&quot;  He  goes on  to  say that as the fortunes of the present Government depend on the  supphy of foodstuffs from England, the latter can now take with both hands and give with  the little  finger only.   This impression, he says, is  ATery much  strengthened  by rumours  to the effect that the agreement contains  certain secret conditions in which Sweden promises  England  no longer to export certain goods to Germany, and that the  Entente has clone far  better business than Sweden.  Sir E. Howard learns  that the  German Government having been informed, that  Swedish exports to  Germany  are  restricted under the Swedish Agreement with the Associated Powers,  has expressed its intention  of taking measures to protect its interests ;  though the  measures contemplated are not known, they might, in the  opinion of the Swedish Foreign  Minister, take the form  of  the restriction of imports to Sweden.    British Bunkers for Swedish Vessels. The Foreign Office instructs Sir E. Howard that vessels under the control of the  Shipowners&apos;  Committee may be  supplied with bunkers in Sweden, unless trading  to Germany or in the interests of  firms on the Statutory  List.  Bunkers  should also be supplied in Norway to any Swedish vessel delivered, in  that  country on  time  charter to  His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Agreement.    Bolshevist  Representation.   Sir E.  Howard  reports that  M.  Vorovski,  the Bolshevist representative  at  Stockholm, has retired, the  reason being (according to Social Democraten) that he ordered  large quantities of agricultural machinery from Swedish   firms for  the  Bolshevist Government,  which orders   that Government subsequently disavowed.   It is stated that his successor,.M. Spiro, has already  arrived, and that he is not very hopeful regarding the prospects of Bolshevism.   A telegramfrom the Berlin representatives of  the Petrograd  Telegram Bureau, however,  statesthat the absence of M. Vorovski from Stockholm is only  temporary and  due to thefact that he is acting as Chairman of the Russo-Finnish Commission.  The Swedish papers of duly 23rd state  that M; Tore  Maximillanowitz Stromberg, who is  said tohave been  Bolshevist Minister for  War  in Siberia,  has arrived in Stockholm fromRussia as Military Attache at the Bolshevist. Legation.    Import of Oil  from.  Austria. The Swedish  papers report  that  300  tons  ofpetroleum  and lubricating  oil purchased from Austria by the Swedish IndustrialCommission arrived in Trelleborg on July 1 7th.                                SWITZERLAND.    Export of Embroideries. Sir H. Rumbold  enquires  whether, in the event of swiss embroideries  being prohibited for import into the United Kingdom (see ReportNo. 70); facilities  could  be afforded for their transit  via the United Kingdom to holland and Scandinavia,   Such a concession would be well received in Switzerland,and contribute towards the post-war exclusion of German embroideries on. the market.The tonnage involved would be inconsiderable.
     Carriage of Parcels for Prisoners of War. Sir H. Rum bold requests instructionsregarding a decision by the Swiss Government that parcels for prisoners of war cannot longer be  carried free of  charge by the  Swiss Railways.  It is  argued that theprovision of such  parcels constitutes an  effort  to supplement  the  insufficient foodsupplied by the capturing State so that the case falls  under Article VII. of the regu-lations  annexed to  the Hague  Convention, and not under Article  NA7!., paragraph 2thereof, which deals with the free  passage by  the State Railways of gifts for prisonersof war.  The  Swiss Government proposes, as from August  1st, to charge half-freight rates in respect of food sent  to prisoners of  war  camps from or  in  transit  throughSwitzerland.     Projected Acquisition of Enemy Ships in Spanish Waters. - Sir A. Hardinge reportsthat the Spanish Government has  agreed to place under the Spanish flag enemy shipseither purchased or chartered on behalf of the Swiss Government, provided that theofficers and the majority of the crew are Spanish.   The Swiss negotiator is  anxious that His Majesty&apos;s  Government will consent to the alteration of the contracts with the owners into charter-parties&apos;for the duration of the war.   The Austrian Governmenthas now refused to sell or charter the Austrian vessels in Spanish ports, but  offers tonegotiate regarding those in the Dutch East Indies.   (See also Reports Nos. 72  and 77).PEACE DISCUSSIONS.     France. Mr. Grahame reports (July 1.5th) that the following  resolution waspassed by a large majority at the Confederal Labour Congress :      &quot; The  19th-National Corporative. Congress recalls the nature of the statutes of the confederation Generafe du Travail, which guarantees to all tendencies of the move-ment their freedom of expression within the union of labour.  It cannot, however,tolerate that regularly confederated organisations should be deprived  of the manage-meht of the  corporative  movements which may be started, in  their midst.  Talcingnote of the declarations made on its platform hi the  name of these tendencies ; justlyappreciating the efforts made on both sides to dissipate the  ambiguities which  haveconfused their respective  standpoints and to  liberate from the.past the action of thelabour class for the  future; estimating that  the debates  have  proved the solicitudefor labour  interests  and  the  peace of  the world which has exclusively inspired theattitude of the syndical organisations and of  the Confederation Generate du Travailwhich is their national expression.     &quot; It declares its confidence in the militants and in the  regular organisations.     &quot;It ratifies the resolution of action and unity voted at the Conference of ClermontFerrand which&apos; condemns the continuation of secret  diplomacy ; which disapprovestreaties made  without  the Jmowledge of the nation; which demands  that the nationbe made acquainted with  the  conditions on which a general, just and lasting peace,the only one possible,  can be concluded ;  the  conditions of wdiich can  be  summed  upas  follows : No annexations ;  the  right of  peoples  to dispose  of themselves  ; there-establishment  of  the independence  and territorial integrity of the countries nowoccupied ; the reparation of losses ; no war indemnities ;  no economic war after the cessation of hostilities ; the freedom of straits and seas ; the institution of obligatoryarbitration to settle  international disputes ; the  constitution of the Society of Nations ;conditions which are those defined by President Wilson, by the  Russian revolution at its outset, and affirmed by all inter-allied and international manifestations  and  evenby Zimmerwald.     &quot;It reminds the working classes that the grant of passports already demanded by the Clermont Ferrand Conference for  an International Conference depends largely onon their powerful and disciplined action in support of that given by their mandate tothe Confederation  Generale du Travail to conduct with all its force,  by all themeans in  its power with a  view  to imposing on two Governments by a  general demonstration if necessary the expressed will of the proletariat.     &quot; It declares its disapproval of all armed - intervention by  the Entente in Russiaindependent of the will of the Russian people itself.
     &quot;It invites finally all the working-class organisations to act with the fixed purposeof imposing upon all the recognition of the rights of labour.&quot;     Belgium. (See under &quot; Belgium &quot; on page 3.)     Germany. Information  has reached the  Foreign Office from a reliable source(July 15th) indicating that the  Germans seem to  realise the fact that in all peacediscussions the full restoration of Belgium  must  be the  first condition of peace, andthat they may be contemplating a declaration satisfactory to the Entente on this point,but are anxious first to judge what effect such a declaration would produce upon other problems, and upon the continuation of the war.     On July 23rd Sir W. Townley called attention  to an article in the NordcleubsclieAllgemeine Zeitung, endeavouring to answer  the  points in Mr. BalfouFs  recent replyto Count Herding.     Bulgaria. According to information received from Sir H. Rumbold (July 19th)intrigues  by doubtful agents seem to be in  progress  in  order, if possible,  to  bring&quot;about a local peace in the Balkans.   This apparently does not imply any detachment of Bulgaria from her  alliance.     Finland. Sir E. Howard reports (July 23rd) that, according to Press information,the forthcoming peace negotiations  between Finland  and Russia will take place  inBerlin, in accordance with the wishes of the  Russians.     Holland. German Wireless of July 22nd gave great prominence to the  activitiesof Mr. Troelstra,  quoting at length an open letter addressed to Mr. Henderson on thesubject of war aims.   The tendency of the letter  is  to discourage the  Allies  from making renewed military steps to bring about  a lasting peace.  (The Daily Review ofthe  Foreign Press of July 20th calls attention to  another German Wireless report(July 18th) making capital out  of an  article in the Manchester  Guardian criticisingthe  action of the Government in refusing a passport to Mr. Troelstra,  who appears  tobe receiving support in the Vorwarts.)  According to  a report  from Sir  W. Townley(July 21st) Mr. llroelstra is about to  visit  Switzerland, with a view to the  reorganisation -sation of  the International, and to arrange, if  possible, a meeting between  Socialistsrepresenting the belligerent countries of both sides.
