CABINET.                         i ) C.P. 4249.                                                       A                    SCOTTISH NATIONAL WAR MEMORIAL.                /1           Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary  for Scotland.       I refer to cry Memorandum CP.  448  of the  13th  January,  1920, on the subject of the Scottish National  War Memorial and  to  the conclusions of the Cabinet  meeting held  on the  21st  January,  1920. The Cabinet then decided &quot;that as  there  was Some  division of&quot;opinion in Scotland upon&quot; the  scheme they could not  express  any&quot;view by way of approval or  otherwise in  regard  to it.   They  were&quot;willing, however, that an appeal should  be made as suggested,  on&quot;the understanding that if its  success  were such as to  indicate a&quot;general measure of approval, the Government would offer no objec-&quot;tion to the carrying out of the scheme under  Government supervision,&quot;but without any promise of  a Government  grant.&quot;  I have now  been confidentially informed by  the Duke  of Atho11 that sufficient subscriptions for the purpose  of the&apos;essential  part  of the Memorial (the Shrine with Side Galleries)  have  been  received,  - a sum of  50,000, of which the donor wishes to  remain  as yet anonymous, having recently  been given.  The result of  the appeal indicates that the scheme has  a general  measure of approval  from the public in spite of the  opposition  which has been manifested by Lord Rosebery and a limited body of  critics.  In  the circumstances I think that the carrying out  of the scheme under Government supervision may now be regarded as approved by  the Cabinet in principle.      The Duke of Athcll proposes to  communicate with the  Office of Works, the Architect (Sir Robert Lorimer) and others concerned with a view to measures necessary for carrying out the work.      Before definite action is taken a further  Memorandum will be submitted to the Cabinet.                             (Sgd.)  ROBERT MUNRO.  .Irtish Office,  Whitehall,  S.W. 1.      30th September, 1922.
