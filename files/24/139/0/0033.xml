[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1922.SECRET.CP. 4233.(In continuation of CP. 4178.)                                 CABINET.                 IRAQ  TREATY.(Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.)                                     (88.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for  the Colonies to  the High Commissioner                                   for Iraq.(No. 511.  Personal and Secret.)                            September 7, 1922.    Your No. 620 of 4th September.  I am very glad to know that column is safe,though the unsuccessful skirmish is an unpleasant incident.    I approve your action in collecting the Government officials from the SulemaniyehProvince, which operation shows the usefulness of the aeroplane.  I am treating this in the communique not as an evacuation, but as a temporary concentration of our officials  for their  safety.  It is  certainly not  necessary to announce any decision to evacuate or give up the Sulemaniyeh Province.  We hold ourselves perfectly free tore-enter it at any convenient moment.  Let us, however, see where we  stand withFeisal and in Baghdad before we expose ourselves to risks of any kind in Kurdistan.    Secondly, I congratulate you upon the success  of your action in Baghdad.   I accept the modifications which you propose  in my No. 503 and you may now proceedto bring the whole issue before Feisal.  I will wait to hear the result of your discus-sion with him before asking for any decision from the Cabinet. If he complains about our temporary withdrawal from  Sulemaniyeh, you  might tell him that one of  thereasons  which prevented strong  action being taken  against the  raiders was  the trouble that he himself and his  extremists were making in the capital. CHURCHILL.                                     (89.)Telegram  from the High Commissioner for Iraq  to the  Secretary of State for                                 the Colonies.(Secret and Personal.)                                      September 9, 1922.    Your  telegram No. 504 of 2nd September is partly answered by my telegram of 4th September, No. 615.  It is not understood how your figure of 30 lakhs is arrivedat.  Ministry of Finance calculate that if the amount provided by Iraq for railways in 1921-22 be set off against drawings by Iraq on His Majesty&apos;s Government the netoverdraft  is about 11 lakhs, and for this Iraq admits  liability and fully realisesobligation to pay when funds available.    Recommendations of Economies  Committee make considerable reductions in allheads of expenditure, including army and Court, but only recommendations approvedby King up to the present effect reduction in pay of army and of local officials, and reduction  in ration allowance for non-locals.   Financial situation was known  toFeisal before his illness, but he hardly realised seriousness of it.  I will impress it on him at my coming interview.  Revised estimate of current year revenue, 532 lakhs;expenditure,  566  lakhs;  are based  on  assumption  that  recommendations  of economies Committee come into effect.    Divisional advisers express opinion that  recent action will have very stimulatingeffect on payment of land revenue on the Euphrates, so  that amount of deficit now estimated  under this head may be somewhat reduced during  course of year.    Am grateful for your expression of sympathy. Cox.[8914]
   Telegram from  the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for                                 the Colonies.(No. 643.)                                                September 10, 1922.    My telegram of 7th September, No. 627.    I had two hours&apos; interview with the King to-day.  Cornwallis was present andwe went over  the whole ground.  Feisal was amenable as regards essentials,  and onthe whole result was satisfactory.    1. As regards the necessity for him to endorse the action taken by me  during his illness.  In two different Renter messages received  during the past few  days ithas been stated that King Feisal was in agreement with the High Commissioner inregard  to the measures taken by the latter.   These  statements have  not beenchallenged, and I  hope are sufficient for your purpose.   On the other hand, Iraqifriends here, on whose opinion reliance can  be placed, have expressed the view thatthe demonstration of the fact that the British representative is authorised and pre-pared to take action himself in case of emergency has had a very comforting effecton the law-abiding elements, and that  it would be a pity to dispel it by any  specialannouncement here.  All we seem to want is something we can produce in case any action should be challenged.  Feisal was somewhat nettled at learning action takenin regard  to one or  two of his proteges, but agreed to write me a letter on linesdrafted by me thanking me in general terms  for effective measures taken to maintainlaw and  order in difficult situation  resulting  from his  sickness and  absence ofCabinet.   I will telegraph  as soon as this  reaches me. and I trust that it  will beconsidered to meet all requirements.    Secondly, as regards the reformation of the Cabinet.  After asking for and receiving assurance from me that it  was not our design to impose Naqib upon him as permanent Prime Minister, he agreed to invite him to form a new Cabinet  in con-sultation with himself and me, but he  stipulated that the reformation should await the announcement  of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, hoped for this week.I agreed, in view of considerations set forth  in the following paragraph.    Thirdly, regarding the Treaty  and Mandate,  he  replied that, supposing he:understood aright  the portent of the proposals you were prepared to put  before theCabinet (vide your telegram No. 492), he would regard such a solution as most satis-factory, particularly bearing which you attach to Article 6.    If His Majesty&apos;s Government will publish Treaty  accompanied by  announce-ment indicated by  you, he will follow it immediately by an announcement by himself to people of Iraq,  saying that he accepts the Treaty on this basis, thanking GreatBritain for her liberal policy and calling upon  his people to work unitedly  and inclose association with us for the successful execution thereof.  Fie will then authoriseNaqib to sign the Treaty and call upon him to form a Cabinet to carry out the policyindicated therein,  which he himself will support whole-heartedly.    Fourthly, as regards the question of his adherence to constitutional methods and abstention, from  interference in administrative  details and appointments, he sought to justify his past attitude by the argument that as yet there was no  Consti-tution  and that Cabinet was not a  real Government, but  a  scratch assortment of individuals without any settled policy and disinclined to take responsibility.  OnceTreaty was signed, Constituent Assembly formed and Organic Law framed,  he was quite prepared to  accept position of a  limited and constitutional monarch, but untilthen it was very difficult to  apply hard-and-fast principles.    The only matter in regard to which he firmly resisted was the proposal thatthe Government should nominate his  Chief Secretary  and Chamberlain.  He con-tended that, in the first place, proposal was  an obvious indication of mistrust on thepart of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and if they did not  trust him he did not wish toremain.  I explained that the proposal had  come from me and was made in his own interests, but he continued that it would be unbearable that in such a personal matterhe should be dependent on the will of &amp;nj Cabinet that happened to be in power.  he added that he recognised his personal entourage was at present  very  crude.  Individuals had  been appointed experimentally or  on hand-to-mouth  principles.  Assoon as the situation was  cleared up  he was ready to  reorganise it, but he couldunder no circumstances agree that Cabinet  should have any say in regard to theseappointments.    I  should mention  that, in reply  to my  argument  as  to inexpediency  of hisinterfering in regard to appointments and business of the Ministry of the Interior,
he replied that he had only interfered with good motives, and that, if we had onlylet him interfere in Kurdistan, affairs would never have reached their present pass.    Finally, he reiterated that he did not wish us to be under any misapprehensionin regard to his aspirations.   He was convinced that the only safe policy to pursuewas the creation of a really free and independent State  with the intimate  association and friendly assistance of  Great Britain.  If Great Britain desired in any way toplay the severe Mandatory Power, he was convinced that such a policy was doomed tofailure, and he could not be a party to it.  He repeated, however, that the basis indicated in your telegram No. 492 would satisfy him completely and that he would work it with enthusiasm.    I  trust that you will consider the  foregoing as affording sufficient  grounds to warrant His Majesty&apos;s Government in giving Feisal another lease of life on the lines contemplated.  I  will confirm the terms of his letter of thanks as soon as it reachesme.  In drafting the foregoing I have not thought it necessary to quote the counter-arguments  advanced by Cornwallis and myself, but trust that you will take themfor granted. Cox.                                     (9F)Telegram  from  the  High  Commissioner  for  Iraq to the Secretary of State for                                 the Colonies.(No. 646.)                                                September 11, 1922.    My telegram of  10th  September, No.  643.   Have  duly received  letter  fromFeisal in terms of my draft. Cox.                                     (92.)Telegram, from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High  Commissioner                                   for Iraq.(No. 524. Personal and Secret.)     &apos;                      September 14, 1922.    Your No. 643 of 10th September.    Your One. If you are content, I am.    Second.   Feisal proposes to make the formation of a Ministry contingent upon our agreeing to the Treaty settlement as now defined.  This was not at all what wemeant.   The King has no right to continue ruling without a  responsible Ministry,nor ought we to settle the grave questions connected with the Treaty personally withhim.  We must settle them with him duly advised by his Ministers in a constitutionalfashion.   This is fundamental.   Moreover, he must  be guided generally by youradvice in the choosing of his Ministers in the period intervening before Iraq obtainsmembership of the League  of Nations not  merely on this occasion or in regardparticularly to the Naqib.  I am of opinion that he should summon the Naqib to forma Ministry forthwith without any question of obtaining declarations or signaturesfrom the Naqib in regard to the Treaty, and that the  new Cabinet should consider these questions when they are formed.  I think you should  advise him in this sense.At. present he is ruling without a  Ministry,  and he is  in no position to do business with  us   on  grave matters.  Let him summon the Naqib to form a Ministry inaccordance  with  your  advice.  That is the essential preliminary to any decisivearrangements between His Majesty&apos;s  Government and Iraq.    Furthermore, it isessential that the King should understand that he  must be guided in a general senseby your advice in the dismissal or appointment of Ministers in the future.    With regard to his Chief Secretary and Chamberlain,  I  am prepared to deferto his wishes in this respect provided it is understood that he chooses persons who arenot obnoxious to you.    You do not mention having  spoken to Feisal on the financial aspect resultingfrom his bad appointments.  I presume you  think it desirable not to complicate themain issue by this matter at this time.  If so, I concur.    Part II.  As soon as you have succeeded in obtaining satisfactory response fromFeisal, and  as soon as the Naqib and his Cabinet are  installed in power,  I  shall be quite ready, provided the King and Cabinet are  in agreement on the course to be pursued, to submit to the Cabinet the proposals  for the Treaty settlement as nowdefined between us.  I must be able to assure the Cabinet that Feisal has come into line,, and that he  is supported by the Naqib and  his Cabinet, and in adopting the       [8914]                                                         B  2
Treat)- settlement as defined they will be taking a course which will secure immediate and responsible support in Iraq.    The next question is whether we should settle and sign the Treaty with Feisaland the new Cabinet or whether Feisal and the new Cabinet should declare themselvesin favour of it, put it to the Constituent Assembly when it is formed, and both workenthusiastically for its passage through that body. Surely there is a great deal to besaid for this second course, which would also give time for the important subsidiaryagreements-military, financial and judicial to take shape.   Are you sure Feisalhas not some trap in mind in proposing to saddle the whole responsibility upon theNaqib ?  Have you any reason to suppose that the Naqib would accept the burden ?    All the matters dealt with in the second part of my telegram must, however,follow and  not accompany the submission of Feisal as above described  and theconstitution  of  a responsible Ministry and  the. appointment of  the Naqib.-CHURCHILL.                                     (93.)     Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State                             for the Colonies.(No. 654.)                                                 September 17, 1922.     Your telegram of 14th September, No. 524.     As regards one.  As between Feisal  and myself, it is agreed that it is at ourdiscretion to publish the letter if and when we please.     With regard to  two.   Feisal will not make much difficulty on this point.  Thedifficulty will be for the Naqib and the individuals whom he invites to join him,who in the  absence of declaration from us will not know on what lines of policy they are expected to work.  I shall have to explain to each general lines which I hopewill be laid down, and ensure that they are generally in accord.   Anyhow, I will endeavour to arrange on the lines you wish.     Financial  result of his  bad appointments was fully, explained to him, andsubject was  meant to be [ ? included in] first and last sentences of my telegram.     As regards Treaty.   It is urgent that it should be signed at once from all points of view, and has been rendered more so  by Turkish successes.   We should get theTreaty signed  as soon as possible and set to work on the subsicliarjr agreements.That will set people at  rest for the time being, and give us all something to workupon.   Any prolongation of the suspense regarding the Treaty or the Mandate willbe most dangerous with  the  European situation and the attitude of the Turks asuncertain as it  is.     My interview with Feisal on your telegram  No. 524 has been delayed by Zaid&apos;arrival, hut will probably take place on the 18th. Cox.                                     (94.)     Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State                                for the Colonies.(No. 655.)                                                 September 18, 1922.     Trust that you will give  me immediate information of any developments in theTurkish situation or negotiations connected therewith which give any indication ofEemahs real attitude with regard to Iraq. Cox.                                     (95.)     Telegram from, the High Commissioner for Iraq to  the Secretary of State                                for the Colonies.(No. 661)                                                 September 18, 1922.     My telegram No. 654.     Had interview with Feisal evening of 18th September.   He agrees to call onNaqib to form &quot;Cabinet at once.   In order that he and I may be assured that each individual  prima facie selected accepts policy and is prepared to work on it andfor it, I am writing to him a personal and informal letter stating what you requirefrom himself and the new Cabinet in order to justify you in making to  the british cabinet recommendations which you expressed your personal readiness  to make in
your telegram No. 492.  This letter will be shown personally to each aspirant,  andhe will be  required  to give assurance of his whole-hearted acceptance before hisnomination is approved.    He readily gave undertaking to  consult High Commissioner in regard to theappointment arid  dismissal of Ministers both pending  admission  of  Iraq to theLeague of Nations and thereafter. Cox.                                     (96.)Telegram from the High  Commissioner for Iraq to the  Secretary of State for the                                   Colonies.(No. 662.)                                                 September 18, 1922.    At interview referred to in my immediately preceding telegram the stirring news from Smyrna and Constantinople was necessarily touched upon. Feisal begged tobe kept in our confidence as regards developments of the situation and possibility ofthe Turks undertaking movement against Iraq (public here thinks that if a state ofwar were declared between Great Britain and Turkey over the Dardanelles question,Mbstapha Kemal  would at once move against Iraq).  A propos of this possibilityFeisal  said that Great Britain must  inform the Government of Iraq in what way they could best co-operate with Great Britain in resisting Turks.  His own view wasthat all available men of Iraq local forces should be concentrated in Mosul.    It seems to  me that as soon as the Treaty is signed we should take advantageof the  present situation to let them  introduce conscription.  National instinct ofself-preservation  would make it possible and would itself be stimulated thereby,and doubts regarding our intentions removed, while, at the same time, our financial difficulties would be  eased. Do you primd facie concur&apos;? Cox.                                     (97.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies  to the High  Commissioner                                   for Iraq.(Personal and Most Secret.)                                September 19, 1922.    Your No. 654.  I congratulate you on the results you have achieved, and I willgladly make  the recommendations to the British Cabinet as  soon as you assure methat the  Naqib &apos;s Government is complete on the basis indicated.    2. There are good chances that the firm attitude adopted by the British Empirewill lead the Kemalists to refrain from attacking our troops  in the neutral zone.I will not fail to keep you informed as soon as any change in the situation affectingyour interests appears probable.  I shall ask for a Cabinet at the end of the week on the Treaty.  If the Treaty were signed it would be very difficult for us to interferewith the Iraq Governments wish for conscription in view of  the dangerous position on the frontier. CHURCHILL.                                     (98.)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq  to the Secretary of State  for the                                   Colonies.(No. 678.)                                                 September 25, 1922.    My telegram of 18th September, No. 661.     Some little time has been occupied in composing divergent views of Feisal andNaqib in regard to selection of one or two individuals for Ministries, but tripartite agreement has been reached, and it only  remains to obtain assurance  in each of acceptance of policy.   It is  expected that this will be done, and announcement offormation of Cabinet made on 26th or 27th.  We shall  then only await intimationfrom you of acceptance by British Cabinet of  your recommendations.     I suggest following change of tactics in sequence of events, namely, that before you give anything  for publication you should telegraph me clear the line, firstly, that cabinet  have accepted your  recommendations, and, secondly, text of  announcementproposed.  Immediately on receipt the Naquib and I would sign  Treaty.  Then thepublic communique would take form  of  terms of the Treaty as just  signed, andtogether with announcement from His Majesty&apos;s Government which coincided withsignature.  The object is to make the announcement a fait accompli,  not open to discussion except,  of  course, in due  course by  Constituent  Assembly.  Do  youconcur ? Cox.
