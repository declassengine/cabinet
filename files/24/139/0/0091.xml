Contingents  of unemployed  from  Northern towns have started to march to London:   the number of marchers is,  so far,  small.      On October 24th about  1,500 unemployed  from Stepney, Canning Town, ley tons tone and Bethnal  Green  caused obstruction outside the Stepney Insitution  end were dispersed  by  the police,  some  of whom were forced to  use their truncheons; an empty Mills  bomb was thrown  from  the front of the  crowdwhich showed  determined defiance of  the police.      Communist  activity is  concentrated In the Municipal end Parliamentary Elections:  In accordance  with the &quot; United Prontn policy,  communists,  while declaring their own political faith, will support the  Labour Party  whenpossible.      Headquarters are  still setting  up machinery on the linesof the  Commission report, but branches  show  little enthusiasm as yet.      There are  indications that  the  Communist  Internationalintends  to exercise  closer control of  the Communist party of Greet Britain.      It  is reported  that large numbers  of miners in theSouth Wales coalfield have declined  to  hand  in notices onthe non-unionist question.
THE GOMMTJglSTS  :        &apos; :&quot;*&quot;  -&quot;     :&quot; &apos;          Further light is thrown upon the finances of the     Communist&apos; Party of Great Britain by a letter recently : ;  -  sent by Hertha Sturm,  of the Women&apos;&apos;a Secretariat of the    -Communist Internationajl  to Helen-Crawfurd,  who has    I     complained of lack of money for the -women&apos;a movement     in this country,               &quot;We got your letter and  report from September          13th and discussed  the affairs Of the  female          propaganda by the Communist Party of Great Britain          with Comrade Clara Zetkin.  She was astonished you          had so much financial difficulties hindering you ;          to fulfil your task as you wish to do.  By the          representative of your party  in Mosoow Comrade          Clara was informed  that your  party afforded          considerable sisns f(9r the female propaganda.          Comrade geiucin who  has conferred with  the. Executive         Vof the Comintern  ahout the financial resources of&apos;          your party has been assured your party was rather    .;  -  &quot;  well furnished so that it might be able to give  \          financial assistance to your  work which she deems          of great importance.&quot;&apos;:;.       .   The Executive of  the; Cosfomunist Party has had under     consideration the formation of an  underground organisation,     as  the  members are of  opinion that sooner or later the    - party will  become illegal:  delegates to Moscow have   &apos;:- been instructed to bring the matter forward at the   &quot;Fourth  Congress as the British Party is-,; as yet,   &quot;inexperienced in work  of an illegal nature.          Gallacher has reported that there is &quot;quite  a rush     on&quot;  at  Sing Street owing to the political situation and   .    the Executive is working overtime  in consequence.  The;    Party is making a determined and probably an embarrassing    effort to identify itself with- the Labour Party at the    General  Election.  In  the  current  issue of  &quot;The    Communist Review&quot;,  which is edited by William Paul,  are    certain  passages which are of interest in this connection:    in t-ho  &quot;Review of the Month&quot;,  which is probably written    by Paul,  it  is  stated that:                                                      &quot;It/
* s          &quot;It is difficult to comprehend the xeasoiis why     the Labour Party has not. issued an official     programme, to place&apos;before the country, which it     intends to put&quot; into opo rat ion when it assumes     parliamentary control.  Henderson and Webb are       4$     depending Upon winning at the next election, not upon&apos;    . what they intend to accomplish, but upon what the     Lloyd George regime has failed to do.  They are     hoping to. get votes not because of their virtues, but I     because of the vices of the present government.       j     Above all, they are slow *o formulate a definite     policy because they.are afraid of splitting the party     and of exposing the impotenoy of &amp; parliamentary     government as an organ of real social reconstruction.     The Labour Party can be held together so long as its     policy is vague and nebulous;  the moment it oomes     down to any definite.and concrete line of action,  -   particularly upon any important problem, differences     :arise...&quot;    --The writer&quot;devotes two pQges to the minimum programmeoutlined by CP. Trevelyan end, dealing with the steps which a Labour fovernment might take in order to effect the nationalisation of mines and railways., declares that:          &quot;If it .me rely rushes a Bill through Parliament     nominally nationalising these industries nothing     sensational may happen.  But if it calls upon the     miners1 ;and railwaymen^ unions to set up new  ..... administrative organs by which alone these industries     can be successfully operated in a socialised manner,     the propertied interests will use every weapon, both     constitutional and unconstitutional,,!^ smash such a/     Labour Government,- In these new organs of sooial     administration the reactionaries will see, quite     correctly, the embryonic form of a new society     destined to replace the parliamentary system of     government with a new basis rooted in the industrial   -organisations of the masses.  Very speedily the Labour      Government will find turned against it, not only its- &apos;;: own timid renegades who will desert it, but the whole     organised might of the capitalist class operating    &apos; through every channel where it wields power.   Such     a.situation will demonstrate that real nationalisation     is not .a question of ballot box majorities but is one,     fundamentally, .of class power.&apos;.          &quot;If; the Labour Party is in earnest it will be-.  -   compelled to take up a determined stand against the     capitalist class.   In such a struggle it &quot;will have     the loyal assistance and co-operation of the Communist     Party using its influence&quot;fo stimulate the masses     against the capitalist reactionaries..^&apos;&quot;v.-.--   -As regards a General Labour nrogramme, the writerthinks that:  &apos;                           ...  ..-::    -:;     &quot;The ..chaos and misery of tp-day.-are-&apos;the symptomsI     that capitalism, has broken down&apos; and that its industrial                                                   and/
      and political machinery ,can no longer be operated to      satisfy modern social needs.  What is needed, then,      is not a re-ad justment of  that machinery hy a labour      Government.  The conditions arc demanding new economic      and political machinery, new class.relationships, new      social ties, a new form of Government, a new social      system - In a word, a social revolution.  The leaders      of the labour Party, like  Henderson and Webb, know      what is needed as well as  we do.  It is because they      know what  is needed, that they dare not face the task      of drawing up a detailed programme of social      reconstruction to be undertaken by a Labour Government;      They are between the devil and the deep sea.  If they  ;      draw up a  programme that would succeed and which would;      benefit the masses, they must outline a plan which      would be tantamount to a. declaration of war upon      capitalism and all its institutions.  They do not      want to commit themselves  to that;  besides, it would      mean a big split in the Labour party*  if they      draft a showy programme based upon social goodwill to      all classes, they know It  would be predestined to fail      and would  therefore drive  the disillusioned masses on      the road tOY/ards Communism...          &quot;The  Communist Party, in pledging itself to support      the Labour Party at the next General Election is      actuated by no other motive than the earnest desire to      help to create the historical conditions which will give      the Lahour Party its opportunity - either to face,      courageously, the enemies  of the working class and to      sweep over them to Socialism, or to retreat in cowardly      confusion  before the capitalists, and b:v so doing to      make way for those bolder  spirits who will not shrink  \      from challenging the propertied interests.  There are      several sectarian coteries on the extreme, outside,      Left who chant their formulas and swear that a Labour  -      Government must prove a ghastly failure..  For this      reason they refuse to touch the Labour party with a      20 yard pole,.  At the same time they are anxious for      the Labour Party to asstane governmental responsibility      in order that it may demonstrate Its own ineptitude.     Even where, such an attitude as this is taken up, it .      ought to be a duty to return the Labour party to power      in order to facilitate the historical conditions which     will concretely expose all the pretensions of pure and      simple parliamentary labourism.  The revolutionary  - ,   realist is one who actively participates in the     historical process in order to try and produce the     most favourable  conditions for him to demonstrate the *     wisdom of his policy and the folly of his opponents.&quot;Branch secretaries have been informed by special circularthat:          &quot;The  Executive Committee have had under     consideration the question of Municipal  Elections     and  within the next day or two a statement of policy     will be  issued  to help  branches in their looal work.          nIn the  meantime-,  it  should be noted  that     while  everything possible  should be done  to  develop     the  United  Front,  care  must always be  taken to keep                                                    the/
       the Party Policy in the forefront.   Any support,       therefore given to the Labour Party candidates       should &quot;ue given along with the announcement that       the support is coming from-a. communist or       communists as tha immediate method of carrying on       the class struggle.            &quot;Where Party Members are running as labour     ;  Party candidates, if it is not.possible to get     -  our programme accepted-, the member should at least      .in his election address and throughout tho     -campaign make known the fact that he is a member       of the Communist Party,n       She &quot;InternationalPress Correspondence&quot; has&quot;published a report of the recent Battersea Conference  of the  Communist Party of  Great. Britain in a special  supplement:  the report itself calls for no comment,  but was.written by Walter Stoecker,  the German delegate.  who made a dramatic appearance at the conference and  during  whose speech ho one was allowed to leave the  hal.1,    It was stated  at a recent branch meeting at  Coventry that an Italian delegate also attended the cohference and complained of the difficulty, of getting  into the conference a      Communist headquarters are considering the.possibility of demonstrations on Armistice Bay,  but  no definite  plans&apos;&apos;have  been made, as yeta  .  -The  Organising Bureau of the Communist Party is  to  consist of A.  lakpin,  H.

The West Riding will he  split  into two          distriots, West Yorks,  and  South Yorks,  so  that textile          interests  will  he kept  apart frOm Mining Interests and          confusion  will  be avoided.

The  question oa united  front was  raised, the  essence  of  which  was,how to  get the lead  of the masses  and free them  fromthe influence  of the Second  and  Two-anti-a-HalfInternationals in the  field  of  action.     &apos; &quot;A year has passed,  and we  should  take  stock  ofthe Communist movement. ..     &quot;The  consolidation of the  Communist Movement  hasand is  taking piece with  Increasing  force.
