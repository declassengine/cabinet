This document is the  property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  government^*ra&quot;&quot;&apos;SECRET.CP.  4251.THE CABINET.THE  TURKISH  ARMY.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR WAR.     I  circulate  a Note by  the  General Staff on the  situation and strength of the  Ql5^Turkish Army.           &apos;                                                           6127                                                                       L,  W.-E.  THE WAR office,         3rd October, 1922.                 THE  SITUATION OF THE  TURKISH ARMY.     1.  (a)  The 3rd Army has closed north-eastwards on  to the boundary of the Ismidneutral zone.     (&amp;) The 3rd Corps  has  moved  eastwards  from Panderma  towards the Brusa area,evidently with a view to joining the 1st Army.     (c) The 61st  Division, from the 6th .Corps at  Balikesri, has  moved  to Brusa,evidently joining the 3rd Corps, thus reducing the  6th Corps and increasing the 3rd Corpsby 3,000 rifles and 12 guns.     (d) The 2nd Corps has moved northwards  from Smyrna.     2.  From the above  it will be seen  that a  force  of  21,500 rifles  and sabres  and52 guns (not counting any captured Greek guns that may  have been added, to this force)is being definitely concentrated against the Ismid zone.     General Harington states  that &quot;in 9  days  Kemal  might produce a rifle strength of45-50,000  on the  Ismid front, though he would probably  keep a central reserve betweenthe Sea of Marmora  and Balikesri.&quot;   The  General Staff confirm this  opinion.   The 6thand 4th Corps, the location of  which has not been  verified since 21st and  18th September,respectively, may already be well  advanced on the road to Ismid, and if so this  wouldgive the numbers that General Harington mentions.     On the other  hand, the fact that the  positions  of  the  6th  and  4th Corps have remained unverified for so long makes it possible that elements of these corps are movingon Chanak ; but General Harington  does not  consider this to be the case.  As all our information of Turkish movements comes  to us at present from General  tleadquarters,Constantinople, General Harington has better opportunities of making  deductions from itthan we have.     3.  The war establishment  of a  Turkish division  gives  a  ration  strength  of 7,650and a rifle strength of 4,000, with 12 guns.  During the past, units have seldom, if ever,been up to  establishment.  At the  commencement  of  the recent offensive against the greeks, the  average rifle strength of a division was estimated at 3,000.   Since then it isbelieved that they have suffered something less  than  10,000  casualties and  it is known that  they had sufficient trained men in reserve formations  (estimated at 25,000)  to make this good.   We therefore assume an average rifle strength  of 3,000 to-day.  There  are,however, certain special divisions which are known to have certain smaller establishments ;this is taken into consideration in  arriving at the numbers given.(B22/255)  100 10/22  W.O.P.  387
