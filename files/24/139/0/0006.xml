                                      GENEVA.                                 15th September,  1922.Sir,      You are aware of the circumstances that  led tothe convocation of a European International.HealthConference in Warsaw in March of the present year,  andof the recommendations and resolutions adopted by that conference.  These recommendations were taken  intoconsideration by the Economic Conference at Genoa,  whichapproved both the principles of anti-epidemic  actionenunciated by the Warsaw Conference,, and the recommendation that the Epidemic Commission of the League of  Rations beentrusted with the duty of controlling and supervisingthe expenditure of such national subscriptions as mightbe contributed for the prosecution of the anti-epidemiccampaign.  The Governments represented&apos; at Genoa furtherundertook to approach their respective parliaments  forthe financial assistance necessary to give practical effect to the programme laid down by the expert Conferenceat Warsaw.      Up to the present no further subscriptions to the funds of the Epidemic Commission have been received,  asthe result of this recommendation made by the  GenoaConference.  The British Government, however,  have  obtainedparliamentary sanction to a further contribution to theEpidemic Commission of  100,000 provided that  other Govern-ments interested together contribute sums totalling 200,000.  The Czecho-Siovakian Government have promiseda contribution of one million crowns.                                                The:/
      The Council of like League of iiations at a recentsession considered that no useful purpose would be served by the issue of another general appeal to iiembers of theLeague, as the facts regarding the serious epiflidraio situationin eastern Europe were known to all.  The Council therefore considered that the responsibility for the carrying out orotherwise of the programme laid down by the InternationalHealth Conference at V.warsaw must rest with the individualGovernments,  ^t the same time, it was thought well thatall Delegations present at the Assembly should be acquainted with the conditions governing the British offer of assistancereferred to above, so that endeavours might be made beforethe close of the Assembly to obtain promises of contributionssufficient to enable immediate advantage to be taken of theBritish offer.     It is in compliance with this decision of the council that I now aadress you with the request that, if there beno objection, j?ou wij.1 kindly ascertain the extent of&quot;assistance that your government is disposed to give.  I need not here refer in detail to the continued gravity ofthe epidemic situation in the countries of eastern Europe,or to the urgsncy and magnitude of the task that waits tobe accomplished.  These matters have been dealt with fully in the reports of the ^warsaw Conference and of the EpidemicCommission, and in the various publications recently issuedby the Health section of the League of nations.  It will suffice if I point out that an indefinite continuance ofthe existing state of affairs will not only add anormoualyto the sum total of human misery and suffering, but willcontinue to be, sb it is at pre sent ^ one of the most-                                             formidable
formidable obstacles to economic recuperation and srtabdJLijfcyvin the countries concerned.  I would also lay stress on the considerable effort made by the countries bordering on russia to carry out, with relatively little outsideassistance, an effective anti*-epidemic, campaign.  -.3iencompared with the resources of these countries, this efforthas been indeed remarkable.      Trusting that your Government will be in a positionto respond generously to this -appeal,                    I have the honour, to be,                         Sir,                    Your obedient Servant,                     ( Sgd . ) D. da GA1SA,                                 president of the Council.8,  Whitehall Gardens,     1.,     2 nd September, 19  .
