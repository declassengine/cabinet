J   //A[^Document ,(LB.  the Property, of His.Britannic Majesty*8 fovernment.)5 Oil.!,               C A B I g 3 T.                   Copytfo.&apos;?)I P v 4268.              Memorandum ,by the. Chancellor of the Exchequer.    1*  I wish  to make some  further observations on the proposals of   the Minister  of  Health with  regard to Housing in CP.4155 and T.P.39.        In  the first place,  I think it should be pointed out that the   figure of  216,000 houses  built under the Local Authorities&apos; Subsidy   and  the  Private  Builders&apos; Subsidy Schemes does not represent any-   thing like the whole contribution of the State to Housing in recent   years.        In addition to the  216,000, the State have built in England   and Wales  the following:-           Houses  constructed by the Ministry of             Munitions now under the Office of Works  .......8,642           Erected by the Ministry of Agriculture under             the Land Set tinman t Scheme...... .approx. 3,000           Erected by the Service Departments for their             civilian employees................... .about_700 ,                                                TOTAL     12,542.   which raises  the 216.000  to  228j342.  In addition  there have been   built in Scotland, apart  from the 28,750 houses under the Subsidy   Schemes, 5,317 houses by  the  various Departments, making a total   of  34,067  .   The grand  total  for Great Britain is  therefore approxi-   mate.lv  562,000 houses,  apart  from the houses built or to be built   without  Subsidy, such  as  the  10,000 under Sir T. Walters&apos; Scheme.        2.    I  entirely agree with  the Ministry of Health&apos;s   criticisms of the Scheme  proposed by Mr. Alban Richards.        31    I  also agree  with  the Minister of Health that   the Trade  Facilities Act  is  not a suitable means for   dealing,with Housing.      It is not likely to attract                                                          the
the Local Authorities; if it did attract them, It would cost?                            *                               fthe Exchequer In the next 3 years something like  1,800,000/j andit would involve the principle of guaranteeing loans raised byLocal Authorities for their ordinary purposes, which I should regard as exceedingly dangerous for the future.     4.    At the same time I must renew my objections to theproposed Scheme for a  3 Subsidy for 80,000 houses.   ThisScheme, which would involve legislation, would be universallyregarded as a renewal of the policy of Housing Subsidy which was brought to an end so recently by the Cabinet.   Private enterprise,it is admitted, i3 once more beginning to build and while it istrue that private enterprise has not yet got down to the working class house, that would naturally come last.   I do not think weshould be acting wisely in the interests of house building and ofemployment in the building trade if we were now to depressprivate activities by further State subsidy to compete with themfor materials and labour.   Is it not better to trust to Schemeslike that recently put forward by Sir T. Walters udder which large industrial combines undertook the building of houses?There Is certainly a grave risk of checking this budding activityif we give further State assistance.          It must also be remembered that we have very difficultyears before us financially in the near future and that TO have very large commitments for contributions to the loan charges oflocal authorities, (and possibly for liabilities under guarantees)which have not yet come home to us.          Finally, apart from special assistance by subsidieswe already give very considerable indirect assistanceto housing in the form of loans from the local loans
Loans Fund.   I summarise this assistance, as it now stands, in the Appendix.     5*  Holding these views very strongly, I am convincedthat any special assistance which we now decide to give to housing, if it is not to defeat its own object, must herestricted within the very narrowest limits.   I am inclined to agree that, having regard to the probable unemploymentin the Building Trade when building under the main SubsidyScheme comes to an end in the early Spring, some further assistance must be given, but I think that assistance should,in the first place, be limited so as not to Interfere withthe actual growth of private enterprise, and secondly, shouldbe definitely connected  with the fact of unemployment-   my proposal would therefore be that we should agree to treat ontho basis of revenues-producing schemes under the St.Davids1Committee Scheme a limited number of hoi-ises to be built by the Local Authorities *  That is to say that, in respectof thoso houses, we should undertake to pay for 5 years 50%of the interest charges.    I think the number of houses tobe admitted under such a scheme should be 5,000, which is asmuch as the Building &quot;Trade are likely to be able to absorbthis winter.    Assuming that a house coots  400,  thiswould mean an additional capital of  2,000,000 and would involve.if the money were raised at 5%,  a charge of  50,000 per annum for 5 years on the Exchequer.     I should be prepared,therefore, to raise the   10,000,000 for which St.Davids&apos;Committee terms may be given, to  12,000,000 in order tocover this item.   This  proposal seems to me to meet thepresent case and to have, the great advantage that it doesnot commit us in tho future because the assistance would automatically cease when the St.Davids&apos;  Grant Scheme ceasod*                                                    It
It would also not involve legislation.                              R * S .H *Treasury Chambers,     9th October, 1922.
