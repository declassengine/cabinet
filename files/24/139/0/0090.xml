The subjects  of native States are deprived ox the freedom of speech,  ofiwriting and of  actions.    No-vspapers in  British India arethe only solace which  can  be reported to by theseoppressed people of IV  tive states in educating the nublicopinion and exposing the inhuman, cruel  ana atrociousactions of  their rulers, and in saving the honour  ofwives and daughters at suoh tyrant hands.  To deprive them of this the only tool explicitly means to drive theunprotected/with all their subtleties, and detailed notes about theirfamous warfare.  Can you arrange for it?
